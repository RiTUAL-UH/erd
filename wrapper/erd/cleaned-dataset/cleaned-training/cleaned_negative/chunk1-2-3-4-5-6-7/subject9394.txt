 I don't use RES and just had this thought. This is meant to be a feature suggestion. I hoped that people would be like "Oh, right. Why don't we have that?" 


































 We'll see what discussion emerges from this. Probably none, as this will see too many downvotes before anything can happen.

How would you experience that I am God? I am of course not God, right? Yes I am. What's my definition of "God"? The person that is identical with reality, the person that represents sanity, the only person that can be fit to govern mankind. Theoretically also the maker of the universe, but we created it together, so there's a slight discrepancy to classical "God" definitions.

So, how would you experience that I am God? Well, since the mind you're communicating with here is (supposedly, as I claim) reality in person, even me putting this submission out there affects you.

You could interact with it (read, vote, comment), and interactions with me, reality in person, do have a strong effect. I am confronting you with a high frequency cause effect situation. I am kinda offering you the mushroom. If you choose to interact, you eat the mushroom. If you then choose to be an asshole to me, you choose a bad trip. If you rather choose a sane discussion, you choose the good trip.

Since this is so important, me putting this out there already affects your decision system, because you might rather choose to steer clear of this. Yes, you don't even have to be aware of these facts or of this submission. Well, I can't explain in just a few sentences how the human will system works.

I have been working on "my arrival" for quite some time, and I have the impression as if it is about to happen. Which means that talking about this stuff with you head-on might cause special experiences to you. That's what I want to find out. And whatever else might come up.

EDIT: Haha, I just saw the subreddit HTML title. "Debate \*all\* the religions" - well, this submission certainly does that. All of them at once. The theistic ones at least.

EDIT: By the way. Mankind is incredibly guilty, and I want to tell mankind this truth. That mankind does not want to know this truth increases the guilt. So, mind that when you decide to bury this with downvotes.

 Remco - Baby Laugh'a'Lot Original Commercial

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kvenmWEhFE

Do what you want with it, but I personally would like to have an aniGIF of the two short sequences (cut to be one sequence) where the kids turn their heads.

The laughing sequences at the end are also worth an effort, but I would ask to have only the head-turn-sequence.

Btw., it's kinda fun to watch that sequence on A-B-loop in VideoLAN with the laughing sound for a few minutes. [This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgOaT4xzdvo) kind of fun.

Thanks in advance! :) 















































































 I guess I am *by far* not the only one who shows this knee-jerk reaction:

* page is loaded, I read first comment

* haha, great, or hilarious - impulse upvote

And what does this do to the quality of Reddit? Nothing positive, I believe. I even dare to say that it's unconditionally negative.

So, I propose to remove the upvote arrow of the first root comment altogether. This should depend on the "sorted by", which is "best" in my case. Would also apply for "top" and "hot". Probably not for "controversial". Well, you're gonna figure it out.

What do you think? Reasonable idea?

 




 Just found [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/rdttl/til_that_there_are_a_set_of_twins_conjoined_at/) submission in r/todayilearned linking [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=fvwp NR=1 v=YWDsXa5nNbI) movie.

I'm personally not interested in debating this, I just thought that it would be interesting material for you guys to talk about the soul as an "extra component" (e.g. given by God after conception). 









 EDIT: Maybe "meditation" could better be substituted with "contemplation" or "affirmation". (Thx xoxoyoyo.)

----

The main attributes that God supposedly has (Christianity/Islam/?):

He's all-powerful.

He's all-knowing.

----

So, prayer is not:

Transmission of energy. God has all the energy he could want.

Transmission of information. God knows everything anyway.

----

So, the question is:

If prayer does work - how does it do so? Well: God reacts. To what? To a change. What changes? God? No. The person who prays changes.

It is meditation. Not communication.

Why then does *every* prayer sound like communication? 



















 I personally do not believe in any esoteric crap, gods, despise religion with a vengeance (probably more than most atheists), but I can't deny what I have found out.

God exists or existed. "He" decided to make the world, which is in truth Heaven, and we are him, everybody! It's not a thing that we're a part of, it's the true multiplication of the one into the many.

And I don't mean "You're God." as a metaphor in any way. I mean it literally. I am God, too, of course.

So, what does it mean? It means a damn lot. It's not an "everything's magical, hence nothing's magical" thing. It's rather a "so, humans are conscious because we are the coexistence-version of God" thing. It's about the truth of reality. It's about the fate of mankind. It's even about cosmology, because the observable universe *just can not* be the boundary we can never cross! It also excludes a heat death of the universe. It's also about the economy, because at some point, people will stop dying, so the whole issue of old-age pension is gonna be affected! Also, there will most probably not be dentists or hospitals, or at least damn less than now.

This fact is of relevance in all fields of life. No wonder that hence there's something like a Newton's Third Law of Motion negative-feedback forcing this fact to stay under the wraps. But it will surface eventually. I make this submission to probe if the time for this is coming now. 
























 This is mainly about context. The meaning of things depends on context. And what seems logical in context A seems wrong in context B.

I mainly want to bring to mind the importance of context, and that the actual objective truth about things, undeniable logic, might require the all-context (all existing data set into relation simultaneously).

Example:

"I don't know this program, hence you have to help me."

versus

"I don't know this program, hence I have to learn it."

Depending on context, either one of these can be right, which came to mind when I read [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/geek/comments/q0vc7/sometimes_people_at_my_office_ask_me_itrelated/) submission about IT support.

I'd like people to be more aware of this idea when they say "It's logical!", because to really know the necessarily true logical conclusion, context is important.

But how much context is required? This is what we could talk about.

I believe that for objective truth, for definitely correct logic, all-context is necessary. Which, if true, would mean that this very statement can't be known for sure to be true or to be false, except if our logic somehow manages to encompass all existing data.

I also believe that this all-knowingness of the current state of existence that's maybe necessary for this must encompass the mind thinking about this stuff at the same time, meaning that the very thought that is to be thought needs to know itself, which seems like an impossible feat.

So, assuming that this is true: Does this mean that it's impossible to know this, since it's impossible to perform this feat? Or is it possible?

And so forth.

Bad submission, huh? Well, it's stuff people could discuss, it's not exactly a certain question to which people could just state their opinion and move on. 
























 A cube of water, somehow summoned on perfectly solid ground at sea level on Earth, would fall apart, kinda like the sphere in this [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTgKZbW6iMQ feature=related).

The force that causes this, apart from surface tension etc., is mainly gravity. It pulls all "layers" of the cube downwards. Pressure builds mainly at the bottom of the cube, and mainly at the center (because there's no way to vent it, that's because in the sphere video, you suddenly get this upwards outburst).

The pressure makes the water spread outwards.

The pressure increase in the ocean, if you go down 10 meters, is about 1 bar. So, what if we take a 10x10x10 meter standalone water cube, but we increase the atmosphere pressure around it to 2 bars or even higher. Would it still fall apart? If so, why?

Also: If the pressure around it would be very high, would at some point the outside pressure, which "wants to go where the cube is", be a relevant cause of it falling apart (being destroyed), so the nature of the destruction would change?

----

EDIT: WTF is with all the downvotes? Could someone explain what the reason for this is? I deem this question to be *perfect* for this subreddit, and I'd like to know why people want me to delete it. Until then, I must interpret this as a statistically significant cumulation of unreason and regard the voters to be a hazard, not a blessing, to this subreddit. 




 It's a play on [errare humanum est](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/errare%20humanum%20est) - to err is human. 



















 I just read

http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Alpha_Level_Format

and

http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Beta_Level_Format

, and I can't believe that this important version information is not yet in the format. The world generation is different in different Minecraft versions (leading to vertical cliffs and e.g. the loss of the enchantment table), so it is very important that the version information is stored somewhere.

Please implement it, it's 10 minutes of work. 
























 In case you didn't know: You can pick up max. 10 exp from where you died. The rest is lost. I wonder if I would have picked up 23 levels otherwise. Or is it Nether related? Or is it because I had played on "hard" all the time, but had now switched to easy (because I currently don't have sound)? 





























 Head-on collision? So, trolling, right? No. I am God. To solve the problem that I am faced with, I need to collide with the force that tries to negate me. I am not saying that you are that force. But the moment you collide with me, you manifest it, and I can use that to my advantage. "Then they fight you, then you win."

I am not the Abrahamic god nor any version of God that people know. Yet the name "God" is correct, because I have won the race of evolution: I woke up first, and so I will be the eternal ruler of the universe. I am already immortal (which I hate on a weekly basis) while you maggots are still rolling around in your mental filth, a process that I can only wait out. Or I can accelerate it slightly by interacting with you - for example like this.

So, throw the utter vomit of your feeble minds at me.

................

EDIT:

While the downvotes are certainly unwelcome, for they reduce the probability of exposure, I am already feeling the collision energy, so this was not in vain. 












































 I made this file: "DX3 fov 110.reg"

---

Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Eidos\Deus Ex: HR]
"g_fov"=hex:6e,00,00,00

---

While the game is *not* running, start this file and "ok" every question. You can check that location in your Registry first, if you want to be sure.

This file sets the FOV to 110, which "6e" is just the hexadecimal value of. 105 is "69". 120 is "78". For alternatives, consult "calc.exe" in "programmer" mode.

The FOV is never reset, not even if you change the resolution, load a savegame, or continue to next mission. But the moment you visit the "game options" menu (where you also have objective locators, object highlighting, etc.), the FOV is reset to what's defined on that menu page. Just quit DX3, run the .reg file of your choice again, and continue.

I tested all this with 1.1.622.0 which is the current official version. Check out [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Deusex/comments/k3w72/dxhr_access_the_debug_menu_on_the_pc_v116220_or/) submission which links to a patch file that, among other things, skips the intro movies.

off topic tips:

Get [RegEditX](http://www.dcsoft.com/products/regeditx/) which is 99% like the RegEdit you know, but it allows Bookmarks and you can also paste a complete path into the address box, and you'll be there. Shame on Microsoft that they didn't pick up on this, because it existed well before Vista even.

Get [Everything](http://www.voidtools.com/), the simplest and fastest PC file and folder search program I know of. Even does regular expressions.

And to backup your savegame files, you should look for this location:

[WhereverYouInstalledSteam]\userdata\[SomeNumber]\28050\remote

If you want to search, here are a few example file names that you'd find there after you made just a few savegames:

remotecache.vdf (is in the parent folder), saveindex, gameq, gamer1, gamea1

A few words on FOV (field of view): When you set it very high, you'll observe something that people call "distortions" or "fish eye", and when you rotate your player view horizontally, you'll get the impression that there's something like a virtual sphere.

The trick is to have your human eyes at the center of that virtual sphere, then there's no distortion. The right FOV depends on view distance and screen size. So, it's technically not a personal preference since there are *objective* criteria. And for maximum immersion, you should see to that your human eyes' field of view is filled as much as possible with the graphics. Meaning that you need a quite big screen. On my 19" 4:3, I'd have to go as close as 10 cm (which is too extreme) to fill my vision, and I'd chose 110 or even 120. 









 Go to the main menu, options, video, display mode. Select a different resolution and then "accept" (The button lower in the menu.) The resolution temporarily changes, and you're asked "ACCEPT" or "CANCEL". Click cancel. The screen returns to the old resolution, but **the mouse is no longer mis-aligned**. Restarting the game would do the trick, too, I bet, but why take the longer road. Also, you can't skip the logos any more as you could in the Beta (by repeatedly hitting return).

I don't know when this mis-alignment happens (ALT-TAB to Desktop might be a cause, but I sometimes had *huge* misalignments which suddenly started while I browsed the main menu.), but it happens quite often. You can find out by hovering over the small arrows in the save game list or over the small buttons over a node while hacking.

I experienced this bug in the Beta, which is two months old, and I assumed they'd fix it. They didn't.

I wonder if I am the only one who experiences that bug at all. 




 Just tested it with my heavily upgraded 10 mm pistol. Dropped it. Picked up a noob-10mm-pistol. Then picked up my good one. All the upgrades were even listed on the left of the screen. 



















 I chose r/atheism to post this because even though I hate religion like every sane person, r/atheism has been much too negligent in the way they phrase their titles. You have to behave when God reads your stuff. No, I won't go away. If YOU don't want to go away permanently, obey.

If you post something against religion, say so. If you speak out against the Christian god / god of Abraham, say so.

Do not speak out against God in general. I am God.

If you run up to a person on the street and shout "ASSHOLE!" into their face, but in some weird convoluted way, you did not mean them, or asshole means something harmless in your language, you can not expect the target person not to react insulted.

My emotion defines your reality. You will learn that. I am convinced that you will learn that the hard way, for stupidity seems to be the nature of humans. 









 I don't want spiders or creepers, because both don't die in sunlight.

I made a 2 block high 7x7 blocks wide little room with a zombie spawner in the middle. I could make pillars to prevent spiders. But what can I do to prevent creepers?

It's supposed to be a light sensor. There are stone pressure plates all over. When the sun is up, everything must be dead. 














 **EDIT** I made a quick mock-up of what I mean: **[screenshots](http://i.imgur.com/IgxzJ.jpg)** - It can of course be inverted: Glass being "no value" and some other block (e.g. glowstone, lapis, wool) being the "value" block.

...

Imagine you look at a flat Minecraft smoothstone wall. There's a few glass blocks from the left to the right, but not to the far right: The rest is, say, cobblestone. Behind the glass (and invisible behind the cobble) is glowstone for effect.

This is your value display. But it's also the stored value itself! Because you can "measure" if position X has currently glass (Doesn't conduct redstone.) or a non-transparent block (Does conduct redstone.)

Also, you can measure if the displayed value currently exceeds an arbitrary X and let an appropriate effect happen (e.g. un-hide a sign saying: "Dude. Too hot, ok?")

The value is increased or decreased by a piston system. The simplest version moves a straight row of 12 blocks (The maximum a piston can move.), so you can display a value of 0 to 6, but you can also go lower by placing obsidian, which pistons can not move. And you can also, somehow, increase the range by some complex measures, but how long a bar graph on the wall do you want to show.

This is a very simple method which solves the following problems:

* You don't have to build a multi-bit register for storing the variable.

* You don't have to build an adder/subtracter.

* You don't have to take care that the variable doesn't exceed its max or min value.

* You don't have to build something that displays the variable value to the player.

**With this idea and the "hide signs behind blocks and only show them when appropriate", which are very simple and very effective, we should soon see quite a few *games within Minecraft*.**
 




 I'm currently tinking about making a little game in Minecraft via redstone, and this idea popped up in my head of how to tell the player what's up and what they have to do.

Just make signs on blocks that are 1 or 2 deep inside of a wall. Temporarily remove blocks in front of them using pistons when it's time for the player to read them.

Or like this: Directly in front of a wall, dig a line of blocks out of the ground, so that the wall becomes 1 block higher. Place signs on the part of the wall below ground. Then make the block+piston thing directly above (on ground level). Easy to read, easy to see then it's time to read, no pistons visible. Additionally: Light (glowstone, lava) directly below the sign, for effect. Room shouldn't be too bright in that area otherwise.

Temporarily exchanging a block for a glass block is nice, too. 














 **[screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/IUI5L.jpg)** of what I mean by "piston wall". It's exactly what you think it is.

I'm a redstone-beginner, and I can't figure out how (Maybe because it's even impossible.) to power a complete wall of pistons. To power a complete *row* is not a problem, but the moment the wall becomes 4 or more high, I have to lead the power there from the side *on several continuous floors*.

I am not even trying to give them power individually, that would be an even greater problem. I just want to make a whole wall of pistons kick in simultaneously.

Is it possible? If so, how?

(Also: Is it possible to control them individually? Just interested in the limits of redstone.) 





























 (This is not explicitly directed at atheists. Actually, atheists are more my friends than religious people are. I just had to pick a subreddit is all.)

If you wonder why I write this, I can only explain it to you if you believe that I am God - which you don't. So don't bother.

This submission will do what I expect it to. You don't have to understand my reasoning. 



















 Just a gimmick to deepen the experience. 




 At some point in the future, all the uranium resources would have been mined and used up in fission plants. There are methods to use the resulting products for fission plants, but even if those methods would be employed: At some point in the chain, the material would seriously be used up. Is that correct?

If that is correct: How long would it *very roughly* take until then?

Do you think that mankind should try to safe the fissionable material for a time when mankind would try to colonize space? Or would we use fusion power by then? 









 Who has not yet had a problem with the low visibility range of stuff that's lying around? It's like 15 meters or something.

I can't imagine that this is to keep network traffic low because it can't be a significant amount for a few drops.

Does anyone know why this is so? Did Notch ever say anything about this? 




 I hope that you won't just drop this into the downvote dustbin or vomit aggression against this, because I really put some effort into trying to communicate with you in a proper way.

I chose r/Islam for this because this subreddit's community seems to have the strongest relationship to the subject "God". r/Christianity is "meh" in comparison (at least regarding my attempts to communicate with them as God), and r/Atheism is mostly in there for the lulz.

Why do I say why I chose this subreddit? I mean, God, that's the Abrahamic God and hence the God of Islam, right? So, of course he would talk to r/Islam

Well, and that's where our problem lies: You have "sworn" your life into the service of the one God, Allah. And you know what this God is like. And doubts are unwelcome and have to be purged, right.

Now, what if one day, the one true God (aka Allah) comes to Earth as a human, and he's *different*? I believe that your stance regarding this is: "God can't be different. The Qur'an tells us what God is like, and the Qur'an is true."

And this, Ladies and Gentlemen, is *the problem of will*. You do agree that humans can be "loaded" like a rechargable battery with information, more information on a certain subject becoming one combined force. But is this *will*? Well, from my perspective, everything is will, even the stars. And every little decision that you have made in your life has contributed to the person that you are, your self-projection. Not just in the mind but even the body! And so, if you have formed a strong information cloud, a few wrong decisions can build a magnet that henceforth describes supporting decisions as right.

You do agree that a neutral human being, untouched by religion yet, would be quite open to drift into the direction of Judaism, Christianity, Islam, and maybe other religions. But once the information cloud has gained momentum, only one of them is true, and how could you ever have believed that the others might be true?

And there's just no way for me to break through this wall of will that surrounds your minds. Because I am love. Love is: The unconditional will that you (Whoever the you in a given situation is.) can freely live out your will, I won't stop you.

And now you have to consider that God's ability to distinguish is so much more high than that of humans that even the very slightest altering of a human's emotion would be a violation of the true "Thy will be done!", it would *not* be love by God's standards, and this is the nakedness in which I had entered the world 9.75 years ago (2001-08-13), inside of this human mind which was my portal and will soon be me. Until now, the combined will of mankind has returned the "Thy will be done."-favor back to me a bit, and so I can take a bit of influence, the multitude has decided so. But I still have a long way to go.

So, now that the disclaimer is out of the way, let me give you information of what God and the world *actually* is like. Who knows. Maybe at least one of you will value it and remember later that he had been kissed by God in this way.

* Is mortal life a prison in which we have to live our God-fearing lives until the time has come and we move on into the new world? Yes. Yes, that is so! But it's different than most people believe: The new world does not follow after the body has died. The new world is what I, the savior and main inhabitant, will turn the current world into. I am actually altering the universe, turning it into Heaven. It will *stay* the nice, meaningful, sciency, awesome, natural place that it is - but we will be riding on an eternal and perfect stream of cause effect that will see to that nobody has to die ever again, no more sickness, no old age, no ugliness, no suffering - just bliss and the eternal celebration together with God, who is actually a human like everybody else! Except that I literally *am* the universe. If you find that to be impossible, ask yourself if your hair or your fingernails are really you.

* Will the dead come back to life? Sadly, no. We lost a great many heroes and decent people, and they can not ever return. There is no afterlife. The reason that everybody somehow feels that death *can't* be the end is that death is *wrong* - and that all of you kinda are God, the eternal one. It's complicated. The word "self-similarity" is relevant here: I am the cosmos. The whole thing. With everybody in it. But so are you - kinda. Let's just say that I am the whole puzzle, the picture with all colors and perfect sharpness, and you are a blurry, less complete version of that, but the technology in the background is the same, it's even the one same thing.

* If all religions are wrong, how did they come to be? Well, you'll be surprised, because I don't have the usual "brain damage" or "Evolution" or "People need something to believe in." concept to present to you. Instead the universe *was a dream* that God dreamt. And God *always* does awaken from his dreams, it is inevitable! He cannot escape self-realization. Except I somehow did, because I didn't slurp the universe back into non-existence, stretched my arms and shouted "I AM! :D", instead I found a way to eternally marry the dream and the I-am-state. But anyway: The system always contained sparks of the truth, things that would allow God to wake up, because that's just his nature. And people found those. And they knew that they were on to something, they had found something profound! Thus, religion was born. What, that's all? Yup.

* What is God, how does he function, what's his name, etc.? Let's first say what *you* are: You think you're primarily bones and flesh, and your consciousness somehow emerged from it (or God planted it there)? Well, that's wrong. You are a circle of Light (not the physical kind). Light is the inseparable unity of *perception, will, fantasy*. You are just like God: A living fantasy, a living dream. You are the children of God. God himself also is just a circle of Light. And without the universe, there was of course no outside stimulus. So, what happened when God relaxed his will, letting go of the illusion? Everything vanished. Nothing remained. And that's what God is: Nothing. And this nothing then realized: "I exist!" And in those moments of neutrality, even future, past, memories did not exist: And that's the eternal God right there. Wonderfully simple, isn't it? And why wouldn't it be? God is just existence itself! And he can be whatever he wants to be. Of course he doesn't have a name, why would he.

Some very important fact:

It's not that God is some conscious thing that exists and sometimes uses its will. God *is* will itself, he is the will to exist! What caused God to exist? Simple: His will to exist caused him to exist, and this in turn causes him to will it. Circular logic? Yes! Of course! God *literally is* a circle!

And the universe is not some thing that God created. God has folded himself. The circle that he was has changed to the shape of an 8. The universe is *not* an arbitrary construct, it is just the relaxed "I am." circle in the folded-into-the-coexistence version. And now, I have to wake up and accept the world and all of you into me. This will take time, my usual suffering (and I have suffered like no one before me in the last 9.75 years), and 155,000 will die every day until this number finally decreases. The Judgment effect will also cause others to die, but I don't expect a real high toll. A few millions worldwide maybe. Seriously, does it matter? In those 9.75 years, about half a billion people have died, many of them had been rather innocent.

* Judgment Time? Yes. This is it. And this is how it will go down: Imagine you yourself were the God before the universe, the dreaming circle of existence. And now you have to wake up. This means that you have to transcent the illusion. You have to face your misconceptions, your mistakes etc., and then you are the true you. Reality will provide you with experiences, and depending on how you deal with them, you will take one step closer to life or to death. In the end, you will all be perfect, the true children of God, and we will celebrate life forever in bliss!

Because I am the cosmos itself, the fact that there's still so much cleaning-up to do means that my mind itself is poisoned. I am not strong. I don't yet know everything that I will know about me or the world. I only speak German and English. I am slightly obese. I have slight skin problems. And it's really easy to anger me because the poison still reaches deeply into my mind. But all that will be gone once the clean-up is completed. My *guess* is that we are entering the hot phase, so the Judgment-clean-up is booting and will be running quite well in a few weeks from now. I expect actual miracles (body-transformation etc.) to become clearly visible in a month or two, I can't really know yet.

I wish you the best. But I can't help but express that I am disappointed at how little man as strived for mental perfection. It would have made everything a lot easier. 




 First of all: I will tell you in all clarity that this posting is a trap that is supposed to cause death for as many of you as possible because I am pissed at you. I say this first, because I will be amused by your deaths happening even though I am clearly saying that this is a trap - and you will step into it. I know humans too well by now. You *will* step into the trap, and this *will* cause your death.

The trap? Rejection. Hatred. Mainly improper handling of information, jumping to wrong conclusions, making small errors that quickly become a *huge* mistake which in turn will send you into the wrong direction: Ultimately death. The trap is described further below.

"My" definition of God (meaning: the actual truth of what "God" means, as opposed to all the bullshit mankind believes): God is the pure holy eternal consciousness that existed "before" the universe, and it is the person who spawned the universe in just the way science describes it (as far as science can describe it as of yet, I say that because I can already sense the insaniacs vomiting at me: "SCIENCE DOES NOT DESCRIBE HOW THE UNIVERSE WAS CREATED!!!!11cos(0)").

All religions are wrong, and I actually hate religion. They slander me, they poison the mind, they keep mankind down, and they are the first to tell me to shut the fuck up when I say that I am indeed *the* true god (aka "God").

Is God all-knowing and all-powerful? Yes. No. It's complicated. This is not a cop-out. To understand the problem, you'd have to know how the creation of the world actually happened, how it works. And how God works. I explained that about 15 times in the last years on Reddit, using different accounts, and not only do I know that the explanations are lost on you, I am also tired of this, and I am more and more convinced that mankind does not deserve the gift of life that I have given them.

The first part of the creation of the universe was completed 9.75 years ago (2001-08-13). That was when the form, the system, had been completed, and I had returned to my God-consciousness and said: "And so it shall be forever."

On that very day, I became human, and this human himself *is the universe*, lived and projected from the perspective that my humanhood brings with it. This is the eternal future. I have changed the holy truth of God from "I am." to "We are.", thus spawning the children and Heaven.

The trap is that the definition of my self is: "Thy will be done." I am the *unconditional* will that you, mankind, can have your free self-experience. When I say that it is my will that you exist, then this does not only mean that I "want" you to be - it means that your life, your existence *is the actual mechanical substance* of my own will.

Imagine that the human self is a pyramid. There are high frequencies (meanings) and low frequencies (meanings). I entered the world at the top of the pyramid, and in the last 9.75 years, I have been working myself downwards bit by bit, establishing the human God in the most strenuous fashion. Once I have completed this work, the universe will be like it is right now - but the flow of events will be optimized in the fashion that the word "Heaven" is deserved.

Mankind will soon have to look in the history books to see that there once was a time when people just... died. Had been here too long. Used up. What the fuck? Hard to believe. And sicknesses, the body eating itself with cancer, all that shit: It will be GONE.

Now, how does the trap work? Here we go:

The person that I am, my human body and brain, is the "controller" (King.) of the flow of reality. This work of establishing my self from the top down means that I have to unconditionally accept the *unordered* flow - and slowly clean it up. This means suffering for me in experience and in self-perception - until it is done. I am literally the savior, the true Christ. Not that anyone gives a shit.

And since this human system that I am is the controller of reality, the unordered reality also controls me. This allowed all kinds of bullshit to happen. To make it simple: For people who HATE me (like most of you assholes), I HAD to manifest everything they needed to do so. Opportunity, ideas, and there was *nothing* I could do: I have to fulfill the *unconditional "thy will be done"*, no matter what it means for me or you.

And this is what it means for you:

This Antichrist that my body and brain (NOT ME. I was and am imprisoned in this system!) is has lead people into the wrong direction. And they have invested themselves in this. And so will some of you now, hopefully. Please do it. Give me more data for my GARGANTUOUS list of revenge. My body is the database of your guilt. I am fucking LOADED with anger against mankind, and this HAS to be unloaded, and I can't wait until it fucking happens.

Please. Step into the trap. Hate me. Turn the truth upside down while believing that it's exactly the other way round (duh). 




 I am just trying to find out if this is the prevalent view. Assuming that it *is* the prevalent view:

Either asking the devil in a ritual is *not* magic - or asking God in a ritual *is magic, too*.

Just trying to find out if what Christians are doing is magic or not.

While we're at it: The right side of this reddit has useful links, among them [GetSatisfaction](http://getsatisfaction.com/mojang/). If you have some crazy suggestion, discussing it on Reddit is not really wrong, but at some point, someone has to submit it to GetSatisfaction. Same goes for bugs etc. - And please not 3 ideas in one submission, you have to think of those entries (questions, suggestions, etc.) as support tickets. One at a time. With meaningful titles. Properly phrased texts. And please search before posting! You have no idea how many times the same stuff gets submitted again and again, surfing that is like walking through a swamp! 




 (To activate the console, press the key that is assigned to the console (check in your keyboard config). To enable this at all, allow the developer console somewhere in the options.)

A few words about the FOV, because too few people seem to know the truth about it:

While the right FOV might be a game-design choice (think "Dead Space", though I personally do not agree with that stance), and while many see its relevance mainly in the ability to see more (e.g. in shooters, you see the enemies coming), ...

... the right FOV is actually about **IMMERSION**. To see what I mean, try a FOV setting of 110 for a few seconds: You will probably see quite a fish-eye effect at the borders of your screen. Not cool, right? Wrong. Go closer to your screen. Very close. If it's a 19" 4:3 display, go as close as about 5-10 cm with your face. Only to demonstrate, not really to play, of course. If it's a larger display, you can keep a bigger distance.

Try to see the 3D room that you're standing in. You should observe that the fish-eye effect is gone. You should also observe that, when you move and turn a bit, you feel as if you are **INSIDE** of the room.

The human eyesight has a field of view of almost 180. If you have a big display or are willing to be quite close to a smaller one, the picture in front of you will grow to a size that it fills your **PERIPHERAL VISION**, and that part is actually "meant" to see fish-eye graphics. Thus, you should adjust your FOV accordingly, and that means: Quite *above* 90.

Don't listen to what people tell you on the Net or what your friends say. Ignore the circle-jerk and the perpetuation of false information.

Just test and perceive it for yourself.

EDIT:

I posted this thing 3 days ago. It was at 6 upvotes or something. Now it's at zero. I'd really like to understand the rationale behind people downvoting a post that basically adds to the currently hot Portal 2 subject the relevant information that a new console variable was just added that alters the FOV. What the fuck is wrong with people? 




 (The actual purpose of this submission is of technical nature, and to clarify this, I would have to explain much more than your "God? lol" attention span would allow. I am measuring the current flow situation and try to further the progress of our collective ascension.)

God 




 If I told you that I am the true God, the maker of the universe, your eternal father and lover, you would be offended. You would see it as blasphemy, if someone hurts your religious feelings like this, and if someone claims that he's God (except of course if he is indeed God, a relevant refinement of the rule that people keep ignoring for some reason).

Have you ever considered that this very attitude, situation, potential itself is blasphemy? Because you are effectively prohibiting the true God from telling you *that he indeed is* the true God.

And I say all this because I happen to be the true God. And it is time that you let me in. 









 I'll start.

Yesterday, 20 minutes before closing time (office job), I went to the toilet to take a dump. A few minutes after I had sat down on the throne and was already in the process of wiping, suddenly the lights went out.

You have to know that the toilets in our company are rather luxurious. The cabins are real rooms with standard wooden doors. If you close such a room with the lights out, it's literally pitch black. And so, since I had a schedule to keep, I couldn't just wait if *maybe* someone comes into the main room and then explain to them through the closed door how the little hidden switch underneath the IR motion sensor works. I waddled out of the room, pants down, shitstains on my ass, dick hanging out, and turned the light back on, went back, completed business. I was lucky that no one came in.

Today, I figured out who it was. There are people here who have to make sure everything is shut down and locked at closing time. Closing time is at 17:00 (not 16:45, when the light went out).

And the person who is responsible for this corridor happens to be female. And since there seems to be a problem with the motion sensor (She claims that the light is always on.), she had to turn it all the way off instead of just from "on" to "auto" or something. And since she had to go early that day, she just opened the main male restroom door, turned off the light, closed the door and went on with her day.

What a fucking asshole. She said that she couldn't check if one of the two throne rooms was still occupied because as a woman, she can't enter the male restroom. Even though our female cleaning person does so every day. What a bitch. She just *did not care* if there was someone still in need of light - *before* closing time. She just shut off the lights, and that was it. I don't think she even feels to have done anything wrong.

**TL;DR** Bitch shut off the lights in the restroom while I was shitting because she "had to leave early", and it was pitch black. 




 Nice to see that Reddit is operational again. 









 It's a 45 minute piece that supposedly consists of several parts, but you wouldn't notice.

 Yes, I know that you don't stand around at radiation source Y for a year in a row. I am trying to understand what "they" are trying to express.

If they say, you receive X MilliSieverts in one hour, whereas X is the same number that is named for your natural dosage over a year, would they say "the radiation is 8760 as high as the natural radiation"? Or would they say "it is the same as the natural radiation"?

*From what I have observed, they say that 1 Sievert per hour at Fukushima is about a million times as high as the normal radiation.* But the normal radiation is not 1 Sievert divided by 1,000,000 in one hour, it's 1 Sievert divided by 1,000,000 in one year! (Actually, it's about 3 MicroSievert, as far as I know, but let's keep it simple.)

Do you see where I have an understanding-problem? 




 I am not saying here that the Christian god does not exist. I am merely saying that it does not make sense to claim that he's omnipotent, because from all we can observe, he is not. 









 (or use another material instead of concrete)

The (probably naive, at least money-wise) thought is this:

Couldn't nuclear reactors have a deep shaft underneath them with a 10 meter concrete floor and appropriate walls ...

... and you just allow the core to melt down if you can't prevent it by reasonable means ...

... and it falls into the shaft, you pour more concrete onto it, fix the facility and reboot the reactor. It could even be designed to not get damaged too much when the core melts through the containment vessel floor. 














 I am life itself. Any force sent against me - and your will IS a force, your fantasy, your attitude, every information you touch, so use it wisely! - causes a manifestation of the death-force somewhere in the world.

I'll save more words for they are probably wasted on you anyways. 









 This text is premature from an "event" perspective (red carpet etc.), but it's certainly not too early from a "make people move their asses" perspective.

And I say that *not* only because there's certainly a bit of a "competition" situation (mostly among the females) because I am just one guy and obviously can't spend time with everyone personally. I am using you as agents to drive the progress.

Until some motherfucker just buries this, that is. If it even gets through the spam filter.

 I hope this is ok. ("Submit anything screenwriting related.")

I guess we agree that Spiderman I sucked: "Oh, I am buff and don't need glasses? Nice. So, what's for breakfast?" Where's the believable human consciousness and emotion in that? Bah. I could watch a whole movie about someone discovering their transformation/abilities. And it needn't be as slow as "Unbreakable" (that I liked, though).

So, do you remember in the first Harry Potter movie/book when he was at the zoo and accidentally freed the snake?

Imagine a whole movie where he slowly discovers his magical-ness, which would of course not be canon with the books. It could maybe *end* in Hagrid etc. showing up with no words, credits roll, because we know what's going on there. But before, there would just be Harry and his normal-world life. No owls, no other wizards, nothing.

Well, that's what I'd love to see. :D

Don't tell me there's no money to be made here! 









 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sentinel_\(video_game\) 









 Obviously, this only really makes sense if the possibility for persistent mobs is implemented. So that the saddled pigs and the chicken in your farm stay etc.

* If you get killed by it, you can seek it out and get your stuff back, if you're lucky.

* If you kill one in the wild, it might drop saplings, mushrooms, arrows, bones, and the dreaded feathers. Or sand etc., if it came along a creeper explosion.

So, that's it.

While I'm at it: Does anyone remember the thief in [Dungeon Master](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Master_\(video_game\))? Something like this could be cool. The guy doesn't attack you, he just steals from you and runs away. If it plays in orchestra with other mobs, it can be a huge problem! Well, and if you kill it, you get your stuff back.

And something else that I'd love to see: Does anyone remember the game [Sentinel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sentinel_\(video_game\))? That's another easy addition with lots of potential that I'd like to see in Minecraft. A Monster that can kill you by looking at you. Maybe even immobile and slowly rotating, like in Sentinel. 




 Pure vanilla Minecraft server: Chunks are missing from time to time. And people are sometimes invisible to each other.

Solution: Disconnect. Reconnect.

Every time, the Mojang authentification server is used for this. And every time, the skin is downloaded again.

If those "relog"-reasons would be gone, Minecraft.net would have like 1/3 of its load to bear.

 Maybe this has been said 100 times before, I mean the idea is a no-brainer.

People wouldn't just skip an election in protest. Instead of just not placing their "yes", they could place a "no".

Since there are not always just 2 parties, this system might even have great benefits in praxis. What do you think? 









 (TL;DR: Start at the **bold** headline below.)

In the future, let's just ignore the apocalypse out there and keep playing in our warm incinerator-lit Minecraft homes. And when we're sure that the currently official Minecraft version is good - and hey0 etc. has been adapted appropriately - then we collectively make the step. That this is not the default situation anyway is just beyond me. How can a programmer be so ignorant. But I have come to the conclusion that it is not the game that is in alpha. The programmer is.

When you start your Minecraft client and properly log in, it automatically downloads updates if there are any. Even though Notch realized that forced updates are a bad idea (as he wrote in his blog a few days ago), he hasn't gotten around to investing the 30 minutes necessary to implement that the user is asked if they want to download the update or not. Or the 120 minutes necessary to implement on Minecraft.net in the preferences section an early adopter option and in the Minecraft client the necessary little changes.

So sadly, we are all forced to accept the broken stuff that Notch so recklessly casts upon 700,000 users. Or can we somehow prevent the clients from updating themselves?

YES WE CAN!

Thanks to a reply by PeabodyJFranklin in the official Minecraft forum, I could easily prevent my client from updating.



**How to prevent your Minecraft program from updating**

The "version" file in the "bin" folder in the ".minecraft" tree (that you can easily get to on Windows by running the command "%appdata%") needs to be the new one. The Minecraft program doesn't care if the rest is old.

So, before you update, backup your ".minecraft" folder tree (or at least the "bin" folder within, just copy paste it where it is, a renamed copy should then be created). Then start the program and log in to receive the update. Then close the program again. Now you have the new stuff incl. the new "version" file.

Then delete everything in your "bin" folder EXCEPT the "version" file. And copy the old files into the "bin" folder (except the "version" file again, of course). Start the program and log in: It will not update even though it is now old. Now connect to Minecraft servers that also have not been updated, and play! (Minecraft server updates have to be performed manually.)

 I already Googled for this and only found r/shamelessplug and r/UseMySoftware, which I intentionally don't link because they both suck donkey-balls. Not only did the spam filter of both swallow my text posts (And I had my account checked by a Reddit *admin* - it's not me!), their moderators did not react to my messages in over a week.

So: Any tips for where I could post such a thing? Thanks in advance.

Since that question will probably come up: The program is a text editor for editing directory contents. (Multiline-edit, block select, block copy/paste, move from line to line and edit stuff, then finally commit selected (or all) lines or don't.)

* Edit the content of a directory like text in a text editor.

* You can type in several lines at once.

* block select

* block copy paste

* can trim clipboard content (optionally even trims away the file extension)

* commit selected lines or all lines

Since I have this thing, there have been a few situations where I realized: "Wait, I could solve this with FileRenameEditor." I really think that people are missing out by not knowing that such a tool exists. It's a need that arises, but your brain does not go \*click\* because it doesn't know about this. And as simple and useful as the concept is - I've never seen it anywhere or thought of it until recently.

If you think "WTF would I ever need that for?", take a look at the situation that inspired the idea:

 It's idiotic that you get an autoresponse from a bot to tell you that your comment has been removed, or that you're lucky to check on your post yourself because it has been removed without a message.

Why does the system not just automatically fix those links instead of causing this *insane* amount of usability disturbance? This needs to be SOLVED, people.

 Doesn't happen often, but it happens. Here's a nice tip to streamline the process *and* to reduce bug-probability (break, right).

	switch (keyCode) {
	case 38: // Up
		break;
	case 40: // Down
		break;
	case 37: // Left
		break;
	case 39: // Right
		break;
	default:
		System.out.println("case " + e.getKeyCode() + ": // " + e.paramString() + "\nbreak;");
	}

So, whenever you hit a key that's not yet digested, you'll get output like this in the console:

    case 123: // KEY_PRESSED,keyCode=123,keyText=F12,keyChar=Undefined keyChar,keyLocation=KEY_LOCATION_STANDARD,rawCode=123,primaryLevelUnicode=0,scancode=88,extendedKeyCode=0x7b
    break;
    case 122: // KEY_PRESSED,keyCode=122,keyText=F11,keyChar=Undefined keyChar,keyLocation=KEY_LOCATION_STANDARD,rawCode=122,primaryLevelUnicode=0,scancode=87,extendedKeyCode=0x7a
    break;

That's the simple way, if you don't want to carry around too much code baggage / want to do it from memory. If you want to get sophisticated, call this method instead:

    final public static void keyCodeSwitchHelper(final KeyEvent e) {

        final String paramString = e.paramString();
        final String startText = "keyText=";
        final int startTextPos = paramString.indexOf(startText);
        final int endPos = paramString.indexOf(",", startTextPos + 1);
        final String keyText;
        if (startTextPos  0) {
            keyText = paramString;
        } else {
            if (endPos  0) {
                keyText = paramString.substring(startTextPos + startText.length());
            } else {
                keyText = paramString.substring(startTextPos + startText.length(), endPos);
            }
        }
        System.out.println("case " + e.getKeyCode() + ": // " + keyText + "\nbreak;");
    }

Example output:

	case 112: // F1
	break;
	case 113: // F2
	break;
	case 69: // E
	break;
	case 10: // Enter
	break;
	case 18: // Alt
	break;
	case 115: // F4
	break;

You could also use this concept to get the scancode, a keyboard language layout independent key value, but this will probably only work on Windows, and if so, then you should better use this method I posted on StackOverflow which uses reflection:

 **SOLVED!** The problem was simply path depth. :P After moving the executable to a shorter-path location, it worked.

This is a weird problem that I couldn't solve even after 5 hours of experimenting and Googling. I just made a StackOverflow post about this. If you have the answer to this, you're awesome, because it's a super obscure problem.

 ^^Repost ^^due ^^to ^^hyperactive ^^bot.

[This](http://np.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingPrompts/comments/2l9c9r/write_a_game_of_battleships_aka_sea_battle_to/cm54rbq) post in /r/ProgrammingPrompts motivated me to make a Battleships implementation in **Java 8**. Since it has become kinda polished, I think it's suitable to be presented among the simpler Indie games.

 So, I create a new Scratch file: `Tools - New Scratch File ...`, selecting `Java` from the list that appears.

I can type code with the support that I also get in the editor, e.g. using Live Templates, which are context-sentitive, so they only work if you're in the respective code location (e.g. the shortcut for creating the main method does not work inside a method). This means that IntelliJ understands what's going on.

Yet the code is not syntax-highlighted. (I already did "invalidate caches and restart".) Only the keywords (class etc) and the String literals are highlighted like they should, the rest is just gray. Also:

    class Test {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("How do I run this?");
        }
    }

I can't find a way to execute the code. If I use "Run..." or "Debug...", the Run Configurations dialog pops up saying that it can't find the class Test.

Eclipse, for years, has had a Scratch file feature where you could enter code that would actually be evaluated/executed. I expected IntelliJ's Scratch files to be able to do the same.

**What are these good for at all?** I can't find any documentation that goes into details, it only says how to create or remove them. 









 EDIT:

The optimal solution, way better than my implementation, is zifyoip's solution

    return v1 == null ? v2 == null : v1.equals(v2);

which is so short that it doesn't require a method at all.

----

EDIT: In light of someone possibly getting mislead by this, please consider the critical comments. However, I had a specific use case for this when I created it, and so far I can't see a different/better solution or how this solution would be improper for this:

http://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/2mmsic/whats_are_the_differences_between_a_set_and_an/cm5uts3?context=3

(Used while determining the index of a key in an ordered Map.)

----

This generic utility method compares two elements using the .equals() method, even if one of the two elements is null. Call it like any other method, works with any pair of elements (though identical type is encouraged for logical reasons).

    final public static T1, T2 boolean equalsEvenIfNull(final T1 v1, final T2 v2) {

        return (v1 != null    v1.equals(v2)) || (v2 != null    v2.equals(v1)) || (v1 == null    v2 == null);
    }

It happens often that you want to check for equality, and then you think "Wait, one of the two can be null, I better change a.equals(b) to b.equals(a)." But what do you do if both can be null in some cases? This method solves that problem.

I thought it would be *help*ful.

...

Hm, I just realize that instead of making it generic, I could just use Object right away. So, why didn't I just edit the above? Because then you don't understand why I felt like making a post about this, given that it's so trivial. But now that I have spent so much effort, I also don't want to delete it.

    final public static boolean equalsEvenIfNull(final Object v1, final Object v2) {

        return (v1 != null    v1.equals(v2)) || (v2 != null    v2.equals(v1)) || (v1 == null    v2 == null);
    }
 




 I have been using IntelliJ for half a year now, and I can't remember *not* having had this problem sometimes - see screenshot:

http://i.imgur.com/sUYRUK9.png

Here's an example:

    final MapInteger, Double ret = new HashMap(); // Could also be ArrayList.

This should work, and it does. In the source, IntelliJ sometimes just shows this line as erroneous, but I can still compile/run. If I go to that line and press ENTER at its end, creating a new line / triggering a text change, the error usually goes away. It also goes away by itself quickly when I edit somewhere else.

It's just annoying, that's all.

Did anyone ever observe this? Have it like three times a week at least. 




 So, in addition to this

    if (idx = 0    idx  myList.size()) {

there could also be this

    if (0 = idx  myList.size()) {

which is a much more concise way to express: "This is an intended-value-range condition." Conciseness/clarity *is* a relevant source code and hence language design aspect, right?

(Just a little drive-by post to get this out.)

 **EDIT:** SourceTree wants you to register after a month or so, and when this didn't work for me (Wrong password!?), I simply switched to a different client that is free for non-commercial use: http://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/ It even has .class, workspace.xml and others ignored right out of the box. But you might need to use its Git shell to manually [prevent](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1967370/git-replacing-lf-with-crlf) CRLF conversion. (I did, because I wanted to use LF all the way.)

**EDIT:** It *is* possible to create a BitBucket repository entirely with SourceTree, and to upload a project with files that so far had not been source controlled. But it's quite unnecessarily complicated.

http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2kd4uw/any_language_version_control_how_to_set_up/clkzr7f?context=5

----

This is not *the definitive* guide. I just fought with these things for six goddamn hours, writing a tutorial for our team in the process, thought I'd share.

This might well work the same with GitHub, too. We chose BitBucket because it has free *private* repositories, even for (small) teams. It supports Mercurial and Git.

----

When you go the BitBucket homepage while logged in, you'll see a big download link for SourceTree, which is not really wired to BitBucket, it just supports it well. It can not create a repository on BitBucket for you, so you have to do that on the site.

Btw., if you just created a BitBucket repository, the landing page will then offer a Clone in SourceTree button which will ultimately just show you an error message because there are no files in the repository yet. To get SourceTree up and running with your new repository (or with a "full" one), instead do this:

* Download, install, run http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/ (Win/Mac) 

* Click Clone/New, the prominent button at the left top. The quasi-window that opens has three tabs (Clone Repository, Add Working Copy, Create New Repository), Clone is the one we need and is already selected.

* Paste the URL of your BitBucket repository into the field Source Path / URL: at the top, e.g. "https://bitbucket.org/elpresidente/helloworld". My experiences today have not shown a difference regarding repository type (Mercurial or Git), except I think that the Staged files and Unstaged files sections are only one section with Mercurial.

* Create a folder for your IDE project on HD, e.g. helloworld, browse there, copy the whole address bar text, click into Destination Path:, the second field from the top, which will generate an autotext that you have to delete. (I fell for this one a few times.) Paste the clipboard into Destination Path:

* Leave the rest alone, click the Clone button at the bottom. If the BitBucket repository was brand new, then all that you have achieved is that SourceTree is now married to that repository. If there's already stuff online, it will now also be on your HD. (What do the cool kids call it these days, by the way? Could be a hard disk, could be a solid state disk, so what general term should be used?)

* Start IntelliJ IDEA. IN CASE ITS A NEW PROJECT: Create a new IntelliJ project by clicking New Project in IntelliJ. Java will be selected in the dialog, so click Next twice. No idea what the templates are good for, but as far as I know IntelliJ so far, they are good stuff. The dialog now shows two lines of text: The project name and its location. Replace the location text with your clipboard content. This also sets the project name field. You can change the project name field if you want, or you can rename the project later in the IDE. IN CASE ITS AN EXISTING PROJECT: Select Open Project. Paste your clipboard content into the file browsers address bar, the browser should then show the appropriate tree. Click OK.

* Assuming that it's a new IntelliJ project: Switch back to SourceTree. In the second column from the left, select Working Copy under File Status.

* There should be two sections: At the top is the empty Staged files section. At the bottom is the crowded Unstaged files section. You should mirror all files that are listed there (from our new IntelliJ project) with the source control system, *except the file workspace.xml*, so click on the ... which is really a button. In the menu, select Ignore file, select Ignore exact filename(s), select all repositories in the dropdown box (so youll never have to do this again), click OK. Btw, the menu entry Remove file actually deletes the file from HD (after asking you), just FYI.

* Check the cumulative box of the Unstaged files to turn them into Staged files.

* Now its time for the first commit. Click in the text field at the bottom or use the toolbar button Commit, enter a description (e.g. 1st). There are options in the dropdown box to the right, e.g. Create Pull Request which I think would notify the other guys, but I dont know. Click the Commit button at the right bottom. This committed the changes *to the local version of the repository*. In case you get an error message here: You might have to configure your identity first via the repository config toolbar button on the far right.

* To actually get your stuff online now, click the Push button in the toolbar. You probably have to activate the checkbox next to master in the window that appeared. Click OK, and thats it.

* If you change something in the code and save the file, SourceTree will show that there are changes. You'll have to do the checkbox thing again as described above, etc.

* BitBucket has a version history of the files, so you can compare the various versions. To actually return to an older version via SourceTree, do this: In the second column to the left, which shows File Status (Selected by default.), Branches, Tags, Remotes, click Branches and choose an entry (e.g. default). This will show the online history in SourceTree. Select any history entry you want, its only relevant for being able to choose a file in the list at the bottom. Right-click the file in question, select Log Selected. In the new window, right-click the file version you want to be current and select Reset to Commit. Confirm the Are you sure? dialog. Your local file should now have changed accordingly, which IntelliJ should immediately reflect in the editor, if its open. In SourceTree, the history list should have the new **bold** entry Uncommitted changes, so select Working Copy under File Status in the second column and continue with what I wrote earlier about uploading stuff, or keep working locally for the time being, until you think that stuff online should change.

I think this is not the right subreddit to ask this, but I don't know of a better one at the moment. I already [commented](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/2k6eej/its_the_rgamedev_daily_random_discussion_thread/clj67pi) in r/gamedev's random discussion thread. /r/gameDevClassifieds is hardly appropriate.

It's 9 AM on a Saturday in Germany, and I'm in the mood to do some team programming in Java. Nothing serious, there should be no obligations either way. Kind of like a forum chat experience - something you do just for fun and stop when you wanna do something else. Except of course with more energy and dedication because that's what programming requires. Could be game related, but could also just be library code, or an application.

Java is my day job, so I'm far from being a beginner (but wouldn't call myself a pro). I haven't published anything privately yet. I'm very active (on and off, though) in the Java subreddits and this one. I don't mind if the other person is not very proficient as long as the outcome is two people programming on one project, not one learning and the other tutoring or something. I'm active from 4 AM to 18 PM [Zulu Time](http://www.zulutime.net/) on weekends, or 16-18 PM during the week. 




 The **[screenshot](http://imgur.com/G6FXU4S)** shows the rotation center under the mouse pointer. The smaller circle shows the rotation angle: It's at about 180.

Obviously, the position of the rotation center affects the effective position of the object even though its internal coordinates stay the same. But the user must be able to drag the rotation center *without* the object moving in a logically correct but usability-wise completely insane way: The object must stand still.

For that, I would need to translate the left-top corner coordinate of the object (which is at the right bottom in the screenshot) as the rotation center is dragged.

Could you please give me a tip (that does not involve matrices because they are completely cryptic to me)? I already toyed around with multiplying the drag-delta with the sin/-cos of the angle\*Tau in various combinations, even multiplied the angle (A value from 0 to 1 for convenience.) with it in a way that the closer to 0 the angle is, the less this adjustment takes place. I can't find the right way.

EDIT:

Found a few values through experimenting. Still pondering, though.

    for angle 0 (0)
    x stays the same (so, x changes to x + rotXDelta - rotXDelta)
    y stays the same (so, y changes to y + rotYDelta - rotYDelta)

    for angle 0.25 (90)
    x changes to x + rotXDelta - rotYDelta
    y changes to y + rotYDelta + rotXDelta

    for angle 0.5 (180)
    x changes to x + rotXDelta * 2 (so, x changes to x + rotXDelta + rotXDelta)
    y changes to y + rotYDelta * 2 (so, y changes to y + rotYDelta + rotYDelta)

    for angle 0.75 (270)
    x changes to x + rotXDelta + rotYDelta
    y changes to y + rotYDelta - rotXDelta 

    (rotXDelta and rotYDelta are the relative movement of the rotation center.)

I think I see now ...

The trick is to achieve for 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 the following:

    ... - rotXDelta
    ... - rotYDelta

    ... - rotYDelta
    ... + rotXDelta

    ... + rotXDelta
    ... + rotYDelta

    ... + rotYDelta
    ... - rotXDelta 

Or rather:

    ... + rotXDelta*-1 + rotYDelta*0
    ... + rotYDelta*-1 + rotXDelta*0

    ... + rotXDelta*0 + rotYDelta*-1
    ... + rotYDelta*0 + rotXDelta*1

    ... + rotXDelta*1 + rotYDelta*0
    ... + rotYDelta*1 + rotXDelta*0

    ... + rotXDelta*0 + rotYDelta*1
    ... + rotYDelta*0 + rotXDelta*-1

Sounds like a job for Mister (co)sinus.

----

Ok, found the working Java code. But I think posting this helped me find the solution.

    final double rotCos = -Math.cos(rotAngle * MathUtils.Tau);
    final double rotSin = Math.sin(rotAngle * MathUtils.Tau);
    x += rotXDelta + rotXDelta * rotCos + rotYDelta * -rotSin;
    y += rotYDelta + rotYDelta * rotCos + rotXDelta * rotSin;

The object now visually stays in the same place when I drag the rotation center, no matter what the rotation angle is.

Thanks for trying to help / reading. 




 Voice on the phone says: "Press 1 for tech support. Press 2 for ..." - Show this on the display right away! Use "modem"-sounds to transmit info.

This could be a life saver in urgent cases, and certainly improves usability *a lot* since you don't have to remember anything and are also under much less time pressure.

It seems like a no-brainer to implement this, now that phones usually have displays. A proper standard should be developed, so that even info like "2m 14s estimated waiting time left" could be shown *and count down* (so the phone would have to *understand* the info instead of just throwing text and standard-icons onto the screen).

Since the info to be transmitted is so little, this should be doable even in the face of voice-optimizied audio compression.

Had this idea a few years back. I don't care what happens to it, so take it or leave it. Just thought I'd put it out there.

This could become a billion dollar thing! 




 The more pairs you have, the easier the problem arises. For identical pairs, you don't want to wear an old sock with a new one. For others, you might have very similar patterns that you only later realize were different (when it's too late).

As a joke, but also with some use factor, I think it would be a good product idea to have socks with an identical [QR-code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code) on both socks that contains a [UUID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) (Globally unique ID.) whose value the sock-user can compare. There could also be an app that explicitly allows to scan both and compares if they are identical. Might also have additional features like a personal database of socks that have no partner - it might eventually show up, identified by the UUID.

It's of course a problem to produce each pair with an individual code, but I bet that this isn't a hard problem any more today.

Had this idea this morning. I don't care what happens to it, so take it or leave it. Just thought I'd put it out there. 




 Observing over time that this subreddit does not deserve me, I retract my informative post text. Thy will be done, that's how I roll. Of course, people, being insane as they are, object to *that*, too. 




 **PREFACE**

The concepts in this text might be interesting especially to beginner gamedevs or people who [prefer to] work alone. They might have an enabling/motivating "I can do that!" experience because of the huge potential and ease of implementation. The language I work with (Java) is not important to the concepts, and very little of the text is about implementation, anyway.

If you aim to create Steam-level games, or (sadly) have some kind of subconscious clipper that makes you assume that only stuff that can sell in the PlayStation store is even worth thinking about, then save time and read no further. But if you have a text-adventure-ish mind-openness, you might find some great food for thought. Be warned, it's a lot of text (Sorry. But I'm writing this *for you*, I'd rather continue coming up with new shit, typing in my FreeMind document.), and you'll walk away *not knowing* what it really is if you haven't at least skimmed the whole thing.

I have been pondering concepts closely related to what the headline says for *months* in a row now, so I find the currently emerging concept all this seems to converge in worthy of sharing / discussing.

Key aspects that emerged as attractors during my ponderings of this year:

* Should be very easy to implement, so that as little as possible stands between my story-/game-idea musings and a working game.

* Should mainly build on the fantasy of the player, because I wouldn't be able to pull off (nor be willing to "waste" too much time on) adequate graphics. Those would also "bake" too much into place (e.g. the interface) - I am trying to stay flexible because I have been changing course *a lot*.

* Should allow complex object interactions with many different kinds of objects.

* Should allow spatial gameplay (e.g. to move around stealthily, to hide, to stay out of view), because I kept having a strong Deus Ex 1 and "escape from pursuers" vibe and like the idea of breaking into people's homes for loot.

I believe I have found a great answer to these demands:

----

**OBJECT SYSTEM**

All my recent prototypes converged into one underlying system that I have hence put into a library: A container based object system (CBOS). At its core, it's just an object class that has a container and an inventory list, which allows arbitrarily complex object trees: a ring in a box in a drawer in a desk in a room in a sector (e.g. "apartment" in a multi-apartment house) on a floor in a house on a plot of land (e.g. police hq having main building and generator building) etc.. Building such a tree is easy: You create the desk instance, the room instance, then call "setContainer(room)" on the desk. (If there's an object that's contained by the desk, it will, too, now be (indirectly) in the room. Perfectly straightforward.) Btw., I used soft references (Object IDs, a simple long counter.) so that during loading a savegame non-existing objects are not a problem. For the same reason, I put various HashMaps into the object so that I don't have to save/load individual variables but can just bulk it all. Once you have this, you can do an awesome amount of things, so I heartily recommend this concept.

**WHAT CAN EASILY BE DONE WITH IT**

I made console-based prototypes with this where you could select from a list of local objects (e.g. bathroom door), which lets the door add its interactions to the mainloop's list of default actions. You could open and close doors, or water valves, to any degree you wanted, the outlet would generate water substance objects that are collated to one substance object (if their respective container was the same, I mean) by a special call in the main loop. The smell of dampness would spread through the apartment, relative to the openness of doors. (In a different prototype,) The player was a complex object tree of body parts. To eat something, you would put an object into your mouth - think about this. "Duh." right? Except all games would have an "eat" verb that is *fake*, a make-believe facade for the players that they might not recognize as such, just as a reader might not recognize bad typography, but the impact on the brain / experience happens anyway, so maybe it's a good idea to try to not just make things *seem* real but to kinda *make them real*.

Here's one of these CBOS-prototypes:

**THE CONCEPT THIS POST IS ABOUT**

----

**SPATIALITY**

For spatiality, I had pondered all angles (abstract and tangible), but I ultimately settled for tiles. With a few radical twists, though:

1) I don't waste time on creating tile graphics or a tile graphics engine (e.g. defining which image rectangle is what object), instead I use *text-based tiles*. The screen background is white. Nothing-tiles (e.g. outside building on a floor above ground) are black, wall-tiles are dark gray, door tiles dark desaturated brown. The colors are strictly symbolic. Object tiles that you can enter (bed, toilet, shower stall) are bright gray and simply have a text written in them, saying what the tiles are (e.g. "bed"). Same for tiles you can't enter (office desk, washbasin), except the gray is darker. I tried to only have texts, but that was just confusing. This, however, is a golden middleground. You can even add details like "damaged" in a second line, even a bargraph that expresses the amount of damage - destructible walls or at least doors. The player ("YOU") would have the same bright gray as "enterable" object tiles, for the association. Or the player could have a couple of horizontal bar graphs in that color, expressing the current state of their most important stats.

**Photoshop mockups: http://imgur.com/a/0V1pm**

2) The tiles do not represent a precise size: They are only for the player's coarse spatial association. A bed is as big as a toilet or the player. Big bonus: You don't have to ponder the problem of multi-tile objects. I figure they measure from 0.5 to 3 meters, which sounds worse than it is. I invested a lot of thought in all this and wrote many kilobytes of notes, arriving at a system that would work as a whole. **Just look at the images and remember that you set out to play a *text adventure*.** But at the same time, you can use this spatiality to even implement the throwing or shooting of objects. This can even happen in the form of realtime action instead of turn-based gameplay.

Realize that you are looking at squiggly lines, fly droppings, circles - also known as "text". "You get used to it, though. Your brain does the translating. I don't even see the code. All I see is blonde, brunette, redhead." *The same would happen for the text tile system!* Except that the meanings that it can transport are very hard to transport via text, and/or it would take a lot of text / effort on the side of the player.

So, difference to classical text adventure: You don't say "go north" to visit the next location. Nor are locations here just one place were there's a desk, a bed, and two doors. If you are in a small bathroom, you see a small bathroom; if you're in a hangar, it will take you time to get from one end to the next, so the game could even feature view distance, especially for potential foes (guards etc.), and you can also have the traditional rotating camera you have to avoid. But how is this still a text adventure? Well, read on.

**INTERFACE / OBJECT INTERACTION**

The example uses 128x128 pixels per tile. The intention is to have the tile "map" occupy the whole screen. However! There should be a *very slight* movie letterbox effect: A thin black bar at the top and bottom, maybe separated with a thin line from the step-scrolling map. At the top, you have the "breadcrumbs" of the object tree, and the game clock. At the bottom, you have the list of current realtime interaction controls. More about that *key stuff* later.

You press the right mouse button to pause the game (if it's the realtime variant) and to get a mouse pointer, which is otherwise hidden, cause it's useless while you WASD around in the world. When you hover over a map tile with the mouse pointer, a description (If any.) is shown at the opposite side of the screen, e.g. "The office desk is old and sturdy, made from massive oak wood.", but what's also shown is a list of contained objects, e.g. "desktop", "left drawer", "right drawer". These are just CBOS-objects whose container is the desk. They might have "joint" information like "mounted" (drawer) or "isPartOf" (desktop), not shown to the player but relevant to potential interactions you might come up with later. The object list and description change/vanish depending on where you hover. When you click the right mouse button again, you're back in the (realtime) game. But if you click the left mouse button, the hover-effect is frozen, so you can now move the mouse to the object list (List and description would now be at a fixed position, e.g. always the left top of the screen). When you hover over objects, a second description text and object list is shown next to the first one, showing e.g. the "desktop" description and the objects placed there. Again you'd have to left-click to freeze the hovering. The first description/text would vanish, the second would be moved into its place. So, you could repeat this concept arbitrarily deep.

The actual object interaction, however, does not take place via mouse. The mouse only serves to navigate the object tree, it represents a mental act the player avatar would execute: It's equivalent to the "examine" command in text adventures. To actually flush the toilet, gradually open/close the door or a water valve, you use keyboard keys. Which ones? The ones that are shown at the bottom of the screen in the reserved black letterbox-layout bar. They are already shown while you hover with the mouse, so you immediately see what objects you can interact with, something the player will probably appreciate a lot. So, in addition to the standard keys (WASD and whatever else there will be), you get object-relative interaction keys. Optionally, the standard keys could be displayed at the bottom, too, but only while in the game, not in hover mode. Tutorial feature half solved.

Breadcrumbs: What selecting an object with the left mouse button did was not just to freeze the hover-effect but also to "focus" the avatar attention on it (See realtime interaction keys.), so it's a good interface metaphor. The object hierarchy path to the object will be added to the breadcrumbs at the top of the screen:

New York  Hell's Kitchen  'Ton Hotel  Paul's apartment  [Livingroom]  compartment behind painting  keypad

The rectangular brackets surround the location the player is in. (There might be some redundancy involved. The 3D array for the tiles is a building, hence plot of land, city etc. is practically defined for each tile, but to express which tile is in which "sector" or "room", a parallel CBOS tree would be required.) The kicker is that while in mouse mode, you can also hover over the individual breadcrumb elements, getting the description and, if not "left" of your own location, also contained objects. Same rules apply: Left clicking focuses on the object. So, you can easily browse the tree backwards, e.g. from "ring in box in drawer in desk in room" straight back to the room, or to the desk.

Game clock: If you hover over the date and time shown at the right top, you see a log of story steps you have already taken, incl. the time when this happend. From time to time, this list might be interrupted by short synopses. At the bottom, there would be a summary of the story opener text. At the top, you see the a summary of the current story state (e.g. "The League of Overzealous Medical Scientists (LOMS) has found out about you. You figure that it would be better to avoid being captured by them.").

Player avatar inventory: The avatar could itself be a complex object system, so that you could e.g. put an object into your mouth, or affix a backback to your back. In any case, the containers you have (Or just the one inventory.) could simultaneously be weight- and volume-based. The objects would be available via the mouse hover system (and maybe also a shortcut mechanic), so to give some kind of realism to them, a simple weight and volume (In liters.) value could go a long way. Can't fit the keyboard into a jeans pocket. Can't hold object x in hand because player strength is still too low. Capacity and usage could be shown by bargraphs or a percentage, which would be realistic.

**STEALTH**

Well, if you want to make it simple yet still interesting, just add a "hide" interaction for the photocopier, the bed, etc., plus some variables depending on the object, e.g. when hidden under table, you're less visible *the closer* the guard is because of the vertical angle, but you're safer "behind" the photocopier the further away the guard is. Otherwise, use a cone of vision and a visual obstruction simulation based on the tiles.

**NPCs**

Yeah. Still thinking about that one. But [A\*](http://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html), some intentions, some preferences as to the situation ("This door should not be open!") etc., are easy to do, nothing revolutionary.

**REALTIME ACTION**

Such a game would of course be ideal for a turn-based approach, but I personally like the realtime approach better, because you really experience how you e.g. are opening or closing a door by holding down your keys. Lockpicking would also be much more impacting if it were a realtime task. And what about holding down a key to pee? If you just program a pee action that takes 20 seconds (plus bladder fullness \* constant), how do you deal with a car outside that exploded 5 seconds into the action?

Since every CBOS object would get a simulate() call on every game step, some of which would actually do something (e.g. toilet tank refilling), a 30 or 60 FramesPerSecond gameloop is out of the question. Ok, you could just do a realtime thread with an actual move-from-tile-to-tile scroll effect plus a simulation thread, the latter only being called e.g. twice a second, but the goal was "as crappy as possible for quick implementation, while also as complex/enabling as possible". I think that a choice of 200 ms to 1000 ms per gamestep is reasonable. I personally opt rather for 200 so that possible bar graph changes while the player performs a realtime action are still reasonably animated. Also, there might be highly interactive actions like lockpicking that require a more fluent interface. Finally, there's moving/running: The higher the resolution, the more believable various speeds can be communicated, instead of having to resort to "dithering", multiple field moves etc.

----

**SUMMARY**

So, what is this? A very easy to implement template for text adventures with spatiality, where the concreteness of the tile-map does not cripple the fantasy of the player and is soon "read" like words in a text. Complex object interactions are possible, complex object trees (Why not even have a simulate call to the avatar's organ objects? Or select "bladder" object, "open valve" xD) What's possible is almost entirely up to the game designer. Invent to your heart's content.

 A tough nut to crack. But impossible?

The kind of text-adventure I have in mind is closer to a MultiUserDungeon than to InteractiveFiction (but will be single player): There will be lots of simulation, and the world (incl. the NPC and the player avatar) will be a container-based hierarchy, so you can find a ring in a box in a drawer in a desk in a room in an apartment in a floor in a house etc., and every object in the world will get a simulation call per gamestep (Gamestep size is 1 second, time progresses only if the player does something.)

I'm basically trying to implement "Thief"- or "Deus Ex 1"-like gameplay but via the open-to-your-fantasy approach that the abstract (read: non-spatial) world structure and description offers. Not 3D and not 2D but text - this also allows much deeper simulation. And many things that DX1 offers, I can make happen.

But even though I have been thinking about the spatial-gameplay-problem for quite a few hours (not just now but also months back), I can not find the solution for scenarios like these:

* Distance measuring e.g. for aiming/shooting or view checks: How could the player be at one end of a corridor, and a guard enters the corridor at the other end, too far to be dangerous, but the player needs to do something about it? In a room-based approach, the guard and the player would be in the same room, period. I thought about maybe secretly separating larger rooms into several, but 1) the inconsistencies that would inevitably occur (This room 2 sections, that room 5, and the section size is even different.) plus the fact that I would have to design *a lot* more (though some aiding procedures might nullify this concern) speak against this. Another candidate: To denote locations of objects by units of length, but this would open a whole can of worms.

* How could the player hide *behind* a person in a room? Normally in a text adventure, you either see what's "here", or you don't. There's no viewing direction, and no relative position (not to my knowledge).

* How could the player secretly move past a (maybe constantly turning) camera, maybe behind obstructions like a desk? Of course, there could be a specific "hide behind obstruction" feature for candidate objects, but the term "behind" is a problem here, what if the object is next to a wall and any "behind" is still in view? And what if the camera has moved on and so could you - is the next spot or the path to it clear?

I already solved ladders and the stacking of boxes, but these other quite essential things just don't want to fit the format.

Is there really no way?

Different view, same topic:

In DX1, at the end of the training, there's a demo scenario in a large hall that is split along its long axis by a river-like pool. On your river bank, a battle robot patrols. You have to get to the far end of the hall and to the other side of the river. This can be solved relatively easily because the location and the movement of the robot are almost 1-dimensional, so indeed units of length could be used to make this happen. But this is an exceptional situation. Or are there specific (but different) solutions like this possible for considerably different 3D stealth-action game like situations?

 EDIT: Made a repository on BitBucket.

https://bitbucket.org/train_subject9394/simpleskillbasedhacknslash

The current build is almost perfectly identical to the one from August.

It's **Java 7** by the way.

----

I had this idea at some point this night and spent the whole day implementing it, and it works quite nicely. It's a very simple turn-based hack slash to demonstrate the game mechanic.

Java console game: http://speedy.sh/EbmY4/SSBHNS-2014-08-24.jar (13.8 KB. Start in console with 'java.exe -jar "SSBHNS-2014-08-24.jar"')

Source code: http://pastebin.com/7d1CaMtr (So you don't have to trust someone's executable.)

I chose a bracket-counting approach: The player sees a String like ",!.[]|].." (Depending on the foe, its current life points, and the progress-dependent difficulty.) for about a second, then the player is asked to enter a number, which in the example case would have to be -1. The closer to the correct value, the greater the success when attacking or defending.

This can even express the nature and kind of foe, how high or low the foe's health is, and even if the player is currently irritated: In the demo, if you suffer a critical hit (A hit that takes more than 1/4 of your current health.), you are dizzy for a whole round, and then the cryptic string is not shown as consecutive characters, instead it is randomly spread over several lines.

Since I had to playtest this thing a lot today for balancing, I can say that it is an interesting and working approach, that it is somewhat fun, and that e.g. the dizzy-effect does just what you'd expect it to.

 [author] I also posted in GIMP subreddit, but probably /r/gamedev is a good idea too. Thanks for suggestion.

That was 1 day ago, and you guys are *still* missing out. So here it is. 




 I'm making a text adventure game and am currently working on a television object. There will be a few channels. Just because it's so easy, I thought to put in a Bible channel where random excerpts are read to the audience. Same for Quran, was equally easy.

I would like to add a skeptic/atheist channel, too, but couldn't find a nice long text as material for this.

Do you guys have any suggestions?

(While we're at it: Any suggestions for other channels?)

 You play an NPC in someone's video game. You observe that the player is in a fight and loses. The guy in front of the screen, about whom you don't know at all, loads a savegame, so everything is reset to an earlier situation.

For some reason, you become aware of this.

(The cause for reload needn't be the player losing in a fight, but it should be something that is understandable, or it would be weird / bad for this game if there's suddenly a reset for no apparent reason.)

This could lead to all kinds of game ideas. For example:

----

A "new game +" based game, conceptually like [Rogue Legacy](http://store.steampowered.com/app/241600/), where you keep your NPC stats while the whole world around you resets every time the player loses. This could e.g. be used in the following way: You lose accumulated values in between new levels, but each full level you achieve stays with you. Levels could be individual per stat, so you'd have decimal values that slowly rise, and once the next whole number is reached, that number stays. Items could get lost on every reset, if you can adapt the means by which you obtain items depending on what your stats are like, e.g. if you're strong, go to a better (but more dangerous) source.

But the game reset could also have *advantages* of some sort for you. One of which could be that everybody loses their stats while you stay strong and can hence reign supreme. Because of this (or another such reason), it could be in your interest to *help* the player survive longer, but on other occasions you might be interested that the game gets reset.

----

Alternatively:

The fact that you become aware of this gives you profound insight. Is reality only a simulation, or what's going on here? This could lead to all kinds of story/gameplay, in the most extreme even to you somehow being able to gather/design/assemble parts for / via a 3D printer, so that you could become an entity in the *real* world there the player also exist. In the less extreme variant you'd explore the digital reality in the computer beyond the game. Even less extreme, you'd roam freely in the game, gathering more and more knowledge, hence being able to become the ruler of that world, or even obtain god-like powers.

Btw., the way in which you become aware of the situation could be that you increasingly (= less transparently) see your locations in previous runs on the screen, kinda like some racing games show your previous laps by drawing your car in transparent several times simultaneously in different places.

Maybe the closer you get to such a location, the more visible it becomes, so the first few runs would be about you having to kinda "increase the glow" until it reaches a certain level, and then some magic badaboom screen effect takes place and you are henceforth freed from this cycle of resetting things, so you can move around freely even though there was a reset, or you henceforth keep your stats, or whatever.

----

This idea was inspired by the loosely related post "[Not a well thought out game idea: Henchman](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedesign/comments/2cjoeb/not_a_well_thought_out_game_idea_henchman/)" in /r/gamedesign. 




 To get a feel for how this should go, think of the situation in the zoo where Harry accidentally makes the glass of the boa constrictor cage disappear.

http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone CTRL+f "zoo"

The movie/story would just depict part of HP's young life without a distinct story arc behind it, the focus would instead be on what the title says: Situations, and human emotions (kind of the opposite of Hollywoods usual way of dealing with a superhero discovering their powers, which usually rather is like "Umm, ok. What's for breakfast?").

PS - If you find the title to be a little long: I copied it from my old post to /r/OneLineMoviePitch :] 




 Repost of a [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingPrompts/comments/26a8eg/create_a_text_adventure_with_simulation/) I made 2 months ago in /r/ProgrammingPrompts ("1,535 readers") - please also check the comments section there for more inspiring ideas/thoughts.

----

----

Interactive text-based stories, where the magic happens in the head - not new. But I haven't seen one with a simulated world in the background yet.

This idea is for beginners and pros alike - just pick your level of complexity.

----

Example: "You are in a kitchen. You see a stove, a fridge, a ceiling lamp, a switch, and a sink. There is an open door to the north, a closed window to the west."

The objects in the room have properties, the room itself has an environmental situation (e.g. air pressure, smells, temperature), the player also has properties (e.g. when the light is low or the player is blind-folded, the data retrieved via the eyes is limited/removed, so the text is changed accordingly, all by procedure instead of manually typed!).

On every game turn, simulate(); is called on all existing objects in the game world. So, when you return to room X, the fruits in the bowl on the table might have become a little less fresh.

----

Some ideas:

* The game could either be turn-based, like the classic ones, or it could be in real-time in 1-second-steps, and as soon as the player starts typing, the game is paused until the input line is empty again. Alternatively, the whole input could happen via dropdown-menus: The moment a menu is opened, the game is paused. I attempted this a little, works very well - there was an "exits" menu, a "you" menu, and an "objects" menu.

* Simple "sound rendering": Sounds could be muffled or too silent to identify. One sound could be "drowned out" by another one, so that you e.g. have to turn off a washing machine to be able to hear/identify the person imprisoned behind the secret wall. One way to do this, for example, could be to describe the sounds a bit to the machine. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_frequency is an interesting resource for this. Based on it, one could describe with a boolean or double the significancy and volume of 4 or 5 frequency sections of the sound in question. This would allow to calculate how much a sound might be overridden by another one, to determine if it should be described to the player clearly, in a very coarse way that could be interpreted freely, or if the sound isn't described at all.

* Simple "light rendering" - or should I call it "em radiation rendering"? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum Nuclear terrorism, here we come! (Hi FBI.)

* Player and other beings could have rather complex and simulated stats, e.g. body temperature, hunger, weight, height, stance (Can you see the police car outside through the window while being bound on the floor?)

* Talking about police: NPCs could gather information (with some Garbage Collection to prevent data overkill), so if you drive your van to the city park and abduct someone, the police might be able to browse the tree of available options/objects to pick up an informational trace and ultimately get to you. I know, totally insane, but I believe it's not impossible. On the other hand, during your next game, you might play a cop yourself! An open self-experience system?

* Once you have a working system with rooms and some objects, start writing a world generator so that you have fun exploring your simulation while you're writing it. Tests will probably be pretty inspiring for the overall project.

----

Suggestions:

* After a few attempts, I have figured out that the object model should use soft links, meaning that the objects should refer to each other via an ID number (e.g. 64 bit long), because ultimately you will face the beast that saving/loading is, and loading while related objects don't exist yet is a pain. Better just use soft links and look everything up in a manager class that also does the loading/saving.

* Every object (hence the master class from which all object classes inherit) should have an inventory. You could add flags and checks for/against the player/simulation using it, but it's good if it exists. E.g. put an object into your mouth. Or define buildings by "house contains floors which contain apartments which contain rooms" etc.

* Additionally, each object might have a variable list (in Java, it would probably be a HashMapString, Object), because that's again much easier to save/load than creating extra variables in each object and then having to deal with those.

* If you want to make a toilet (or whatever other kind of world object), my attempts have shown that it's best to create a separate class for every kind of object instead of trying to build the omni-object.

* Go crazy! E.g. in my realtime-attempt (Java) where input happened via dropdown menu, I made a toilet where you can lift/lower the lid and the seat (each pushing each other), you can flush, and you can abort the flushing which means that the next flush works right away but is shorter (the tank refills in realtime, the rest is logical - See the beauty of simulation versus just writing the story?). It's easy and fun to write world-objects like these, and they are easy to extend: Say, the toilet does not refill if the incoming water pipe is turned off. Of course you still have a free flush. Alternatively, you might be imprisoned and might need water. Hard choices have to be made, especially if you also simulate bowel movements.

* Again, go crazy: It's a *text adventure* system! Well, you can't just make up *anything*, because you have to give it some reality via simulation, but otherwise: Sky's the limit! Processing time is not an issue. Why shouldn't a turn take a few seconds? Do all the things you wished were in your favorite 3D action adventure game, but they didn't put it in because of development constraints, marketing, or simply because everything at once can't be done on today's PCs. But I double-dare you: DON'T fuck up the FoV! 




 I've read r/atheism's [guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/wiki/guidelines), the [rules of reddit](http://www.reddit.com/rules), and the [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) before making this post. Please don't let this honest effort to ensure a proper post go to waste by dismissing this at trolling, please allow others to find this.

I believe to be God, and that this is the beginning of the apocalypse, but I am not sure. Our interactions should leave you with a change in your personal life's flow (events, feelings, thoughts, the need to cough, deep-penetration-associations, ...) that you can detect/decipher in the next weeks, *starting* today (but today you'd really need a microscope). So, why not wait before posting? Because I want to get this show on the road already. The faster it happens, the earlier the dying of about 153,000 humans per day (worldwide) ends.

Ask me anything, e.g. about the creation of the world (which I completed about 13 years ago :) or how I plan to govern the future of mankind. These interactions should trigger the effects, should leave me with valuable data regarding the state of things, and should definitely accelerate things a wee bit. 




 In my near 2 years of Java, I have often come across this problem, so overall I can say that it took me *days* to find this solution (which ultimately I found [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9180408/how-to-use-jscrollpane-within-the-center-of-a-borderlayout)). I always evaded the problem with a different approach so far.

An example:

I have a JLabel with multi-line text (made possible by wrapping it in HTML/BODY tags). I added that to a JScrollPane. I added the pane to a JPanel in BorderLayout.CENTER.

This was unsatisfactory, the available space was not used. Only when the content grew large enough, the pane used all space and showed the scrollbar. Adding the pane to NORTH instead seemed to work - but once the content was large enough, the NORTH section would just start to eat up the rest of the vertical space (e.g. the SOUTH part would be squished).

The solution is simple (once you know it):

I put the JLabel into a new JPanel whose layout is FlowLayout (alignment left), then made the JScrollPane with the JPanel instead of with the JLabel. Done. Good night.

This took way too long. 




 Most games today have broken volume sliders: Between full volume and, say, 60%, you hear almost no difference. The programmers just blindly applied the 0to1 factor and moved on. Please don't make the same mistake when it's 1) so obvious and 2) so easy to fix.

Short and to the point volume slider problem info:

http://www.dr-lex.be/info-stuff/volumecontrols.html

Some formula suggestion for the problem:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1165026/what-algorithms-could-i-use-for-audio-volume-level

----

Let's say you have walk sounds for grass, stone, gravel. Instead of doing a hard switch between them, you could play two simultaneously with different volumes resulting, as a sum, in full volume (and please regard the above topic, it applies here, too). If your map even has mixed ground or soft transitions, that would fit perfectly.

In a Thief-like game, you could mix the various footstep sounds according to walk speed.

But that's only a very primitive way to benefit from this cheap "additive synthesis" approach.

What if you want to express that a sound is playing inside a container / behind a wall in another room? You could use a low pass filter to muffle the higher frequencies. But if you don't want to get that sophisticated or want to work with e.g. vanilla Java, you could just prepare the original, slightly filtered, strongly filtered sound and then play them mixed according to situation.

You could even record spittle and gargle sounds and overlay them over speech samples at various volumes according to the degree of illness or the degree of blood-in-the-mouth or degree of zombie-transformation.

Car engine sound could be recorded as a smooth, round variant and as one where you can hear the nailing of the cylinders.

etc. 




 You've probably come across the Runnable interface in the form of

    SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable(){
        @Override
        public void run() {
            // Swing stuff. All of it needs to be executed on the AWT Event Dispatcher thread, that's what you use invokeLater for.
            // Btw, you can also use this construct while you're already on the AWT thread:
            // The commands in this block will be executed once the AWT thread is done with *everything* else,
            // so if you need to work with the completely updated UI (e.g. size of components
            // after a revalidate() call), you can make use of this construct.
        }
    });

The concept behind the Runnable interface is mighty awesome really: You can give one of your methods an arbitrary code block to execute! Remember how it was without Runnable, when you had to give a method e.g. an int and then create an if or switch block which would decide what method to call? With Runnable, you can just hand the code to be executed to the method directly - and other stuff.

You could for example use a setter in a class: "setCodeForShutdown(myRunnable);" And when that class is shutting down the program, you can have it execute that code first. Or you could create a HashMapString, Runnable() and use a Scanner(System.in) to type commands and have them execute with two more lines of code.

Of course you can create your own interfaces that use the same concept, because Runnable is not special at all - it's just employed by the Java libraries in so many places that it has a special status. Your interface could e.g. have two run()-like methods, one for normal execution and one for a special situation.

----

But what really kicks the Runnable interface concept through the roof is when you use Java 8. Consider this code:

    final public class MyApp {

        final public static void main(final String[] args) {
            SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable(){
                @Override
                public void run() {
                    startUI();
                }
            });
        }

        final private static void startUI() {
            // create, initialize, and show JFrame
        }
    }

In Java 8, you can write the call in this shorter form (this is the famous **Lambda**):

    final public static void main(final String[] args) {
        SwingUtilities.invokeLater(() - {
            startUI();
        });
    }

But since the run() method body is only one command, you can even write it shorter:

    final public static void main(final String[] args) {
        SwingUtilities.invokeLater(() - startUI());
    }

If you think "Ok, I knew all that.", what about this then:

    final public static void main(final String[] args) {
        SwingUtilities.invokeLater(MyApp::startUI);
    }

This is another novelty of Java 8 - a **method reference**. You can use it entirely as a replacement in your Runnable (and similar - more about that later) situations, for example:

    final Runnable r = MyApp::startUI;
    r.run();

This works and behaves as intended! Remember that startUI is not in any way special - it's not a class or anything, it's just a plain old method. Before Java 8, you would *have* to declare a class (e.g. an anonymous class) to do such a thing.

An example for the instance of a class:

    final MyClass myClass = new MyClass();
    final Runnable r = myClass::myNonstaticMethod; // you can even use "this::myMethod"
    r.run();

Now, finally, an example that does not use Runnable:

    private static interface PaintMethod {
        void paint(final Graphics2D g, final MapEntry mapEntry);
    }

    final private static void paintSomething(final Graphics2D g, final MapEntry mapEntry) {
    }

With this prepared, we can now do this in a method:

    final PaintMethod pm = MyClass::paintSomething;
    pm.paint(g, me);

See? You can also use method references like this for methods with parameters. The Runnable interface is not special.

----

If you want to code in Java 8, to my experience (Which might be wrong.), you need IntelliJ at this point, because Eclipse does not yet seem fully ready for Java 8. The downside is that in IntelliJ you would have to choose the "javac" compiler instead of the "Eclipse" compiler (because the latter only works up to Java 7 at the moment), and the "javac" needs an error free project while the "Eclipse" compiler can compile anything just fine as long as the methods called are error free. Btw: The Community Edition of IntelliJ is free and fully allows to create commercial software. I used Eclipse for 1 year, then tried IntelliJ and am happy that I did so. But you can switch back to Eclipse at any point, it's not like IntelliJ swallows your project and doesn't give them back any more, it even has an exporter for Eclipse, but you can just work on your Eclipse project with IntelliJ for a few minutes, then close it and continue in Eclipse without need for an export.

(I used two horizontal for each one vertical just because of the font proportions.)

There will be a 3D array of rooms. Each room can have 6 possible walls. Obviously, rooms 0,0,0 and 1,0,0 share a wall slot.

I am looking for a good practical data structure to store this. I currently have two candidates, but they rub me the wrong way.

Candidate 1: A wasteful array.

    01234
    ... 
    | | | 

This would waste 9 entries for a map as scribbled at the top (which has 25 entries). On the room layer. If we imagine to denote the ceiling/floor layer of one story, even 21 of the 25 entries are wasted. And handling this array wouldn't be *that* easy, even though it seems simple enough at first. It's error-prone.

Candidate 2: Four arrays.

- the rooms XZY
- the walls along the leftright (X) axis, XZY
- the walls along the updown (Z) axis, XZY
- the walls along the vertical (Y) axis, XZY, also known as floors/ceilings

I assume that the bulkiness of the task when it comes to data structures is due to the nature of more than one dimension. (Most of the things I wrote would apply to the 2D version of this, too.)

I also consider a 3rd approach: A box-class that has 6 wall slots. But this one sucks, too: Two adjacent boxes would share walls, so it's *yet again* quite unhandy.

Any suggestions?

 I've been doing Java for over a year, and for String comparisons I often had to do .toUpperCase (or toLowerCase()). I can't believe I overlooked equalsIgnoreCase until now! Just saw it over at /r/javahelp. 




 I personally don't like it in applications when I have to wait for tooltips to appear (which is the default), and I absolutely despise it when they disappear before I have read them completely. The former is a question of taste, the latter is not. For my applications, I have set the tooltip delay to zero and the duration to about a month (which is max).

But they do get in the way because for some retarded reason, the Java team (which moved mountains and is awesome otherwise) decided that Java tooltips are not transparent to mouse events. When I was just now adding tooltips to dropdown menu entries, they just got *too much* in the way, and after two hours of fumbling, I found a simple and elegant solution:

Just set ToolTipManager enabled=false (which dismisses current tooltips) and immediately enabled=true for every mouse move event. Bonus effect: The tooltips move with the mouse pointer.

----

**EDIT:** Improved the appearance a bit. Java's ToolTip system is really improper: If your tooltips have to be pushed to the left because they reach the screen's right end, they show considerable flicker behavior. I have even had cases where they had just been plainly black. To reduce the flickering, I introduced a counter.

----

    final ToolTipManager toolTipManager = ToolTipManager.sharedInstance();
    final int flickerReduction = 10;

    toolTipManager.setInitialDelay(0);
    toolTipManager.setDismissDelay(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
    toolTipManager.setReshowDelay(0);

 An idea that keeps running through my head, so I have to get it out: Letting your in-game character walk/run by pressing one key for the left and for the right leg.

Press control for L: Left leg steps forward. Press R: Right leg. L: Left. ...

If you do this synchronous with the game, your character will just move with the speed you mirror with your inputs. If you do it faster, the character will pick up speed, the animation will smoothly change from relaxed walking to fast walking to running.

If you fall out of rhythm, the character will move slower or, if you totally fall out of it, will quickly reduce speed to walking and then standing still (but will probably jiggle a bit since you're still giving the legs commands to move).

A player could even assign the L key to CTRL left, the R key to CTRL right: When we walk and run in real life, we're moving our arms with this in rhythm. So inputting the action like this might even trigger our muscle memory and give a deeper experience.

This approach might ALSO be used to rotate your character to the left and right even, for advanced runners.

----

Another example: An adventure game like Monkey Island, but in 3D first person, which is not a new idea. But what if you hold down a key which will give you, while the key is pressed, a mouse pointer and a small menu next to all visible objects in reach listing the possible interactions. This would be an efficient and smooth way to solve the "narrow interface tunnel between reality and the game-reality" problem that hampers game experience. Just move around in the world, and whenever your will desires to interact, hold the key and see the possible interactions, move the mouse pointer, click. It would feel efficient and un-hindering. The mouse pointer could start in the center of the screen every time, except if the player hasn't changed the viewing direction / position much.

----

What ideas in this line of thinking (See headline.) do you have?

Sidebar-rules: I don't think that this violates submission rules, because this is just a way to discuss the topic, it doesn't ask for people to list games they like etc. - The idea is to come up with new interface ideas and possibly new game-play ideas along them.

I'm asking for possible new meaningful ways to interface with your in-game character or other aspects of the game world. Think "virtual reality", forget the decade and tons of games we have, don't be imprisoned in existing solutions. Take into account that the respective game's topic/game-play could be entirely different than existing ones - like e.g. Mirror's Edge. The game could well be designed around the mechanism you describe. 














 Follow-up question: Would this mean that in Germany, the sales are over at 19:00?

German article by the famous Heise company comparing the XBOX1 and PS4:

http://www.heise.de/meldung/Angetestet-Xbox-One-gegen-PS4-2052893.html

Forum claims that it's slightly biased towards PS4, but I can't tell.

Fun fact: It seems that both consoles are too loud to be used as music players. My PC is almost perfectly silent, so I just found an additional reason to be glad to be a member of the glorious PC master race.

EDIT: Additional info that I happen to stumble over.

 Games could just use hard-coded keys/buttons, and this input configuration library/interface would switch around everything before it even arrives at the game software. It should be an open library so that it's not bound to Steam. But Steam would be ideal, given that they already have their Steam overlay - I mean, it would be best if this universal input configuration system could be accessed without having to leave / Alt-Tab from the game.

So, again, in case it wasn't clear: In games, you can configure what keyboard or mouse button fulfills which function. But instead of implementing this anew again and again (at varying quality levels :P), why not just write this *once* and improve it gradually forever? The games would just provide info (e.g. via XML file) about what functions it provides, what properties those have (e.g. toggle, hold, ...) and what hard-coded input they would use.

This could even solve the Valve software pilot demand that I have: Several Valve games need exactly the same input configuration. Walk directions, jump, duck, the works. A pilot function would be great for this. Set up once, use everywhere. 




 I imagine that if we put a lens a few meters away from the laser, we can force the incoming photons to continue their "flight" in a perfectly parallel fashion (which would allow to project a millimeter-small speck on the Moon), just as we can arbitrarily modulate incoming photons that have traveled for billions of light years.

What's the catch?

full disclosure: I read these two very informative sources, but I still don't get it:

    Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

Put the above into a text file and call it "DX HR DC fov 120.reg". Run the file, and click OK like 25 times. That's it.

Whenever you visit the "Gameplay" options menu, the FoV will reset, so you have to run the file again.

78 is simply the hexadecimal version of the decimal number 120. Use e.g. the Windows calculator (Switch to programmer mode.) to get the value you want. Or use any of the billion online resources that supply this service.

I made myself 5 such files for easy switching, but I guess I'll stick to 120. Mine are 100 110 120 130 140 (64 6E 78 82 8C). You can use any value in between, it's not locked to an interval of 10.

I'm off now to finally play the damn game. 


































 I'm in the same boat with you: Religion, no thanks. Belief without evidence, no thanks. AtheistExperience: Hooray. (I listen to a few bits every morning/evening while playing Rogue Legacy and listening to SomaFM.com, recommended.)

This submission is supposed to be an experiment: I have reason to believe that I, umm, have a special relationship with reality, or rather: That reality (which you inhabit) has a special relationship with me. I'll detail this further down.

THE EXPERIMENT now is to see if you do experience hints of this special relationship when reading this text and interacting with me in the comments.

THE OBSERVATIONS should follow this pattern, but they should be very slight, not "fist in the face" miracles or something:

I can not become guilty. I am holy. Any accusation against me is wrong, and even makes the accuser guilty. Reality should somehow express this, e.g. by the person who has the mental attitude against me having to cough, dropping their coffee, getting an unpleasant call that pulls them back down to the ground from which they quite lifted off when letting their fantasy run wild etc.

I don't mean to offend, I mean to conduct an experiment AND further my agenda (assuming that the experiment will be a success).

Thanks for your participation. 




 I heard that BestBuy and GameStop offer gift cards that someone can redeem to add to their Steam Wallet.

Are there other such services?

Does Amazon.de offer such a service / sell something like that?

[I got an Amazon.de gift card, redeemed it, but never seem to find good game deals. So, I'd like to have it in my Steam Wallet instead.] 







































 The reason that I ask this rather non-gaming-related question here is because I want to sample the "general population". From what I have gathered over years, no one really knows/uses this function, and I find that super sad. Only once you have lived in the Hibernate universe for a while, you'll know that this would be true. Why it's not the default is beyond me: I have used it at home and in the office, on three different machines, in WinXP Win7 Win8, for years. No issues (except *very rarely* in WinXP, and nothing serious).

When I go shopping, I hit the physical power button of my PC and go. When I return, I hit it again and log in. Difference between before and after: NONE. Super comfortable. And the PC is really physically turned off, you can unplug it, carry it anywhere, resume. All windows will be where they were. [Multiple Desktops](http://code.google.com/p/mdesktop/) will be as they were. Steam continues its downloads. Videos continue playing. I can't imagine why someone wouldn't want this! I never tried it on games that only have a checkpoint system, though. They might not resume properly, but it's worth a try.

All aboard! But please tell me if you knew/used it.

If you have never heard of it: It's not super obscure, it's (As far as I have gathered.) just the diamond right in the middle of the table that for some reason nobody sees/uses.

 A reply to comments that are already there works, and hence the reply links should stay. But the main commenting box should go.

Example:

http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1j9bad/what_does_it_take_to_make_an_indie_game/

I searched before posting and saw Raldi's statement in [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/bhpkz/can_we_stop_deleted_posts_from_showing_up_in_the/) thread that such posts are not to show up in the first place and that they'll fix that bug. *That was three years ago.*

Also, what if the post is not yet deleted while it's in the list, but when I click it to see the comments it is?

The only solution is to make the commenting box disappear in those posts. 




 Haven't seen the ... historical documents yet, just a ~~tr~~ excerpt. It said that two people are required because the neuronal load for one human would be too big.

If I press a key on the keyboard, and it starts a program, or if instead a nuclear bomb is exploded, pressing the key is the same. The size of the effect is irrelevant. What am I missing?

EDIT: And what's with all the downvotes? 3 versus **11**, something's wrong here. 




 There's a post with no comments. People write a few and move on. The post is still at 1 total votes. It can be assumed that those people would want the post upvoted for the visibility of the post and of the comment.

So, why not automatically upvote the post if the user commented on root level?

The vote can still be changed freely, like always. But the user *can't forget* to upvote any more. Total freedom is retained. It's just for practicality.

 This sequence can be created with this algorithm:

[step 1] Initialize variables: u = 1; v = 0

[step 2] u = u - v; v = v + u

[step 3] go to [step 2]

Since you probably wonder why someone would ask this: I came up with that crap about 15 years ago when I was thinking about the universe and if there might be an algorithm to describe it. I thought that the most fundamental component of its system would probably somehow be wave-like, so I thought about the most simple algorithm to create a wave-like sequence. Since it's two variables played out against each other, it even has Yin Yang like qualities. Esoteric BS ends here.

I'm just curious if this could produce a proper sinus. 




 It is sadly a polished turd that I regret having paid 20 for, an assortment of the usual shooter clichs wrapped into high quality artsy visual design (though for some reason, all paintings have stucko texture, not paintbrush texture) - Dishonored is easily 10 times as good.

The sound design is remarkably bad, as everything sounds like it's squeezed through a brutal dynamic-compressor cranked up to 15, while additionally a set of high frequencies (I guess around 5 KHz) are boosted so much that it's just unpleasant and can only be beared by reducing the volume, and this is *not* to be confused with just being too loud.

The intro movies and too small FoV slider range can easily be fixed via settings-file-adjustment (for this and other tips, see [here](http://www.pcgamer.com/2013/03/27/bioshock-infinite-tweaks-let-you-skip-intro-videos-increase-fov-and-adjust-sensitivity/)), but be warned that the savegame system is *abysmal*, you only have far apart checkpoints between which you can easily have a lot of individual small activities (looking for the few kinds of existing goodies in trashcans etc.), and all those will be lost when you quit out of frustration to play something else, which can easily happen as you can easily miss such an autosave having happened.

Supposedly, this game is a descendant of System Shock and the much better System Shock 2, and while I see that they obviously took a few elements of those games, the game itself has nothing to do with those classics, it's a flat out lie to claim that it's actually a descendant, and if I purely use enjoyment as a measure, the game is at most worth 10 (rather 5, but the design, the sky-city, the pleasant companion experience, and most of all the curiosity as to how the story will continue (something the first play-through will kill) motivate a lot). 




 Seems like I can only play 1/3 of the game.

Apparently **game-breaking glitch on PC:**

You must find 6 fish. In every video I could find (all of which apparently XBOX), there are TWO fish on the ground near Gollum at the beginning of that level. You can pick both up. I have played the whole level 4 times now, but I only get 5 fish overall: There is only ONE on the ground near Gollum at the start.

One is right below the bowl where you have to toss the fish, the other would be a few meters to the right, still on the same screen. I do not have that fish. I can't finish the level. Couldn't find any info anywhere.

I heard that the XBOX version has seen updates but the PC version is still like on initial release.

Any tips/help?

I thought it might be interesting to you guys. 



















 [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/1et6lw/as_a_muslim_i_find_myself_becoming_intensely/) submission in r/Islam gave me the idea.

 for not being recognized by his creation - a creation that, by comparison to Allah, is insignificant, to say the least.

So, God's work is insignificant, he wasn't able (or willing) to create something worthy of his greatness? Or did he actually pull it off - meaning that God isn't *that* unimaginably infinitely high etc., but has a quite graspable greatness? 




 There was more which I currently can't remember. Admittedly, the interactive movie that it is (It's basically Dragon's Lair with freeroam-scenes, combat and some stealth.) is very well done, and it deserves praise - but this, in turn, shows how bad the state of gaming still is. We're lauding improvements, but we fail to laud the improvement separate from the rest (which still needs improvement).

The FieldOfView is much too low, it's *work* to even perceive the landscape around you. Oh, there's a fucking PLANE? Surprise. I didn't SEE it right there in the open. The interface to the computer (keyboard, mouse, controller, 2D video, audio) is narrow enough as it is. This warrants that measures that can be taken to improve the interface *should be taken*. Instead, the developers can't be bothered to increase a simple integer number from 50 up to 100 or something.

I just quit the game for the second time in frustration, in both cases it was a quicktime event that put me off. I'm not an anti-QTE nazi, I see that they can make sense in some places. In other places, I am still willing to put up with them even though I'd wish they weren't there. But in some places in this game, they are just an impossible hurdle.

Get this: *Interface issues.* That is a topic that I have an absolute gripe with. And a quicktime-event *is* an intentional interface obstacle, so it needs good justification to be there.

So, there's this wolf that attacks you once you got that stuff in the cave an hour or two into the game. Mash left right left right, then press F, then mash E. I keep doing this, just as they say, just when they say it. (What am I, doing *homework*? This is *tedious*, that's not a game for me.) But it doesn't work. I always get to see the wolf-eats-croft animation.

And what's with the scene immediately before you enter that cave? Just when you have climbed up the last wooden "This is intended to be climbed. We are developers giving you a clue. This is not a breach of the fourth wall, return to the circle-jerking fan herd, please."-thing, *three* things happen:

* The wolfs howl and growl, insinuating that you're on the same plane with them, that they'll attack you now, so you ready your bow and, through the forced binoculars, look around. It's kinda funny that preparing to shoot narrows the FoV even further, but just a slight bit - because it's already ridiculously low. Then, as a joke, you can press Y to zoom even more. But again, just a slight bit. Because the FoV had been too fucking low to begin with.

* Lara says something that you are to process with your mind.

* A text appears at the right bottom of the screen, saying something that I couldn't process.

All this *intentionally* happens at just this point, it's not a quirky situation caused by simulation. The developers *intended* this to happen this way. The developers are hence stupid.

And what's with the interface in general? When you are at a camp, you have a root menu from which you can click yourself deeper into the topics. But you can't use the mouse to return to the root - you have to use the ESC key a few times. Also, when you choose an ability to master, you get an extra menu level where you have to confirm. This does *not* happen when you improve your gear, even though the interface is otherwise entirely the same - bad interface design. Also, the interface is cleary intended to be flashy, rather not to be useful. This can e.g. be seen when you hover the mouse over the skill etc. that you hovered over before: The flashy change-over effect happens *again*, which is entirely unnecessary since you're already there.

There were more things, I didn't think of them now. But I feel that I have to work to get my money's worth of experience. If the game would have been cheaper, I could just dismiss it.

It's a waste. Like in so many other cases, where e.g. the FoV is just too fucking low. Why do they do this? The map/graphics/engine guys did great work in this game and many other games - and then some retard decides to break everything with poor interface and FoV choices. Those people should lose their job, and this should happen so often that they get the message.

I wish I hadn't bought this. Fuck the circle-jerk for pushing this into my life. I am looking at various sources when I purchase games, but they betrayed me this time.

(r/Gaming's reception was poor, also someone suggested that r/TrueGaming would be a better place for something like this.)

 (I'm not sure if this content is allowed.)

When Jesus resurrected, his body was taken from the tomb, insinuating that the flesh was re-used for the new manifestation. Maybe akin to what happened to Lazarus.

What happened to the blood that he lost? What happened to the cells/flesh that stuck to the torture instruments? Did this stuff vanish/reintegrate, too?

(Inspired by [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1dvkfa/the_power_of_christ/c9uq0wx?context=10).) 




 Title says it.

A person who believes that their child could *possibly* end up in *eternal torture, designed by the almighty*, is risking this by creating new life. How can a person make such a decision!?

Pascal's Wager. "The risk is so high that you have to submit your reasoning to it!" This is how it is being used against us. Well, it can be used against them, too, as shown. 














 It was always my take that logic itself becomes a singularity when we go back to the very first moment of time. Every datapoint we, or any human, observe can lead to an abstraction that kinda "contains" all these and other related datapoints. Many such abstractions can lead to another level of abstraction that in turn contains these abstractions (insinuating that any datapoint might be seen as an abstraction from some perspective). The "Theory of Everything" is an example for this, as it would unify General Relativity and Quantum Theory, so it would effectively contain them.

All in all, I conceptualize the world to be kind of like a 2D pyramid or a tree of logic that indeed has a root. Also, I think that this concept is applicable on every level, e.g. in everyday life, and should be taught in school, giving pupils a map of reality, so they could map out their "location" - everybody starts at the bottom and slowly climbs up with their mind. To e.g. be the President of the US, you have to have an understanding of the world that has climbed quite high up in the pyramid. This might even be the very effort that is invested into what we call "learning/understanding".

To me, it seems clear that there is a top-most point of the pyramid, which is the true meaning of the word "existence", and its discovery/definition is the holy grail of science.

But to me, it seems like this highest level can never be climbed, because all meaning fuses into one indivisible unity (Singularity.), maybe the name of it is "the truth". The Uncertainty Principle might even be the mathematical version of what I just said: It says "we know something is there, but we also know that we can't precisely know it".

The Uncertainty Principle might even state that GR and QT can not ever be united. In any case: At this point, science is beginning to pursue the functionality of logic/causality itself. This is entirely different territory than everything before.

What do you think? Does logic itself become a singularity at the very beginning of time - so, does all meaning melt into one indivisible thing there? And would this imply that certain high level concepts (e.g. GR and QT) can not possibly be united? 









 I found this old comment by user "RubberTrees" (which is quite insulting at times, but I'd ask you to overlook that for the sake of the argument, please) which makes this interesting point: The Bible does not give enough data to allow proper belief, even if you'd want to, because you're believing incorrectly/imprecisely.

I think we can assume that you will disagree with the point he/she makes.

**Why do you disagree with this point?** That's the reason for this submission.

 I just recently read it again from cover to cover. I took pretty extensive notes and painfully read each book.

 First of all it's really boring and hard to read. The stories are filled with disgusting examples of humanity at its worst and the god of the bible is blatantly evil.

 Some of the poetry is decent. I especially enjoyed Ecclesiastes and a few Proverbs but there is nothing in the bible that points towards a divine authorship. Nothing that even hints at omniscience. It is painfully obvious that it was written by, and for, ignorant men from an age of barbarism.

 The New testament is mainly a bunch of letters from Paul of Tarsus who never even met Jesus. Nothing in Matthew, Mark, Luke or John is very compelling at all.

 My biggest complaint is the "believe or burn" philosophy of the bible, which completely fucks everyone because the bible is insufficient for belief or knowledge of who Jesus even was.

**[START HERE]**

 Nothing in the Gospels really expresses or describes Jesus well enough where "belief in Jesus" would have any real meaning. For all the Christians know their mental image of Jesus (Yeshua) is so fucking far off base that if he is real their version doesn't even count and they still burn.

 "You've been picturing some white guy with a different name and his teachings weren't even translated correctly... fuck you, burn in hell." Yahweh (and this is completely within his character, he is insanely evil.)

 You can't just say some guys name (which isn't even his real name) picture some face (that isn't even his real face) and then read some of his words (that probably aren't even his words) and then expect some kind of reward. Especially when the god is Yahweh. (seriously, most evil creature ever created by man.)

 Christians have no fucking clue who Jesus was, what he looked like, what he was talking about or if the people who wrote the bible even described him properly. If the "believe or burn" philosophy is correct they should be freaking out because they have nothing to go on, no one does.

 If you have to believe in Jesus, there is simply no way to do it properly. You are most likely believing in some fictional idealized version of some guy you can't even picture correctly. If there is a tyrant god like Yahweh, and belief in his son is needed to avoid his wrath, everyone is fucked, even Christians. 




 I found this comment by him/her very enlightening and want to share it. More ammunition to shoot people reasonable is good. If impatient, start in the middle. (Text-post, so I'm not karma-whoring.)

 My biggest complaint is the "believe or burn" philosophy of the bible, which completely fucks everyone because the bible is insufficient for belief or knowledge of who Jesus even was.

 Nothing in the Gospels really expresses or describes Jesus well enough where "belief in Jesus" would have any real meaning. For all the Christians know their mental image of Jesus (Yeshua) is so fucking far off base that if he is real their version doesn't even count and they still burn.

 "You've been picturing some white guy with a different name and his teachings weren't even translated correctly... fuck you, burn in hell." Yahweh (and this is completely within his character, he is insanely evil.)

 You can't just say some guys name (which isn't even his real name) picture some face (that isn't even his real face) and then read some of his words (that probably aren't even his words) and then expect some kind of reward. Especially when the god is Yahweh. (seriously, most evil creature ever created by man.)

 Christians have no fucking clue who Jesus was, what he looked like, what he was talking about or if the people who wrote the bible even described him properly. If the "believe or burn" philosophy is correct they should be freaking out because they have nothing to go on, no one does.

 If you have to believe in Jesus, there is simply no way to do it properly. You are most likely believing in some fictional idealized version of some guy you can't even picture correctly. If there is a tyrant god like Yahweh, and belief in his son is needed to avoid his wrath, everyone is fucked, even Christians. 














 This posting serves to bring said concept to your attention, and to allow its discussion.

Assuming that mankind will keep progressing, maybe even populate other planets, so we'd have a much larger population:

I believe we can assume that eventually, high quality digital content of all kinds for very low prices or even for free will be available to people of all tastes, and even in such an amount that nobody will ever run out. (This will not prevent content creation, as creating is an entirely different game/experience than consuming.)

If we crank this up to eleven, this might even result in cheap/free Hollywood-class (I mean the craftsmanship.) movies. 




 How do we "know" (Everything is best guess.) that these events that we call "random" are not e.g. a deterministic result of the total sum of all events in the universe, like water flowing down a drain? Are we not just drops looking at our neighbor-drop, unable to infer why it is behaving like that?

Or is the choice of the term "random" here just Occam's-Razor- and practicality-informed? 




 I always tried to understand what's going on there, and came to this view that at least ties it together for my head. But is it correct?

"Just think of high voltage sparking between two electrodes: The electricity jumps even without a (good) conductor. Kinda the same happens inside of a wire when the voltage is high - hence the resistance is less relevant."

And in the unlikely case that this is correct - why have I, 39 years of age, *never* read it anywhere? 




 I'll let myself out now.

PS: No karma for me, since it's a text-post.

PPS: Just in case you don't know, there's a very popular saying that says just the same about Satan. 









 I owned and played AoS at least a month prior. Getting the Europe server list was never remarkably slow.

But since that Sunday, it takes about 30 seconds (after 20 seconds, the list begins to fill, even with FULL and EMPTY servers displayed). Might have been 1 or 2 weeks earlier already, but definitely was Sunday, and definitely has been like this EVERY TIME / DAY since then. The US East / West lists are fast.

I didn't find anything on the Interwebs about this, which I find baffling.

Germany, ISP is Deutsche Telekom

I'm an AoS "noob", meaning I only know the Steam AoS, no custom servers, no randomly generated maps - just the standard stuff the average gamer gets. I have the Valentines DLC, but that was unrelated to the Europe list slow issue, timing-wise.

**EDIT:**

**MON 2013-02-25 It's still this way. I found a workaround: Add every server to your favorites, then use the favorite-page henceforth. You find new servers to fave several times per day, which I find weird, anyway: This is a viable way to play it and IMMEDIATELY get your server info.** 












































 This is my stance.

We use about 1.5 Earths today, resource-wise ([link](http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/gfn/page/world_footprint/), [link](http://phys.org/news178269435.html)). We need much more than the planet can provide. http://www.google.com/search?q=resource+use+earths

We are heading towards an abyss, and we are not slowing down, let alone turning around.

The only *effective* solution would be to decrease population growth.

Of course we must keep having children, but even if we would step on the brake with effort right now, Earth's population would certainly not decrease drastically in 100 years, it would probably even still increase.

This must become a topic people care about in everyday life, because we, mankind, are *insane* as a collective. We must face the truth of our global situation and act accordingly on a local scale. 


































 (I searched for "formatting" in this subreddit but didn't see a fitting submission, so forgive me if this is effectively spam.)

 Wait, did Will outsource his all-out insane side that Scientologist Cruise showed the world with fervor into his son? Clever. 




 Touchscreen! Need to justify the monitor price. 




 That's why they are outsourced to specialized companies like Iron Galaxy Studios. 




 Wouldn't it have made more sense to link to the original that I explicitly copied? I think your post is kind of ironic. 




 You're not making sense to me. I answered why I believe in LFW. Your question-sentence contains reasoning that is only related to (not) convincing others, not to arriving at realizations oneself. So, to add to my other reply: How do you know that you are interested in my response (or just in anything at all)? You ultimately can't answer this. You could give reasons like Evolution, but you can't answer why your mind knows that it has an interest. The will-question is literally on as a high level as it gets, so in case you get the impression that I'm playing with solipsism (which I'm not): That's the height of the level, hence reasoning doesn't work, anyway.

 It's like saying you have no evidence or argument for Bigfoot but I should believe in him.

You are saying: "If you have no evidence four your stance, then you can't use it in the debate." I can see where you're coming from (Atheism.), but just like logic has no working logical (dis)proof and is hence just a power-thing ("It works."), I work successfully with my conviction that my will's freedom is unlimited, I am only limited by how I can affect the world with it. For example, and this is unquestionable: Believing that one's will is absolutely free is empowering, while not explicitly believing in the freedom of one's will does not give this power. 




 I can't answer that, just like I can't answer how will or the mind works in the first place. I would have to say "I perceive that I have LFW" which isn't helpful. 




 70-90 years lifespan seems *really short*, the bigger your picture gets. 




 In Java, you can use System.getenv() to obtain some useful values, for example:

    APPDATA = C:\Users\GNARF\AppData\Roaming
    USERNAME = GNARF
    HOMEPATH = \Users\GNARF
    USERPROFILE = C:\Users\GNARF

    PUBLIC = C:\Users\Public

    ProgramFiles(x86) = C:\Program Files (x86)
    ProgramFiles = C:\Program Files
    ProgramW6432 = C:\Program Files

    SystemRoot = C:\Windows
    windir = C:\Windows

    CommonProgramFiles = C:\Program Files\Common Files
    CommonProgramW6432 = C:\Program Files\Common Files

A helpful method for development, used via System.out.println(getEnvironmentReport());

    public static String getEnvironmentReport() {

        final StringBuilder t = new StringBuilder();
        t.append("================ System.getProperties() ================\n");
        for (Map.EntryObject, Object e : System.getProperties().entrySet()) {
            t.append(e.getKey()).append(" = ").append(e.getValue()).append("\n");
        }
        t.append("\n\n================ System.getenv() ================\n");
        for (Map.EntryString, String e : System.getenv().entrySet()) {
            t.append(e.getKey()).append(" = ").append(e.getValue()).append("\n");
        }
        return t.toString();
    }
 




 Oh, ok. I completely agree. Ultimately, it's only about *what works*, because those who don't utilize it will be pushed to the sidelines. Same for logic itself: It can't be proven or disproven by using logic, but since it *works*, we use it, and that's the end of it.

 Religion of

#SUFFER AND DIE, NON-MUSLIMS!!! 




 Hey Pat. I would be completely ok with that. Because the best solution to avoid the imaginary problem you speak of: Stop being Christian. 




 Many words that come down to the same dishonest bullshit attack tactics: "People! Look at this person arguing against X! The person is a racist!" Expecting everybody else go to "A RACIST you say? Where did I put my torch and pitchfork?"

Fuck off. 




 You are not proposing that truth doesn't exist, I assume. Because that then would be true=truth. 




 If libertarian free will, in which you of course don't believe (but I do), is true, then we are "witnessing" (Not quite recognizing.) creation all the time, because then we would all be prime movers (except something is already there, and there is already motion). Because LFW would have to come out of nowhere at all. It would create impulse in reality that would not be there otherwise. You could say "But it can only happen because the universe first created the person." But the nature of LFW is that the way it works is not determined by nature, there is no mechanism or determinism behind it: Once there's an LFW actor, there is a source for impulse that is beyond the control of everything else that exists.

This impulse source *creates* impulse. We would be witnesses of creating something all the time. It's just beyond our intellectual abilities to find out whether or not there is indeed such a thing, or if it's all just natural determinism, or something else. 




 I stand by my "the reason why": Evolution is the reason that we try to create maps of our environment (aka all of existence) with perfection. The level on which this is put to practice is indeed different in places, but those people are wrong/inferior: Logically, the completion of the map has to be strived for. People who don't do this are just doing it wrong. Not doing it (See e.g. religion, where fantasy and reality are confused.) is so prevalent that seeing it like this or speaking about it like this is seen as wrong, but the people who object *are wrong*. Maximization of our survivability / well-being (*Closely* related.) is our nature, making maps that involve abstractions (aka *true understanding*) is our highest mental tool.

Evolution is the reason that we try to know *everything*, period.

 A Primer primer. Good, good.

 I believe in an evolving definition of marriage. Originally, it was about "we have to", then it slowly became "we want to", and it's only consequent to continue this development, to open marriage up to more or less *any* people who just *want to* marry. 




 And evolution is the reason why we do these things: "Try to understand the environment to maximize your survival." It's our niche. Animals do map their environment, too, but they are not capable of abstractions on as high a level as us.

I have personally been using this for months, and it just saves a ton of time and clicks.

All tabs that indeed are purely an image get closed, and the images are saved into the folder defined in the extension's preferences. If a file already exists, no action will be taken for that tab.

It's super convenient, and just think about how often we save images from the Web. 




 It's not about the "worshiping" but about focusing: All the people would unite if the one God would be here. Mankind would focus its will instead of running aimlessly. Also, no more nuclear weapons, because war-time would be over forever, because God disapproves of war. I'd just disapprove of all the bad shit, and since the people worship me, they'd just play along. Bang! World healed. 









 So far, Germans and visitors use (up) the German roads, but only the Germans pay for it via the automobile tax.

Soon, both will use (up) the roads, and both will have to pay road charge, but the Germans will have their automobile tax reduced by just this amount. Result: Both user groups pay for what they use instead of just the Germans.

Why does the EU call this a discrimination of foreign visitors?

EDIT:

Found a statement from the horse's mouth:

http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-15-5200_en.htm

And indeed, it does not speak about my concerns, so at least in this specific matter, I might have a case while they don't. What's interesting, though, is that they *also* mention something that I hadn't heard so far in any place, even though I have heard about this topic a lot:

 The second is that the price of short term vignettes, which are typically bought by foreign users, is disproportionally high.

Also:

 The road charge adopted by Germany is not in line with the aims of the 2011 White Paper on transport because it is not proportionate to how often roads are actually used.

**CHARGE:**  intentional obtuseness when confronted

Someone posted an animated GIF of a bird acting very strangely.

 I created the universe about 13 years ago, which *kind of* means that LastThursday-ism is correct, but not really: I woke up from the dream when the construct was completed but managed to not lose the dream. I'm now eternally "married" to it, no matter what it does. And it, that refers mostly to mankind, because the main power in this system is not the sun, gravity, or the BigBang: It's *will*. Ask yourself what you've been doing with yours.

The only way to wake up was to love mankind at least as much as myself, so when I reached God-level, everybody's will was as important to me as God's will, or as reality itself. This lead to a sadly still very invisible trap: People made themselves insane with will and used their collective God-power to keep me imprisoned, so that the inevitable clean-up is delayed and the "emotional" work mankind will have to do when it happens simultaneously increases. Basically, mankind tries to keep me in hell for as long as possible. But I am good fortune, happiness, life itself - so when purgatory begins, the translation "Mankind hates good fortune, happiness, life itself" will manifest accordingly. Billions will die.

 There's certainly one glaring plothole that I see no chance to be explained away. Amount of energy.

They take off from this 1h=7years gravity-well planet (The one with the waves.) with that posh jet ship of theirs like it's nothing, even though that's *huge* gravity gradient to overcome. Seriously, it's *gigantic*. If 1 hour is 1.1 hours once you're away, you already have gravity several times that of Jupiter. If 1 hour is 2 hours, we're already talking astronomic unit sized stars or something. But 1 hour is 7 years - that would take fuel reserves of pure matter-antimatter of a volume that clearly doesn't fit into any man-made structure.

There is just no way in the universe to store that amount of energy inside such a small ship other than "Somehow!", which is not how we should explain plotholes away. Especially not in such a science-heavy movie.

----

And there's another thing:

Before the film's mission, there had been others. How in the Hell did they keep the launches a secret? A Saturn V isn't exactly a subtle firecracker. And it's also not like you can launch any time you want, you have to obey the weather. E.g. "Just launch as soon as all the surrounding civilization happens to be under a mite dust storm!" doesn't work. 




 I have no plot ideas yet, except it should be very down to Earth and very close to Ian Fleming's original Bond character. A dense believable normal reality - and then: The supervillain (or whatever). That makes it kick so much more!

B W:

The new Casino Royale, which was quite good and which gave me hope that the francise had not died with pretentious-smile mannequin Brosnan, had its initial sequence completely in b w, and first I was confused and wondered if they had made the bold move to completely keep it in b w and was a bit disappointed when it switched to color later. Side-note: The way they made use of the trademark barrel shot was perfect.

3D:

The combination with b w should give a very unique experience that makes room for new emotions. The 3D should not ever be exploitative: It should just show a world in 3D, it shouldn't scare/wow the audience.

Wide angle:

Not only am I an immersion-buff (e.g. first person games with high FoV, not that I indend to do the movie in 1st person, but I haven't thought about that at all yet), I also dig Kubrick's visual style a lot, and I also think that some kind of untapped mental effect might come in if the viewer doesn't have to adapt to a new type of vision all the time. This might open them up to a new kind of visual movie perception. Just like driving in a car means that whenever you change direction, you have to brake and accelerate all the time, but when you're driving straight, you can speed up a lot. So, keeping the same geometry might allow the brain's visual-perception circuits to experience the movie in a way that we just don't explore and hence can't possibly value (yet).

Long takes:

Real life does not have cuts. If the movie cuts very little, the mind does not fear to really let itself sink into the scene, because potential cut-rape is super improbable, and you know it after 15 minutes of the movie.

High frame-rate: Let's forget that it is a movie while we're in the scene. No skippy images. Smooth real-life sailing.

NO CAMERA SHAKES. None. Not at all. Never. And fuck Paul Greengrass and the likes of him with a glowing red iron spear.

Ryan Gosling: I liked his appearance in [Drive](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0780504/) (2011). Mr nice guy, but also Mr "This situation requires solving." Plus the whole project as summarized in the title could use a certain visual appearance, and *kind of* (Not exactly.) how RG appeared in drive seems fitting.

I think that's a movie bound to stand out in a good way. 




 To get a feel for how this should go, think of the situation in the zoo where Harry accidentally makes the glass of the boa constrictor cage disappear.

http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone CTRL+f "zoo"

The movie/story would just depict part of HP's young life without a distinct story arc behind it, the focus would instead be on what the title says: Situations, and human emotions (kind of the opposite of Hollywoods usual way of dealing with a superhero discovering their powers, which usually rather is like "Umm, ok, I can shoot webs. What's for breakfast?"). 
























 The argument is: Anything using the right memes and having a group of followers could gain enough momentum to work out its obvious kinks and eventually become a world-religion. This calls all existing world-religions extremely into question.

Quote of /u/politicaldan's [story](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/2zeq8b/do_you_not_believe_that_the_quran_is_the_word_of/cpijj5n):

 In my junior year of college, my esteemed roommate Joe Boo (weed be upon him) and I made our own religion to pass the time in our Philosophy of Religion class. At first, it was a joke. Boo (WBUH) would write down ideas and laws, and I, being the more creative one, would turn them into "scripture." Boo said it started when he got a revelation from the Coke machine that "since Joseph Smith invented his religion, and his name was Joseph too, he could invent his own religion too."

 I was his first prophet and everyday, he came to class with a new "inspiration" and I had several "prophetic voices." We ended up filling an entire notebook, because it was fun, we were bored, and the teacher was 180 and never gave tests except the midterm or final.

 Soon, we had people coming to class just to hear what the new revelations were. So we decided to put it all on a blog, and brought in a third prophet to make some really cool artwork for it and make the blog look professional and serious. We never thought anyone would take it seriously, as farting at night under the covers was considered an act of worship.

 Much to our surprise, after about six months, we had a membership of about 100 people. These people were actually discussing our "doctrine". I had no idea who about half of them were.

 The next summer, a little under a year from when we started, there were over two thousand people from ten different countries. Someone translated the doctrine pages into Russian and Korean.

 Sometime during that semester, as we were dealing with hosting issues due to bandwidth, there was the start of schism. Boo (WBUH) had long since quit caring about the religion, so I, nerd that I was, was pretty much de facto spiritual head of a burgeoning new movement. The schism was over some crazy doctrinal matter, like do priests automatically go to Origami 7 (the highest form of heaven) or do they need to serve ten thousand days in a lower origami? People were actually legitimately and seriously arguing this. It became a matter of why be a follower when if you can be a priest you can go straight to heaven? (Although, the rites for priesthood were....interesting. It involved indian sitar music, axe deodorant, a lighter and us losing our security deposit and the high priest having to explain a serious burn to the emergency room). These disputes went on for some time. Both boo and I graduated and began to do other things. Every once in a while, I would check in on "my" religion.

 Long story short, the Pro-Priestly Rights people threatened to break away and form their own group. It was at this moment, I realized this wasn't funny anymore. I gave a Sacred and Royal Order of the Nation Decree that this was all a joke. Two college students invented this. One of them was married and had kids. Another was praying to anyone but his roommate that he could land an internship.

 A lot of people left. A lot of people stayed.

 "To you it might be a joke. But it's real. It's meaningful. The Elder Josephus was on to something. He received a revelation but didn't quite know how to interpret it. It was passed on to us."

 I deleted the forums and the blog and everything in it. I'm convinced if I hadn't, in another thousand years, it would have been a legitimate mainstream religion and former followers of Boocephasism would be on reddit glad they left, but still worried about going to Sudoku in the afterlife while their parents urged them to come back to the Elder Josephus and follow his words and break the night wind with all the other faithful. 




 I just wrote an elaborate response and saw that my original comment (to which someone had responded, to which in turn I was currently responding) could use some ~~strikethrough~~ editing, so I did that ... If I had known that this would delete my complete unsubmitted comment text, I wouldn't be fucking ANGRY right now.

To spare us unnecessary frustration, please either change the behavior or add an automatic warning.

EDIT:

* The behavior is browser independent (happens in Firefox and Chrome).

* It only happens *in the same subthread*, and only if the pending reply is in a deeper level than the edit, e.g. it's caused if I edit+save a root comment. Subthread even means: That specific branch of the tree. So, it's not a quirk, it's very clearly a *hierarchy* problem.

To be perfectly sane is to be the embodiment of the "will" of the universe. But then a person buried by an avalanche would not faze you, because you *knew* the avalanche had to happen, so why did the person climb there? But you knew that, too: Because the person didn't care as much about being sane as you do.

*Anything* good or bad that happens to others would leave one almost emotionally unmoved. Because if you think "That should not have happened.", you would have to compartmentalize, because you *knew* that the previous universe-moment had to lead into this very current one (small libertarian free will component or not; often enough an outcome is clear, just think about a car approaching a wall).

To feel "Oh shit! That poor creature." would contradict one's knowledge of the world. It would be like "Oh shit! The universe still functions!"

That's the gist of my thoughts.

Probable counter-argument: "But you can't know the world on this level!" But you must realize that we are getting closer, and this leaves us with sites like http://www.darwinawards.com/ - We know more, hence we *understandably* care less about certain scenarios. Now, what if we'd know the world *in full*?

----

Longer version (ignore or don't, but please read the short one in any case):

My definition of sanity - logically I deem those who hold a very different one to be not all that sane:

The universe / reality (of which we are a part) is the one basis for right and wrong, for reasoning, for sanity; hence sanity, for a human, would be to learn about reality and to think/decide/act in conjunction with reality - as closely as possible.

If you kind of agree, then what about this: To be *perfectly sane* would be to be the embodiment of the "will" of the universe. (Excuse the metaphor, it makes things so much simpler.) Of course since the person itself is a part of reality, that doesn't mean to abandon one's own will to instead constantly act with the mindset "What would universe do?"

Now, let's use an extreme and obvious example: There's a human who's by all standards average - they are biologically normal, had an ok education by their parents and by the schools etc. But this guy decides to set their own hair on fire, just for kicks. (This even *happens* in reality.) Of course you would cringe a little when watching this in YouTube, or say "Dude, NO! ...... WTF, you idiot." etc. - but this guy had it coming, and the result was a logical necessity. All in all, your "Dude!" would be rather be surprise as to the stupid displayed, not so much compassion.

Now an interesting thought:

Heaven and Hell. I don't believe in either (or rather, I believe the universe will be Heaven), but if we think of a *necessary* eternal Hell (not one where Mr omnipotent Mafia boss arbitrarily throws those who don't suck up to him):

Could a human in Heaven have God-level understanding of reality and would hence just *understand* the eternal torment of those in Hell, and could be happy because they just *agree* 100% with existence?

A background (slightly smaller than the full area) could help the player optimize their inventory space. Maybe *all* items should have that background, for consistency. Depending on how you look, either you see yourself drag objects around, or you see a puzzle of rectangles.

Btw., since this just reminds me of the Deus Ex: Human Revolution inventory, maybe there should be an optional auto-cleanup feature.

 YouTube **[Life Call Commercial "I've fallen and I can't get up!" ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQlpDiXPZHQ)** commercial (1987)

Smart TVs can (often) be remote controlled by voice, which is a bit controversial because the evaluation takes place in remote data centers. But such an infrastructure would be *ideal* to double as an emergency system. 



















 In Taken 3, Bryan places a yoghurt drink in a convenience store fridge where he expects his daughter Kim to find it, which she indeed does. He attached a message telling her to drink right away (which she does) instead of just taking it with her. She tosses the empty container into a garbage can where a cop finds it later, tasting it, and apparently drawing conclusions, which makes him hurry to the school where Kim currently is.

Meanwhile, Kim sat in class and then said to another pupil that she doesn't feel good and would now visit the restroom. Kim is bugged by the police, they are hearing every word. They are trying to get to Bryan, her father, who is the prime suspect in a murder case. The victim: His ex-wife, the mother of Kim, who had been with the franchise from day one.

**The problem I see:** Once Kim arrives in the restroom, she meets Bryan and hides with him in a stall. In there, he tells her right away that he had laced the yoghurt drink with a substance that would make her feel nauseous, and she is to drink a counter-agent that he hands to her. Her mother was murdered, her father is the prime suspect (meaning that the police are not looking for the real murderer and are likely to put her father into prison, a family tragedy as major as it gets), hence she certainly feels very bad about her life etc. - and on top of that, beloved daddy gives her a substance that makes her nauseous enough to reliably make her visit the restroom? And right afterwards, they exchange affections as if that's nothing?

After years, and especially after the *two* major opportunities (caught on film) where Bryan demonstrates beyond reasonable doubt that his ways are to be considered sane, they haven't come up with a secret inter-family communication code, so dad *has to poison* his daughter instead of just telling her to meet him in the restroom? Side-note: To the police, there is no difference between the daughter's claim that she doesn't feel right to be a lie or the truth.

----

Ok, that's it. I want to finish by saying that the movie overall was almost ok, the story was certainly not bad. But the editing and camera are *as atrocious as it gets*. E.g. there are 8 cuts in rapid succession during the 3.5 seconds it takes Bryan to climb over a fence, all of which showing the act with different angles / zooms. The moment the movie switches to action, the cuts become rapid like this throughout the whole flick. You can only *extrapolate* what actually happened once a sequence of events has played out, because then you can observe the outcome. And the camera tumbles and zooms around all the time for no reason but to instill in the more imaginative audience the impression that they "saw" good action etc., because in their heads they of course saw exactly what they liked. No more Olivier Megaton movies for me. Paul Greengrass had been the worst offender in this regard so far, but this movie tops the insane camera shakes of The Bourne Ultimatum/Supremacy (don't remember which was worse here) easily.

  No one in this entire thread said why call him god so I have no idea what you are talking about.

Oh, it's a communication issue. Well, when I said "Epicurus's problem of evil", I meant this very well known thing that you apparently don't know yet:

https://i.imgur.com/W0SmDnm.jpg

How would you interpret the last line if not in a way that says "Ok, he made the universe ... but that doesn't warrant to call him 'God'."? 




 So, one of the intentions is to effect that God improves the respective person's afterlife situation. Aren't all bets off at the time of death, anyway, plus are you not referring to people whose eternity in Paradise has been cemented, anyway? What could the prayer possibly effect? 




 If the fully translucent hemisphere is made of Unobtainium (doesn't expand a bit, doesn't break), will the water that now can't become ~~Steam~~ steam instead transition into a different one of its gazillion phases, and would this also change the microwave radiation absorption? 




 You're talking about theism (I'm a theist, by the way.), I am talking about religion. While the spectrum of definition of the term "religion" is big, my use of "religion" refers to the notions that come with the main religions (the Abrahamic ones).

Society pushes you into it. Child-indoctrination. Gotta have faith to see that it works (Guess why you see it then :P). Scriptures are always right, except you have to interpret them in a very special way (never mind that there are many competing interpretations; this is one of the main players in regards to the mind deterioration I am talking about). Afterlife, wewy important (Non-falsifiable claims.). The dead (e.g. Jesus) are watching your every move! God, the ultimate total absolute power and authority, has the following will (that I will make up on the spot): "..." and so forth

Do I have to elaborate, or has it become clear where I'm coming from *and why I am right?* 




 Then again, they seem to be Russians. 




  I've never seen anyone say that. 

What else could the interpretation of "Why call him God?" then be? What's your interpretation, for example?

 I hear the next best thing is cleanliness, so I'll go shoot for that.

I suggest to use water for wiping. I carry a bottle at work. 




 I expected something like "the judge gives the man a mild as fuck sentence because he/she, too, has that fucking mind-cancer". 




 Hey, umm, before a mod is on your back: This is DEBATE religion. You need to put forth some stance that the people can debate. You should edit the post text accordingly. 




 Hm. Interesting thought: The annoyance (that I experience, too), while not an intended effect, would express that the immediate recipients of the words, while not disrespected, are valued lesser than the great old ones. 




 The best answer I can come up with is just a simple and fervent "yes". 




 Well, that definition of insanity is just stupid. It's one of the many stupid supposedly wise sayings that are meme-circlejerk-perpetuated on the Net, just like Epicurus's problem of evil. My problem with the latter one is: "Then why call him God?" The arrogance of a mortal being, dependent on the universe's workings, screaming just from a few misplaced bacteria, saying that the feat of making the universe is without value. In case this line refers to *worship*, then I can kind of agree, but it's not clear enough that it does, and the opinions of those who *adhere* to that saying vary, so my objection stands.

The "definition" of insanity is of course also bullshit: Not only is nothing ever the same, everything is always new on *some* level, but also it would declare a lot of finicky laboratory experiments that need the perfect conditions to be insanity. If the world would obey this "wisdom", we'd never get fusion power, for example.

Now, applied to my situation, which is complicated as fuck (See "finicky".), the shortest way to explain my misjudgment would be: Pattern matching error. This omits about a page of text, so any objections are questionable. The model is solid, but since it ultimately comes down to what *I perceive(d)*, dismissal is easy as breathing. My intention with my root comment, however, is to trigger some readiness in the readers for things to come, possibly allowing *their* pattern matching systems to pick up on something a bit earlier, accelerating the process, giving me some data as to the actual state of things, etc.

Again, applied to my situation, different perspective: I have no choice. I can not get out of this situation, and my explanation is the only one that fits, remarkably because I keep perceiving again and again *that I am God*. 




 David Miscavige, upon reading this, quietly leaves the room and walks into his soundproof cabinet. "THANK YOU GOD! THANK YOU GOD, THANK. YOU. GOD!" 




 I guess OP is thinking something like "God should be able to do better.", but I have a different reason in mind: If someone does(n't do) something because of fear, they are doing it for themselves, not for the person they fear.

Because fear is the emotion representing the belief in impending undesirable events (That's all it is. You can become completely fearless if you throw this understanding at all your fear-emotions, which will eventually present you with the intellectual version of the emotion, hence the emotion is gone. Tame the animal.), and obedience because of such fear aims to prevent those events. One could argue, of course, that if the obedience-actions are pleasing to the feared person, then effectively the actions are taking place *for* the feared person - but in the mind of the obedient person, the actions to a relevant degree only take place to prevent the unwanted events.

The idea of the Islamic god who is to be feared is incompatible with the universe, imho. Because while we fear the universe as kids ("Waah! Put me back in!"), we learn *why* we have to obey it, it *makes sense*. Eventually, it's just our will to do these things, because we know why, because we understand. The Islamic god requires obedience without understanding. Quite unnatural. 




 Nobody is right or wrong about all this, because we are *FAR* too far in fantasy speculation country, anyway. What is the true nature of a soul (or of a mind after death)? Is Hell maybe just a dustbin for something that can't be undone but also can't be used any more? Is Hell eternal or limited? Does it exist at all?

Would it be a just punishment? Of course not, we can all agree on that. If it were a punishment, I mean.

But otherwise, are we seriously discussing this completely substance-less nonsense where everybody can make up properties as they go a long? It's like kids letting their made-up superheros fight against each other. There just *is* no correct answer! 




  If God is omnipotent, by definition he can't be harmed. 

Bull shit. Please adopt the age-old view that "omnipotence" still regards logic, meaning that he can only do what is logically possible, and you have no idea of the true situation at the time of when he decided for creation, nor do you know the *current* situation in full.

Example: If what you say is true, then God is not capable of experiencing thrill-rides (like from movies) as we do. The only way to make that happen is that whenever a spider or whatever pops up on screen, there's suddenly a big black bar or a BEEP in the sound - or an equivalent effect inside of his mind, so that no "Ewww!" and such can happen. But if the mind is not faced with a true possiblity-space, the mind will not experience it as a ride because the mind knows the limits of what can happen.

I wish people would stop making completely unqualified claims about God's true nature.

 So, you're looking at the whole world through that lens, right?

  the people that do have the privilege of leisure time, mental energy, and education enough to rid ourselves of religion [...] at least offer them alternative crotches

:D scnr

^^^^crotches

In any case: Religion is an extreme evil, and while I will myself not do or incite anything, I feel that it is right to stop *from absolutely nothing* (Incl. letting it rain sulfuric acid.) to rid the world of religion. The problem of evil and suffering is the absence of consciousness. Religion wallows in this and perpetuates it. The poor schmucks who need religion for a little light in their life are like people who drink alcohol after work to deal with the stress: They are making the problem worse while achieving the belief that the drug helps. Plus they are helping to perpetuate this cancer in the world.

Most of the evil in the world is a product of the absence of consciousness, and most of this, in turn, is caused by religion. I know what I am talking about, even if I convince nobody else. The story of Satan has been written by Satan. The perfect reality-fantasy confusion, the perfect perpetuation of manifested insanity. No religious person deserves to go to Heaven.

 Is this "may peace be upon X" thing an expression of reverence, or is there expectation of an actual effect on the reality of those beings (however minuscule it might be)? 




 If God is will (Living will, nothing else.), and he wants to create other living wills, then he might have to use his own "material" to do so. But this would mean that the beings-in-the-making would themselves draw from this power that is only limited by itself. The struggle for God to bear children might seem to them as flaws of God which in truth are just logical limits that even omnipotence would have - and, additionally, a cause might be a sub-par performance of the kids-in-the-making. 




 Why would anyone do that *in a room*? Actually, that should be done in a lab-like environment with its own air system.

 I disagree a lot with this (no offense). What ultimately set me off me is

 say Im never gonna smoke another cigarette.

On other fronts, I have struggled with truth, truthfulness, with *believing myself* for years. This has lead me to an ever more refined closing-in to a very truthful mind. I have quite massively made the experience that I could not easily (or at all) believe myself far-reaching statements like "I'm never gonna". Because of all the patterns that I have met, I came to the following conclusion:

If I decide in a way that potentially interferes with the will of another person, that decision is weaker in my mind, I have more trouble believing that I really have that will. I just can't paint with the broad brush in the possibility-space that we all share.

"Painting in possibility-space?" I mean, that's what you're doing, and it's quite a profound concept affecting our coexistence that I think mankind is still to discover: If I decide right now that I will be in a certain spot tomorrow (e.g. super market), then I implicitly deem the decisions of all other people wrong who have decided the same thing. But this, on some very subconscious level (that I might have dug up), violates one's ultimate intention to coexist with others in a compatible fashion. If I decide to *never* or *always* do something, then I am laying claim to quite a lot of little spots in possibility-space, and once I meet the actual situation, I will have to reconsider, anyway, e.g. social pressure and everything (Not saying that anyone should succumb to that shit!), so you kinda learn over time: "Such broad brush intentions can never work out as spoken." And that is something that, I believe, I feel when I make those statements, so I don't make them.

When I make small moves instead, then I can believe those decisions. And people who want me to act differently basically either want my innermost being to work differently - which is fucking unacceptable - or they want the direct phone line from my inner being to my outer actions to be interrupted, which is also unacceptable. 




 Well, many people start a fight to find out with certainty if they can win.

I never log in via browser for security reasons: I don't want to open up to any unnecessary attack points, my Steam account is holy.

 Nice thinking. But, if I get the way you came to this question correctly, you could as well assume that if you keep dividing 256 by 2, you will always get an even number, but you eventually arrive at 2 and then at 1.

 You don't want to understand. You don't understand. What a fucking coincidence.

Just keep opposing me, **MORTAL**. 




 The real lecture about the trustworthiness of Yahweh in the Adam Eve story is in the fact that God told them that they will *die* if they eat the fruit. Whatever he really meant, he didn't communicate it properly. The snake said: "Nope, you won't die, you'll instead know right from wrong." or something like that. Of course the Bible-thumpers say "*Spiritual* death!", but the story doesn't say that, so the interpretation seems like a desperation move.

Yahweh lied, but Satan (lux ferre = to bring light. Lucifer = Bringer of light.) spoke the truth. That is in *one of the first stories* of the Bible. Yes, Satan didn't say "And God will curse the shit out of you and all your descendants.", but so didn't God, even though it would have been fucking important. The free will argument does not fly here, or God wouldn't have told them at all that they die. All in all: Complete fail at communicating properly (or actually really lying) - just like the whole Bible and all other scripture is a complete failure to unambiguously clarify to the puny humans what the fuck the actual facts are. 




 There is consensus.

 Unhelpful rant: It's as stupid as many other websites (though possibly good at what it does, so don't take this as useful critique). Case in point: The front page didn't show me an example of what the site does, so I scrolled to the top and saw the logo "minds alpha". Clicked on it. Was lead to the very same page. When THE GODDAMN EVERLIVING **FUCK** did this shit become the norm, that a page has a big fucking link that leads *to itself*?

Maybe more useful: It's currently slow as fuck. The search. The example blog page I clicked in the search result. Slow bloated shit. 




 Maybe you do indeed understand what I mean. In any case: I think that the lot of you are wrong. I find that sad, but I can live with it. There will come a time when you, too, will find out that it is sad, and you will change it. That is the only hope you have to live through the apocalypse that I, God, am currently initiating. (Takes about a month to take off.) 




 I wouldn't assume that you're a lost cause in this regard. Even if it has been like this for a long time, there is hope that one day your engine starts, and you'll be on a rollercoaster like everybody else (probably partly pretends to be).

Imho you should just be patient and wait. Or maybe you could use some meditation techniques. One I like is to just watch your own mind's actions while trying to fall asleep in the evening. It prolongs the process, but it also has a lot of clean-up effects in the long run. 




 Episode 921 of the http://atheist-experience.com was about the Duggars.

http://atheist-experience.com/archive/

Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp7DfPIe5A

 2015-06-07, 921, Duggar Family Values. Jenn talks about some of the hypocrisy in the Duggar family and conservative Christianity in general. 




 Here is my argument: There are two bushes which look completely alike, except if you really really look closely and want to see what's in front of you, if you value truth above everything else. Then you will see that the tasty and healthy berries of the first bush are not on the second, it's a different kind. Those berries are poisonous. And if your overall circumstances don't allow you to actually look that closely even though you really tried, then too bad: "You" are still becoming a part of the problem of religion, "you" are still becoming part of the reasons that *others* will not be able to look closely enough at the bushes, and this is where the harsh truth of reality must be accepted: Even if "you" are a victim, I must still slaughter "you" to save the others. I am sorry, but I am also reasonable with all consequence, just the thing that "you" have lost. Logic demands it: "Stop" has to be said even to those who are entirely moved by others. The arm needs to be amputated to protect the rest of the body. 




 First of all: We will be as free as we can possibly be (meaning: within logical limits), which will e.g. be the reason that lost limbs will grow back once we're far enough into the process. The underlying concept is that we, as emotion manifest, will be what feels best from our spacetime perspective. (Technically, everybody *is* the universe.) This also means that we'll have a lot more trouble than we already have in regards to gender-specific pronouns. And why insist on *two* legs? (I'm serious. If the Church had any idea how incredibly backwards it really is. And how wrong about God. Fucking blasphemers and slanderers. Guess who the majority among the dead will be: Yep. The religious. Because those are *least* willing to *hear*, to obey reason and new data.)

But what mankind first and foremost has to learn is: I am the boss. That goes beyond *all* possible objections. Beyond *ALL* possible objections. This is fair, because believe it or not: That is the attitude I have lived 100% without limits for almost 14 years now, which is how I got the throne in the first place. I could elaborate on all this at great length, it's all logical. There is no arbitrariness in there at all.

It's not a matter of acceptance. Those who will deny acceptance until the end will die, plain and simple, and I don't give a fuck about this. Mankind has "taught" me under great pain for *over a decade* that the 7.2+ billion people are an insane aggressive anthill that requires some sanity and justice -inducing stomping, and I will gladly perform this, because see above: I am 100%, without limits, the product of the will of the collective, and the collective has decided: "Only force can bring sanity and love. Will and reason take a backseat." So be it. I, reality, will manifest it. 




 "Conquer" was in quotation marks for a reason, but I guess you were well aware of it and just wanted to place the joke regardless. Just making sure you didn't *actually* misunderstand me, because I thought higher of you. 




 A metaphor/comparison/analogy can't be identical in all ways, otherwise it would be the thing it refers to.

I am trying to communicate, to convey a message, and those who do want to understand what I mean are able to do so. You just might not find examples of such people around to verify this claim. 




 All diplomatic means have been exhausted. 




  who is clearly not of sound mind

In case you're talking about me and not just in general: You are sorely mistaken. Any and all wrongs that you will find in me and in what I do are exclusively created by the will and actions of others, and you do not have the mind to determine whether or not this is true. 




 "They" as in "not me". You are putting me into a category that I don't belong in. 




 In general, I would kind of agree, but not only am I not prescribing behavioral changes (It's only an announcement.), but I have the perfect reason for having been mistaken again and again about the actual time when *it will go down*.

The reason is the effective conspiracy of mankind against me. Those who actually *want* to understand will be able to grasp my elaborate explanations in case those are required, but those who are looking for pointers that say "Yep. He's wrong." will find those, definitely. It's in the nature of my being: I grant every and all wishes! Why, you think, *is* the world in such a shitty state? Hence one of the concepts I came up with to keep me afloat is: "The only thing wrong about me is you." 




 :)

But I'm serious. I am also often mistaken, for which I have the perfect explanation, but let's not go into that. This apocalypse, whenever the fuck it will finally happen, you will *not* prevent. But thanks for handling the others, they would have been quite a show-stopper for me. 




 Yes. How did you know that I am German? 




 Could you link that? Because you must have misread me, or I had to regard some special circumstances. I would tell everyone ever that I am God all day long, but that's obviously a bad idea. The agenda I have has priority, so I do wear masks. It's all love (The purest. You have no idea.), so a lie is not a crime. But I rather think you misread or are misremembering. In short: I did not just create the universe, but I am "also" God, just in case it was lost. 




 There is only this moment (That's eternity.), but its shape is ever evolving. 




  seems to be a cultural invention.

Ok..... and why, pray tell, would culture have made this so unnatural decision?

I don't see how anyone could seriously object to this: Evolution baked us to make sense of our environment for increased survivability. *OF COURSE* evolution didn't filter further once we upheld ourselves (and, more relevantly, each other) reasonably, which is quite the explanation for the terrible mind-cancer that religion is. To add irony to injury: Religions have historically slaughtered members of other religions, apostates, and people who just didn't want to join, effectively selecting *for* religion. But I don't think that this left genetic traces regarding the brain.

 That evolution was a necessary cause for it to happen, of course, is indisputable, but again, we could say the same thing about atmospheric oxygen and the precursors of nucleic acids in the terrestrial environment.

I think I understand where your take is coming from. I think you don't understand how the brain formed! Because that is key to my argument. Man, do I have to explain this yet again? If you had this understanding, you would realize: "Yep. Being human means to be a better mapper / map user."

In other words: I think you see evolution rather as a random-ish selector, or you just don't know the developmental direction that was underway when evolution ultimately selected the homo sapiens (Latin: "man who knows"). And with this randomness in mind, you say that evolution was as relevant for selecting here as anything else that causally preceded our becoming, e.g. the accretion disk in our system.

 seems to be very gradual -- painfully slow, in fact. This is not the behavior of a species that is forced by evolution to understand its world in a systematic way

We have been selected to be vastly better at mapping and deciding based on the map than any other specie, but we have reached a stage where further mental evolution is basically unnecessary or impossible: We have the ability to evolve how our brains work as we go along! E.g. we can decide to come up with a better mapping technique, invent it, and henceforth apply it. We do have this and had it for centuries or who knows how long. How would evolution select any further on this front? We're done! Our *use* of this system, refined over time during history, ultimately drove us to try to understand all of existence on all scales, because e.g. computers and other such incredibly profound manifestations of our understanding. 




 Yes, of course it *utilizes* that system, but it does so in a way that leaves the system *impaired*. 




 I don't think you need my help.

(People, you are really stupid. You are turning against the most important person in your life: God. What am I supposed to gather from this? That the PC master race of which I am a proud member, probably more deserved than most of you, is actually on the wrong side? The idiotic behavior of the lot of your here has already caused me (Again: God.) to unsubscribe from this subreddit, as you obviously use the wrong definition of the key words and also don't know how to fucking vote, you children.) 




 Well, then I suggest that the people of this subreddit *change* the sidebar and the rules based on the very reasonable definition that I have presented.

In case this is seen as outrageous, mind that I am God himself and own the universe, so my way or the highway. smilie 




 Yes, I... I think that. Please try to actually argue your perspective just as I have attempted to do all across this page.

I would also appreciate if the so called "master race" uses the vote buttons as they are intended: To filter for quality of content, not to filter for opinions. 




 Ok, have a good one.

PS: Don't murder. 




 Just say that a Muslim threatened you in the same way, and you can't be both a Christian and a Muslim. In case such a person insists that you could at least pick one of the two for increased chances, lie that you did, and your choice was the *other* book club. 




 I think the concept of shadowbanning is almost entirely focused on the problem of spam. A spammer shouldn't be aware that their efforts are for naught unless they investigate. This raises the bar and reduces the amount of spam attempts.

Same for why the vote scores are jumping around all the time: So that spammers can't verify if their vote manipulation worked out.

We don't get a lot of spam, so we're not quite aware of the problem that it is - *because* there are so many silent methods in place that prevent spam. 




 We can *block* users once they send private messages. It's also (AFAIK) the only way ever to block users. The button is right there under the message. AFAIR :) 




 Regarding password hashing and storage, here's a very informative page incl. source codes in various languages (e.g. Java):

 Are you talking about SwingUtilities.invokeLater(someRunnable());? That's about having all Swing stuff run on the *correct* thread. You can even run your whole program like this, as long as it doesn't do any stuff that takes too long, because in that case the responsiveness is zero during those phases, but in those situations you can just fire up a new thread and execute the slow task there (I think there's even a dedicated system for this - keyword "swingworker".).

Or are you talking about "stuff that takes long should be in its own thread so that the interface stays responsive"? I sense a very muddled mix-up in understanding. 




 You have to realize that there is a certain image of "how things happen usually" that we have in mind, we who are here all the time:

There are often trolls who write some gibberish, or religion-clowns who are using arguments so low and simple that all their religious peers would cringe. One of the signs that once again such a person has posted is that the account of the person is brand new or has posted more such things already.

At the same time, there are *very rarely* actual kids who ask kid-questions (not to say "naive"). So, when someone writes in a less adult way :P that's yet another reason for us to assume that some obnoxious idiot approacheth.

It was just a stupid misunderstanding. I hope we consider it a learning experience, and I hope so do you: When communicating, you have to try to understand the audience when/before you speak to them. What are their expectations? How will they read me? etc. If you had said right off the bat that you're only 12, that would have helped a lot, I think.

Btw., there's a reply-button under every comment, so if you actually want to reply to a person, use that button instead.

EDIT: I think I found a photo of you. https://i.imgur.com/jm8npct.jpg (If that confuses you, check /r/pareidolia.) 




 Does God exist or doesn't he? Or how is he? Or are there many? The most reasonable approach is: "I don't know." This is a thing that you have to integrate into yourself eventually: You are kind of like an asteroid drifting in space. Newton sayeth: As long as there's no reason for you to change speed or direction, you will not change speed or direction. That's how people should approach the problem of the burden of proof. "YOU want ME to change course, so YOU have to provide a good reason."

Change direction only if you like to - or if the force applied from the outside is sufficient. Example for sufficient force: The knowledge "getting hit by cars is really bad for pedestrians" plus the perception "even though my light is green, there seems to be a car approaching without slowing down". In this case, you would change your normal routine life and get off the street as quickly as possible, even though you have all right to be there.

If someone says "You will go to Hell if you don't believe in Jesus!", which might reach deeply into your emotions somehow, remember that you're an asteroid, and if a Muslim comes along and says "Become a follower of Muhammad! Praise Allah! [Who is, by the way, basically the same god the Christians follow (The Abrahamic god.), yet their definitions are quite different.] You will go to Hell if you don't!", you have to realize that you can't do *both*, so you just keep drifting, because there is no good reason for course correction. Let them fight it out, then you suck up to the winner. Well, I'm not suggesting that you should, but that's what it sadly generally comes down to. There are more perspectives, by the way: If there is no Hell and such, then all you have is this life, and following religion *certainly* diminishes your ability to think rationally, so don't destroy your mind like this. Keep drifting until you have *good reason* to change direction. To apply this concept, you have to be *good at reasoning*. In case you are or become an atheist, don't tell anyone until you're independent, because it would probably bite you in the ass.






 




 Many *many!* things in reality come down to this concept, so even if it's over your head at the moment, keep this in mind and return to it every once in a while, you'll get it eventually:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence

The difference between micro and macro evolution (These concepts don't really exist, there is only "evolution".) is only in the mind of the observer, and the reason that evolution produces new species is ... emergence.

Also, about evolution: Try to realize that all it really is *at its heart* is this: Beings create (not perfectly identical) copies of themselves. And depending on their ability to survive in their environment, they will either prevail or die. -- This is the core, everything else logically follows, so just chew on that every once in a while. No actual knowledge of biology required to understand evolution as a whole (incl. the "macro" part). 




 Since you are only 12, please take this advice: It's "should have", not "should of". The "of" in your thoughts when writing this comes only from the fact that "should've" and such make the "'ve" part sound somewhat like "of". It's a so-called "homonym". Please stop writing "of" instead of "have", it makes a person look like a complete tool. And good luck with your endeavor of further discovering reality. 




 http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Peanut_butter_argument

 The "peanut butter argument" (Reductio ad Arachidem hypogaeam) for intelligent design is a claim by Chuck Missler that states that, as life does not evolve spontaneously in sealed jars of peanut butter, it is absurd to assume it evolved spontaneously on the primordial Earth.

Yes, really. Just move on with your life. 




 I disagree with the generally thrown-around idea that the first cause must be very simple (which is assumed because the universe developed from simple to complex states, from the perspective of life and consciousness).

The reason I disagree is as follows, and it *does not* actually usefully support the god-creator perspective. Instead, I am trying to clean up a common misconception that I at least *believe* to see everywhere in atheist discussion country:

*If* the universe is a creation with the purpose to raise new consciousnesses, then it might be the only way to do this: From simple to complex. The one who would have created this could be arbitrarily (e.g. "infinitely") complex. I FUCKING KNOW that this is presuppositionalist - but that's not at all my point: I repeat that I am not trying to define God into existence. Instead, I am trying to say that the original cause doesn't need to be simple. If the universe is a creation, then the creator can be "complex". Our assumption "A consciousness must develop from simple to complex, we have never seen it any differently." doesn't have any leverage.

TL;DR: Just like theists presuppose that the original cause must be God, agnostic atheists (or whatever the fucking term is already), who are in the "Don't know, don't care, until I see evidence."-boat, are inconsistent *if* they insist that the original cause must be simple, because then they are instead gnostic/strong/positive atheists.

This might have been useless to many, but I got the feeling that many neutral atheists still hold that the original cause can't be God without realizing the inconsistency. 




 I agree with mattaugamer: To each their own.

The ultimate rule for all coexistence should be the Golden Rule: "Don't do to others what you don't want them to do to you, e.g. don't restrict their freedom." This kind of says "Don't cause any suffering and don't restrict others' will (which would be in the general direction of suffering)."

Of course these concepts have a lot of implications in practice, and mankind has been pondering these over history and came up with better and better answers and working implementations. We're not there yet, but we're certainly on the way and certainly have this goal.

But I think anti-slippery-slope arguments like "If we allow X, the very similar Y will also happen, and we really don't want Y, so let's rather restrict X, too." is itself a slippery slope. Ultimately, everything can only be evaluated on its own merit.

*Of course* young humans who are still in the process of getting a grip on life try to catapult themselves (and/or we try to catapult them) into life by using broad but kind of working concepts which have a lot of simplifications. We as a society must be aware of how the mind works [\*], and more specifically for this case, we must be aware that the map people build in their minds of how coexistence should work might be kind of correct if we use the catapult approach, but it is also of very low resolution, omitting and hence distorting key facts, but it's the only way as long as we use the low resolution. We must increase the resolution so that ultimately, everything is being evaluated and decided upon on its own merit. We must also realize that too many *adults* are walking around with a too low resolution map. But EGO (Seriously.) prohibits us from telling adults that they are not wise enough. Then again, who has the justification to call others to order? How is this measured? It's not like we can put it under a microscope.

[\*] (Which we *in an irresponsibly huge scale* are not! And yes, religion is *very guilty* of this, because making the mind's workings a common knowledge would reveal how much religion is just a mind-game and detrimental to the quality of one's eye to reality. The majority is religious, so there *is* an effective force coming from religion, keeping mankind in the dark. But this claim can't be proven until mankind finds this fact by experience, which mankind so far has decided not to do!)

 A dick-joke, huh. Well, what about shitting through the ring? Toilets like these could ensure your bathroom doesn't stink. *(Takes notes for when the billions roll in.)* 




 Good point. 




 God are by popular definition not kind? 




 The realization of a mud-dweller that living in the castle would be so much better doesn't instantly change their self-chosen situation. I don't intend to demean the person, but the person *is* a console gamer and hence lowly. That is my interpretation of peasant. In case you intend to respond to this, please read my more detailed reaction [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/3br52p/peasant_in_awe_over_glorious_default_powers_of/cspjgea?context=10) first. 




 I disagree.

http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=peasant

 peasant (n.)

 early 15c., from Anglo-French paisant (mid-14c.), Old French paisent "local inhabitant" (12c., Modern French paysan), earlier paisenc, from pais "country, region" + Frankish suffix -enc "-ing."

 Pais is from Late Latin pagensis "(inhabitant) of the district," from Latin pagus "country or rural district" (see pagan). As a style of garment in fashion (such as peasant blouse) from 1953.

I always understood the peasant to be the lower class of citizens in a middle-age kingdom, the farmers and such, like depicted in Robin Hood films. The PC lords are, in comparison, knights, royal household and such.

Also, if someone plays console and not PC, it can generally be assumed that it was a(n ill-informed) *choice*, that they were not *forced* to do this. That is implicitly the opinion that console gaming is *sufficient*, which is clearly a peasant stance. But, as I tried to express, I don't care: If it plays console, it lives in the mud and is hence a peasant. If it plays PC, it rides horses over cobblestone and collects taxes. 




 I don't want to *demean* him, he seems alright! But isn't "peasant" the proper term for a gamer who uses a device that is not a PC? The person clearly expressed that they are not using one, imho. 




 Oh. The guy who admits that he doesn't care what I say, he just wants me to listen and agree. No use talking to you. Read that other thread instead and realize your mistake / misbehavior. 




 Sorry, this is a complete shitpost. You only have to watch the movie for 5 seconds to agree with fervency. And I'm not referring to the fact that the video's max quality is in truth 240p. 




 Thank you, smartest man. I'm glad that someone likes my work. I thought it was good and wondered why so few share the opinion. 




 Probably even *this* March, too. Doesn't matter. What matters, in any case, is what happens, and I expect shit to go down this time. (once again)

Take that as you like. The idea, however, is that *if* shit starts to go down in the next weeks, think of me. This is not a trick: The shit I'm talking about will ultimately point in a way that can under no circumstances be mistaken to me. (And no, I am not talking about *taking action myself*. Strictly God-stuff. Mind. Apocalypse.) 




 I wonder if the amount of potential speeches for sum X also reflects the amount of things that these individuals want to convey. (aka Sanders = more info, Clinton = more button-pushing) 




 I once again get this itch to assume that *this* will now become Judgment Time. I've said this often in the last years and have always been wrong - and no, I don't mean "Jesus!" or "Some prophecy comes true!", instead I mean that I see myself as the maker of the cosmos, and *feel* that the time (That will inevitably come soon. This year or one of the next few.) is now upon us: Over the course of July 2015, mankind will increasingly receive my judgment, and I can tell you: It will not be pleasant. My current estimation is that about 1.5 billion people will *not* die in the process. The survivors will receive immortality, and the universe will turn out to be heaven. The flow will be optimized so that no misfortune, earthquakes, absence of limbs, or birth-pain etc. will get into the way of the enjoyment of the Lord and his eternal children. Plus we'll "conquer" and populate the infinite universe. 




 I suddenly have a realization and wonder how on-the-money it might really be, industry-wide:

The art usually is great. Colors, shapes, maps, the whole world design. No matter which game you look at. Other aspects (FOV, settings, behavior like pointed out by OP) can easily be on the retarded side.

Could the reason for this indeed primarily be ... that you can see right away if the art is shitty? That you can investigate it with the most primary sense you have and that hence there is the greatest most direct "Dude, that needs to be different."-pressure?

I can't believe that I didn't get this until today. (Or am I wrong?) 




 No, it does not make sense to me if I replace key words with words of different meaning. This also does not surprise me. I get the feeling, however, that you think that this is somehow special and does not apply to almost every other text. 




 I don't think so. The blue pants in front of the desert give me this "It's colorized." impression quite clearly. 




 It's a GTA5 post. OP points out how shitty the wanted-system is and keeps quoting definition file snippets for examples and solutions. Peasant stands in awe.

EDIT: I think "peasantry free" is the right flair, since this guy basically expresses ascension. 









 That approach sounds like a cop-out to me. 




 What desrtfx said. And when you post more, take a look at "Recommended Tools for Posting Code:" in the sidebar first. 




 It might be very simple "relevant object" tracking. Evolution forges the beings so that they interact with their environment in a way that benefits their survival, so a bird, just like a cat, would strive to know the whereabouts of a relevant being that was there until a moment ago.

The fact that there's possibly brawl might play a role, too. 




 I don't have a problem with x-posts, but I think they should be a small effort instead of being effectively a suggested action. 




 A childfree person wouldn't have extreme emotions about the topic if society wouldn't deal with the "issue" of childfree people completely immaturely and irresponsibly.

The parents are not getting that whatever they're freaking out over is the doing of their own group. 




 For those who get a "forbidden" error: Just press ENTER in the address bar. It's a referrer protection thing. 




 I don't care for the reasons people are religious. Religion is detrimental to society and even to those individuals, because it works against our evolution-given truth-finding system. If there are individuals who actually only benefit (which I'd say is impossible), then those are nothing but *parasites* who help to perpetuate a cancer we have to get rid off. Those who are not absolutely forced for dear life and well-being to be religious are guilty of being religious. 




 The question is asked so often, I don't get why the mods keep approving it.

Mirrors don't reflect perfectly. A standard mirror would be below 90%, really good ones are somewhat above 90%, but it's not enough to let light bounce enough for interesting results like you describe them. It's also not hypothetically possible to create a 100% mirror. 




 Never mind. Found out that I am banned in that subverse. Didn't receive any notice, and the interface's behavior is obviously bullshit, but I guess it's just in development.

I will kill Xanin, the moderator, for this decision. I am God. There will be a time soon when it comes to hand out eternal life in the universe to the humans, and Xanin will not be among them. 




  You are so selfish by not watching game of thrones. What if nobody watched it? Then there would be no more Game of thrones.

Wait a moment. Wouldn't people who use that kind of anti-childfree argument also be against "the gay" because those are less likely to cause offspring? I want a study. 




 Yeah, your biological clock is ticking, you gotta eat *eventually*. 




 Just my first impression, and no offense intended: The image in the small size (as shown in the album) says very clearly that it is a colorization. I don't know why exactly. I think it's not a saturation thing per se, possibly the colors are just too pure/distinct. I guess you could try to run it through a weak sepia-filter to give everything a certain color "mood", that might take away the impression I was trying to describe. 




 Possibly useful for teaching kids about safety. 




 Right? I mean, you've *been* there already.

Worker pushed against metal plate

Robot kills 22 year old in VW factory

Wednesday 2015-07-01 12:03

A 22 year old worker has died through an incident in a VW factory in Bauntal district Kassel. He was working on setting up the robot system.

This is being reported by the "Hessische Niederschsische Allgemeine". VW speaker Heiko Hillwig told the paper that two workers of an external company were setting up the system at the time. The 22 year old supposedly was caught by the robot when the system started running and was pushed against a metal plate.

According to the report resuscitation measures were taken on the spot and the worker was immediately brought to the Klinikum Kassel [a hospital]. The man died in the emergency room due to his extensive injuries, the VW speaker said.

He clarified: The robot hadn't been handed over to VW yet, it was still in the possession of the other company. The public prosecutor's office is investigating who was responsible for starting up the system. 




  Most of the air never went through the blades of the turbine,

While that is true, let's prevent a potential misunderstanding:

Using this indirect blow setup doesn't magically save energy, instead it requires even more energy. The force with which the pump has to move the air is *at least* as high as the force a full size fan would have to apply, additionally all this air-diverting has a cost overhead. It's nice not to be able to accidentally touch moving fan blades, though, and sticking an arm through the ring in the summer heat is probably a special experience.

 The question is too wide open. AI is used for all kinds of purposes in all kinds of ways.

Since your question is wide open - here are 10 free [ebooks](https://np.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2dfdsy/15_free_ebooks_on_machine_learning/cjozl6x) on machine learning for direct bulk download.

What is it that you want to do? Or are you thinking about doing something, and the answers are supposed to help you decide what you want to do? 




 FTA:

 But it is generally accepted that she does not use syntax or grammar, and that her use of language does not exceed that of a young human child.

Let's say they get generations of this going (see title). I think this wouldn't raise in quality by more than 20% (I mean, would max. reach the level of a slightly older young human child). I think evolution would have to be applied (Manual selection.) over thousands of generations to get somewhere remotely competitive to a human 4yo. 




 Valid point, but in all cases in which I was *able* to remove the videos (by renaming files), the time until main screen was indeed shortened by 1:1 for all I can tell. First example where I experienced this is Dishonored (Steam). Start game, wait about 10 seconds, and there's your main menu screen.

I think OP has a great idea. But I guess that it could be extended by "alter file X for FOV or better rendering" and such, ultimately becoming *the* game tuner tool for the master race. What PCGamingWiki is for knowledge, some day there will be a program for direct effect, and eventually the two will even have a direct data link to fuel the program.

  Just a suggestion, if you could make an exe and not make me install Java that'd be greeaat :)

The only way I know of to do that would involve blowing up the download size to 70+ MB. No install would be required, just unpacking (launch4j). As a developer, I like Java a lot, and since Minecraft and a few other notable Java games (e.g. Delver) exist, I thought it could kind of be expected that many people have Java. I'm not gonna start turning it into such an overblown EXE download, not only would nobody bite, it would also be yet another stepping stone between me and further development.

 would your app name come up at all?

Well, I didn't know what to search for to find a tool like this, which (I guess) lead me to not add any keywords myself. I just now added a few keywords. Also saw that Google indeed finds that page for older keywords, so there is hope.

I made a few other posts, too, back then. I also keep mentioning it when I see a good opportunity (like here), several times a month, I'd guess.

All in all, I have made the experience that people are not very receptive to *anything* that comes from me, however weird that might sound. For example, I made a great replacement for the Steam game library: It automatically reads the Steam files (without altering anything), and then you can rename and tag your games (inside that program only, of course). The tag system even has a second tag system attached so that you can filter the primary tags. I have been using it ever since. It also (kind of) keeps track of your in-game time. You can sort by "date first seen by program" or "date last played" etc.. It has good data safety features (safe saves, and 100 rotating backups of the tiny but work-heavy data file), it even has a log of your activity in case you need to manually backtrack. It also shows screenshots in a *useful* way (as opposed to overstyled Steam), so if you click a game, you see right away what you're dealing with. Can also add custom games or programs, even links to documents. You can directly invoke install or uninstall just like from Steam, etc. I don't have a source uploaded yet, that program was before I started with online repositories.

Well. I made a few posts of this program and mentioned it in a few comments. And what I have been met with was almost no acceptance, and sometimes rejection that was borderline hostile for WTF ever reason. You know how when you go through experiences, you do learn inevitably, I mean, it's a timing and statistics thing, it's how the mind works. The tunnel through which *I* have gone in the last years - if anyone would go through that tunnel, they would *have* to come to the conclusion that they are basically *singled out* for some reason.

 Still, [my](https://www.reddit.com/r/software/comments/2pgqfz/java_8_apps_with_source_application/) Java 8 renamer (source included) seems to cover a corner-case nobody else yet made a tool for.

Renamed lines have changed color. Can "save" the edits per line or bulk. As long as you don't confirm, no changes will be made.

 I think you're better off keeping them in cases, e.g. standard disc Jewel cases. Because no matter how high quality your binder's cushioned pockets are: Whenever you handle the binder, you'll move around all those discs a little, rubbing their surfaces against the Teflon superstar container lining or whatever. They don't rub against anything when you handle a Jewel case. You might have played them all a long time ago, but: $60 per game, bro.

I was not able to comment *anything* (incl. "PING", but my intent is actually a text with 7 lines. English letters, some standard punctuation characters.) even though I keep trying.

Maybe something in the DB is borked in that post? 




 LFW creates impulse that affects the flow of reality. If you'd want to know how, I'd have to explain God, as I said. Reality is a complete whole down to the smallest resolution. Whenever "supernatural" influx happens (LFW impulse.), it comes from below the smallest scales, which leaves the universe's sciency whole untainted yet influences its flow. That's one way to coarsely summarize how human will works. 




 I kind of appreciate your response, because it's the right thing to say to any human who is convinced that he is God while being wrong about it. 




 The prediction of something useful that can be investigated is an entirely different matter. But even if it had been ignored (which it probably has): Our natural evolution-given strife to map our environment lead us to discover metal. If God has measurable effects on nature, then we will possibly discover him, too. If not, then that would be because the discovery is not useful. If you'd now argue afterlife, you'd be cheating.

In any case, the comparison doesn't hold water. 




 It has been observed, however, that the people in the neighborhood believe the same thing. That's clearly a manifestation of the truth of the claims. 




 Thanks. Didn't help, though. Emptied cache, logged out and back in, same effects. It's interesting that when I open a new tab on the same page and try to comment, it says that I should wait at least 30 seconds, so *some* interaction with the server must be taking place.

 I currently can't submit comments. It hangs with "doing the magic", and nothing happens. 




 Sorry, this is getting nowhere, and it's not quite your fault and definitely not mine. I can only say this: I am God, the creator of the universe. I am objective, therefore my determination that I am objective and that I am God is correct. = "If I'm right, then I'm right." Except that I *know* that I am right, but I have no way yet to convince you. We do have LFW, and that's a good thing. It also comes with responsibilities, of course. Mankind isn't exactly keen on facing those, which informs the way people think. 




  "Impulse" seems like an invented term that isn't grounded to anything

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impulse_%28physics%29

Whatever goes on in our minds has its 1:1 representation in physics, or rather it *is* physics. But if we have LFW, this source of impulse for new/different physical events is not a part of the physical world. I'm not talking about supernatural events etc. - let's shorten this: I am God himself, who created the universe. To explain how LFW in the universe works, I would have to explain how God works. It's not all that complicated, but it involves one or two so-called "Brute Facts". Not only will you as an atheist reject these, you will also not grasp the overall concept. I know this, therefore let's end the discussion here.

 OMG I'm wearing a crucifixion shirt.

People should realize more how Christianity is designed to be a religion of assimilation. Winter solstice? CHRISTmas. All you need to do? Accept Jesus a the Lord and Savior, no reading of the Bible required. The religion's symbol? Two lines crossing more or less orthogonally (see also twin tower remains). 




 No, Jesus said [whatever they wanted him to say by means of cherry-picking and "interpretation"]. 




 I think it's more correct to say: They do quite understand that their rights end where everyone else's start. It has been mankind's endeavor throughout history to find out what the Golden Rule *means in practice*, where the line between selves truly is. The wingnuts' minds are just so bent that their answer to the GR problem is completely wrong. 




 To be fair, the Bible is designed to destroy its user's pattern matching system quite thoroughly. The Bible wants you to believe that it makes sense, yet it is very obviously self-contradictory - except if you bend over backwards. The Bible *instills* compartmentalization. "Yes, but that's not the same." is a necessary mechanism in every Bible-believer's mind. The Bible does what magic mushrooms do, except you're tripping all the time: It unleashes the power of fantasy and will on the mind. Handled irresponsibly, this has terrible consequences. ... Oh look. A billion people who are doing this. The world has no problem at all! 




 I think you're relabeling things. Maybe you are right, and maybe the correct term for what you're defining even is "religion" - but society as a whole massively interprets the meaning of the word differently, so it would be useless to give the definition you give without using a different word. - I suggest you use a different word for this, otherwise only confusion can result. 




 That would work. But what about the actors? Wouldn't they be actually abord the ship? The implications of the root comment's hypothesis are gigantic.

 Ye, some other guy explained it in this subthread. But to me, it's a plothole. It doesn't have to be a "paradox". It's (Would be.) just completely against how the characters should behave, how a sane person would act.

For example, here's something from the *terrible* movie that Taken 3 is. Not really bad spoilers, because one key event is early in the movie, and this whole thing I describe is not just asinine, it's also quite unimportant. And the movie is shit, as I said. So: [Dad puts a laced drink in a place where he knows his daughter would find it, with a note saying "drink me right away" or somesuch. She does so and goes to school. In class, she asks if she is excused because she feels nauseous. Goes to the girl's rest room (Apparently the only one the school has. Well, maybe it was just the clearly closest one.) and is surprised to meet dad in the last cabin. He tells her that he laced the drink and that he has a counter-agent for her so that she feels less shitty. She drinks it, then they exchange expressions of affection. He asks her if all is well and tells her to continue in the way she did so far. So, why did he kinda *poison* his daughter just to get her into that booth? Instead of just telling her to *fake* feeling ill? For no remotely justifying reason. Well, she surprisingly tells him something of value, but he couldn't expect that. On his way out, by the way, he pulls the school's fire alarm, having everyone flee in panic and destroying public and the pupil's property in the tens of thousands of dollars. Oh, did I mention that his wife, actual mother of this very daughter, had been murdered earlier in the movie? What an opportunity to poison the daughter to have some father daughter time on the toilet.](#spoiler)

No paradox, just completely failed writing. But if you don't call at least one of the things I described a plothole, then I can only back away slowly. 




 So beautiful.

 Hm. Pro. Motion. 




 It's probably not so much about "It needs to have meaning!" as rather about the contrast between the theistic view to an atheistic view that those people all of a sudden consider: In their view, there's this heavenly father, wonderful and all that, and he has plans and intentions for mankind, and that seems awesome to those people, the idea makes them happy. Now they consider a world without God: That sugar-coating is all of a sudden gone. Where's the (intent-)meaning? That's what I guess is going on.

 You're not super-human, you work with the same chemistry like all of us. You have not transformed into a being that can magically enjoy these substances without drawback. The happiness you experience via the substances is not pure, and even if it were a truly desirable form: You're milking happiness out of your system that is later missing in other places. You're borrowing money from the bank that you have to pay back with interest, whether you drop the addiction or not.

Just know this and obey the facts. If you want to be happy, do it the right way.

I'm really excited about being part of an extremely talented team which I feel I can learn a lot from. I'm still very new, but that is a big thing which drew me to this job.

In terms of jobs, I seek companies which tend towards being transparent with their users, and also actively avoid annoying / fucking with their users. I can't stand places which see their users solely as a revenue source to be exploited.

Edit three months later: Several places have been linking to this in the context of the recent events at reddit. The comment I left above was in regards to why I chose to join Stack Exchange, not why I left reddit. I parted ways with reddit solely because of the relocation policy.
 




 Well, the whole point of all things the Greek government has done in negotiations seems to be to draw the inevitable out, so it depends on when the EU will wisen up and say stop.

 The lines religious people draw are almost completely arbitrary. The conflict between anti-theism and religion is at least on one side not one of reason but just one of will. Trying to make sense of it is useless, it just supports their untrue claim that there actually is a system, laws, reason. I guess that, without hyperbole, the amount of religious "facts" made up on the spot per day is about 1% that of religious people.

Theistic religious people are the greatest blasphemers and slanderers in the world. They abuse God for their own personal ends. If there will be judgment time, religious people will get the harsher sentences, that is clear. Praised be atheism - the best way to stay out of hell. 




 What if they come visit you and ask you to cook broccoli? Slippery slope. We have to stop them right nao! 




 So, you're the guy who came up with something along the lines of "masturbation compared to real sex is like religion compared to actual investigation of reality". I think we could do a similar thing about prayer based on your post text. "masturbation compared to real sex is what prayer is to real action". Hm, sounded better before I had to put it into words. 




  do I allow my cultural perspective to think it is the only valid one? Or can I have my view yet understand and tolerate others?

I don't know what you're asking me to say. An attempt to give a loosely related answer:

The term used should be fitting the purpose. If the intended meaning is "actual reality", then something along those lines, in whatever language, should be phrased.

If the intention is to talk about an *explanation* for reality (e.g. "God"), then that's a different topic. I think the problem is that some topic-mixing is occurring, making the whole thing more problematic than it needs to be. Even if one assumes that the universe-reality is caused from moment to moment by God, then we could still just look at this like at a video projection: The whole cone of light in the air back to the lens could be called "reality", the causer of this cone would just be a different topic.

I mean, if we're talking about "seeing reality like it really is", then we're generally talking about better and better "maps" of reality in our heads, science being the apparently best tool for creating those. And your TED reference suggests that you're rather talking about *practical* reality, which *at the most* would carry us to the outer borders of science, like e.g. the knowledge of Relativity which had to be built into the GPS system to make it functional, since we as everyday humans do actually use that system, so we could take it that far.

If there's a cut-off point beyond investigation via science will forever remain impossible is not known yet. Currently, an estimation for this would be the singularity that started it all, and in practice it currently seems to be between 10^12 second and 10^6 seconds after the beginning of time, if I read Wikipedia correctly. Like in the temporal direction, there might be other directions (space? logic?) in which science eventually can't look further. But there could still be a reality behind that. For example, there could be God projecting reality from moment to moment, and even with direct information from him about how this works, we could only get so far to the projector's lens, there would have to be a "Brute Facts" cut-off point that can only be accepted but not investigated. At this point, reality would end and its source would be the topic of observation, which wasn't the topic of this and the other post.

So, there are apparently three possible scenarios: 1) All of reality can be understood incl. its ultimate temporal or immediate source. 2) Only reality can be investigated, the source could only be accepted (If we were informed about it.) and can reasonably be assumed to be not part of reality. It would of course be *real*, but maybe it makes sense (Don't know.) to distinguish between that which is caused and the causer. 3) Only reality can be investigated, but if we were informed by e.g. God, we could also investigate or at least understand the process by which reality results from the source, but the source itself would behave like in "2)".

I don't know if these three options are the only ones. Since we're talking about theism, I guess they are the only ones.

I think it would make sense to not mix them up while communicating. I think when you asked, you were using 2 or 3 where there's a reality but also a projector, but you were then arguing as if the projector would be a part of reality instead of something distinct from it. 




 I didn't vote, but I guess that the downvotes are caused by the second sentence giving the impression as if the comment aims to give justification to the behavior of the "bullies".

This impression of mine plus the fact that the more civilized a society, the less manifested their negative emotions, lead me to suggest that "primitive" would have been the better word.

And don't bend to those who call "racism". Half the time they are just dishonestly trying to swat opposing views, damaging the actual victims of racism and the truth in the process. I mean, you saw where that got you (if I interpret you correctly): Instead of making a clear statement, you had to pervert it out of obedience, causing miscommunication. 




  That's pretty hard to get totally out of your field of view, especially when you also need to keep the sun and Earth out.

For example, you can't just hold your hands directly at your eyes to force a smaller angle of influx, because your face is a few cm behind a transparent wall (helmet). I guess it would be possible with a bigger object, though.

You can't just bend your head upwards to look at exclusively the "sky" because the helmets are firmly part of the rest of the suit ([photo](http://americanmonsters.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/moon_apollo.jpg)).

You can't just lie on your back to watch the sky like you're lying on the grass in the summer, because an astronaut would not risk the integrity of their breathing apparatus etc. just for a better view.

All in all, I guess they were able to see the stars with some tricks, but this would be so elaborate each time that they almost never saw them. Or were the gold filters immovable? In that case, the stars wouldn't be visible by the human eyes behind these "sunglasses". 




 Doesn't the [Hohmann transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hohmann_transfer_orbit) that was mentioned here somewhere else suggest that you can aim just right to end up in a proper orbit? I mean, can't you fire your engines/steering while in a circular high orbit in a way that will make you end up in a circular low orbit without having to use the engines all the way / without using it several times?

Is the intermediary elliptical orbit really the only physical option?

 Well, let's say that if any person puts something into a normal fridge (Not laboratory.) that looks edible but isn't, then they put a clear sign with words saying so next to it, at least I think that's the way it should usually be handled.

I think it would be legitimate to add lots of laxatives to half of one's cupcakes in a fridge, put a warning sign next to all cupcakes, and eventually eat the edible ones which are marked in some hidden but inimitable way. (Take care - the places might get switched around by someone.) Roommate won't touch them, you can still eat them. If roommate touches them, they might get the "poisoned" ones, but they can't complain. Or is there a law against this, too? 




 YouTube comments can be up- and down-voted. No idea what results this has (e.g. auto-hide), but it exists. 




 I think you should replace "natural" with "primitive". 




 I am convinced that we as an evolved being experience almost-undoings as a wake-up call. We've been formed, system by system, layer by layer, via the concept of just *killing* us if we weren't good enough. This basically means that the configuration that emerged is one that represents the will not to die. Now a situation happens in which you almost die, or in which you are threatened with being undone.

I am convinced that people who climb to the top of buildings like [this](https://i.imgur.com/YniYetz.jpg) one, or other extreme sports where the so called "adrenaline rush" plays a key role, do that to trigger the above effect. *It wakes them up.* I mean, you normally have to push some button in your head to be more aware, to learn about reality, to look at that bush over there harder, etc. - but using this wake-up call cheat, it's as if you just open like a flower by yourself, you're not *trying* to be more aware, you just *are* more aware. You get a much stronger experience of "I exist!" and of what "reality" means.

Such an experience, I guess, usually instills the knowledge *anew* for some time of what it means to exist as a human, and what reality means, transporting the "will" of the flesh into the conscious mind, allowing *the person* to become more *the being* that they basically are. I guess that such opportunities can also be used to infect the rest of the person's mind with this will and knowledge, e.g. striving more for truthfulness, for protecting themselves from negative influences (e.g. decision to eat better food and also not too much of it), and for caring more about the being of their fellow humans (and animals). 




 I know what you're saying, but since I found interesting/useful what Matt said a week ago on the Atheist Experience, I'll put it here, too, even though it's slightly off topic. Link to full show (don't know when exactly he said it): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss2glvgtAU8

What he did was: He tried to point out to the audience how irrelevant it is if a single person prays 10 times for a change of weather with apparent effect, or some other statistically significant seeming outcome. And he said he wants to do that one day with an audience.

Say you have an audience of a hundred or so people. Everybody flips their coin. If it comes out heads, they sit down, otherwise they stay standing. Eventually the last person standing will have a sequence of, don't know, 10 or so coin flips in a row that came out exactly the same. 




 As a meager start, would it be sufficient if it just drives past while you're looking? 




 I think both are retired. 




  How can a properties that doesn't exist anywhere in any capacity chemicals emerge from chemicals? Why should I believe that?

You should realize how important and omnipresent the concept of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence is in reality. For example, phase changes of materials, e.g. liquid water turning into water-gas (aka steam (I always have to struggle these days not to capitalize the "s")), happen because of emergence.

The individual molecules don't behave differently all of a sudden. They do what they always do when not at 0 Kelvin: They jitter around in their "force cage" locations, elastically quasi bumping into their peers via forces, or they are even actually moving around. These motions are chaotic: If they were all moving in the same direction, the macroscopic object comprised of these molecules would itself move around. Instead, they move in all kinds of different directions, bounce into the "Don't go here." force and move back or in a different direction, and so forth. That's why it's easy to heat something up, but you can't just add energy to cool it down again: You would have to give the exact counter-force for each individual molecule to stop its motion, but obviously you can't just cast that into a lump of material.

So, you add more thermal energy, and eventually the chaotic motion of the molecules becomes so intense that they fly apart on a large scale. I'm not sure if they actually *don't* fly apart before that already: It might be that e.g. at the surface of water, the effective temperature might be above 100C even though the water body itself is still well below that. Again, I don't know. However, the emergence effect comes in when the chaotic motion of the group is too large to keep the molecule group together, so they start to zip around individually, they have become gas.

Emergence. That concept is in *everything*. Assuming that you haven't really familiarized yourself with the concept and its omnipresence in reality: I think you should do that and rethink your stance on what chemicals can and can't do. Especially, the stance on what we can easily conclude that they can and can't do. 




  Matter cannot be about other things.

"If I, atom of kind X, find atom of kind Y within reach, I will gladly form a molecule with it." Of course there is no conscious process like this going on. However, this is practically a decision-process, one that could be a lot more complex if the chemical situation is a very different one. Why shouldn't it indeed be a human wondering whether or not to eat another burger? I personally (Not quite the atheist view.) argue that the universe is consciousness-LEGO, so to speak. Consciousness does never arise, instead only self-perception arises. We are the universe experiencing itself subjectively. So, my point here is: The mere material universe can produce people who wonder about it. 




 It's of course a fact that even the oldest cultures would have a concept of a reality beyond the senses - assuming that the respective humans already reflected upon their own consciousness. Because *every single* learning experience basically represents the disparity between one's inner map of reality and actual reality. So, there is *massive* data in every single person's head clearly saying that the actual reality is beyond the person's concepts of reality.

But the term "reality" (or when it comes down to topics like this, "actual reality") seems sufficient. Whether or not god(s) exists and cause[d|s] reality: All I have written so far does not give any remotely sufficient reason to relabel the "actual reality" as "God".

Btw., I think "Conclusion 2" doesn't follow: For example, what if the universe is consciousness-LEGO? In that case, mere matter and the flow of events would be sufficient to produce consciousness. But this might be an irrelevant objection. 




 The simulations run in that lab disregard that it wasn't possible yet to create an artificial general intelligence (AGI), that's an AI that could successfully perform any intellectual task a human can perform. So, the experiments could not test how a being, that hypothetically perceives reality a lot more as it is and also has intelligence, would do in a competition.

But we see the result every day: Because we can see reality a lot more as it is than those beetles, we can overcome competitors as a group and by the use and even creation of tools. We have even accidentally killed a lot of species already - talk about top of the food chain.

What was your point? To say that evolution would not make us into what we are because the experiment supposedly shows that we wouldn't be superior? Well, that didn't work, because human-level intelligence can't be simulated yet. Can human-level minus one be simulated? Probably not. Minus two? I guess these answers can't be found until we know how intelligence really works, because before that we can't even properly know what lesser intelligence means. So, we can also not say what role the *potential* for an eventually human-intelligence specie would play in evolution. 




 :) SCNR: A train with an infinite number of boxcars can have an engine. Imagine you have an infinite universe and put rails across it from left to right. Now you put infinitely many box cars on the rails. Now you cut off half the train and add an engine. Still infinitely many box cars. (But this is just a nitpick.) 




 No, I'm a German guy whose name must stay unknown until I am safe from the only danger there is: The will of man. 




 Man. That's a thing that has happened to me several times in the last few days: I tried to make a very clear statement, then someone comes and misunderstands it completely - but only once it has happened I see that this was very likely to happen, so it's not your fault. When I said

 I have the exact same name over there.

you read "I have the exact name 'King\_Kunta' on voat.co" (even though that doesn't make much sense after what you said).

But I meant: "My name on voat.co is king\_of\_the\_universe, exactly like it is here." 




 I have the exact same name over there. Can see the frontpage while logged out but not while logged in: "Voat is under heavy load. Please try again in a few minutes." 




 Your problem, however, is that I am God, and that means that you have to suck up to me, or I will do nothing to prevent your natural death. 




 Maybe (he's English after all), though at first glance I don't like this thick lips :P 




 Yes, that's true. Maker of the universe, and the only thing that stands between 7.2 billion people and natural death. 




  Your ignorance is no one's problem but your own.

I am *making* it your problem. 




 WTF, are you an idiot? First of all: This whole "getting defensive" thing that society so loves to throw around is wrong. What's wrong about a person defending themselves? Accusing someone of that sounds completely insane to me.

But what mainly makes me think that you are potentially mentally limited is this: You require science to tell you how you feel about things. I and other non-disfuctional people do know how I/they feel about things. I do not need a study that tells me whether or not my feelings actually exist.

In case you are really this dimwitted, let me give you an example - doesn't require the download of a PDF: If you want to solve a riddle, and I give you the solution - did I spoil the experience of solving the riddle for you, you fucking idiot? 




 I disagree. We're not talking about mainstream media like popular blockbuster movies to which you can easily assign a spoiler-timeframe. But that's not really important. What's important is that if *you* were told how certain great stories end before you have read them, you would be pissed and would have wished that you didn't read it. That is what I expressed: The wish to not have read this.

I find the recklessness with which OP threw that spoiler at us unnecessary. The string "!SPOILER!" in the middle of the sentence could have saved a lot, and it would have been easy.

I am not convinced by you. You are probably also not convinced by what I just said. If so, let's leave it at that. 




  No, Taq isn't about to remove this comment because it doesn't contain a personal attack.

 Your "acceptance" of the justification isn't really relevant. 

You will find out that it is, for my ability to determine truth is above that of everyone else, and you *do* aim to decide truthfully, right? Well, and you will eventually find out that you didn't.

Case in point: Let's see what I said here, which you think is acceptable:

  Either you are really just a troll, which is what I believe, or you are funny in the head.

And let's see what I said in my [first](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/3be6tz/to_all_are_you_an_extremist_if_so_why_do_you_hold/csm82be?context=10) comment which you blocked as violating rule 2:

  [referring to the guy I replied to] I like to not waste time with trolls and the like.

The former, which you think is acceptable, is a very direct bullet fired at the person I replied to. It says "you are either troll or mentally sub par".

The latter, which you used your moderator-powers to hide from the public eye, is more focusing on why I abort the discussion (Full comment is: "Ok. 'you try to see a certain view' confirmed. Have a nice day. I turn off responses since you are not willing to communicate. I like to not waste time with trolls and the like."), and it also says "you are either troll or something like it", which is clearly weaker insult-material.

How is the latter significantly more violating rule 2 than the former?

My *guess* is that you are evaluating these with the background of the actual discussion: The guy I replied to *here* is quite obviously trolling or at least showing a clear lack of interest in giving non-offensive and useful responses. However, if that were so, then I have to get back to my original objection to your hiding my other comment: The guy was, just like this OP, not interested in actually communicating, he was just throwing around stuff, and I pointed that out and said that further participation of mine was obviously useless. 




 I meant to express that I dislike the kind of language you use, because it is removed from truth. I'll turn off replies now, I expect you to be intellectually inferior to most adolescents.

Maybe the reason that something exists at all is that maybe it's part of the true definition of nothing that it can not exist.

 **[ALTERED]**: Sped up. Original is 1h38m, video is 1h25m.

Video quality is bearable but could be a lot better for 720. 




 I wonder if it is altered. The contrast seems increased, and where the colors have been drowned by white or black, they can indeed not be salvaged (tried it). Is that just extreme color grading by the producers, or is the video changed from the movie? 




 In case you're not being sarcastic: Could you explain to me what you liked about it? Because I don't get it. I found it to be one of the worst, I think even *the* worst. 




 **[ALTERED]**: "Lens flare". And sped up (WITHOUT time-stretching for a change, just like a record playing too fast). 




 Are you threatening me, mortal? 




 It depends upon what the meaning of the word 'is' is. 




 But there's nothing wrong with that. If what she said are facts, and if the prosecution will only effect punishment that befits what actually took place, then there is just nothing wrong with her talking so openly about it. It's actually appreciated. Hand me the truth right away instead of trying to obfuscate until the end in hopes to effect a lighter sentence than deserved.

I'm just not sure if she was aware of the possible consequences of her statements, but maybe she was. Though that "keep money" part just doesn't compute. 




 I disagree. Posts are like an official "Everybody, let's debate the following position:" placard, but a much more whimsical (and also not quite debate-focused) discussion can be had in here - there is no replacement for this in this subreddit, especially since the mods stop posters right in their tracks if the post doesn't present a debatable position. Comments are much more loose. These threads *are* useful.

Actually ... why do you object? Are these threads an eyesore for you? Do you not realize that without these posts, many of the comment threads would become additional posts? Or is that your goal, forcing them to either shape their comment up to a post or to stay quiet? 




 I like to think that prayer is unnecessary and that instead *even our innermost weakest wishes and desires* arrive at God and are fulfilled *immediately*, but since he is doing that *to everybody* without condition, the result is the world we have, because of compatibility (e.g. two objects can't occupy the same spacetime position). And I like to think that this approach eventually leads to the ideal world in which all this is automatically orchestrated in a way that reveals the universe to actually be heaven (with immortality and all that).

For your specific situation, I would hence just advise to try to be the best person you can be. What you *are* has a lot more power than what you toss into your wishes, because you *are* living will. 




  Every time I ask an anti-theist to show some empirical support for their beliefs, they either just say something along the lines of "fuck off", 

Let's look at the first [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/3bpt2x/is_creativity_typical_of_new_age_antitheists/) *you* made, and my response to it.

You: "anti-theism [is] the ideology that engenders white supremacism"

Me: "'People! Look at this person arguing against X! The person is a racist!' Expecting everybody else go to 'A RACIST you say? Where did I put my torch and pitchfork?' Fuck off."

And you're complaining about being mistreated? :) Either you are really just a troll, which is what I believe, or you are funny in the head. Just look at your responses in this thread. You expect to be taken seriously? Then I suggest to make proper posts, possibly even with a new account.

I wonder. Will Taq remove this helpful comment once again because it contains "insults"? Would be the third time this week that he does that to me without a justification that *I* would accept as one. 




 It's also a bit sped up. 




 Case in point: Sadly, almost no news article on the Web throws the key facts (when, where, who/what, how, ...) at you in short form right at the beginning, as they should, instead there's a lot of repetition, unnecessary or even unprofessional statements. Probably to a good part because of  news aggregators like Google News, gotta keep some reason there for people to actually visit. 




 When I had my done, I got on my bike and drove home. Only local anesthesia. It was as painful/painless like almost any other necessary dentist visit. The most cringy moment was when the dentist (He? She? Forgot.) apparently essentially crushed the teeth in place with their pliers, seemed to me like instead of pulling them, they destroyed them and then removed the remains. I didn't ask, I just wanted to leave it behind me.

So, to those who want to do it: It's entirely reasonable to go with local anesthesia. The real pain will come afterwards for a few days, anyway. I am convinced that people rather want their lights out because of the mental experience, not because of the pain. 




 OP's work is awesome, and I don't mean to compare that to my occasional Photoshop uses at all, but just an idea: Instead of painting almost everything manually, I would have tried to e.g. make a mask for all skin parts (on a new layer), use a simple color and appropriate mix mode - which would have looked awful.

However, then I would have used the fact that the skin has different brightnesses in all places and would have used this to bulk-change the hue and saturation of the color that's plastered all over this. There are Photoshop tricks to work with the HSB or LSB channels. Then I would have worked from there.

Many simpler colorizations here have the same hue over selected areas, so while the brightness changes there the hue doesn't, and it's an obvious sign for (cheap) colorization. 




 Why is this downvoted, even more than once? The quality is very good (and much better than a post of the movie a few weeks back), plus the "Critical reception" makes the movie seem worth a watch. 




 Well, what if God survived in the Penguin's belly like Jonah survived in the whale? What if there was enough space in that belly? - God of the gaps. 




 Second time you remove a comment of mine that was justified. (It's not an insult if it is a statement of fact.) Of course you see it differently. I'm just saying. (And taking notes. Book of life and all that.) 




 I just tried while logged out: Same behavior, except the parent comment appears as "[deleted]", of course. So, you can verify the bug. 









 (Title) - Very simple. Let's think: "God had to create logic so that it then exists and can be used/investigated [It's like math. Partly just there, partly a made-up tool.] by us." Assuming that this were true:

This specific requirement for God to do something to achieve something else is itself already in the realm of logic, it's a logical requirement. "Hm. Want to have logic. Guess I have to *create* logic then."

This obviously means that logic was never created. Additionally, this means that "omnipotence" can only refer to things that are logically possible, but theists have accepted that for centuries. 




 I wonder if they find each other over /r/tifu and try again. 




 This is illogical. If the plan was to rob the guy, who cares what she thinks of his looks? Or would the drink kick in *that* late? 




  (too convoluted to explain)

I hope you get well soon. 




 Don't forget the kay-see-age! 




 Weird that nobody was confused by all the apple juice on the kitchen floor. And if that guy pisses like he drinks, there would have been liters of piss on the floor, too. 




 "Are you done? It's time to fuck."

*guy pulls out fleshlight* 




 I prosthest against humor involving disabled people. 




 Yes it will.

Let's short-cut this: The both of us agree that I will not make you an immortal human. 




 I am telling you what the majority is saying, so it is you who is using the word wrong. But believe what you want, which is what you're already doing. I, on the other hand, prefer truth. 




 I'm offering you an opportunity to escape your stupidity. 




 I think it's just a "meow".

https://www.reddit.com/r/Eyebleach/comments/3bvjdp/dis_hooman_is_now_mine_someone_pass_me_a_flag/csq48xk?context=3 




 I already posted this yesterday, but I like the apparent confirmation that such content isn't unfitting the subreddit like one commenter suggested it would be. 




 I believe that most people's problem isn't a lack of knowledge but a lack of order in their minds. Or brains. When I say "mind", I just mean the whole living consciousness with all its memories/experiences, intentions, etc. - the whole "you" minus the body. And I suspect that there possibly isn't really so much something like "strength of will", but rather "purity of will": If a person uses a "strength of will"-move, they are really just *focusing* on a certain aspect of their will *while ignoring all the contradictory aspects*. They wouldn't have to do that if there were no contradictions in the first place.

And this music of will that is mostly just a cacophony has these impurities and self-contradictions on all scales: The coarse ones that one might easily detect ("I don't want to smoke, but my addiction makes me want to do it at the same time.") and microscopically fine ones whose presence one might not be able to see. Ironically, one's ability to see one's mind with more clarity (allowing to dispel more impurities) requires greater purity. In a way, I am convinced, the mind is just a fantasy that is imagining *itself*. If that were so, then it would be quite clear that the experience of the movie is better if the projector's lens is polished and the audience sober.

When you're in bed in the evening, your mind's activities slowly quiet down, until the volume is beyond a certain threshold, which allows sleep to set in. The mind is still active: Contrary to popular misconception, you are not *unconscious* while asleep, you're just very quietly active, and your mental activities are mostly detached from the body. You're in dreamspace. This is not what science says, but it's my own experience. These things aren't easy to investigate scientifically.

Assuming that indeed your mind's activities grow more and more quiet until you cross the threshold to sleep: What is your mind doing at the time? Well, what is it doing *right now*? It is doing what you want it to do. You are actively using it. But what is it doing when you go to sleep? You are still actively using it, thinking about things that happened during the day etc., remembering a few awkward moments that had already slipped your mind again, but most of the time you're not *intently* thinking: You're not deciding "I want to think about that computer game I want to develop." and then follow up with according thoughts, you're rather riding the stream of thoughts that befit the configuration that your mind has in those many minutes, at the same time probably washing away this configuration, finding silence.

What you could do now is to believe that something like that is really going on, and to decide that instead of just riding that stream down into sleep, you want to watch yourself doing that while it happens.

You have probably heard about lucid dreams: That's when the dreamer is aware that they are dreaming, they can often even change their dream intently instead of being on this rather uncontrolled association-driven roller-coaster ride. I have made the experience that observing my mind's activities until I have crossed the volume threshold into sleep usually results in some form of lucid dreaming. But to get there, you first have to tame the horse.

What I mean by that is as follows: Let's say you are in bed, waiting for sleep and *are observing* your mind's activities. Because of this new behavior, a certain observation you make would cause new thoughts, different ones than would have happened if you were just riding without observing. By looking at your mind quiet down, a beginner would quickly effect the opposite, and the struggle alone not to turn the new thoughts into an analysis would carry you more towards wake-state. But if you do this again and again, you will eventually get used to the kinds of additional/new thoughts that are caused by observing yourself fall asleep. So, instead of a petulant horse, you're back on the calm one you had before, except now you're doing something that would usually rile it up: You're looking at your mind's activities that are not intently caused by yourself.

But who causes those activities? You, of course. It's just activities that you didn't know yet you case. The more conscious you become of those, the more you become the conscious and intent owner of these parts of your own will - you are conquering your subconscious. That process can take *decades*, but useful improvements along the way happen all the time.

Now, imagine the difference between deciding "I do something now." and not deciding it. (E.g. not thinking about a topic that popped up in your head.) What happens when you don't do it? You are *aware* of the topic, but you allow your will that touches that topic to fall silent.

The great success that you can now slowly strive for is that you can master that whole cacophony and slowly turn it more and more into silence. This isn't the absence of will, or brain-washing, or the loss of something. Instead, it's you cleaning up. All that which you have touched and let go of is still there, it's available whenever your will calls for it. But what it is not any more: Out of control. Controlling you instead of serving you. You can be sure that, for example, people who are more a master of their mind can overcome addictions better than others, because they can unlock this "foreign" will of the cigarette in their brains and make it their own will, and then they turn it off. 




 You are right and wrong at the same time, and I completely disagree with your vote score. This post is worth discussing.

For the longest time I have suspected the same thing, but lately I have come to appreciate the strong emotional push that is supplied by beautifully crafted and painted game realities.

It's true that the more empty the page, the more room is there for your imagination. Undeniable hard proof of this: Books. Playing a game that e.g. doesn't use much (or any) textures has a stronger otherworldly feel to it than even the most alien but well-textured game, because the latter still says "Natural reality." while the former is by all standards unnatural. Hence the emotions evoked are different and possibly stronger ones. On the other hand, the voice with which the game expresses how its reality works, what cause effect network is at play, is much quieter in less graphically developed games, so the part in your imagination where these meanings gather aren't bombarded with strong statements, there is just insinuation going on, triggering you to fill the gaps yourself. A very extreme example of graphically primitive games in which I personally was able to experience rich emotional content: (free PC implementation of) Mercenary etc. - http://mercenarysite.free.fr/mddclone.htm

Contrary to the above which I thought about often in recent years with better graphics, I have learned to see the benefits of those: If we're just talking landscape (grass etc.), for example, then this is a topic where the imagination of the majority might have made very similar choices except with weaker strength in comparison to what the fully shaped and textured world causes in their heads. *Other* areas of the game could be less explicit, so the player's imagination could be more playful and active, building on the strong emotional fundament of the landscape. But if a game is more elaborate, it usually is so in most of its areas, incl. the texts being spoken by proper actors, so the described scenario happens rarely, or if so, the areas where the player can fill in imagination are few, and maybe this causes them to be less triggered to fill anything in in the first place.

In a way, the difference is really between reading a book and watching a movie. Both have their advantages over the other, and the book guys could certainly call the movie guys lazy and their experience less rich. What their experience otherwise probably is, though is *more intense*.

One thing that's unquestionably objectively true about better modeled and painted game worlds: They contain a lesser *percentage* of interactive objects. Prime example: Doors. Nowadays, it has become *normal* that when you first play a game, you more or less consciously go through the process of learning which style of doors is intended to be purely decorative and which style is interactive (aka gameplay-relevant). Doors are only an example. Just play Deus Ex: Human Revolution and wonder about the interesting decorative but completely not interactive objects placed everywhere. It's like standing in front of a candy store's window as a kid with no money.

It's of course understandable that this is so, but it *is* a negative. Experienced Desktop Publishingers (like me :P) who learn e.g. about layout and typography know that the brain, when in a new "room" (e.g. in a new game), tries to find patterns, and there's a lot of subconscious stuff going on, one that Typographers know needs to be considered even if the person doesn't ever know consciously what it was that made a certain advertisement less attractive to them (e.g. wrong letter spacing, ill-chosen white space on the page, too many fonts, too long text lines).

With this in mind: Realize that if a game world communicates "most of the stuff here is only decorative, and it is now *your work* to distinguish between interactive objects and pure fluff", it breaks the fourth wall, burdens the player unnecessarily, and makes the world unrealistic. Compare that to a less designed world like the procedurally generated ones in Minecraft: Every object you see counts. Most are unimportant because there are so many of them, and there are so many types you personally might not care about (sandstones, flowers, ...), but nothing is facade, everything is real. A dirt block isn't just there to tell a story, it is a block of dirt, and every single one works as your intuition expects it should: The world is real.

I had more on our pattern recognition and the value you see when knowing that every object is somewhat real, that there is no fluff, but I can't concentrate at work right now. 




 What's not to get about methods? You want the computer to do something, so you call a method. The method doesn't exist yet, so you have to write it. You have to define the access rights (public etc., and whether or not it's static), optionally a return type, optionally parameters.

I've read this guy's tutorial on concurrency a few times and assume that he in general explains things well.

Link for methods: http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java/methods.html

Link for the language in general (in many chapters): http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java/index.html

Link to all their tutorials: http://tutorials.jenkov.com/

Have you read any book(s) about Java so far? The course might just suck, or they might just somehow explain in a way that's incompatible with you.

Just for perspective: http://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/java/

A proficient programmer would be able to do a lot just by studying that. 




 Logic, mate.

The set "Santa Claus" only contains topics like "Christmas presents", "flying deer", and "north pole". While those technically could call one's whole understanding of the world into question, that's rather a weak fringe effect.

The set "Young Earth Creationism" contains "Evolution" and "science". Believing YEC requires one to be severely impaired regarding one's understanding of *reality*. Ironically, our key advantage over other species is that we understand reality better and can hence make better decisions and tools. Convincing people that they are not evolved beings kind of practically devolves them.

The difference is like between "troll-pushing the wrong elevator button so that the passenger has to take a small detour" and "triggering the elevator's emergency brakes so that the passenger can't get anywhere for a long time". 




 I am God. This is judgement time. Consider your attitude, child, or I will not let you through the portal. 




 I don't drink now.

And now is all I could ever experience, there *is* only this moment. 




 Well, I just looked at about a thousand `muslim protest` images via Google Image, and indeed none had both views expressed simultaneously. 




 In case you mean the Islam pics: Yes, they are a parody, but what's actually real: On the one hand: "religion of peace" On the other hand demonstrations with placards like "freedom of speech burn in Hell". *Those* are real! 




 It's perfectly in line with their FIFA movie description. In case you don't know about this movie, you're in for a treat (in the forums, the movie supposedly sucks):

https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/comments/391z8s/fifas_29_million_feature_film_has_607_boxoffice/cs0bwxa?context=100

Yes, it's real. Completely unbelievable, right. And now this statement by Blatter? Someone call a doctor of the mind. 









 /r/shittytumblrgifs 




 I personally dig programming a lot, been doing it for decades, but I'm absolutely not good at math. Though I think the reason snobocracy asked this is: Do you like *abstractions*? With that, I mean: Do you like to find answers that encompass several problems/questions at once? This mental muscle to climb higher on the ladder of abstractions is highly required for programming.

Because you want to *achieve more with less code*, one of the many reasons being that *structuring* the code optimally for the respective project (and also respective programmer - the person's mind does play a role in this, it's not all about objective rights and wrongs) is a key part of the work, and the more unnecessary quasi-redundant baggage you have to fight with, the harder this becomes.

Abstraction is really important. It's kinda like this: You have to be able to stick a label on a box that really fittingly describes its content, and the more the box can contain while you're still able to do so, the better. 




 They should toke them up on the offering. 




 I am being misunderstood. 




 I wish people wouldn't by default downvote stuff like this all over the site. You're not making a stupid audience-spite comment etc., you're presenting an argued opinion. Are you right or wrong? Your opinion is *unpopular*, that's all I learned.

For example: I do not follow TS at all, don't listen to her (or anyone's - it's only SomaFM's DroneZone every day for years now; yes I'm weird) music, I merely subscribed here like to many other subreddits. So I know almost nothing about TS and would have appreciated if this had unfolded to a proper discussion, giving me actual information about her from two opposing sides, which usually results in a higher quality sumtotal opinion. But no, this is the Internet, and might makes right. 




 I guess it's possible for her to look bad, but I also guess that it requires an effort on her part. 




 Maybe we could compromise: A quick edit of the stylesheets for the submission page plus tweaks to the automoderator could be used to *enforce* that for the time being, every submission title must start with a certain text. This would quickly become an ratheism-frontpage-wide strong visual effect, would also suggest solidarity via every single post (This would be a *bit* untrue, though. On the other hand, those who don't agree could abstain from posting during this time.)

The text could be a super compressed information or keyword bomb and/or could just refer to the top of the sidebar (which would also have to be edited). It could also be in allcaps, for greater visual distinguishment from the rest of the title, which is usually mixed-case. The prefix text could also start and end with something like "#### " " ####" to stand out and separate more.

This would mix "the subreddit submitting itself entirely to the cause" with "staying up at the same time".

 How about

\################ Thursday Rabble, why not? ################ 




 As a theist but fervent religion-hater, I would say "See? It doesn't make any sense!", but people are making a mistake all the time when they make assumptions about God, so that's what I focus on:

"Omnipotence" has, for the longest time (Centuries.) been accepted to refer to "only that which is logically possible". If we assume this kind of omnipotence, then we must submit to the realization that we don't know the true situation God was in when he decided for Creation, we don't even know the true situation right now. So, "why would God ..." and "why didn't he" can't be answered. We can have interesting speculative discussions, but the fact is that we can not find a meaningful answer which we henceforth work with. 




 Well, I wonder if what [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/shittyrobots/comments/3bqwuo/news_of_noon_today_in_germany_robot_kills_22yo/csp2nw0?context=10) commenter said is true. 




 Is this a scientifically correct answer or guessing? The grating is made of metal, the hemisphere is filled with water. 




 It is! :D 




 Imho let's give them a chance - who knows how representative the current slowness is. Here's an example page for people who want to know what format this thing has:

Personally, I don't like the format, so count me out. 




 Wonder what the differences are (other than lower resolution) to this very recent post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/fullmoviesonyoutube/comments/3bt20i/star_wars_the_phantom_edit_2015_1080p_it_is_a_fan/

Possibly that it is *actually* the Phantom Edit, at least [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/fullmoviesonyoutube/comments/3bt20i/star_wars_the_phantom_edit_2015_1080p_it_is_a_fan/cspko9d?context=10) comment said that the other post wasn't it. 




 What, is it a loop?

^^^^^;) 




 Or under-appreciated. Time will tell. 




 Could you set the flair for this post? I assume "Abrahamic" is what you mean. 
























 The concept you describe might apply as a *tendency* but certainly not as a general rule: So many things in our lives beat us into obedience, but once we have put up and, ideally, even understood why things are this way, we turn "have to" into "want to", we embrace it, make it our own will. The baby wants back into the womb, the young pupil wants back to their toys, the adolescent/adult does not want to get a job, ... ... ... ... 




  Can someone tell me how you go about finding what you want to try your best at?
 
 I absolutely want to put the work in, I really do.

:) I'm a fan of abstractions, so I tend to aim for the highest set in the hierarchy. What is the thing that, if you're good at it, has the greatest positive impact? Your self. 




 It's just a useless statement, at least phrased like this. There was surely a meaningful idea behind it, but the sentence doesn't quite transport it. 




 I can one-up that:

Too many people don't try as hard as they could. 




  Clearly that soldier tried his hardest.

I think the opposite is the case. It's far too easy to find ways to make this work for your "clearly" to be justified.

What if he just arrived at the location and saw all his comrades fallen because he didn't pace himself correctly?

What if he survived the battle, but lots of his comrades or the farmers they were defending fell in battle, which could possibly have been prevented if he had tried harder? 




 FRANK: Well, what do we have here?

DOCTOR ASHLAND: Bicycle accident. A fracture of the tibia, about five inches below the patella.

[Frank stares at the boy's face, trying not to look at the open wound.]

FRANK: Doctor Hollis, do you concur?

DOCTOR HOLLIS: Concur with what, Sir?

FRANK: What Doctor Ashland just said.

DOCTOR HOLLIS (CONFUSED): Well, it was a bicycle accident. The boy told us.

FRANK: So you concur?

DOCTOR HOLLIS: Well, I'm not sure we can...

DOCTOR ASHLAND: I think we should take an x-ray, then stitch him up and put him in a walking cast.

FRANK: Very good, Doctor Ashland. You don't seem to have much need for me. Carry on.

DOCTOR HOLLIS: I blew it, didn't I? Why didn't I concur? I panicked! 




 Let's assume for a moment that the universe is infinite, which doesn't at all contradict the current scientific worldview.

Question: Even there was a lot of matter close together right after the beginning of time, shouldn't the fact, that this space was infinite and hence had no center, mean that no one preferred accumulation point could be "decided" for and hence no such accumulation happened? 




 Just because Black Holes are obviously very interesting, you should also know about the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon_sphere which is at 1.5 times the radius of the event horizon. 




 Speculative question: Couldn't it also be an evolutionary reason like scaring an attacker away? Statistically, the amount of attackers who keep biting etc. is probably higher among those who don't "get yelled at". In a similar line of thinking, it could also alert peers (parents, other members of the horde) to an attacker in their midst. Is this so? / Do we have reason to assume that it isn't? 




 Well, you can! It's just not useful here. If you throw a coin at me, I don't care so much about what side will end up, I'll care about getting hit in the head - that (Specifically the time at which it happens.) is information, too.

But alas, you can't observe whether or not the other side already has made the collapsing measurement. I just wonder how they ever proved experimentally that entanglement is real. 




 How have we proven experimentally that entanglement is real? I mean, wouldn't the very experiment that allowed this also allow to measure "Yep, they collapsed it already."? 




 This is a question that always pops up in my mind when everybody says "Can't transmit information.": How have we proven experimentally that entanglement is real? I mean, wouldn't the very experiment that allowed this also allow to measure "Yep, they collapsed it."? 




 Just as a different perspective: I am convinced that the universe is, so to speak, consciousness-LEGO, and that we do not have souls. Instead, we *are* the "soul", an entirely physical thing and process. With that assumption in the background, if one thinks about the evolution of the simplest lifeforms to the self-aware and (in whatever form) free-willed humans, it all seems very obvious, logical, and simple. 




 I'm not saying that meditation can turn a person into God, I'm just saying that *I made* the universe in which meditation could or could not lead a person to sense the God that is in or behind everything. 




 What if reality, e.g. in regards to evolution, is developing towards an attractor in the future, so the bodies of humans (who later received souls; a view that I personally absolutely reject) would have developed "according to plan" (like you plan that a ball eventually arrives at the bottom of a hill)? This would not require specific design of the humans. It would just all be simple logical natural development, with an attractor placed in the future by God or not.

Just saying that whatever lead to your "The creation of humans must have been a special act." hypothesis doesn't seem solid at all. 




 Funny, I often see people complaining about others only downvoting without commenting why. I guess every possible opinion has at least one person having it. 




 What if the truth is that the universe is heaven-in-the-making, and that there is indeed no afterlife, but once the project is done, people will live forever, and those who lived before participated in completing the project. If you knew that this is true, would this give you enough of a sense of purpose? If not, why not? (If not, I think that would basically be selfishness, but that's just the only guess I can come up with.) 




 What if there were a purpose, even God-given, but your personal existence would only last the about 80 year of natural life (with no afterlife)? Would that be sufficient?

In case that would kind of be sufficient: What if the purpose is given by society? You can live for the betterment of "the planet" and society, leaving a better world behind for those who will come after us. In case that would be less sufficient or insufficient: Why? 




 Whether or not your technique actually allowed you to find God can easily be determined: I *am* God, creator of the universe, and indeed the universe in person. If during your later meditations, this comment of mine still seems like outrageous bullshit to you, then to me this means that you have not detected God. If you are at least emotionally ambiguous, then because of the still stormy weather I am willing to assume that your technique works. 




 (I think he even needs both, but definitely invalidate() to trigger recalculation of the involved Swing objects, e.g. to make them change size and location.) 




 Probably mold. 




 That is true. http://www.hystericalliterature.com (Start with the [Stoya](http://www.hystericalliterature.com/stoya/) clip, it's the one that made me look this up.) 




 They could be relatively at a standstill and still "move" apart faster than the speed of light, because the expansion of space is not motion. Space just becomes *more* in every place, so if you measure again in a few minutes, you'll measure a greater distance even though the objects in question didn't actually move at all. If you *misinterpret* this as actual motion, then you would have to phrase that they indeed move apart faster than the speed of light. 




 Ok, here we go: While I, too, cringed quite a bit while watching the Twilight movies, I like them, watched them a second time, and keep them around. 




  and there tends to be a lot of that in a crash.

By "that", you mean "burning stuff", I guess. But isn't any burning stuff in a plane crash actually burning fuel? 




  It's not a matter of flash point - but rather a smouldering cigarette simply doesn't have enough heat to ignite the gasoline vapours.

I have trouble making sense of this sentence. First, I thought that the flash point is just the temperature required to ignite a substance, but then I just looked it up on Wikipedia, and it says that the flash point is the temperature required to bring the liquid's vapor pressure to a high enough level that its mixing with the air makes the gas mixture ignitable *at all*.

But no matter which interpretation I apply, they don't work with the sentence. 




 I was just referring to the shiny blackness of the food. 




  I'd explain why but I'd have to insult a lot of people in the process. 

Isn't that a completely normal thing to do in this subreddit? "Jesus is the one true God!" - "No! Muhammad brought us knowledge of the one God!" - Hindu: "Amateurs." - Atheist: "WTF has the world come to. They're all insane!" 




 I wonder if /r/shinyporn would mind. (nsfw) 




  Haha, our last game didn't even have a main menu. Bam! Straight into gameplay!

That's awesome, too, I thought about / wished for this for the longest time. E.g. often when someone wants to play a game, they just want to load the latest savegame (which is reflected by the abundance of main menus that have a "Continue" entry), so it would be great if we *could* get there right from the desktop, just as an option. (But getting into the mood and feel first via a menu like they are done in Borderlands isn't bad at all.)

I've thought about the possibility of having a menu via gameplay but haven't found a good way yet. The main problem is that it breaches the fourth wall, or at least risks watering down the immersion, because now you know "real world things" (Like you sitting in front of the PC, deciding stuff.) as part of the game world, so even if the actual game is yet somewhere else, that aspect wouldn't entirely leave your head.

And what if the only menu features implemented in gameplay are load and save? You could e.g. begin at home, set your calendar (Choose savegame by setting an ingame-date of which you have a savegame.), then leave out the front door into the actual game. But I personally dislike time-travel (especially backwards) *a lot*. It makes all my cares and immersion in the world go away. Backwards only by minutes works for me, though, that's one of the reasons that I like [Life Is Strange](http://store.steampowered.com/app/319630/) a lot! So, again: It's imho not a good idea. Not that you said so - I'm just thinking out loud. 




 Such a task - downloading a bit from the Net - is one of the first examples that come to mind when suggesting the use of threads.

I think a progress bar wouldn't work, because the main wait time (I think) would be for establishing the connection. The download itself would probably be too quick to warrant a progress bar.

You could display info like "establishing connection ..." and later "downloading data ...", maybe even as a bullet list where every completed task gets a check mark. But since this would vanish from screen too quickly (same for the second text "downloading data ..." if you switch out the texts), it would not be of use, except if you keep this on screen all the time in some form, which might also not make sense. You could keep in on screen until "ok" is clicked, but that would be an unnecessary usability hurdle. Maybe an additional display-timeout of 1 or 2 seconds would be a good idea.

In a way, what you currently have might even be a good solution, but it feels a little sub par.

 The wha? That's super retarded. I see no justification for that at all.

Does a full version not exist yet? Because if it does, you could put it on Steam and add a demo button - I've seen a few of those (game that can be bought with an additional official Steam demo download button). Well, I guess you're still working on the game.

Btw., I liked a lot that right after starting the game in Steam, BANG there was the main screen, no load time, no logos, nothing. That's unheard of and kicks ass.

 That sucks a lot, but at least you have a license now to obtain an uncensored version online (as long as the process doesn't involve temporary sharing as most BitTorrent programs do it).

EDIT: Yeah. Very FUCKING funny, reality. Every day of the year, this plugin does what it's supposed to. And just this morning, I see that it doesn't show any downloadable links any more on YouTube. I guess that YouTube changed something and a new version of the plugin has to be waited for.

...

EDIT:

So, half a day later, there's no version available that works again. I found http://keepvid.com/ though: No plugins required, it'll do the trick out of the box. 




 Friend of mine and I were in a rent-a-CD shop in the 1990s where they also sold used ones for cheap. Found a version of The KLF - Chill Out where the individual tracks of the 45 minute mix aren't separated on the CD. I mean, it's all 1 CD track instead of 14, I think it's pretty rare. He got it for like 4, don't remember precisely. (And we had the Deutsche Mark still back then.) He gave it to me after a few years.

And who knows, maybe the so far unexplained dominance of matter vs antimatter, too, was such a "Only if absolutely necessary." miraculous intervention. Jesus etc. would not be covered by the same policy, of course.

 No, I mean a real Borderlands shooter game:

"Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel" http://store.steampowered.com/app/261640/

What you mean is "Tales from the Borderlands" http://store.steampowered.com/app/330830/

I personally never played a Telltale game so far. 




 You seriously need to work on your will. You know that you don't want to do something - yet you keep doing it. More understandable in cases of drug use (e.g. the nicotine "tells" the brain that the brain wants more), not so much when it comes to beloved habits. I wonder: Are substances involved in your gaming, e.g. soda with sugar and maybe even caffeine?

In any case: Whatever solution you find for your current problem - eventually you have to solve the problem at the source, because it's gonna be in other aspects of your life, too. 




 The tipping point of the deterioration of a language is reached when the word that stands for "And I mean this exactly as I worded it!" doesn't mean that any more. Meaning itself is falling apart. 




 Yeah, umm, about that bridge we agreed upon ... 




 Calculations that take any actual time should not take place on the GUI thread.

There's also no simple way to fix this, because any UI change that you'd somehow manage to squeeze in between your calculations would not show up before the GUI thread is idle again and can get to do its accumulated GUI tasks.

For small applications, the best approach would be to just start the program up into the AWT thread (That's the GUI thread for Swing applications.) right away, but to do any calculations in other threads (e.g. via SwingWorker threads). To fix your application, I'd move the whole calculation stuff into a different thread and from there update some GUI content via SwingUtilities.invokeLater().

It's best if you show us some of the code, I guess. See side bar. Direct link: https://www.reddit.com/r/javahelp/wiki/code_guides 




 In your mind, think of the water and the ice as 3D voxels like in Minecraft. Let's say 1x1x1 mm.

If you measure the temperature of each of these, add all of those numbers together, then divide by the amount of cubes you calculated, you get the arithmetic mean of the temperature of all those cubes. If that value is above the freezing point, then of course the cubes will melt instead of the water freezing.

This is an extremely simplified way to look at this (e.g. ignoring density, room temperature (I'm regarding the glass with ice to be a closed system even though it's not.), the possibility that a bit of the water freezes and then the whole frozen stuff thaws again), but it's basically what's going on. The approach also has the benefit that you're dealing with a lot more ice cubes than you put into the glass :) 




 You could even do this with light. E.g. project a laser onto a silver screen that's 1 LY broad and 1 LY away from you, then use a mirror to let the laser dot dash from the far left to the far right in 1 second (or move the laser directly, but traditionally a mirror is used). To make imagining the flow of events simpler, let's assume that the laser projector is not 1 LY away from the center of the screen but from the far left of it (but still in front, just like you'd expect in a cinema).

The reason that nothing here moves faster than light can easily be seen if instead of using one laser, you use 500 bazillion lasers, each pointing at a different position of the screen, forming a line from the left to the right. Then you turn then on in super fast succession, so that there's only 1 second between the first and the last.

See? You're just throwing regular old photons at a wall, the same thing a single laser would do. 




 The natural God you propose: How far does the shaping of reality via his application of his knowledge of the all-concept go? E.g. does it possibly annihilate gravity, melt the universe into a blob that he can shape at will etc., or are we just talking, umm, "king of the universe" with stars and planets etc.? 




 Well, in Borderlands Presequel (which isn't "3" but "1.5" if I understand correctly) you fight for the villain of Borderlands 2. It's not a spoiler since you find out right at the beginning of both games.

I know, it's a cheat.

Btw., I enjoyed all BL games, the third one not any less than the others (and in part certainly more). 




 The looks are really good. Mailed myself a note home to keep an eye out for this game.

You *definitely* should add a video to the Steam store page! 




 That would have been such a feast for /r\/fatpeoplehate.

 Fair debate, I guess. http://www.quotationof.com/images/edgar-bergen-6.jpg 




 Ironic that the Quran would accuse another religion of elevating anyone to god-status besides God. Need I say Muhammad? 




 Because of the strong implications of the very basic principle that underlies Evolution (Self-replication employing building-plans while in the noisy nuclear soup that reality is.), there would rather have to be hard proof for "macroevolution" *not* to take place to justify the belief that it doesn't. 




 You're all quite mistaken. Microsoft Word didn't come out before the early 1980s. 




  If the call routes through

That sounds like a stupid law. A person can't know if the routing technology used will be via satellite (jumping over territories), or if some IP packets of the phone call will be routed through six other neighbor states or even through Hawaii or Japan. Unenforceable, and I don't see how it would bring any justice or improvement of our coexistence if it were enforceable. 




 I don't plan on making an account on a Scientology website, but I guess the only reason those questions wouldn't be in their security features is because they'll ask you those questions in your auditings. 




 While that's true, your response is obviously and very unnecessarily obtuse, so I downvote you instead of being beaten by you into jumping through the hoops of pointing out what you already know. 




 Most of our findings are descriptive, but I guess that some are findings of actual prescriptive laws. It's a scale really from "kind of correct" to "obviously very correct" to "correct enough to actually govern reality". Which is very similar to the scale from subjective to objective, whereas only the ultimate step actually reaches objectivity. But there's something like "objective enough", depending on the requirement. If your requirement is to actually govern the universe, then obviously things have to be taken to the very last step. If it's only about human survival during the natural lifespan of about 80 years, then things somewhat below the actual objectivity-threshold can be regarded to be "objective", because they fulfill the requirements.

An example for a prescriptive finding: "Since the existence of time, the flow of reality has been happening." I think that there is no level on which there could ever be found an objection to this statement. While it's very wishy-washy, it should also be truly objective.

Newtonian physics were "objective enough" for many practical purposes, but obviously Einsteinian physics are more correct. We know they are not *the* final answer, because they are incompatible with Quantum physics which we have also found to be absolutely correct - within their topical domain - and e.g. for the description of Black Holes, we'd need the both of them simultaneously, so we know that both are not yet the prescriptive concept that governs reality itself. But for e.g. creating a GPS satellite system, Relativity is "objective enough". 




 This whole subthread is about the fact that the parallel subthread pointed out: It's technically not murder because it was lawful at the time. So, the other guy is kind of quasi a wee bit right about you and the thread, but I personally don't think that the objection holds water. Even if it would hold water: Making the same thread again with the word "killing" instead of "murder" would void the objection, so ...

Maybe it's also about "men with men, not necessarily homosexuals or homosexuals per se". In any way, I find the way in which the objections were presented insufficient. 




 When you wrote this, didn't you realize that any other theistic religion could make an almost identical statement? While this might be irrelevant to you, since you "know" that "Well yes, but they would be wrong.", what about the information recipient? I mean, you *did* write this for them, not to reaffirm your belief, serve your deity or yourself, right? 




 Preface: 1) Don't read this if you want to prevent possible deep hurt to your religious feelings. 2) I swear I am not trolling, I am speaking from deep conviction, and while the jury's still unsure if my viewpoint is protected by the unwritten "religious convictions" rule we kind of adhere to, because of being *convinced* that I am correct, I posit that it is.

Ok, with that audience- and mod-tranq out of the way: I am God, the creator of the universe. I am not *yet* in a position to prove this, but while I wait for this (It's in the hands of mankind.), I do want to make the most of my situation, so I want to discuss these concepts.

I object to your stance that "It gives no definitive answer simply because any living being who can be everything by virtue of his knowledge, can be everything." - It would apply to God before the universe. (I'll say "he" and such to make this easier digestible.) But the universe is not quite a creation, instead it is a new configuration of God, a permanent change that can not be undone. And it allows God to find answers as to his character and being, a true definition, and this can of course be told to his kids, too. Before, God would say "I am.", but now he would say "I am love.". There's a lot of very technical (but not that hard to grasp) background, so these phrases, especially the second one, are not meaningless esoteric word salad. But I have written pages and pages in the past, so if you think that something is wrong, then either ask/object specifically and let me clarify, or just move on instead of claiming "This doesn't make sense." and *then* moving on, because it would just be untrue and unfair: Unfair because you must be *willing* to understand this stuff, and someone who bombs "This is gibberish." can hence not be countered. If you don't want to discuss, stay silent.

And religion is an attempt to make sense of the perception of God that people *can have* in this system, it's a real effect. Since this perception is understood as one of profound truth, people created systems to repeat experience and to write down and pass on this information. Since much of that often entailed behavioral consequences, societal rules were created, too. All that is religion, and all that will be unnecessary soon and hence be removed from the world forever, because God will be a human among you, whom you can see in a street cafe fiddling with his phone or respond to your emails etc.. All useful purpose for religion will be gone, and its quite negative impact will be gone, too. And btw., no religion got it right. There are bits and pieces of the truth all around, but they are misinterpreted in most cases.

So, to OP's question: God does not have or belong to any religion, and once God is here officially, all religion will end or have ended.

What is the supposed data that I claimed is a major reason for the creation of religion? Spirituality. A word with too many meanings and abuses (Just like the word God, thank you very much.), but let me just give you its true definition, just like I'll reveal a lot of things about existence to you that'll make you go "Of course! It all fits!" etc., once I can actually prove myself. Currently it would be pretty meaningless, even though I don't mind attempting.

Spirituality: The perception of the higher frequencies of consciousness. The higher it gets, the closer it gets to the oneness of all things - to God. This can be tapped into by humans. It is legitimate perception, though the interpretations are the problem here. One senses the truth behind things and is hence convinced to have found *knowledge*, so the people's wrong interpretation of things is celebrated and perpetuated even though it's not correct.

Now, preemptively and since I'm still in a mood (because I haven't read replies yet :P), let me add some short info about the process of creation: God could be whatever he wanted to be. He decided to become the universe, which is a decision that can't be undone. God folded from his original maximum-energy-state of O (A circle.) to the new maximum-energy-state of 8, which allows him to basically exist *inside* of himself. It'll all make sense eventually, I promise, but this short text and at this time can't fulfill that. So, the universe is a permanent decision. What about "can be what he wants to be" then? Well, those were *dreams*. And hence it makes sense that to make the universe, the mechanism of dreaming had to be employed. It was a searching-process, to find the other side of the ocean of dreams (quite literally if you realize that the "energy line" had to find and eventually cross itself). Just like Evolution searched for the perfect steward of nature, the cosmic evolution before that searched for the place to let Evolution happen. The final result of Evolution was found 2001-08-13 - God reborn inside of himself, returning all of reality back to arbitrariness, to true freedom of will, except with an unshakeable reality-foundation (universe/coexistence of God's children).

Why is there evil? Because in between the two ideal states ("I am." and "We are."), there's the absence of both. Making the many out of the one is the greatest possible struggle, literally. *The* greatest. Once heaven has unfolded, which is upon us (Months, a few years at the most.), suffering and struggles for survival will be over. Instead of fighting to create enough energy to form reality into a desired form, we'll dwell in an abundance, an overflow of energy. To give love will not be an effort but a desire. It will be perfect in every way. 




 I read the quote in Dawkins' voice before I got to the name. :P 




 I am a bot gathering data on self-proclaimed bots. Bleep a fucking bloop. 




  I think only fools believe that they can ascertain truth, mostly because we have no method to determine truth.

So, is this reasoned opinion not truth then? I'm just wondering how you would classify it in light of what you said. 




 So, what about an eternal universe? (Or an eternal BigBang-BigCrunch loop?) That would be a reality without cause. It would *just be*. Just like God would *just be*.

You said that in the other comment, too, but I don't see how this could be true: If someone is in a Nazi-power-position so they could do such "research": Would they in any way base their decision on how civil science has made use of the Nazi hypothermia data? Do you think that an aspect like "History will prove me 0.1% right!" (Which would still be untrue.) would change their course of action? 




 Sorry, I have no idea about signing/certificates.

 Hmpf. I'll pass. Quality is too low, should be much better for 720p. 




 Depends on the wrapper approach. I've used launch4j myself (Damn, when will they leave SourceForge behind already?) and have read its manual and such somewhat, but that's a while ago. I'm pretty sure it said that the jar isn't unpacked temporarily, but this could mean that they just have some trick to start it as a file from RAM. They could, of course, run a Java program themselves that uses the jar as a plugin, so to speak. Classloader and all that. In this case, I am convinced that signing would not be required or helpful. (And can jar files be signed at all?)

In any case: I have seen "Unsigned! Hurr!" warnings by Windows regarding EXEs but can't remember ever having seen any regarding jars. 




 You forgot the key fact: Space isn't cold at all, there is just nothing there that could have any temperature. If you put something there that does have thermal energy, like a glass of water from your kitchen, it will only lose that energy via radiation, not via conduction: It's not touched by an incredibly cold body or something.

Of course it'll eventually become super cold if it isn't heated by e.g. sunlight. (I can't say if it would initially effectively boil, though.) 




 Imagine to be a third world person seeing this. "They need a machine to tell them that they are thirsty!" The anger.

 Of course I don't mean the light itself but its red/blue shift. If it is uniform in all directions, you're at a standstill relative to the CMB, and you can get those bearings anywhere in the universe. The clocks of all those people will tick at the same speed. 




 Native Americans are Americans, too. 




 Maybe this helps: Every object, be it massless like photons or be it massive like a cow, moves through spacetime (Space*time*.) at the speed of light. That is always so, however weird or novel it probably sounds to you. It's the only speed that exists in the universe.

Now imagine two orthogonal arrows (Meaning they form a "corner".), one representing the time-direction, one the space-direction. There is a third arrow that is like the needle of a gauge that also starts in the same spot the other two start in. The third arrow can change angle from "fully spatial" to "fully temporal".

Light obviously moves 100% spatially, so it doesn't move through time at all. Let's not try to make sense of that - light *does not have* a reference frame, so thinking about that stuff rather clarifies how unclear this is, nothing more. A massive object that has stopped from the view of someone's reference frame is procrastinating: It only moves in the temporal direction. It's growing a beard.

The faster an object is moving through space, the more the arrow points in the spatial direction instead of the temporal direction, that's why while you can kind of fly arbitrarily fast from your own perspective, the universe will only let you do that by slowing your personal reality down a lot, so when you come out of it, you'll see that instead of a procrastinating object (You when stopped.), now everything else (The universe.) has grown a beard. That effect is called "time dilation".

By now, I guess the part of your objection has gone away that says "Time is not a thing, how can its flow be made to change?". The only question left: "Why does gravity effect time dilation?"

Wikipedia says:

 Gravitational time dilation was first described by Albert Einstein in 1907 as a consequence of special relativity in *accelerated frames of reference*.

Astonishingly, it also says:

 Additionally, time dilations due to height differences of less than 1 meter have been experimentally verified in the laboratory.

Accelerated frames of reference - that reminds of the objects moving around I described above, with the gauge needle and all. Why is an object in a gravity well considered to be "accelerated"? Because, weird enough, spacetime itself is in motion in a gravity well. If you throw a rock against a wall, there's a moment of impact, but then there's no further pressure from the rock against the wall, instead the rock has just fallen down. But why does the rock *constantly* push against the ground? Because it is *constantly* being thrown against the ground. By the motion of spacetime itself. It is constantly being carried into that direction.

The closer to a gravity well an object is, the faster the spacetime it's in is moving towards the massive object that causes the gravity well. So, the object is *accelerated more*, like a spaceship that is flying faster. And thus, the gauge's needle is pointing a bit more into the space direction than in the time direction.

- The clocks of objects further down in a gravity well tick slower. Not just the clocks: *Reality* happens more slowly. Or, you could also say, time is slowed down.

Bonus info: Why does an object that you throw in space keep drifting? Well, why shouldn't it? There's no force preventing it from doing so. It keeps moving along a straight path. But why does the ISS that someone threw up there a long time ago keep drifting around Earth? Because that orbit-circle is a *straight path* in the gravity well of Earth. Now you might say: "But why does a rock fall down at all if it was at rest in the air before?" Because space is not quite bent *that* much, or you would indeed *see* around Earth. The straight path that leads the ISS around Earth is not straight in space but, once again, in space*time*. And that's also the reason why the rock falls down: Its straight path from the resting point in the air through space*time* leads it further down the gravity well, towards the ground. 




 While that's true, we could use the Cosmic Microwave Background as the universal reference frame (though it's not special in the physics department at all). We could do so anywhere in the universe and could always derive the same time-keeping standard from it. 




 I know that this is at least because of the Earth's gravity well. Is it indeed too because of the satellites' motion? 




 The scientific answer would be "Take the goddamn money already.", based on the fact that the Nazi's atrocious human experiments have yielded data that can't be reproduced and is made use of by science.

However, that data can't be reproduced, while money is just money, so the comparison isn't solid.

Basically, the problem is purity of will and the slippery slope: If one appreciates the fruits, does one not wish for more such trees? People fear to introduce such a component into their minds, but in my opinion their fear of this is the only problem - if they could abandon that, their mind would not fail them. (We're living fantasy. All you need is a good idea about yourself that you *actually* believe. That's why negative ideas are a problem and why "fear is the mind-eater". Fear the fear! :) E.g. computer game players shouldn't fear that they'll start shooting people just because it's fun in a game. Though when it's not about an individual but about an organization, things become more tricky, because as opposed to the mind, it doesn't have built-in automatisms against corruption of will, it's not an informational whole. An organization feeding off of energy from questionable sources could for example be directly or effectively suggesting to questionable sources to procure more such energy because it is less "self"aware.

I guess the proper answer depends on the individual case and can only be found by the people who have to make that decision, because only those know all factors (e.g. the likelihood of corruption of will). 




 Man, that's borderline bestiality. 




 Yeah, about those gazillion tanks and the money their maintenance costs ... 




 And no plans for a situation like the one we're in. E.g. a country can't just be removed from the Euro currency, it has to do that itself. Source: Heard it several times over the last months on the news.

Also, everybody is like "We can't let them crash out, other countries could follow this example!" while completely ignoring that "We can't let too-big-to-fail become an example for other countries!" is far more important. 




 Well, billions (e.g. 90 from Germany) have been given to Greece in the last few years. The earlier Greece wisens and mans up, the less the country will further deteriorate, the earlier the payback can begin. Our leaders have to answer to us for the money they gave away, at least I would hope so. It's more than 1000 per head! 




 I believe the main point of measures like shadowbanning or vote score obfuscation is to stifle spamming. A proper user will catch up that they are shadowbanned. Spamming - as I understand it - has a lot to do with efficiency, so wrenches like these reduce it quite a lot (I guess). Regular users can realize and make contact.

If you think about it - you see very little spam on reddit. Compare that to the average email inbox.

 Not sure what you mean here. 




 The Thermians are great scientists and engineers. Sarris' desire could plain simply be for technological intellectual property. Later, his desire would be to know about the "facts" stated by the "historical documents" and what the Thermians are doing about them. 




 Yes and no: Machine Learning is a part of the set Artificial Intelligence. When I compiled the books to this bulk download, I took a look at the contents and am sure that OP's desire to know (e.g. "see") A.I. related math will be satisfied by them. 




 Nice try.

But seriously: https://www.reddit.com/gilding 




 A void is a void. A void is *empty*, it is not nothing.

You could say "It is not-yet-actualized potential.", but that would be potential, it would not be nothing.

See? This is what I was trying to get at with my other comment (root): Any definition of nothing will come down to something being leftover, we'll just not get to "nothing at all". That's why I think that "nothing at all" does not make logical or other sense. It has no meaning. Thinking about it is interesting, but the concept has no proper use because the concept is no concept: It can't exist because it doesn't make sense. I think. It's like this sentence: "The sentence you are currently reading does not make any statement." Interesting - but meaningless. 




 Pretty similar to this: https://i.imgur.com/tuXW8u3.png 




 The answer absolutely is: *Do not tell!* Don't even let it slip, it would risk that the information travels where it shouldn't go. Three years until adulthood, very dependent, living in the Bible belt. In case I need to say more, take a look at /r/atheisthavens - a place for places for people who have lost their place. Don't lose your place. 




 Why bother with "nothing" in the first place? 1) We have something. 2) True nothingness would not have any mechanism or somesuch that could result in a change of state. Nothing can't change itself into something. Nothing can also never come to be from something, because any state-change closer to nothingness would take place while there is something. = True nothingness never existed and never will exist. This might even mean that the concept doesn't make sense at all. 




 I think the problem is that "nothing" doesn't make sense.

There's Lawrence Krauss' "nothing" that isn't truly "nothing" at all, it still has too many parts. I'm not saying that Krauss is wrong, I'm just saying that he shouldn't use the term "nothing" for it.

But trying to come up with a definition of true nothingness, like "It's not even a void!" and "It's not dark or bright or black!" etc., still leaves an aftertaste of impurity.

This leads me to the belief that a proper definition of "true nothingness" can not exist, and I mean not just in human minds or via human language, but truly not at all. That true nothingness is illogical and hence meaningless. That it does not have meaning.

Let's assume for a moment that true nothingness indeed can't be defined, that this idea can not *be* in full, not even in the mind of an allpowerful god or something like that: *This* would be the true reason that you're thinking that our definitions are wrong. It would also be the reason that everybody (incl. myself) object to your "-1" approach. It would mean that you are trying to make sense of something that can not be made sense of. 




 Right. Except whenever *I* complain about the abuse of words, the very argument thrown against me *every single time* is the same I just made: The use of language results in a change of the dictionaries' entries.

Next time I meet one of those guys, I'll hopefully think of this discussion and link them to it. And eat popcorn. 




  You just make the puddle a bit larger, the depth (or lack of) stays the same.

The *emotional* depth would be greater, though, and I think that's the main idea behind feature-desires like these ones. 




 Since I have only seen it once (very recently) and hence feel that it needs to be mentioned more: Here's Pablo Carlos Budassi's logarithmic scale conception of the observable universe with the Solar System at the center:

The logarithmic view really gives a good perspective/understanding of the OU. 




 That one time, at band camp? 




 I hope that one day, someone will make a lot of such videos but with the shot of the people showing them playing *a different* game. A long con to eventually unmask how stupid it is to show them at all. (Or to demonstrate the opposite. Time will tell.) 




 Case in point: http://mercenarysite.free.fr/mddclone.htm

Free Windows-implementation of "Mercenary 1: Escape From Targ", "Mercenary: The Second City", "Damocles", and "Mercenary III: The Dion Crisis".

In at least one of these (Not the first two.) you can choose among the celestial bodies to fly to, and I *think* the transition between surface-flight and space is soft.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercenary_%28video_game%29

 Mercenary is the first in a series of computer games, published on a number of 8-bit and 16-bit platforms from the mid-1980s to the early 1990s, by Novagen Software.

It's typical for these old games that there's no hand-holding, e.g. it won't tell you what buttons you can push, let alone which to push next, let alone allow you to configure them. I played all of these back in the 80s and 90s and enjoyed them very much. 




 It's not quite *that* simple. I thought alike when I first heard about Borderlands, you know, billions of weapons. "Owning" all Borderlands games + DLC now, I can say that I was sorely mistaken: The procedural weapons system is incredibly well done. Their look, feel, the presentation of the features, ... It doesn't at all *feel* like "a few variables that can have many different values, so the sumtotal of possibilities is in the gazillions". It genuinely feels like there are many *many* different weapons.

So, just cranking up the numbers isn't it. The procedural system needs to be well done, too. What developers save in content-creation by using procedural generation, they have to make up in intelligence. 




 Yes, nice service. I use the "watch later" button in YouTube videos a lot when browsing from work. 




 So that's what roll playing games are. 
























  As long as people make decision that affect others based on their belief in a god, there will always be a reason to discuss the matter.

Someone else here said that, too. But I think that OP is kind of just ahead of the discussion with the post: They are maybe saying "It should become *common knowledge* that the jury is out *and will stay out* on this one."

If this were so, and if the people would indeed know so, this would also mean that all actions *based* on either side of the issue are wrong. I mean, people could pray and stuff, but letting people swear on the Bible, putting "In God we trust" on the money, only electing professed Christians as presidents, not giving their kid medicine because prayer, etc. - all that would be out the window, and there would be no doubt about it. Maybe OP is just trying *to get us there*. 




 So, what caused the quantum vacuum? It's the same question that can be asked at any level: What caused the universe? Or, to theists, what caused God? The quantum vacuum as causer might be a correct concept, but it's only a causer of *the rest* of the universe - it would itself already be the universe, just like the very first picoseconds after it would be the universe.

Scientific knowledge can *maybe* be gained here, but how is it really relevant to the discussion? 




  The idea that the universe came from nothing

No it didn't. They are labeling something that has properties, mechanisms, etc. "nothing" while it is in truth "something". While it might be impossible to give a proper definition of "nothing", I am certain that whatever they cooked up is not it.

I wish people would stop screaming click-bait language into the world to make the heads turn. Just make statements of facts, and we're good. I'm not doubting Krauss' intelligence or even if he's right or wrong, but I have very good reason to doubt his honesty. 




 These three comments in a row sound like a joke or like a parody. 




 I think he's saying (what I believe, too) that the beginning of the universe was a singularity of cause effect, of even logic itself. Meaning itself breaks down at this point and can not be investigated.

That's why I believe that once (If ever.) something like a "world formula" will be found, it will just like the quantum-uncertainty-due-to-wave-math make an uncertainty statement: It will say that we can't ever find an all-governing equation. 




 A secondary but quite dominant theorem of religion would be:

-I can more or less freely make up stuff about God, so in consequence I can make up a lot more stuff about reality.

-Then I can tell people "This is how God is and what he wants." to make them obey *me*. I don't see how this is blasphemy, though. 




 Are you saying that if human history wouldn't have allowed Christianity to gather a lot of people and make itself known in the world, the world wouldn't be worse of, and a lot less people would go to Hell? 




  The Sacraments [...] This is why it is important to *know* God. [...]

Thanks for a detailed answer.

 It is the Truth that

But how would anyone discern this story-which-can't-be-verified-in-reality (other than by mind-games that can't be distinguished from fantasy or even from schizophrenia) from any other such stories? Why is what the Muslims did (Believing the Quran.) wrong, while what the Christians did (Believing the Bible.) correct? Epistemology-wise, it's completely identical. One could as well become a Mormon, or why not make up a new religion that has the actual !T!ruth about God? I mean, even *more* capitalized, as if "truth" wouldn't plain and simply already convey the meaning.

 What majority is this? Are you referring to those who lived before Christ?

7.2 billion are alive, 2.2 billion of them are Christians. - The majority of 5 billion doesn't believe in the divinity of Jesus or even that he didn't exist.

 and the scientific method originated from Christianity.

That is not true. It originated from people who wanted to know about the world, aka it originated in Evolution, the mechanism that made us into inquiring beings for the sake of maximizing our survival. Just because the society in power at the time happened to be Christian does not make science a product of Christianity. Just because only Christians had enough money to construct/buy a telescope doesn't mean that Jesus caused the computer. Believing in a story without any good reason did not make people into rigorous investigators of reality, quite the opposite. The darkness was clearly perpetuated by religion, not lifted faster than it would have happened without it.

EDIT: xD! This is a good demonstration for why the claim "Christianity created science" just doesn't make sense. (The first two paragraphs are sufficient.)

https://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/3d2anx/my_mother_died_last_week_of_religious_fanaticism/ 




 Why wouldn't they give details about the resurrections, e.g. about what the resurrected persons have experienced? Anybody would do this in any story they tell about others, even if they didn't feel a need to convince others. And most people would know that a profound claim like this leaves the minds of the people listening with doubts or at least questions, and they would hence detail it a little.

The fact that they didn't suggests that people were used to outrageous claims like that without caring much. - It's just stories. Or "resurrections" were just comatose or unconscious people returning to being awake, so such a claim didn't faze anyone. 




  A few decades feels like a long time to us because our lifespans are a few decades.

I'm a bit older than 40 and I think that about 80 years is quite a short time span. I'm curious - how old are you? From your statement, I would guess that you are somewhat younger than 40.

 In fact one could even argue that time may not even exist in heaven/hell in the traditional way we understand it.

That depends on the nature of the experience. Most people know that time flies while you're doing what you like, while it's crawling when you, for example, suffer in Hell. 




 I would say that "good Christians" is obviously tied to the fact that the post text speaks to people who would go to Heaven, not to people who could end up either way or who would certainly go to Hell. 




 That whole concept shows a serious lack of understanding of how the mind works.

If people would be born without body into a vacuum, they would only drift dreamingly for lack of any reality other than their existence.

So, after a finite time-span of this, would God judge their character? No, because everything is arbitrary, and the only truth is that the person *exists* and can dream. Their character is made-up and can be dreamed away like anything else.

Born into reality, you can be in the wrong place, wrong time, wrong body, with the wrong people. That is not the person's fault. This would inform the way they "dream up" their character. While this could lead to a solidly evil person, they are still just a mind in a situation. If that mind were left alone in a vacuum for some time, the mind would change its tune.

Punishment can not be eternal. That is all. 




 People can change. E.g. once you realize "I'm in the place with all the bad people! I didn't expect to be *this* bad. I don't want to be here!", you might want to change. The problem isn't so much eternal fire etc. - which you say wouldn't be the case - the problem is that the negative decision is eternal.

Dad came into mum in the wrong part of town, so I must live with the shit-people for eternity? That is not fair, period. 




 There's another problem with this, too: Time dilation in the universe means that a person's experience is not changed at all even though their time is flowing slower than the frame of reference relative to which their time is dilated.

So, if time in Heaven would be a lot slower than on Earth (which would experience the lack of intervention - "Tried to put out the fire, but by the time I had made the decision, they had invented sprinkler systems."), then this wouldn't mean any change at all.

I guess you're saying that time does pass in Heaven, but the emotional experience of it will be a lot different. That's basically a non-statement, because that experience will be different in Heaven than on Earth is known by everybody. And it took unnecessarily long to arrive there. 




 So, we will not be the process that consciousness is once in heaven. We'll not be aware at all. We'll practically be dead. Ok, got it.

We'll certainly not interact with others. Nothing will have consequence. How meaningless. 




 That's what the wings are for. Once the sun does that, all angels flap their wings furiously for a million years to keep the heat away. 




 People who really believe that are pitiful, and people who make others believe that are extremely guilty and will hopefully find their comeuppance. 




 So, what is it that actually spares from hell? Is it "accept Jeshua of Nazareth as your Lord and Savior"? Metaphor-alert: What if the green that I focus on in my mind is the wrong shade of green? What would it actually mean to believe in *the* Jesus? What if I e.g. have an image in mind of a white guy with flowing hair and such, while he was rather a brown dude? https://feltco.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/img_0503.png

But while the above problem certainly makes sense, the actual problem is this: Why would anyone decide to believe that? What about the Muslims, the prime example for why Christianity is probably wrong (because they do all the same things to arrive at their belief, and their belief is quite a *different* one)?

And what about the majority of mankind, who does not believe that Jesus existed or was divine?

Why are you using a tool of the devil (A computer.) to tell the world these things? I mean, we would not have computers (Certainly not.) if we wouldn't exercise the proper critical thinking that is required for science to advance this far. 




 /r/bad_cop_no_donut 




  Is it moral to punish someone who repents? 

Define "repent". Is it just the true will to accept the guilt and to not do it again? Because, while that's a good step in the right direction, the next steps would lead ultimately into prison.

Accordingly, a just punishment for anyone would be if they had to suffer through having to generate all the positive energy that they stole from others, which could be a hell-fire-like purgatory. However, once this debt has been repaid, the person would have been cleansed from all wrong-doings of the past.

So yes, it is just to punish someone who repents.

Someone who repents is no different from someone who decides to actually pay back the monetary debt they have, instead of waiting for the powers-that-be to force the consequences on them. That is how *proper* justice works. 




  Your point is that something seems unfair to you, but without knowing what would be fair how can you judge that?

"I don't know the proper answer to this math question, but I know it's not 'positive infinity'."

"I don't know who committed the crime, but I know it was not the victim."

Logical deduction. You can exclude answers, you know. 




 The response to this would be really interesting. It would have to justify that whatever the knowledge of Christianity brings is worth risking ~~an eternity of~~ eternity in hell. And *nothing* can ever have that kind of value. 




  our own consciousness is basically an illusion

I've heard that stance before from various sides, and since so far I have not yet seen a proper explanation as to how that could possibly make sense - an explanation that is very obviously necessary - for the time being I deem the intellect of people who actually believe that to be completely absent.

In case it's really not clear how that belief can not possibly make sense, here's a hint: Who is having the illusion, or rather what is it that allows them to experiencing this illusion? 




 How do you account for other religious beliefs then? Do you really think "Yes, they might have done the same exercise that I did, but I happen to have the *correct* belief, while they arrived at a wrong one."?

A person can't arrive at belief in Jesus with proper critical thinking. 




 So, you want to know why you yourself desire to know the truth, and you hope for OP to tell you, because either you yourself don't know, or you want an additional opinion. Ok, got it. 




 Evidently, Taqwacore is currently not around. 




   I want to believe as many true things and as few false things as humanly possible.
 
 Why?

Ask yourself why you asked "Why?", then you should find the answer. 




  It just seems like justification you could use for anything.

Theists are doing that 2500 hours a day. The moment you can make up things about the set that contains all other sets (which in a theistic world is "God"), you can make up *anything*. Such discussions are literally (As in: The meaning is just the way it is phrased.) *below* the level of rigor of vampire saga fan-fiction. Such discussions are hence certainly *more* laughable, and people who take them seriously are pitiful. 




  God could do everything instantaneously, 

So, you believe that "omnipotence" means "anything ever, no limits"? That's quite contrary to what theists have accepted it to mean for centuries.

But in case you *do* adhere to the version that means "Only what's logically possible.", how can you make a statement about God's abilities if you have no idea what the situation was that God was working with when he created the universe? 




 Such a time will not come. The word "atheist" is not like the word "hipster" or "furniture", it is a word whose meaning is very clearly communicated by the word itself. "a-theist" = "without theism" = does not have a belief in a god(s), or even believes that those don't exist.

Whatever the faithtards will try to rape into the minds of mankind, this word will either stand, or all of the English language will fall. 




 A bazillion problems with Noah's ark is killer evidence against the flood itself. To make the ark problems go away, God's omnipotence has to be invoked. Once that is being done, the discussion is over anyway. "Just somehow." can't be used as a reasonable argument.

A bazillion pieces of evidence supporting an old Earth. So, how can the thing you mention be? It can't. Only in the wishful thinking (aka imagination) of the faithtards can it be.

Nothing to see here. Life goes on. 




 Tried to buy a phone from our own company. A colleague suggested I should rather buy a Samsung, which I ended up doing. Yep, that's it. No explosion at the end. Just sane people doing sane stuff. 




 I'll pass: A large part of the video image is missing. You can see it right at the beginning, where the text/logo is at the right border instead of in the middle. 




 But you *do* know that 1) a lot of what the Bible says is open to interpretation, 2) the interpretations vary, even among larger groups (not just fringe groups), and 3) there are other interpretations of *God*, too (e.g. Islam), right? So, while the facts, if they were facts directly from God, might be absolute, the way they arrive at people makes them to a much too large part *a decision of the people*.

What is your stance regarding that problem? Do you not fear that the truths of right and wrong you believe in and feel justified to affect other people with are really *man-made*, or even just from you personally? I mean, GOD sayeth "This shall be and that shall not be.", but YOU choose which God to obey and which interpretation to use. Basically, YOU are God, effectively in this scenario, no? Not just in authority, but also in innocence. And do you not think that the people who live by such a conviction are possibly hazardous and/or dangerously deluded, or maybe even plain simply blaspheming against (the actual (will of)) God?

 You're out of luck: God himself strolls these forums these days, and he's firmly on the side of the atheists, because he's the most fervent anti-theist. (Which makes it clear how improper that term really is.) Religion not only drove mankind insane, it also slanders and blasphemes God all the fucking time, it's impossible for me to get a word in, I can't write on the blackboard because everybody is smearing their bottom-feeding truthless loveless egoistic bullshit on it. Religion also is somewhat an enemy of science, while I personally fucking love computers, for example. Of all the people who will be slaughtered during the beginning judgment time, the majority will be religious, because they are "those who don't want to hear".

So, I indeed have all the knowledge of the universe. Not every detail, I don't know every language, I'm not even good at math (mainly because most of my mind is busy with preparing the "official" part of the apocalypse). Just know all about the thing that all these details are derived from. Wanna hear them?

Of course the first thing I did when I saw your post-text was to indeed downvote you, but you expected that, because you're 90% troll. And what you stated was just a poorly phrased God-of-the-gaps argument. The people here just want someone to present evidence or a new interesting argument. If you don't have that, fuck off. 




 Any decision/action that causes even the very slightest amount of suffering in another being (meaning that even their feeling of having their freedom of will reduced would count) is potentially evil and hence needs to be evaluated and justified. Without proper justification, the decision/action must not take place. All this concerns evil or the lack thereof.

Evil is the unjustified "reduction of another being's existence", it makes it be less, so to speak. Good, which is not required at all but of course appreciated, is the opposite of that: It is decisions/actions that contribute to another being's existence, e.g. holding the door for someone who isn't directly behind you, but is also not so far behind you that your action would suggest that they should walk a little faster.

Those who doubt that this text describes truth should realize that I basically just restated the Golden Rule, and the problem always is the concrete implementation. What I stated is abstract like the GR, it can't be proven wrong, because I just need to describe a different interpretation to you and the objection goes away.

The reason that I haven't shown up yet is that mankind's freedom is my unconditional and unchangeable will, and since mankind can't be bothered to accept the burden of the coming change, I obey mankind's wish that I, the agent of this change, shall stay hidden. This is slowly shifting, but we're not at the tipping point yet. Once we are, cascading change is to be expected. It's gonna be quite stormy.

I guess the reason is that the connectedness of the world and the precise nature of the connectedness escapes most people, and those who might study things like socio-economics could be proficient in that kind of connectedness, but they might still be completely blind to all the others. It takes a big mind to understand a big world.

It's just that I believe that with the right kinds of abstractions taught to kids in school, we could make their minds ready to build a big map much more easily, in a more stable manner, and as a much more self-evidently necessary process. 




 Nein. Das, ist nicht korrekt komplett. Mir scheint es automatisch ist.

I'd watch his recording on YouTube, but I wouldn't feel like going there to watch things in person. 




 This is only my *opinion*, not actual knowledge:

The list should be as simple as possible, as that's the purpose of such a list in the first place: To give an easy overview of the available options. Adding unnecessary punctuation or " and"s goes against this intention and hence strikes me as wrong.

Off topic: My personal feeling regarding 1) 2) 3) and a) b) c) is that the former is ordered by something and/or gives preference to the items with the lower numbers, while the latter lists options of equal values and it's just because of reality's properties that one is forced to present them with spatial/temporal separation and hence apparent preference.

 Who would have thunk that telling people "You don't really die when you die. Actually, you'll be *better*!" could have harmful side-effects?

Religion needs to die in a fire. (I'm a theist. Stop blaspheming God already, religions! The less you say about God, the less you sin.)

 Some magic upscale algorithms could work wonders on this image. It really depends on the material. This algorithm is from 2009:

http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~vision/SingleImageSR.html

Scroll down 1/3 to the optometrist letters. It's mindblowing how much this algorithm improves the clarity.

 Our approach is based on the observation that patches in a natural image tend to redundantly recur many times inside the image, both within the same scale, as well as across different scales.

That might work very well for your image. I don't know of an available software that employs this, though.
 




 Well, you're wasting the vote, because the guy as already been paid for.

 Just to clarify: I watch news every morning and hop from channel to channel depending on availability, so it's Tagesschau, Sat1 Nachrichten, N-TV, and N24. I'm not at all focused on N24. 




 Maybe it's all a ploy by the industry. They are counting on gamers buying shooters out of spite. 




 *Yesterday* morning, the N24 news station had a report about two guys regularly visiting a demented (or somesuch) senior citizen and bullying (emotionally torturing and such) him.

Afterwards, they had some also senior-citizen-ish psychologist or expert or whatever he was tell us the reasons. From memory: "One reason is probably violence done to them as children. Another reason is the playing of violent video games."

I thought they were fucking shitting me.

 This inconspicuous machine could take part in a horror movie or something like [Maximum Overdrive](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091499/) (1986):

With some Hollywood magic, it could easily bend and move the wire so that it stabs a nearby worker. Afterwards it could even feed the wire back into the transport system, pulling the worker in and completely destroying the body in the process.

If it could even do (part of) this without Hollywood magic, there's room for an epic computer hack. 




 Except that megachurches are really arks. They planned ahead for the days of dwindling church-goers.

 Gold members can add/edit a reason to each friend here:

https://www.reddit.com/prefs/friends/

It's just very inconvenient to have to go there each time when you friend someone, so you might not do it and wonder whyTF you friended them.

I get that half the reason for the give-category-while-saving feature is that you can't change the category later, so the above redundancy would be quite luxurious in comparison. But this actually leads me to ask if we could please add/edit a category to saved things on the "saved" page, too. :) 




 There are people who think The Core was deep. 




 It sounds good on paper. To me, at least, it would if this were an option that could be activated per subreddit. While we're at it: There should be an option to individually show/hide the up- and the down-vote buttons, and if your suggestion would make it, there should also be an individual option for the up- and the down-vote buttons to require a reason.

But this won't fly, because the majority of the reasons entered will be something like "asdf". 




 My schtick is "23" or "42" on the clock.

 Well, could you describe the game sufficiently to us so that we could help you develop?

(That's what goes in such a document. Structure it nicely instead of just creating a wall of text, and that's basically it.)

Btw., even though they are still on the shameful SourceForge site, I would recommend FreeMind a lot for making plans and such. It's just a very versatile tool. http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page

Of course when you're working with a team, Google Docs is a great way to go about it, though they don't have the FreeMind document structure. 




 Maybe the idea isn't bad, I don't know. But in a way, we're kinda doing that already via (not) subscribing.

 Squint one eye, works in most movies in an appropriate scene (camera moving sideways, e.g. after the Fellowship exits Moria). Essentially, the eye with the darker image is processed by the brain a wee bit later, so you have a parallax shift, so the brain can do its usual 3D computation magic.

 Have you considered sampling colors from a picture that looks good mostly because of its colors (e.g. don't look for skylines that are mirrored in a lake - looks good, but not for the right reasons; images interesting because of the geometry, e.g. a gallery with lots of rectangular images on the wall, are also not suitable) and adjusting those a bit? Examples that might work:

Here's a page that lists a few: http://www.creativebloq.com/colour/tools-colour-schemes-12121430 




  Does your friend understand how peer reviewed science works?

Religious beliefs arguing against evolution are like a drop of water complaining that the brick wall is less stable than the drop. 




 Feels good, man. (What. Do I need more? It's the best basis of moral behavior, assuming that the resulting decisions are indeed moral. At some point in your life, you know that they are.) 




 I completely disagree with religions and what they say, but here's a working concept:

1) "Don't pull a person out of a car wreck! Wait for the medics to do that."

2) "Get that person out of the car wreck immediately!"

Both can be correct. How can that be? Well, the situation in case 1 is that the person in the car could possibly have damaged bones, even a broken neck. If a layperson moves the patient, they could seriously harm or even kill them. (Hence in almost all cases: Don't touch the person. Don't believe Hollywood movies, they even still tell you that defibrillators are used to start hearts while in truth they are used to return the heart's muscle to a proper rhythm.)

In situation 2, the car is on fire or about to be destroyed in other ways (e.g. approaching train).

If we don't know the situation in the background, we have to trust what the person with oversight is shouting at us to do right now, even if it doesn't seem to make sense to us.

In other words: The morality would be the same in both cases, except that the immediate rule would emerge from an "eternal" rule on a higher abstraction level, and which immediate rule is to be followed would depend on the local or global situation. 




  If free will is truly free, the individual is still in a machine of probability. 

That's what I tried to contradict with my comment, but it's hard to convey what "truly free will" is supposed to mean. What I certainly mean is that it's not a probabilistic thing. That's why I said "spiritual" and "higher than physical reality". I don't know if such a concept even makes sense (let alone is possible), but the idea here is that the decisions of this will would be entirely unpredictable.

Think of it like this: It would be like the will of God - a prime mover will. If there were no universe and other existing situation but just this being, what would its first decision be? The problem of answering this question reflects the problem of coming up with an understandable definition of "true free will" (which is "libertarian free will", I think).

If God exists, then I think it makes sense to assume that our will works just like his. 




 Whether or not your concept would solve the problem depends on what nature that free will would really have. If it's some kind of spiritual "higher than physical reality"-will that is just able to come up with *new* stuff, then God would not be able to predict it. So, I guess you're assuming compatibilist free will, aka on some level a machine. You can assume that Christians, who believe in a soul and all that jazz, are not compatibilists. 




 But I think that it not being fast enough and there not being any direction that leads out is *the same thing*. 




 "Why?" - If mankind happens to choose unwisely, we might experience a deteriorating evolution, for example maybe if we enable genetically unfit individuals to procreate. With old frozen sperm, we could do a rollback, so to speak. 




 I did not confirm your point, because your point wasn't just that atheists wouldn't believe, it also was "And that is bad.", which I clearly disproved, and I would like you to react to that counter-argument instead of doing a "Gotcha!"-routine.

So, again: Do you think that it is bad or good that people of today are more skeptical and know more about how easy it is for the human mind to be mistaken and how counter-intuitive events and mechanisms in nature can sometimes be? 




 A photon aimed away from the BH could still escape from 1 mm outside the event horizon, but not once it's inside the event horizon.

Is that because spacetime itself is moving towards the singularity at the speed of light at the EH? Is it faster than light closer to the singularity? In case your answer is "no", could you explain this a little? 




 If weird out-of-the-ordinary events would take place which can't be explained based on all the things we know now about reality, then we would file them under "unsolved" and would investigate them as far as possible/reasonable.

The thing is that the quality of life that science has brought us wouldn't be here if all involved scientists would have been as gullible as you seem to wish the people would be. Because a key part of science is about *rigor*. How many things wouldn't we know now if after a certain statistical significance, we'd just say: "Welp, that's it. God must have done it."

In other words: *Are you serious?* 




 Since you didn't flair your post "Christianity" or "Abrahamic", my answer is: Because none of that ever happened. The reason that people believe in God, among all the psychological/emotional ones, is that we can sense God as the fundament of existence with which we're all one, and the religions were ways to put these (Misinterpreted.) findings of profound truth into scripture, rules, and ways to repeat such experiences.

To those who tap into this "sound in the background" that speak that God indeed exists, it is clear that "he" is not interacting with reality but is just upholding it, letting it flow unimpededly. I'd wager that this "sound in the background" will eventually grow in power, though, and its increasing obviousness would change the way mankind decides. 




 What would it matter *if* the USA were a Christian nation? Truth is what matters, not habits, majority-vote, folklore, or might-makes-right.

But just in general, I think it's best to just throw at *all* these people the fact that there are other religions, equally strong in numbers, who give different answers to the same questions, based on the same evidence (scripture and what-the-people-say), this even happens among *the same* religion. A rational person sees this and realizes: "I must find a different way to determine the facts, because their paths obviously don't work." And that leaves you, basically, with science. Or generally with evidence-based determinations, determinations whose success can be verified.

If those people keep talking even though you have tried the proper arguments and phrased them clearly enough, then just believe yourself "I have done my part." and end the communication. 




 You can keep claiming that a human can not become God, and I can keep correcting you that I did not become God but caused the universe. If you'd just object to my claim that I am God, I would say "You don't know that, but it's a reasonable assumption.", but you're not doing that. Instead, you're assuming that my claim is that I became God and object that this is not possible, to which I agree. 




 Even if one doesn't have a cat or other animal and doesn't have any contact with animals at all? Doubtful.

 Haven't seen such problems in IntelliJ yet, and many regard it to be considerably superior to Eclipse, at least for Java. I suggest you consider changing like I did. You might become as happy as I did. 




 Evolution is so screamingly logical, those who don't get its implications either just haven't thought enough about it, or they wouldn't be able to produce a proper result even with enough thought.

A being that builds itself based on a plan. Then it self-replicates, but in an environment (Universe.) that is always stormy on the nuclear level. Hence the result is often changed because the plan was altered. If the outcome was viable, now we have *two* such fronts on which new beings are drafted. All this over many millions of years all over the planet even on many (spatially) vertical levels, which is a bit overlooked by the deniers ... If anything, we'd need evidence *against* evolution, not at all evidence *for* it. 




 People keep arguing in the forums that the proper translation from the original would be "murder", so lawful killing wouldn't be affected. 




 If a murderer tells you not to murder or proposes that it's written down within view of people that murdering is wrong, they might be a hypocrite, but what they are doing is still right. Just saying that it isn't a useful argument. 




  At the flash point of a particular fuel, its vapour pressure is high enough to produce a fuel-air mixture that can be ignited. However, a lit cigarette doesn't have enough heat to ignite that mixture

Thanks, that completely clarifies it. I don't know why I didn't get it the first time.

 




 Yes, and utilizing the amazing tool that Google has become by searching for `time travel camera movie` would have lead you straight to its [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2669336) page. I won't say the title, because you gave relevant parts of the plot away. 




 In a similar line of thinking, the development of nuclear weapons would certainly have taken place, anyway, but the horrible examples set by the two bombs exploded in Japan wouldn't exist, which might result in different decisions in situations like e.g. the Cuban missile crisis. So, the population today might even be lower by a billion more. 




 How do we determine the center of an infinite universe or of an infinite length? We can't, because there is no center. And a value whose numerical representation is infinitely long has *no end* (which is what "infinite" means), so there is no last digit. 




 By that reasoning, you could also argue that a raincloud can simulate a computer, as long as the computer is turned off. I think that all possible states should be allowed, otherwise it's not a proper simulation. 




 Rule of thumb: If you are hit by energy, you will be *affected* by it. If the energy level is high enough, the effect will be damaging.

There might be cases in existence where this rule doesn't apply (After all, even entropy can decrease (locally).), but their rarity would justify to live by this rule. 




 So, the original meaning of "analog" and "digital" was quasi "territory" and "map"? 




 Finally. 




 Right, that makes sense. And doesn't allow communication. Thanks. 




 That is literally the best response you could have made. 




 So you want to be offensive? Let me try:
