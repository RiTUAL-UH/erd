 Just found this gem in the Christian Science Monitor's comments section, attributed to "Dan Henning":

"All the News media BLACKOUT with the Election FRAUD and Voter FRAUD on Dr. Paul is coming back to BITE EM HARD! Its called BLOWBACK..Dr. Paul has warned America about it but the Sheep just keep tuning into the Lamestreammedia..and take every word as gosple..guess what SHEEP? You've been had. You Tube Ron Paul or go to "the daily paul .com for Gods Sake..learn the TRUTH! Rombama aint going to win..you best open your eyes and get on the Dr. Paul R3VOLUTION STEAM ROLLER, because come Aug in Tampa Fl. you will witness something thats going to BLOW YOUR MINDS..I cant wait to be there!" 







































 "It is the hip-hop thing to do among the urban youth who play unsuspecting whites like pianos.  In the old days, average people could avoid such youth by staying out of bad neighborhoods. Empowered by media, police and political complicity, however, the youth now roam everywhere looking for cars to steal and people to rob.

"What can you do? More and more Americans are carrying a gun in the car. An ex-cop I know advises that if you have to use a gun on a youth, you should leave the scene immediately, disposed of the wiped off gun as soon as possible. Such a gun cannot, of course, be registered to you, but one bought privately (through the classifieds, for example).

"I frankly dont know what to make of such advice, but even in my little town of Lake Jackson, Texas, Ive urged everyone in my family to know how to use a gun in self defense. For the animals are coming."

 Even more importantly, how exactly does such a noble concept as "the sanctity of life" suddenly decay into the tooth-grinding rage that brands these former fetuses and their mothers as "welfare scum"?

 2012: The Year of Linux on the Desktop. 









 "Eric Dondero, Paul's estranged former volunteer and personal aide, worked for Paul on and off between 1987 and 2004 (back when he was named "Eric Rittberg"), and since the Iraq war has become one of the congressman's most vociferous and notorious critics. By Dondero's account, Paul's inner circle learned between his congressional stints that *"the wilder they got, the more bombastic they got with it, the more the checks came in. You think the newsletters were bad? The fundraising letters were just insane from that period." [italics added.]*  Cato Institute President Ed Crane told reason he recalls a conversation from some time in the late 1980s in which Paul claimed that his best source of congressional campaign donations was the mailing list for The Spotlight, the conspiracy-mongering, anti-Semitic tabloid run by the Holocaust denier Willis Carto until it folded in 2001."

 Who paid the police overtime? Which public works guys cut down the trees? Who paid for the garbage trucks to crush and cart away tents, food, bicycles, and books to a public landfill?

Is this another case of the private class privatizing the profits and socializing the losses?



 









 *By NBCs Anthony Terrell and Domenico Montanaro

CARROLL, Iowa -- Ron Paul outlined what he believed was the difference between Occupy Wall Street and the Tea Party.

Some are demonstrating, because theyre scared to death they wont get their handouts, Paul said yesterday. And the other half are demonstrating, because theyre sick and tired of paying for it. Im on the side of sick and tired of paying for it.

Paul's popularity has risen since 2008 largely because of the Tea Party. He doesn't lead in polling in any state, but he is routinely in the top three in states like Iowa and New Hampshire.*

Discuss. 




 Just curious. 









 May you find peace and rest.

 1968: George Wallace and the "American Independent" party.

1980: Ronald Reagan convinces lower-middle class Americans that they will become millionaires if only they approve massive tax cuts for multimillionaires. The multimillionaires become billionaires; everyone else: the impoverished, the lower-middle class, and the middle class are forced to eat dirt, but persist in their belief Reagan is a American saint. 

1992: Ross Perot, to be followed by his "U-nited We Stand, America" party.

1994: Newt Gingrich and the "Republican Revolution."

1998: Newt Gingrich and the Clinton Impeachment. While he presided over the impeachment trial of Clinton for getting blown by a young staffer, Gingrich was himself getting blown by a young staffers (while he was on his second wife. That young staffer's name? Callista; she is now his third wife, and evidently quite fond of shopping at Tiffany's.)

2000: Ralph Nader decides that if Ross Perot could pull 20% of the vote in 1992 and 14% in 1996 despite being a complete whackjob, *surely* he could pull 5% in every state. Nader aligns himself with the "Green Party" in hopes of winning Federal matching funds. He was very much mistaken. He doesn't break 1% in *any* state, but he takes 91,000 votes in Florida; this is enough to throw Florida to George W. Bush.

2001-2009: George W. Bush and Dick Cheney. If you don't remember the hell they unleashed, go look it up.

2008: Sarah Palin.

2010: The "spontaneous, up-from-the-grassroots" Tea Party movement. Realizing that Ross Perot won the rageful, spiteful votes of a certain segment of the American population, a motley crew of Republican political advisors, Libertarian brothers (and multibillionaires from birth,) join forces with a right-wing media billionaire to re-run the Ross Perot campaign, minus Ross Perot. 

2011: The "TeaPublicans" determine that they will "save America" by steering our ship of state directly off a cliff into a vast canyon. No sane American of any political stripe
 




 We, as Americans, realize that our National Parks belong to all of us.

The same applies to the resources under our land and under our waters.

Why, then, do we lease out our lands and water to private, for-profit corporations who then extract America's natural resources, process them, and sell the products to right back to us, the ones that owned it in the first place? Every penny they've ever generated in profit comes from the resources they've extracted

Maybe it's time we spoke up for America and Americans, rather than worshipping at the altar of the Corporatists. They take our resources for *fractions* of pennies on the dollar, and sell it back to us at a truly astonishing markup.

It's one of the greatest scams ever, and it's gone on for nearly 125 years now. We give away *trillions* to them for next to nothing. If you want to get mad about something, get mad about this. Yet, there are those among us who would blame schoolteachers for our economic plight.

We don't owe any allegiance, nor profit, nor to these private, for-profit  interests. We pledge allegiance to the United States of America, not Exxon/Mobil, nor Shell, nor BP, nor Chevron, nor ARCO. Defend these private interests if you must, but don't delude yourselves that they can, have, or will *ever* show any allegiance to us in return for what we have so foolishly given away for so long.

Perhaps we should pledge our allegiance to ourselves, and our nation. 

 




 Followed a Rachel Maddow link to Palin's Facebook page.This was the most recent comment ("about an hour ago"):

[*name redacted out of a sense of shame for hapless Facebook poster*] "why do we have to suffer because of the debt why can't we cut the aid to other countries in half? that would save us enough money to pay off the debt and would not have to interfere with medicare, medicad nor with our social security, i'm just saying who is none of the people we vote for to protect us can't see this. i am just an american of every day person and I CAN SEE THIS but no we have to suffer cause our congressmen can't do this for the american people"

 Will they go after the 12 members of the Casey Anthony jury, too? 









 A nation eager for freedom and liberty awaits your response. 









 Punishing them makes us no wealthier.

We chronically undervalue our own financial worth anyway, and it doesn't look as if any of us will be getting a life-changing raise soon.

The solution isn't to tighten the thumbscrews on Congress; the solution is to value ourselves, and the work that each of us do for ourselves and  the nation.

One Congressman's salary sounds about equivalent to what it takes to provide a good, solid foundation, provide a reasonable existence, and a path to a comfortable retirement for a family of four. Let's use that as baseline, inclusive of health care benefits and vacation time.

Why? Because we're Americans, and we not only owe it to ourselves, we have quite literally *earned* it. 

America, you've earned a reasonable existence, solid health care, a few weeks of vacation each year with the kids, and stable golden years. The question is, are we American enough to accept what we've already earned for ourselves?

Value your own worth, and that of all of your American neighbors. My life as an American is a bit worse today, because somewhere within our borders today, one of my fellow Americans died from cancer that would have been caught years ago, had it been diagnosed. One of my fellow Americans ended his life today because he can't find work and would rather die than ask for help.

We've earned it. Are we American enough to accept for ourselves and each of our fellow Americans that which we have already earned?

Let's make this Fourth of July one to remember.

If every American resolves to honor each and every one of his fellow Americans *as* an American, there is no peak we cannot surmount. It's all that's united us and saved us before, and no one's changed the prescription.

We WILL get through this, if we honor one another, and treat ourselves and one another as we ourselves would like to be treated. Our grandparents and great-grandparents proved our resilience, and we could do far worse than follow the example of those we rightfully call "the Greatest Generation." 









 They defrost and dump hundreds of embryos daily. Some go straight down the sink; others find their way into Biohazard bags to be burned.

Why all the fuss over Women's Health Clinics? Why hassle women trying to get pap smears? Why murder their doctors? Why not march with obnoxious signs on the in-vitro labs, where far more fetuses are obliterated daily?

An informational query. 









 Drug kingpins.

Think of it! Never a tax, never a regulation, never some meddlesome bureaucrat poking through your books, or hassling you over quality control. And forget about pesky firearms laws -- not only can you buy arms/weapons in any quantity you like, but you can raise a private army to use them for you against those you decree must die. 

In the realm of *truly* free markets, drug lords are king. Who are we to penalize their success? They earned it. 




 B-I-N-G-O! 




 I mean, their devotion is admirable. It's like my own private C-SPAN!

I will admit, though, that a moment or two to myself would be nice once in a while. Perfect example: after a meet-and-greet with the Jaycees this morning, I was followed into the Denny's restroom by a group of men in T-shirts, stained jeans, and mounds and mounds of facial hair. They kept talking about how Linus (the blanket kid from Peanuts?) could help us line up an account with the FedEx, something something involving gold, something about Fiats also (crappy Italan cars?) They were nice enough, maybe a little awkward socially, but seemed to be decent young fellows and dedicated to the cause of liberty. I finally sent them on their way by autographing ten or so toilet seat covers.

Well, back to it. Who knew so many of my fans were proficient in Gregg shorthand?

P.S.: left tip in doubloons. 

 














 He's the right-wing billionaire-from-birth who spent tens of millions of dollars in his attempt to destroy Bill Clinton.

The only right-wing billionaires in the news these days are the multibillionaires Charles and David Koch, who just like Scaife rose to prominence with the money that their daddies left them.

What's Richard Mellon Scaife up to these days? And as long as we're talking about pouty, greedy billionaire-by-inheritance boys, how about Steve Forbes?  




 Count me among those who say Adobe Flash is "the past." Other, far superior alternatives to Adobe Flash exist.

I've often wondered why those who hate Apple/the Mac/iOS and snidely label Apple's ecosystem a "closed, proprietary system" refuse to evolve and embrace the open standards of HTML 5. Yet, they scream like little children who've had their Popsicles stolen when obsolete Adobe Flash and *its* closed, proprietary system, a fossilized artifact of Web 0.3b, acquired via Adobe's takeover of Macromedia back in the 90s, are ignored in favor of far superior alternatives.

I really don't understand this bizarre fixation on Flash. Continuing to support Flash with all of its well-known and well-documented instabilities and security risks makes about as much sense as demanding that all programs in 2011 be written in Basic.

Seriously, *what's with this Flash fixation?*  Is it some sort of offshoot of Stockholm Syndrome? Do people believe that when Flash dies, their free internet porn will go away? [It won't.] If they even remember RealMedia/RealPlayer, did today's Adobe Flash sycophants feel the same way when Real's third-rate shit software and delivery capabilities [*Buffering . . . . . . Buffering . . . . . .* ] died from both obsolescence and user frustration at Real's utter ineptitude? Will anyone besides basement-dwellers who make drag-and-drop porn banner ads with Flash actually miss it?

Can anyone explain this? *What's with this irrational love for Flash?* You might as well demand that Apple support Betamax. 




 This is why they'll never be "pro-life."

They are "pro-birth."

There's a world of difference. 




 The Republicans can't believe it either, but they're happy to cater to these loons as long as the money keeps rolling in, and their precincts get walked.

This whole thing is irrelevant, as due to the Hyde Amendment *not a penny of Federal money has gone to abortion services in decades.*

In private, when they're being honest, the Republicans have a greater and more snide contempt for anti-abortionists than does any liberal --but because of the political support the Repubs are happy to toss them a bone once in a while. Such is this "Planned Parenthood" red herring.

 Do you guys realize that the Republicans/Koch Astroturfers are absolutely laughing their asses off at you behind your backs?

You guys think liberals think you're stupid? The Koch Republicans *know* you're stupid. What kind of fucking idiots (people who actually had their own taxes *cut* by Obama, though they believe the opposite is true) would actually go to their corporate-funded Uncle Sam cosplay rallies and scream about "socialist takeovers" because their multibillionaire masters will have to pay 2 cents more per dollar of income?

You think liberals mock you? Republicans *detest* you. They take great pleasure in grinding your faces into the shit and dirt, then tricking you into blaming the liberals for it.

Remember: the American Right uses you to do all their heavy lifting, which only serves their selfish interests while undermining yours. Do you believe they have any respect for those who would work like dogs against their own best interests?

It's a lot easier to print up ten million plastic American flags in China and pepper the crowd with a few puffy-shirted, tri-corner-hatted, out-of-work-actors shouting out Tea Party slogans mixed with misquoted Founders and "patriotize" you into doing their dirty work.

Remember, every time you see them talking about "taking America back" on TV or at a rally, ***they are all laughing their asses off at you*** the ***instant*** your backs are turned.* 

Painful but accurate analogy for you: if your personal liquid assetts are *less* than $10,000,000 and you buy into the "Tea Party" narrative, you're no different or less foolish than a black American marching in support of the KKK.

 In fact, the iPad's lack of Flash is what I would characterize as a feature/selling point. 














 The impression i've had is that iPhone/iPad software was the same OS, now iOS4, which is itself a subset of Mac OS X.

 Hackers have planted viruses in video games for smart phones running on Microsoft Corp's Windows operating system, according to a security firm specializing in mobile devices.

 You want to end illegal immigration tomorrow, Arizona?

Put a $10,000 fineper illegal, per dayon everyone who HIRES an illegal.

Whoops! Bet that won't go over too well with the Republicans who race-bait you with this issue, would it? Their buddies in agribusiness wouldn't be too happy about it, for one. 

SOPick your own fucking vegetables, build your own fucking house, mow your own fucking lawn, make your own fucking food, bus your own fucking tables, wash your own fucking dishes, wash and iron your own fucking clothes, make up your own fucking motel rooms, and [scariest of all, I know,] WATCH YOUR OWN FUCKING CHILDREN. 

My $10,000 per illegal, per day fine on *EMPLOYERS* ends illegal immigration TOMORROW, Republicans. 

Bet your Party's big-ticket donations would dry up *very* quickly, eh? And you'd lose your favorite "DEY TURK YER JERBS!" argument.

Here in America we have a saying: Money talks, and bullshit walks. So, Republicans, are you going to go after the *real* reason illegal immigrants come here? They come because they're PAID to by your major donors, who must have their cheap labor. 









 For decades, conservatives have preached the benefits of personal responsibility and explained human success or failure via a theory of Social Darwinism. By this logic, the good and noble of society rise and prosper; those left behind in society have only themselves and their lack of dedication and virtue to blame.

Conservatives have long been very free with their criticisms of others; they'll sneer at the destitute or unemployed and say, "[Ross Perot/Ronald Reagan/Chuck Norris] made it in life; that shows it's possible.  Why can't you, *loser?!* HAHAHA!"

Obama's election means only to them that they have to eat their own words.  If a black guy from a very modest background can become President, it only underscores that they themselves *aren't* President, or anything even approaching the same level of importance or prestige.

Worse still, it proves to them they don't even possess the skills or abilities to achieve such heights. It shows them they were outdone by a better educated, more diligent, more dedicated guya better educated, more diligent, more dedicated *black* guy. 

Since they are happy neither with themselves nor their station in life, Obama's achievements just serve to underscore their own personal failures. Subconsciously they apply their Social Darwinist thinking to Obama, then look at themselves; they *really* don't like the result of that matchup.

As President, Obama is on TV and in the news daily; they can't escape news, images, and discussions of him. Every one of Obama's successes only serves to underscore their own failures.  This is why they have to constantly tear him down.  It's their means of mental self-preservation.

Thus, they don't just hate Obama because he's black; they hate him because he's black and is "better'n [me.]"

Also, is it feasible to combine this setup with a composting toilet? If I can avoid opening the fridge door more than once a year or so to hose out his filth, I'd *really* like to avoid it. (I'm very self-reliant and it is going to be a *real* pain to aim the hose with one hand while manually pumping his oxygen bag with the other, especially with him hanging there by his neck/head like a baseball bat hanging in a rack.)

 Ted in 1977, to *High Times* magazine:

"I got my physical notice 30 days prior to. Well, on that day I ceased cleansing my body. No more brushing my teeth, no more washing my hair, no baths, no soap, no water. Thirty days of debris build. I stopped shavin and I was 18, had a little scraggly beard, really looked like a hippie. I had long hair, and it started gettin kinky, matted up. Then two weeks before, I stopped eating any food with nutritional value. I just had chips, Pepsi, beer-stuff I never touched-buttered poop, little jars of Polish sausages, and Id drink the syrup, I was this side of death, Then a week before, I stopped going to the bathroom. I did it in my pants. poop, piss the whole shot. My pants got crusted up."

Ted in 2013, to the media at a Las Vegas Gun Show: 

"But here is what is wrong with America today. We have a president, and everybody better write this down, and memorize this. The president of the United States goes to the Vietnam Memorial Wall and pretends to honor 58,000 American heroes who died fighting communism and then he hires, appoints and associates with communists. He pretends to pay honor to men who died fighting communism, and then he hangs out with, hires and appoints communists. He is an evil dangerous man who hates America and hates freedom. And we need to fix this as soon as possible."

 Just as Bill Clinton distanced himself from the "Jesse Jackson" wing of the Democratic Party by criticizing Sister Souljah's Black Nationalist lyrics, Mitt Romney's criticism of "ObamaCare" [a deliberate, derisive term the American Right has sought to implant as strongly negative in America's id] was designed to get the NAACP booing at him, thus strengthening the resolve of his own Party's Obama-haters. This will get Mitt Romney donations and volunteers, as well as convey a much wider message.

The Republican dog-whistle: "if *those people* think 'ObamaCare' is good, *you* should hate it, because *'morbidly obese welfare queens in new Cadillacs with 8 kids with 8 different fathers buying vodka at the liquor store with Food Stamps'*."

Just think how many thousands of times Fox News and American Right SuperPACs will run this from this moment up until the election, reference it in their blogs, and AM-spam it 24 hours a day. Look at what they did with the "New Black Panthers" clip, for example.

To deny that this was a calculated move on the Romney campaign's part would be as foolish as denying that Bill Clinton's "Sister Souljah" speech was meant to clearly separate the modern Democratic Party from any association with the rhetoric of the Extremist Left of the late 1960s. (It's important to note that most people had never heard of Sister Souljah before, or since.) Both were messages sent out to/clearly received by their respective intended multiple audiences.

 Hopefully he was able to actually learn something from it.

 Maybe they thought they could pray the play away. 




 It's a tragedy how Christian Fundamentalist extremists have managed to sully the phrase "Christian" in barely more than a generation.

"Christian" used to be a noble and honorable appellation, and in its traditional definition remains so.

However, given all of the scandals, scams, hucksterism, fraud, and extremist right-wing political activism we've seen among Evangelical Protestants in the last 30 or so years, "Christian" has picked up very negative connotations such as to imply ignorance, smug self-delusion, and false righteousness.

It should never have been this way, but there was too much money and power to be had. 


 




 The most foolish and self-destructive move the American Catholic Church ever made was to ally with frothing Fundamentalist Evangelicals on "Culture War" issues.

It's cost the Church so much in the credibility department (especially among Catholics) that I wonder if the damage can ever be undone. 




  Doctors are not really allowed to unionize

What's the AMA, then?

 "right-to-rise society"

I wouldn't be surprised if this becomes a new Republican catch phrase. I see Rove's hand here.

Remember how Rove sold GWB as a "reformer with results" and a "compassionate conservative"?

"Right-to-rise" is both alliterative and has a slight tinge of dog-whistle. 




 Hopefully this will hasten the decline of social conservatism. 




  I was interested in Rand, but my inbox got filled with requests for money.

Ever notice how Ron and Rand Paul ***constantly beg*** for that "worthless fiat currency" they so deride?

 




  I'm more of a Democrat than anything

Yep. Because Democrats always run around snarking about "SJWs" and whining about "feminists."

Everyone believes you.

 




 The LIBERTY!^TM Brigades are here! 




 If you want a similar deal, I'm sure Ron would still be willing to take your "worthless fiat currency" in exchange for it, just like he's done for all his true believers for decades.

You act in your own "informed, rational self-interest," right? Give Paul a call! I'm sure he'll be willing to work with you. He might even throw in a racist newsletter for your troubles!





 




 Ron Paul has been "consistent" in courting, then scamming money from White Nationalists and Neo-Confederates for decades (if that's what you mean by "consistent.")

This story was just pulled by the Mods from the /r/politics "New" queue as "Not US Politics." Decide for yourself if their characterization is accurate: the users of /r/politics aren't able to.

Here's the full text of the article:

In a 2010 radio interview, Frazier Glenn Miller, the man suspected of killing three people Sunday at a Jewish community center and a Jewish retirement center in Kansas, said he was interested in the tea party, voiced support for then-Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, and spoke approvingly of Ron Paul, the Texas Republican congressman and presidential candidate. In late April 2010, Miller, a former Ku Klux Klan Grand Dragon, was a guest on The David Pakman Show, a nationally syndicated left-of-center radio and television program. At the time, Miller was running for US Senate as an independent in his home state of Missouri with the slogan "It's the Jews, Stupid," and Pakman pressed Miller on his extreme views.

During the interview, Miller was unabashed about his anti-Semitic positions. When asked whether he thought the United States would be better off if Hitler had succeeded, Miller responded, "Absolutely, the whole world wouldHitler would have created a paradise on Earth, particularly for white people. But he would have been fair to other people as well." He added, "Germans are blamed collectively because of the alleged so-called Holocaust."

Not surprisingly, Miller denigrated most American politicians, but cited one positively: "If I had my way [all US senators] would be in jail right now for treason, if not hung from a sturdy oak treeRon Paul is the only independent politician, representative in Washington." He also spoke highly of another conservative: "Patrick Buchanan, he's a great man, he's a great historian, he's one of the very few journalists who has the courage to speak out against Jewish domination in the country." Miller called Howard Stern "a Jew liar." When asked whether he supported the tea party, Miller replied, "The school's still out on them. They're a new movement. I'm watching them closely. I suspect, however, they'll be infiltrated by the Jews and therefore led into defeat."

During the interview, Pakman asked Miller whom he would "elect, deport, and waterboard"given the choices of President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, and former Fed chair Alan Greenspan. Miller answered, "I like Obama more than the other two, by far." He chose to elect Obama, deport Greenspan, and waterboard Biden. Miller said, "I have a great deal of admiration [for] Louis Farrakhan," and he called Ahmadinejad "a great man" because he "has guts and he tells the truth about the Jews."

"I'm a convicted felon and I'm proud of it," Miller boasted, noting that he "was convicted of declaring war on the federal government and possession of illegal weapons." He added that Jews "were responsible for my conviction that prompted me to go underground and declare warMorris Dees mainly, he's a Jew that runs the Southern Poverty Law Center." (The SPLC monitors hate groups.)

In November 2013, Pakman had an exchange of emails with Miller in which Miller noted that he was "close friends" with Craig Cobb, a white supremacist who had attempted to form an all-white town in Leith, North Dakota. According to Miller, the two had worked together "on several White Nationalist projects, including the Aryan Alternative newspaper." Referring to the recent news that a DNA test indicated that Cobb had African ancestry, Miller told Pakman, "I can't believe a man as intelligent as you, actually believes Craig Cobb is an octoroon. Surely, you know it's just another jewsmedia fraud."

 I'm noticed that some of  the news sources the Censorship Mods arbitrarily banned (oops, *sorry,* "filtered") have been getting through.

Did the Admins have to have a little talk with that petulant crew of self-appointed authoritarian censors over at r/politics?

What say you, our dear Censorship Mods? Did those "Community Outreach" purges of yours finally catch up with you? 




 This comment was deleted on at least one other subreddit. Hopefully this redacted version will pass muster. Please give it you consideration, and add your thoughts in the comments.
______________________


In response to another redditor's query: **"What are some trends on reddit that should die?"**

Censorship.

In some reedits, censorship of legitimate news sources, users, and user comments based on the whim of rogue, self-appointed Moderators is now the norm, not the rare exception.

Yes, /u/[REDACTED] , /u/[REDACTED] , /u/[REDACTED]r , /u/[REDACTED] , and /u/[REDACTED](among others,) you Censorship Mods over at /r/[REDACTED] ban users and sources at individual whim. This has been well documented and will only become a larger issue until the Admins of reddit deal with the censorship dictates you Neo-Mods have forced upon the largest political message board on the Internet.

You deem sources "unacceptable" and they are pulled before they even hit the /r/[REDACTED]/new newsfeed.

As a redditor, I don't need some vigilante Mods deciding what is and what is not acceptable to their whim and censoring content "for our own Good." There are tens of millions of redditors, and we don't need authoritarian control over the means of our communication. We can decide for ourselves, thank you very much.

Salon is banned on /r/[REDACTED]. Wonkette is also banned. For a brief time, until reddit outrage grew too large to ignore and the Censorship Mods were forced to backtrack, Mother Jones was banned. (Mother Jones is the media outfit that broke the "Mitt Romney 47%" story, the biggest political story of 2012.) But the Censorship Mods were forced to back down when it blew up in their faces; they were made to undo their unjustified and partisan ban of Mother Jones. Other of their arbitrary bans remain in place to this day.

What sources are you not able to see, fellow reddit users, because the /r/[REDACTED] Neo-Mods have decided that they know better than you do what is and what is not news and/or politics? (Hint: more than you think.)

Reddit exists because of the free flow of information. When self-appointed guardians of what is valid and what is not seize control to impose their spiteful will by force upon an unwilling community, they are violating the very premise of reddit. This is why Admin intervention is needed: this Censorship train needs to be stopped in its tracks before it becomes a trend among other would-be authoritarian Mods.

The "Digg Patriots" destroyed digg; we cannot stand by as "Reddit Patriots" force the same fate on Reddit.

Don't let the Censorship Mods win. 





















































































































































 He said something about "primate nocturnal" or something and declared it was his natural right to devirginize my new wife.

I know he's right, because he is richer and better and smarter than me. But does anyone know what he's talking about?

This is a disappointing start to our marriage. I can't make ice in the Liberty trailer, so the Liberty champagne I had specially chilled for our honeymoon night went warm while we used the ice to keep her swelling and bruising down.

She just arrived here from abroad last week. I hope this incident doesn't skew her perspective on LibertyWorld, where the natural rights of Propertarians reign supreme, and they harvest our Flowers of Freedom at will. 









 Please share your stories. 



















 And why do they seem so happy to do so, even as they continue to lose ground every year? Is the American Right's "flag-and-eagle-porn" really that effective?

Any ideas? 



















 When did you first realize that Ron Paul was not in fact "a Champion of the Constitution" but nothing more than a Neo-Confederate grifter who exploits the paranoid fears of White Supremacists?

Did you fall for the "Hey, he's 'Grandpa Peace 'n Pot!'" rebranding that started online in the mid-2000s to cover up Ron Paul's past and his decades-long associations with the *Turner Diaries* crowd?

How long did it take you to get out of the Cult of Paul? Are people you know still in?

Please share your personal stories.  



















 That's right  it's [Ron Paul!](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7018/6560359999_b98a55fc71.jpg)

(The "official World War II U.S. Army Ammo-Holder" containing the coins is free with purchase, lest anyone accuse Ron Paul of trying to rip them off.) 


















































































































 Why or why not? 






















































 I dont know what the future holds for the Republican Party.

The Republicans, desperate to win at all costs, deliberately targeted both the malignantly ignorant, the dangerously paranoid, and all combinations thereof. This segment remains prized for both their malleability and their susceptibility to flag-and-eagle porn. Single issue voters, who will often vote in direct opposition to their own interests for the sake of litmus test issues, are really all the Republicans have left.

Beginning with President Nixon continuing right up until today, the Republican apparatus has catered ever more to these loons to secure victory. As a result, the paranoid and proudly ignorant now make up the largest segment of the Republican coalition, and traditional Eisenhower/Rockefeller Republicans are not only excoriated as "RINOs," they're viewed as prize game.

The Party now finds itself in trouble: it can no longer win national elections due to this self-cultivated demographic albatross, yet they now have no chance of winning without those voters. It's not merely a matter of their individual votes: these are the activists who man Republican phone banks, donate money, walk the precincts, and hand out lawn signs.

There really is no place for a sensible American conservative to seek shelter these days. The Libertarians are even more tied to the extremist American Right and its bizarre "black helicopter" conspiracy fantasies than the Republicans are, so there is really no refuge for a sane Republican moderate.
 




















































































 Mynd you, moose bites Kan be pretty nasti... 




 Cliven Bundy has a thing or two he'd like to let you know. 









 And that a right to healthcare is slavery... oh wait 




 Strong Neo-Confederate sympathies are a very common trait among backers of the Paul Family.

 




 No, it was a deliberate word choice on the part of the poster.

He's a right-wing troll who sometimes instead tries to imitate what he thinks "those damn lib'ruls" sound like. 




 Not nearly as good as starting with the "Department of Defense." 




  Rand Paul deserves enormous credit for his actions particularly when you consider he's going against many in his own party

So Rand deserves "enormous credit" for being a member of a Party full of morons? Those are some pretty low standards of which to be proud.

 




 And yet, the Republicans have been getting away with selling ignorance as a virtue since the Reagan years. 




 Sounds like Santorum's ready to work himself into a froth. 




 Until the rent-seekers rape it out of the workers again.

Extortion from captives is neither "freedom" nor "liberty," unless you belong to the permanent leisure class of exploiters.

Americans need to stop voting for the permanent leisure class, and start voting for their own interests.  




 They tried to conceal the snaps where the hairpiece is attached. 




 It's simple, as in "Josh dug her  and her, and her, and her, and her, too!"

Also: rhymes with "bugger." 




 Seriously, though, read *The Jungle.* 




 And not enough Banksters. 




 In before self-aggrandizing dimwits posting mises/lew rockwell spam! 




 You'd think that Conservatives would be keenly interested in *conservation.*

This leads us to the question: What are Conservatives conserving, exactly? 




 So Jesus wants us all to be wage slaves to the Tyrants of Capital? 




 The social and economic damage that Fundamentalist Evangelical Christianity has inflicted upon America for the past four decades is incalculable.

Will the Reign of Terror and Error of these Censorship Mods ever end? 




 As you can see from the link below, the Censorship Mods just pulled a statement from the President as "Off Topic -- Not US Politics."

http://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/37yy5y/statement_by_the_president_on_the_passing_of_beau/ 




 They killed it!

I think it's because the Censorship Mods must really love "LIBERTY!"^TM 




 This is a statement from the President of the United States, and it's "Off Topic -- Not US Politics"???!?!?

How do you people look in the mirror? 




 And of course, it doesn't hurt that Koch Industries is headquartered in Kansas... 




 Let's see if the Censorship Mods delete a statement from the President as "Not US Politics." 









 Don't forget the right-wing Supreme Court which installed Dubya in the Oval Office.  




 The conservatives of today's era are also Royalists, but this time of Capital. 




 "The Party of Personal Responsibility" 




 TL;DR: "It's the damn liberals' fault!"
 




 The Church has been so hyperfocused/misfocused on pushing right-wing extremism at the expense of the more traditional "Good Works" that they've alienated the last several generations of would-be Catholics. 

Catholics, despite what the American branch of the Church seems to think, just don't want to hear about the evils of abortion and birth control every damn week. If people want to hear that sort of shit, they'd go to some Evangelical Protestant Duggar-esqe "Born-Again" megachurch where all intellect is checked at the door.

This is why children and grandchildren of Catholics just don't go/donate anymore. 




 "We should simply end this illegal program, just like my son should stop assaulting flight attendants and getting into drunken crashes." 




 I think it's because he's so "pro-life." 




 Note also the Right's "Colleges are just liberal indoctrination centers!!1!" meme-lie so popular among the Fox/AM propagandists.  




 Jack Hunter is not racist though.

[Sure about that?](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/07/09/rand-paul-staffer-southern-avenger/2502637/)

Also, what does [this picture of Jack Hunter and his "Southern Avenger" outfit](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/YhKjH9pQno0/hqdefault.jpg) indicate to you? 




 About two years ago a gang of extremist right-wing "Censorship Mods" took over. Anything that these Censorship Mods disagreed with (i.e., showed the American Right for what it truly is) was marked "Not US Politics," "Off Topic" or "Rehosted Content." Many news sources (along with any redditors who dared to disagree with the Censorship Mod's fiats) were often banned summarily.

They even banned "Mother Jones" for a while (for the crime of breaking the "Mitt Romney 47%" story,) but the outcry was so great that they were forced to relent.

Within the last month or so, three of the most offensive and blatant "Censorship Mods" were bounced, as they should have been long ago. Their legacy remains, however.
 




 Right-wingers have a persecution complex. 




  "fighting for our freedom."

Whenever this phrase is uttered, the "Bullshit!" alarm of perceptive students of history and politics goes off.
 




 Given the Paul Family's longstanding affiliations with White Supremacists and Neo-Confederates such as Jack Hunter (the self-dubbed "Southern Avenger" who co-authored a Tea Party book with Rand and thinks that "Lincoln was a Tyrant!!1!" and that John Wilkes Booth was a hero) I tremble to think what kind of Supreme Court Justices that Rand would appoint.

That's reason enough *alone* to completely discount Rand's candidacy. 




 Let's not forget the Paul Family's decades-long ties to White Supremacists and Neo-Confederates, either.

The last thing America needs is a return to the 19th century. 




 "And then I will force a MONEYBOMB!!!"

 Because Josh dug her, and her, her, her, and her, too! 




 I wonder if American Catholics differ significantly based on region? 




 Wonkette has a good summary of just about every incident in American politics. It's a shame it's banned from this subreddit.
 




 The "forced birth" crowd is losing influence rapidly. 




 Because they're cranks, and their base is mostly made up of stoners who know little/nothing about them.

Don't forget about the White Supremacists and Neo-Confederates that have always followed the Pauls around like puppy dogs. 




 The born-again Christians would have him re-crucified within a week. 




 They should market it as Shamu water.

 Whenever right-wingers try to do humor, they just wind up embarrassing themselves.
 




 I guess now we know what the "Hastert Rule" really means. 




 First, stalk and shoot your victim. Beforehand, trail him slowly in your car for several minutes, then get out and follow him on foot. It helps a LOT if your victim is ... well, you know.

Then, plant some Skittles and Arizona Iced Tea on the body. Whack the back of your head on the pavement so you can claim he attacked you, thus violating the Non-Aggression Principle, and thereby allowing you to act in your full, reasonable, rational self-interest by plugging him one right in the heart. Tell everyone he started it, and that you were only acting in self-defense! After all, you're just the friendly Neighborhood Watch guy.

Not only did you get to live out the "I Thrill-Killed a Violent Thug and Got Away With It!" murder-fantasy, you'll be hailed as a Hero Patriot  and a Genuine Lover of Liberty in no time! 




 How about some life-altering YouTube videos, also? Those always work out great for you guys. 




 And "libertarian 'social' ideals" get thrown right out the fucking window whenever even a dollar is at stake. *Every. Single. Time.*

American libertarianism is a cult of greed. It's the Scientology of politics. 




 Shitebart! 




 No, it's not libertarian. American Libertarians are even further to the right than the Republicans. 




 I relish the idea of watching them all turn blue.
 




 The *extremely* anti-American nature of those who most loudly proclaim themselves to be "***Real*** Americans" is hard to miss. 




 Why doesn't Ted just get an cash advance on the funds he'll acquire in the the "Transfer of Wealth" during the End Times?

 




 It'll just trickle-down . 




 All their beef jerky just got rehydrated.

 Those poor sister-victims were forced to pray Josh's play away. 




 Women are not brood-mares for the state. I'm sorry this disappoints you. 




 Even they know it's a losing issue now.

Which wedge issue will the American Right lose next? 




 If men could get pregnant, abortion would be declared a sacrament.  




 Something is wrong with society when forced breeding is a desirable outcome.
 




 Clearly his hatred of "the damn meddlin' Fed'rul Gubmint" is conditional. 




 Elm-tree killing motherfuckers 




  23 hours a day in an 8x8 box with either no window or a slit only a couple inches wide. That's torture.

Do they get the Internet?

 




 But the death penalty isn't as much of a populist rage issue today as it was back in the 1970s-80s.

Much of the success of American Right over the last 50-60 years has been built on exploitation of rage/fear based wedge issues.

They've all but lost on gay marriage now. What will be the next wedge issue they lose? 




 *Tales from Walkerstan* (a Koch Brothers Production) 




 Nice try, Josh Duggar 









 Alinsky's writings proposing the construction of the interstate Wal-Mart tunneling system are well known in leftist circles. 




 I really don't know how any Texas woman (or conscientious Texas man) can vote along with the GOP. 




 That's terrifying. It's a right-wing cult.  




 Hey, another Shitebart story!

Why are they allowed in this subreddit, when Salon, Media Matters, and other genuine, legitimate sources are banned? 




 Only right-wing sycophants will be stupid enough to believe Jeb's lies.

Unfortunately, there are a lot of stupid right-wing sycophants haunting American society today. 




 More from the Duggar Diddler Files.

No one seems to mention the actual victims of this: the sisters that Josh molested. Maybe they were just told to shut up and endure it because "God has a plan"? 




 If anyone is going to be tried as domestic terrorists, it should be the Cliven Bundy Militia.

Also to be charged: the head of the "Oath Keepers," who threatened Sen. John McCain's life recently (though the story was banned both in news and politics.) 




 This would allow Snowden to turn off the lights. 




 I'm sure Texas will refuse it. They don't need any help from that damn meddlin' Fed'rul Gubmint! 




 It's because he's so pro-life. 




 Can greatness be far from his grasp? 









 West Virginia ... Mountain Momma 




 He should really do a IAMA. 




 Well, if the shoe fits... 




 And in every case of this defense I've heard used by its proponents, the "socially liberal" goes to the chopping block over "fiscally conservative," *every single time.*

Libertarian economics is nothing more that Reaganomics on steroids. Recent decades have proven that these models should be moved ever further away from, not toward. 




 Many White Nationalists, Neo-Confederates, and conspiracy theorists/militia preppers have come to self-identify as Libertarians now.

Ron Paul, Lew Rockwell, and Murray Rothbard began deliberately cultivating an audience of paranoids and bigots in the mid-1980s. Rothbard even named this strategy "Outreach to the Rednecks." 

One product of this strategy was the infamous *Ron Paul Newsletters,* which have continued to haunt Paul and the Libertarian Party. [Ron Paul was the Libertarians' presidential candidate in 1988.]
 




 Clearin' brush down on the ranch. 




 Great comedic potential? 




 I'm not surprised. Something scummy just oozes through all their advertising/PR. 




 He might be resurrected as a VP candidate, however. 




 You wanted "States' Rights", Red States? You got 'em.

Can you feel the LIBERTY!^TM yet?

*Brought to you by ALEC, funded generous grants from the Kochs and their ilk* 




 If you have a job, hen you can be assured that your employer is only paying you about one-third of your worth to him at best. *You* are his profit center.

Here in our America, workers need to get over the idea that has been implanted in their brains: that somehow the noble Job Creators^TM and their financial backers are to be worshipped and trusted and placated at all costs. 

It's disgusting that for mere survival, so many Americans must live in permanent servitude to feed the hunger of the rent-seekers, profit-harvesting financiers, and the permanent leisure class of multigenerational wealth in their united, undying quest to extract and acquire ***MORE*** from us for themselves.

That is neither "Freedom," nor "Liberty." 




 Or in Cliven Bundy's case, to take it outright.

 




  I don't understand the love about raising the minimum wage. I get that it is very low, but I believe the minimum wage should be a starting salary, not something you strive to sit at.

What I don't understand is the opposite: why does the Capital Class feel that they are entitled to next-to-free labor force to exploit? 

*Real* Americans pay their employees a living wage.

 




  Rural people tend to be independent. As such, they don't trust the government... they would rather scrape by than to be dependent on the government.

They sure trust the government when it comes to farm subsidies.
 




 Because Grover Norquist. 




 I hope Ohio's Republicans have budgeted for the results of their new "forced birth" policy. 




 Last time it became a bribes-for-votes scam between Michele Bachmann and Ron Paul.

Will anyone really miss the phony Iowa straw poll, except for the state GOP fundraisers who fill their coffers from it?

 Maybe it's God punishing them for being such regressive right-wingers.

Is this statement really any different that Falwell and Robertson blaming 9/11 on gays and abortion?

Yes, it is. Because millions of people *actually believe* the second statement, and their bizarre doctrines are poisoning America. 




 [crickets] 




 Let's not forget that Reaganomics tripled the national debt in only 8 years.

That was a massive amount of stimulus spending, but Republicans will never acknowledge it, as it detracts from their masturbation fantasies : "all gub'mint spendin' is evil!" and "Saint Reagan unleashed the economy by cutting taxes!!1!"

They'll never mention that the Reaganites exploded spending.

Also, before some mouth-breathing right winger says, "but ... but ... Congress spends all the money! It warn't Saint Reagan's fault!!1!," here's a fun fact you'll never hear in the right wing media: in *every* budget the Reagan Administration ever submitted to Congress, more spending was requested than Congress ultimately approved.

Maybe it's time for "the Party of Personal Responsibility" to accept some. 




 I'm sure his fellow inmates will make an exception for good ol' Sheriff Joe. 




 The "murder fantasy" lies at the heart of American gun culture.

Forced birth is fucking evil.

Are you serious? They fell hard for neo-Conferderate goldbug Ron Paul.

 




 the "ex post fuckto" clause 




 They're the real victims here. All this time they've been instructed to "pray Josh's play away."

Given their indoctrination into the family's radical right-wing perversion of Christianity, they may even have been made to feel that they deserved or invited the abuse, because "God always has a plan." 




 Another point: the Duggars and their apologists can't blame public schools, the mass media, porn, or video games, because they kept their kids strictly sheltered from such corrupting influences. 




 *Can You Feel the Froth Tonight* 




 Also, Josh Duggar destroyed Josh Duggar's record.

I wonder how Josh's sisters are dealing with the legacy of their sexual abuse at the hands of their brother?

Did the Duggar sisters get the help they needed, or did they they just get "pray away Josh's play" counseling? 









 Josh Duggar. And her, and her, and her, and her, and her, too!

I wonder how his sister-victims are coping? No one seems to give them a second thought in this.

 Libertarians don't like anyone, and least of all themselves. 




 "And also my MONEYBOMB! Please give generously, or you hate Liberty." 




 They meet to further divide up the world amongst themselves, yet still lament the stray crumbs from their tables that others must survive upon.

 




 Of course not.  They're 100% American Fundamentalist Evangelical Protestant "Quiverfull" Kool-Aid drinkers.

Fundamentalists like the Duggars are the reason so many roll their eyes today whenever people boast about being "Christian."

The point is that the Catholic Church did itself a great disservice when they allied with the American Religious Right (who view Catholics as heretics who will be cast into the Lake of Fire when the Christian Right's little "End-of-Days" revenge fantasy takes place.) 




  There aren't really many gaps.

Josh begs to differ. 




 Probably more in a Trent Reznor/Nine Inch Nails sense.

 We all know this has nothing to do with "safety."

Oral surgery has a greater complication rate than surgical abortion. Yet somehow these restrictions weren't placed on oral surgeons (or ANY other outpatient facilities that perform such minor surgeries.) Only women's health clinics were targeted. There's no requirement for double-wide swinging doors to accommodate hospital gurneys in oral surgery facilities, for example, nor will there ever be.

This is direct, blatant, selective, and persecutive legislation by the Texas government against women's medical facilities and obstetricians performing federally legal procedures.

How many cases of cervical/uterine/breast cancer will now go undetected because of these regressive laws? How many women will die from ectopic pregnancies because they didn't have access to basic women's health care? How quickly will cases of sexually transmitted diseases expand and multiply because no testing or treatment was available? How many women will lose their only access to affordable birth control?

This entire "But... but... *it's for the womens' safety!*" charade has never been anything but a damnable lie. But you already knew that.
 




 May Texas go Blue sooner rather than later. 




  Personally.... I would want the chance to live.

You'd never have known the difference.

Call me crazy for being pro life.

And you'd probably think crazy those who view "life" as more of a non-commutable sentence of unceasing suffering ending in inevitable death than as a "gift" or a "blessing."
 




 In other news, Ben Carson won a straw poll. 




 We all know this has nothing to do with "safety."

 And then a state-forced three-day waiting period. 




 Still, there are many like him who actually believe such tripe. 




 Is there no end to the Duggary? 




 And we're going in first unless they are halted. 




 "LIBERTY!"^TM strikes again. 




 Ralph Nader was a multiple stroke victim who wasn't even on the ballot in all states, thus making a win *mathematically impossible.*

Nader's vanity campaign didn't draw even 4% in *ANY* state, but still he insisted on campaigning ***almost exclusively*** in swing states where polling was within the margin of error.

Are those facts relevant enough for you? 




 TIL tadpoles are frogs. 




 Multiple stroke victim Nader's hopeless, useless, self-aggrandizing "BOTH SIDES ARE TEH SAME!!1!" vanity/fantasy campaign sentenced America and the world to the hell of Bush/Cheney.

Denying the reality of it doesn't make it go away. 




 Tell that to the hundreds of thousands of Iraqi citizens who were Naderized.

 Well, if it's a *legitimate* rape... 




 I guess the woman's body just has a way of shutting that whole thing down. 




 It's simple: the forced-birthers clearly don't give a damn about either mother or child after launch. Can anyone realistically argue otherwise, given their constant, consistent contempt for any/all programs to assist these post-fetal Americans?

Nope. Almost instantaneously, the women and their newborns become "welfare queens" and "welfare brats" (who don't even deserve enough in SNAP assistance to keep them alive.)

The fetus fetishists certainly don't give a shit about "honoring a Culture of Life" after launch, do they? Hiding hatred of women behind a cloak of "morality" is the exquisitely cruel SOP of the American Right.

 A warning to all Republicans on the clown car: if Josh Duggar asks you to sit on his lap so he can tell you a story, ***don't do it.*** 




 The information needs to be out there showing that the family cared more about the image of the family than the actual family members.

Even more basic: they cared about preserving their revenue stream. 




 Again, this perpetuates the American Right's oft-spread *"Social Security is going bankrupt!1!11!one!!1!"* lie.

Let's be clear: the Right's goal is to undo the 20th century and return us to the late 19th century, the age of the Robber Barons. That's not a future to which any nation should aspire.

I don't think I've ever heard this particular allegation leveled. It sounds like a sticky situation. Any details?

 




 Do they really have a choice? Are they willing to risk exile from the family, having had no real education, out into a world from which they've been deliberately sheltered for their entire lives? How would they support themselves? Where would they go?

(Blanket not optional.) 




  who later claimed homosexuality leads to pedophilia.

Since by that time he certainly knew he was engaging in pedophilia with his sisters, I wonder if this "homosexuality leads to pedophilia" belief is an implied confession to Duggaring his brothers, too?

This case gets stranger each day.


 




 Multigenerational Duggary? 




  And they did talk to a cop about it.

Yeeaaaah, about that cop... he was a family friend who is now serving a 50+ year sentence for collecting/distributing child porn.

It really astounds me the lengths to which people will go to continue defending the Duggary...



 




 #***SOCIALISTS!!!1!11!*** 




 Ask the Duggars what's wrong with *them.* 




 The Duggary apologists sicken me. 




 Josh's sisters sure didn't.

 




 Ugh, quite the contrary. 




 Yet more Duggary unveiled. 




 or excitement 




 The report details that Josh went from sister to sister, stating, Apparently all of the girls were sleeping in a common room at this time.

Imagine those poor Duggar girls lying there awake while they pretended to be asleep, waiting their "turn," powerless to stop their brother Josh from molesting their sisters right in front of the others, wondering what age he'd start on the next one, knowing that they were going to be the next one forced to lift their wrinkled nightshirt so Josh could poke and probe and prod and squeeze wherever he pleased with his sweaty, trembling fingers  

 and all the time knowing that ***it must all be hidden***, first, to protect the family, second because they were allowed no contact with those outside the sect, and third because no one would ever believe them anyway, instead calling them temptresses and liars and sluts and whores who had brought utter disgrace to the family and destroyed the family's means of support with their foul lies . . .  




 The "stern lecture" family friend-cop Jim Bob and Josh talked to years after the Duggary occurred is now in prison himself, serving 50+ years for possession/distribution of child porn.

Model citizens. 




 I thought JimBob said God's law was greater than the law of man.

Well, it's different if you really, really, *really* want to bone your sisters. 




 Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar just told their daughters to pray Josh's play away.

 What is, as you call it, the "transgender agenda"?

The sister-victims Josh diddled? Not so much. 




  The European states are also much smaller geographically, much smaller in population, and much more homogenous ethnically and linguistically.

This is one of the most trusty dog-whistles of the American Right. Translated, it means "what works quite well over there won't work at all over here, because minorities."

At least be honest about the use of the statement.

 There really is no "left" in America.

The US political spectrum runs from right-wing through extremely right-wing to *insanely* right-wing.

 No. That's why we all know Rand's stunts are nothing but prelude to setting up a string of MONEYBOMBS! over the next 1.5 years.

 Nope. The Kermit Gosnell case is a perfect example of Libertarian ethics at work.

He's not a folk hero, and this isn't some "principled stand."

 How else can they keep the abortion issue alive?

Republicans fear nothing more than losing their #1 wedge issue.

They know they can't run on their 30+ years of failed "trickle-down economics." They need a rage issue to continue to divide people, and abortion is their huckleberry. 




 They just wanted to talk to her about Liberty. 




 But why? Why must we kiss the corporations' asses day in and day out to hold the country together, or so we've been taught?

Isn't the burden of proof on them to show it *isn't* a dangerous practice?

I think the Founding Fathers would puke themselves inside out if they could see how Americans cringe and grovel on their knees before the throne of today's new Monarchy of Profiteers.  




 Shouldn't We the People know what is being injected into our land? Don't we have a right to know? Are we scared of hurting the poor -widdle-petroleum-cortorations-fee-fees?

Or do private profiteers "trade secrets" take precedence over our safety? "What they don't know won't hurt 'em!," right?

Red, white and blue

People shufflin' their feet

People sleepin' in their shoes

But there's a warnin' sign

on the road ahead

There's a lot of people sayin'

we'd be better off dead

Don't feel like Satan,

but I am to them

So I try to forget it,

any way I can.

I see a woman in the night

With a baby in her hand

Under an old street light

Near a garbage can

Now she puts the kid away,

and she's gone to get a hit

She hates her life,

and what she's done to it

There's one more kid
that will never go to school

Never get to fall in love,

never get to be cool.


Keep on rockin' in the free world,

Keep on rockin' in the free world

Keep on rockin' in the free world,

Keep on rockin' in the free world.



We got a thousand points of light

For the homeless man

We got a kinder, gentler,

Machine gun hand

We got department stores

and toilet paper

Got styrofoam boxes

for the ozone layer

Got a man of the people,

says keep hope alive

Got fuel to burn,

got roads to drive.


Keep on rockin' in the free world,

Keep on rockin' in the free world

Keep on rockin' in the free world,

Keep on rockin' in the free world.

 I've been continually amazed how many American Catholics worshipped Benedict and despise Pope Francis.

American Catholicism needs to free itself from its poisonous alliance with American Evangelical Fundamentalism. 




 Christian Nationalism been the unidentified elephant in the room of American Politics for nearly four decades now.



 




 The American Right doesn't give a damn about children, especially once they arrive.

But relentless exploitation of the ***"ZOMG ABORTION!!1!"*** issue sure is a useful tool to manipulate the votes of Christian Nationalists. Anti-abortion hysteria gets many Americans to vote in complete opposition to both their own interests and the best interests of the country.

Does anyone actually believe the Republicans want to lose their favorite wedge issue?

That's why today's Republicans will ***never*** allow abortion to be banned in America. The abortion "debate" brings the American Right Wing too many votes.


 




 If there's one thing that defines Christian Nationalists like Santorum, it's pride in their own ignorance. 




 Sounds like another act of Duggary. 




 But... but... he heard it on AM radio! 




 Oh, Cliven. 









 When has consistency or reason ever been applicable to the politics of Christian Nationalist Republicans? 




 True. It runs about 17%-20% and is already calculated into the purchase price of goods.

 Why do people still fall for it?

Sometimes, I almost believe there's a subset of poor Republican voters that just flat-out enjoy the continued degradation and the humiliation.

Even today, the sharecropper still forced to lick the boot of Master still fancies himself higher than a slave. For some people and some voters, maybe that's enough in life.

Nonetheless it seems clear that this pathogenic belief is some foolishly clung-to remnant from the psychology of the European peasantry of centuries ago along with their love/worship of the very hereditary Monarchs that oppressed them so relentlessly. That attitude was transferred to America in the form of the class and caste structure of Antebellum South, and we fought a war that killed 740,000 of us to free ourselves of that remaining horcrux of the Monarchy, the landed gentry of the Plantation Class of the Old South. America all but destroyed itself to liberate itself from that deep-rooted poison.

150 years later, I see little difference in how so many still vote in complete opposition to their interests and that of the nation. It's not "the Gub'mint" that's the threat to our Nation; in fact, "the damn Gub'mint" is the only thing standing between the relentless privateers of capital and commerce who seek to own all for themselves and their families at the expense of all others living in unending servitude to our new Monarchs, the Monarchs of Capital.

So those who who join militias with the intent of "restorin' the Constitution" and "fightin' for our Liberty" should not be at all surprised when they wake one day to find they fought in "the Great Struggle" just to make a Koch their King.*

American stubbornness is not a virtue when it is so relentlessly self-destructive.

*See Libertarian Adam Kokesh's call for "the Final American Revolution" on July 4 a couple years back, or the continued self-delusions of the Sovereign Citizen/Bundy Ranch Milita zealots who fantasize themselves "Patriots." 




 "Why did non-wealthy American voters keep falling for it?" This is the question political historians of the future will ask.

How did the United States  a nation that survived the Age of the Robber Barons, the Great Wall Street Crash of 1929 with its ensuing Great Depression, and the Financial Meltdown of 2008 and its ensuing Great Recession  not learn the lessons repeated again and again within each circumstance?

Hell, let's pre-empt the political historians of the future. I'll ask the question now: "Why do non-wealthy Americans (and in many cases, dirt-poor Americans) keep falling for it?" 




 Republicans have been playing the "the liberal media are persecuting us!!1!" myth-lie ever since Nixon introduced it in his "Checkers" speech.

[Here's the "Checkers" speech on YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqjwBDH-vhY) Give it a listen and hear how Nixon whines and whines and whines about persecution just like the Republicans, Libertarians, and Republitarians today.

Highlights: when Nixon complains that (unlike liberals' wives) his wife Pat Nixon doesn't wear a fur coat, but a "respectable, *Republican* cloth coat" and also invokes the namesake cocker spaniel "Checkers" and how "we're never going to give her back, no matter what *they* say.

It's a masterpiece of self-pitying whining that the Republicans have looked to for inspiration for over 60 years now. Watch it -- it's really worth your time.

 That's been a struggle in society since there has been society: mutual suspicion and resentment between urbanites and rural residents.

This has to end. Our lives are all intertwined and interdependent. We must acknowledge this if we are to have a chance at taming those who profit from the exploitation of each of us against the other.

 




  Hahaha, this guy doesn't know Republicans. They will just double-down on the stupid, blame Obama or the nearest Democrat, and profit.

I still can't understand why  is it simply spite on the part of these lock-step voters? If they can't have control, they'd prefer to run the ship aground for all of us?

Why is it that these self-declared "Patriots" and flag-worshippers, America's *de facto* Nationalist party, seem so hellbent on burning our nation to the ground?

Republicans, Libertarians, Republitarians of Reddit: what's the motivation here? What's your endgame? 




 Stopping Reconstruction (at the demand of the South) was even worse.

The War to Preserve Slavery that the poor white sharecroppers were sent to fight killed 750,000 Americans, all for a cause that was already doomed years before the Confederates fired the first shot.

The descendants of these same poor white sharecroppers have misdirected their contempt at Washington DC ever since. It's probably just too painful for many of them to look in their own backyard and realize that they destroyed themselves to keep the Plantation Owner class in power (even a century-and-a-half later after it spat out their dead and broken bodies on that Fool's Errand.)

As always, war is a rich man's quarrels via the suffering and death of the poor, who are sent to fight the battles.

That's information that you and I aren't allowed to see, thanks to the intervention of self-appointed Censorship Mods who act in complete opposition to the Reddit creed of "user-driven, user-curated content." 




 Yeah, the whole Lawrence crowd has been starstruck since *The Day After.* 




 So you'll vote out of spiteful opposition at a random anonymous person "smug"?

That's sure giving a lot of power to the "smug" person over your life.

Why cut off your own nose to spite someone who you don't know and will never meet? Seems pretty self-destructive. 




 The GOP is utterly and evilly brilliant at exploiting wedge issues to get Americans to vote against themselves. 




 He's speaking of restaurant chain/fast food chain workers. 




 Hey, those "Small Business Owners"^TM and "Job Creators"^TM will spare no expense to serve their customers! 




 And then the very same scamsters rushed back in and bought those same properties for pennies on the dollar.

Uncontrolled capitalism is far more dangerous than any monarchy. That's the great irony of the United States: having been founded as an independent nation in opposition to the very concept of Monarchy, we now live on our knees before our new Monarchs: the Titans of Capital.

 




  As someone who grew up in one of those "Christian" churches, I can attest that they hate democrats as much as they hate black people, women, and homosexuals.

But why? I'm continually baffled by this.

From whence does that virulent hatred come, and when did it start? Are they still sore over the Civil Rights movement? The New Deal? Richard Nixon's cocker spaniel?

Is their compulsion to inflict their destructive spite against their fellow Americans so great that they are oblivious to the grievous damage they inflict upon themselves? And if so, how can they *possibly* claim to be "followers of Christ?"

Maybe the Evangelical Protestants simply *believe* they're following Christ when they've fallen prey to a scam by "the Great Deceiver." Given the aura of hate, fear, divisiveness and greed that right wing politics has promulgated in America in the last hundred years under the cloak of "morality," it's an idea that merits consideration. 




  The people doing the tax cuts, aren't the people feeling their ramifications.

The ultimate question: why do so many of the people who suffer the worst under the Republican's trickle-down economics so readily and zealously lick the boots of those forcing the suffering upon them?

Yet more confusing: how/why do the poor boot-lickers getting stomped the worst insist that they are "the freest people on Earth"? 




  The working class became the working poor and we are all in debt the ultra rich. That doesn't spell prosperity to me.

It does to the Kochs and their ilk, who bestow names such as "Americans For Prosperity"^TM on their Astroturf front groups.
 




 *tap tap tap* 




 I wonder how Bob Dole feels about what Brownback is doing to his home state. 




   How to destroy a country, one State at a time.

Koch-onomics!

 




 Explanation: "It allows us to scam votes." 




 Sorry, Bernie would never never have anything to do with right-wing extremist charlatans like the Pauls.

Conversely, the kind of people who worship the Pauls (White Supremacists, Neo-Confederates, Militia wannabes, and conspiracy theorists) would never have anything to do with Bernie. 




 But... but... what about the JOB CREATORS!^TM ??? 




 There isn't any such thing as a "moderate Republican" anymore. 




 How has the American economic abortion known as "trickle-down Reaganomics" continued to hold sway with so many for so long? 




 ZOMG teh TYRANNI!!1!! WE needz teh "LIBERTEH!!1!"^TM

[Send me your worthless fiat currency and I'll send you a newsletter 'splainin' it all!] 




 "Social Justice Warrior" is the new "statist;" everyone that uses the thinks they're brilliant, insightful, and "in the know," but everyone who hears it is laughing their asses off whilst rolling their eyes.

Yes, Libertarians and Republitarians, this means you. 




 Rasmussen, haha!

might as well go back to citing "unskewedpolls.com" as proof that Romney was going to sweep in 2012 




 Who should we call if the government is infested with Southern Avengers? 




 Well, it's not a *completely* lost cause.

After all, Rand can keep fleecing the rubes that fell for his dad Ron Paul's "LIBERTY!!1!"^TM schtick in 2008 and 2012! 




 Well, after Rand's dad Ron Paul quit his 2008 campaign, he threw his support for president to Dominionist preacher Chuck Baldwin of the Constitution Party.

Maybe Chuck will return the favor by nominating Rand for his VP this time around? 




 He's going to fleece paranoid right-wing rubes, just like Dear Old Dad trained him. 




 He's yet worse  a Republitarian. 




 The mouldering corpse of Murray Rothbard. 




 I nominate Rand Paul's son William Paul as his chauffeur.

William Paul is also well-versed in how to handle flight attendants should they get a little mouthy and/or cut off his drink service.
 




 What's controversial about Lew Rockwell? 




 Sy Sperling! 




 Adam Kokesh. 




 Lew Rockwell. 




 Also, while we're at it, get rid of the bogus "Not US Politics" and fabricated "Rehosted Content" lies that have been used to censor our community for the past two years.

Reddit is meant to be ***USER***-driven and ***USER***-curated; *NOT* ***MOD-DICTATED*** or ***MOD-CENSORED.*** 




 How about you guys stop censoring us with the bogus "Off-Topic" and "Rehosted Content" lies? 

You guys don't have to answer to the Gunbertarian-Authoritarian censors anymore. Why mimic their old patterns of systematic censorship?  




 It's one of the favorite tools of the Censorship Mods, though they don't pull it nearly as frequently now that the Gunbertarian Mods who seized power a couple of years back have been forced into exile.

It's generally used to kill content they deem "liberal." The "Rehosted Content" lie is another favorite excuse to censor our community. 




 Oh look! The Censorship Mods have hit us with the "Off-Topic" lie again.

I guess that leaves little hope they'll do away with the "Rehosted Content" lie they invented to auto-censor submissions from Salon, MediaMatters, and Talking Points Memo, is there?  




 And I *did* realize I was dealing with a Tea-Gargler. Bye! 




 HARHARHAR DAE SOROS FOX NEWS RULZZ!!1! 




 "Screwing the poor harder shall surely make us all rich!"

  your average RWNJ nose-cutting face-spiter. 




 Or maybe it's because his Dad Ron Paul and Michele Bachmann were both involved in cutting Iowa straw poll payola checks to create a false illusion of support outside their circle of RWNJ loonies. 




 He knows how hard it is to put food on your family. 




 Scott Walker is in Wisconsin, not Michigan. Nice RWNJ dodge, though. 




 The battle Scott Walker *should* be fighting: getting the Kochs' balls out of his mouth. 




 Why do so many of the Tea-Gargling Militia "Patriots" seem to head to Wal-Marts when it's time for their "Last Stand"?

Another fine example here:

[The Chilling Anti-Government, Cliven Bundy-Loving Facebook Posts of the Alleged Las Vegas Shooters: Jerad and Amanda Miller's Facebook and YouTube likes included the NRA, Rand Paul, FreedomWorks, and other right-wing championsand videos justifying the killing of police officers.](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/06/jerad-amanda-miller-las-vegas-shooting-cliven-bundy-anti-government)
 




 "Sovereign Citizens" are nothing less than domestic terrorists.

See Oklahoma City and the Cliven Bundy "Patriots." 




 This is what happens when you drink the Tea.

Don't Drink the Tea. 




 "...if you're looking to rile up a crowd of angry, ignorant Tea-Garglers." 




  From the ancient Greeks we know that you can't step into the same stream twice

Try explaining that to the poor fools who still fall for "trickle-down" Reaganomics.

 




 Something in the way she moves 




 North Korean hotel fire is Best Korean hotel fire! 




  I fail to see how the closer you get to libertarian types you get more lemmings.

This is what's known as "tragic irony." 
 




 Why are they called Teabaggers?

 More accurately:  they believe whatever the Kochs (who founded and funded this phony Astroturf "movement") tell them to think. 




 Or elected Governor. 




 No doubt this character will start a "GoFundMe" to score some Wingnut Welfare.

"I'm a good, God-fearing American persecuted by the damn liberals fixin' to ruin what's left of this country. Send me money!" 




 -- Spock 




 Just wait until the Koch moola starts to hit. 




 And the Ron Paul campaign's Kent Sorenson payola scandal. 




 And somehow (I *promise* you) it will all be explained away with some derivative of the eternal "it's those damn liberals trying to tear a good man down" meme. 




 try /r/MRApersecutionfantasies 




 "Domestic disturbances" are the type of call where responding policemen are most likely to be shot dead. 




  What if people named "Jim" violate my religious beliefs?

Then you would not be a fan of St. James.

 




 Does this mean that we won't let fundamentalist snake-handlers dictate public policy anymore? 




 She isn't always right.

She'll be right exponentially more often than any remaining Reagan/Bush/Cheney "Supply-Side" cultists out there.  




 "Look, sir  droids!" 




 So they can spot each other easily while hunting womp rats. 




 The Empire's been cutting costs. No more reimbursements for dry cleaning. 




 Or maybe they just overstressed the binary load lifters 




 She really pissed them off when (as an act of self-defense) she threw her Tattooine VitaMix Boiler at them. 




  So it's illegal to be a meteorologist in Wyoming?

There's really no point anymore because HAARP.

 




 America's been taken hostage by right-wing extremists, and many voters suffer from Stockholm Syndrome. 




 Science is just for Damn Commies anyhow. 




 Most Americans have little vacation, and what little we do doesn't afford most Americans the ability to ever travel overseas (to say nothing of the expense of international travel.)

We're a perfect little prison colony of compliant slaves, if only because we've never known anything else. America's permanent leisure class intends to keep it that way. 




 I've never understood why Americans scream so much about how the US is the only place on Earth that has "FREEDOM!"^TM even as we let the permanent leisure class rape any remaining human will out of us. 




 Also, does anyone else remember when California bars and restaurants argued "ZOMG teh bans on teh indoor smoking will utterly destroy us and kill ***ALL*** teh buzinezzez!!1!"

That was over two decades ago. Shockingly, California still has bars and restaurants. 




  we would most likely see a hefty dip in the stock market.

ZOMG we couldn't *possibly* dare to trouble the passive, profit-harvesting investor class, could we? We must work and work and work for them until all those who seek their profits from the exploitation of the labor of others feel that they *finally* have enough to achieve personal satisfaction.
 




  The fact that I KNOW the GOP will be against this makes me feel like I live in bizarro world. You'd think everyone would be okay with this.

It's truly startling how many Americans vote in complete opposition to their own interests.

The Kochs and their leisure-class cronies make no such foolish mistakes. In fact, they fund disinformation campaigns specifically designed to keep Americans from voting in their own interests.
 




 This is why it's so important for the many negative-knowledge voters who currently vote Republican/Republitarian to begin voting in the interests of themselves, their families, and the nation instead of for the sole benefit of their leisure-class Masters.

America's extremist, regressive right-wing must be brought to heel lest America return to the horrors of Victorian-Era economics. 




 Much of the South (and Americans in general) just can't seem to escape their "there are Lords (us), and there are Peasants (everyone else) who just won't learn their proper place" economic worldview.

Such belligerence, arrogance, and greed caused the Plantation Lords of the Old South to launch what remains the bloodiest war in American history, in which over 700,000 Americans were killed.

The sad thing is that so many of the poor, undereducated sharecroppers who are inevitably sent to fight and die for the Master Class will *still* defend those Masters to the death and call their devotion "Patriotism." It's almost as if they have been conditioned to expect and enjoy their own exploitation.

*Maybe* someday they'll snap out of it and actually begin to vote and work in the best interests of themselves and our nation, rather then spending their lives on their knees cringing before the Bossman  but American history teaches us to temper any such expectations.
 



 




  According to one survey

CATO or Heritage Foundation?
 




 And just look at the fight we had to put up against the Republicans for even that simple accommodation way back in the Clinton Era.

"Pro-Family/Party of Family Values" my ass. 




 Please go into as much detail as possible. What would you see as the positives of such an abortion ban? Would there be any negatives? 




 Yes, that's what's makes it all the more frightening.

Nationalistic fringes bent on moral crusades will self-justify any behavior to reach their goal.

An excellent novel that addresses similar issues is Margaret Atwood's *The Handmaid's Tale.* 

 




 More Republican pandering to their right-wing fringe.

Kowtowing to such extremists rarely ends well. 




 With nasty, big, pointy teeth! 




 There's a lot of rumbling, grumbling, and chest-puffing coming from the White Nationalist/Neo-Confederate/Gun-bertarian Militias in recent times.

I wouldn't be surprised at all if these groups have seen an uptick in recruitment due to the "ZOMG JADE HELM 15!!!1!" paranoia they've managed to promulgate on the Internet. 




 Agreed, but Rand would never chance his toupe flying off on camera.   




 Is mocking Rand's drunken, car-crashing, flight attendant-assaulting son William Paul OK? 




  What happened at Digg that was so awful?

[The Digg Patriots.](http://pubrecord.org/special-to-the-public-record/8121/rigging-of-digg-covert-mob-conservatives/)
 




 ***STATES' RIGHTS!!1!*** (to polio) 




 **"I have heard of many tragic cases of walking, talking normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines"**

***Rand Paul***

Also, "Universal health care is slavery!" and co-authoring Tea Party screeds with the "Southern Avenger." 




 This is hardly a new observation.

Why does Rand deserve any credit for that most other sentient political observers have noted for years?
