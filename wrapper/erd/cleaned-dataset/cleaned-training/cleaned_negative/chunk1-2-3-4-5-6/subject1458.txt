 With a scant six months left until the next Dragon*Con, I have begun working on my costume for this year. My question is this: who else will be cosplaying and what will you be going as? I'm working on a rather convincing Battlestar Galactica uniform, myself. Yes, of course I mean the reimagined series. 












































 I have no idea about this one, guys. I built a playlist on a USB drive (all files are MP3s and have worked on my 360 before) and when I plugged it in today to play New Vegas without having to deal with Johnny Guitar, the music player refused to recognize any of my music files, giving me this error code. I've tried everything the prompt suggests and I've got nothing. Any advice? 



















 I need to know the best Android phone on AT T in a relatively short amount of time, as I just found out I'm getting a new phone and time is of the essence. Help! 


































 Just an idea. It seems that all the colleges in Hall County are closed for the snowpocalypse in Hothlanta, and the highways are likely to be too icy for rural /r/Atlanta subscribers to make it to anything that would go on down there. Are there any Gainesville, Oakwood, or Flowery Branch redditors who would like to have a meetup?

Yes, I am aware that I like fedoras. Remember, pull no punches. What do I need to fix? 




 Well, rally it's just one problem. My giftee has confirmed receipt of their gift, and I've confirmed receipt of mine. I still haven't gotten my award, though. Is there a date at which they're sent out or something?

Sorry if this is a noobish question. 




 Dear Reddit,

This was a difficult year for me. I had a surgery and spent months in recovery. However, through it all I had Reddit - a fun site suggested to be by one of my best friends a few months prior. This year would have been a nightmare without the fantastic community and amusing links that this site has to offer. 

As we head into 2011, I can only hope that every Redditor has a wonderful year and the best of fortune and health. So thanks again, Reddit. You're the top!

 There was a video submitted here not too long ago and I seem to have lost it, g-ents. It involved an old man - referred to henceforth as Weed Veteran - informing the public about the joys of cannabis. Now the time has come to share Weed Veteran with my friends but, as mentioned earlier, I can't find it! Can anybody help me? 














 There is more awesome in a box than I've ever received in my life. Gifts include...

 I think it would be great to have a meetup of Redditors in Georgia, especially given that we're such a red state that it can sometimes be difficult to find like-minded people.  


































 That's the question folks. If, per chance, you believe homeopathy DOES work, I'd love to hear how.

For disclosure's sake, I do not believe in it. 




 It was yet another great con, huh? I do hope more redditors find this subreddit and next year we can plan something awesome. 









 Greetings Reddit. It's story time. 

A few months ago, I had a fairly complicated surgery that required an extensive recovery. I persevered, however; by maintaining that I would be able to go to Dragoncon, my absolute most favourite convention ever, and room with a woman whom I absolutely adore and hang out with some great friends. I pinned all of my hopes during recovery on enjoying four days in the heart of Atlanta in a state of constant nerdgasm. This was not to be.

Tonight, at the close of the first day of the convention, I have gotten ill and must return home. I feel absolutely horrible and I needed to vent. Thanks for reading, Reddit. I don't give a shit how you vote, I just want to know if anyone else has dealt with shit like this lately. I know it isn't the biggest thing in the world to lose sleep over, but this is literally the sole thing that kept me even mildy sane over the past few months. 



















 Who's going, what are you going as, and where should the redditors meet? For what it's worth, I'll be the Soviet amputee roaming around the con. Shouldn't be too common a costume. I don't think.

EDIT: Since no one has proposed a Reddit meeting place, may I propose the lobby of the Hyatt Regency on Saturday at some point to be agreed upon?

EDIT 2: As Ketchupgoddess pointed out, "There is already a Reddit/Fark meetup scheduled for the main lobby of the Hilton on Saturday at 1 pm." Be there or else! 









 As the title says, I enjoy Russian music of the Soviet period. While I do not identify as a Communist, I think their aesthetics and music were impressive and, while shallow and transparent; are certainly more pleasing than the rubbish on the radio these days. Ask me anything! 





























 I've been having an issue with my WASR 10. I got it yesterday as a get well present from my father, and I have yet to shoot it. It's brand new, sealed in box. My problem is that the military issue double stack magazine it comes with is a tight fit into the receiver. 

If it helps, this is a GP, no ban WASR-10, so it's not like I have to use single stack mags or anything. I can tell, based on the 'arrow in triangle' stamp on the receiver, that this rifle is made from former military parts. It also came with the Tapco G2 trigger group installed.

Other than this mag problem (which doesn't completely prevent me from inserting the mag, it just makes it an annoyance) I love the thing and can't wait to get well enough to shoot it. 



























































 So, I decided to be the pro-gun guy in a thread in the general reddit. This is, of course, a terrible idea, but I felt it was warranted. Now, people are downvoting me without even bothering to engage me in a serious debate about firearms. Could someone comment and at least make it appear as if I'm not some lone gun freak?

[Here is the comment.](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/caste/shooting_spree_in_uk_leaves_12_dead/c0ra6vr)

EDIT: Thanks to everyone who has upvoted, but a serious debate on the effectiveness of British gun laws has yet to arise. The karma was not my issue. My problem with the post lay in the lack of discussion.  














 Does anyone here know the lyrics to Adrian Rollini's song "Sweet Madness?" It was recorded, I think, some time in the 1920's-1930's and the song is firmly stuck in my head. I know it to be completely distinct from the Ari Koivunen and Joyce Collins songs, if that helps at all. 



















 Age: 20

Sex: Male

Location : Due to ongoing arguments with the alleged "Church" of Scientology, I will go no further than stating Georgia.

Occupation : Student

Hobbies/Interests : Science, science fiction, the Internet, old jazz, literature, anime, firearms, and gaming.

What websites do you find most useful : Well, Reddit of course. I also frequent wikipedia and (until my friends leave it) Facebook.

Favourite music/movies: I'm really into the Ink Spots right now, and my favourite film of all time might be Hitchcock's Notorious. I also enjoy early George Lucas and, more modern, I liked The Invention of Lying.

Nature of your disability: Spina Bifida of the L2 vertibrae. Right leg amputation. Solitary kidney. Fortuitously, I lived far in excess of the doctors' original estimations and didn't have to have any form of potentially brain damaging fluid shunts which are so common with my condition.

Were you born disabled: Yes.

Has disability had an impact on your spiritual life, if you have one: I am an atheist. I don't think it has anything to do with my disability, I just don't find the Judeo-Christian concept of an omnipotent, omniscient *AND* loving god to be at all logical.

Are you easily offended by disability jokes : Offended? Ha! I make them all the time!

How active are you in the disabled community: This is my first real activity in the community.

How do you deal with getting more attention than the rest of your family: I just do. I mean, no one is bothered about it, even when I ask. Either they're great liars or they don't care. If they don't care, why should I?

Do you ever have dreams where you aren't disabled at all: Not really. I think it's because I've always been disabled.

Have you ever damaged someone who was trying to help you: Yes, but I'd rather remain private on that one if suits everyone just fine.

Tell us about the time you most shameless exploited your disability to get something: Every year, I go to dragoncon - a regional sci-fi convention. Now, the able bodied amongst us have to wait for hours on line to get their tickets. Me? I take my friends straight through admissions with my mighty feeb powers!

How do you cope with well-meaning idiots: Grin and bare it. After all, they're trying, aren't they? That's better than apathy or outright hatred.

What is your most-developed talent: My writing. I used to play trumpet, but I've fallen out of practice.

What would you like the people around you to do differently: Nothing, really. I mean, nobody really treats me like I'm disabled, so I don't care. Sure, strangers try to be polite and hold doors for me, but I think it could be much worse.

Best piece of advice you can pass on: Don't sweat the petty things and don't pet the sweaty things.

I hope that my filling this out will encourage any lurkers to tell their stories. We, the mods, have set up this questionnaire for the benefit of this subreddit and its users, and we hope that you all enjoy it. 




 I was born with Spina-Bifida, fairly minor, though I am confined to a chair. I also have severe scoliosis which resulted in one of my kidneys failing to form. Further complications meant that I later lost my leg (not that it was really an issue, as the leg refused to respond to any nerve stimuli) when I was 5.

Anyway, I was quite fortunate in that I didn't have to have a shunt performed and I never required too much care or assistance. I am also fortunate in that I am self sufficient and that having no use in my legs has given me pretty good upper body strength. Anyway, that's the extent of my disability - for all of its pros and cons. Has anyone got anything similar? 




 Based on an idea in an AMA, I've created a subreddit for disabled redditors to talk about themselves. I call it Oddly Normal, and I hope it serves the community well.

 Is anyone here good with graphic design? I've got photoshop, but I'm not too good with it. 




 I need some more things to do in the greatest game ever made. I am also looking for exceptionally high quality addons. 












































 So, I have the McAfee virus package and I think that it's responsible for my browsers not working. Steam and Skype seem to work just fine, but Chrome and Firefox will only function intermittently. What do I do about this? 



















 Go ahead, ask away! 










































































 I, for one, would love this feature. A redditor could block users who spam post a lot and could also do away with users whose posts they find bland and uninteresting.  




 I am 19, live in the Deep South, am a sworn enemy of Scientology and have only one leg... and it doesn't work! I'm generally pretty upbeat about life, am getting my degree and am now here to answer the insatiable curiosity of Reddit.

EDIT: Thanks for all of the questions! I'm really glad I did this. 







































 I'm at wit's end, reddit. I really like her, I'm not sure, as I've never cared for anyone so deeply, but I think I even love her. She said she wanted someone more serious, willing for marriage and to have a child. I would have done this for her, but alas, I could not keep the relationship. Is there any way to fix this? Or have I lost this forever? I need help, here. 




 I think a little bit of background may be necessary. In fact, I know it is necessary, as only like one guy on here knows me IRL. 

So, I am 19 and due to the positively shite economy, I live with my parents. My parents always get to the mail due to the fact that I am in a wheelchair. Normally, a harmless (if suffocating) arrangement. 
Now, the last time my parents found out I had a girlfriend, they were extraordinarily happy. Not the sort of happy that's fun, either. The sort where they throw fits and constantly interrogate you as to the location of the apple of your eye, the object of your desires, she who hung the moon for you. To go through this again, dear Reddit, is an unacceptable proposition.

I had gone to dragoncon with the last girl I dated, and we both decided to keep it professional. We're friends, we decided, nothing more. Soon after, a good friend from high school decided to ask me out. She is extremely pretty and has always been extremely kind to me. I would be most foolish to decline. The issue is, however, her mother is the extremely controlling sort who speaks little English and insists that her daughter not date, so I rarely get to see her. 

NOW, the point. For Christmas, she decided to mail me my present. For all I know, it could be something extraordinarily embarrassing that could only be from a girlfriend. If my parents discover this, I would have to have yet another relationship out in the open. It's not like I'm ashamed or anything, all my friends know. 

Anyway, I beseech thee, Reddit. What should I do!?

EDIT: I am abundantly aware of my affinity for the comma and my propensity towards run-on sentences. I also have pictures of both of us, should you need them.

ANOTHER EDIT: Wow, you guys are great. I was expecting this to languish for days without any reply. Imagine my surprise to find so much advice so quickly!

STILL ANOTHER EDIT: Pics were requested.

ME: http://imgur.com/gDhBX Sorry, but it's a couple of months old and my most recent. My camera's been a bit shit lately. I'm the one in the pic who isn't Malcolm McDowell.


RESULT: Due to the wise council of my fellow redditors, I have decided to man up and just put it on the table. I shall tell them and get it over with whilst informing them that they have a tendency to be rather annoying in their querying. I thank you all very much for your input.
 



















 I mean, really. This is ridiculous. I come to reddit to read about things that matter. Tangible, real things. Not some rich athlete smashing his expensive SUV. That doesn't affect me or the real world. It is not legitimate news. It is a product of our celebrity obsessed culture and a symptom of society's degradation. I expect this to get downvoted. Let it come.

EDIT: Obvious exception to this post. Although, ideally I'd like to not even have to make it. 




 Can we just cringe at the fact that it was made into a movie, shut up about it, and move on with our lives? Bram Stoker's rolling in his grave as it is, guys. This is simply ludicrous. That is all. 




 Original post: http://www.reddit.com/r/scientology/comments/9p8eo/scientology_may_be_opening_in_my_county_how_can_i/

The happy news is that the building permit was denied. Fliers were handed out in my community detailing the crimes of the cult, letters were written to the county council members, and members of the appropriate city councils. I had other (legal) tactics for each step of the construction should it have come to that, but thankfully they were stopped. I and my friends in the area remain vigilant, but for now my county is free of the cult's taint and we can all breathe a little easier around here. 

I would like to thank my fellow redditors as well as the whyweprotest and Chanology forums for all of their help. We have won this battle, and the war shall be ours! 




 This is just a poll I made, nothing more, nothing less. I'm trying to solve the ages old debate... 




 I just don't get it. Our government has been running out of control for years, regardless of who's in charge. Congress is beholden to the issues of companies, not the needs of the citizenry. No matter which party we have, it gets worse each year. 

Meanwhile, our culture is degrading at an alarming rate. Music is nowhere near as classy as it once was, movies are becoming unwatchable by and large, and modern literature is often better used as firewood. No longer are virtues such as loyalty and love extolled by the media, no no. Now It's all about who can fuck more or make more money, and having an intellect makes you almost a target for ridicule. Furthermore, the gullibility of society is increasing, fundamental religions are gaining headway, even cults such as scientology are reporting increased membership.

Tell me, what hope is there for the species? Would I feel so depressed about this if I lived in Europe or something? Help!

Sorry if I rambled, I just wanted to get this off my chest. Thanks for your patience, if you made it through this. 




 The Cult, I have heard, is considering opening a branch near where I live. (I cannot say exactly where, I want to avoid Fair Game after all.) I want a legal way to oppose them. I've considered writing members of the local government and detailing Fair Game, Snow White, Freakout, et al. and this seems to be my only real option.

 I've also heard that Scilons shut down personality tests if you flash a Guy Fawkes Mask (USEFUL!) and thankfully, masked protest is legal here. I feel as if I'm up against a corner here. I love my hometown, I don't want it to suffer under Scientology. I need all the help I can get in this matter. I don't care what people believe, but Scientology is, as an organisation, pure unadulterated evil. HELP, REDDIT!


EDIT: Thank you, everyone, for your advice. This is all very helpful. Keep it coming, friends! If I am successful in this, I hope to organise. Perhaps I can make a page, telling people how to keep the cult from integrating into their hometowns. It is my hope that eventually, through efforts similar to mine, we can stop the spread of this cult. It's a lofty goal, but hey, it can't hurt to try right? Unless I get SP'd.

EDIT: Co$ was denied a building permit. This is a joyous time! 




 It's just... the whole site seems to have a rather anti-US military stance. Has anyone ever considered what would happen if we hadn't bailed out the world in WWII? Or if we hadn't collapsed the Soviets? Or if we weren't cleaning up the terrorist filth? It's ugly work, and the methods are somewhat cruel, but the ends justify the means. Always.

As I await the inevitable shitstorm that is to follow my comparatively radical world view, I ask you to consider a world where the Nazis won WWII, where the Soviet Union never collapsed or perhaps a world where Islamic Fascism reigns supreme and everyone is subject to Shari'a law. Imagine a world without the US military and it's means and methods... It's not pleasant. You need us, world. More than you could possibly know.

Thank you for your time.  
























 I'm not sure if this is the place for this, but about a month or so ago, my brother's girlfriend broke up with him. Ever since, he's taken it incredibly hard. He's utterly inconsolable and it seems no one can really get through to him. 

I've tried chatting with him about it, having had my share of lady troubles in the past, but it's no good. He had once confided in me while they were still together that he saw them as being quite serious. I played it off as him being a high-schooler and thus given to such fancies, but it's obvious that he cared deeply for her. 

I don't want him to continue being so depressed, Reddit, as he's exceptionally bright, his terrific grades have begun to falter somewhat, and he's got a full ride scholarship that I fear he may be jeopardizing. 

Help me get my brother through this, guys. 




 A few months ago, it was not uncommon to be able to find Makarovs at J G, Cheaper Than Dirt and others for sale at a fair price but now I can't seem to find them. What happened, gunnit? 












































 For me, it has to be 922r. What practical purpose could it serve to limit the amount of foreign parts you have on an arbitrarily defined "assault weapon?" I think the rationale is to prevent the importation of military style weapons, but there are a plethora of US made parts that render this purpose moot. It's absolutely retarded. 

Does anyone else agree or can you come up with a worse law? 





























 I don't even have much idea as to where to start with this, but I suppose I can just ask my questions here and hope for answers.

1. Are there any other Communists in this general region?

     a. Are there any Communist organizations in Georgia?
   
     b. Are there any [/r/Communism](/r/Communism) readers in the state? 


2. What is the best way to spread Communist ideas in such a traditionally anti-Communist region?

3. What is the best way for one in such a politically isolated area to contribute to the cause of the Proletariat? 

4. Finally, is there any suggested reading for someone in this dicey political climate? 

Thank you for your time and consideration, comrades. 
























 An e-gift card to Papa Johns can go a long way and I now have food for the rest of the month thanks to my generous benefactor. 

Thanks to a current deal, [I got three medium pizzas and a 2-liter of Dr Pepper.](http://i.imgur.com/UyoVO.jpg) I fully intend to pay this forward once I get my pay on the 1st of next month. So from the bottom of my heart, thanks Fapocalypse_Now.


Doo doo butter. 



































































































 I consider myself a liberal and I have for quite some time. The Left's advocacy for egalitarian treatment for all, social services and better living conditions while advancing human rights is just common sense, to me, and the Left seems to be the only end of the spectrum concerning itself with these noble goals.

However, I have noticed that the one right that progressives by and large tend to ignore is firearm rights. So, my question, being a left winger who is also a firearms enthusiast, is this: why are so many progressives anti-gun? Aren't firearms the last line of defense people have against their government? 







































 I'm looking for a job for my fiancee. We're willing to move absolutely anywhere and could really use the job. She has a four year degree from UC Berkeley in Molecular and Cellular Biology and can happily furnish details on demand.  



















 Hi, /r/Atlantans! I'm engaged but in a long distance relationship and next month, my lovely fiancee is coming to Atlanta. I myself try to get to Atlanta every chance I get, but I am not in town often enough to know any of the good restaurants to which I could treat her and I don't know which ones would be accessible for my wheelchair. Further, we are somewhat strapped for cash as college is very expensive and most of our spare funds are spent on airfare whenever we can get it.

Therefore, I would like /r/Atlanta's advice. What would be an accessible and reasonably priced, yet delicious and memorable dining experience to which I could treat my beloved? 

BONUS: You might remember us if you went to the Dragoncon meetup. We were [these](http://i.imgur.com/YynFY.jpg) people. 









 I'm in a wheelchair and there don't appear to be many couples' cosplays involving wheelchairs. Does anyone have any suggestions?  
































































 Basically, I'm asking for volunteers. I have successfully mapped from the end of the blue line to my village Leningrad and would like volunteers to help me make it a bona-fide road. Any takers? 




 In the process of ghetto rigging it, I totally felt like the Doctor; especially once it pinged back on. I think I may be watching too much. 









 With the recent transgressions against the peaceful protests, the brutality of the corporate police and the unwillingness of OWS moderators to allow discussion of anything but the most bleeding hearted pacifism, I think a new platform is needed to discuss - purely hypothetically and without any limitation - how we should proceed if the peaceful protesters continue to be ground into the dirt by police. 

Sure, it's just Atlanta and Oakland now, but what next? Do you really think Bloomberg will let the protesters stay on Wall Street for long? I do not advocate violence, but surely we've enough freedom left in this country to spread the word that we don't have to be docile little bitches for our corporate lords, right? 



















 My fiancee and I just watched [The Fantastic Four](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omKd_bUQlXo) - the 1994 unreleased film - and it was the most hilarious thing we've seen in quite some time. Do you guys have any truly awful films, and does anyone else like to do this? 

















































 I don't even know if this is the right place to ask this, but I was wondering if anybody in the area would like to buy my old Soviet Army uniform. 

It's in perfectly good shape, but I've got bills to pay and I bought it at a point where, well... I didn't have bills to pay. It's of 1980s vintage and hasn't been worn since the Communications Bureau in Ukraine divested itself of it.

It includes the jacket and pants. The jacket is sized 51 centimeters at the chest and the pants have no sizing information, but should fit anyone who can fit into the jacket. I am selling it for $125, but the price is negotiable. Let me know if you're interested!
 












































 So, I'm disabled: a through the knee amputation that requires me to use a wheelchair. Here's the kicker, though: I love urban exploration and have always wanted to give it a try. However, abandoned buildings tend not to have working elevators and since they're generally very old, they almost always lack ramps where they're needed. So my question is this: can anyone think of a way to go urban exploring while in a wheelchair? 

Miscellaneous, helpful information: I am fairly mobile outside of my chair, though it's restricted to crawling and that's not wise in crumbling ruins, and my chair is manual so I don't have to charge it or anything. 

I know this is an unusual question and I'm honestly not expecting a miracle here, but if anyone has any information at all, I'd consider it a boon. Thanks for reading! 









 I've not really posted here much, but my fiance has; so bear with me if you don't mind. 

As you are all, I'm sure, acutely aware; the night is the absolute worst time of day to be missing your lover. It isn't so bad during the day, because I can text or call her and she texts and calls me. At night, though, as I try to sleep, I feel her absence very keenly - as though a part of me were missing. After noticing we were both on Google+, I texted her and we chatted for a while on Skype and she missed me as horribly as I missed her. This is a common course of events.

I want to know, /r/LongDistance, if you have any tips to alleviate our longing for each other. Is there anything we can do or - perhaps - send each other to make our beds feel less empty at night?  









 I don't know if this is related to Minecraft.net or a problem on my machine, but this morning, the launcher wouldn't let me login. I shrugged it off and waited a few hours until noon. I tried again and the same thing happened. It is now 18:29 and I have tried for a third time, to no avail. I've already updated Java so I don't see what else the issue could be. Any tips?

**EDIT: PROBLEM RESOLVED** Downloading the new launcher has fixed everything.  





























 We were the obnoxious making out couple at the meetup. I was dressed as Adama and in a wheelchair while she was the sexy lady in my lap. 

Our camera was awful and we only got a few pictures, but I kinda wish we had more pics of the convention, so if anyone wants to help me find pictures of ourselves, I would appreciate it. She didn't cosplay, but I did on Friday and Saturday as an East German soldier and Commander Adama respectively. If you can help, I'll thank you forever! 




 Just an idea I had thought of for this subreddit. Feel free to shoot it down, but I'm in Con Drop mode so hear me out. 

What if we had flair for this subreddit and it was what we want to cosplay next year? Reactions: go!  









 Anyone want another meetup tomorrow? My fiance and I had fun.

EDIT: FUCK IT, I MADE ONE.

6PM SUNDAY
Marriott, 10th floor lounge. Be there or you hate reddit and might end up getting robbed by Andy Warhol's ghost.

Trufax. 














 Now I can't get back to sleep. :( 



















 I'm getting into town on Thursday and I was wondering if anyone else had anything planned for Thursday evening. A lot of my friends won't get in til Friday, so I was thinking it might be a good idea to see what my fellow Reddit congoers are doing. 




 I have noticed, when looking at pictures of countries outside of North America and Western Europe that there seems to be no care given to public access for disabled people. I am very curious as to why this is the case, as at some point in the future I would love to travel. 

I know this is a very broad and general question, but it seems like if the United States - as backwards as we are in accommodating those outside the mainstream - can make laws mandating access for handicapped persons, other countries might do the same. I would love to hear what anyone might have to say on the matter. 
























 There was a picture that was presented twice, the first time being pirates storming a ship with something to the effect of "We're here for yer booty." And the words: How most people view piracy.

The image was again repeated, the second time saying something like "How it really is" with the pirate captain stating "We be here to make copies of all yer cargo." Of note was a toothless pirate scab saying something to the effect of "Where be the amputee porn?" Or something. Anyone got this?

 I was there last Friday celebrating my birthday and I have got to know... How on Earth did it take me this long to go there? That was so awesome. Are there any other Lips fans on /r/reddit? 

















































 The wildlife can be imported directly from Australia. 














 The survivors can design the memorial. 




 We all know the cinematic tropes in cinema for the various accents of the world as expressed by Hollywood films. However, as somebody who hasn't experienced as much foreign cinema as he'd like, I'd love to pose a question to you, non-Americans of Reddit. How are the various accents of the United States (Southeastern, Boston, Californian, et al) portrayed in the culture of your country?  









 Also, ants can carry them off in the night. 





























 I've long been of the belief that cat declawing is an awful thing to do to the animals. The bulk of evidence I've seen seems to agree with this point of view, and it's been gaining a lot of supporters as of late.

HOWEVER: it would seem as though the American Veterinary Medical Association and several other reputable veterinary groups disagree with this assertion. While I tend to agree with scientific and medical establishments, there's no doubt that there's money to be made on declawing, so it seems as though they've got something at stake here. Add to that that the American anti-declawing movement originated in hippy-esque circles which aren't really known for their adherence to science, and I have doubts. 

I was wondering where the skeptic community falls on this issue and if there were any resources out there that might make a case for declawing not being harmful.

 Okay, so this is a long shot, but there was an incredibly catchy music video played at the beginning of the Dub Your Own Hentai track with surprisingly high production values and showing surprisingly little in the way of nudity. Does anyone happen to have it? 




 So they've been handing out those buttons for free Momocon passes if you should happen to find your match. Why not have a Reddit thread to try to find our opposites?

I'll start. Mine is 624 
























 As a disabled man, getting around the con is somewhat difficult. I feel that having a room in a host hotel would alleviate this to a degree, but no matter how early I check, they seem to be booked up. What's the most reliable way of getting a room at one of the big five? 









 This is going to be big, people. 







































 Until the 80s, the US had been a leading participant in the World's Fairs, and many of those held on US soil have become regional and national cultural touchstones. Why has the US seemingly dropped all involvement in World's Fairs? 




 They're both about evil shadowy groups of supernatural baddies conspiring to take over humanity and they both have persistent screen captions as an integral, tangible part of the universe. Fringe is simply Kill la Kill's Boston.

Karma, plz. 














 It doesn't make sense to me. The best I can figure is that COMPNOR needed an enemy for the widespread human majority to hate and aliens were a convenient target.  









 It may be due to the rose colored fog of nostalgia pervading the game, but for me, Metal Gear Solid's music just felt so much more atmospheric and evocative than the music in Metal Gear Solid 2 and its' successors. It could just be due to how much I fell in love with the game, but MGS1's duel music and cutscene music just stuck with me so much more. Am I alone in this assessment? I get that it's all completely down to taste and there are no wrong answers, but I'm dying to know how everyone else feels about this. 









 In the BioShock series, the city of Rapture is shown to be an astounding testament to mankind's technical expertise and the tenacity of the "utopian" vision of Andrew Ryan.

In the viral game Something in the Sea, we are shown that the initial construction of Rapture (with stage I being completed in late 1946) is financed by shell companies such as Warden Yarn who buy large quantities of materiel from Scarlet Sovereign with these contracts then being reneged upon receipt of the raw materials. 

This presents a problem, however. With Ryan disappeared to Rapture and his shell companies on the surface surely made pariahs by his lack of payment on large contracts, he was surely cut off from receiving raw materials from sources on the surface. However, we're told that Rapture continued to expand until 1951. This surely would have required a vast amount of material well in excess of the sums we're shown in the Scarlet Sovereign receipts. Further, any civic planner worth a damn would have a setup for procuring additional materials for repairs and expansion to keep pace with population growth.

Now, as we're not shown any sort of method by which Rapture can quarry stone or mine ores and the trees in Arcadia are surely insufficient for providing lumber in addition to oxygenating the city, I've got to wonder: where did the additional raw materials for Raptures maintenance and expansion come from?  




 Everyone stopped moving and it's just really annoying and inconvenient.  









 I know that Cerberus owns many front organizations and cover businesses and was originally a branch of Alliance intelligence, but how do they possibly have the dosh to acquire and cultivate all of their scientific and military talent? How do they finance their fleets of warships and dropships and improbable androids with complex smart AI? 

Inquiring minds demand answers! 









 I'm going to momocon for the first time on Saturday, and I'm curious as to whether or not they have a disability services booth or something similar as Dragoncon has. As a guy in a wheelchair, the disability services badges have always been a huge help in letting me enjoy panels, and I'm hoping momocon has something similar. However, I couldn't find it on their website. 




 Additionally, how is Lenin viewed in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Ukraine, the Baltic states and other former Soviet republics?

 Wat do? 




 My girlfriend and I are looking for rooms as we were bumped from our previously arranged accommodations. We'd prefer something close and for some privacy, both because I'm in a wheelchair. What are our chances of finding something this late? 




 I have a tremendous fondness for 9x18mm and the general idea of compact-ish combloc pistols really holds a dear place in my heart and in my hands. However, no gun store or pawn shop seems to have them and I prefer to avoid dealing with online purchases - even though they seem to lack these pistols as well. 

And so, I turn to /r/gunsforsale. I would like to offer some delicious leafy green cashy money to anybody in the Gainesville, GA area who might be willing to sell me one of these weapons. I am highly negotiable on prices, and I can start at $120 for a PA-63. More for a Makarov PM or CZ-82. I also have a genuine Soviet Tokarev without importer stamps that I could be persuaded to trade, if you prefer. 

Shoot me a reply if you're interested! 









 I am currently unemployed and in the Atlanta area - just north of the city, OTP, and I'm looking for work. On the writing front, I've written gaming reviews and articles for massvio.com and gamegeex.com, as well as reams of unpublished poetry and short form fiction. I'll write just about anything, really, though articles are my forte.

As for voice acting, I'm just breaking into it though I have - as a matter of curiosity - received some informal coaching and advice on the matter from Mike Dowling, audio lead at Obsidian Entertainment. 

Really, I'm willing to do anything else that pays as long as it isn't too physical, as I'm a paraplegic amputee. However I am much more capable than most people would think. Don't be shy, drop me a PM!

I'd put my resume here, but I haven't got any prior work history beyond my writing and I tend to keep my portfolio closed to all but serious enquirers. I assure you, however, that I am highly qualified for a wide variety of tasks. Should you chose to grant me some form of interview, I promise you'll come away from the experience quite impressed. Of this, you can rest assured.

 Do we do trading in this subreddit? I have a ton of Soviet Cold War militaria in storage (that I intend to get pictures of as soon as I can get to it) that I'd love to let circulate. I've held on to them for quite some time and I have quite a few duplicates.

Two sets of Soviet uniform pants and jacket - one enlisted, one officer's.

A Soviet pilotka cap.

A Soviet militsiya visor cap.

Several medals and miscellaneous objects that I need to inventory.

An East German helmet, field jacket, and AK magazine pouch.

And more! If you're curious, ask me as to what all I have and what I'm willing to trade. 














 I like to take a light touch with management in regards to this place, but people have been complaining about the "childhood fears" trend ruining the overall quality of the place.

 December 26 and we can put the LD out of our R! She won't be here in time for Christmas, but I really don't care in the slightest. After a year and a half of being at opposite ends of the United States, she's finally moving here. I just wanted to share my elation with you all.

EDIT: A big thanks to everyone congratulating us. I hope our success can inspire you all to stick in there for as long as it takes. I know we weren't as far apart or as long separated as many of you, but it's still a relief that she'll be coming home at last.

EDIT 2: It got bumped up a day. I just ordered tickets... AND SHE'LL BE HERE FOR CHRISTMAS! SO MUCH HAPPY. 









 In 1863, the Union Army of the Potomac under Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker and Maj. Gen. George G. Meade is routed at Gettysburg, dissolving in a disorganized retreat from Confederate military forces under General Robert E. Lee after a decisive Confederate cavalry raid by General JEB Stuart breaks the Union forces in the area. 

With the road to Washington wide open, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States of America, signs the Confederate drafted Instrument of Surrender which recognizes the right of the Confederate States of America to exist and protects the legal right of states to leave the Union as they so choose. Over night, Confederate governments spring up in the border states and the economic and military power of the United States slides slowly into irrelevance. After several decades of Union losses and Confederate gains in the West and in the Caribbean and Mexico, the Confederacy enters the 20th century as the dominant power in North America.

In the 1930s, the South falls on hard economic times as the world plunges into the Great Depression. The South's former slaves, freed by act of President Gustave Tutant Beauregard in 1917 in reaction to fears of reaction by anarchist radicals, are still horribly oppressed and are now denied even the meager wages of the sharecropping farms that have gone under in reaction to decreased demand from factories in Europe and the border states of the Confederacy. Uniting with prominent Southern Communists and dissatisfied veterans of the Confederate actions against Mexico in World War I, they march on Richmond and seize the capitol, executing President Thomas Hardwick and installing a vanguard party, headed by a Stalinst strongman to oversee the Confederacy. 

On 5, May 1932, The Confederate States are reorganized into The Soviet Confederacy of America; a Workers' state in direct alliance with the Soviet Union. All they need now... is a flag.

tl;dr - supposing in an alternate history, the Confederacy stuck around long enough to be overthrown by commies. What would their flag look like?


I've always loved the symbolism of Communist countries and the Confederate States of America. Had I an eye for design and a better computer, I'd puzzle out what this flag might look like myself. I don't. What I do have, though, is imagination. With this short, plothole riddled alternate history yarn, I hope that /r/vexillology can whip up a flag that would bring this improbable nation more vividly into the imagination. Thanks! 





























 In the 2005 film adaptation, I believe the original intent of the book has been altered somewhat. When we first see a tripod, a tremendous noise is heard emanating from its carapace. I believe this to be the flatulence of the alien pilots, who have left their homeworld to pass wind in order to be polite. I have evidence to back up my theory.

1. The plants: these aren't for terraforming, as one might think. The aliens just have bad hygeine and the mushrooms that grow in their bathrooms left spores that follow them to Earth.

2. The fact that everyone is screaming and running away. I don't know about you, but I'd love to hang out with a giant alien robot... unless it was farting.

My final evidence is the most important fact on which this theory hinges. At the end, all the tripods collapse and the aliens within fall out and die. To me, this clearly shows that their own fumes were so noxious that it killed them.

I'll take my internet points, now. 









 With this new subreddit, I must personally confess that I don't know as much about Leninist theory as I'd like to. While I'm researching, the fact is that in the meantime I will need dedicated mods who are well versed in the writings of Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, and V. I. Lenin to help me in running this subreddit. 

If this describes you, or if you have CSS experience and can help us design a decent page, I'd greatly appreciate your input. Apply below for modhood, comrades, and help us move the discussion forward. 




 New subscriber here, come from a fit of nostalgia that got me back into the franchise as of late. One thing I've always found appealing about the series was the soundtrack, especially in the original Metal Gear Solid.

My question here is this, though. Why did TAPPY stop handling the soundtracks? To me, the music contributed to a sense of atmosphere that none of the subsequent games could ever recapture, even when MGS4 [revisited Shadow Moses Island](/spoiler). Was a reason ever given for this or is it left as mysterious as the exclusion of the FAMAS from subsequent games? 

Again, Harry Gregson-Williams was just fine but his music made the latter games feel somewhat disconnected from the first Metal Gear Solid. It's nothing against him, he's just not TAPPY. 
























 I'm typing this on my phone, so please bare with me.

Recently, my laptop died. It had been the only way my fiance and I had of seeing each other and now that she's gone back to college, We now have no way of going to sleep together and it's really wearing on us. 

My question to you, /r/longdistance, is what you would regard as the least expensive device that can run Skype from a bed. Tablets and netbooks are in play, but not smartphones as my contract isn't up for some time. Advice? 




 In ten short - yet oh so long - hours my SO will be here in Atlanta from Berkeley. All the excite, my fellow LDR-ers. ALL THE EXCITE. 



















 Seriously. I haven't been smoking for long. I only discovered it at 21 and it's a year later but you guys have made it the best thing I've ever gotten into. So here's a self telling you guys you rock and spreading the good cheer. Peace, ents. [4] 









 It is as it is. I can't have any nut products and most of the AVB products I've seen that don't require cooking are peanut butter sandwiches and nutella and the like. I can't have any nut products whatsoever, so I have to ask: what can I put my AVB in and enjoy it with that won't send me to the ER? 




 Hello, Reddit. I am train_subject1458. I decided to do an AMA as I am getting into voice acting and I'd love very much to have a decent demo tape to use. However, I'm not necessarily the most creative sort so I thought I'd ask my favorite internet community to help me out a bit. 

So here's how we play this game. You leave me a quote - anything within reasonable length - and I'll render it for you in my glorious voice or else in my best approximation of a voice of your choosing. 

Some details, first, though. 
I am a 22 year old man from Georgia, in the United States. I can do passable high status British, genteel Southern, modern redneck, Morgan Freeman, and so many, many other voices. If you can name it, I'll give it the old college try. 

Ready? Alright, then. Let us begin.
(http://vocaroo.com/i/s0pjgF14Zuaj) 




 I am dreadfully curious about this. Apparently, my vocal skills are - according to people I know - quite good and I have a natural knack for speaking. Further, my SO frequently tells me that I should look for work in voice acting. As a fan of video games and animation, I would be delighted to do something along these lines, but I have no idea where to start. Any advice?

EDIT: [HAVE A LINK!](http://vocaroo.com/i/s09VAwAMENWP)
It's a vocaroo demo of my voice clocking it at around eight minutes as I read the Raven by Edgar Allan Poe. I have a much greater range than this, I think, but for the time being this is the sort of character that I think I'm best at portraying. 




 wut do? 


































 For me, it's Morrowind. I can't even begin to count all the times I've reinstalled that game. I love it so very dearly.

Honorable mention: Jedi Outcast. 




 I recently acquired an RAI 1911 tactical and, while I couldn't be happier with it, the slide is not to my liking. I'd always admired the look of GI-style 1911 slides and even though the sight picture is inferior, I think I'd like to trade if anyone is willing. 

My slide has some light finish wear, so I'm willing to accept less than pristine slides. If anyone is interested, please let me know!

 I'm 22 and I'm in a wheelchair. This Saturday, I'm flying across the country to see my fiancee who I've not seen in months. Now, I should be elated, but instead I can't help but be incredibly fucking nervous. Why?

The Transportation Security Administration, the people we Americans tolerate so willingly for the illusion of feeling safe are going to absolutely violate me. I am certain of this. Why? Well, they haven't got the best track record with people in general, but add to it that they [have](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zFi18ioqYk) [a](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2116881/TSA-subject-child-wheelchair-invasive-airport-security-tests-Chicago.html) [shitty history](https://gripevine.com/gripe/20731929/tsa-agents-abuse-disabled-travelers-pbi-west-palm-beach-airport) in dealing with disabled persons, I can't help but feel intimidated. I look at how we're willing to just accept this from my government as our economy continues to implode and I can't help but weep. I can't fight, but I can't help but feel I'd sympathize with and possibly even join up with a populist uprising if ever we had one. 

So my question to you is this. What would the government have to take from *you* to make you tell them that enough is enough?

 The gun show is on Saturday and I've got $250 to get a new handgun and I want your opinions. Here are my criteria:

* Steel frame
* Semi auto
* External hammer
* Manual safety
* Compact
* Affordable ammunition
* Rugged

Caliber and recoil are secondary concerns as I've got some pretty good arms on me and my shot placement is decent enough at self defense ranges so I don't need excessive stopping power. 

I should also say that I'd like something that would hide on a wheelchair fairly well. Paraplegic here, so wheelchair carry demands compactness and reliability. 

My frontrunner so far is a milsurp CZ82, but I'm open to suggestions. 









 After six months; a bad incident that cancelled one of her plane tickets and countless exams, a fuckton of heartache and thousands of hours on Skype, my fiancee has gotten her plane ticket and will be here in JUST OVER A WEEK!

 So I'm genuinely curious. What's the general consensus on these import bans? I'm not seeing anything wrong with the Crimea situation, so I've been against them from the start, but I'd love to get others' opinions. 




 Sure, I knew that, but I don't imagine they're doing any dirty work until they're 18 or so.  




 Well, looks like I've got some reading to do. I agree with you in the functioning of militaries in the modern world, as well. Sadly, armed forces are more often sink pits for surplus population and wealth that could be much better used in much better pursuits. This is not unique to the DPRK. The US does it, most European nations do it. Sure, there's military actions in these states, but it's often to the ends of amoral puppet masters and not to the ends of the national interest. Rather like the DPRK, though in a grander scale and different guise. 




 Absolutely. For example, I'm sure that whoever founded Nestle had no idea they'd become the amoral bastards they are today. I'm sure that the founders of the Republican and Democratic parties had no idea they'd allow America to become what it is today. And I am abundantly certain that the old Bolsheviks came to rue what became of their revolution. Movements can certainly lead quite far from where they're intended to go. 




 I can understand the moral side to this, but from a practical perspective, the North Korean military isn't a fighting force. It's a social institution which rarely wields martial power as it knows that any sort of war they fight is a losing proposition. Instead, it's an internal control mechanism which exists to scare people into line and run camps. I highly doubt that 16 year olds are given rifles and told to shoot people. More likely, they're learning to shoot and parade around and basically nothing more.

Further, the military is likely the best route most North Koreans have for getting regular meals. To say nothing of medical care and possible opportunities for education and social advancement within the wretched *Songbun* system that military service affords. 

So, while I abhor the DPRK regime, letting 16 year olds into the North Korean military is acceptable.  




 Movements have a way of getting away from their founders. 




 Ah, well. Have some upvote. 




 That's the joke. I worried I was too subtle. Such jokes are better said than written, I guess. 




 No, but I'm working on it. (Sfine) 




 I guess there ain't any lips touching theirs then, huh? 




 Kotaku is garbage. Please avoid giving them traffic in the future. 




 I want one... 




 MADD are fucking puritan fascists. 




 Do you smear cream cheese on simians? 




 Is there any canon info on Asari gestation? 




 An emblem of lies for a land of lies. I take it back, that's horrendously offensive. 




 Offended? By Greenland? 




 Or aliens. 




 Direct to door? That sounds amazing. 




 I didn't know that was a thing and love historical cosplays. Next year... 




 Possibly, if they were spaced right. I know that cosplaying in the dead heat of the Georgian summer has made me beg for a winter convention, though. That would be nice. I'm sure I'm not the only one who would love that. But you can't just move Dragoncon to winter. It's a summer fixture. So there's at least two cons right there. Maybe devote one to fantasy and one to scifi?  




 Twenty? Maybe ten. In twenty years, without capping or expansion to mitigate crowding, Dragoncon will have to be split into two or three different cons throughout the year. 




 Hello, fellow Gainesville-ite.  




 My serious answer would be covert assassination and massive electronic assaults on their information infrastructure. 




 So Putin's kin are responsible for something done accidentally by some rebels funded and supplied by people way down the chain of Putin's command? I mean, fuck, they should have trained their AA people better, but I don't think they set out to murder civilians. They thought they shot down a transport carrying some of those guys shelling their cities and killing their people.  




 John Candy esque whining: "Why don't you care, press? Writing that book about how much I hate you men really took a lot out of me. It kiiiiilled me!" *laugh track* 




 There's a Fallout wiki called The Vault. Great for lore stuff. 




 Ah, right. Better to live on your knees than die on your feet, eh? I never bought that notion. A life lived in submission isn't truly worth living. 









 Please speak more truths, brother. Let the slaves of the false god hear your words! 




 "I tried but it just keeps doing that whole 'pile of broken bits' thing. Think I should delete System 32?" 




 This is really good propaganda: simple, direct, difficult to refute. 




 I don't seem to remember it that way. My friends and I all thought the camps were pretty well formed and battle lines drawn at that point. I could be misremembering, but I'm quite sure of it. I will admit that it hadn't become nearly as shitstormmy by then. 




 Labor Day 2014? It was slightly after. I remember wondering if the SJ people were going to flip shit about it and discussing it with friends at the time. 




 Maybe the same race that Guilty Spark encountered in the wreck on Installation 04? 




 He showed up at Dragoncon last year without issue. He was super fun, very genial. Great guy, all around. It hurts to see people dogging him so unfairly for having an opinion. 




 John Candy as Andrea Dworkin would be the greatest movie ever. 




 Utterly tactless. 




 I can't recall. It was Neelix heavy and had some guy who developed a superweapon that was used against the Talaxians. 




 Thanks, hombre. 




 Looked it up, didn't find it. 




 Soviet and Communist memorabilia. I can typically identify which era of Soviet history a specific medal or uniform was manufactured and worn in and the identity of most East German, Chinese, Vietnamese and North Korean decorations. 




 Whelp, we finished Reddit. 




 Well, eventually a conservative faction of real Mandos shows up to bust heads and set shit right, but it still seemed really forced and contrived.

Also, as mentioned, the art style of the show was really bad to me. I would have LOVED it if they had kept the Tartakovsky Clone Wars' style and knocked it out in Flash or something. I don't know why it bothered me so much. 




 Yeah. They were the ruling government on Mandalore. It was awful. 




 Voyager also wholesale ripped off "Duet," possibly my favorite DS9 episode. 




 I'd source this, but I'm on my phone. Check out IBM and Ford's prewar activities, though. They're two companies I know off the top of my head who dealt with Nazi Germany. I can't think of any US companies that were working with Imperial Japan, however. 




 Pacifist Mandalorians fucking ever

Sorry, bud. I disagree for lore breaking examples like that. I also wasn't a fan of the art style. Blech.

 I'm not talking about specific firearms models (and he features plenty of actual firearms in Metal Gear). I'm talking about things like trigger discipline and proper detailing, with adequate consideration given to things like actually fitting a mechanism in the design of a fake gun. You can draw any sort of gun you like, but drawing one with a believable location to hold the thing and put a magazine in it that will have the right amount of room to feed into the chamber and a believably placed trigger mechanism is quite another. 




 Could be bakelite? Maybe some very thick varnish? If it's in Japan, though, it's most assuredly airsoft. 




 The man seems to know guns. He gets a lot of things about them right in his games that others fuck up.  




 The Philippines has a claim on the islands there too. If it was still part of the US, that means the American Navy would be there to enforce those claims.

I agree entirely. However, we could also look for the Communist Chinese to build a much stronger navy. The [PLAN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Liberation_Army_Navy) has, until recently, been something of a red headed step child amongst the Chinese armed forces. Naturally, the Military Commission had been rather keen on the advantages of a true blue water navy for some time, but until very recently the technical expertise and vast resources necessary to create and maintain such a force had eluded them. 

However, in the past twenty years, China's economy has exploded and (coupled with the opening up of former Soviet technical expertise) the Chinese have been able to acquire the backbone of a true blue water fleet. Where once they had been able to field a token submarine force, they're now able to field carriers and light cruisers. 

Now, back to the What If. One imagines that with a US territory not too far off and their Nationalist rivals licking their wounds on Taiwan, Mao might look at a Navy as a much more vital asset. The Communists might even have looked to their friendship with the Soviets in a more careful light and worked harder to placate Khrushchev in an effort to avoid the Sino-Soviet split, thus ensuring that Soviet naval power (which was far from inconsiderable) would come into play in the West Pacific. This is all highly speculative, naturally, but the naval situation alone could pose for scores of HistoryWhatIfs. 




 Underwater, you mean? Andrew Ryan was an incredibly successful businessman topside. In a museum located at Ryan Amusements, the story of the voyage (and subsequent refitting for ocean floor construction) of Ryan's private ocean liner The Olympian is detailed, along with the hard work of Ryan's private army of laborers. These laborers were given places in Rapture for their trouble (and, one assumes, to preserve Rapture's secrecy) but were forced to settle in the maintenance tunnels beneath the Atlantic Express rail lines, now known as Pauper's Drop.

In other words, a lot of the Family Splicers that Delta murdered there are the men who built Rapture. Thanks, Delta. Jackass. 




 That poor rifle. 




 Glad you think so! Thanks! 




 Kroger unionized employee here, making $7.25/hr for 25 hours a week (if I'm lucky) and I'm responsible for a huge share of our positive feedback surveys. I look at moves like this with envy, personally. 




 Rapture employed a system of fog emitting shrouds to keep people from finding the lighthouse which served as its entrance. Of course, during the initial startup phase, there were problems: mass dieoffs of fisheries, oil slicks, and the like. However, as Rapture's defensive systems (torpedoes, mines, inferred anti-air capabilities) resulted in disappearances of shipping and aircraft that remained unexplained to the wider world - coupled with the extremely inhospitable nature of the frigid North Atlantic meant that a large swatch of sea was left quite avoided: cursed to the superstitious and commercially dead to the rational.

As it was never a particularly well travelled region of ocean in the first place, nobody really felt the loss for this and, by design, Andrew Ryan's shining utopia achieved perfect isolation from the outside world... barring the errant daredevil diver or a domestic situation that would make Jerry Springer gasp. Otherwise, Rapture marches on. 




 I imagine it would be a similar situation, but with far more pressure for either independence or statehood given the Philippines' substantially larger population. I'd really like to see how having a large US territory in that region would impact relations between the Communist and Nationalist China. I'm sure Chiang Kai Shek would have been more confident in his position with so many more US Forces swarming around in the Pacific. 









 What are you waiting for, an engraved invitation! Do it now, Samuel! 




 I agree entirely. We've let bigots ruin so many cool things. Let's reclaim them. Fuck prejudice. 




 It's okay. If she does get rid of them, they'll just come back. 




 Yep. ~~Guy~~ Gal who designed it was a Socialist, IIRC. Good on ~~him~~ her, I say. Capitalism is a rotten, rotten system and we need to dispense with it. 




 I didn't downvote you, but your tone was needlessly condescending and I thought I'd point that out. Whatever.

Allons enfants de la Patrie,	


Le jour de gloire est arriv ! 




 This idea's got Moxie, Billy. 




 More like /r/UnusualIdeasAndSubredditSuggestions, amirite? Except for Shifty. The things /u/Shifty_Drifter are doing with this subreddit are commendable and worthy of praise. 




 Do it. Now. Make it the prime time of your life. 




 They'll never ignore you again. 




 Wait, picking it up doesn't... I've been playing this game for years. How did I not know? 




 Read the Thrawn Trilogy. Do it now. Also, Darth Plagueis and the Episode III novelization. 




 Seriously. You're discussing a word, Reddit. It's 'niggers.' You look childish if you dance around it like that. 




 Fuck you. Upvotes away. 




 For real. Whatever happened to courts and pageantry and uniforms for civil officials? Casualism is so boring. 




 This just tells me that nature hates base 10. 




 I've said it before and I'll say it again: the ATF is too powerful and needs to be disestablished, its functions scattered to the winds and its personnel devoted to running a chain of one stop fun stores.  




 While it is very restrictive (not all that unusually so for nations on the Asian continent), it is distinguished by having successfully unified China (for the first time since the downfall of their last dynasty) and having done more for literacy and human development in China than anyone else. For these reasons, the Communist party is not without its supporters.

Not sure why communist is used as though it's a bad thing. Ever read Marx? Communism is, at its heart, a very good and benevolent philosophy - much moreso than capitalism.

Also, the Guomindang are the Nationalist Chinese, the ones currently in exile (for the most part, see: The Revolutionary Committee of the Guomindang) on Taiwan. 




 That's a funny way of spelling Mr Rogers in a Blood-stained Sweater. 




 I'd really like to see something set in a post Lamb Rapture. No idea what they could possibly do, and that's what makes it so exciting. 




 Misogyninjas 




 Ever read about the Guomindang? It got pretty shitty after Chiang Kai Shek took over. 




 Rent is cheap? FREE ON STEAM: CONFIRMED.

Something something metro? ENDLESS SLOGS THROUGH TRAIN TUNNELS: CONFIRMED.

OP has found a goldmine. 




 OP's title is misinformed, if nothing else. Inaccurate, in any case. 




 Except that the majority of Crimeans have no love for the Ukraine and identify as Russian. The majority of Crimeans wanted to either be independent or rejoin Russia before this whole thing happened. The status quo was not all that popular. Only small groups of people sought any sort of tight union with Kiev. 




 He ended it after it was stabbed in the back and the questionably legal [Belavezha Accords](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belavezha_Accords) made continuing the Soviet Union an impossible prospect, yes. Note that the signatories of this pact were traitors acting in their own interests. The majority of citizens in Byelorussia, the Ukraine, Russia and in many other SSRs were actually quite in favor of continuing the Soviet Union. I've no doubt the world would be better off if it were still around. It would have saved everyone a lot of suffering and bloodshed, for sure. 




 Relevance being? Most Tatars today weren't born in Crimea. Their ethnic group may have had a claim to the place at some point, but if most Tatars alive today weren't born in Crimea, it's not really a homeland, I wouldn't imagine. You're attempting to argue from emotion. That's a poor debate tactic. 




 The legality of the Soviet Union's dissolution aside, [Russia's legal continuity from the Soviet Union on the international stage is well established.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succession_of_states#Soviet_Union) 




 Those guys who lost it in a battle and mostly weren't even born there since their ethnic group only started moving back in relatively recently? Nope. It's mostly ethnic Russians that live in Crimea anyway. 




 Crimea was ceded to the Ukraine under peaceful terms when they were part of the same country. As Russia is the sole legal successor to the Soviet Union, an argument could be made that they can take it back. The Tatars are not in the same position. 




 Isn't Fallout supposed to be all about Americana, though? Seems to me like foreign countries would be great for DLC, but that's it. 




 It's not so simple as that. Crimea was Russian. The only reason it was ever ceded was due to Soviet infrastructural convenience. Crimeans never wanted to belong to the Ukraine for the most part. They intervened on behalf of their people because they didn't want the Crimea getting swept up by post Yanukovych, anti-Russia sentiments. You'd act on your people's behalf, too, if Azov Battalion was a factor. 




 Curious: what's wrong with the Crimea situation? The Ukraine was unstable and the majority of Crimeans never wanted to be ruled by Kiev anyway. They were ethnic Russians, by and large, speaking Russians and even holding Russian passports in a lot of cases. I've never spoken to a Crimean who lamented the events. So I have to ask: aside from Kiev losing land, what was the downside of Russia reclaiming Crimea from the Ukraine? 




 Kind of tacky, putting politics on a goodwill message like that. 




 Nothing changes in the Ukraine, I see. All that changes is foreign policy. My thoughts and best wishes go out to the Ukrainians. 




 Free speech, democracy, etc. 




 Georgia? I know we're turning blue, but did anyone actually think these would have a chance? 

(FWIW: I'd never stop voting for a pro gun Dem.) 




 Hunter S Thompson would have thought him adorable. 




 Krokodil Me. 




 Thought so. Words shall not be marked, OP. 




 No one likes SRS 




 Can countries be kicked out of the EU? I don't think they can. They can sure be made to feel unwelcome, however, and voluntarily withdraw. 




 There's a difference between telling someone something they're going to have a tough time after the collapse and telling someone they're just going to die. It's pretty shitty. 




 The lands that Russia is in were never Kiev's to begin with and never wanted to belong to the Ukraine. This is not hard to grasp. 




 Honestly, what would you even call the war in the Ukraine? The west and Kiev can't even seem to agree on the nature of the conflict and Moscow won't admit that it has people in the Ukraine. Then you have Crimea which arguably belonged to Russia anyway and the whole thing just collapses into a semantic clusterfuck.

I'm just going to call it The Great Soviet Tussle and be done with it.

 




 They adopt the tactics of the bigots they claim to loathe and are just as intolerant of "privileged" people as they claim the privileged are of the disabled, women, LGBTs, and minorities. SJWs are a useless, disgusting lot.  




 Do Christians believe that consciousnesses created by Man can get to heaven? What would an AI have to gain by being Christian? This pastor seems to be misunderanding why people would want to believe in a god. 




 Well sure, but speaking as a disabled person, we all know that already and it's needlessly douchy to point it out. 




 Report, downvote and move on.

Edit: What did I say? 




 Are the mods as pro-Ukraine as everybody else seems to be or what? 




 Paraplegic here. I've wondered this as well. Fortunately, my group of friends and I all have a really cohesive plan for a collapse of society and local order and I feel pretty good about that. My advice? Try to do the same if you have friends interested in prepping.  




 I don't know. I'm still not all that convinced. Next you'll be telling me that Leela's a mutant and not an alien. 




 Maaaaybe. I've got a full plate at the moment, but I'll see. 




 Nah. Defect to North Korea. Pays better. 




 They only yell all the time because they love me, too. Discuss? 









 Do it now, waffle boy! 




 For best results OC weapons and sing The Internationale in Korean. 
























 Basically, I have a shitload of obscure music from the Communist world of varying vintages, a level of skill at writing stiffly propagandistic radio copy, and a degree of experience with voice work. What I'd love to do is make a radio station for either FNV or FO3 that broadcasts as a service of the irradiated ghouls shambling around in the old Soviet embassy.

If this sounds like something you'd like to be a part of, let me know. I really only need someone with enough GECK know how to make all the audio that I level and produce to come out fine in the script and in game. As I have no plans to make any in game content, it should be a modest undertaking at its most difficult.

If such a mod already exists, I apologize for the seeming redundancy, but I'd dare to venture that my effort would make a worthy and immersive addition to any play through of either game.


UPDATE

I've recorded several DJ quips and have a nearly finalized selection of tracks I'm putting in. This is subject to change, and if you have any suggestions feel free to speak up. Chances are that I probably have it.

**Preview**

A preview of the mod is located [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkC6gsMCLzY)


**UPDATE 01/15**

Principal recording of DJ lines is complete. Track listing is complete. All that remains is placing and some audio post-production. I'm quite pleased with how everything has come together, and I'm pretty sure it even plays nice with canon and lore. I'll make another post once the whole thing is done, and I hope you all enjoy it.

To celebrate this milestone, [here](http://vocaroo.com/i/s1wZJvPoQRxa) is another preview of the DJ copy.
 




 What are North Korean attitudes on the fall of the USSR? I know that the DPRK is no longer technically a Communist state, but is there any sense that they lost an ally or fellow traveler? Do they regard it as a failing in Leninist thought that Juche has rectified? I've always been curious about Northerners feel about the Soviet Union and its fall. 




 Conditions assume that each party has only themselves and their respective skills to rely on. Atlas has his shadowy connections and skill set while Fitzroy is assisted at random and unknowable intervals by the Lutece twins. 









 The booze consumes the molecules you need to stay asleep, so you'll wake up early without fail. Do it! Do it, asshole! 




 I know that information is sparse, but I really wonder how the Soviet Union, Europe, China, Japan and Australia faired the various wars that ultimately consumed the world in and around 2077. Anyone got any hard sources or conjecture? I know Tenpenny claimed to have made it out of England, so we've obviously got something resembling global travel still. 




 It's a crime ridden hellhole. What the hell drives people to live or invest there? 




 Assuming that one would still qualify them as industrial, that is. 
























 Think about it. They've got the poor guy in jail. Their revenge could not be sweeter. 



















 Britain's cockney culture is characterized by a charming accent that is famous the world round for evoking images of chimney sweeps and Dickensian orphans. HOWEVER, there is an untold tragedy behind this distinctive brogue.

You see, the cockney tradition of calling strangers 'guvna' does not, in point of fact, stem from rhyming slang and the archaic term 'scrivener.' In fact, all cockney people suffer from a terrible and debilitating condition that leaves them unable to properly identify the current governor. Therefore, in a mixture of respect and a fear of terrifyingly draconian British laws regarding the failure to pay proper deference to government officials, cockneys are left with but one recourse:

Greet everyone as 'guvna.' 









 Greetings and salutations!

I'm an Atlanta area resident looking to get into voice acting and voice over work. I specialize in playing villains, but I can do just about anything. In addition, I dare say I've got the best mid-atlantic accent delivery in the amateur market. 

My rates are extremely competitive and open to negotiation, and my growing portfolio can be found at www.modernchristory.com. Thanks for giving me a look! I hope I'm right for your project! 

Feel free to contact me either through my site or via PM. 









 For all those currently relying on Skype and the like: hang in there! It gets better! My girlfriend and I met online and the day we met each other was the happiest day of our lives. We've been living together for over two years now, but we still look back to our days of falling asleep on Skype and chatting online fondly. Hang in there. You'll be together some day, and let me tell you: there's nothing more rewarding than that final visit to the airport.  




 Is there a central bank? Some manner of mint? Who standardizes these things and why are they good in every era with seemingly no change? 


































 You make a good case, son. A damned good case. 




 Swastikas 




 On the flip side, however, the military does discriminate against vast segments of the population, so I don't think it's safe to consider it a catchall. 




 Such liberalism! Such democracy! Good to see that the blood spilt on the maidan was not tragically, farcically wasted. Different faces, same bullshit.  . 




 ! Glad we ironed that out. 




 Simonov certainly could have managed it. 




 Ah! I thought you were talking technically, not conceptually. My mistake. 




 Nihil sub sole novum, eh? 




 See, Mikhail Kalashnikov seems like he was an awesome guy, and that's part of his appeal. The Soviets were fond of using poster boys to embody the labor of the working classes. In this system, the [Stakhanovite movement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakhanovite_movement), the work of many would be attributed to a single poster boy in the hopes that multitudes of workers would see said poster boy as a model to be emulated. The results of this were debatable, but it is certain that it was applied to more than just coal mining. 




 Except that the internal workings of the two weapons are wholly different. The StG has much more in common with European assault rifles than it does the AK-47. While they're aesthetically similar, the inner workings of the two machines couldn't be more different. 




 I'm sure it's already been said, but my only problem with the theory is how much Bobby looks like Cotton. Otherwise, this theory has been my operating headcanon for quite some time. 




 Well? It is, isn't it? It was mostly in what is now Russia and what holdings it had on Crimea count as Russian because we all know the Ukraine ain't getting that soil back. 




 But that's why this is wrong. A boycott would be saying that you care more about some people's issues than others. That's tremendously unethical. 




 I see what you're saying, but I still believe that those who support such a move are failing to consider people with disabilities and poor people, as well as anybody else who can't travel. I take issue with that on a lot of levels. 




 But why should people unable to do anything about it suffer for it? DC should just make donations to Democratic candidates or something. A boycott would hurt a ton of people to no real end. You can't fix an injustice with another injustice. 




 No matter what, moving is going to be a pain for people who had nothing to do with this. I hope the law fails, but if it passes I'm going to be pissed if Dragoncon moves and, unfortunately, won't be able to do a thing about it.

That said, they'll need a strong argument to get them out of their contracts.

Also, thanks for the upvote. 




 I get what you're saying, I'm just saying that it wouldn't hold up and any half decent lawyer could defeat that argument in arbitration. 




 "Hey, let's screw over our con goers for something they have no control over!" That would be, essentially, what they're saying if they moved and that is something nobody should condone. The waves they're making are at our expense, not theirs. If they want to sacrifice for the good of the cause, they can contribute to non Republican political campaigns. Don't shaft the disabled and the poor over it.  




 Dragoncon itself has never been hostile to gay people. This argument falls flat. 




 But I'm disabled. Traveling is a huge ordeal for me, bordering on impossible if it's too far. I don't take people's shit away and bother them for issues relating to disabilities. Theirs is an awful approach to activism that ends up hurting people who actually genuinely are on their side. Additionally, a lot of people can't afford to travel to Dragoncon and this is the only large genre convention of its size and type that we've got.

 You would be hard pressed to find anti gay sentiment at Dragoncon. Do something that'll hurt the republicans directly or something.

I'm probably going to get buried, but people need to consider the full ramifications of boycotts. 

tl;dr, no just read the damn thing.

Edit: downvotes? Is arguing for those who can't travel that detestable? Such tolerance! 




 If you sycophant hard enough, though, you could get a cushy dacha or something. 




 Stalin had the best mixtape of 1944, foreal. 




 Travel is a huge ordeal for me and Dragoncon has always been very convenient because of that. Let's not punish allies for the actions of boor headed conservatives. 




 Not to mention Target's whole, creepy history in customer tracking anyway... 




 Except for all the gay people and allies in Indiana suffering for this anyway. Sanctions and boycotts are really shitty that way. 




 Paging /u/StuartAshen. Be careful with your festering, expired food that might somehow be dangerous! 




 Hey, Andy, how far is Bikini Bottom from Rapture? How are diplomatic relations between these two undersea citystates? 




 Stolen land? Have you ever even spoken to a Crimean? 




 Because yours is an interesting country with a rich culture and history that our media does absolutely no justice to. The best way to learn about any country is to ask the people who live there. Thus, I am subscribed.


Greetings from the United States state of Georgia. 




 I could have sworn that was straight from Dworkin's festering gob. Oh well. 




 Didn't some radfem "scholar" of some renown once claim that all male sex is rape? I want to say it was Dworkin. 




 Sounds beautiful compared to current. I'll never get why people think we're better off without the Soviet Union. 




 I get the perception that a lot of people are worried about the con getting too family friendly and losing the nerdi-gras vibe. People get defensive about that, and I can see more underage attendees worrying them. 




 No need to put "DPR" in quotes. They've just as much right to their name as anybody else. 




 Of course not, but I hear far too many feminists claiming their movement is about *everybody's* gender equality, and I take umbrage with that assertion. It's quite clear that this is not the case and they should stop selling their movement as such a thing.  




 But if feminism really is about gender equality, shouldn't it just be called "gender equality?" Where are feminists on male issues?  




 Default mod, here. I've never spoken with her. She seems to be hands off, from what I can tell. Well, other than blanket bans on discussion of a certain con artist. 




  I love how everyone preaches that we should be politically correct and sensitive to every single minority ever, but it's perfectly fine to call the south as a whole one crazy set of backwards, raving, religious lunatics.

I see it all the damned time and it pisses me off. You can't joke about anyone ever because feelings. But the South? Oh, go right ahead! We're the national laughing stock and we just have to deal with it.  




 ***WHAT!?*** 




 What was the original? 




 When comics work dried up, Rob Liefeld moved into tattoo commissions.  




 Zelotic, dropping some knowledge bombs. 




 9x18 Makarov.  




 I can vouch for this. A friend of mine once shot a handgun while I had my earplugs out. Not a fun trip to the range, let me tell you. 




 I'm going to go out on a limb and say that if we're going to have executions, they ought to be public. I am against the death penalty, as I don't believe any nationstate to have a perfect enough judicial process to mete it out fairly and it's an extremely expensive thing to have around.

However, it is a civil process, and every citizen of a country ought to see how the sausage is made, so to speak. As an element of the justice system, such as open courts where such executees are sentenced, it ought to be done in public. 




 I can't imagine Ogelthorpe landing in South Georgia in anything but a blizzard and considering this state fit to establish any sort of colony, even a penal colony. 




 Simply put, people will be quick to find ways for truly horrible things to be hoaxes. It's easier to some than accepting that we live in a world where awful things happen for no good reason.

Besides, the anti gun lobby HAS been milking the hell out of it, and where someone is gaining, people are quick to look for blame. 




 Because their government is in disarray and the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing? 




 temporary occupied

Oh, that's cute. 




 I guess Kosovo isn't a state either, then. Or maybe being a nation has to do more with sovereign will than petty things like international recognition. I mean, if Transnistria isn't sovereign and it isn't run by Moldova, just what the devil is it? 




 I thought he was Jimmy.

Ol' Jimmy Palpatine. 




 Woo! 




 But Transnistria is an independent nation. The Ukraine has no right to interfere and its citizens shouldn't need to get Moldovan passports. 




 July? You could relocate to the surface of the sun and it would be more temperate than Georgian July. 




 Nah. I like it here, for all of its faults. My family has been here since the early 1800s, the culture appeals to me, and moving is expensive. I'll just crank my AC and don a cooled HAZMAT suit to leave my apartment, all while dreaming of some Dixie Siberia. 




 No! Now we have bugs, pollen, and swamp ass! Anything but winter in this state is a hellish slog through the blood soaked depths of perdition. 




 I can get that their trying to help their branding, but you don't do that by shafting one of your most productive employees. Poor form, Konami. 




 Your host is bad and you should feel bad. Full of redirect spam and everything on phones. Lousy. Stop using it. 




 I'm out of the loop, here. What did Konami do to Kojima? 




 Because you haven't got a horse in this race or anything. 




 I can't think of anything off the bat that could contradict this. Headcanon tentatively accepted. 




 "Sorry, dude." Never has a simple phrase been so infuriating. I'd have taken a bat to his face and irradiated his testicles if I was you. 




 I may well do that if no one gets to it first. I'm busy for the weekend, so I can't give it the time it deserves. 




 ShitRedditSays is most toxic? So unsurprised. 




 I have some aesthetic and story pointers, if you'd like to avail yourself of them. I've been dying to do a setting like this but haven't really had a way to do it. 




 Dieselpunk space opera! If I could see art deco capital ships slugging it out over an ecumenopolis where everyone has spiffy 1930s era uniforms, that'd be neato. I actually have quite a few ideas kicking around about this. 




 Because censorship is really annoying to some people? 




 Georgia here. Yeah, I'm nowhere near that brave. I keep my bumper stickers sci fi related. 




 Southern atheists: there are more of us than you'd think. Source: Georgia bound and god-free. 




 I think General Lee was always aware of the morally abhorrent nature of slavery, but he was overwhelmed by his love of Virginia - surpassing even his love of the United States. I think his moral nature must have eaten at him quite badly and he would definitely have been a very conflicted man during and after the war. 




 Everything Kiev does seems to make me want to hate the current administration in the Ukraine more and more every day. 




 That's really not their decision to make, is it? 




 Fuck yes. So pumped. 




 Burnblades? Sounds fun. I'm on mobile, but is there a Halopedia link? 




 I am not death myself, but I'm working on it. What can I do to help the cause, buddy? 




 I never understood why the Lamas and Tibetan independence are so popular with the western Left. It's a tremendously uneducated view of history to support such things. 




 I got my hopes way too raised over that. 




 Craplanta? Living near Atlanta, I can see that. So how about San Antonio Bay? 




 I always liked Detoilet more. Whatcha got for Atlanta? 




 Anyone want to design one for us and fill the void? 




 My girlfriend's grandfather fought with the Communists against the Japanese in the war. I can confirm that they would hate it. We'd probably end up with a rump state headed by Wang Jingwei's Guomindang in China seated in Shanghai or perhaps Nanjing and the surrounding area with Japan owning a huge swatch of China including Manchuria, perhaps Beijing and most of the northern areas of the country. Additionally, they'd hold Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and more. 

Their vassal states in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere would hold Indochina, Burma, Indonesia, Singapore, and most if not all of British India. Look for Subhadra Bose and his Japanese backers to have some very different ideas on where the final borders should end up. 




 *exasperated grunt* 




 Yep. I believe their intent was to depopulate the Soviet Union as completely as possible and destroy all traces of Russian culture, leaving behind a servile slavic remnant to act as factory labor and house slaves. If memory serves, something to that effect was already somewhat underway in the Ukraine by the time the Nazis were pushed out. 




 Reichskommisariat Moskau would likely not be a thing. The Nazis stated repeatedly that they wanted to wipe the city and everything it stood for off the map. Likely, they'd set up an administration in Leningrad, rename it Petrograd or some German equivalent, and set up the Gau for the region there. 




 They dug up his sister just to sling mud at him? What a disgusting cult. 




 But... But at the two minutes hate yesterday... I could have sworn we... 




 Crimea's Curse? Could this article be more slanted? 




 G4 hasn't been a thing in ages. This comic is very dated. 




  Ukrainian support never fell bolow 50%.

What? Do you even have any idea what you're talking about? Have you ever even met a Crimean? 




 This. People act like Russia is so hypocritical with regards to secession due to how they handled Chechnya, but the fact that Chechen rebels always wanted to set up a backwards caliphate should set it apart. No conscientious leader can allow a caliphate to arise on their territory. 




 Sad but true. Things like this don't fit the narrative. 




 I'm gonna need more info. I had no idea this was a thing. 




 Such is life. 




 I used to volunteer at the Maryland zoo. One of the polar bears in our zoo, Alaska, was born in captivity and was in a circus for all of her life. She was rescued and my mentor described what it was like when she first entered her exhibit. The first time she entered her exhibit was literally the first time in her life that she had ever set foot on the earth so, for the first week or so she loved to dig. It was very endearing and touching...until they realized she was digging way too much and they had to fill in the holes at night with a mini tractor and compact the earth. And when she first went for a swim in the pool in her exhibit she was even happier. It was amazing! Unfortunately she has died due to old age and kidney failure.

 I could buy that. 




 No, I actually got your point rather clearly. However, as what you said had pretty much nothing to do with my reasons for carrying, I saw no reason to address your comment. 




 I thought it was canon if you did enough mental gymnastics. I mean, nothing in BaS ever directly shot it down and they even referred to some BioShock 2 locations in game. 




  And the wheelchair doesn't make much of a difference.

It actually does. The entire point I was trying to make, which seems to have eluded you, is that I can't run from muggers and other scum as easily as others. As such, I feel a lot better using lethal defense. Unless you have a severe mobility impairment as well, you have absolutely no business critiquing that. 




 This article struck a lot of chords with me. Sterling find as always, /u/alllie. 




 I've also long been in favor of reopening our State mental hospitals. Europe has proven to have somewhat imitable models in this regard. 
I should have included something like that in my initial post, considering 
how shockingly and depressingly prevalent mental illness and infirmity are in America's homeless population. 




 Well, branch 09 in Bombay have finally delivered their Eva sir, but... um... Well, it's got no paint, is fighting off massive infections, its armor has rusted through nearly completely and we can't understand a thing the Eighth Child is saying due to his accent. Can we ask the Angels for a rain check, sir? 




 Why the Star Wars font? 




 To play devil's advocate here, a lot of places do this because they lack the resources to shelter and care for those homeless people. Where are they all going to go to the bathroom, for example? Where will they sleep? How are you going to deal with the increased crime, vagrancy and litter that inevitably follows groupings of homeless people? The actions taken to discourage homeless gatherings by some cities is understandable, but it also has to come with a program of humanitarian assistance: the construction and expansion of shelters and resources to get these people fed and in jobs. 




 Counterargument: I'm in a wheelchair. I can't really fight all that well and I can't flee for shit due to my awful mobility. I can't afford to trust anything *but* lethal measures for self defense. 




 *ding*

*ding*

 Obeeeeyyy!!! 




 He's a different animal entirely. I think he's beyond grouping. 




 Thanks! 




 Sauce? 




 It holds water, I think. Only an ignorant fool would think the government has no influence on the news cycle. 




 Well, that's an example of might makes right, the way you describe it. 




 Yeah, but Reddit and the US at large will never see this side of the argument. 




 Law is irrelevant if it doesn't conform to the will of the people. Crimeans don't want to be a part of the Ukraine, so they shouldn't be a part of the Ukraine. End of story. 




 And where can we buy it? 




 I am insanely eager to see how this turns out. If nobody comes up with something in a few hours, I'll try to come up with something. 




 Stick it in some milsurp furniture and she'll look like a champ. 3 my refinished WASR with Romanian donkey dong furniture. 




 Well, yeah. Yours doesn't? 




 It sure seems to be a contest, the way some tumblrs tack on as many acronyms as they can to avoid it. 

Anyway, living in the rural south, I have to wonder: what use is a shaky, ill defined concept to me if it does nothing to help the people around me and makes everyone feel terrible and guilty? I could make the leap across the chasm of illogical stupidity if it at least helped the people around me. 




 Privilege is a vague concept, at best. It does little to explain rampant poverty in predominantly white rural Appalachia, for example. It also does little to explain why social justice people seem to care so little for that cause, or for things like male mental health. Privilege is an interesting theory in abstract but makes little sense in the real world.

I say this as a disabled man, someone you'd probably consider unprivileged.  




 What in the actual fuck? 




 Headcanon accepted, but it doesn't really answer OP's question. 




 I applaud you on that, then.  




 I don't want to sound like a fascist, but if America offends you then you might not have any business being in America. I get that a lot of people can't afford to leave or anything, but the impression I got was that it was primarily immigrants being offended. Generally, you probably shouldn't move to a country if it offends you.


That said, our government is absolutely awful, but a flag usually represents a land and its people, not its government.  




 As a subscriber here and to /r/personalfinance, I was fairly confused. 




 In the same vein, trigger warning. 




 -111 points and three hours up? Wow. It takes integrity to leave such a thoroughly slaughtered post up. 




 Looks legit to me. 




 If you'd read below this comment, you'd see that I smoothed that out  with strawberryblonde yesterday. 




 Don't they have immigration requirements and doesn't it take money to get up there, bud? 




 And we'll never get that time back. Sad. :( 




 Sure. Let me just make more money, bud. Oh, and get rid of the medical and opportunity costs of my disability. That will help. 









 My apologies. That's a rather common thing for anti-gun people to trot out in gun discussions, so I sort of assumed what was going on here.  




 What's with anti-gun people and their fixation on tiny dicks? Can you lot not do any better than miserable ad hominem attacks? 




 I wasn't trying to argue with you or anything. Just pointing out that cops aren't always all that good with firearms, yet they're the ones that anti-gun people say should be allowed to have them.

As for the whole criminal justice thing, it actually is something of a source. It shows that I know what I'm talking about to a degree when it comes to police firearms training procedures. 

But if you want to be a dick, that's fine too. 




 A lot of cops are actually really awful with firearms. Escalation of force procedure and trigger discipline don't get near the level of attention they deserve during training.

 Was it night? Near a city? Did the gun owner have to walk anywhere? Sure, the school might be safe, but we don't know where the guy was from or where he was going. If he had a gun on him, to comply with the law, he'd have to wear it openly. I doubt they had a gun check, in any case.  




 I'd say it's more like keeping a fire extinguisher in your kitchen and by your electric panel even though you're not all that likely to have a fire. 




 Nah. Marchie lives in a place where grenades abound but nobody can count correctly. 

Poor, poor Marchie. 




  Get over your loss. 

Which loss, dare I ask?  




 Appealing to emotion is such a political way to argue. It's sort of like, you know, every debate about gun ownership ever. 

"Yeah, you may have an enumerated constitutional right to own and carry weapons, and gun owners by and large are responsible and trustworthy people BUT WHAT ABOUT DEAD CHILDREN!?" - Bloomstein Demands Whatever 




 I carry because I'm in a wheelchair, can't fight or flee for shit, and live in a high crime area. As soon as the world stops being a place where people need to defend themselves, I'll stop carrying. 




 That's a mature attitude that contributes a lot to the conversation. Thanks, webby. 




 That's a big deal to them? I live in Georgia and work retail. I've got about a million and seven customers who open carry every day. Nice folk, actually. Really friendly, love to talk about their guns and stuff. Michigan, you need to stop being so afraid of weapons. 




 I didn't need feels of this magnitude today, but by jingo 'ave I got them. 




  Is it still cel shading if it looks like an impressionist painting? 




 This is the best way to go about it. Even better is that if you black out while playing, you can wake up to wonder why Balmora is wiped out, a nude Nord is following you around and all of your ingredients have been consumed. 




 Most definitely. If it's a bullshit booze law, you can always find bible shit behind it. 




 That sounds awesome. All of that. I'm sort of envious and wish we weren't so sensitive about everything. 




 Yep. Nazi chic. In Japan and East Asia, nobody was really all that affected by the holocaust, so they look at Nazis as little more than bad guys who did bad things and looked fantastic doing them. Due to their detachment from the situation, it's seen merely as taboo and not endorsing racism and genocide to enjoy Nazi chic. Oh, and the swastika never got ruined over there.

This is a gross over simplification, of course, so if anyone wants to correct me on this, feel free.

 You'll hear no argument from me on the whole basic income thing. I've seen the science and sociology behind it. You're preaching to the converted. 

I'm not sure about your approach to mental problems however. Gradual reintroduction facilitated by a clinic system would likely be a better solution. This way, those who cannot be reintroduced are given a safe place to be treated and kept out of harm's way. 




 Something stupid. 




 I'd watch that. 




 On the face of it, yes. However, government and charitable services in most areas have already got their hands full with the housed poor in public housing and section 8. Very few places have anything left over for the homeless.

Ideally, we should close tax loopholes for the bourgeoisie, cut military funding, and use the surplus to fund mental health clinics and social services and education so that the homeless problem can be dealt with in the long term; but the powers that be have decided that this won't be done. Therefore, I stand by my belief that feeding the homeless isn't necessarily a good idea. A short term solution is to donate whatever you can to your local homeless shelter and community centers. 




 Even with food stamps and disability, I'm still barely making it. Being disabled, it would be awesome to have better job prospects or single payer healthcare, but fuck the working and disabled poor I guess.


AMA or whatever. 




 To be objective, doesn't feeding homeless people regularly draw in more from surrounding areas, putting more strain on local resources?

 I'm an attendant on one of those self checkout things. When I'm not too busy, I totally notice. I just don't paid enough to care. Seriously, no one does. Also, we have like one LP person who is never there and she's the only one authorized to directly intercede, so even if I told a manager or something it would be sort of pointless.

 It's why I use 'the' for the Ukraine. Dropping it feels arbitrary and it honestly sounds a whole lot better that way. 




 So is the mother brain damaged? I think I missed something.  




 Because Poroshenko isn't just another corrupt, capitalist oligarch at all. Maidan wasn't a farcical waste of blood, sweat and tears, either. 




 Saying 'the' doesn't take anything away from their sovereignty. I mean, there's THE Philippines and THE United States. The insistence borders on insecurity, if you ask me. 




 The Ukraine sounds better, though. 




 Does anyone know when international tourists are going to be let in? As an American, I'd love to see Crimea. 




 Is it really annexing if most Crimeans have been wanting to rejoin Russia since the Ukraine became independent? I wouldn't call it that, personally. 




 Well, I don't work at THAT Kroger, but anybody who works retail long enough will eventually become death seven times on the inside.

 I had assumed those were newly composed Prometheans at the time. It's been a while since I played Halo 4 and I always thought the Prometheans were rubbish anyway, so I may be wrong. 




 Georgia, here, too. I remember Roy and Sunny's flag debacle all too well. 




 So sad, but you are absolutely right. 




 But they're both great symbols. We shouldn't let bigots ruin swastikas or rebel flags for the rest of us. We should stop being offended. 




 The Battle Flag didn't always carry such connotations, however, and that's what I'm railing against. It used to be a symbol of rebelliousness and of the South and then racists had to go and ruin it for people. I mean, look at how it was flown by US troops in WWII and Vietnam and you'll see what I mean. It wasn't always so hateful in the post Civil War era. 




 I'm with you there. Name me an ethically sound megacorporation and I'll show you a green dog. 




 Ah. For some reason I had thought that the Quebecois had a flag wholly distinct from the provincial flag. I was wrong. Anyway, the South should have a flag because we're culturally distinct from the North. We've got a distinctive dialect, cuisine, styles of music and more. We've got a rich cultural history distinct from the rest of America and in most places, that's enough to warrant a flag. 

That you look down on the South as simply being distinct for slavery is rather telling of how much you know about us. I mean, by this *flawless* logic: 

The only difference between the South and North was slavery, so any flag that separates the South from the rest of the country will be looked at with considerable disdain. A regional flag would be looked at as a desire to be separate from the rest of the country, which is a pretty shitty message to send considering the reason for doing it the last time.

German nationalism is a bad thing, considering what it caused *last time.* American patriotism is a bad thing because of what it's caused. The South deserves a flag just as much as the US and Germany do, I think. You've not given me a single compelling reason why we don't. 




 But don't you see! That's not ours to tamper with! Never mind that we're improving crop yields and increasing disease resistance! /s

(FWIW, Monsanto et al do have some pretty deplorable business practices.) 




 I thought some piece of post war canon said that the Ark survived. The ecosystem has been fucked beyond belief, but the structural integrity of the station as a whole is more or less sound. Given long enough, monitors and sentinels will likely get it back up and running and churn out Installation 04 C. I'm sure that's Forerunner protocol.

Also, as Prometheans are tied to the Didact, I highly doubt they're anywhere to be found but Requiem.  




 Hardly seems morally superior, given its history.

Besides, the South is a distinctive cultural region. Cultural regions typically have flags - Quebec, for example.  




 The inclusion of Ayers Rock makes it feel much more Australian. I don't generally like Union Flag replacements, but this one is solid. Good on you. 




 The Stars and Bars is the one I wish we'd go after, especially since it's seen by many states as a benign replacement for the Southern cross. I mean, it was the first symbol of the Confederate government - a group that was pretty objectively bigoted and awful. It just sort of sucks that the South doesn't get to have a flag that isn't mired in controversy. 




 I agree with many of these, but the idea that we can have clean, sustainable development in the short term without nuclear power is idealist and foolish. The key is doing it safely. It can be done, but oversight of the strictist nature is needed in nuclear plants. 




 Probably the latter. Time was that it wasn't so racially charged and was just seen as a symbol of devil may care rebelliousness. Ever see the Muppet Movie? In the background of the carnival scene, there are all these kids waving Confederate battle flags.

I really wish we could go back to having such a carefree attitude about it. Maybe push the negativity onto the Confederate *national* flag, instead. 




 If you want to work in the business, but don't want to work - just whine about sexism. That'll get you in. 




 You should post this to /r/fantheories 




 The warm embrace of Khorne, brother. 




 Fair enough. You're pretty much right on the money, for what it's worth, if you were imagining that I come from a Lost Cause promoting background. I still rather like the South and the Confederate flag, even if we'd function poorly as a country and we revolted over slavery. It's just a shame that we were fairly objectively the bad guys, there. I mean, the North were genocidal, imperialist terrorists; so I don't guess there are any good guys in that war. 




 Plenty of other people said exactly what you did, though. Pardon my curiousity, but it seems sort of unneeded. 




 Not to be rude, but this thread is days old and other people already replied. Why push the point further? 




 This. I don't mind kids at all if they're not obnoxious and behave themselves. I'd never have one or anything, but if they're well behaved and respectful of their elders then that's just fine.

Such children are certainly the exception rather than the rule, however. 




 Yeah, I'm calling bullshit on it too. You almost wonder if he had a street name like that because he knew court personel using the word nigger would set people off. 




 Not to mention whenever I see or hear "the N word" it just reminds me of when everyone's in kindergarten, you know? There's that one snitch who rats people out for saying "the D word" or something. But that's strictly a pet peeve.  




 Bloomberg is so slimy. I find this move hard to trust. 




 Agreed. I believe the government should help the needy and prevent discrimination. Beyond that, I want them to leave everyone alone.  




 In that same vein, /r/Sharktits. 




 Doesn't censoring the word just make it look like we're all afraid of it? We can say the word 'nigger' when we're condemning it. It's a word. It only has as much power as it's given. That it was censored so many times in the article struck me as childish.

 They're also too chicken shit to actually do anything about gun laws that need to go away (looking at you NFA classification laws) because then people might stop paying dues. I love guns, but the NRA can go right ahead and fuck themselves. 




 Odd, the connotation that liberal has. It seems like it should mean one who wants to be left alone to do whatever, not someone who believes in laws protecting equality and social safety nets for the disadvantaged. It makes identifying myself politically rather tricky, from a strictly semantic point of view. 




 This subreddit fills me with such hope for the human race.

 And a large portion would rather be Russian than gravitate towards Europe. That should say something, too.

Oh, and I believe they already had access to that infrastructure under the terms of the lease of Crimea anyway. I could be wrong. 




 Nah, that's too reasonable for this thread. 




 Siezing? Most Crimeans didn't even want to be a part of the Ukraine and wanted to rejoin Russia. That's been pretty widely known since at least 1992. Agree with the Russians or not, they liberated Crimea. 




 When will people stop trusting Ukrainian sources? They're just as biased, if not moreso, than Russian sources. 




 I'm going to share that one with him. It'll amuse the hell out of him, I'm sure. 




 True story, backed up by my grandma and his album of pics from the occupation in Japan: he made Tech Sgt (or some other rate, I can't recall which at the moment) three times. He would often fight and box off hours and get busted down as a reprimand when their unit commander found out. Made decent money at it and to this day has good bone structure, so I imagine he was really good at it. 

So Hirohito had plenty to be afraid of. 




 That's a tough pill to swallow without reputable citations. Everything I ever heard made it sound like the man was against slavery.

Edit: meant to say 'without citation.' 




 My grandpa had me convinced that Japan surrendered not due to the Atom Bomb, but due to the fact that Hirohito heard he was coming. I was well into Kindergarten by the time I wised up. 




 I'm pretty sure he also wanted nothing but reconciliation after the war and had respect on both sides of the Mason Dixon at the time. I'm not sure OP is right about him not being a good guy. He just loved Virginia more than he loved the US and saw himself as raising arms in his state's defense. 














 So it is. 




 Seems I never heard their Republican anthem either. Damn, that's badass. 




 Nah. I've got one leg. It's nothing terrifying. I'm talking about his face. It's much more terrifying than I've every seen it on the show. That's a rape face.

Okay, maybe it's *as* terrifying as the show. 




 I'm not denying that Russia's helping them out *a lot* more than they're admitting, but I think that the rebel movement did indeed start out from within. After all, Russians in Donetsk have been campaigning for independence [since December, 2005](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donetsk_Republic_%28political_party%29); so it's not without merit. People had obviously wanted it from within, so it really matters little if Russia is helping them out.

Similarly, most Crimeans wanted no involvement with Kiev since 1992. What Russia did there was liberation, not annexation. The people wanted it, so Kiev's opinion is really moot.

With all that said, Russia's play in Novorossiya is really quite difficult to predict. Many experts in the field of defense analysis see them as wanting to fuel a perpetual destabilization of the region, a-la Abkhazia, Ossetia or Transnistria, in order to keep the Ukraine as a buffer state, as are Georgia (which I really wish we'd call Sakartvelo in English, but that's another matter) and Moldavia. Others see Putin as a Hitler-esque landgrabber who will add every former Soviet republic back into Russia and cement his place amongst the Tsars and Premiers.

It's really hard what to tell. He's made a lot of moves in a lot of different directions. I believe he thinks he's doing what's best for ethnic and linguistic Russians all over Eastern Europe and sees himself as a protector and restorer of [Greater Rus'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Russia). There's no doubt that he's deeply patriotic and his strong moral initiatives, however deeply wrong and misguided they may be, show a deep desire to guide the future of Russian society. 

My prediction is that if he could, he'd bring Russia's borders back to where they were in 1917. Since that's incredibly unrealistic, however, he'll likely be content to sieze parts of the former Soviet Union and destabilize neighboring countries as deeply as possible to keep NATO off his border while expanding the membership of [CSTO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_Security_Treaty_Organization), the [EEU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Economic_Union), and the [CIS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Independent_States) while expanding Russia's role and prestige within these groups for as long as he possibly can. The extent of that timeframe, however, is something I have no projections for.  




 Very likely. They're already listening to [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJcXzoFhBmM), anyway. All three, however, are more stirring and inspiring than the dour and depressing (though admittedly, emotional) anthem of the Ukraine, [Ukraine is Not Yet Dead.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzgViS4Rpf8) 




 But that sounds like rape. 




 A golden rock god? 









 Dennis looks absolutely terrifying. 




 I've always really liked the [National Anthem of the Donetsk People's Republic.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL-_S_HH3pw) Many wouldn't consider it a real country, however, which is sort of sad to me. 




 I thought there was no better anthem than that of the [Donetsk People's Republic.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL-_S_HH3pw) I was wrong. What is it with former Soviet lands and badass national anthems? 




 Well, if you have any suggestions on how to better run this sub, you're welcome to submit a mod message. You're rather quick to denounce us, but we care just as much about quality as you do, I assure you.

 I don't see what's so awful about it. Isn't that how voting in user submitted content aggregators is supposed to work? 




 Maybe people just like guns? I don't know. Reddit has always stricken me as pro-gun. I'm not all that surprised. 

Speaking of not surprised, I thought that this sub being mostly white was something of an open secret. 




 That's an adequate sentiment. I'm pretty sure camouflaging munitions flies in the face of some treaty or another, but I'm also pretty sure Russian armed forces weren't a party to said treaty. 

Anyway, I wasn't aware of such a kill record for the Bradley, but considering how many of them we had in theater and how outdated Iraqi armor was, I could quite believe it.

And you know, thinking about it, a lightly armored, upgunned, high speed tank that could be dropped out of a low flying C-130 to assist airborne infantry in rapidly destroying hostile objectives would be a sterling idea. I'd quite like to see that. It would be much more persistent than CAS missions or drone cover and the psychological impact of tanks in infantry warfare would make it a splendid piece of backup to augment any air deployed mission.

The only problem I could see would be getting it past acquisitions without having them butcher the thing.

Again, armchair military enthusiast. You probably know more about such things than I. Thanks for your service, by the way. 




 Brigaded as fuck? The submission is sitting on 3,583 points! That's hardly brigaded.

 If it's getting upvotes, that means someone's finding it creepy. If it's awful, report it. If enough people report it, we'll pull it. 




 People complained, we removed it. If it ain't creepy, report it. If enough people report it, it's gone. In this way, we can all work together to keep things creepy. 




 It's fine as a light tank, I guess, but isn't its place in modern doctrine somewhat dubious? Light tanks aren't really a thing. Their role has been filled by so many other systems that the whole armor thing was surrendered to main battle tanks. Therefore, the Bradley hasn't really got a tactical niche available to it that it can really excel in.

At least, that's my completely unprofessional armchair general evaluation. 




 Sure. This is a widespread and well known fact.

http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/02/16/listen-audio-of-bloombergs-minorities-and-gun-control-remarks-from-aspen/

The guy is a bigoted loon and his remarks show what I think is great insight into his thinking. Oh, and when you consider that most gun laws in the United States were enacted as tools to keep slaves and freedmen from liberating and protecting themselves, it doesn't set the best moral foundation for gun control as a movement.

NINJA EDIT: Let's not forget that these anti gun campaigners have armed bodyguards and famed anti gunner Dianne Feinstein not only owns a revolver but even has a concealed weapons permit. I think they just want to keep guns out of the hands of common people, the same sort of people who just so happen to often be asian, black, brown, and of other non-white ethnicities. Gun control is far more racist than gun rights. 




 Get this guy ten percent more votes! Maybe he can summon Exodia for us. 




 Also, Michael Bloomberg - a famed anti gun advocate - supports disarming black people. OP seems to have misidentified the racists when it comes to the gun rights debate. 




 And there's no one there to raise them if you did. 




 Huh. Yeah, it's identical. 




 Thank you!

 If you want to be technical, this difference is mostly academic to some Greeks. Indeed, many Greeks see themselves as the true and proper heirs to the Roman legacy. In fact, [an accepted ethnic self descriptor for the Greek people](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_the_Greeks#Romans_.28.E1.BF.AC.CF.89.CE.BC.CE.B1.E1.BF.96.CE.BF.CE.B9.29) is Rhomaioi, which descends from Rome. 




 Shouldn't it say "returned" to Greek control? It was Byzantine before it was Ottoman, after all. 




 Inspired by [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2v74dc/reddit_what_would_be_the_worst_2_in_1_product_ever/cof0qlr) thread some time ago. 




 There was anti-black sentiment everywhere. Still is. The South is just a lot easier to pin it on because it was much, much more visible here and because the Klan was founded here and lingered here a bit longer than it did in the Northeast. That's not to say that the north was free of racism, however. You've seen [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynching#/media/File:ThomasShippAbramSmith.jpg) famous picture of a lynching, right? Marion, Indiana. 1930. 

Further, Martin Luther King, Jr led a famous march against housing discrimination (again, the main form it seems that non-Southern racism seemed to take) in Chicago, delivering this quote:

"Northern blacks were forced to live in a white man's democracy, and while not legally enslaved, subject to definition by their race. In their all-black communities, they continued to build their own churches and schools and to develop vigilance committees to protect members of the black community from hostility and violence."

[Here is a Wikipedia citation that has further examples of yankee racism.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_segregation_in_the_United_States#In_the_North)

Now, again, publicly overt racism did linger a while longer in the South and persists still today in many parts south of the Mason-Dixon. However, the stereotyping of the South as the only racist region of the US is tremendously unfair to the region and all that we've done to bury these outmoded social mores.

I'd like to wager that we've come a long way, at least in my home state of Georgia. We've had black mayors in Atlanta for many years, black politicians elsewhere in the state, many of our wealthy and famous citizens are black, and we also sort of gave the world Martin Luther King, Jr. 

But this is all with somewhat scant research and just based off of conversations I've had with my grandparents about the era. While my expertise is history, I tend not to study social forces and racial dynamics as much as I study military history (principally of the US as a whole, the South, and Europe), so I will freely admit that I've got some details wrong. Therefore, you shouldn't consider this authoritative by any means. After all, I don't consider the Confederate battle flag by itself to be an evil thing and many take umbrage with that. (Note: the Confederate *national* flag is another matter and we really made a step backwards in Georgia by replacing our old flag with that.) That's another discussion, however, and I'm willing to bet that my premise of widespread racism is still quite certainly sound. 


Ninja edit: wow, that ended up being a longer rant than I thought it would be. 




 They certainly did in the north. They seemed to have a problem with that everywhere. But they didn't seem to get upset with how much money they had as long as black people weren't near them or around them. 

In the South, where pretty much everyone was poor anyway, it didn't seem to matter as much how close they lived - just as long as they weren't better off than white people *EDIT: or pursuing relationships with whites*. From what I've read and heard told, northerners were much more keen on keeping white parts of town white than that. But not knowing any old people from the north, I can't independently verify that. I just have my grandparents' stories to go off of. 




 Easy there, psycho. 




 I have heard it said that the north was just as bad as the South with racism, it was just expressed differently. In the South, for example, they wouldn't care how close black people got but it mattered how high they got. The inverse was true in the north. 

But that's just what I've heard.  




 That it does. 




 I want a prototype Soviet bullpup. Those things look awesome. 




 Kiev Post

Reliable journalism

Pick one. 

Still, it would be nice to see Novorossiya split off. They and Crimea clearly want no part of Kiev and the western half of the country's move towards the West. Why should they be dragged along? Slava Novorossiya. Slava Donbass. 




 And it's time for me to rewatch another show. 




 Not to mention that the Star Wars missile shield's efficacy is extremely dubious at best, at least according to several skeptical analyses. It's essentially a feel good tax pit. I mean, it takes the finest minds in rocket science to come up with solutions for taking out satellites with fixed orbits. That we could knock a MIRV ICBM out of the sky - fast moving, unpredictable missiles with variable targeting, mind you - is a very fanciful notion. 




 Many thanks. And good luck with your eye child, doctor.  




 Just another day. I've been on it since yesterday. It's not some sort of religious thing or anything, but my girlfriend is out of town and my own cooking is sufficient to make Chef Excellence himself retch, so I decided to see it as an opportunity to test myself and save the money that would ordinarily go to takeout for more constructive things.  




 It ain't a test of will for nothing, that's for sure. Many thanks! 




 And not a one of them was built before 1987. Shoutout to /r/RetroFuturism.  




 It's sort of the era when firearms technology wasn't *quite* fully matured, so we still saw a lot of experimentation and whatnot. Even cooler were some of the Soviet bullpup designs of roughly the same era. (Later, sure, but as I said - rough.) I mean, [look](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/TKB-011_rifle_1963_mod_Tula_State_Arms_museum.jpg) [at](http://41.media.tumblr.com/7a72e28a1515ba0c05c2bc27b8e75a19/tumblr_mt4turqlda1s57vgxo5_1280.jpg) [these](http://41.media.tumblr.com/47a9c5766f8652bdc6973df59d3a0377/tumblr_mt4turqlda1s57vgxo3_1280.jpg) [fucking](http://i.imgur.com/XJiuspE.jpg) [things!](http://i.imgur.com/OWju4GN.jpg) 




 I sort of wish they had, though. There were some really interesting prototypical weapons concepts floating around in 1959. 




 I'm not quite sure where to ask this, but this may be the best fit. Has anyone seen any reliable sites crop up with Donetsk People's Republic, Lugansk People's Republic, or Novorossiya conflict artifacts? I'm interested principally in flags, patches, and medals. 

As a side note, I've been looking for Transnistria militaria, too. 




 To be fair, we haven't totally phased it out. Yeah, it's in a DMR role now, but it's still used.

Also, perhaps they didn't think to use a prop futuristic rifle? 




 Go for it. 




 I enjoy raw potatoes, as well. I peel, and slice, and salt. Difference is, I soak them in boiling oil for a while. Makes all the difference in the world. 




 They defraud people. Torture isn't wholly unwarranted. 




 A gentleman I once knew worked in law enforcement. He told me to answer unusual phone numbers with "task force" or some variant thereof. It's sufficiently vague to make scammers shit themselves and go away - possibly delisting you, but not concrete enough to be incriminating or a legal offense. 




 I am a huge fan of Ashens - have been for years. Recently, I decided that as a test of will I'd go on a fast. Well, times got tough. In search of reinforcement to my fortitude, I turned to the [All Day Breakfast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueah-mOjDI) review. And then to the 30 Year Old Food Parcel. And so on in that fashion.

Fast saved.

You're a champ, Ashens. Keep doing what you do with your ungodly, cast iron stomach.  




 We should give her a euphemism for a dash of the ol' damnatio memoriae. BW is a good jumping off point. I vote Butt Wipe. Anybody got anything better? 




 Fuck pollen, I want winter back. 




 That works better as a gif, I think. 




 I love that gif. What's the source? 




 That is some top tier body horror. Damn. 




 Got a lex link?
 




 Shemaghs? 




 But the magic of black! 




 What we need to bring back is utility vests.
