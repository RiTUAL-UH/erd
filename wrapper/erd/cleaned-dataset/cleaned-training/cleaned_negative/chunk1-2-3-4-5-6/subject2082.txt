 Isn't that a very closed-minded, unfair and naive way of rating movies? For example, a movie without any actors or a silent movie without music would for example score 0 on acting and/or sound design automatically? 




 La femme qui se poudre (1972). 




 I use a scale from 1 to 5 to rate movies, so a perfect score is 5/5 for me. Here are the 26 movies that I've given the highest score possible:     


* Banshun (1949)     
* Un condamn  mort s'est chapp ou Le vent souffle o il veut (1956)       
* Smultronstllet (1957)     
* Jalsaghar (1958)     
* Hiroshima mon amour (1959)    
* Pickpocket (1959)   
* Le trou (1960)    
* La notte (1961)     
* L'eclisse (1962)    
* Nattvardsgsterna (1962)       
* Sanma no aji (1962)         
* Tystnaden (1963)      
* Suna no onna (1964)     
* Andrey Rublyov (1966)     
* Tanin no kao (1966)      
* C'era una volta il West (1968)    
* Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969)      
* Spalovac mrtvol (1969)      
* Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972)      
* Solyaris (1972)     
* Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)  
* Zerkalo (1975)      
* Stalker (1979)       
* Krhozat (1988)        
* Der siebente Kontinent (1989)    
* Stntang (1994)      




 It's far from one of my favourites, but it's indeed a good movie. One of Philip Seymour Hoffman's best performances. 




 It is! Quite good and gritty with a nice soundtrack. 




 I wouldn't care. 




 But then again, Iranian films overall have really bad distribution from the start. All of the movies I mentioned have at least been released on DVD. 




 Yeah, the best one of them all. Solyaris (1972) by Tarkovsky. 




 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Solyaris (1972). They're also way better in my opinion. 




 Five of my favourite Iranian movies:   

* Jodaeiye Nader az Simin (2011)   
* Khaneh siah ast (1963)   
* Nema-ye Nazdik (1990)  
* Nun va Goldoon (1996)   
* Ta'm e guilass (1997)   


Five other Iranian movies really worth seeing:    

* Avaze gonjeshk-ha (2008)   
* Ayneh (1977)     
* Gaav (1969)    
* Sib (1998)   
* Ten (2002)   

Kiarostami's Koker trilogy is of course a must see too, but I tried not to only name movies by him. But be sure to watch Nema-ye Nazdik (1990) and Nun va Goldoon (1996), those two are great gems from Iran. Nun va Goldoon (1996) is also directed by Mohsen Makhmalbaf, Samira Makhmalbaf's father. 




 I've seen it. Not that horrible, but too thin, simple and a bit superficial for me to like it more. I got the feeling that the movie wanted to be too much at the same time. 




 It's not really one of the top choices for me at all when it comes to what I want Criterion to release. I would rather see a release of Gummo (1997) then. 









 Your choices are not bad. My list would probably look like this:     

1. Spalovac mrtvol (1969)       
2. Les yeux sans visage (1960)       
3. Possession (1981)     
4. Onibaba (1964)       
5. Yabu no naka no kuroneko (1968)      




 Two-Lane Blacktop (1971). 




 Mulholland Dr. (2001). 




 Hiroshima mon amour (1959), 90 minutes of perfection. 




 Tanin no kao (1966), Stalker (1979) and Solyaris (1972). 




 Hiroshima mon amour (1959). 




 Dead Man (1995), his best one. 









 Solyaris (1972) of course. 




 Stalker (1979). 




 Andrey Rublyov (1966) and Marketa Lazarov (1967) are both amazing in their realism. Both of them are dealing with a main character each, but they also portray rivalry. The first one dealing with the fighting between rival princes and the Tatar invasions, while the last one deals a lot with two different clans. Both movies also deal with religion and how it affected the Middle Ages. 




 I would say that these ten are the best ones:    

* Antichrist (2009)    
* Eraserhead (1977)       
* Hxan (1922)              
* Krkarlen (1921)   
* Les diaboliques (1955)           
* Les yeux sans visage (1960)      
* Onibaba (1964)      
* Repulsion (1965)    
* Rosemary's Baby (1968)    
* Yabu no naka no kuroneko (1968)     




 Edipo re (1967) by Pier Paolo Pasolini. The screenplay is adapted from the famous Greek tragedy by Sophocles. The movie starts for example in pre-war Italy, but the setting is later changed to the ancient world. Probably worth to know. But basically almost the entire movie is set in the ancient world. Good stuff. If you want a good biblical story, check out Il vangelo secondo Matteo (1964). That one is also directed by Pasolini and is a great and interesting retelling of the story of Jesus Christ. 









 Have you seen Stalker (1979)? One of the best science fiction movies ever. 




 The controversy surrounding Greed (1924) by Erich von Stroheim is very interesting. There's some stuff written down about it on [Wikipedia](http://tinyurl.com/yfy9vl6). 




 Nice stuff. That movie is truly a masterpiece. 









 My top three:    
1. Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)     
2. Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972)    
3. Belle de jour (1967)      









 They'll probably show up soon. I just think we have to wait some more. Nothing else to it. 




 The ending of L'eclisse (1962) is fantastic. 




 Ten of my favourite horror movies that shouldn't be missed out:    

* Eraserhead (1977)   
* Hxan (1922)   
* La chute de la maison Usher (1928)    
* Les yeux sans visage (1960)    
* Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens (1922)    
* Onibaba (1964)     
* Possession (1981)   
* Repulsion (1965)     
* Spalovac mrtvol (1969)   
* Yabu no naka no kuroneko (1968)     




 Are you referring to Meatballs (1979) by Ivan Reitman? If so, it already has been released on Blu-ray. [Here](http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Meatballs-Blu-ray/427/) is the US version and [here](http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Meatballs-Blu-ray/41364/) is the Canadian one. 




 I don't know if I would call that an essay really, but then again, that term could be quite vague. Most of it consisted of objective facts. I was expecting something more and critical. It didn't give me any new insights either. Anyways, it's always nice to see Tarkovsky getting some space here. It's a great film nonetheless. 




 He truly was! Yeah, I love that picture too. They were so cute. And I like what Kurosawa said about his movies:     

*"To not have seen the films of Ray is to have lived in the world without ever having seen the moon and the sun."* 




 I've seen several threads about it here. And it gets mentioned now and then in all kinds of places. It's even the most successful Irish film of all time if you look at the box office. The reception for it was mainly positive, there's somewhere over one hundred reviews for it at Rotten Tomatoes for example. So I wouldn't say that it's an unknown movie really. It also won some awards and got some nominations.     

But to contribute with a film to the thread, I'll say Tobenai chinmoku (1966) by Kazuo Kuroki. I posted about it in similar threads before, but I can't recommend it enough. To take an example, only 148 users have rated it on IMDb. It's rarely mentioned overall. It doesn't even have an official DVD release. I hope it gets a Blu-ray release one day, it really deserves it, or a double format release. One of the most underseen masterpieces of Japanese cinema of all time. Such a great film. 




 Scandinavia. 




 Well, the Blu-ray releases by Criterion are not the same region as the standard region in Scandinavia for example. So you have to get a region free player or one that plays that certain region to be able to watch them. Or do something else. It's a lot easier with DVD releases though, that's usually no problem to fix. 




 Because I use it as a standard on the Internet. English isn't my first language. And I don't like some English titles, so I always stick with the original ones, as those are the original titles and nothing else. Also, every movie has an original title, some movies don't have English titles at all, so I don't want to mix it either. 




 I don't like region codes at all either, it sucks. Especially for us in Europe when it comes to Criterion for example. And a good region free Blu-ray player seems to cost quite a lot too. 




 I don't know if you missed it, but there's already several Blu-ray releases of it. One [German](http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/The-Adventures-of-Buckaroo-Banzai-Across-the-8th-Dimension-Blu-ray/86439/), one [Spanish](http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/The-Adventures-of-Buckaroo-Banzai-Across-the-8th-Dimension-Blu-ray/124960/) and one [Australian](http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/The-Adventures-of-Buckaroo-Banzai-Across-the-8th-Dimension-Blu-ray/98243/). Arrow Films is also releasing it in July this year, [here's](http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/The-Adventures-of-Buckaroo-Banzai-Across-the-8th-Dimension-Blu-ray/128699/) a link to that one. 




 If you mean Gallipoli (1981) by Peter Weir, it actually got released on Blu-ray today. There is [this](http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Gallipoli-Blu-ray/125128/)	edition and also [this](http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Gallipoli-Blu-ray/125494/) one.      

Anyways, ten movies I have seen that should be released on Blu-ray:         

* Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969)   
* La maman et la putain (1973)   
* Mujo (1970)   
* Pisma myortvogo cheloveka (1986)   
* Quatre nuits d'un rveur (1971)    
* Shinj: Ten no Amijima (1969)    
* Spalovac mrtvol (1969)   
* Suna no onna (1964)    
* Tsuit no zawameki (1988)    
* Un homme qui dort (1974)   

And ten I haven't seen that really need to be released on Blu-ray:       

* Al-mummia (1969)    
* Ashani Sanket (1973)   
* Der brennende Acker (1922)   
* Gu ling jie shao nian sha ren shi jian (1991)   
* Khesht va Ayeneh (1965)     
* L'amour fou (1969)     
* La nouba des femmes du mont Chenoua (1979)     
* Ragbar (1972)    
* Tobenai chinmoku (1966)    
* Qing mei zhu ma (1985)     









 Well, the big studio flicks are the ones that gets the general public excited and hyped, there's no doubt about that. I'm not a big fan of Marvel from the beginning, so I don't really get let down by their movies, because I know quite much what to expect from the beginning. I would say that the best movies usually (or more like always) are those that aren't a part of Hollywood, Disney and Marvel. 




 Can't say I'm excited for any of those really. At least there's other interesting stuff coming. 




 La peau douce (1964), Viskningar och rop (1972), Sanma no aji (1962) and Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972) are some of my favourites when it comes to the latest releases. Sanma no aji (1962) was an upgrade though, I don't know you count that too. It's going to be interesting to see what's coming in the future, they'll probably announce new releases quite soon. 




 Film Comment and Sight   Sound (also published by BFI) are great and interesting sources, as someone already mentioned. IMDb is great for information mostly, like production details, cast, filmographies etc. There's really no other site that is as universal and complete as IMDb when it comes to that. Be sure to check out the external reviews by critics on IMDb though, you will found links to many different sites (including Sight   Sound) that together will give you a massive amount of all kinds of reviews. 




 Is it sad that people are different when it comes to taste? 




 Popil i diament (1958) by Andrzej Wajda. And yes, it's great! One of the best polish films ever made. It's a powerful depiction of war and how it can affect a person's choices. The cinematography is also beautiful and especially Zbigniew Cybulski is fantastic in his role. Probably the best movie dealing with Poland's war and post-war history. If you have the slightest interest in cinema, this movie shouldn't be missed. 




 Well, Murph also wanted him to go find Amelia, so he also had a reason to leave. I think Murph mostly was satisfied with Cooper keeping his promise, that he would return to her. I don't think one should put that end scene you mentioned as the main focus, how long he stayed there or how long he didn't. I didn't like the movie, but for me, it was entirely because of other reasons. 




 There's no set release date yet. I think they will announce new releases in a couple of hours or maybe in a day or two, they usually do it in the middle of the month, so we'll see if it's going to be announced. If not, I'm sure it will come in the near future. 




 It looks probably amazing. It seems that it will be released by Criterion on DVD/Blu-ray too, which sounds even more amazing. And I hope they will restore more of Ray's work soon. 




 It's not my favourite by Bresson either, but it sure is a great movie. I love how powerful it as and still so minimalistic and spare. I'm a big fan of Bresson's special film theory and his rules, so this is entirely a movie in my taste. Everything is stripped down to the barest essentials. Every composition is well-thought out, everything we see is supposed to be there and Bresson really knew what was important and what was not. The editing is totally uncompromising and unbending, everything is beautifully shot at the same time too. The movie overall is claustrophobic and gloomy. I also like how it's quite deprived of humor, drama and feelings, but still manages to be powerful and nuanced without villains and heroes. Bresson's movies were special, there's really nothing like them. I think this movie is a magnificent reconstruction. I have to rewatch it soon! Bresson surely was a master. 




 Interesting stuff. Polish cinema really has some gems to offer. He's picked out some great ones. It's just too bad that I live thousands of miles away from the cities that are having the event. 














 The Game (1997)? 




 I would also say that it's one of the best silent movies ever made! It's very special and well done. 




 Great! I hope you'll like it! 




 If you haven't seen Repulsion (1965) by Roman Polanski, it's of course essential. 




 Here's 15 documentaries I think would be very interesting to see in the collection:     

* Araya (1959)    
* As I Was Moving Ahead Occasionally I Saw Brief Glimpses of Beauty (2000)    
* Dead Birds (1963)    
* Dialogue with a Woman Departed (1981)    
* Diaries Notes and Sketches (1969)      
* Feng ai (2013)    
* Forest of Bliss (1986)   
* Fragments of Kubelka (2012)    
* Ladoni (1994)   
* Pour la suite du monde (1963)    
* Pripyat (1999)   
* Resan (1987)    
* Sayonara CP (1972)    
* Taiga (1992)     
* Tiexi qu (2002)    

Since I haven's seen them, I can't say why and so, but they just look very interesting and I surely want to watch them. It's also intriguing when Criterion releases stuff you haven't seen. Also, some of them don't have Blu-ray releases either, which would make it even more fitting. 




 Sure, I've seen 26 of his movies and from what I have seen, he surely is one of the great ones. These are my three absolute favourites:   

* Nattvardsgsterna (1962)     
* Smultronstllet (1957)    
* Tystnaden (1963)       

Some other essential ones in my opinion:    

* Ansiktet (1958)   
* En passion (1969)    
* Fanny och Alexander (1982)    
* Hstsonaten (1978)   
* Jungfrukllan (1960)    
* Persona (1966)       
* Skammen (1968)   
* Ssom i en spegel (1961)   
* Viskningar och rop (1972)  

I can also recommend his TV mini-series Scener ur ett ktenskap (1973). 




 I have only seen the first one, but I thought it was very silly, ridicilous, boring, ugly and mostly full of bad comedy. I guess I'm not a fan of the childishly Disney tone it has. 




 I know at least that I would have Werckmeister harmnik (2000) and No Quarto da Vanda (2000) on my list. 














 Stanley Kubrick. No doubt about it. 




 Yjinb (1961) is a good starter that's quite accessible. I don't know if you have seen Per un pugno di dollari (1964) by Sergio Leone already, but that movie is basically a remake of Yjinb (1961), so if you watched it, you will probably recognize the story. If you don't mind the length and have no problems with it, Shichinin no samurai (1954) isn't really a bad choice either. It also has pretty much every key element Kurosawa is known for, so you will get quite a good overview if you start with it. If you don't want to start with a samurai flick, I would go with Ikiru (1952), it's easy to like and has a quite sympathetic story that's easy to relate to. I know many that started with Rashmon (1950) and loved it, it isn't one of his longer films, so that is one option too. It's a bit more complex than Yjinb (1961) though. 




 They do! Two good movies! 




 The Room (2003). 



















 Isn't it quite obvious that the majority of people hanging out in this subreddit really likes superhero movies? Look at the news, the discussions and what gets upvoted, it's quite easy to tell if you've been here a while. By the way, I don't know if your second question was meant to be the same as the one in the topic or if you meant anything specific about the industry? 




 Isn't this a great opportunity for you to rewatch the movie then? And isn't it supposed to be you choosing what you yourself think are the best negotiation scenes? It seems like you aren't trying at all. 









 I don't know if I would say that he's that underrated, but maybe not recognized enough and that his movies are quite underseen would be a better description. As for the downvoting thing, it seems that users on this site tend to downvote quite much that they've never heard of or anything similar overall. I don't really like the voting system at all, but that's another discussion. Anyways, Terayama did some good stuff! 




 Well, as I already said, the site isn't anything for me and I won't use it in the future. I don't use any similar sites either. I was just curious about what the suggestions are based on and adding a bit of contructive critique.

There's already similar sites with different filters too:     
[http://agoodmovietowatch.com/](http://agoodmovietowatch.com/)      
[http://www.suggestmemovie.com/](http://www.suggestmemovie.com/)

[http://5000best.com/movies/](http://5000best.com/movies/)       

That's just some examples. So your friend should try to come up with something special that makes his site differ from the lot. If he wants to make his site unique. Maybe he doesn't. 





































































































































































































































 It would be interesting to know how many Korean films the person who did the list actually has seen. And maybe it would be easier to add "from 2001 and forward" or something similar, because there's only movies from 2001 and forward on the list. 




 Der siebente Kontinent (1989). 




 Three of my favourites when it comes to coming of age films:    

* Den-en ni shisu (1974)    
* Les quatre cents coups (1959)    
* Sho o suteyo machi e deyou (1971)     




 Not that bad. He's not always acting in the best movies though, but Dead Poets Society (1989) and Before Sunrise (1995) are worth seeing. If you started with Linklater's trilogy, you should probably see all three movies too, Hawke is good in all of them. The first one is the best for me. 




 What are the recommendations based on? 




 El espritu de la colmena (1973). 




 Great Imamura movie! Thumbs up. I remember I uploaded a still from it on this subreddit about a month ago. 




 Favourite underrated movie: The Limits of Control (2009)    
Favourite relatively unknown movie: Tobenai chinmoku (1966)      




 Play (2011) by Ruben stlund. 









 [Here](http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/cannes-first-poster-images-and-synopsis-for-apichatpong-weerasethakuls-cemetery-of-splendour-20150504) are some images from the film and some more information posted quite recently. 
























 Koroshi no rakuin (1967) and Yjinb (1961). 




 Yes. 




 Well, because I put it in the list of the films I haven't seen yet, I think that tells if I liked it or not. It doesn't have a proper DVD/Blu-ray release at all, I would love to see it restored in great condition and put out on Blu-ray. 









 Du rififi chez les hommes (1955). 




 I'm a big fan of Art Theatre Guild (ATG) from Japan. Some great movies they released:         

* Bara no sretsu (1969)     
* Kshikei (1968)     
* Mujo (1970)        
* Shinj: Ten no Amijima (1969)       
* Sho o suteyo machi e deyou (1971)       




 Onibaba (1964), Spalovac mrtvol (1969) and Possession (1981). 









 Watch Solyaris (1972) if you haven't done it. 




 Yes. 




 1. Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975) (Chantal Akerman)    
2. White Material (2009) (Claire Denis)      
3. Khaneh siah ast (1963) (Forugh Farrokhzad)    




 Bulle Ogier. 









 I love it! It's one of my favourites, also the best prison film in my opinion. The suspense is amazing. 









 I think I'll go with Aguirre, der Zorn Gottes (1972). But Fitzcarraldo (1982), Stroszek (1977) and Lektionen in Finsternis (1992) aren't far away from the top either. 




 The Tragedy of Othello: The Moor of Venice (1952). 




 Narayama bushik (1958) and The Holy Mountain (1973). 




 1. Se7en (1995) 3/5     
2. Zodiac (2007) 3/5   
3. Fight Club (1999) 2/5     
4. Panic Room (2002) 2/5    
5. The Social Network (2010) 2/5    
6. Alien 3 (1992) 2/5    
7. Gone Girl (2014) 2/5   
8. The Game (1997) 2/5    
9. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011) 2/5     
10. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008) 2/5      









 I have seen the Imamura movie, which was really good. But I know of the two others of course. 




 Vozvrashchenie (2003) fits in with pretty much when it comes about brothers arguing. And that part about a friend involved, there is a minor scene in it where it also happens. 




 I just watched Vozvrashchenie (2003). Not a bad one. I wish I had some Coca Cola now. 




 The ten I would recommend the most:     

* Andrey Rublyov (1966)    
* Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972)     
* Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)    
* L'eclisse (1962)    
* La notte (1961)    
* Nattvardsgsterna (1963)        
* Pickpocket (1959)    
* Smultronstllet (1957)     
* Suna no onna (1964)   
* Tanin no kao (1966)      




 Stntang (1994), a bit over seven hours long. A true masterpiece. There you have real comedy that's black as night. 




 I hope no one takes this seriously. For example, movies like Sinister 2 (2015) and Poltergeist (2015) didn't have their premiere yet, I don't even think the person who did the video actually saw them. And The Babadook (2014) was from last year. It didn't seem that there was much effort put to work here. It looks like something a 14 year old kid did who just found out about Internet and YouTube. 




 Me too! It's one of the best movies I have ever seen. Just rewatched it some days ago. Such a masterpiece. 




 Some examples:    

* Duelle (une quarantaine) (1976)   
* L'immortelle (1963)   
* La maman et la putain (1973)   
* Le rvlateur (1968)   
* Un homme qui dort (1974)      




  I love it and I hope Criterion releases it on BD.  

They did it almost two years ago. 




 Wasn't it obvious? Nolan and Zimmer are hitting on the big drum with a ton of exposition and bombastic music that clearly tells you where you're supposed feel excitement and when you are expected to be sad etc. It's almost like a parody. As I've said before, the big problem with Nolan is that he isn't able to tell with pictures. 









 I agree that this is a must see. If you haven't seen it, do it. Probably Fellini's best one. 




 Possession (1981). 




 I thought it was horrible. I can recommend Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964) though, that's a good comedy film. 




 I think they should replace him with Michael Haneke. 




  Well this was actually Jonah Hill's idea.       

And that still doesn't rule out that he isn't a part of Hollywood. 














 Seems like Hollywood are out of ideas and looking for a cheap money grab. I can't see how it would turn out to be anything near good. The franchise milking nowadays is insane. 









 Pretty much all of my favourites are dramas, so my list would be like this:   

1. Der siebente Kontinent (1989)   
2. Andrey Rublyov (1966)   
3. L'eclisse (1962)   
4. Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)    
5. Tanin no kao (1966)   
6. Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969)    
7. Suna no onna (1964)   
8. Hiroshima mon amour (1959)   
9. Nattvardsgsterna (1963)    
10. Stntang (1994)    









 Hana-bi (1997). 




 The last one was from November 11, 2014 to December 1, 2014. And it was 50% off. 




 Hard to make a top ten, but I think it would look like this for me:   

1. Hiroshima mon amour (1959)    
2. Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969)    
3. Stntang (1994)     
4. Zerkalo (1975)    
5. Solyaris (1972)   
6. Nema-ye Nazdik (1990)     
7. Belle de jour (1967)  
8. Tobenai chinmoku (1966)   
9. Saraba natsu no hikari (1968)    
10. L'anne dernire  Marienbad (1961)    




 Both are good, but I would go with Fassbinder! 




 It will be in English. Subtitled in Swedish. 




 I haven't seen all of them yet, but of the eleven films I have seen by him, Kshikei (1968) and Shinjuku dorob nikki (1969) were the ones I liked best. 




 Such a great and funny shima movie! 




 L'eclisse (1962). 




 Das Leben der Anderen (2006) is a good political drama/thriller. It seems to be available on DVD if you rent it through Netflix, I don't know about streaming though, I don't have the American version of the program. 




 Here's six of my favourite movies about World War II:   

* Die Ehe der Maria Braun (1979) (Rainer Werner Fassbinder)     
* Idi i smotri	(1985) (Elem Klimov)    
* Ivanovo detstvo	(1962) (Andrei Tarkovsky)    
* L'arme des ombres (1969) (Jean-Pierre Melville)   
* Lacombe Lucien (1974) (Louis Malle)    
* Voskhozhdenie (1977) (Larisa Shepitko)    

I don't know how many you've seen, but you maybe could have missed some of the ones I namedropped. All of them are great, I hope you'll find something that can be of your taste. 




 Hollywood wants more money. 




 Sounds like a bad idea. 




 C'era una volta il West (1968) has probably my favourite film score. The best part is the duel towards the end. 




 The only movie from 2010 and forward I might put in my top 100 when I do it next time would be Norte, hangganan ng kasaysayan (2013). 




 Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972) and La maman et la putain (1973) are both fantastic. 














 Csillagosok, katonk (1967) and Idi i smotri (1985) are great. 




 Congratulations. It's a great movie. 




 I have to agree with the one who hated it. I also did. Overly dramatized, stupid, sentimental and melodramatic. Everything is so excessive to the point that it just makes it silly to the max, from the jokes to the drama and messages. For me, it's a wonder that people like this so much. 




 Woody Allen. 









 In a Lonely Place (1950). 









 Here's my top 10 films under 100 minutes:        

1. Nattvardsgsterna (1962) (81 minutes)       
2. Hiroshima mon amour (1959) (90 minutes)    
3. Smultronstllet (1957) (91 minutes)      
4. Pickpocket (1959) (75 minutes)     
5. Spalovac mrtvol (1969) (95 minutes)      
6. Tystnaden (1963) (96 minutes)      
7. Un condamn  mort s'est chapp ou Le vent souffle o il veut (1956) (99 minutes)     
8. Nema-ye Nazdik (1990) (98 minutes)      
9. Une femme est une femme (1961) (85 minutes)      
10. Gion bayashi (1953) (85 minutes)      














 The Limits of Control (2009). 




 He needs to learn how to tell with pictures. 




 Hard to choose only one, but I've always held City Girl (1930) by F.W. Murnau very high, so that will be my answer. 




 [Here's](http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/173-8-1-2-a-film-with-itself-as-its-subject) a little essay by Alexander Sesonske that maybe could help you a bit on the way. 




 Sanma no aji (1962) with sake. 




 Woody Allen. 




  1. Do you recommend me watching it in one sitting or multiple?      

I would recommend to start watching it early in the day, that way you have some hours to spare. The whole movie is split in parts, so that makes pauses quite easy. So if you need a pause, it's easy to find some time for it, the movie allows it. I think it's best to pause where you feel like, whether you for example have only one break or maybe two or three. One pause in the middle is probably the most essential.      


 2. Does the length ruin the film in the sense that it becomes boring or self-indulgent? (I've always wanted to see it, but I'm slightly teased by the idea that I might be wasting seven hours of a day watching a film which I won't like, plus the fact that the DVD boxset of the film is a tad pricey)       


I would rather say that the length does the opposite. Sure, it's maybe not a movie you put on every other day, but if you allow to immense yourself into Tarr's world, you're in for a treat, especially if you liked his other movies. Stntang (1994) gave the a certain resolved feeling of time after while, I think Tarr was very good at doing it. It felt hypnotizing and sometimes you didn't really know how many of the hours actually passed. If you liked the Tarr movies you've seen so far, there's no reason why you shouldn't watch it!       

 3. How does it compare to other Bela Tarr films in terms of quality and themes? Is it better than most Tarr films, the best? Is it similar or different in some ways?      


Werckmeister harmnik (2000) has for example a bit more surrealism, considering the whale and such. The narrative structure isn't as in his other works either. Everything is divided into twelve parts and it jumps six moves forward, then six back. Also, the doesn't always move chronologically. But maybe you already know that. If not, it's good to know and to be prepared. I'm almost done reading the novel the movie is based on, it also has the same structure. The mood in Stntang (1994) is quite similar to Werckmeister harmnik (2000) and A torini l (2011), but the themes are not maybe exactly the same. You'll recognize some things from his other films though, you'll get quite much nihilism, just like in A torini l (2011), And it's very existential.       
Stntang (1994) is visually very much like Werckmeister harmnik (2000), A torini l (2011), A londoni frfi (2007) and Krhozat (1988). You'll get the black and white photography and of course the long takes. You'll probably recognize the environments as well, there's many crumbled buildings and hopelessness almost everywhere. When Tarr did Krhozat (1989), it was at this point where he started with his later metaphysical style, so you probably know that all of his movies before that one were very different and more social realistic with a raw, documentary feel over them. About his best film, I really think I hold Stntang (1994) as his biggest masterpiece. It's just amazing. 




 Der siebente Kontinent (1989). 




 There's no news about it for the moment. It hasn't even premiered anywhere yet, so it's a bit early to tell. You should keep an eye out on IMDb though, it will likely be posted there when it's official. 




 Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972). The movie has an all-female cast and is set entirely in the home of the main character. So good. 




 Well, you always have IMDb, even if it's obvious. There's also external reviews there. You also have [AsianWiki](http://asianwiki.com/) and [Midnight Eye](http://www.midnighteye.com/) too, the later one has a focus only on Japanese movies too. But my best recommendation would be A Critical Handbook of Japanese Film Directors: From the Silent Era to the Present Day by Alexander Jacoby, a great book.
 




 * La libertad (2001)      
* Liverpool (2008)    
* O Pagador de Promessas (1962)      




 Les quatre cents coups (1959), Sho o suteyo machi e deyou (1971) and Den-en ni shisu (1974) are some of the best ones. 




 I used the original title, but it's also called that, yes. 









 Du rififi chez les hommes (1955) and Le cercle rouge (1970). 




 A shame to ruin such a good tribute with such a terribly mediocre and dull composer as Zimmer. 




 It seems good enough for the general public as it is now. Just look at the kind of money the movies are making and their big fanbase/praise. A majority of the critics love the big Marvel movies too. 




 So? 




 I think my list would look like this:     

1. Banshun (1949)     
2. Genroku Chshingura (1941)   
3. Double Indemnity (1944)    
4. Vredens dag (1943)   
5. Les enfants du paradis (1945)   
6. The Third Man (1949)   
7. Meshes of the Afternoon (1943)  
8. Ladri di biciclette (1948)   
9. Chichi ariki (1942)     
10. The Maltese Falcon (1941)   




 You are thinking about Crash (1996) by David Cronenberg. 









 L'eclisse (1962), I always end up thinking about it almost all the time. 




 Didn't the actual reviews tell you why? 




 Le samoura (1967). 




 It's very loosely based on both the novel Piknik na obochine by the Strugatsky brothers and the movie by Tarkovsky. 




 Andrei Tarkovsky. 




 For example, pretty much any feature film by Andrei Tarkovsky. Andrey Rublyov (1966) or Stalker (1979) are great examples. 




 I'll give you my favourites:     


* Banshun (1949)     
* Un condamn  mort s'est chapp ou Le vent souffle o il veut (1956)       
* Smultronstllet (1957)     
* Jalsaghar (1958)     
* Hiroshima mon amour (1959)    
* Pickpocket (1959)   
* Le trou (1960)    
* La notte (1961)     
* L'eclisse (1962)    
* Nattvardsgsterna (1962)       
* Sanma no aji (1962)         
* Tystnaden (1963)      
* Suna no onna (1964)     
* Andrey Rublyov (1966)     
* Tanin no kao (1966)      
* C'era una volta il West (1968)    
* Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969)      
* Spalovac mrtvol (1969)      
* Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972)      
* Solyaris (1972)     
* Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)  
* Zerkalo (1975)      
* Stalker (1979)       
* Krhozat (1988)        
* Der siebente Kontinent (1989)    
* Stntang (1994)      




 Probably the best scene in the movie, I love it when Isabelle Adjani is freaking out. Good stuff. 









 A lot of silent movies don't have any music tracks or sound at all. To answer your question, a big percentage of avant-garde/experimental films includes no actors/voice actors, just to take an easy example. I understand if it's effective for most of the movies you see, I was just curious what you do when a movie doesn't at all have any of the components you rate. 




 Maybe you should try Winter's Bone (2010) and Mud (2012), they are a bit similar to Blue Ruin (2013). 




 Smultronstllet (1957) is a great start. One of my favourites by him. Easily the best Swedish director ever. And one of the best overall too. 




 If they are available, I always use subtitles when watching a movie in a language I don't understand. But then again, I even used subtitles for movies in languages I already know. It seems to me that you haven't seen that many foreign films and aren't that used to subtitles? I don't see the whole thing as a problem, rather something necessary instead. I think it simply will improve with time, it's something you have to get used to. 
























 I thought it was a bit bland, uninspiring and mediocre. The slapstick and whole tone of the movie is just missing charm, it's just nothing special. I've seen much, much better from Woody Allen. 




 * Superhero movies from Hollywood        
* The amount of remakes, sequels and reboots from Hollywood       
* Ugly orange and teal color filters     




 If I had to pick out 20 of the greatest ones, I would pick these:       

* Bronenosets Potemkin (1925)     
* City Girl (1930)     
* Coeur fidle (1923)     
* Der letzte Mann (1924)      
* Flesh and the Devil (1926)          
* Frau im Mond (1929)        
* Hxan (1922)      
* Krkarlen (1921)    
* L'argent (1928)        
* La chute de la maison Usher (1928)     
* La passion de Jeanne d'Arc (1928)            
* Mnilmontant (1926)       
* Metropolis (1927)     
* Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans (1927)        
* Tagebuch einer Verlorenen (1929)       
* The Crowd (1928)        
* The Last Command (1928)      
* Tretya meshchanskaya (1927)        
* Umirayushchii lebed (1917)     
* Un chien andalou (1929)      









 Bananas (1971). 




 Pretty much every movie. At least 95 percent, maybe even more. 




  It's not easy to put these into genres.       

That doesn't mean that one should just put movies where they don't really belong.       


 I put this under Samurai because it needed to go on the list and I meant period drama. However, I have heard people using the term "Samurai Cinema" as a synonym to period drama.        

Period dramas are called jidaigeki. Samurai movies or "sword fighting" movies are called chanbara, which is a subgenre of jidaigeki. 




 The last one under "Yakuza", the film by Imamura isn't a film about yakuza, it's about a serial killer that wasn't at all affiliated with the yakuza. And putting Batoru rowaiaru (2000) under "Yakuza" films too? That doesn't make sense. Also, neither Narayama bushik (1958) or Narayama bushik (1983) (depending on which film you mean) have anything to do with samurais. Just these things makes me wonder if the person who did the list actually watched the films. 




 Imagine Lorre trying to whistle, but just failing, poor guy! Then sweet Lang comes to the rescue. How isn't that cute? 




 That's quite cute. 




 Nattvardsgsterna (1962) (Sweden). 









 Favourite science fiction movie:        


* Tanin no kao (1966)       



Favourite horror movie:         


* Spalovac mrtvol (1969)       




 The original, no doubt about it. The remake is horrible and just made everything worse. 




 Yes. Le rvlateur (1968) for example, great movie. 




 I'm glad to hear that! That's some amazing movies!    

 But you must be crazy if you think that a person who had such an acute negative reaction to Scorpio Rising would enjoy these two - similarly subversive, daring and at times campish - films. No way in hell.              



Oh, I didn't think that at all. I took those two (or three) as examples of some of my favourites just to put it in context with what is unknown and not for that specific user, because I was wondering about that part. But anyways, the user was just asking about what I considered as absolutely great of the ones that are more unknown, so it wasn't specifically something that had to be according to the user's taste, just mine. I think our tastes already differ a bit from the beginning, I for example really like Dead Man (1995). When it comes to Scorpio Rising (1964), it's quite different than the movies I took as examples though, I wouldn't call the ones I mentioned campy either. 




 Well, thanks! Or something, heh. I think I started going through the list a couple of years ago, maybe 4, not more than 5 at least. I did not stricly go by it though, I watched a lot of other stuff in between.       


 I'd love to talk to you more about the whole thing.       


Feel free to ask anything if you have more questions, I'd be happy answer them as good as I can.    


Hidden gems, you say? Well, it depends what you mean with great but otherwise quite unknown. The ones I like the most in the list aren't really that unknown. But it's hard to just put some titles out if I don't know what you consider unknown. A certain amount of ratings on IMDb? Checks on ICheckMovies? Or anything else? For example, Jalsaghar (1958) by Satyajit Ray and Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975) by Chantal Akerman aren't really unknown if you are cinephile, but a general user that hangs out on r/movies may have never heard about them. Those two are some of my favourite movies on the list, same with Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972) by Rainer Werner Fassbinder. But as I said, I wouldn't consider them unknown, so it's hard to pinpoint out any specific movies if I don't exactly known what your criteria would be. 




 Les rendez-vous d'Anna (1978). A great, minimalistic, determined and uncompromising movie about a detached and disconnected female director. Amazing character portrait, interesting and insightful conversations and a hypnotic pace. 




 I felt that it was qutie bad in the start, but got better as it went on. The plot felt thin overall, the same thing with the characters. I appretiate what Gosling is trying to do here, but many things felt forced and that he was trying to be poetic, shocking and cool, but failed. Almost like he wanted to do a mix of Lynch, Argento, Korine and Refn, but with mostly style over substance. It didn't have anything really special making it quite good. On the other hand, it's better than a lot of stuff coming nowadays from Hollywood at least. 




 I have only 5 films left on that list, so I'm guess I'm still going. I have waited with some of those I have left for different reasons. But the so called "ride" was fun and interesting so far. And of course, some movies weren't at all great, but many were. I see it as a list of movies that are good to know about when you are talking about cinema in general. The list also changes through the years. It's also many different films, so you probably get a lot out of your comfort zone, which is good if you are studying films a bit more than usual. One good thing is that you get a lot of reference to work with, which is useful in many ways. I think it's good to mix your watchlist too, to not feel obliged just to go after this particular list. Remember to watch what you want to watch. On another note, TSPDT has a list that's a bit more interesting and diverse if you want to dive into similar missions. Although, both focus pretty much on American cinema and Europe, so much stuff is left out, same with experimental films for example.        
      

I'm a person who likes lists, so these things are often enjoyable for me, but I of course always have other movies to watch at the same time. As someone else said, think of it as a guide, it's great for beginners, because you get a glimpse of the history of cinema in a way, and you'll probably learn about and discover different directors etc. You don't have to like every single movie, it's great to be critical and know what you like and not like. Be prepared to be seeing movies that you maybe won't like, don't forget that. What I'm saying is that it's a great list to start with as a guide if you are just getting interested in movies.

 That movie is so good. That's how you do a coming of age film! I love the crazy color filters. And as you said, the soundtrack is top notch! 




 Andrei Tarkovsky. 




 I watch movies because it is interesting. 




 Der siebente Kontinent (1989), the best one. 




 Not a great one, but The House of the Devil (2009) has it. 




 Le trou (1960) is great and suspenseful. 




 Some of them are really innovative, brave, special and have much interesting political content. Just take Nema-ye Nazdik (1990) by Abbas Kiarostami for example. It's about a man pretending to be the famous Iranian director Mohsen Makhmalbaf, he convinces a family that he's making a movie and promises them a part in it. The interesting part is that the actual people involved in the incident re-enact the actual events. It also features footage from the real trial that took place. The mix between fiction and documentary is great, just like the erasing of borders with what is real and what is staged. The meta aspects give it great depth too. Kiarostami is one of the most interesting directors working today.          

Other Iranian films that are good and important to check out as well:      


* Ayneh (1997)    
* Jodaeiye Nader az Simin (2011)     
* Nun va Goldoon (1996)       
* Ta'm e guilass (1997)     




 It depends what you mean with old too. But Hiroshima mon amour (1959) and Suna no onna (1964) are great and not corny or outdated at all. 




 And again, who could have posted this Teshigahara movie other than you? It's welcomed as always, you usually put up interesting and good films here. This isn't really one of his best ones, but it isn't at all that bad. It would look even better with a Blu-ray treatment! I have the book it's based on which I should start reading soon too. 




 The Tatar invasions in Andrey Rublyoy (1966). Brutal and well done, there's so much happening at the same time. Total chaos and war. Especially the way Tarkovsky cut and used tracking shots in this sequence is amazing. 




 Not really. The whole character felt forced, too obvious and over the top. Almost like a movie for children. But then again, even if I cared for him, the film had way bigger problems. And I should add that for me, it really doesn't matter if I can sympathize with the characters, it doesn't directly make a movie better or worse, which some other people think. Some examples of the pathetic dialogue:    

* *"Chappie if you want to be in the gang you have to be cool, like daddy! Look how daddy walks! Look how cool it's! Need to keep it gangsta' Chappie!"*      

* *"It's time to pump up the jam!"*      

Or just about anything coming from Die Antwoord. 




 Der siebente Kontinent (1989). 









  Will 2015 go down as one of the great years in movies?    

I really doubt that. Why would it? The year isn't even over yet. I don't think we'll see the amount of masterpieces this year that will make 2015 something special worth remembering as a mark in the history of cinema. I feel that a huge miracle would have to happen if 2015 could offer something that could even be near to compete with some great years in the past. I would say that the great years are long gone and that it's been like that for a long time. Of course, some good movies come out now and then, but to put this year so high up already? That seems like a stretch.     



 Already we've got one of the best Action, sci-fi, and Horror movies in decades.           


Well, that's your opinion. But I think you should think about it and give it a couple of years, then go back and see if you still feel the same. It seems that the general public on Reddit always have a thing to hype every year this way. All of this really makes me wonder how many movies people have seen. 




 Kenj zankoku monogatari (1964) by Takumi Furukawa. 




 I thought it was horrible. For a narrative film of this kind, the story was too simple sided and in the end, you don't really care about anything at all. The whole movie felt something like a promotional commercial for Die Antwoord, which was silly. And quite everything actually felt silly, stupid, hollow and over the top in a bad way. From the pathetic dialogue to the action and to how it was shot. It's hard to take it seriously, because it doesn't work as a comedy or any kind of critique of something either. It makes me wonder if Blomkamp offered someone from junior high to write him the dialogue. 









 1. Rocco e i suoi fratelli (1960)       
2. The Hustler (1961)      
3. Raging Bull (1980)    
4. The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner (1962)    
5. Fat City (1972)        









 Woody Allen. 




 Le samoura (1967) of course. 









 If you want good movies about geishas, I would suggest to skip Memoirs of a Geisha (2005) that some people already told you about. Instead, I recommend these:   

* Gion bayashi (1953)   
* Gion no shimai (1936)   
* Kimi to wakarete (1933)    
* Saikaku ichidai onna (1952)    
* Uwasa no onna (1954)    

Especially Mizoguchi's movies about geishas were great, they have a very feminist touch, and it's also interesting because his sister was a geisha too. Great director, particularly Gion bayashi (1953) and Saikaku ichidai onna (1952) are some of his best ones. 









 I didn't like it at all. It felt quite superficial with silly and nonsensical action scenes that were supposed to be "cool", but rather felt tiresome and perfunctory. I really disliked the visual style too. And original? I would say the opposite. The movie didn't do anything original, nuanced, experimental or interesting at all with the time travel concept. Many things just seemed rehashed from before. There's other movies that actually have something intriguing to say about time travel, this was mostly just a cheap Hollywood take on it with a big slab of shallow action to disguise everything and please the general Tom Cruise fan. But this is just what I thought and I'm probably stepping on some toes, especially here on Reddit where people seem to praise this film and have very low standards overall. 




 I haven't seen the movie, but I don't know why you would be alone when it comes to this, especially why you would ask it too. But to answer your question, you are not alone, I know that for sure. 




 I really love Der siebente Kontinent (1989), a real punch in the gut. 




 You should watch L'anne dernire  Marienbad (1961), Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969) and Zerkalo (1975). 




 Stntang (1994). 




 None. 




 * La notte (1961)      
* La peau douce (1964)  
* Le mpris (1963)             
* Nostalghia (1983)     
* Providence (1977)   
* Satansbraten (1976)    




 * A Zed   Two Noughts (1985)    
* Il sorpasso (1962)      
* Stntang (1994)     




 Hiroshima mon amour (1959), Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975), Suna no onna (1964) and many more. 



















 Stalker (1979). 









  Has anyone been able to watch all of tinker-tailor-soldier-spy without falling asleep OR using ritalin?        


Yes. 




 They already did. And they already are. A movie came out last year and a new TV series about them is coming this fall. 




 Nope. At least not yet. On the other hand, I doubt that there would be any movie scene that could change that. 














 Stalker (1979)! 




 Because many people have low standards. 




 Daniel Day-Lewis seems to be high up, especially if you look at his latest roles. 









 * Tanin no kao (1966)      
* Solyaris (1972)      
* Stalker (1979)      
* 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)      
* Pisma myortvogo cheloveka (1986)      
* Welt am Draht (1973)       
* La jete (1962)      
* Metropolis (1927)      
* Posetitel muzeya (1989)      
* Frau im Mond (1929)      



















 The Limits of Control (2009). 




 Read, get to know your film history, talk with people, hang out on different forums and sites, check out different film lists etc. 




 Yeah, I have that for some. 




 I don't know if it maybe has to do with rights. But I agree about Iran. And it would be lovely to see more from Taiwan. Also, African countries overall would be great to see more from too. In fact, it would be interesting to have almost anything older in the arthouse vein from countries like Turkey, Egypt, Romania, Greece, the Philippines, Brazil etc. 




 1. Andrey Rublyov (1966)    
2. L'eclisse (1962)    
3. Tanin no kao (1966)       
4. Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)     
5. Suna no onna (1964)       




 It wouldn't kill you to load the whole album, because the names and more info show up then. 









 La jete (1962). 




  The White Ribbon (2009)  144 Minutes      
Mulholland Drive (2001)  147 Minutes       
Blue Velvet (1986)  120 Minutes      
Lost Highway (1997)  134 Minutes        
2001: A Space Oddysey (1968)  160 Minutes       
Dead Man (1995)  121 Minutes         

Do not miss out on those! 




 On the contrary! Mr Bongo released it on DVD a while back, it's available from their website and also on Amazon. There's also one Japanese and one Polish Blu-ray release out. 




 Rekopis znaleziony w Saragossie (1965) is great when it comes to the older ones. It has a really cool frame story and it's a hell of an adventure. 




 There's not really an overload of Polish titles in the collection. But be sure to get Nz w wodzie (1962) by Roman Polanski. You also have Trois couleurs: Blanc (1994) and La double vie de Vronique (1991) by Krzysztof Kieslowski that are partly Polish. 




 * A Woman Under the Influence (1974)     
* Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)  
* Mamma Roma (1962)      
* Mat i syn (1997)       
* Rakuyju (1986)     




 Andrey Rublyov (1966). 




 Huh? 




 Smultronstllet (1957), Andrey Rublyov (1966) and C'era una volta il West (1968) are highly rewatchable. 




 Kakushi-toride no san-akunin (1958) and Divorzio all'italian (1961) that you are namedropping are for example available on Hulu. Netflix seems to be overall quite bad if you are looking after movies outside Hollywood or the mainstream and even older movies. To take an example, the Swedish version is a joke if you are looking for movies before 1960. There's other streaming services though, like Hulu, Fandor and Mubi that are much better if you are in search for older flicks. Also, buying physical copies is a great way to do it too. 




 It seems that Kynodontas (2009) could be up your alley. Maybe even Stalker (1979), which is a masterpiece. 




 10 good movies at least. Nice to see Ozu in the top! He truly was a master. 




 Some are from the DVD/Blu-ray releases, others are screen captured by me and some are from various sites on the Internet. 




 Better late than never. I actually rewatched Clo de 5  7 (1962) some days ago. Charming little film. 




 A selection:     

* Hiroshima mon amour (1959)      
* L'eclisse (1962)      
* Nattvardsgsterna (1963)       
* Suna no onna (1964)           
* Andrey Rublyov (1966)     
* Tanin no kao (1966)      
* Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969)     
* Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)    
* Der siebente Kontinent (1989)      
* Stntang (1994)      




 Just by seeing the title, I knew it was you who uploaded the album! A good Imamura film, always nice to see your uploads. 









 I also almost forgot about Nema-ye Nazdik (1990), it really deserves to be mentioned in this case. It's quite special, because it's a mix of both fiction film and documentary. It's about a man pretending to be the Iranian director Mohsen Makhmalbaf who takes advantage of a family while promising them to be involved in his next film. It's actually based on real events and the roles of the real people who were involved in the story are played by themselves. Great movie! 




 I thought This Is the End (2013) was quite bad, but you have Le mpris (1963) where Fritz Lang plays himself and Sunset Blvd. (1950) where Cecil B. DeMille, Hedda Hopper, Buster Keaton and some other actors are playing themselves, that's at least two good movies. 









 Sure, I can recommend checking out these:     

* Matka Joanna od aniolw (1961) (Jerzy Kawalerowicz)    
* Sanatorium pod klepsydra (1973) (Wojciech Has)     
* Struktura krysztalu (1969) (Krzysztof Zanussi)        




 No, none. I hope they will do it in the future. Other companies have released some of their stuff though, I know that there's at least two movies from Has that's been released in Poland on Blu-ray, but several other movies from those three directors deserve the Blu-ray treatment too, especially a bit more universal versions. 




 And that's almost nothing compared to Polish directors like Wojciech Has, Jerzy Kawalerowicz and Krzysztof Zanussi, they get shimmied to the side even more! 




 It's absolutely no requirement to enjoying and/or understanding the movie, but it's of course easier to understand everything if you know more, it says itself. 




 To make it short, it's one of the best and most important Polish films ever made, particularly about Poland's war and post-war history, just that makes it worth watching. If you have any interest in cinema at all, it's a mandatory watch. The movie is a powerful depiction of war and how it can affect a person's choices. The cinematography is also beautiful and especially Zbigniew Cybulski is great in his role. [Here](http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/826-ashes-and-diamonds)	and [here](http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/363-ashes-and-diamonds)	are two interesting smaller essays about it at Criterion's website which gives some more insight. 









 I haven given 26 movies the score 5/5. 




 Many people seem to use that as an argument. Sadly. 














 Hopefully one or all of these:      

* Himiko (1974)     
* Les rendez-vous d'Anna (1978)      
* Midareru (1964)  
* Nayak (1966)        
* Nobi (1959)     




 Smultronstllet (1957). 




 Woody Allen. 




 I'm voting for Woody Allen. 




 He's a superhero. Why even question things like these in a Marvel movie? It just seems pointless. 




 I haven't seen Furious Seven (2015), Iron Man 3 (2013), Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011), Transformers: Age of Extinction (2014), Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (2006), and Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides (2011), but I can't say that I really care about the rest or that they're good movies. The taste of the general public is usually quite bad, these things pretty much confirm it for me. A movie that's making a lot of money isn't automatically good. 




 Tonari no Totoro (1988). 




 Have you read reviews for the movie? It seems that they would give you the answer. 




 Michael Haneke. 




 Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972) and La maman et la putain (1973) are two of the best ones. 




 Showgirls (1995). 




 It's not one of the best films from the wave, but asolutely worth watching. I gave it 3/5. I think it's one of the earliest examples from the Czechoslovak New Wave too. 





























 Thumbs up for this. One of the best directors in the history of cinema. It's sad that he died so early. All hail Fassbinder! 




 Ten of my favourite screenplays:        

* Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972)      
* Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969)      
* Hiroshima mon amour (1959)       
* L'eclisse (1962)      
* La notte (1961)    
* Pickpocket (1959)       
* Sanma no aji (1962)      
* Smultronstllet (1957)      
* Suna no onna (1964)       
* Tanin no kao (1966)        




 Spalovac mrtvol (1969). 




 Manhattan (1979). 














 I haven't seen Fury (2014), so my list isn't necessarily a list of movies that are similar to it, but they are ten of my favourites when it comes to war movies:   

* Apocalypse Now (1979)      
* Csillagosok, katonk (1967)    
* Idi i smotri (1985)     
* Ivanovo detstvo (1962)        
* L'arme des ombres (1969)      
* Lacombe Lucien (1974)     
* Nobi (1959)      
* Popil i diament (1958)      
* Paths of Glory (1957)      
* Voskhozhdenie (1977)       




 [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwb3P0fuM1c) scene from C'era una volta il West (1968), the final duel. Pure magic. If you haven't seen the movie at all, I would advice you to not watch the clip if you are sensitive when it comes to spoilers. 



















 I really like the ending to L'eclisse (1962). The whole movie is of course a masterpiece, but since we're talking about endings, I have to mention it. It would almost be a bit pointless to post a clip, because you really have to see the whole film until the very end to be able to put the ending in context. Also, the final shots are just breathtaking and amazingly framed. It's one of those endings that really stuck with me, it's very special. 




 I haven't seen it yet, but it sounds absurd to me that it would be better than Stalker (1979). 









 I don't know if you are kidding or not, but I hope we don't get anymore of them. 














 1962 was an amazing year. We got L'eclisse (1962), Sanma no aji (1962), Procs de Jeanne d'Arc (1962), La jete (1962), Le doulos (1962), Tsubaki Sanjr (1962), Mamma Roma (1962), Il sorpasso (1962), El ngel exterminador (1962), Lolita (1962), Seppuku (1962), Ivanovo detstvo (1962), Vivre sa vie: Film en douze tableaux (1962) etc.        


1964 and 1969, thats two other years that were great too. Just overall, I find it hard to see how anything could beat the sixties. It was in the sixties that some of the best and most interesting waves came and/or had their peak, for example the Japanese new wave and the French new wave. It was also at that time some of the best, most interesting, most creative, and most influental directors ever were working, we had Robert Bresson, Stanley Kubrick, Andrei Tarkovsky, Hiroshi Teshigahara, Jean-Luc Godard, Michelangelo Antonioni, Ingmar Bergman, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Jean-Pierre Melville, Akira Kurosawa, Yoshishige Yoshida, Louis Malle, Kaneto Shind, Alain Resnais, Shhei Imamura, Masahiro Shinoda, and many, many others. Just take Japanese cinema as an example, that period was crazy and filled with good cinema. Aside from film, it happened quite much in the sixties from a political view all over the world, so I guess that had to do a lot with what movies we got too. 









 The framing is amazing! You really sit and get amazed by every single shot. I love the angles and the compositions. The lightning is great too, everything is just so goddamn precise. 




 If it has to be people that are alive, I would want to see a movie with Lszl Krasznahorkai as a writer and Michael Haneke as a director. 




 Gamlet (1964) by Grigori Kozintsev. 




 * Al-mummia (1969)       
* Gu ling jie shao nian sha ren shi jian (1991)        
* Khesht va Ayeneh (1965)        




 A lot. Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975), L'eclises (1962), Zerkalo (1975), Sanma no aji (1962), and many, many more. The thing is, I no longer really care that much about trailers in general. If something sounds interesting for specific reasons, I usually end up watching it without looking at a trailer, especially when it comes to older movies, there's a lot of them that don't even seem to have trailers uploaded on the Internet etc. And often I don't feel the actual need to look at a trailer, it's enough knowing what a movie is about and who the director is for me. 




 Some examples would include Masahiro Yamada, Andrei Tarkovsky, Satyajit Ray, Tonino Guerra, and Robert Bresson. 




 Welt am Draht (1973) by Rainer Werner Fassbinder is great. I would rank it quite high when it comes to science fiction movies in general, it's actually that great. 




 Nattvardsgsterna (1962), Smultronstllet (1957) and Tystnaden (1963). 




 I haven't seen Tropic Thunder (2008), but if I made a top 1000 list, I wouldn't have the other two on it. So to answer your question, I've seen much, much better. 




 I believe the user meant The Divide (2011) by Xavier Gens. The TV-series is about a district attorney, not any kind of apocalypse. 




 Pisma myortvogo cheloveka (1986) by Konstantin Lopushanskiy. It has been described as one of the most depressing films ever made. The thing is, it doesn't need to have graphic depictions of rape, murder, cannibalism etc. I think that's mostly an easy target to the audience, and Hollywood likes to use similar dramatic situations to show us how bad things are, and they often tell us that in a very superficial, manipulating and dramatic way, to cause certain easy effects. But Pisma myortvogo cheloveka (1986) doesn't use cheap ways to show the apocalypse, that's what I like about it. It has a pitch-black atmosphere that can't be found in movies like The Road (2009). It doesn't have any melodramatic piano music or something similar like in The Road (2009). It's just dark, depressing and actually has something interesting to say. 




 I like it, but I wouldn't rank it that high when it comes to his movies. I feel that it doesn't have anything against Manhattan (1979) for example. 




 To go after what the majority of people here think is unknown isn't a good parameter at all. It especially shows when movies like Moon (2009) and In Bruges (2008) are on the list. So to answer your question, none of those movies are really "largely unknown". And if someone wants to get a laugh, check out the Reddit thread that is linked in the article. 




 I'm just about to start this evening rewatching La notte (1961). 




 Jeanne Moreau has worked with Michelangelo Antonioni, Luis Buuel, Louis Malle, Theo Angelopoulos, Jacques Becker, Orson Welles, Marguerite Duras, Tsai Ming-liang, Franois Truffaut, Rainer Werner Fassbinder and Wim Wenders. Not easy to beat. 









 Is he? He's for example not ranked on the list of directors at TSPDT and I've probably never seen him mentioned as a director on any other more serious list. He doesn't seem to be that widely mentioned and that highly regarded in film literature in general either. I wouldn't rank him so high after seeing his three animated feature films, he's mostly a mediocre Hollywood director in my eyes. And I doubt that Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol (2011) and Tomorrowland: A World Beyond (2015) would change my view of him. I think he's mostly highly regarded by every Tom, Dick and Harry, the general IMDb users, people on Reddit, the mainstream critics over at RT and judges who give out the more commercial awards, just to take some examples. 














 I prefer the original. The remake is horrible in comparison. Everything is better in the original. Everything from the soundtrack to the cinematography and especially how the story is told. 




 * Mulholland Dr. (2001)  
* Persona (1966)                
* Werckmeister harmnik (2000)             














 It's not been released on any form of home media, so no streaming or DVD/Blu-ray available yet. The movie has mostly been screened at various festivals so far. If you want to watch it as soon as possible, you will have to do it in a movie theater. Look at IMDb for release dates in various countries. 




 Nightcrawler (2014). 




 Jean-Pierre Laud in Les quatre cents coups (1959). 




 C'era una volta il west (1968) by Sergio Leone, no doubt about it. It's just perfect. 




 Damn! My fault!      
The other two aren't as amazing as Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969), but still great and absolutely worth watching. 




 Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972) by Rainer Werner Fassbinder, it's the best. Takes place in the protagonist's house and the cast is all female. A masterpiece.

 No, I don't. 




 Great! One of the best horror movies of all time. Amazing atmosphere and a good soundtrack too.

 La plante sauvage (1973).

 Le beau Serge (1958). 




 I actually did a blind buy of the Blu-ray myself. It's a great and beautiful movie with lovely performances. I really recommend it. It sticks with you. 














 Here's ten movies that could be something for you:      

* A Zed   Two Noughts (1985)      
* Andrey Rublyov (1966)    
* Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969)        
* Gion bayashi (1953)    
* Hiroshima mon amour (1959)   
* Jalsaghar (1958)      
* L'eclisse (1962)     
* Pickpocket (1959)     
* Spalovac mrtvol (1969)     
* Tanin no kao (1966)    

Since you know about Godard, Fellini and Bergman already, we can skip those aside a bit when it comes to recommendations. These ten movies will introduce you to some interesting and important directors, also some of my absolute favourites. All of them are visually interesting and philosophical, but mainly some of the best movies ever made, from Czechoslovakia, Italy, Japan, Soviet Union, India, United Kingdom and France, which is quite a little mix I fixed for you. If you like some stuff by Godard, Fellini and Bergman, there's a big chance that these movies will be in your taste too. 














 There's quite much I still haven't seen yet, but I'll take the three best movies that I gave 3/5 (the highest score so far) to from last year:      

1. Xi you (2014)     
2. Turist (2014)    
3. Mr. Turner (2014)      

For the record, I've only seen 37 films from 2014 too. 




 I really don't get surprised anymore, there's always going to be people who haven't seen popular and well known movies like The Godfather (1972), Star Wars (1977), Titanic (1997), The Shawshank Redemption (1994), Pulp Fiction (1994), Forrest Gump (1994) etc. I only get surprised if it's someone I already know when it comes to certain movies or any similar matter. When I just started watching more and more movies, there were many classics that I missed, so I don't get that surprised if people who aren't into movies that much haven't seen certain films. 




 Well, many are good and Hollywood are seeing potential in them, of course they want to use them if they are popular and can make some money. There's many kind of roles for these kind of actors. But as someone already said, "foreign" actors have always been around in American cinema. The movie industry is getting bigger and bigger, so it's easier to spot everything and everyone now. 




 * Solyaris (1972) (Eduard Artemyev): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uM7722EAz0      
* Stalker (1979) (Eduard Artemyev): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP1QXKbhqr4      
* Tanin no kao (1966) (Tru Takemitsu): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_mcyKFOEpg                
   




 I can't say I liked it that much. The director isn't doing anything interesting with the nonlinear storyline, the use of music tried to be quirky and indie (The Smiths etc.), but felt mostly forced, cheap and so obvious. When using this kind of music in a movie, it doesn't have to be subtle, but it's no juxtaposition of interest or anything done with finesse. There's not really any good drama and the comedy parts are totally missing charm. The voiceover is quite bad, silly and doesn't do or add anything either, it's just in the way overexplaining things. I also disliked how it was shot with its distastefully "in your face" form. On the other hand, it's a bit better than the majority of similar modern romantic comedies from Hollywood, but that doesn't make it good. I've seen far suckier movies of course, but this one is easy to forget and nothing I would rank high at all. 




 It really depends on what you are looking after. The books are quite different from each other and cover different periods, genres and topics. But one favourite is Eros Plus Massacre: An Introduction to the Japanese New Wave Cinema, I'm a big fan of the Japanese New Wave and some of the directors that emerged from it, so I'm happy that there's a whole book covering it. As a more general book, I like A Critical Handbook of Japanese Film Directors because of its big, diverse and wide coverage of directors.     

I'd also love to find a book on Setsuko Hara, she's wonderful! I don't think there's any book about her in English yet, am I right? 




 Here are some useful and interesting books that can be of your interest:    

* A Hundred Years of Japanese Film        
* TokyoScope: The Japanese Cult Film Companion      
* The Japanese Film: Art and Industry (Expanded Edition)      
* Behind the Pink Curtain: The Complete History of Japanese Sex Cinema      
* The Yakuza Movie Book: A Guide to Japanese Gangster Films      
* The Japanese Filmography       
* A Critical Handbook of Japanese Film Directors         
* A New History of Japanese Cinema: A Century of Narrative Film    
* Reframing Japanese Cinema: Authorship, Genre, History       
* Eros Plus Massacre: An Introduction to the Japanese New Wave Cinema     
* Outlaw Masters of Japanese Film     
* Recalling the Treasures of Japanese Cinema       
* Classical Japanese Cinema Revisited       
* Nippon Modern: Japanese Cinema of the 1920s and 1930s   
* Cinema of Actuality: Japanese Avant-Garde Filmmaking in the Season of Image Politics      
* No Borders, No Limits: Nikkatsu Action Cinema         

Some of them are more specific (like the one about the Japanese New Wave) and some of them are more general (A Critical Handbook of Japanese Film Directors for example, which I really recommend), I think you'll notice. I actually just received copies of No Borders, No Limits: Nikkatsu Action Cinema and The Midnight Eye Guide to New Japanese Film some days ago, the later one covers mostly newer movies, but it has some pages that cover directors like Seijun Suzuki, Shhei Imamura and others that were active before 1970. Also, there's a lot of books covering certain directors, but I'm guessing that you already know that and that you're more interesting in something of a more general coverage. But this list will be a good guide for starters. 
























 Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969) by Yoshishige Yoshida. A very rich, interesting, beautiful and complex portrayal of history, sex and politics. Truly a masterpiece. 









 As someone already kind of mentioned, Ozu was the master when it came to movies about everyday life with great dialogue. Check out the movie already mentioned, these are also worth checking out too:      

* Akibiyori (1960)       
* Banshun (1949)     
* Tky boshoku (1957)       

The movies by Jean-Pierre   Luc Dardenne could be something for you too, they work with quite much realism, some examples:       

* Le fils (2002)    
* Le gamin au vlo (2011)     
* Rosetta (1999)       

Also, most stuff by Eric Rohmer would fit the bill. They are very heavy on dialogue which is often very good written, check out these:      

* Conte d'automne (1998)      
* L'amour l'aprs-midi (1972)      
* Ma nuit chez Maud (1969)      

And at last, three other movies by different directors I can recommend too:      

* Aruitemo aruitemo (2008)     
* I fidanzati (1963)         
* Struktura krysztalu (1969)      




 Pretty much anything from Tarkovsky and Tarr. Movies like Andrey Rublyov (1966), Stalker (1979), Solyaris (1972), Stntang (1994), Krhozat (1988), and Werckmeister harmnik (2000) are full of amazing and long takes. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykpJkf76X04) is a great example from Werckmeister harmnik (2000). 




 Another gem from Yoshida, great stuff. 









 Hollywood is actually a disgusting business full of sexism and racism, this is a good example. It's just sad that not many people are aware of it. 




 *"The first trailer shown in a U.S. film theater was in November 1913, when Nils Granlund, the advertising manager for the Marcus Loew theater chain, produced a short promotional film for the musical The Pleasure Seekers, opening at the Winter Garden Theatre on Broadway. Loew adopted the practice, which was reported in a wire service story carried by the Lincoln, Nebraska Daily Star, describing it as "an entirely new and unique stunt", and that "moving pictures of the rehearsals and other incidents connected with the production will be sent out in advance of the show, to be presented to the Loews picture houses and will take the place of much of the bill board advertising". Granlund was also first to introduce trailer material for an upcoming motion picture, using a slide technique to promote an upcoming film featuring Charlie Chaplin at Loew's Seventh Avenue Theatre in Harlem in 1914."*         

/[Wikipedia](http://tinyurl.com/6rjbmdu)	 




 * Annie Hall (1977)      
* Bringing up Baby (1938)       
* His Girl Friday (1940)        
* Holiday (1938)         
* Manhattan (1979)

 I just throw them in the trashcan. 




 The final duel scene from C'era una volta il West (1968):    
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwb3P0fuM1c 




 You don't have to watch the first one to get the second one. On another note, I wouldn't recommend the movie at all. It's just dumb, disgusting and silly trash in the worst ways possible. There's tons of other movies that are ten times better to watch. 




 L'eclisse (1962), I stumbled upon it years ago on a film site. It was amazing and today it's one of my absolute favourites. It also pretty much helped to start my interest in cinema. 




 Possession (1981). 




 I think it was La passion de Jeanne d'Arc (1928), a great one. 




 You should watch Tanin no kao (1966), it's the best. 




 Masahiko Shimazu, Benkei Shiganoya, John Cazale, Hohi Aoki, Jean Keraudy, El Hedi ben Salem, and Karuna Bannerjee. 




 Of course. Collecting is fun, I also like physical copies. And some have interesting extra features. 









 Tanin no kao (1966). 




 There's some interesting coverage on these sites right now:

 I know I've seen many people that believed True Romance (1993) was directed by Quentin Tarantino, but he was the one who wrote the script and Tony Scott directed it. 




 The Godfather (1972), Taxi Driver (1976) and A Clockwork Orange (1971) seem to have that rating if you want movies from the top 100 over at IMDb. If you haven't seen them, I would say that all three of them should be seen if you have the slightest interest in cinema. Maybe a little obvious, but it's hard for me to figure out what you've seen when you're talking about the ratings. Considering what other movies you like, I think they could be something in your taste. 









 I was quite curious how the movie probably butchered everything that had to do with BDSM. And I wasn't really surprised that it would be bad, I expected it. But I think it's very helpful, useful and interesting to watch many different kind of movies., which I try to do as much as I can. 




 Fifty Shades of Grey (2015) probably tops my list of the ones I've seen. 




 The goodbye between Piero (Alain Delon) and Vittoria (Monica Vitti) in L'eclisse (1962). 




 It's not allowed to advertise, promote, post or comment about illegal filesharing of movies or any other media here. 




 It's not available to stream legally yet. 




 Tanin no kao (1966), with no doubt the best one. Also, Les yeux sans visage (1960) is another one I hold quite high up on my top list. 




 La jete (1962) by Chris Marker, the movie Twelve Monkeys (1995) was inspired by. It's great, darker and much better than Twelve Monkeys (1995), Donnie Darko (2001) or any similar stuff. When it comes to time travel, don't miss out on Je t'aime je t'aime (1968) by Alain Resnais either. 




 Woody Allen. 














 This one is great! It has a fast pace and is cool as hell.      

 Ah, but have you seen Norifumi Suzuki? That's some completely bonkers cuckoo-bugfuckery right there.    

You mean movies by the director? I've seen some scenes from Fury anego den: Inoshika Och (1973), Christina Lindberg is in that one, heh. Other than that, I haven't really explored that Suzuki further. 









 There's tons of great stuff. I really don't know what you have seen, but I'll give you three great recommendations:     

* Spalovac mrtvol (1969)    
* Stalker (1979)    
* Suna no onna (1964)     




 You should try Belle de jour (1967), a great one by Luis Buuel. 




 * Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens (1922)       
* Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht (1979)       
* Only Lovers Left Alive (2013)     
* Vampyr (1932)       
























 * 30s: M (1931)       
* 40s: Banshun (1949)       
* 50s: Hiroshima mon amour (1959)       
* 60s: Andrey Rublyov (1966)      
* 70s: Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)      
* 80s: Der siebente Kontinent	 (1989)         
* 90s: Stntang (1994)     
* 00s: The Limits of Control (2009)    
* 10s: Norte, hangganan ng kasaysayan (2013)       




 You got some general and some specific recommendations already, here's some that I would add:     

* 8 (1963)      
* Accattone (1961)       
* I fidanzati (1963)     
* I pugni in tasca (1965)       
* Il deserto rosso (1964)      
* Il posto (1961)       
* Il vangelo secondo Matteo (1964)       
* L'eclisse (1962)      
* La notte (1961)       
* L'avventura (1960)     
* Mamma Roma (1962)   
* Viaggio in Italia (1954)       

Antonioni's alienation trilogy is truly amazing, I would say that especially L'eclisse (1962) is one of the best films ever made. 




 Someone else already mentioned Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969) by Yoshishige Yoshida, that's what I would say too. It's just sad how ignored Yoshida really is when it comes to cinema in general, many of his films are really amazing. I would love to see this one on Blu-ray. 




 Bringing up Baby (1938) and The Big Sleep (1946). 




 It's just pure aesthetic perfection, especially the framing is amazing. One of the best movies of all time too. It's also a tragedy that not a single Yoshida movie is out on Blu-ray, especially this one. 




 Examples of some gorgeous films:       

* 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)       
* Andrey Rublyov (1966)        
* C'era una volta il West (1968)    
* Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969)     
* L'eclisse (1962)        
* Mujo (1970)      
* Stntang (1994)        
* Stalker (1979)         
* Tobenai chinmoku (1966)     
* Zerkalo (1975)       

The bell scene in Andrey Rublyov (1966), the final duel in C'era una volta il West (1968), the hair washing scene in Zerkalo (1975) etc. There's so much stuff that's amazing. 




 You can use http://www.imdb.com/search/title to search for films with specific titles. 




 I think it's you. But to each his own. 









 I would suggest starting with Ivanovo detsvo (1962) and going on from there. It's a bit more accessible than his later works and a perfect start. Great movie too. 




 Thanks a lot for this! Now I'm waiting for The Freshman (1925), Riot in Cell Block 11 (1954) and The Complete Jacques Tati to pop up in the mail. The shipping gets quite high, especially if it's going to be delivered to Europe, but as you said, it's still a good deal. And by the way, I don't know if any of you got it too, but The Complete Jacques Tati on Blu-ray just went for CDN$ 10.39 also. 




 Great to see Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975) on the first place, that's what I would put there too. I was just waiting for it to show up when scrolling down! Some other great choices that are top favourites from 1975 for me as well. Thumbs up for choosing films by Angelopoulos and Fassbinder too. 









  I'm not sure it would count though - when the film begins, he's already tied in a mobius strip isn't he? You can hear the sirens blaring past with the "dick laurent is dead" on the intercom (I know, I'm being picky here).      

It was a long time ago when I saw it, but I checked a bit, and it starts with Fred Madison receiving that message on the intercom, but he isn't tied or anything, he's in his house. So yeah, it all depends on how you want to count it. The events sure are mysterious though. 




 You are welcome, it's a great movie! Have you seen Lost Highway (1997) by David Lynch too? If not, that would also fit the bill. Werckmeister harmnik (2000) by Bla Tarr is another recommendation. 




 How about Blue Velvet (1986)? 




 It's about eight interwoven stories, which occur in the lead-up to the 2001 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, it's just set on the other side of the Atlantic, that's where Denmark gets in the picture. 









 Stntang (1994). If you mean by year. 




 That's Hollywood in a nutshell. Money, money, money. What were you expecting? 




 Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975) by Chantal Akerman. 




 It sounds a bit like Wandfuru raifu (1998), could that be it? 




 The Act of Killing (2012). Make sure to watch the longer version. 




 * Delphine Seyrig in Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)         
* Gena Rowlands in A Woman Under the Influence (1974)      
* Margit Carstensen in Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972) 




 I waited some time with Stntang (1994) (~7 hours), Shoah (1985) (~9 hours) and Out 1, noli me tangere (1971) (~12 hours), but I finally saw them. Well worth the time, all three movies. For me it's mostly been about being in the right mood, not having the time was never really a problem. 




 Krhozat (1988). 




 It could be a progressive and very interesting thing if it's done in a great way, but I don't think we can expect somethng like that from a company like Marvel. Just look at their gender roles and how women are portrayed for example. 




 When I first heard about Jurassic World (2015), my expectations were very low. When I saw the trailer, nothing really changed, it just confirmed my feelings. I try to not have too high expectations overall when it comes to movies, but they are mostly at their lowest when we're talking about these kind of big mainstream films from Hollywood. At this point, you typically know what to expect from them. I don't associate modern day mainstream Hollywood with cinematic masterpieces exactly. 




 The Wicker Man (1973) is a must watch, not a bad one at all. 




 I have to say Stntang (1994). I really enjoyed the movie pretty much more than the book. 









 Interesting reading. And interesting to hear about the parts that Satyajit Ray helped with. I have to get my hands on this one. 




 Doesn't get better than these:      

* La jete (1962)      
* Pisma myortvogo cheloveka (1986)      
* Stalker (1979)           




 I posted this list in a similar thread in another subreddit. Here's 20 of my favourite movies that are 90 minutes or under that I would consider the best:          

* Csillagosok, katonk (1967) (90 minutes)         
* Gion bayashi (1953) (85 minutes)              
* Hiroshima mon amour (1959) (90 minutes)                
* I fidanzati (1963) (77 minutes)             
* Koridorius (1995) (85 minutes)            
* La jete (1962) (28 minutes)            
* Le rvlateur (1968) (67 minutes)                          
* Les yeux sans visage (1960) (88 minutes)                   
* Mouchette (1967) (78 minutes)              
* Nattvardsgsterna (1963) (81 minutes)         
* Nun va Goldoon (1996) (78 minutes)            
* Obrazy starho sveta (1972) (70 minutes)                             
* Okasareta hakui (1967) (56 minutes)            
* Persona (1966) (85 minutes)            
* Pickpocket (1959) (75 minutes)            
* Procs de Jeanne d'Arc (1962) (65 minutes)             
* Sayat Nova (1969) (79 minutes)             
* Shinjuku maddo (1970) (65 minutes)            
* Un homme qui dort (1974) (77 minutes)       
* Une femme est une femme (1965) (85 minutes)          




 L'eclisse (1962). No other movie does it better. 




 La jete (1962) is easily the best. 




 Rainer Werner Fassbinder in Faustrecht der Freiheit (1975) where he plays the main role. What a guy. 




 I wasn't surprised the first time I read about it either. A good one! Haneke has great taste. 














 Double Indemnity (1944). 




 Yeah, me too. But I'm glad that he at least is going to make another movie. 









 Du rififi chez les hommes (1955). 




 Kuroi ame (1989). 




 It's great. Well shot, great actors and a surreal and dark plot. One of David Lynch's best films. 




 Der siebente Kontinent (1989). 




 Here's ten great movies that I feel most people really have missed:      

* Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969)       
* Himiko (1974)  
* Le rvlateur (1968)            
* Mujo (1970)       
* Obrazy starho sveta (1972)   
* Onna no naka ni iru tanin (1966)   
* Shura (1971)          
* Tabiate bijan (1974)        
* Tobenai chinmoku (1966)       
* Tsuit no zawameki (1988)       

All of them are really good and deserve more attention. It's for example a bit sad that a great director like Yoshishige Yoshida is so unknown. It's even more heartbreaking that some of the movies I mentioned still haven't got any proper releases, I hope that will change in the future. 




 Too hard for me to make a top ten, but I know at least I would put these on my list:            

* 8 (1963)      
* Kokuhakuteki joyron (1971)        
* Le mpris (1963)      
* Nema-ye Nazdik (1990)    
* Nun va Goldoon (1996)              
* To vlemma tou Odyssea (1995)       




 A few of my favourite silents aren't on the list either, like Umirayushchii lebed (1917), Krkarlen (1921), Hxan (1922), Die Nibelungen: Siegfried (1924), Coeur fidle (1923), The Merry Widow (1925), Tretya meshchanskaya (1927), L'argent (1928), Frau im Mond (1929), City Girl (1930), Zemlya (1930), and  propos de Nice (1930). I saw other movies by Victor Sjstrm, Yevgeni Bauer, Erich von Stroheim and Jean Epstein on the list though. 




 I've seen 69 of them, a lot of shorts that I haven't taken the time to watch. Some interesting choices overall. Some of my favourite silents are present, so that was nice to see. This makes me eager to make a list of my own and also watch some of those that I haven't seen yet. 




 1. Der siebente Kontinent (1989)     
2. Andrey Rublyov (1966)     
3. L'eclisse (1962) 




 Il sorpasso (1962) and Saraba natsu no hikari (1968). 




 Krhozat (1988) by Bla Tarr. Also, do not miss out on Juhy no yoromeki (1968) by Yoshishige Yoshida that someone else already mentioned. 














 8 (1963). 




 Aruitemo aruitemo (2008). 




 Nattvardsgsterna (1963). 




 Sanma no aji (1962). 




 Andrei Tarkovsky. 




 No, how much money a movie makes has nothing to do with how good it is. 




 It always depends on what you mean with minimalism. But in general terms, nobody did minimalism like Robert Bresson, especially his later films. For example, look at Pickpocket (1959). But first, read about his rules and the way he made his films, it's very interesting and a must if you aren't familiar with his style. He stripped away every bare essential as much as he could, from the acting to the sound. I believe he was the true minimalist. 




 Tobenai chinmoku (1966) by Kazuo Kuroki. 




 Double Indemnity (1944) is really his best one in my opinion. One of the best movies when it comes to film noir and even American cinema in general. He's done some other good movies too (and some weaker ones), but I wouldn't call him that obscure as you seem to. Maybe he's not that discussed on a place like this, especially if you compare him to names like Kubrick, Hitchcock and Scorsese, but I feel that there's also some other great filmmakers that get mentioned even less (or possibly not at all). I guess it always depends on what and how you are comparing everything. 




 This month. 




 Post Tenebras Lux (2012)? 




 Tonari no Totoro (1988). It's cute, quick-witted, heartwarming, charming, has a magical atmosphere and looks stunning. It doesn't really rely heavily on conflicts either, which I think makes it even better. 




 Suna no onna (1964) and Spalovac mrtvol (1969). 




 I think it could be interesting. There's several other Mexican movies than the ones he was in I rather see getting the Criterion treatment, but on the other hand, I'd welcome some Cantinflas movies more than some other stuff. Also, more Mexican cinema in the collection would probably be a good choice. 




 Repulsion (1965). 




 La plante sauvage (1973) is probably the best one I've seen. 




 I don't have any specific parameters that I look for. But for a biopic to be really great, it has to be special. And in what way, that's something I wouldn't really know until I've seen it. For me, the form and how a biopic is done, that's for example far more important than if it covers a certain period of a subject's life or an entire existence.

My three favourite biopics that I feel are far superior than others:       

* Andrey Rublyov (1966)   
* Edvard Munch (1974)   
* Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969)   

What makes these three superior is their form and content and how they relate to each other. Tarkovsky's way of working and sculpting in time together with his philosophical and metaphysical depth, the interesting documentary approach Watkins uses, to Yoshida's interwoven and absurdly complex narrative which binds together time and subjects. 




 Director:        

* Michael Haneke      


Actors:       

* Isabelle Huppert       
* Isaach De Bankol       
* Kati Outinen      
* Taraneh Alidoosti         




 The Shining (1980) by Stanley Kubrick. 




 Woody Allen. 




 You should check out some classic film noir set in Los Angeles:       

* Double Indemnity (1944)       
* Kiss Me Deadly (1955)        
* The Big Heat (1953)      
* The Big Sleep (1945)     

L.A. Noire took quite many influences from these kind of movies, as you probably know, several titles can be found when looking for the golden film reels. I would also recommend Chinatown (1974) if you want something newer. It is set in 1937, but maybe that's good enough too. That movie is very similar to L.A. Noire. 




 Andrey Rublyov (1966). 




 Sanbiki no samurai (1964) by Hideo Gosha and Genroku Chshingura (1941) by Kenji Mizoguchi. 




 It's really enjoyable and entertaining. One of the best silent movies. If you will be bored? That's a strange question to ask, how should other people know that? On the other hand, it's a must watch if you have the slightest interest in cinema. The movie is a milestone when it comes to science fiction films, especially when it comes to the ones depicting a dystopia. Just the amazing sets makes it worth to see. It's as relevant today as it was back then, maybe even more now. 




 The Straight Story (1999). 




 Book chon bang hyang (2011). Hong Sang-soo's movies are really good. 




 Exactly! 




 Run times are quite secondary. One of the best films I have seen was over 7 hours long, another one was only 75 minutes, so it's quite irrelevant for me. The run time of a movie has nothing to do with the quality of it, there's so many other factors to the whole picture. Everything depends on how the movie is done, not how long the run time is. Shorter movies can sometimes even feel longer than the longer ones etc. Run times have never been a problem for me though. 




 I would put Amour (2012) and Ni na bian ji dian (2011) as the top ones in my list. By the way, the 2000s and the 21st century isn't the same thing, just a heads up. 









 My favourite is Sanma no aji (1962). 




 Chish Ry. 




 Conte d'automne (1998). The majority of Rohmer's films have great, realistic, smart and enjoyable dialogue. 




 Some kind of supernatural entity. Also, the director Mitchell said the following:             


*"I'm not personally that interested in where 'it' comes from. To me, it's dream logic in the sense that they're in a nightmare, and when you're in a nightmare there's no solving the nightmare. Even if you try to solve it."* 














 Three good movies about filmmakers:     
 
* 8 (1963)    
* Stardust Memories (1980)       
* To vlemma tou Odyssea (1995)       


Three good movies about painters:     

* Andrey Rublyov (1966)       
* Edvard Munch (1974)      
* La belle noiseuse (1991)      




 Gamlet (1964). 




 It does! 




 Trois couleurs: Bleu (1993) by Krzysztof Kieslowski. About a woman (played by Juliette Binoche) struggling to find a way to live her life after the death of her husband and daughter. 



















 Michael Haneke. 




 Le trou (1960). 




 That's the way life can be. 














 It's a bit hard to rank, but I would at least put these five in the top:       

* A torini l (2011)       
* Amour (2012)       
* Book chon bang hyang (2011)      
* Norte, hangganan ng kasaysayan (2013)       
* The Act of Killing (2012)       

Is it for a specific reason that your list only contains movies in the English language? Do you have another list for the rest? Or why did you put emphasis on that part? I don't get it.          




 No. He doesn't even come close to masters like Mizoguchi, Bresson, Tarkovsky, Bergman etc. 




 No. The best movie I've seen is of course my favourite, Der siebente Kontinent (1989). 




 To take an example, 2004 isn't old. And I'm pretty sure the majority with the least interest in movies who hangs out here has seen or knows most of those in the list. Many of them are the most celebrated ones here on Reddit. 




 Not at all. 




 No, but by directors that actually can make something good. 














 Woody Allen. 









 What do you mean with playing it safe? I don't think the majority of critics are writing what the public wants to hear, I think most of them are honest. But then again, I'm no expert in how the majority of critics do their work. By the way, I rather feel that movie critics overall nowadays are even too generous, but that's me.        

Anyways, let's talk about the movie. I thought it was quite bad. I wrote something about it in a similar thread, so what I'm going to say is about the same I said before, but it's always interesting to talk about movies and share your own opinions. For a narrative film of this kind and for it to be an allegory of interest, the story was too simple sided and superficial. In the end, I couldn't care less about anything. The whole movie felt something like a promotional commercial for Die Antwoord, which was silly. And quite everything actually felt silly, stupid, hollow and over the top in a bad way. From the pathetic dialogue to the action and to how it was shot. It's hard to take it seriously, because it doesn't work as a comedy or any kind of critique of something either. It makes me wonder if Blomkamp offered someone from junior high to write him the dialogue.      




 Manhattan (1979). 




 Here's 20 of my favourites that are 90 minutes or under:     

* Csillagosok, katonk (1967) (90 minutes)       
* Gion bayashi (1953) (85 minutes)      
* Hiroshima mon amour (1959) (90 minutes)      
* I fidanzati (1963) (77 minutes)        
* Koridorius (1995) (85 minutes)              
* La jete (1962) (28 minutes)        
* Le rvlateur (1968) (67 minutes)       
* Les yeux sans visage (1960) (88 minutes)      
* Mouchette (1967) (78 minutes)         
* Nattvardsgsterna (1963) (81 minutes)     
* Nun va Goldoon (1996) (78 minutes)      
* Obrazy starho sveta (1972) (70 minutes)          
* Okasareta hakui (1967) (56 minutes)       
* Persona (1966) (85 minutes)       
* Pickpocket (1959) (75 minutes)        
* Procs de Jeanne d'Arc (1962) (65 minutes)      
* Sayat Nova (1969) (79 minutes)         
* Shinjuku maddo (1970) (65 minutes)          
* Un homme qui dort (1974) (77 minutes)       
* Une femme est une femme (1965) (85 minutes)       




 If Studio Ghibli are going to continue, maybe they could do a good job with it. Or if they could team up with Apichatpong Weerasethakul as a director in some way. 




 I think I like Sang sattawat (2006) and Sud sanaeha (2002) the best, especially when they're at their most minimalistic state. He's indeed one of the most interesting directors working today. Really looking forward to his newest movie. 




 Jean-Pierre Laud did an amazing job in Les quatre cents coups (1959). 





























 Oh. This looks really, really bad. The silly slow motion scene with the bullet, the totally tiresome sound effects in these kind of new trailers, the music, and of course the superficial action scenes they probably had to cut in to compensate the total lack of anything of value I guess this movie has. 




 No, I don't have any reason to limit myself that way. Even if I'm not a big fan of a specific actor, I would never refuse to watch a movie because that specific actor is in it, I think it's better to be more open-minded and not refuse to watch movies because of certain actors. There's of course some movies I would rather watch than some others, but I don't have any need to have a definitive list of actors that I absolute refuse to watch. 




 Kes (1969) by Ken Loach. The cast for the film had authentic Yorkshire accents, which isn't maybe the easiest to understand.    

A little bit of trivia:              

*"In a 2013 interview, director Ken Loach said that, upon its release, United Artists organised a screening of the film for some American executive and they said that they could understand Hungarian better than the dialect in the film."* 




 While I like Tonari no Totoro (1988) more, have you seen Gake no ue no Ponyo (2008)? It's also directed by Miyazaki and could be up your alley too. 




 A good one! One of the better war movies, especially when it comes to portraying the real horrors of war. It's very dark, dirty, haunting and has a great atmosphere. 




 I can think of Le manoir du diable (1896) by Georges Mlis. There's supernatural things happening, but not really any death. 




 Ten of the best/my favourite ones:    

* Eraserhead (1977)     
* Hxan (1922)                      
* Les diaboliques (1955)            
* Les yeux sans visage (1960)                
* Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens (1922)                     
* Onibaba (1964)              
* Possession (1981)          
* Repulsion (1965)              
* Spalovac mrtvol (1969)                 
* Yabu no naka no kuroneko (1968)             




 There's certainly not many good ones, but I would go with Antichrist (2009) by Lars von Trier. 




 I have the 2-disc set from Artificial Eye that also comes with Krhozat (1988), but I don't remember where the screen came from exactly, I think I've had it on a computer for a while.  









 I would just take it as your favourite director that has at least one movie in the collection. Andrei Tarkovsky for me. 




 One example is L'eclisse (1962). The end is known for being a bit puzzling for many people, but if you haven't seen everything before the end, it will probably be even more puzzling, especially because the main characters the movie is about aren't present at all near the end. You really must have seen the whole movie to be able to put the end of it in some context at all. 




 Liverpool (2008). 




 I don't just like a long film because it's long, time is irrelevant for me. Why I like Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)? Well, first of all, I'm a big fan of the uncompromising outlook Akerman had with the whole movie. It has pretty much everything I love. Static shots, no soundtrack, toned down performances, long takes, depth, important things to say, a very unsentimental story and just a lot of everydayness. The compositions are clever and smart. The color palette is also very stripped down, which works great with the whole form. It almost the epitome of "show, not tell", since it's not that much dialogue either. I really like minimalism, and Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975) does it perfectly, but still has great depth in both its character portrayal of Jeanne and the images overall. It's probably one of the biggest and most interesting portraits of a woman in the history of cinema. The portrait of Jeanne is both down to earth and realistic. We really get to know her and suffer with her. It's an important movie both as art and social commentary, mostly because of Akerman's depiction of the role women have in society, what we expect from them and the alienation to society and life. It's a feminist masterpiece if you ask me.       

I like when directors manage to catch the hugeness in the little things in life, which I think is something important in cinema. Akerman even had a theory that you have to look at things long enough to really see them, which is a thrilling point. Just like Tarkovsky, the movie has a sort of disruptive feeling of time. When something has that and keeps me thrilled at the same time, I simply have to embrace and love it.      




 I've watched all those, I also mentioned that No Country for Old Men (2007) looks quite okay. I'm more of a fan of cinematographers like Motokichi Hasegawa, Sven Nykvist (mostly his work with Bergman), Vadim Yusov, Gbor Medvigy, Gianni Di Venanzo etc. When it comes to the newer ones, I prefer Liao Pen-jung, some of Christopher Doyle's work, and Fred Kelemen for example. When it comes to movies like Skyfall (2012) or A Beautiful Mind (2001), I feel that they have that typical Hollywood look that a lot of newer movies have. The specific color gradings, the use of lightning, sometimes too much brightness  for my taste and sometimes not that kind of contrast that has a lot of depth which I like. I'm just not too much into the way those movies look. Sometimes it can do much with the directors certain cinematographers work with, so maybe it has a lot do to with that. If Deakins worked with Lav Diaz or Tsai Ming-liang, then the result would possibly be more something for me, I don't know. As I said, he's not bad at his profession, I simply don't want to put him that high up on my own list. 




 Film Art: An Introduction by David Bordwell and Kristin Thompson is a good book to start with. 









 First of all, I haven't seen the movie, so I'm not going to say anything about it's quality, but it still makes me a bit worried and hesitant about it, especially if you know what kind of movies tend to get high ratings. You shouldn't take the IMDb Top 250 that seriously. There's a lot of shadow accounts there, trolls, corrupted votes, people that only use 1 or 10 when they vote etc. And also, any Tom, Dick and Harry can make an account on the site and start voting. I'm not saying that every single user is doing this, but there's absolutely no reason to take the list and the ratings seriously. A big part of the people on IMDb belong to the general public, and I have always felt that the general public isn't the definitive consensus to trust when it comes to cinema, especially not when it comes to a website with that kind of rating system. It's anyways always much more interesting to know what people think about movies if it's those that I know have watched a lot of them, have a lot of knowledge, have studying movies on a more critical and serious level and have a big bubble of references, than just some total strangers I don't know anything about. The IMDb Top 250 is a list by the general Internet public (and possibly some corruption), it's nothing you should look at with a too serious eye. Of course, it's much about taste too. But I think one should have in mind what you are dealing with. For example, people tend to upvote some of the big and newer Hollywood movies like crazy. 




 Of course, just what I said. I can't say I like how movies like The Shawshank Redemption (1994), Skyfall (2012) and A Beautiful Mind (2001) look for example, but Deakins did a better job with No Country for Old Men (2007) to name one. He's good at what he does, I'm just not a huge fan of the majority of his work and how it looks, but that's just my taste. So yeah, there's of course a ton of movies that look much, much worse too. 




 I'm a bit tired of the whole thing with sequels, prequels and remakes in Hollywood today. So I'm not that anticipated for it. Incendies (2010) by Denis Villeneuve wasn't a bad movie, but I can't say I liked Enemy (2013) or the mediocre Prisoners (2013) that much. On the other hand, he is a much better choice as a director than a lot of the other ones working in Hollywood today. I can't say I'm the biggest fan of Roger Deakins either, but there's a lot of worse cinematographers out there too. I'm absolutely going to see the movie though. Blade Runner (1982) is a classic, but not one of my favourites, it will still be interesting to see what will be done with this one nonetheless. 




 I believe the person meant that the movie will be based on the novel by Philip K. Dick. 




  and there was one I watched on Amazon prime about a woman who became a photographer in the late 1800 early 1900s but the title is eluding meat the moment.       

You probably mean Maria Larssons eviga gonblick (2008) by Jan Troell. 




 I don't believe it was chosen at random. As I said, the symbol has been imprinted in the culture of Japan for a long time now. You can see it in a lot of places today. Especially in Japan, from lanterns to Buddhist temples. Even the Ku Klux Klan used it. I didn't say it was a direct reference to the clan, but it's worth to read about it and know that it's been used for a long time in different parts of the world. I haven't seen the movie, but since I know it's about the history of Japan and war, it makes more sense that it wouldn't just be a reference to the game series. 




 Here's my top ten films that are non-English:              

1. Der siebente Kontinent (1989)    
2. Andrey Rublyov (1966)     
3. L'eclisse (1962)     
4. Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)      
5. Tanin no kao (1966)      
6. Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969)      
7. Suna no onna (1964)      
8. Hiroshima mon amour (1959)        
9. Nattvardsgsterna (1963)      
10. Stntang (1994)    

But yeah, a lot of the foreign films were and still are way ahead of Hollywood in so many ways, especially in this day and age. Most of my favourite movies are not English language ones, it just happened to be that way for now. There's so much good foreign stuff. And of course, a lot of bad. But what's good is quite superior if we compare it to Hollywood. It's the same with directors for me, some of my favourites for the moment are Andrei Tarkovsky, Robert Bresson, Ingmar Bergman, Michael Haneke, Kenji Mizoguchi, and Yasujir Ozu. Right now I'm quite into Japanese cinema, particularly from the 1950s to 1970s. It's almost like a constant project going through foreign/world cinema and discovering and watching films from all over the world, it's interesting and fascinating. And when it comes to overshadowing, it really shows how much foreign cinema is overshadowed if we compare it to Hollywood in a subreddit like this. Not a surprise though, just a thoughtful remark. 




 I don't believe it's a reference to the games, it's a very old symbol that has been around in Japanese culture for a long time. And because this is a movie that's about Japanese history, it makes pretty much sense that it wouldn't just be a reference to the game series.

 It's best to ignore it. It's hard to take the majority of people on those boards seriously. There seems to be a lot of trolls too. 




 Thanks! I totally missed that this is coming before you mentioned it. Pre-ordered it today! I can't wait now! 




 And he's holding some Ozu. 




 1. Paris, Texas (1984)      
2. Naked (1993)     
3. A Woman Under the Influence (1974)      
4. Down by Law (1986)    
5. Do the Right Thing (1989)         




 * Hiroshima mon amour (1959)      
* Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)     
* Zerkalo (1975)      




 ICheckMovies has some great and interesting lists. Otherwise it's through books and various film sites etc. 




 Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975). 




 Potential for anything good? Not really. Not if it's going to be in the exact same vein as the previous movies. I feel that it would just be another mainstream franchise that outstayed its welcome. The series was a financial success so far, so I won't be surprised if it actually comes back. I'm just very, very doubtful to the whole thing, but that's me. Especially kids these days would probably like it though. I'm certain that the Shrek series has its fanbase, that's one thing that's sure. If you ask me, I would gladly be without it. 




 That specific quote seems a bit vague. It doesn't say that much for me. Sure, films that scar, make you feel something, stick with you or anything similar are usually those you remember the most and probably stick with you the longest than those movies that are mindless entertainment that you forget about the next day, but it can differ from person to person. People always look for different things in movies, it's always going to be that way. I think Michael Haneke had a great quote going on:      

*"Films that are entertainments give simple answers but I think that's ultimately more cynical, as it denies the viewer room to think. If there are more answers at the end, then surely it is a richer experience."*   

I have to say I agree with Haneke a lot. 




 I don't usually look for something specific and written in rock that a horror movie must have for me to like it. It always depends on what a horror movie does and how it does it, that's the main thing. It can be depth, interesting ideas, playfulness, a great atmosphere or anything that just makes me appretiate it a little extra. Horror movies are mostly best when they're not typical in their genre, but rather challenging, innovative, playful or just about anything that makes them stand out in a good way. I guess it's like with any genre, so it's hard to say. I like for example Possession (1981), Repulsion (1965), Spalovac mrtvol (1969), and Onibaba (1964).        

Now, Funny Games (1997) is maybe more of a thriller than a pure horror film, (and the boundaries can be discussed to death) but that's a great example of what I would like to see more of. Movies that are thinking one step ahead and actually have something interesting to say. 




 Which one are you referring to? Do you mean Lt den rtte komma in (2008) by Tomas Alfredson which has that as the English title? If you do, that's a Swedish movie and not a German one. 




 Som great and essential ones in my opinion:      

* Aguirre, der Zorn Gottes (1972)    
* Chronik der Anna Magdalena Bach (1968)      
* Das weie Band - Eine deutsche Kindergeschichte (2009)     
* Der freie Wille (2006)      
* Der Himmel ber Berlin (1987)      
* Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972)       
* Faust: Eine deutsche Volkssage (1926)       
* Faustrecht der Freiheit (1975)      
* Im Lauf der Zeit (1976)     
* M (1931)      
* Metropolis (1927)      
* Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens (1922)    
* Stroszek (1977)       
* Tagebuch einer Verlorenen (1929)       

Keep an eye out when it comes to directors like Fritz Lang, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Werner Herzog, F.W. Murnau, and Wim Wenders, they have done some of the best stuff when it comes to German cinema. Especially Fassbinder, what a man! He has done many, many great movies. 




 De ofrivilliga (2008) is like Sweden and typical Swedish people in a nutshell. It's almost scary. 




 He's done some good stuff. With no doubt one of the best and coolest directors from Hong Kong for the moment. Maybe even overall. Chung Hing sam lam (1994), Fa yeung nin wa (2000) and Chun gwong cha sit (1997) are my favourites by him.Especially Fa yeung nin wa (2000) must be one of the best films post-2000. I really like the lightning in several of his movies and the use of colors. He's also good at contructing interesting characters that aren't simple and flat, but rather nuanced and at the same time giving the audience both small and fundamental questions about them. There's usually a lot of emotions in the films as well. I'm a bit curious and worried about his latest feature film, Yi dai zong shi (2013), the one about Ip Man, I have to see that one soon. It looks a bit different than some of his other movies. I'm not really a big fan of martial-arts films, so that could also be one reason for my hesitancy.    

When it comes to tracking down Kar-wai's films on DVD, it's quite easy. Criterion Collection released Fa yeung nin wa (2000) on Blu-ray too. And his other ones shouldn't be too hard to find if you look on Amazon and similar sites. I'm happy to help if you have trouble finding something!         

And if we are speaking of similar films, the ones I can think of for now are these three:       

* Bin-jip (2004)       
Kim Ki-duk's movies are mostly either a hit or a miss for me, but this one is probably his best. There's very little dialogue, but I find the relations of the characters to be something similar in the vein of the movies by Kar-wai.            

* Ai qing wan sui (1994)     
More dialogue than the Kim Ki-duk film, but Tsai Ming-liang is much better when it comes to having sparse dialogue. One must check out Tsai Ming-liang if one likes Wong Kar-wai! Ming-liang isn't as straightforward, but I always feel the need to recommend his films. And there's also that similar feeling when it comes to interactions with the characters.         

* Stranger Than Paradise (1984)       
Jim Jarmusch has that special coolness that we can see in Kar-wai as well. Very likeable stuff!     

I don't know if you have seen these three, but it will probably show! 




 It feels like the majority of the movies in that list are big movies people already know of and that already are quite popular on Reddit, for example The Godfather (1972), The Green Mile (1999), Reservoir Dogs (1992), No Country for Old Men (2007), American History X (1999), The Shawshank Redemption (1994) etc. It doesn't have to be a bad thing, but I would love to list some crime dramas that are some of my favourites outside of that list too:      

* Ascenseur pour l'chafaud (1958)     
* Blue Velvet (1986)      
* Du rififi chez les hommes (1955)     
* Le doulos (1962)      
* Le samoura (1967)    
* Le trou (1960)    
* Pickpocket (1959)    
* Pierrot le fou (1965)     
* The Limits of Control (2009)      
* Touchez pas au grisbi (1954)      

None of these are that obscure either, but they're not as well known as some of the big Hollywood classics in the list from the link, so maybe someone discovers something new from my recommendations as well. 




 Sayat Nova (1969) by Sergei Parajanov is a great one. It's a stylized, surreal and beautiful biography of the Armenian poet Sayat Nova. Parajanov was more interested in revealing the poet's life in a visual and poetic way rather than literally. One interesting fact is that Sofiko Chiaureli played six different characters in the movie. There's no real dialogue or any camera movement either. 




 I agree, this should be a standard everywhere. It would especially benefit those who have impaired hearing too. 




 A cracker. According to the Silent Era website, the survival status seems to be unknown, same with the current rights holder. Even the following is stated on the site: "It is unclear whether this film was actually produced."   


Your best shot will probably be to come in contact with the production company, Regia Kunstfilms Co. and/or DFI (Danish Film Institute) and see what they say. 




 Nobi (1959) by Kon Ichikawa is great. War, starvation, absurdity and chaos. 




 I wouldn't say that always suck, it really depends on how they are made etc. But there's of course a lot of bad examples. On the other hand, Andrei Tarkovsky made some of the most amazing dream sequences ever. Zerkalo (1975), Stalker (1979), Nostalghia (1983) and Offret (1986) have all great and beautiful dream sequences. 

Ingmar Bergman really said it:      
*"Tarkovsky for me is the greatest (director), the one who invented a new language, true to the nature of film, as it captures life as a reflection, life as a dream."* 




 Get some from Criterion Collection and Eureka (Masters of Cinema), they have a lot of great movies. L'eclisse (1962), Pickpocket (1959) and Seppuku (1962) are some that I really recommend. 




  Not your favorite movies, but the ones you think influenced the filmmaking industry, or are perfectly told stories.

That's making it a little irrelevant, complicated and strange. It's not always that or this way. Someones favourite movies could be perfectly told stories, the perfectly told stories one prefers could be movies the person thinks influenced filmmaking in big ways etc. Reasons can hang together and differ. For example, my favourite movies are the same as the ones I think are the best of all time. So here they are:      

1. Der siebente Kontinent (1989)       
2. Andrey Rublyov (1966)    
3. L'eclisse (1962)     
4. Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)     
5. Tanin no kao (1966)     
6. Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969)       
7. Suna no onna (1964)        
8. Hiroshima mon amour (1959)     
9. Nattvardsgsterna (1963)      
10. Stntang (1994)        




 Krhozat (1988) is great and there's a lot of rain in it. 




  He would often ask his actors to perform the same scene 60 times in a row, until all pretensions of acting and "constructedness" would disappear and what would be left were the words, plain and simple.    

This isn't completely true. It's mostly a rumour people spread around, that he made them repeat something like that so much. In Ingela Romare's book about Bresson, there is a long interview with him where he said that it's false and just rumour about his way of working. He simply made his models utter a sentence and asked them to not think about what they were saying. He could also ask them to think about something else than the content in what they were saying.      




 I think you are missing a lot. First of all, to understand Robert Bresson you have to forget all about how a film "should be". I suggest reading Notes sur le cinmatographe (also published in English as Notes on the Cinematographer), there you will find his own kind of "rules", formulas and guidelines when it comes to cinema. He used it a lot in his own films. Robert Bresson despised the way in which the majority of films were made. He was of the opinion that the majority of cinema was filmed theatre, that's why he created a new sort of film language, his own cinematography. I would also suggest to not even think of comparing Lynch with him, that's just pointless from the beginning. Both of them have made some great films, but they don't have much in common at all. To make it easier, Bresson's style doesn't have much in common with much at all.           

Bresson wanted to separate cinema from the theater, he stripped the cinema to only the bare essentials. He was quite interested in other artforms, such as literature and painting, so much in his style is influenced from those fields rather than film. Look at the acting for example. The people in Bresson's movies were called models by him, he didn't want to call them actors at all. The point with his kind of "acting" was to make the models say their lines in a kind of automatic way, which didn't have focus on them making a performance, but rather acheiving automatism. In my opinion, this also had an effect that made it subtle, powerful and raw. And therefore it also left room to fill the characters with your own emotions, aside from those you already got from the beginning.     

The people in his movies were taken from life, Bresson required that they didn't have any connection to film or theater. Have in mind that I mostly speak of his later films now, his earlier movies were not made the same way. Anyways, he used people which were not taught to be natural. Classic acting had a learned naturalness, something which was absurd to him. The people in his films were supposed to be (models), not pretend to be (actors). Bresson even tried to not use the same model twice. Everything from the theatrical expressions was meant to be taken away, that was the point in which Bresson wanted to bring out the authenticity, a realism in the way of just being human. Facial expressions, movements, gestures and voices, everything was supposed to be as neutral as possible. This is something that was the total opposite of typical acting, because Bresson felt that typical acting was closer to the theater than to cinema. A person who has been indoctrinated in the theater when it comes to expression, that person can't show genuine emotions on screen, that would just be emotions that have been learned, which equals fake emotions. Bresson was interested in the purely "physical" in people. He didn't tell which feelings he wanted his models to show, he just gave them physical instructions such as how the model should move, what the model should look at etc.      

He was also a perfectionist and a minimalist. That means every image, sound, move etc. is supposed to be there and has its own meaning of being there. This is why many of his movies are a bit shorter than your average flick. This guy stripped cinema to the bare essentials, but still managed to make huge art. The thing with Bresson is the special relationship between images and sounds together with important questions about human beings, it's so special that you won't really find it anywhere else, not like in his movies. It's just pure film magic in my opinion. Some people can watch films all their life and still not understand Bresson, which isn't shocking at all, because you really need to study his style to truly understand him, I'm almost certain that you barely scratched the surface of this man and his movies, especially if you think his visual style is "dull", that it's "lacking" and when you say you don't see the point. Study, read his book, watch his films, and examine critically. This can take years, but understanding Bresson isn't something you do after two or three of his movies. It takes time. We are not talking about taste now, have that in mind. We are just talking about understanding. I also have a great book about him by Ingela Romare, but it's in Swedish, so it's a bit hard to recommend if it isn't your first language. There may be something else you could find in English though (besides his own book). Anyways, If you have the interest to understanding Bresson properly, you have to commit and do it properly. Good luck if you want it. And don't rush. 














 I think it will suck too. Just like the first one. It was just silly and trying too hard. Talk about cheap jokes. No finesse or charm whatsoever. 




 Norte, hangganan ng kasaysayan (2013) by Lav Diaz. 




 You maybe feel that way because the movies by John Carpenter and George Romero were a big influence on the film's compositions and visual aesthetic. Wide-angle lenses were also used to help give the film its look. The soundtrack obviously echoes Carpenter too. 




 Here are all of them:       

* Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969)        
* Chinatown (1974)      
* Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964)      
* The Godfather: Part II (1974)

 One of the best westerns ever made. Amazing soundtrack and memorable characters. A true classic that's very rewatchable. I got sad when I heard that Eli Wallach died. It's almost been a year now. 




 It was quite silly, yeah. But I didn't really expect it to be great, especially as Nolan never impressed me before. I find him quite mediocre. I have been talking about it in some threads before, so I'm probably going to repeat myself, but I disliked Interstellar (2014) mostly because Nolan seems to be unable to tell with pictures. Everything is already explained with dialogue and/or voice-over, there is nothing left to the imagination. But that's probably because the film is so flat and empty that there isn't anything left to leave to the viewer. To make it as unsubtle and clear as possible seems to be Nolan's last hope of deceiving himself and the audience that there is something in the movie and that it's smart.      
Matthew McConaughey's character is paraphrasing and saying that the world only consists of crafsmen, but lacks of visionaries. That's quite funny, because Nolans doesn't really have any visions at all.      

The soundtrack by Zimmer is also all over the place and so pompous and nobby that it feels more like a parody. On top of that, the screenplay had ancient gender roles, doubtful New Age philosophy about love and a lot of silly crying.     

About the IMDb Top 250, that's something one shouldn't pay attention to at all. Everyone can make an account and start voting on that site. A lot of the votes are corrupt, people create fake accounts, some users only use 1 and 10 when rating etc. It's hard to take it seriously, the whole top list is better off being ignored. Another thing, you don't have to be missing something just because you didn't like a movie, it can rather be the movie that's missing something. Everything doesn't have to be so single sided. 














 Hulu Plus seems to be something for you. They pretty much have nearly everything Criterion released and some more. Fandor and Mubi could be something worth looking into also. Another thing to consider is visiting libraries, they actually have more stuff than you think. It's of course not the same everywhere, but it's worth a shot. Don't forget about YouTube either, you can find a lot of classic films there. Many are in the public domain, so those are free and totally legal. 




 George Clooney's first film wasn't From Dusk Till Dawn (1996). He started acting in the late seventies, made his first role ever in 1978 (in a mini-series) and his first movie role in And They Are Off (1982). 




 Threse three are great and a lot more mature than the typical fantasy stuff:       

* Der Himmel ber Berlin (1987)      
* Duelle (une quarantaine) (1976)   
* Ugetsu monogatari (1953)        




 Wu Wu Mian (2015) by Tsai Ming-liang, great short. You can watch it here:         
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2MJ68jedKc 




 Ten of my favourite ones:    

* Eraserhead (1977)     
* Hxan (1922)                      
* Les diaboliques (1955)            
* Les yeux sans visage (1960)                
* Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens (1922)                     
* Onibaba (1964)              
* Possession (1981)          
* Repulsion (1965)              
* Spalovac mrtvol (1969)                 
* Yabu no naka no kuroneko (1968)             




 It's going to be a lot of movies for you if everyone is going to give you three films from each year starting from 2000 until now. And of the ones I have seen and rated from that span, I haven't given a single one more than a 4/5 rating, and those that got it are less than forty movies all together. So I'm going to give you fifteen of the best films I have seen from 2000 until now that I really recommend:       

* A torini l (2011)          
* Book chon bang hyang (2011)    
* Cach (2005)     
* Das weie Band - Eine deutsche Kindergeschichte (2009)             
* Fa yeung nin wa (2000)     
* Mies vailla menneisyytt (2002)     
* Mulholland Dr.	(2001)       
* My Winnipeg (2007)     
* Ni neibian jidian (2001)       
* No Quarto da Vanda (2000)       
* Norte, hangganan ng kasaysayan (2013)      
* The Act of Killing (2012)      
* The Limits of Control (2009)      
* Werckmeister harmnik (2000)          
* White Material (2009)       




 I'm not really surprised. 




  This Transient Life (1970)      

I have to rewatch that one soon. So damn good! 









 Yaju no seishun (1963). Seijun Suzuki did some good action in the 60s. 




 Der siebente Kontinent (1989). 




 I haven't seen Transformers (2007) yet. 




 No female character's dream, big motivation, ambition or idea, is really truly their own. They're not really independent. It's quite interesting to consider that the role of Murph was originally written for a male too. But that later changed. Anyways, what I am trying to say is that the independence of the women in the film only go so far as to make it work mostly for the big male figure in their existance. The women are dependant on their so called hopes to make their special big male figure proud, and in the end also to complete his lifelong dream, not really their own.     
Much of the movie moves along according to men and that they are the dynamic ones, which leaves women in reactive positions. Every woman seems to be forced to hold onto the hand of the big male figure that abandoned them. None of the women would have their ambitious striving without a so called strong, adventurous, independent and lovable male lead. To make it short, this is just some of the problems the movie has, so I hope I have given you some answers to your curiosity. 




 I agree that it's overrated. I dislike it mostly because Nolan is unable to tell with pictures. Everything is already explained with dialogue and/or voice-over, there is nothing left to the imagination. There is nothing that is subtle. The soundtrack by Zimmer is just all over the place and so pompous and nobby that it feels more like a parody. On top of that, the screenplay had tiresome gender roles, doubtful New Age philosophy about love and a lot of crying. 




 The movie you are looking for is Kurutta ippji (1926) by Teinosuke Kinugasa. Good stuff. I recently got it on DVD, but the transfer wasn't really that good. It really deserves a nice restoration, a Blu-ray release would be amazing. It's just sad that the existing print of it is missing a big part of the film too. By the way, when it was screened in Japan in the 1920s, it would have included live narration by a storyteller or so called benshi as well as musical accompaniment. 




 This is what you should be looking after:     
  
* A torini l (2011)       
* Der siebente Kontinent (1989)     
* Krhozat (1988)     
* Nattvardsgsterna (1963)     
* L'amour  mort (1984)       
* Le feu follet (1963)      
* No Quarto da Vanda (2000)     
* Offret (1986)       
* Petla (1958)      
* Pisma myortvogo cheloveka (1986)       
* Stntang (1994)       
* Viskningar och rop (1972)     
* Werckmeister harmnik (2000)      




 Woody Allen. 




 One of the most beautiful movies I've watched this year is Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969). Amazing cinematography. It doesn't make it worse that it's a very complex and interesting look at sex, history and politics. It's what I would call aesthetic perfection! Some user here on Reddit posted an album with screenshots from it, here is a (NSFW) link: http://imgur.com/a/MAxel          




 I'm guessing it could be Rak ti Khon Kaen (2015) by Apichatpong Weerasethakul. But if Lav Diaz, Michael Haneke and Abbas Kiarostami all come out with a new film this year, it could be one of theirs. 




 Easy one. Max von Sydow. One of his most memorable roles for me is as Karl Oskar in Utvandrarna (1971) and Nybyggarna (1972) by Jan Troell. 




 "Top-tier" directors is maybe subjective, I would for example not put Guy Ritchie anywhere near the top of anything. And well known doesn't always mean that someone is good, so we have that part too.

But to answer your question, I think Jeanne Moreau would probably be the hardest one to beat in the first place. Just look at this list of the directors she has worked with: 

* Michelangelo Antonioni    
* Luis Buuel   
* Louis Malle      
* Jacques Becker   
* Marguerite Duras    
* Tsai Ming-liang   
* Jean Renoir       
* Rainer Werner Fassbinder   
* Manoel de Oliveira      
* Franois Truffaut    
* Marcel Ophls      
* Joseph Losey      
* Orson Welles   
* Elia Kazan      
* Theo Angelopoulos    
* Wim Wenders     




 Bronenosets Potemkin (1925) by Sergei M. Eisenstein. The ultimate one. One of the most influential films in the history of cinema, the montage techniques in it are as relevant and important today as it was in the 1920s. Early propaganda movies from the Soviet Union is what you should look into if you want to see montage editing at its best. 




 Il sorpasso (1962). Great road movie about an impulsive and extroverted excitement seeker who meets an introverted and straitlaced law student. A hell of a ride. 




 Have you seen Smultronstllet (1957) by Ingmar Bergman? If not, that is the ultimate one. 




 I think it was because of the cover art and/or the extras. 




 Der Himmel ber Berlin (1987) is probably the best one. A great portrait of the contemporary West Berlin from the eighties.     

Some other ones that are very good:       

* Der letzte Mann (1924)         
* Despair (1978)          
* Die Ehe der Maria Braun (1979)       
* Die dritte Generation (1979)      
* M (1931)      
* Possession (1981)      

Worth mentioning too:       

* Germania anno zero (1948)       
* Menschen am Sonntag (1930)     
* Variet (1925)        

I would also recommend to check out Fassbinder's massive and epic Berlin Alexanderplatz (1980) if you have the time. It's more of a mini-series, but was made to be a single film, so the limitations can be discussed on that part, but it's a very interesting depiction of Berlin in the late-1920s. All hail Fassbinder! 




 It was already announced two months ago, it was just postponed a bit. 









 Mulholland Dr. (2001) is a must watch. 




 None of them. I watch what I want to watch. I have never used those sites to be sure if I should watch anything or not. 









 Some of my absolute favourite war films:            

* Apocalypse Now (1979)       
* Csillagosok, katonk (1967)       
* Idi i smotri (1985)      
* Ivanovo detstvo (1962)       
* L'arme des ombres (1969)        
* La battaglia di Algeri (1966)       
* Lacombe Lucien (1974)       
* Nobi (1959)      
* Paths of Glory (1957)      
* Popil i diament (1958)       
* Voskhozhdenie (1977)         




 Solyaris (1972), the best movie ever when it comes to space and science fiction. 




 I think I would choose Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969). It would probably be amazing. 




 Favourite actress: Setsuko Hara	   
Favourite actor: Chish Ry         
Favourite director: Andrei Tarkovsky       
Favourite movie: Der siebente Kontinent (1989)        




 I rather feel that bland visuals, no emotions, doing many things and the loud and clear message also applies to movies that aren't independent. I can see these kind of things in both independent movies and the big mainstream blockbusters from Hollywood for example. So the so called mistakes are quite common in pretty much films of all kinds, I don't think they should only be paired together with movies that are independent. The indie label just states that a movie is produced outside of the major film studio system, completely or partly, it doesn't actually say anything else, something that many people believe. Also, if someone feels that a movie is incomprehensible, it doesn't have to be the director's mistake, it could rather be the viewer's fault, something worth to remember. It doesn't always have to be that one sided. 




 1. Norte, hangganan ng kasaysayan (2013)      
2. Book chon bang hyang (2011)     
3. A torini l (2011)        




 I don't know where you got something Japanese from. Maybe you answered the wrong person? Funny Games (1997) is an Austrian movie in German. The remake is in English. 




 Norte, hangganan ng kasaysayan (2013) by Lav Diaz is the best movie I've seen from the last two years. Really great. I can really recommend it. 




 Yeah, you could say that. 




 It's not really that different. Actors and the language aren't the same, but that's mostly it. They're both directed by Haneke. The remake was just aimed for the American audience. 









 Funny Games (1997) is some good stuff. 




 Yaj no seishun (1963) or Buta to gunkan (1961). 




 Some of the better ones working today:   

* Abbas Kiarostami          
* Aki Kaurismki	      
* Aleksandr Sokurov         
* Apichatpong Weerasethakul      
* David Lynch      
* Hirokazu Koreeda     
* Hong Sang-soo       
* Jafar Panahi      
* Jean-Luc Godard       
* Jim Jarmusch       
* Lav Diaz      
* Michael Haneke   
* Pedro Costa          
* Peter Greenaway    
* Tsai Ming-liang         




 I can't see the real challenge in it. It isn't as hard as you may think. Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972), Tky monogatari (1953), La libertad (2001), Le rvlateur (1968), Bu san (2003), and Akibiyori (1960) are some examples I can think of after some seconds. And they don't have any certain plot holes really. Also, there's a lot of more experimental/avant-garde movies that could fit, same with many shorts. My examples were movies with a more standard narrative though. It all depends on where you want to draw the line and how picky you want to be. 




 My favourite is La jete (1962) by Chris Marker. 




 * Andrey Rublyov (1966)    
* Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969)    
* Stntang (1994)     




 It sounds like When a Stranger Calls Back (1993) by Fred Walton, could it be it? 




 Naked Lunch (1991) and Where the Buffalo Roam (1980). 









 I don't think it's odd at all. I think it's rather great that people dress however they want when they're directing a movie and not going after some special dress code. There's no reason for it. It can get rather hectic, hot, excruciating and stressful on a movie set, therefore people probably show up in what feels best and comfortable for them in that kind of situation. Taste is also subjective. 




 La jete (1962) by Chris Marker and Je t'aime je t'aime (1968) by Alain Resnais. 




 Here are five of the best ones I have seen:     

* Csillagosok, katonk (1967)    
* J'accuse! (1919)     
* Paths of Glory (1957)   
* La grande illusion (1937)    
* The Big Parade (1925)         




 Still hoping for Woody Allen. 




 Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972) by Rainer Werner Fassbinder. A true masterpiece. 




 Some great examples I really like:

* Les rendez-vous d'Anna (1978)         
Anna, a female director is on tour for her newest film. She goes from France to Germany and back to Paris. While in Germany, she travels around there a bit and we get to see the people she meets.         

* Saraba natsu no hikari (1968)     
Kawamura is a professor touring Europe. He meets Naoko, a married woman living in Paris, scarred by the Nagasaki atomic bombings. A romance blooms and they travel around Europe trying to find themselves.        

* Stroszek (1977)        
Street singer and former mental patient Bruno teams up with a prostitute and an older man to travel from Germany to the United States in search for a better life.        

* Topio stin omichli (1988)       
A road movie about two children (Voula and Alexandre) searching for their father who dissapeared, but is supposed to live in Germany.     




 You have to check out Posetitel muzeya (1989) and Pisma myortvogo cheloveka (1986) by Konstantin Lopushanskiy. Both have a very similar post-apocalyptic vibe. Lopushanskiy also worked as a production assistant on Stalker (1979). 




 Dreyer! Thumbs up. Such a great movie.
