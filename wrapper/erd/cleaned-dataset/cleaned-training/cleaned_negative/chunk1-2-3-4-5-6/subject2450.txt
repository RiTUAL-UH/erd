 It leaves people of color who have saved the housing stock to start over in another neighborhood and not reap the benefits of their good work. 




 Where do they move? Eventually some of them move into a box in some back alley. 




 You are correct my experience was in in the 70s, 80s and 90s in New York City maybe the process has changed. However, it is does not change the fact that lower income people are displaced and Whites end up with a desirable neighborhood. 




 Renters leave because they can not afford the neighborhood prices and rents.

Home owners leave in the second wave as home prices rise and commodity prices rise. Their $60,000 home is sold for $200,000. The home is resold for $400,000. The home owners do make money but miss out on the windfall.

The end result Whites takeover a neighborhood in which the people of color have protected the housing stock for decades. 




 Having been pioneers of gentrification in a number of neighborhoods I find the study flawed. I am White. I saw the vast majority of people of color displaced. First the renters went but then the home owners sold out because the money they were offered were too much for them not to accept. Also the prices in stores changed upward forcing lower income home owners to seek more affordable communities. 

One neighborhood changed from African-American to White and in the other Hispanic/African-American to White. Just because you don't have to move the economics may make moving the best alternative. In the end the benefits of the new gentrified community changes are lost to the long-time residents renters and home owners.

 I doubt that the victims of unsolved murders are 50/50 White and African American since the majority of murder victims are people of color. 

You seem to be justifying the disparity in solved vs. unsolved cases. When you see a racial disparity our first instinct should be to see these differences in light of our history of racism. What I am seeing in this discussion is an attempt to justify the facts by blaming the victims.

 When did police have to have the most unreliable evidence, eyewitness accounts, to solve murders. 




 The fixation on "no snitching" as the reason for the higher rate of unsolved murders of Black victims seems to be an attempt to excuse often shoddy police work in poorer neighborhoods. Often the victims are people police consider criminal themselves. Lets not blame poor police work on the African-American community. That's blaming the victims.

By staying we say we will not be driven out by your arbitrary actions meant to drive away progressives.

 You take on Snooves, who once tried to ban me for posting too frequently from the AP. I want to expand it to the current state of the mods.

Mods like GuitarFreak027 and avnerd have little or no interest in r/politics looking at their user histories. Yet these two mods got or retained full permissions on this site. Others like maxwellhill, anutensil, mrmajorly and Samuel_Gompers who used to have full mod status are relegated to secondary roles even though they are regular participants.

It is these actions along with the banned list that make it seem like there has been a coup. When we look at the political make up of the mods the site has seemed to take a severe turn to the right. This is not a left or progressive site put it does have a majority of users who are left of center. 

The community didn't lose default status because we were too left but because the discussion too often was toxic. The way to improve the site is not to kick out those left of center but to moderate the tone of the community.

The mods have lost the trust of many us and we ask them to reconsider their decisions and restart. There is no shame in going back and redoing what has already been done. I don't see any other way for the mods to regain our trust.

Take a deep breathe and lets give it another try. 




 It is not a loophole but a recognition by the federal government that Native peoples are sovereign peoples living within the borders of the US. They follow our federal laws just like other states but they can make their own local laws. Even under these circumstances Native people populate the US military in greater proportions to their actual population than any other racial group in this country. So I don't see they are getting anything that they don't deserve or are owed. 




 Tribes have casinos, do not collect cigarette taxes, have their own justice system not because some state which was built on and around their lands gave them anything. Tribal rights are protected by treaties just like the ones the US has with most of the nations of the world. Understand Native peoples were here before there were states.

 Now the crescendo of Republicans saying we're not racists. If it walks like a duck, talks like a duck it's a duck.

Until the GOP takes positive actions to remove racists from their ranks they will have to live with this analysis. 




 I guess the US constitution is not the constitution that governs Louisiana. 




 The only one worth impeaching is Cruz but I don't see where his actions have violated the Constitution. 




 That is because the Australian system is built to encourage voting and the US system is more and more about excluding voters. 




 President Obama saying the US will never forget 911 would not be world news. 




 Even if the tax liability is less then $2.4 billion, the idea that a company could can stash $8 billion in profits earned in US out of the reach of the government for whatever reason is an important story. 




 There are three types of ethics stories: it's illegal; it's unethical: it ought to be illegal or unethical. This story certainly falls into the third category. 




 The $8 billion is profits diverted. The $2.4 billion is the taxes that would have been paid on the $8 billion.  




 Or there will be a call to return to voting privileges for male property holders. 




 When GOP can not win using the current rules they just change the rules. This is what Republicans mean when they talk about democracy. 




 Isn't it amazing that Borowitz is so much smarter then Issa. 




 The headline I used was the original story headline when I posted the story.

 This is what the right would say is a win-win. Usually when this phrase is used it means the rich wins and everyone else loses (they say win). 




 This bill doesn't have a chance outside of the House. This bill is not about winning but currying favor with the mineral and energy extraction industries. It does put the GOP firmly in the anti-park and preservation camp. 




 So employers should be allowed to bar African-Americans  or other people of color because of their religious beliefs? That is the logical extension of your reasoning. 




 The idea they will serve no jail time will serve notice to others that the destruction of ancient formations are punishable with a slap on the wrist.

 McConnell and dignity aren't usually mentioned in the same sentence. 




 Making thousands on tens of thousands of trades adds up. 




 It is cheating to the GOP when you use the law to combat Republican attacks on poor people. 




 Republicans only support states rights when they agree with the states. 




 You know that is racist. 




 The Arab Spring was about opening up the political process to opposing views. The return to autocratic rule by the military has arrested the gains made during the last three years.  




 Iraq's close relations with Iran may mean they or their allies may get some of these weapons. Also Iraq move to a more authoritarian government seems to indicate that the weapons may end up being used on political opponents not supposed "terror organizations." 




 This is not going to turn out well. 




 It seems obvious but the idea that one party, the Republicans, are fighting to maintain that inequality should galvanize the rest of us to fight like hell to end that gap. 




 Kentucky has a strong tradition of trade unions even though they are a border state. 




 The OP supports US troops leaving.

 Yes, the Democrats are standing up to the Koch's but they need to standup to more of the monied interests that have been whittling away at safety, health and environmental regulations. 




 This is the slippery slope that was talked about when we ramped up security post 9-11. The CIA is prohibited from spying in the US and forget about the Senate. 




 Another blew against those who believe there is no pay inequality for women. 




 I don't think having a gun would solve this situation, unless you're talking about killing a law enforcement officer. That wouldn't be the the smartest solution. 




 And somehow CCA is more accountable. CCA has been running a hellhole of a prison in Idaho for years and the government is just now getting around to investigate them. 




 It is nice the Border Patrol decided to join the 21st century. The days of shooting rock throwers in the US ended decades ago, I thought. 




 To Republicans John McCain and Mitt Romney are moderates. 




 Pussy Riot was making a political statement about the role of the church in the "new" Russia. 




 Being famous. However, they are not in it for the money. Once again they are political performance artists not recording stars. 




 That can only mean they're in it for the money. s/

If they were money motivated they could have left Russia come to the US or UK and made a bundle. They did not. They are more political than musical. 




 Pussy Riot is not doing this for publicity they are political performance artists. This is about social commentary. 




 This is just one more attack on copyright laws.

Edited: Misspelled copyright 




 They don't sell albums they are political performance artists. 




 I don't know if most Russians are barbarians but most are afraid of any more change. They made one change in the last thirty years, a second change would be extremely hard. Pussy Riot is at the forefront of the next wave. 




 I don't know if that is the question.  Given the choice of standing idly by or fighting for what they believe in they have chosen the later. By leaving they would never have any influence over how Russia turns out. 




 But would you leave where you live if "far right authoritarians" took over power? One can flee or fight. Pussy Riot has chosen to fight and we should applaud them for their bravery. 




 They stay because they are not willing to leave the land that they love to the "far-right, authoritarian(s)" Would you? 




 Happy Cake Day! 




 It is popular among cultural snobs to dislike ComFest. They see themselves as being so much cooler than the event. What they forget is ComFest is whatever you want it to be.  




 Fat chance. Duke Energy runs NC along with Art Pope. Probably the best that can be expected is another fine. Hopefully the fine will be significant but somehow I doubt it.  




 The Chilean military was working with the US military before and after the coup. Please understand without US support there would not have been a coup.

 Good to see Ken Cuccinelli landed on his feet. /s

 Allende presente! 




 This is another Ham boondoggle. He is using the local government to lower his interest rate and then building an Ark which at best would be valued in the millions not multi-millions. 




 As we know US intelligence is always accurate. The fact that he is acting behind the scenes leads to real questions if he is who the US says he is. Killing him is the easy way out not the best way. 




 I find your use of the term "backwater ape" to be an offensive choice of wording at best and racist at worse. I'd hope you'd reconsider your comment. 




 Yes, cars have been a public health issue. That is why air bags and seat belts were added. Manufacturers added other safety features to make vehicles safer because so many people died using their product. 




 It is always something other than the guns. When so many people stop dying from guns it will not be a public health issue. 




 Will they change their minds if Gov. Brewer vetoes the bill? The actions of the legislature on this and other issues should make the Hispanic National Bar decide to stay home veto or not. 




 If one was looking for a worse case scenario, I'd choose a school district police force with AR-15s and school kids. 




 It is news to the GOP. 




 Not the case with Cruz but is true about W. 




 You are correct but not many are down right stupid. Many may lack common sense or well developed deductive reasoning but they have something upstairs to be at Harvard. 




 It is not that Harvard educated Cruz is not intelligent but rather that he is more interested in moving the GOP to the right than trying to prove that he is the smartest guy in the room. 




 These facts have had little impact on far-right and the conservative religious community in the US. 




 That's correct but the use of scientists to somehow verify his position is quite unusual. I know he is looking for a way out but the opposition will see thru his charade. 




 What plausible theory about homosexuals would call for their imprisonment?  




 What do scientists have to do with homosexuality? 




 This is what the GOP is best at deregulation. 




 The "may have" relates to the number of dead not the fact that civilians were killed. 




 This is the confirmation of those reports. 




 Stop talking sense. Where would libertarians be without conspiracies about the Fed, detention camps and the Trilateral Commission? 




 Not quite sure that this journalism or propaganda but it certainly will have some impact on newsgathering. 




 Then they don't want to be in the EU. It is their choice but I'm sure their economy will take a big hit if they ditch the EU. 




 To some a mystery is only made better by spinning it into a conspiracy.  




 I don't know if  this is an accounting issue but a contractual issue. More than likely the contract CCA has with Idaho calls for a minimum number of correctional officers on duty at a given time. These accounting errors allowed CCA to pay less in guard time than their contract called for. 




 Since the system is Linux based that is really possible. To go one step further in spy v. spy mode program in your adversaries facial features so if he captures the weapon he would shoot himself.

 This is not extraordinary news but how many people thought that Afghan forces would deteriorate this badly before the US forces left the country. 




 At some point he will have to answer the question if he wants to President. Better that he answers the question two years before the primaries not in the middle of the election. 




 Didn't hurt dope fiends Bush, Clinton and Obama become president. 




 No one is questioning him for being a hypocrite but rather that in 2014 he could not say he smoked. Presidents Clinton, Bush and Obama all have admitted smoking.  Who cares if a Senator from Florida smoked a joint? 




 Why it so hard for politicians to admit they smoked? They are living in the 1980s not the 21st century. 




 After the 4th if the Republicans gain control of the Senate their insanity will reach new heights. 




 And all African-Americans are lazy and all Jews are cheap. /s 




 Are the Europeans saying they will allow "too big to fail" banks to go under? 




 I's like to see a separate Environmental Justice category. Am I missing solar, wind and nuclear power? Where would cutting edge technologies like thermal and tidal fit in? I would also like a category for activism.

 Once a buffoon always a buffoon. 




 How much money have the Republicans returned to corporate criminals like Bob Murray, the Koch brothers or Art Pope? This is just another Rand Paul political ploy to get him on TV. 




 We're too interested in Chris Christie, Sochi and Philip Seymour Hoffman. If only some celebrity or sporting event was happening in North Carolina people would be more interested. 




 Actually, yes. They did look similar to his art. It's funny, people see a big nose and scream jew. Actually, that's fucking hilarious. People so concerned with walking on eggshells that they make themselves more retarded. 

What makes people look retarded is their attempts to excuse away stereotyping bankers as Jews. This is common imaginary even though most bankers are not Jewish. The idea that you have no sensitivity to the stereotyping says more about you and your political baggage. 




 I don't know how real this bill is or just a ploy to gain for votes for Sen. Vitter in his race for Governor. 




 Republicans have always claimed they are better for the economy even though the data proves this claim false. The problem is many voters believe it is true. 




 Maybe Republicans can now understand the CBO report. I doubt it. They never let the facts get in the way of their talking points.

The other part of these 2.3 million FTE jobs is that that they are not being lost but unfilled. Some of those hours will go to the unemployed lowering even further the unemployment rate. Now that is real scary to the GOP and their talking point that the economy can not and will not improve under a Democrat. 




 If the sides were Lutherans vs. Methodists would you st that? 




 Notice he didn't say he didn't do it but rather he is being targeted for political reasons. 




 Why file charges after he failed to have any impact on the 2012 election? D'Souza seems to be logic challenged. 




 There is no might when you give money to your friends to make campaign contributions in their name to avoid contribution limits. 




 I'm  interested in a felony conviction with some jail time. I think a plea deal will involve no jail time and what message will that send. 




 Please no plea deal. It is time to show these offenders that this is not some joke where the only penalty is a slap on the wrist. These are felonies and those who destroy our parks should be treated as felons. 




 The national media is leading with this story on the nightly news. Christie's ship may have sailed. 




 The battle for the supposed soul of the GOP is staring to heat up again.

 The conspiracists believe that the world is run by a cabal while the gullible have not yet fully bought into all the theories.  




 Conspiracists know and look for conspiracies. Gullible people believe it is true but don't necessarily believe that all these conspiracies are tied together in a world view. 




 I've said my piece. 




 There are no conversations just trolling. 




 Another in a long line of offenses done by President Obama which were perfectly fine and necessary under a Republican President. 




 It seems like you don't understand that you are a controversial figure. The way to back down the rhetoric is not to want to lead every subreddit in which your name is mentioned. 

You mod enough communities to gain experience. You do not need to add another one to your belt. 

Other communities may not mind you but there are a significant number that do. But if all you want is a fight then continue to demand to be added to this and every other subreddit that disagrees with you. 




 Why do you have to mod every subreddit that wants to question your motive and intentions? Why not be like any other redditor and engage in discussion without having to have the power?   




 Who knows if u/Luster is not an alt for u/TheRedditPope. All I know is u/luster has a bad attitude, conservative politics and overreaches in trying to stifle his enemies. 




 The idea that you want to be a mod r/politicalmoderation just bolsters the belief that all you are interested in is stifling discussion on Reddit. It doesn't matter how good or bad a moderator you are. By allowing you to mod this site you will successfully mute this community. It seems your only interest is in stopping people from fingering you for the damage you have caused to our communities. 

The name of of this website is Reddit not TheRedditPope. You want influence at this subreddit speak but leave the moderating to others who are more capable and honest.

 Why are you getting involved in this discussion? I thought you are no longer a moderator of r/politics. It was pulled but it may be back now to save face. 

Here is the comment made to me by Luster in a response to mod mail.

[I did not remove it, but I agree with its removal](http://www.reddit.com/message/messages/1hy7uq)

You can see Luster later in the thread is looking to ban me for being a shill for the AP, the largest new organization in the US. He doesn't even know how AP works. I have never been paid by AP for writing anything. But facts probably will not be enough to stop the r/politics mods from doing what they are going to do. 




 Or when you've destroyed your target you move on. Please don't let the door hit you in the ass. 




 My comment to them:

The man whose song, We Shall Overcome, was adopted to lead the Civil Rights movement; the man whose songs led the Vietnam War protests; a leader in the struggle for human rights, social justice has died but his death is off-topic for politics. I really don't know what country you live in. This is one insult too many. Please leave the stage now your judgement is flawed. Your rules are inane and your political prejudices are too big.

 He was the voice of generations of social activists. While many people may think they don't know Pete's music his obit show that his songs are part of the fabric of the world's musical fabric. He was a giant. He will be missed. Goodnight Pete. 




 From Cuba to South Africa from Selma to San Francisco the world is a little less joyful without Pete. His influence on millions through his activism and music was an inspiration to generations. I know his music will continue to influence millions more for years to come. Goodnight Pete.

 Thanks for pointing out that some progressive/left sites are not stellar examples of journalism. That doesn't mean they should be banned but they should not dominate r/politics. It is sites like alternet and other fringe left sites that allow the right-wing mods to make false equivalents between left and right websites. There is nothing on the left that is equivalent of breitbart.com or Fox News. 




 Sorry for the sloppy phrasing. Jews were victims and the rich are trying to equate themselves with Jews even though there is not the slightest equivalence.

 The racists come out of the woodwork when Hitler is mentioned. 




 Because a math literate population is not needed in the computer age. 




 Why does it keep happening to Republicans. It is because they have no sensitivity about racial, gender, sexual preference and religious issues. These are not jokes, they never were jokes. These attacks are attempts to stereotype and demean other people. Until you understand this, it will continue to happen especially to Republicans and other like minded conservatives. 




 Far right Jews have used Nazi salutes against moderate Jewish leaders. However, the leaders faced with this provocation never mentioned Hitler. 




 This endless string of apologizes is getting tiresome. When photos like this are not floating around Republican circles they won't be posted.

 You don't have to make a separate database, just redact the fields that ID the cameras. This is done on many databases which are released that contain private information (i.e. SS numbers).

 After over 70 years secret from Nazi death camps are still being revealed. The question is why no one looked under the road for a gas chamber before now. 




 No for Calpers but for some of these hedge funds it may have some impact. 




 The history of the civil war is still being written 150 years after the guns stopped firing. 




 Banksters didn't stop committing crimes in 2008. 




 What jobs skills does a fast food worker gain that is transferable to another industry besides learning to come to work on time. 




 Maybe now banksters will go to jail for the financial crimes they commit. This may be wishful thinking but we have to hope. 




 All well and good if both sides have the money to get their message across. However, when those making false statements can outspend those with the truth by 10, 20 or a hundred times there is a need for the government to intervene. 




 I guess aerial combat missions are not a strategy. 




 These bombing are not the work of socialists but anarchists. 




 No, Exxon was just starting to work on a new oil field in partnership with a Russian energy company. 




 This is a great victory for historians who will have the ability to access  these documents.  




 Chomsky is trying to make headlines. There is no way he really believes this. He is using hyperbole to make a point. 




 Even a broken clock is right twice a day. 




 One case is not widespread fraud. Voter fraud is rare at best. There have been almost no cases of fraud involving same day registration even in states that allow registration on Election Day. 




 You can not be serious. If the UN is a terrorist organization then what is ISIS? 




 I don't remember a single case of fraud related to golden week. 




 This is a legitimate source please go there and look. It posts stories with permission from major news sources just like Yahoo news. 




 The story is from the AP. Do you have a problem with the source? 




 Would the GOP run this ad with a man in pants? NO. Republicans are clearly making an issue that the Congress member is a women.   




 I guess if you're part of the majority and don't care about minority rights there is nothing to worry about.

 Better known as collective punishment. 




 First you send the the country into the Great Recession. Then the government bails out your company so that it is now profitable. Finally you feel wronged and sue the government for $25 billion. That is a new level of crass capitalism. Greenberg should have been jailed with all the other banksters. 




 And to show their appreciation for this sweetheart deal the furniture company donated to Gov. Walker's re-election campaign. Keep moving nothing to see here. 




 Isn't it amazing how regulators allowed the utility to build in an active earthquake zone. 




 Remember Alabama's state slogan "At least we are not Mississippi." 




 The US constitution is not suspended for those who enter this country by extra-legal means. If that was true, we would have a two tiered legal system one for citizens and one for non-citizens. The injustice of such a setup would totally eviscerate the Constitutional protections for both groups. 




 I have to take issue with the word "going" in your headline.

 The blue wall was in place local before police forces were unionized. Don't take due process as the reason the police are not held to account for their actions. That is a failure on the part of police leadership. 




 I don't think police unionization has anything to do with the militarization of the police agencies. Police forces added all these "toys" because they were free or had a minimal cost.

Unions have helped police forces not to use arbitrarily actions to remove officers who do not believe in the consensus opinion of their bosses. Unionization has helped keep dissenting voices on the force. 




 Brilliance is not a hallmark of bank robbers. 




 I think austerity during a recession or debt crisis tends to have some minimal effect in the short term but bring about larger problems long term. 




 Our economy is way larger than Spain's. So it is a big deal. 




 The Libertarian answer: lower taxes and lower spending has been a long-term failure in most western countries that have tried it. The answer for Spain's economy is not to strangle it. 




 It is always amazing to see hidden stories get rediscovered. WWI was 100 years ago and we still are discovering new stories. 




 The situation in Ferguson is getting out of hand. The local police are no longer in control. It looks like St. Louis County police are now in charge and they have a much different attitude than the locals.

 The Ebola outbreak is not just getting out of control.It has been out of control for months in parts of Africa. What you seem to be saying it has begun to spread from Africa to the rest of the world.

 They must consider Ghandi's political activities as a coup. 

The reality is between 1901 and 1960 is the era of national liberation. That is the period in which former colonial nations sought independence from there colonizers. To use this era as a baseline to compare with later eras is a false comparison.

 The only way to build a third or fourth party is not to abandon the two parties but to build local party organizations and work our way up.

 The release of 19 boxes of KGB documents is a major contribution to the history of Russian intelligence in the last years of the Soviet Union.

 Having lived in NY, I feel no safer knowing that police officers are using illegal chokeholds to subdue suspects.

 From Wikipedia about Byrd's record after his vote on the 1964 Civil Rights Act:

For the 20032004 session, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)[62] rated Byrd's voting record as being 100 percent in line with the NAACP's position on the 33 Senate bills they evaluated. 16 other senators received that rating. In June 2005, Byrd proposed an additional $10 million in federal funding for the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial in Washington, D.C., remarking that, "With the passage of time, we have come to learn that his Dream was the American Dream, and few ever expressed it more eloquently."
 




 The difference is that Robert Byrd renounced his KKK past and became an advocate for civil rights.

 Failing to file court records is not an everyday occurrence. Why were papers not filed? Has there been any punishment for the person or persons who made the error? Have there been other instances of failing to file paperwork with the court? Who was in charge of the investigation?

 Five finger discount. The real question is why isn't this process computerized. To some this is exactly the reason not to computerize these records. 




 If you listen to BP the Gulf has been cleaned and they are the saviors of the environment.

 The government isn't allowed to ask for larger fines when the oil industry is reaping windfall profits. In this case some of the excess profits were the result of the disaster BP caused. 




 Many of those who came before the current immigrants snuck under fences, used false documents, extended their stays indefinitely and were not recognized as illegals. However when their skin is brown it is easier to equate the new immigrants as being other and not no one of us. 




 That will benefit a non-first world country. 




 Sending a private army to Iraq is more than providing military advisers. Supplying a proxy army is just providing US boots on the ground without military uniforms.

 The psychedelic state induced by ayahuasca modulates the activity and connectivity of the default mode network.

The experiences induced by psychedelics share a wide variety of subjective features, related to the complex changes in perception and cognition induced by this class of drugs. A remarkable increase in introspection is at the core of these altered states of consciousness. Self-oriented mental activity has been consistently linked to the Default Mode Network (DMN), a set of brain regions more active during rest than during the execution of a goal-directed task. Here we used fMRI technique to inspect the DMN during the psychedelic state induced by Ayahuasca in ten experienced subjects. Ayahuasca is a potion traditionally used by Amazonian Amerindians composed by a mixture of compounds that increase monoaminergic transmission. In particular, we examined whether Ayahuasca changes the activity and connectivity of the DMN and the connection between the DMN and the task-positive network (TPN). Ayahuasca caused a significant decrease in activity through most parts of the DMN, including its most consistent hubs: the Posterior Cingulate Cortex (PCC)/Precuneus and the medial Prefrontal Cortex (mPFC). Functional connectivity within the PCC/Precuneus decreased after Ayahuasca intake. No significant change was observed in the DMN-TPN orthogonality. Altogether, our results support the notion that the altered state of consciousness induced by Ayahuasca, like those induced by psilocybin (another serotonergic psychedelic), meditation and sleep, is linked to the modulation of the activity and the connectivity of the DMN.
