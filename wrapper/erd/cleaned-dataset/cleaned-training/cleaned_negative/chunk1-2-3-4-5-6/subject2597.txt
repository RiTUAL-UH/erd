 https://www.snapchat.com/geofilters/tips.html

The link guides you through how to make a geofilter for snapchat. Boulder has one (I'm not a fan of it),  but CU does not have one. While some off you don't use snapchat, some of you enjoy graphic design. Depending on how many people submit something, I may give out reddit gifts/gold. 
Ideas you may consider- notable buildings, Ralphie, the Flatirons, scenic area, or any design you can come up with.  








































































































 I know Eldora's terrain park is nothing  to brag about, especially compared to other Colorado resorts. Can anyone who's gone recently give me an idea of what to expect when I go later this week? I usually stick to medium sized features so hopefully a good amount of those.

 What needs to fall into place, what games do you need to win, what miracles must occur?  



















 Regardless of actual snowfall, which cities complain the most about snow?  
























 Looking for opinions. I personally think Keystone and A Basin are good for days without snow. Everyone has their spots at certain areas  




 Title says it all. Would be cool to see how much money programs get from their conference and how much comes from big games like this  




 I'm in arts and sciences (iphy) and want to take a basic marketing and maybe a management course. I have an opportunity to work in pharmaceutical sales for a bit after school before graduate school. I looked at theses course and they all are restricted to business schools students or have bcor prerequisites. Does anyone know of any that an A and S student can take? I'm a senior so I meet house requirements as well  









 Last final is Wed, that means Thursday is ski day. I can go to eldora, Winter Park, and the epic local areas. Who wants to go?  




 For Colorado, Ski Booker. Shooting 37% with 2.3 turnovers a game. He has 99 FGA, the next highest on the team is Scott with 67 FGA. The only think Booker contributes is steals and assist. 

edit- now he goes 7/14 for 20pts today. of course.  









 Went to doc two months ago after sleeping 8 hours in 3 days. He gave me 5mg ambien. Worked well as a half dose, some nights I needed the full 5mg. Just started my 3rd bottle, fell asleep at 5am, 5 hours after taking it. Sleept til 11am. 
Then this time I took full 5mg at 12 am, a half at 1am, and at 2 am. It's now 6am and I feel tired but awake  














 Oregon wins and they are in the playoffs, Arizona wins, they are in and Oregon is out (unless all other top teams lose). Who do you think should represent the pac in playoffs and why?  




 Going to eldora friday (opening  day). Looking for people to ski with this year if anyone wants to go. I'm into all aspects of skiing, have an eldora, epic local, and winter Park pass  




 I want a small plant for my desk that can handle low sunlight  light and dry air. What do you have? 









 First game thread so bear with me.
Looks like tip off may be delayed due to SMU/Gonzaga. I'll be ducking out of here after the first half since I still have early morning midterms so if any streams or other edits come available please comment them.

 Following 3 straight NCAA tournament appearances, you're Colorado Buffaloes take on Drexel in the first game of the year. Game is Friday at 6pm in Boulder. Stubhub tickets are selling for $6. 
Colorado is ranked in the top 30 nationally, predicted 6 seed for the NCAA tournament. 




 I recently found out Eldora used to have night skiing but haven't seen anything on why they no longer offer it. Below is a night trail map. I'm guessing it had to do with forest service, night traffic on the canyon, or not being profitable. I've night skied at Keystone and it was empty but  I figure night skiing would do better at Eldora since it's so close to Boulder. 


http://www.coloradoskihistory.com/images/eldora_overview_1.jpg

 









 Title says it all. Yes it is more basketball relevant but we're at the time where  other sports overlap. I wanted to post here to keep things a bit civil versus r/cfb and r/collegebasketball people yelling at Eachother. 

Has the UNC scandal changed your view on players receiving payment?

Personally I would be for taking for away scholarships and paying players under $100k. I'm not in favor of more successful schools getting to pay more money, then they just keep buying more talent and competition is gone.  









 I just signed up for skicarpool.org and it's pretty active, is anyone signed up with something  better? I'm looking to help people carpool, everyone knows i70 could use a break  









 Since Colorado and Wazzu are the bottom two but unfortunately don't play each other, I'd like to open up a discussion of predictions if they did. 

Colorado- 0-6 (2-7)
key games- overtime loss to Cal and UCLA 

Wazzu- 1-5 (2-7)
key games- win at Utah, close games against Oregon and Cal

Edit- pretend Halliday is playing  




 Got my first eldora pass (college discounted) and have never been. I'm looking at driving up for opening weekend, is it worth it? I've done A-Basin when they have just a few runs open and enjoy it but don't find it to be worth the drive since you spend so much time in line. 
Also, anyone that wants someone to ski with, I'm in Boulder with epic local and eldora passes  



















 Looking at getting an eldora pass to go along with my epic local. I didnt get much time to drive i70 last year and want to get more days in so eldora is a huge appeal. It's $179 for the season pass, prices go up to $229 on Nov 4. 

I don't know anyone who goes to eldora, anyone looking for someone to ski with? 

Also anyone with epic local.

Site crashed for a bit this morning, Arizona is almost sold out. Get tickets now! 




 http://espn.go.com/college-football/statistics
 


































 I will have the epic local college pass but because of my schedule I won't get out to summit as often as I'd like (enough for the pass to be worth the money). I'm also considering the Elodora college pass ($159) since it's closer to Boulder. 

 I've never been to Eldora and know it's smaller but the bus from Boulder is a great appeal. I saw it's added to the WP/Copper pass which will add to the crowds. 

Would it be worth getting the pass for days that I can't make it to summit? Is the terrain/snow as bad as they say?  














 I searched the sub to see if its been asked and I didnt see anything so I will be another EMT B student asking a question. 

Is it worth keeping your class books after completion and passing the registry exam for review or reference?  









 I'm currently an under grad finishing General Chemistry 2. I will be taking Organic 1 in the spring. I have looked around at general prerequisites for school and found a wide range from only general chemistry, to requiring biochemistry (some survey some full). Which level chemistry did you finish with and how limiting/excess was it when applying to programs? 



















 Will take as low as $40 credit 




 I have a camera but it can't do night scenes very well. 
I would love a picture of the flagstaff star with Venus (which is very bright the next few days) and maybe even the moon in the shot. 
I'm sure any photographers reading this may think it could make a great shot. Maybe with CU or any other boulder landmarks as well. 
Anyone willing to take the shot and post it? 




 I'm sure you get a lot of these questions but I'm looking for a good study guide for the EMT-B exam. I won't be taking it until this summer but there are way too many options to choose from.  




 just what title says, thanks  




 For any of those who have their name on their job shirts, do you use full name, first name last initial, or first initial last name? The latter seems more professional but patients would typically call you by first name which is easier to remember if it's right on your shirt. 




 tapped out started crashing for me a few hours ago. After I tap the continue page it will load for 5-10 sec then crash. I have tried reinstalling the app and turning my phone off/on. Anyone else experiencing this?
Iphone 5/ios 7 




 I have a pair of 2012/13 liberty helixes. I bought them used and they had a demo binding on them (removed before I bought them). I was able to center mount them and rode them 3x before season end. I am considering remounting them to cab forward. I had salomon suspects for 5 years before this pair and had those center mounted as well. On the helix i was having difficulty staying afloat in the powder and initiating turns on groomers. I'm not sure if this is from not being used to the ski or if i should move my binding to cab forward. 
so should i try moving them knowing that once i do they are stuck there for good, and how should they hold up with 3 binding mounts done?

i tried finding a ski gear subreddit and the best was wintergear with no activity, if this should be in a different subreddit i will happily move it. 




 Season 8 ep 1. Quinn says Barney wants to ride down the isle on a bear. The ring bear? 
Caught my attention while watching today  




 I'm sure most of you are familiar with the Gilbert white memorial flood maker next to Boulder Creek at Broadway. I have been searching for good pictures of the marker with the flood waters, kind of like a snow stick at ski resorts. I have only found pictures with the marker when flood waters have receded. Does anyone know of any good ones?  




 I wish i was good with graphics but Im not. I would love to see something like this with the events of the boulder flood, maybe even extended the whole front range.  




 is there a way to change the default view back to month instead of week? 
also, i find it annoying how "zoomed in" the times are, only showing a few hours before you need to scroll.  














 not seeing the game thread and cant find a steam,
any help? 




 last year vail gave a college discount on the epic local bringing it down to ~$350. Does anyone (especially someone on the inside) know if this will happen again this year?  




 And the control center didn't with me a happy birthday....

 I know this girl personally and her charity has really taken off recently. I know she would love some more support. Here is the description written by her--

Hi! My name is Emma Rose. I am a 17 year old Leukemia (ALL) patient. I was diagnosed with cancer in January, 2012. It has been a tough year, but I am finally feeling better. I am in the maintenance phase of my treatment. Even though this is the "easiest" part of my treatment, it still consists of daily oral chemo and almost monthly spinal taps until May 2014. Since my diagnosis, so many people have helped my family and me in many ways. Now, I want to do something to give back. I want to help other kids with cancer who are also being treated at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin.  We collect comfort items the kids can use during their stay- especially pillow pets, soft blankets, fuzzy socks, iTune gift cards, ear buds, packs of gum, leggo kits, nail polish, glow sticks, and crayons. Our newest Wishlists are on Amazon. If interested in donating gifts to help the Kids at Children's WI, please go to Amazon, click on Wish Lists and then search for Emma Rose. We just completed a major donation drive called "Movie Night". Thanks to the generosity of our followers and WE Energies' donation of 100 copies of Honor Flight- The Movie, we were able to put together 100 movie tubs for the kids. Each tub contained several movies, popcorn, candy and other items for the children and their families. The tubs were given to the children on the HOT Unit, in MACC Clinic, in the BMT Clinic and at Ronald McDonald House. Since the children cannot go to the movie theater, I wanted to bring the movie theater experience to them. Thank you so much! Please make sure all donations are new and in their original packages. All mail and packages can be sent to Emma Rose, PO Box 485, Thiensville, WI 53092. Thank you so much for your generosity!  Emma Rose 




 r/snowboarding is legit, /r/skiing doesnt have enough park, lets get it 









 rewatch the first episode. Its even better with the knowledge after watching all other episodes. pick up things you missed, and find things more humorous  





























 I saw in a thread someone commenting that they thought every character would meet the mother before Ted. Well, they were right according to the CBS president. They all meet her at the wedding before Ted and he only meets her after a big chunk of the season is done. I believe they said before that he meets her on the train returning from the wedding 





























 Now I already expect to get down votes shoved up my ass for this thread but I dont care because my life doesnt revolve around reddit karma. 
Before you downvote and click back without reading, read a bit of this. 
Why do people hate the Miami Heat? The answer- they all jumped on the hate train. 
1. Heat fans are bandwagon fans. Id like to argue that its cooler to hate the heat than like them. So by hating, you joined that band wagon. I became a Heat fan when they drafted Wade. I watched Wade a season ticket holder for Marquette. I never cared for the bucks because they never caught my interest. You dont have to be a fan of your local team, everyone has their reasons for liking a team. I was a fan before Lebron and the Big 3 yet everyone assumes Im a fan because of Lebron. Wade won Miami's first title in 2006.
Before someone says "Jimmy Butler played for Marq, shouldnt you be a bulls fan? No. While I love to see how well he is doing, Wade is still my favorite Marq player. Not just because of skill, but how he is off the court. Read up on his divorce and life with his sons.

2. "Lebron is a traitor/sellout"- Cleveland didnt have a chance of a title in the near future so Lebron went somewhere he could win. So what? Every player in the NBA wants to win a title. Its a lifelong dream for professional athletes. If your a Cleveland fan who hates lebron, you should be hating the management for not building a better team before lebron left. I dont mean a team around lebron or a superstar team, just a better team. 

3. The heat are a superstar team. So what? Part of basketball is trying to build a great team that will build a franchise. When you play pick up games you choose the best players first dont you? Do you all hate the Jordan era bulls? 

4. Bosh is a dinosaur. I dont mind people saying this. Its true and the memes are funny. Thats no reason to hate a player though. There are plenty of uglier players. 

5. Lebron is compared to Jordan. Thats the standerd for basketball, everyone is looking for the next jordan. Lebron has MVPs and Olympic Medals. He doesnt have the rings but look at his past. Cleveland had no chance. He made the finals his first year with the heat, won the finals the second year, had a 27 game winning streak the 3rd year. He is a damn good player. He is not Jordan. Having him compared to jordan is not a reason to hate him. NBA analyst will always compare great players to Jordan. Kobe gets compared. I dont hate Kobe for that or for being a great player. I dislike him because he has a record for being a selfish asshole who was accused of rape.... (Tosh.0 anyone?)

I'm not saying theres no reason to hate the Heat. Im just saying you should have your reasons and be able to back them up. My reasons listed arent perfect but they are a start. There are reasons to hate Miami, but be able to back yourself up so you arent just another person riding the hate train. 
 
























 What if Rose has not returned because the NBA secretly made him wait until the Bulls v Heat series.
Im not saying this is true or possible, just a thought that sort of fits. 
1. Heat beat bulls for a couple games, but not by a lot. 
2. Rose returns in game 3 or 4
3. Refs influence game or everything just seems to go against Miami
4. Rose and the Bulls take the next games needed to win the series
5. Bulls Heat rivalry heats up
6. Lebron leaves Miami 
7.
8. 
9. NBA Profit?? $$$ 
























 Be great if someone could turn the hand into a downvote

 Anyone have any links for streaming CU vs Oregon St? No one has the pac 12 network 


































 As seen in the [Construction cam] (http://www.cubuffs.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=209458799) the beams are going up. The first beam was erected a couple weeks ago. The height looks odd because a good amount of the facility is underground from the camera angle. The facility is 80ft tall with a full sized track surrounding the football field.   









 Specifically referring to Bernie Sanders plan  



















 I had been using protein shake mixes for years on and off without much gaining. It finally hit me one day that I wouldn't eat for hours after having a shake, they made me feel too full and slightly nauseous. I instead started using preworkout and creatine only, I had used them with shakes beforehand. I drink 3-4 glasses of chocolate milk each day, two immediately after a workout. I noticed I was eating more and now have gained  20 lbs since giving up protein shakes a few months ago. I'm not sure why I'm posting this except to tell anyone who gets irritation from shakes to try something else. There's no universal meal plan for gainers, just meet you calorie goal and eat "healthy" foods.

 The rules- you can only be a fan if: 
You attended/plan to attend the school 
An immediate family member attended the school
Or you live within 150 miles of the school. 

Which school are you a fan of and why? 
Also, does this differ from your flair?  









 I know nothing about the process of adding intramural sports but is anyone interested in intramural lacrosse? I'm guessing the only way to make it happen would be playing no-contact or possibly using women's sticks and rules. Liability comes with physicality. The school has the lacrosse field and goals. Participants would likely need their own equipment. The only real cost to the school would be more refs. 
If anyone knows more about the process or works with the rec center it would be great to get the ball rolling. Lacrosse is the fastest growing sport and Colorado could become the lacrosse capital of the West since the outlaws professional team is good and DU won nationals.  




 I'm thinking 6-7, sweep OOC and manage two pac wins including one big upset at home. Manage to get a bowl game through the weird Hawaii rule

Construction of a 120,000-square-foot indoor multipurpose practice facility on top of Franklin Field, to include a 100-yard artificial turf football field and six-lane 300-meter track;
Refurbishment of the Dal Ward Athletics Center, completed in 1991, to include an Olympic sports strength training room in the sub-basement level and new locker rooms and equipment room on the field level;
Redesigning of Dal Ward's first floor for the expansion of Olympic sports/sports medicine, a leadership development center and an end zone club with club seating and loge boxes;
Transforming the second floor of Dal Ward to triple the athletic department's academic support system from its current 5,000 square feet to 15,000 square feet;
Building additional restrooms and concession areas on the east side of Folsom Field; and
Adding a 21,900-square foot high-performance sports center on the northeast corner of the stadium, as well as a rooftop terrace on the northeast corner, converting the south offices at Folsom Field to retail space. The rooftop terrace will generate revenue by being available for rent for non-game-day events. The high-performance sports center will host collaborative research conducted by CU-Boulder Integrative Physiology faculty and researchers at the CU Anschutz Medical Campus.

 CU is hosting its first field day tomorrow. Students can play yard games or compete against football players in skills stations such as throwing, kicking, catching, 40 yard dash etc. As a student I'm looking forward to it and was wondering if other schools do this. Specifically with CU, its a great way for the program to branch out to the students who have formed some hostility for the program.

I cannot do both because of when classes are available and I am graduating in the fall. I want to get a job in health administration and possibly continue on to graduate school for a MHA. Which path above should I take? My major is in physiology which isn't direclty applicable  to Health administration but I do know some people who landed jobs with similar majors.  





























 Last year I took classes both summer terms so I still had my rec center membership. This year I'm doing the July term only. Do I get a membership for just July or the whole summer?

 A lot of people are staying in Boulder for break. I'm hoping to ski, bike, or hike (possibly camp) every day. I'm hoping to get people together to enjoy the great backyard we have in Boulder.  





























 So we should lower taxes so people have more spending money?  




 No skiing?  









 Just started Division 3 and the opening scene is [this view] (https://localtvkdvr.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/750px-folsom_field.jpg) 




 That was a fumble-6, not an incompletion 
 




 Insert weed joke here  




 I'm watching high school boys intently on Twitter  




 Something something Ralphie something fifth down  




 You know it'll be Kodak or Walmart  




 I have [EPS] (http://youtu.be/tbKOEJIcIKI) 




 Full time college student here, I just work weekends  




 My class actually mentioned those ports and how to handle them in that situation  




 What does it say about U of A when Colorado goes to 2OT against a team that Arizona only beat with a hail mary? 




 [Following the Boulder flood] (https://vimeo.com/77180229). It's not an adrenaline hype video, but pretty damn motivational 




 The double OT game against Cal stands out. I had about 5 heart attacks during it. 
[Highlights start 25 seconds in] (http://youtu.be/J_vsfhQHpSU) 




 2008 called, they want their Obama poster back  




 Most of Colorado already does this. Still use plastic  




 I'll give the CSU section a [nice wink] (https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/5c/3e/54/5c3e5469c8349025937ef47b30812ac1.gif) at the RMS  




 In the name of harbaugh, the M, and fucking Ohio State amen.  




 Well this is the first CSU post I did. 
Second, get the fuck off of Ralphie! 




 Trying to find them is God awful  




 Well there goes my summer  




 Winter snow accumulation? Well you've never been to Boulder. It snows one day and is gone the next. Unless it's been cold for days before snowing then the snow will just melt right off the panels on contact  




 Above average. It's enough that 20lbs isn't noticeable, or 50 in your case  














 Water level should be low enough by then  




 Go up flagstaff or sanitas and watch the Folsom field fireworks and the many others over the skyline  




 I'm sure there are, I just listed the ones I knew without searching. I was hoping people would post suggestion to make the last 70 days of off season go by  




 It's early but Paul Richardson (Seahawks) tore his ACL in his rookie season and missed the superbowl. He's come back in the past, hoping he can do it again  




 Pretty sure November 2011 is Sandusky  




 Did a quick search and it looks like a list hasn't been done in awhile, so let this be a list of cfb movies/documentaries on Netflix or online free sites. 

Off the top of my head-

Happy Valley 
30:30 the U
Rudy  




 Wisconsi, not sure if it counts since it's my flair  




 I think they should have a field day once it's done, let people come check it out and throw a ball around.  




 It's definitely enough for lighting, like you said climate control would  be the issue. However  it's cool enough sept through bowl season to not need cooling. I'd imagine they have some very efficient insulation as well. 
I believe I saw somewhere that the facility would also use a feedback loop for climate control, possibly with Folsom field. I've having issues finding it 
Edit- [here's the same company working on making levi stadium net zero] (https://joinmosaic.com/blog/levis-49er-stadium-leads-net-zero-energy-race/) 




 Sure looked like panels when I walked past.  




 The burp girl 
 




 "indoor practice facility is partnering with SunPower to install a 55,000 square foot solar panel array that will generate 850kW of electricity.  Almost half of the roof will be covered with solar panels allowing it to be a net-zero electricity facility, meaning it creates more energy than it consumes. There will even be a live dashboard that will display how much energy is being produced, and other information about the panels on the roof mounted in the facility."
[source](http://bsndenver.com/what-you-didnt-know-about-the-new-cu-facilities-part-1/). 
The climate control will be by evaportive coolers. These use 1/8th the power of air conditioning. They can be used in Boulder because of the area's low humidity. 

Edit- apparently there's a neighborhood in Boulder that is zero energy, from 2009
http://www.dailycamera.com/ci_13878645 




 You forgot [this girl] (http://i.imgur.com/SE2KeCb.gif) 




 I think redoing the west side is in discussion. They mentioned tearing down Balch Field house. I really hope they manage to keep the field house but I guess they won't need it if they can put a floor down in the practice facility for non-football events. Expanding the concourse on coors has also been in discussion, I don't see how they do that with the little room to expand outside.  




 And burn away the shame of another loss  




 How about free weed?  




 I thought I would try writing my own type of construction update as I pass by the facilities daily. 

Construction updates are all over /r/cfb so what makes this one unique? Green innovation. 
The solar panels on the indoor practice facility have started being placed. The skeleton of the structure is viewable on the [construction cam] (http://www.cubuffs.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=209458799). So why do solar panels matter? They matter because the [indoor practice facility](http://www.cusustainableexcellence.com/ipf.html), 110,000 square feet, will be the only self-sustaining indoor practice facility in the country. 

This isn't the first CU athletic facility to lead the nation in a green initiative, Folsom Field became the [first zero waste stadium in 2008] (http://www.colorado.edu/ecenter/zero-waste-football-games). This is all part of [Ralphie's Green Stampede] (http://www.cubuffs.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=1549812) that consists of many eco-friendly initiatives to keep CU as one of the greenest and most innovative universities. 

The setting of CU on the edge of the Rocky Mountains is a constant reminder of why CU leads the way in building a more sustainable future.  The new facilities will also lead Colorado football into a brighter future, with sustained success to rival that of the 90's. After all, if you build it, they will come. Well, 3 people are coming so far....  




 Bless your heart  




 Seems like a lot of reps/sets. I'd suggest knocking off some of the high reps sets  




 Any suggestions for protein that's easy on the stomach? 




 I would rethink the reps. I do 5x5 and my weights go up 5lbs a week for bench and squat. I study exercise science and high weight with few reps will get your max strength higher while lower weight at high reps is more endurance. Its fast twitch vs slow twitch muscle fibers if your interested in checking it out  




 You don't look much bigger, part of being tall, but your shape has definitely improved. More of a chest and less of a gut. Size will come 




 Because you don't have birds chirping. Call me crazy but I hate birds, mostly because they have a nest outside my window so they wake me up at dawn  




 Hopefully in the next renovation... 




 Troughs. Sorry  




 We tried this last year, didn't help  




 Plus it can get below freezing in the mountains that time of year  




 Free tickets with purchase from dispensary  




 Just need California to legalize and over half the pac would be legal. 

Pac 12- conference of pothead champions  




 [moose] (http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_28359296/moose-loose-boulder-police-scare-late-night-visitor)

Edit- apparently [this video] (https://m.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/3amojj/house_cat_doesnt_give_a_shit_about_mountain_lion/)of a mountain lion and cat happened just outside of boulder  




 Give out weed? Have a weed garden? 
Honestly it's hard to get fans to show when you're surrounded by the rocky Mountains. Having night games would help  




 But........we have weed  




 TIL how it was made. 
It would be very odd if a candidate didn't use red white and blue. Obama's campaign stood out because he was a younger guy with great marketing  




 I was referring more to the red white and blue self portraits, the hope and change. Obama's campaign was extremely visual  




 So the conservative version of  think progress? 




 Obama knew this 
Edit- referring to the red white and blue street art posters  




 Home life does more to education than education itself  




 Poor poor liberal victim. Here have some hope and change.  




 But why male models? 
Ben stiller forgot the line and was restarting the scene. It worked well  




 Leaving the hospital with the failed explosion  




 Obesity has a very simple fix, put down the fork. 
However people with obesity have reasons for over eating usually associated with lack of discipline/confidence so food because emotional support  




 Ah memories. I made it to every pearl st bar that night, with a drink at each, after starting at half fast. 

If CU starts out 5-0 with a win against Oregon, pearl st will have a real stampede  




 It's simple, we kill the batman. 

But seriously you have to find the root cause, no its  not movies or video games, and fix that. I don't know enough to know that cause  




 http://www.amazon.com/MANGROOMER-Flushable-Personal-Engineered-Executive/dp/B0090N3SKM 




 As someone in Colorado, weed.  




 That's a day's worth of food for me 




 Only half price for the first 12 months. Can't reuse edu emails either  




 I saw that shower thought too 




 Apparently they don't include new jerseys  




 Camo can be bought at many places  




 [Ironically he writes gang rape erotica] (http://nypost.com/2015/06/05/bernie-sanders-rape-fantasy-essay-reveals-left-wing-hypocrisy/)

I don't think the erotica represents his personal views, but it's kinda ironic  




 It's as if Huffington post twisted his words!

"The placement of a Confederate flag on the Capitol grounds is a state issue and I fully expect the leaders of South Carolina to debate this but the conversation should wait until after the families have had a chance to bury and mourn their loved ones," Walker said in a statement to BuzzFeed last week. 
 




 If you actually read the misleading article, he said he trust South Carolina to handle it, he never said he was for the flag.  




 [Just like Clinton] (http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/17/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-change-position-same-sex-marriage/) 




 Very misleading title. He never said he supports it. He called for it to be taken down years ago, then recently said he trusts South Carolina will handle it. 

"The placement of a Confederate flag on the Capitol grounds is a state issue and I fully expect the leaders of South Carolina to debate this but the conversation should wait until after the families have had a chance to bury and mourn their loved ones," Walker said in a statement to BuzzFeed last week. 
 




 Fixing our violent culture would decrease gun deaths, stabbing, assualts, and any other way you harm someone  









 Like when you want to return an item to Amazon but they refund you and say don't bother returning it. How do they do that? Amazing  




 Being a liberal doesn't make you a hippie, but being a hippie makes it near certain you're a liberal. Close enough?  




 Except I can leave my house and comeback with a replacement phone 30min later. Other companies require you send it in  




 That customer service though  




 1% of the world consumes 99% of the world's food  




 And the majority of preventable illnesses are obesity related. The same conditions are the top costs in healthcare.  




 Except they have a bowl already 




 I mean, they worked. 
If they actually got made into swim trunks I'd buy a pair  




 Toss up between the new uniforms and new facilities  




 Our pac bro will beat you and we're going to beat you next year with another miracle in Michigan  




 11am- wake up still hungover from watching the game at 11pm mountain against Hawaii the Thursday before. 

1130am start watching whatever games are on. 

9pm go to the bars. 

1159pm get a drink thrown in my face  




 Were spending record amounts of money per student and getting poor results. Money isn't the problem. It's students who don't care because of shitty home lives, teachers (some not all) that get lazy after getting tenure.  




 NRA fights that data collection because the data will show how much shootings occur. However that data won't show the reason behind it. The reason being the US is a violent country. Guns aren't the problem, society is.  




 [were just a violent country] (http://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2012/07/20/america-is-a-violent-country/). Fix the violence, and gun deaths will go down. If you think violence will decrease without guns you are mistaken. The US still has an above average rate of stabbing and bare hand assualts when compared to other countries  









 I'm interested in how that would work. Do you have more info? 

Edit- downvoted for being interested and wanting to learn something, never change /r/politics  









 I don't understand what you're getting at  




 Jeb Bush actually took down the flag in Florida back in 2000.  




 Changing US culture to not be as violent would be better than gun control. Most other first world countries aren't near as violent at the US.

 All 4 of those electoral votes from a state that is basically Vermont.  




 Free college and health care wasn't delusional enough? 
Bring on the downvotes.  




 If only he had his own campaign subreddit. Oh wait... 




 That requires people actually watch it 




 Like the undecided voters in Family Guy  




 It would get upvoted if Trump said it because reddit loves to laugh at him  




 Genetic conditions are one thing... 




 1,000 years from now historians can just look at videos of the past, assuming they don't fuck up and lose the ancient technology of mp4 etc 




 I would like to reinforce that it's the insurance companies that screw up costs, not the hospital or clinic. The purpose of insurance is to collect as much money while paying out as little as possible. The hospital will charge $100 for an advil pill but will only get $10. That's why bills are so high, it's a negotiation game.  




 The person pays more, but the hospital gets paid less. They hospital charges an uninsured person less than an insured person because they can actually get money from the insured. 
The ambulance service I works for only sees payment on 30% of patients. That means 70% of our patient won't pay a cent, including their insurance or lack of.  




 [Well 21% of the health costs could be fixed if people ate better and exercised] (http://news.cornell.edu/stories/2012/04/obesity-accounts-21-percent-medical-care-costs).
It's no coincidence that the most obese country pays the most for healthcare.  




 My university had experiments on board. Good thing we still have another one orbiting Mars  




 I think you left out the part about cars  




 I reported another post for the same violation and the mod claimed the source post wouldn't load for him. It was the official Sanders web page.  




 That was my thought. If by some tiny chance the guy recognized his own car then mission accomplished 




 Does this count as a witch hunt? 
Obviously not in favor of littering but reddit rules are rules  




 [Well this is awkward] (http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/26/rand-paul-gets-highest-marks-marijuana-policy-proj/) 




 Title rule violation, mods either need to enforce the rule or get rid of it instead of being selective based on their opinion  




 Only if lanes are clear on the sides. Good luck doing that in a traffic jam  




 Well there would be a car blocking the way... 




 Colorado Springs University  




 /r/tall 




 Fixed 




 You brought up football. 

Colorado had one bad year after getting snubbed one year, making the tournament the next 3, including a pac 12 tournament title.  




 Yeah it must be great critiquing others when your school has zero chance of ever making playoffs being in the MWC and all. Especially when you go 1-7 in conference.

4th recruit for CU so far

[247sports] (http://247sports.com/Recruitment/Akil-Jones-87153/RecruitInterests)

Other offers from Wyoming, Utah State, San Diego St 

 




 Well you used the old one in the post  




 Says the mountain west school. Talk to me when you have 30 national championships  




 Alien blue shows flair  




 Someone didn't hear about our [new unis] (http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5526826ee4b0788926c507cf/55443953e4b0e11ffa878af3/55538015e4b03971c5bae4b2/1431535638051/2.jpg) 




 Because Colorado plays at Hawaii they are bowl eligible at 6-7. There's a couple other things that would have to fall in place but odds would be favorable for Colorado. Plus Colorado SOS is crazy  




 Like all $10-$20 of tax payer money? You should she the shit that goes on in Washington  




 Imagine how different this would be if she was shot  




 A popular phrase used to show disapproval of the current US president, specifically used here about the Infringement of constitutional rights by some states  




 Thanks Obama!
 (yes I know he had nothing to do with it) 




 I'll look out for that, my browser defaults to https  




 Unless the people change to a "bad" view. 
Like hypothetically people decided they were against gay marriage and then Obama tries to ban it. 
 




 Damn that post filter isn't catching much  




 Probably SNL Bush 




 But it also shows how the politician can be swayed  




 I'm not Republican  




 Also a lot of social media and technology has changed in the last 7 years. Bush never had the chance to make a BuzzFeedVideo  




 It had a lot to do with voters supporting it 




 So that's the change he was talking about in his campaign.... 




 So mods, this violates the new title rules because it uses title AND quote. I guess it stays because Sanders, fuck off mods  














 4-0 OOC, beat Oregon, USC, UCLA. Win the bowl game. End season 8-6 




 The thousands of posts from people wanting to take advantage and get fake Internet points wasn't enough?  




 I'd say more important  




 Or hopping on the karma train  




 [he's an amazing writer too] (http://nytlive.nytimes.com/womenintheworld/2015/05/29/can-you-tell-if-these-passages-are-from-bernie-sanders-weird-1972-short-story-or-fifty-shades-of-grey/) 




 Right around the same time he wrote gang rape erotica 




 Or the right wall will be the inside wall of a circle  




 See the side bar 




 Well you got it, just keep in mind they close the roads for the fireworks so you'll have to hike  




 Freedomest?

Well the US didn't get any smarter  




 Take advantage of all the people rushing to get married = $$$$ 














 Roughly 15 lbs? About a pound a week for us Americans.  




 There's also stuff to open blood vessels and vitamin b. I use preworkout and lift noticeably better.  




 Fellow tall, I've put on 30lbs in 6 months. A good amount is fat but I was so skinny I didn't care. I'm not even skinny fat so the weight looks good. Just lift a lot and eat a lot, worry about muscle tone later unless you get a huge gut  




 What are you asking? 




 Brace yourselves for all the posts "X states their thoughts of the legalization".  




 And this will be the biggest post in reddit history  




 Sorry, my brain is filled with very small rocks  




 Braces yourselves for the biggest post in /r/politics history  




 Maybe wedding ceremony costs will increase initially due to demand? I'm just spit balling here 




 Can't we just celebrate this without talking politics? 




 Anything on if private places that host weddings are allowed to turn a gay couple down? That's the next big thing to tackle  




 I had no idea this was even going on in the court. That language is so official yet so moving  




 Says Walmart on the store  




 Man its sad no one on this sub cares. I'd say we should have /R/Wisconsinpolitics but politics makes the majority of content here. 
Let's go Decker and Frank!  




 They aren't air force  




 Fall of Colorado  




 North-Oregon,Stanford,Cal 

South- USC, Arizona, Utah 

Games circled- Oregon, Cal, USC  




 Air Force, Colorado, CSU, GT. 
You can't do that. The Colorado teams hare each other, GT hates CU  




 glad you guys could get over the clipping call, unlike someone.... 




 3 




 Utah. 
Ideal pac south would be Colorado, Utah, UCLA, ASU, USC, Arizona  




 Well an Arizona player is now playing with Dinwiddie in Detroit  




 [how dare you] (https://twitter.com/sportsnation/status/614232190189240324) 




 If Dinwiddie didn't get hurt, that year would have been awesome between Colorado and Arizona  




 I'm just coming from back in to talk about Stanley Johnson joining Dinwiddie in Detroit  




 I think the glory days are done already. Tad didn't take advantage of the success when it comes to recruiting. Probably barely .500 this season  




 [Just let me know how many times you hear his name] (http://youtube.com/watch?v=ZpAVEHHTz9s) 




 Yeah, Colorado doesn't even like him. But losing him isn't helping the team.  




 And cross country  









 Man you guys love to hate on him, you do realize no CU fans were happy he said that right? 
1/12 64-63 CU
3/12 53-51 CU wins pac tournament 
1/13 83-92 AZ in OT, you know damn well there wasn't enough evidence to overturn Chen's buzzer beater 
2/13 71-58 CU, RedemChen, the Valentines Day Massacre.  




 I used muscle milk a few years ago and stopped after a couple months. Too much sugar, it's basically an over marketed halfway decent protein  




 Football has shown more fight than basketball. I don't know how they show their faces after the game against Seattle. No excuse for losing that tournament  









 Are we a football school again?  




 How convenient it happened the year we don't go to the desert. Conspiracy theory- XJ didn't want to leave CU without a win at Arizona 

Plus Colorado died with Dinwiddie ACL  




 Well I believe he gets another year of eligibility, might be good in the long run since our recruiting sucks right now  









 Now put it in the oven and have apple chips  




 YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TIED UNC AND THEN WE WOULDN'T HAVE THIS DISCUSSION! IT'S YOUR OWN FAULT  




 How many Courics?  




 Well when you're high up you have potentially hundreds of people gunning for your job. Fuck up and they bring the next guy in.  




 Great example of why the schools don't need more money, they need to manage it better. My high school had less money than the area's public schools but students did better because of home life, discipline, and teachers that cared.  




 Well to be fair a big reason why inner city schools perform poorly is lack of discipline.  




 Well doctors already have performance checks, just in different ways. They retake the board exams every few years, those are fucking difficult. Doctors get sued and have lawyers evaluating everything looking for slip ups. If you fuck up, your patient gets worse or dies.  




 Those tangles  




 So this dude just runs out of a store with his arms full of crab legs while yelling fuck her right in the pussy and the woman working the store cries rape  




 I can neither confirm or deny buying beer for some of the linemen 




 6-7, then win the bowl game  




 Score on the first play of the 5th down series. Then GT would stop bitching even though the voters new all about the 5th down and chose Colorado anyways. They only won their poll by one troll vote 




 Or you know, a play that doesn't result in a tie for GT-UNC.  




 USC. It's a Friday night blackout game on ESPN.  




 YOU'RE JUST MAD WE LEFT  




 GAME THREADS AFTER DARK, COLORADO AT HAWAII 11PM MOUNTAIN  




 [can I get some of those recruits?] (http://cdn.meme.am/instances/58868050.jpg) 




 Biggest College stadium in a 500 mile radius, a live buffalo running around the field, you can legally get high before the game, the most scenic area in College football, and a [rooftop area] (http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wrk-ut5oUDc) WITH BEER overlooking the field with the Flatirons background

 AT LEAST THEY CAN'T BE CHARGED WITH POSSESION  




 He doesn't need help, it's Madison.  




 Can here we see competition doing its job in the market  




 Because they game is in Hawaii, and on a Thursday. So they have it when they finish class. It's stupid 




 IT'S ONLY 1030 HERE 




 This offer brought to you by New Belgium Stadium  




 Well CSU will have a shiny new stadium 




 First they confuse us, then they shall attack  




 Colorado beats Arizona at home  




 Nov 13 (USC) will be a long night if we win, guessing it'll be the blackout game since it's 7pm on ESPN  




 Let me know what you find, my interest has peaked  




 Well we could take a few billion from the defense budget.  




 Colorado  




 Cut the budget in available areas.  




 I'll have class the next day, but only one.... 




 According to a projection from the non-partisan Tax Policy Center, the top 1 percent of Americans will pay 45.7 percent of the individual income taxes in 2014up from 43 percent in 2013 and 40 percent in 2012 (the oldest period available).

http://www.cnbc.com/id/102581780 




 3) the game starts at 11pm Mountain

 But a handful of millionaires can provide the government with money to operate  
























 No, just pay more attention to who you vote for beyond the president.  




 You over estimate the influence the governor has on jobs  




 Or they could go to the Sanders subreddit  




 What if it brings the state government profit?  




 What if I told you the other 2/3 of government would still be corrupt?  




 Or people could vote for the person they want, you know, the way democracy is set up to work. If you don't vote because you don't think your person will win, you're a terrible American  




 They're so mature that they don't read beyond titles and circle jerk sanders  




 Where's your wife titsmcgeee?  




 One of the best convo breakers I've seen on reddit  




 They want schools with large research budgets so they can collaborate. Colorado has a study with Wisconsin on why kids are dropping out of STEM. I've seen many recent studies at Colorado with Stanford and USC  




 Understood and I frequent the new section. At the same time why are many posts needed about the same thing? It discourages any diversity. If people want to talk about sanders crowd on multiple posts then there can go to the Sanders subreddit  




 OK I change it, $30 if he wins, $10 if he loses  




 No we don't.  




 I'm speaking relative to Wisconsin. If there was as much liberal trend as people think, walker wouldn't have been voted in three times. This was held in Madison, one of the country's most liberal cities. Unless you lived under a rock you heard about the protests in Madison when walker broke up unions. Walker survived still. One city does not represent an entire state.  




 Milwaukee will never be conservative. Simply said, that's where liberal voters live  




 But he went to Denver instead of Boulder. CU'S arena fits 10,000 people, he should've gone there. I saw Obama speak there a few years ago  




 His plans are pretty general too. 




 So what? Why do you need more than one post saying he had a big crowd  




 It was coincidence that it's gameday countdown tweet today  




 [He won't win] (http://www.businessinsider.com/can-bernie-sanders-beat-hillary-clinton-2015-7).
Before I get downvoted to the depths of hell, who wants to place a wager? If Sanders wins the primary, I'll donate $25 (I'm a broke college student and Sanders likes small donations) to his campaign. If he doesn't make it, $25 will be donated to the GOP that wins the primary by whoever takes me up on this. 

Edit- wow I would've expected someone to take me up on this by now. I guess Sanders supporters aren't as confident as they appear  









 I'm already subscribed, but it goes by the name /r/politics  









 Calling on the mods to do some regulation. All the top posts are about the crowd. Do we really need that many posts to tell us sanders had a big crowd? It's spamming, it's karma whoring, it's unnecessary.  




 Keep in mind this state elected Walker twice and he survived a recall. This crowd doesn't mean much  




 The top 4 posts on the sub are the same exact thing, sanders got a big crowd. Do we really need that many posts? Quit spamming

 At 62-22 CSU will always be little bro  




 We have caves and mines. 




 They can have the Bomber Game. Air Force drops bombs, New Mexico is where bombs are set off  




 Well we have plenty of one popular plant. 
Also high altitude = better skiing. This season ran October to June  




 Attendance has been bad and Colorado needs more home games since some years they only have 4 home conference games.  




 That's the excuse. When CU was snubbed they lost in the semis of the NIT, then won the pac tournament the following year so they couldn't be snubbed again 




 Well the showdown is no longer. CSU won't agree to a 2-1 series and so CU has scheduled TCU, Nebraska, Texas A M  




 We have UW and WSU, Oregon and OSU, Arizona and ASU. There's a trend  




 The bitched about being left out and lost the first NIT round

 Pretty sure king of the mountain would consist of CU, CSU, Utah, Utah State, BYU, Wyoming

 Why do you care? You're moving to the G5 




 No. Utah St and Colorado St to big 12.  




 In some areas, I'm just surprised it wasn't mentioned as criteria  




 Nothing about academics? 
I think they were generous on basketball. CSU lost the best players from last year if I remember correctly and that year was an outlier. They complain about being snubbed and then lose in the first NIT round. That's just poor attitude. Colorado was snubbed a few years ago then  lost in the NIT semis. To prevent being snubbed they won the pac tournament the following year. 
Geography gave me a laugh. Yes Colorado boarders a big 12 state and used to be a big 12 state, but it's not any easy drive. It's 8 hours of boring flat land from Kansas. I think CU BIG 12 history is the only reason geography was scored so high.  




 Cu and CSU haven't been doing well with the neutral site series and it's ending in a few years, ending the rivalry

 You'd like Boulder. They're converting entire traffic lanes into bike lanes.

 I gained weight  




 At the bar a guy kept bumping into me pretty hard. I know accidental bumps happen in crowds but it was more than that. I tell him "hey can you try not to bump into me so much". There's a girl there he's hitting on that I never even looked at. He decides to get all tough with words and starting to shove. Looks over at his friend who then comes over. These guys are around 5' 10". I laugh and turn to my friends. 
6'3", 6'6", 6' 8". The 6'8" guy is easily 250lbs. The guy backed off when he realized who I was with.

 You'd think Colorado would be better with a coach and player on this team  




 I never heard about the tournament until this year, perhaps someone could explain it more. Colorado has an alumni team, games start July 10th and Colorado plays July 11th. Games are live streamed with the final 17 being shown on ESPN U, and the last 3 games on ESPN.
Colorado roster includes Beau Gamble, Jeremy Adams, Sabatino Chen, to name a few. 
Winning team gets $1,000,000 and registered fans get prizes ranging from a t-shirt to $5,000.

 They also had a winning record in a major city with a less active population  




 "In place of seven tax brackets, there would be one (with a generous standard deduction for the first $50,000 of income). In place of hundreds of credits, deductions and other loopholes, there would be only a handful."

 You under estimate the amount of people that go to the ER and don't pay. Plus, the majority of cases in the ER could be seen by primary care or urgent care instead

 It was, I helped others make the connection  




 Hawaii is a few hours behind and can't play the game until after class gets out  




 You may have missed what I was referring to. In the 4th CU recruit post a Nebraska site had listed CSU as being in the springs. So CSU is now Colorado Springs University  




 I don't think consent should be required if there is reason for search. Does a guy match the description of one from a theft? Search for the item. Random stop and search should be consent based but appropriate suspicion should be enough to base a search on.

 Colorado Springs University deserves a few votes since they also have Air Force Academy in town  




 Take 20% off of the per capita and it's only 1,000 more than Norway. That 20% doesn't include cardiovascular disease which can be attributed to lifestyle choices.

 Burners for the hoes 




 That is correct but we're comparing to more developed countries. Also the rate is increasing in the US and it's predicted that 3/4 of Americans will be overweight or obese in the next 5 years. Something so easily fixed by people fixing themselves has taken over the country.

 Colorado should have never joined the pac 12  




 Colorado basketball has a ridiculous home court advantage, likely because you don't have stops in play. 0.690 all time, 90% under coach Boyle  




 In our case, what are they doing Wed before the 11pm mountain time game Thursday?  




 Similar note I Think CU has the highest elevation of p5 teams at 5,360ft. Denver Broncos are highest in the NFL and where 2/3 longest field goals have occurred  









 Too much work, just like exercise  




 0-69 real quick

 And American men are sent to other sports like American football, basketball, and baseball.  




 Really depends on height also. I can gain 1 pound of muscle a week.

 Record bench of 250 after starting at 185 a few months ago. 
Record weight of 180. I never weighed more than 170 and was 155 back in March. 
Friends I hadn't seen in months noticed my bulk, talking to girls at the bar has never been easier  




 Unpopular thought here. When you're really skinny your BF is also low. Gain muscle and BF. Who cares if you have fat as long as it's not a gut? Cut when you get to a good size. I've gained half fat half muscle but I still look better and most importantly I'm stronger

[A 2001 study looked specifically at 34 adolescent mass murderers, all male. 70 percent were described as a loner. 61.5 percent had problems with substance abuse. 48 percent had preoccupations with weapons; 43.5 percent had been victims of bullying. Only 23 percent had a documented psychiatric history of any kindwhich means three out of four did not.] (http://www.psmag.com/health-and-behavior/actually-know-connections-mental-illness-mass-shootings-gun-violence-83103).

 Who would have expected the poor who couldn't afford insurance would be sicker? I bet obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease make up a huge chunk of the "unexpected"  




 I'd like to see the numbers. How much they got in fees, how much they paid to healthcare, how much was administrative costs.  




 It says he wants to ban semi-automatic weapons but the article doesn't say anything about fully automatic. Shouldn't it be the other way around? I appreciate that he recognizes one 0.1% of gun owners use it for crime but his stances seem inconsistent  














 Except most institutions are constantly barely getting by. Good luck taxing organizations with no money.  




 The purpose of a business is to maximize profit, and many businesses are very good at it. If forced to give people paid maternity leave, they will find some where to compensate the lost money. Possibly expansion funds (yes they exist)  or termination of other employees

 So the tax makes money based on the amount of trade and he wants that trade to decrease which would give him less money than predicted? That makes no sense

 If I'm doing discontinued teams then I'll do Marquette. The MU and UW combo would make heads roll  




 Spring football/basketball? 




 Yeah I saw that, it's for frats  




 Lurker making a post, forgive me if I missed answers to this. I played some lacrosse in high school, now finishing school in Boulder after deciding against the CU club team because of time restraints. I've been itching to get back into play and have come across some boulder leagues. I was wondering if anyone here plays in them and has recommendations. I'm not sure what gear I have left from high school but I know I'll need a new stick and helmet.  




 I've been on that sub a few times, they love Colorado. I played years ago but didn't have the time for our club team. There's a boulder league I'm looking at but I wish they would do intramural  




 Yeah our men's club could easily make the jump. I'm not saying they would be an immediate power house, but they could compete. They won nationals in 2014, lost in the final last season. Women's moved to d1 via title ix and do decently but were a shitty club team beforehand. We have everything in place for it to happen, they just need to navigate title ix restrictions. A rivalry would easily form between CU and DU. 

The Denver outlaws pro team won a title recently, DU won ncaa, Colorado and CSU have recent club titles, ncaa regional was in Denver, world games were here last year. It's getting big in Colorado  




 Game 3 this year, Sept 19, 5pm at mile high  




 Colorado won nationals in 2014. They had two plays on ESPN top 10 but I can't find the video now  




 [Here's ticket info] (http://www.cubuffs.com/ViewArticle.dbml? DB_OEM_ID=600 ATCLID=209140439). It looks like Oregon is family weekend so that's another way tickets will be harder to get. You should look into mini packs. It's $77 for 3 games but you could get better seats if you pay a bit more money. I highly recommend going to the Rocky Mountain Showdown. It isn't a huge crowd but there is plenty of hate to go around, especially with recent years. 




 We did, and Cross Country  




 What time zone? 
East Coast people can enjoy a 1am match up of Colorado at Hawaii on what's technically a Friday morning  




 What is the most popular spring sport at your school? 
Colorado has no popular spring sport but hopefully lacrosse if it gets added like Girls  lacrosse did  




 University of Denver doesn't even have a team. Their lacrosse though, I would go nuts if CU made a d1 team half that good  




 Are you in the Boulder area? Those tickets will be "harder" to come by. I say harder because season ticket holders and students won't be giving up their tickets, USC has a huge alumni base in Colorado, and Oregon has random fans everywhere. 
Best advice, don't get tickets in the visitors area, those are the worst seats in the stadium. I would just go to the Folsom box office web page and buy tickets before season starts. Sure you could get some scalped tickets a few days before the game but the could be more expensive.  




 I haven't seen any Nebraska or CSU attire on tours. I'll see the occasional CSU shirt and people will look at them funny but that's it. 
For some reason people think it'd 100% OK to never wear CU gear but always wear USC/UCLA. Even when the team comes to town they'll wear that to games. I don't give a shit that you're from LA and your dad is the dean of X California schools, you're at CU now  




 That's just not a person you want at the school if they were serious. Not because of being a rival fan but total disrespect of an academic institution that's taking time to consider you  




 As if I needed another reason to hate Ohio State fans  




 It would be too easy  




 USC

 There's a difference between popular and spamming. People are still posting the attendance articles. Do they not look at the front page? They're just trying to spam and get karaoke. You don't need 20+ posts saying Sanders got a big crowd.  




 I didn't say anything about the event, I said this sub is immature.
