 My dad is getting rid of his Pioneer [SC-AK310 speaker system](http://welectronics.com/stereo/sc-ak310.jpg) for a newer upgrade. Could I connect a controller to these such as the DDJ-SX or DDJ-SR? What cable(s) would I need?  




 Definitely want to go darker, get to a darker brown like in [this](https://www.3wisemen.co.nz/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/6efaed196d6ddc33b03f911d25dbe699/b/t/bt1068_1.jpg) picture 




 Bought [this](http://i.imgur.com/cg6EaRz.jpg) leather belt today, got tricked by the lighting to make me think it was darker. What is a good way to darken it? Would oil rub off on the clothes I wear with it? 
























 Just got a pair of Clarks Desert Boots in the mail, but I am confused on the sizing. I wear an 11 in Vans and dress shoes, so I ordered a 10.5 in CDBs. However, the shoes still feel somewhat big. Should I send them back and size down to a 10? Do CDBs usually fit loosely? (The fit of the shoe isn't bad, it just isn't perfect). 




 I'm in love with [these](http://us.puma.com/en_US/pd/el-seevo-canvas-mens-sneakers/pna887706697532.html?selvar=true), and for $36, how can you not get them? 




 If someone wants to PM me a code that would be fantastic. 
























 I really just want a cheaper version of a brogue boot. Something inexpensive, but still durable.  




 I love [these boots](http://www.allenedmonds.com/aeonline/producti_SF0181_1_40000000001_-1_) but need a MUCH cheaper option. Like around $100-$150. I definitely want burgundy as my color, but I am definitely open to looking into other styles, materials even (doesn't have to be leather, could be suede, what are options outside of suede burgundy CDBs?) 




 my question really is just how much is your heel supposed to move 
























 This is my swamp. 




 Going to homecoming this weekend (I'm a senior in high school) and I was wondering if it's appropriate to wear a knit tie with a 2 button suit. Aren't knit ties supposed to be more casual? Also, what is the appropriate width of a knit tie? I know they're supposed to be skinnier, but what is the correct width? 2 in or 2.75 in? 




 I recently updated chrome along with a bunch of other windows 8 updates and now my browser sizing is off. The resolution is blurrier and larger than normal. My laptop is 1920x1080 and it feels like I'm back at 1360x768 when using chrome. For example, here is my new tab page, clearly something happened to the resolution as this image used to be full screen: [Here](http://imgur.com/DofT7ca)

How can I fix the resolution of chrome? 





























 [Here is the link](http://www.bestbuy.com/site/aiaiai-tma-1-beatport-edition-over-the-ear-dj-headphones/4860443.p?id=1218555763360 skuId=4860443#tabbed-customerreviews) to these headphones. They were shown in [DJ Ravine's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrnKWBkAk4I) headphone review and are normally priced at $200. I already own pioneer hdj 500 headphones and I am happy with them. Is this deal too good to pass up? Or would it not be worth it, meaning should I just wait to upgrade headphones to something better like the Sennheiser hdj 25-II?

Tl;dr- Do I upgrade or keep my pioneer hdj 500s?

Edit: Ended up buying these before the price increase, burned them in for 12 hours overnight and I'm definitely happy. Not as bass heavy as the hdj 500, but a clear upgrade. More comfortable, better isolation, and better sound overall.  







































 I live about 30 miles away from a nuclear power plant, so anything associated with that would freak me out.
