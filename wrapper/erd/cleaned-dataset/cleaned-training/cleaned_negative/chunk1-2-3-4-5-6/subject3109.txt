 Always work if you can, it never looks good to have dead time on your resume even if it means taking menial employment. I have had very positive feedback from potential employers for this and I believe because of my strong work ethic that I've beaten out people who were more qualified then I because they had long period of unaccounted time (unemployment) on their resumes. Any employment is a learning experience good or bad. I've never applied for unemployment, employers really like to hear that.

 RX's are better but only for being what they're advertised to be chemically where as street drugs are what ever the basement chemist put into it to manufacture it. However I agree that RX's are as dangerous as uncontrolled street drugs primarily due to misuse and big pharm company greed. And I don't know why you were down voted as your inquiries were reasonable.  




 I'm not sure from the document you cite how you've come to conclude this. 




 I get my drugs legally from my Dr *just like Michael*.

This was my attempt showing that point.

So I agree with you. 




 I've never taken street manufactured drugs mainly due to the lack of oversight and quality control in the manufacturing, I get my drugs legally from my Dr just like Michael . My brother in-law died from a hot shot of street heroin.  If something doesn't feel right don't do it.
