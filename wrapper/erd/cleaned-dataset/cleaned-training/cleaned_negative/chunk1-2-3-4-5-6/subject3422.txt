 Thanks -"pre-sliced bread emoji" 




 Google... :( 




 You serious? Man I kinda want bread delivered to me too! 




 True, but mean something like the sizes or quantity of your diet; if that reflects your personality? 









 Many ppls say that 60fps does not work on ie11. It might not work on ie11 on windows 7 but it surely works on windows 8.1 .8.1.1. In fact ie11 on window 8.1 I more graphics efficient than chrome. I use ie as my main browser and have only needed to use chrome once. (to watch anime.. animebaka.tv) ie does not support certain html formats. I only use chrome for one website though... anyways ie is faster on my PC. Opening and running sites 




 I'm not from the U.S, but I think that there are too many sub-cultures in the U.S. (Reagarding the way they treat eachother). Like with most other big countries. Certain States should split and create some sort of sub-U.S 




 'Cause they are afraid of all kinds off insects. And if they see one they want to get the f*uck out 




 Well, I define normal as just regualr ppls. Like people whose jobs don't involve using a PC so much as e.g. Photographers, Music Producers etc.. Or just school kids w/o ambitions regarding Technology... 




 i have f.lux too.  used to have rainmeter. But it cluttered my tiny notebook screen so i uninstalled it. I have Rocketdock though 




 Well, I'm kinda a 'jack of all trades - geek'. I just want to learn EVERYTHING. So I've got Photoshop, FL Studio, iTunes, Rocketdock and a bunch of hardcore Windows and Android Customization Software(I hardly use anymore) on my PC. My question is... what do you "normal" dudes and dudettes use on your PCs

My question is... what do you "normal" dudes and dudettes use on your PCs 














 Do you fart on set? Plz say yes.  And this is indeed not a dumb but a stupid question.  
























 None. None was the worst birthday I had. No one remembered no one did jack shit.  




 Penises though I am not convinced that it is unhealthy.  




 OMF so true.  




 But isn't that kinda a double standard. It's like it's perfectly fine to call a girl beautiful. But if it's a dude... I've only heard gay guys say that a guy was beautiful. And I don't even believe that most gay dudes do. In movies, songs and almost every media girl are call cute, nice, beautiful, bewbs, "that one with the large bootay" etc. But except for cute I've never heard a man being addressed like that... :( 









 For my last headphones I researched for almost four months (not a random number) and as I was leaving the mall I started noticing the ads for the alternative choice. I virtually died inside. It is true though that the excitement wears off after purchase 














 I wear headphones the whole day so I don't notice what is happening around me  




 What I'm saying is that negro is a direct translation from black. Well great, the field masters used it. Why should negro be any worse than saying black? Where if you say African American or dark skinned you are seen as more culturally insensitive as when you say black these days. ?. If they would have said something different to blacks those days, I would have taken that as an insult.  

I'm black myself BTW 




 True true.  But I brush hair for hair. So I guess it is called hair brush for me. Oh forgot to mention that I only have a hair. :( 




 Yeah it's like "negro/nigger/negger"; shouldn't be an insult. Has bad history, which caused it to be an insult. Nigger and nigga are only variations of this and anyone who uses a variation as an insult is simply stupid, gosh!! So the meaning of gay comes from happy. I guess that is from where the homosexuals got it? It should also not be an insult.  




 ODESZA - My Friends Never Die
Mark Johns - 5 South (Prod. Alexander Lewis)
Lauren Desberg - Rock Steady 




 It will. Because you will never get to spend $3.04 ever again. It'll always be something like $2.99 or $3.50 




 I'm kinda a narcissistic arse-hole sometimes. Also I'm like the perfect human being; I mean why would anyone not like me... 




 Chicken = Africa. my friend  
























 Mine are The Worst Guys, shadows and Sober. Pink Toes is epic though.  




 It is actually shit click and drag 




 Its a lie?! NO. It's like Santa. They all exist. You are all lying.  




 That ain't even necessary!! 




 He's the best. :$$ 




 Thanks. Just restarted using RM after two years again. So I kinda missed out on a lot.

 Right click on watch. 

Click 360

Go to @Resources\images

Rename crown line.png and crownback.png to anything you like. (I did crownback not.png and crown line not.png) or you just delete them

 




 Yeah. I just found a method to run from RocketDock/Desktop

#YOU NEED TO SAVE BOTH LAYOUTS FIRST


TO MAKE THE JOB EASIER FOR YOU UNHIDE APPDATA. if you don't know how to do so look it up. 


Create two .bat files using Notepad 

Type:

**Taskkill /im Rainmeter.exe**
(***repeat for the amount of skins you have loaded + the one above is the process itself***)


(Enter)


**start "" "C:\Program Files\Rainmeter\Rainmeter.exe" "C:\Users\[*USER NAME*]\AppData\[*SKIN LAYOUT NAME*]\Rainmeter.ini"**


**INCLUDING QUOTATION MARKS**


Save as .bat


Do again for both monitors

^NOTE^: don't forget to change the screen layout name to the one of the second monitor. After you copy and paste. 

PS: you can convert to .exe. With online program. When compiling to exe check invisible Program. Now cmd will not show while running script.  




 This happened to me too. I run a laptop with a second monitor. Everything on the second screen ends up disorganized on my monitor when disconnected. 

My last resort, after hours of trial and error, was to create two layouts. One for single monitor on the move and another for dual monitor. Tested and it works well. As for now this is the only solution. I am still looking for a method to load the layouts from the desktop/rocket dock  (too lazy to enter the program everyone at school.)

I'll keep you up to date.  




 Right click on visbubble and click (first option) __VisBubble__ (bold).


Settings.ini should be right the. 


Change values for bubble radius and extrusion of lines and you are good to go.  




 ^ what he says. Try [TextTime](http://jlynnxx.deviantart.com/art/Textime-1-01-Rainmeter-Skin-372069753)

 Since I moved to a laptop a few months ago, I have stuck to using IE11. Don't judge me, but I have found it to be remarkably good, as it supports auto-correct, touchpad zoom and smooth scrolling which I absolutely love using. I use a mouse while producing music and therefore the smooth scroll comes in handy.

I do know that there are plugins for this on the chrome store, and at chrome://flags. But these controls are often wonky and I'd like them natively and stable in chrome. I do prefer IE over chrome at the moment as there are certain sites which format wrongly on IE. IE also does not completely support HTML5.

For now I'll stick to IE having chrome installed as alternative, for the sole reason that IE is easier to use for the laptop. I'd be happy to switch to chrome in an instance, if they integrate smooth scroll and tp zoom natively.

I do know that this is not the perfect place to portray my opinions, but frankly IDGAF. sorry guys 




 So I've noticed that the ie plugin page only has a small amount of plugins listed there. Unlike the chrome store or the Mozilla store most plugins are on independent sites. Anyone who uses IE11 frequently post your favorite plugins and links.

 Mad of now there is no option for that. :( 




 I did address the comparability improvements. I just wish I could kinda put a skin on that:( 




 So 7 hours ago FL12 was released. I, like probably everyone else here, immediately downloaded and installed it. Unlike the most of you I did not try the beta though, for I was waiting for a stable version. Only after I had installed FL it loaded with a flat yet childish UI that I personally do not favor over FL11's. The font is a impact roundish font that is rather large at times and does not blend with the interface. FL12 looks like a toy to me. I prefer FL11's professional looks.
KUDOS TO ImageLine for adding touchpad usability. Now I can work on the go. Rarely do, but thanks.  




 Thanks. Just got them new. Usually never wore my old ones. 




 So as a 16 year old teen with rather large ears and glasses my helix tore. I LISTENED TO MUSIC SO LONG THAT MY HELIX TORE! It happened because my headphones pushed my glasses to rub and pierce the skin on my ear...that's my best audiophile story. I want to know what you guys have done concerning music. 
























 Thanks. Stone Mountain is very clich rap not like the r amp;amp;amp;b filled because the internet. But Kauai is so pop. I like [sober](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW_ysmivrFU),[poke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CluJFuO4emA) and the palisades though

 Yeah. The idea behind is dope to me though. Like because the internet. So much work behind gambino
