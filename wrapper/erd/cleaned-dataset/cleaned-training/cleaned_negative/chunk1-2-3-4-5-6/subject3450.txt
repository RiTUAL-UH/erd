 Agreed!  Don't smoke the dips, smoke (some cold some hot, depends on the ingredient) the ingredients.  I also recommend pairing smoked queso with a good vienna style lager 




 Very fun x-mas album, big fan now! 




 Who is this???? 




 I believe my immediate words, out loud, were, "Holy Shit" 




 Awesome, thanks for the reference, best one so far,  once the paycheck comes in it's ordered.  And yeah, I'm looking for some help in my area, I've posted on craigslist and other subs to find a work out buddy, all my frends are industry people and I"m kind of on a 8-6 schedule 




 thanks 




 I want to start lifting, but not very familiar with proper form and safety.  Does anyone have tips, guidelines, or any good (preferably free) resources online.  I have a very physical job in a brewery and figured I might as well bulk up to make work easier as well as other things 




 So I really want to bulk up and get big.  Would like someone I can rely on as a spotter who has some experience power lifting.  I'm starting out at level 1 so I need someone who's patient.  I want a motiator and not a douchey gym rat.  I work at a brewery and have 3 very clear goal.

1)  Make my life lifting and moving kegs a lot easier

2)  Throw a shot put A LOT further.

3)  Make my cheating ex girlfriend sorry she left me for a stoner who works the register at a fast food joint.

I have a 24 hour fitness membership and will be working out probably after or around 8pm.  I'm motivated and committed but not knowledgeable in lifting, safety, form, all that good stuff.  If you're looking for a work out buddy, hit me up. 




 price? 




 I recommend skinning it.  Best to use a very sharp knife, about 6-8 inches long, take your time, go slow, you should be ok 




 best place for the top line for your beard is where the top of your ear actually meets your head 




 Go For the Gibson! 




 trim it short with an electric trimmer.  Keep staight, clean lines with a good straight edge razor, some even have a single blad on the reverse side for precise lines, that will give you a good groomed 5 o'clock look 




 I've had good experiences with Wahl Hair trimmers.  I've bought cheap trimmers before and it seems like they pull hair more than clip it, in my experience, you get what you pay for. 




 6 days a weeks I just wash it in the shower with soap with the rest of my face.  Saturday mornings I have a ritual of shampooing and conditioning with American Crew, it leaves it very soft,  I have a more curly facial hair type. 




 Submitting a pic of your face or chin would help, I myself and 2 1/2 months in on a full beard no trimming, feels very liberating, highly recommend it 




 So unfortunately I've been using Garnier frucetice since I was a teen because that was always what was in the house.  I've found out recently  a combination of that, and my poor diet may have possibly lead to my hair loss and may be reversable to an extent?  Anyone have info on this, or even better, a good shampoo that will promote hair regrowth???? 




 can Vitamin B and Iron help grow back lost hair??? 




 Soooooo......... should I upvote this? 




 Not a clarinet 




 yeah, the entire joke is Dwight says "tweeter" ugh sigh 




 just curious, who's your favorite Batman villain? 









 Favorite one so far, face yould have been awesome, you have a pretty smile. 









 The other gentlemen had fine beards indeed.  But you sir, got robbed. 









 Well maybe, that's just like, your opinion...  man 




 very pretty smile 




 agreed.  it's also a major plus smelling the peppermint and menthol extracts early in the morning.  Better than a cup of coffee. 




 Thanks for the tip on "training" the hairs.  I started wax just so I could get away without trimming the lower ones.  I eventually want to compete on the local market for beards and stache.  If you come up with a recipe you like please send it my way. 




 please excuse my typo's, feelin lazy 




 I'll have to give it a try.  I have some of their pommade and have had it for years, never had a reason to use it.  I use the american crew shampoo and conditionern on my beard once a week or before dates and my beard comes out sooooo soft 




 I'll check them out, thanks 




 Thanks, I was wondering about the American Crew pommade I've had some sitting around forever and don't have a reason to use it.  i do use their shampoo and conditioner for my beard and it comes out very, very soft. 




 I'm growing a pretty lengthy beard, with hopes in the future to compete.  My mustache is to the point to where I have to do something with it styling wise.  Are there any recommendations or waxing or styling products.  Went to CVS and picked up some Clubman's, didn't know if there were any othe rproducts worth looking at.

Also any good recommendations on good soaps or champoo's for the stache or beard? 




 Barcadia on Henderson has giant jenga (jenga with giant pieces so the tower's 4 feet tall)  good place to drink and meet people 




 Best new place: Jack Mac's Swill   Grill
Best nice but fine dinning place: Victor Tangos 




 appreciate the help, I'll check it out when it's not so hot 




 thanks, I'll check soon, when it's not 103 outside 




 I have a 6 cylinder 2006 mustang.  The alternator went out (already fixed) but we tried jumping the battery before we knew it was the alternator.  When jumping my car, my girlfriends neighbor, being the jackass he is, put the jumper cables on his battery backwards.  We were lucky in that the only thing that died was the stereo.  Anyone know what it might be, I receive no power.  If it s a fuse, which one is it? 




 really?  What kind of asshole is that kind of jerk to someone who's bummed out after they just put their dog down 




 dude, i'm just bummed out, don't be a dick 




 Dallas is not a hippie friendly city by any means 




 I Love Bunk, wait... that sounds bad. 




 You are freakin adorable 




 Don't know anyone, but I bet there's a lot of good tutorials for free (the best price) on youtube 




 and Dino's is pretty solid, best sandwich in the metroplex in my opinion 




 yeah, I'm not on that side of the Metorplex any more, but I love chilling out there when I can 




 it's just a really cool unique bar, hadn't been in a while.  I used to work there when I turned 21.  Last time I hung out there it was pretty much a hipster joint.  Good drinks, pretty good beer list, and a great jukebox.  The patio outside is great too. 




 If you're a hipster (or not but like to people watch and point and laugh at hipsters, i won't judge either way) check out the caves lounge.  Awesome lunch spot is Dino's subs, you can also go ice skating at the parks mall 




 Giant Jenga at Barcadia (knox henderson area) or at Goodfella's Pizza (Plano boardering frisco on Preston) is always fun. 




 The French Room, The Marquee Grill (used to be on the pastry team, it's awesome) Fearing's at The Ritz, Bolla at the Stoneleigh Hotel, Abacus 




 Here's a good place to order online: http://www.viennabeef.com/  I know how it feels.  I used to live in the East Village.  Have the Hot Doug's tattoo on my shin and everything.  I have not found a place yet though, but Angry Dog in Deep Ellum is supposed to be really good too. 




 So I finally dipped my toe in the soda pool.  I made a mediocre ginger ale but an awesome Basil Mint Soda.  I used active dry yeast and it worked very well.  It did make the soda's muddy with yeast biproduct though.  Anyone know how to make a clear soda or possibly the same thign with much lest yeast biproduct? 




 If you REALLY want to...  Cold smoke it, plenty of info out there as to how to cold smoke if you haven't yet, let it rest at room temp for half an hour, season it and sear it or do what you will 




 Anything off of Fishbone's "If you give  monkey a brain, he'll swear he's the center of the universe" album, Primarily 'Servitude' it's a pretty good song 




 You can do macaroons, or, you also have the key ingredient for the best park of any meringue pie. 




 It most certainly does 




 maybe not, but close, his last special that he produced on his website that he was selling downloads for sold $4.5 million, he produced himself.  I know much of that cash goes elsewhere, but without a production co. he's on the right path

Carlos Mencia:  Hosting late night infomercials selling gym equiment and workout programs.... 




 I know he pulls content off of reddit, youtube, break, ebaums and a ton other sites, that's the whole concept of the show.  It's a show that makes fun of what is on the internet.  Just sayin it's a repost of something that's aired on national television 




 Uhhhh... Tosh.0 two seasons ago? 




 just as effective, works as well, we just got it to evaporation point and lit it to burn it off quicker for efficiency sake.  Not as safe, but in a controlled environment with professionals, much quicker. 




 I tried several times in culinary school to make hollandaise, but I'd always crack under the pressure 




 Seared or grilled salmon in a tomato water broth and roasted asparagus.  If your interested send me a message. 




 Did you cook the whole thing, top to bottom?  If you did you should tail me the recipe. 




 Drugs are a bad, bad thing. 




 Combine it with enough tomato puree to make a chunky sauce, season accordingly and put over penne pasta.  It's a great "poor man's" meal. 




 Yeah, it's all flare for the table side.  The only time I've seen an actualy function for it, is if you're making a sauce with a and you want the primary flavor to be a liquor (say a tequila based sauce) and you don't want the alcohol to dominate the tongue you burn it off. but ahead of time in the kitchen 




 I only have a pump action shotgun.  It's an ok range for that, great if your shooting skeet.  Everyone I met there was nice for the most part, I wouldn't shoot range ammunition though, they carry the cheap stuff. 




 Check the big hotels, corporate hotels usually offer benefits to restaurant workers IF the restaurant is owned y the hotel, not just space leased out to the hotel.  I used to cook for Omni, it was a pretty good operation

 broken down step b step, like I'm 9, awesome! just what I was looking for 




 My friend and I have been homebrewing for a little while now.  We've been bottling and have found it to be a hassle.  We want to switch over to kegging but have no idea where to start.  Resources anyone???

Mucho Appreciado 




 wise girl sounds like a hooker 




 I highly recommend Kayden DiGiovanni at the Skin Art Gallery in Addison.  Check him out at DallasTattoo.net  I have quite  bit of work done, the only 2 I wasn't satisfied with are the ones he did NOT do, and he still even helped me out with them (I've been going to him for 9 years)  Also chek him out at facebook.com/dallastattoo 




 But in London, they don't have Smokey the Bear, they have SMACKEY THE FROG! 




 wow, really awesome, despite what ever kitchen you were in.  Are you in business or just do this for friends and family on the side? 




 It was an awesome show! 




 Very nice, never been out to that part of the country, can anyone visit the sound and go clam digging 




 Do any redditors out there have knowledge as how to practically calculate something on the scoville heat scale?  I'm working on a hot sauce and would like to know the actual SKU for bottling and marketing purposes.  Any information would help 




 ot me beat.  3lbs most I've done.  I was cooing in a restaurant going out of business and the last day we were open my Chef "cleaned out the walk in"  it was a race between myself and the food runner on a 3lb plate.  The volume was rough, but forcing it down fast was far worse. 




 I don't know who you are.  I don't know who your friends are.  But that, that is amazing 




 nice, my buddies and I have worked with ghost peppers before.  We had a dick coworker who caused problems (we were all chefs in training) so we steeped ghost peppers in water and used that to make a dense gelatin and put his knives in it them set it in the cooler over night.  Highly recommend trying it some time.

But thanks, I'll have to check it out, I work right around the corner from there.  How many wings does one have to polish off? 




 nice, that's the kind of stuff I'm looking for, what else do you guys have? 




 thanks for the suggestion, but looking for local places, I could do BWW challenge anywhere, but thanks 




 Any one out there in Dallas know of any good restaurants that have some sort of eating challenge.  I'm aware of the wing challenge at Pluckers.  Used to work there so I'm very aware.  Any others?  Would anyone be game to join up and start a group for it? 




 The Pearl Cup in the M Streets area is the best coffee I've had in Dallas 




 Sweet, never thought I'd see this place on the net, especially reddit.  I live half a block from there. 




 Yeah we do 




 Private message me, I'm interested and local 




 Bonnie Ruth's up in Allen has an awesome brunch buffet with every classic you can think of.  Dessert is was included too which we thought was really cool. 




 that's amazing, how much time did it take you to piece it all together

 funny, they don't look asian 




 I think it's sooooooo cool you're a Batman fan, not a lot of chicks are superhero fans let alone Batman fans 




 Chubby is awesome, keep posting 




 Good God, why can't I find any Ranger's fans like you in my neighborhood.  I"m on the wrong side of the metroplex 




 I bet t was a "B" channel on the cable box 




 "allow it" to happen for a while, put up remote surveillance camera's in your house that you can view from the web or your smart phone.  Use this to file for divorce, leaving her penniless.  Once he paper work is ready, hang onto it.  Wait for her to have her ex over one day.  While their sleeping in your bed together, sneak into your own house with another woman.  MAKE SURE SHE IS HOTTER THAN YOU PHILANDERING WIFE.  She could be an ex, some girl at the bar, a co-worker, a hooker, it doesn't matter.  Drop the paper work on the coffee table while being un-heard, then start going at it as rough and as loud as possible.

Really make it loud.  When your wife comes out with her ex, don't stop, just smile.  With one hand give a thumbs up, the other hold up divorce papers.

She'll get the point.  After a while there's not much that'll fill the void from being hurt by your ex, but bourbon will help.
 




 I have no words sir.  Touche 




 Any which way you cut it, you're still sucking a dick. 




 Go for a small dice and when you sautee your mire poix go for a darker carmelization (careful not to burn)  You should get a sweeter taste.  I like to use this in my marinare and pizza sauce.  2 carrots, 2 stalks of celery and 1 onion, 2 garlic cloves 1/2 cup olive oil, 2 16 oz cans of tomato puree and 1 small can of dice tomatoes.  Simmer the mire poix and garlic, add tomatoes and cook out for 2 hours, season.  For marinara leave be, for pizza sauce blend.  Pretty tasty, and if you blend she'll never know it's there.

 At what point in your life have you been the most lost and conflicted about making a personal decision.  How did you handle it and what were the outcomes.  If you had to go back, would you have done the same thing? 




 You are seriously, CRAZY adorable 




 Yeah, I've been into Neil Young for a while.  29 years old and have been into his stuff since early high school, very cool pic, thanks for sharing it

 Ha, I'm way too curious for that to be a deterrent  




 From Opie (SoA) to Dopey, sorry man, never shave again 




 Yeah my whole plan is to treat it as a donor bike and throw as much as I can on a new rigid frame.  I did have a Honda shadow 750 ace.  Very reliable bike.  Only complaint is it was limited on customization and many parts on the baby that should have been metal were plastic or fiber glass.  Road like a champ though. 




 Thanks for the feedback, good knowledge for a HD TIL (no sarcasm intended)  I did find one auction site that sells everything from repo's to totalled out bikes.  Minimum bids start at about $200.  Don't have it saved on my phone but cam send a.link later if you're interested

 I believe you're not allowed to do that awesome spin move to go from reverse to forward that Jason Statham does in every driving movie.  It is acceptable to do so in the afternoon though 




 Very lovely, happy 21st 




 Thanks for the lead, but it looks like they only deal in metric.  I have friends into cb750 rebuilds, will forward them here. 




 "Pearl of the Stars" by Coheed and Cambria.  Not because of the content itself, but because of the emotional connection to that song and an ex.

 If you wanted to use beer or wort product to get a starter going I recommend using whole, fresh, unacidulated and unused grain of your choice.  2 row is cheap, and spin it in a food processor untill it a fine flour, sift and start your starter

 "Last Call" is a great read.  Its everything you'd ever need or want to know about Prohibition in the United States.  It also has a lot of great knowledge of the long term and current effects from the fall out of.

 Never canned it before, I either serve it immediately or cryo-vacced it and gave/sold it to friends 




 2 celery stalk, 2 carrots and 1 LG red onion small dice lightly sauteed in 1/2C olive oil, when translucent add 2lg cans tomatoes puree and 1 small diced tomatoes.  Season with salt, black pepper and herbage to taste, simmer on low for as many hours as possible, puree and stain if you'd like

 Wings with Dad while watching the homerun derby, not a bad way to celebrate! 









 Yeah, no welding experience, i didn't even think of that, i was more concerned with setting the petcoc and running a gas line 




 Never done a chop, used to work for HD at a dealership, in parts.  I have a pretty good starting knowledge but some things like gas tank set up and jetting carbs make me a little nervous.

 My camera got dropped about 6 feet.  Everything works fine except the shutter button.  Any idea of how to repair it or anyone who will.  Sony wants $250 just to look at it.

 We made sure not to serve before the ceremony,  afterward, well, different story 














 My old compouter died in the worst of ways. I just got a new desktop, Windowsn 8 and downloaded the most recent version of Zune Market place.  I have a 32G Zune HD,  How do I get everything from my Zune to my desktop.  Apparently syncing it is enough. 




 God Bless Texas, where was it? 




 You ma'am, have the perfect pair! 




 Best place I've found so far is Jerry's Woodfire Dogs in downtown Lakewood.  I actually have the Hot Doug's logo on my shin and spent plenty of time there, nothing here I've found has been that close 




 We have some scratches in the (what we hope) surface area of our skin wrap on our company's delivery truck.  Anyone have solid experience on how to buff out the scratches if it's possible?  Any solid links to information would be helpful too, google didn't do much for me on this search. 




 Very Interested, I live near GWB and Custer, I work at The Lakewood Brewery at Jupiter and 635, very close by, I'm interested in what you guys may have to offer.  I know I won't be the first one, but I don't have an athletic bone in my body, would like to turn that around

 Have any Dallas redditors shopped around different Crossfit gyms?  I was lookking for recommendations on price and quality.

 It's an awesome brewery too thanks.  See above comment for second half though

 I really hope these aren't the same guys I'm thinking of.  Last Beer Week 3 guys claiming they were starting a cidery came into the bar I was working at (Jack Mac's) for the cask taping.  We caught them trying to steal beer off of the firkin.  Then they got so wasted 2 passed out at their table, then we caught them trying to walk their tab.  Hope its not the same guys, karma is a bad hangover 




 I actually have been loosing weight, see comments below.  I have a very physical job at a brewery, hauling kegs.  I've cut back on my drinking and have been making smarter food choices.  Next paycheck I'll be able to afford a membership to a gym already picked one out.  I also throw shot put during the spring (If we get one in TX this year) and will be loosing A LOT of weight during the summer at work whether I try or not. 




 yeah, I think that'll be the first step, I'm gonna start with the longest guard and work my way down 




 Yeah...  he's actually a pretty slim guy, but I noticed that too when I first met him 




 yeah, i'm working on that, been steadily dropping actually, about 15lbs in 3 months was at about 270, I work at a brewery in TX so I know I'll be loosing a lot more this summer 




 I have to respectfully look at the photo again, my hair is going pretty quickly now, it started when I was 21 and has been going exponentially recently, despite healthier decisions, you might want to look again.  But thanks for the encouragement.

 Grapefruit and/or orange marmalade with candied ginger.  You can also make and store an orange cure mix if you cure your own salmon 









 Check out Lakewood Brewing instead.  It's the same price, you get to keep a Belgium style glass, and the lines are A LOT shorter.  They have the same music and food trucks, but it's a lot less pretentious and crowded.  Plus their beer is a lot better, if you're a beer knurd, also more consistent and true to form.  Big Fan!

 I just moved here from Dallas.  I want to be healthier and more active.  I love being out doors and would like to go hiking in the hills out in the desert. 

Any good suggestions on where beginners should go.  I've been to superstition once while visiting a while ago. Where else is good for solo beginners?

I live in Mesa, so anything out this direction would be appreciated.

 Queens, my bad 




 Makes sense for Juice, when he was being pressed in season 4 you find out he's originally from Brooklyn.  The others I haven't noticed.  Jax on the other hand, I've heard Aussie, Brit, and Nor Cal , I think he's getting tired. 




 Are we don't this price is right style? 




 And let the face swapping begin! 




 Marx forgave "Tig's debt" though when Jax turned over the fun business to him though.  Marx was no longer after The by the end of season 5.  Second to last episode of that season, but not sure.

 I agree with OP.  Its a possibility.  I've wrote off trying to predict what Sutter will do or assume he has rules of how a character will go out. 




 In not sure I get the punch line?  Help me out, maybe put a finger on it? 




 Checks and balances 




 I'm personally not taking too much stock in Sutter stating that 2 sons die.  It's possible, but seeing that Sutter likes to go the opposite direction in big episodes from what people think he'll do.....  I think saying that could have been a misdirection.   Plus, if it is true, Nero isn't a Son, neither is Gemma, the death toll could be far greater in the last 5 episode.  Plenty of time for folks to die. 




 Everything here mother was saying Jax took on as a direct reflection to himself.  The rent is punctuated by her saying something about a horrible father and a dead mother right before Jax puts a round through her head.  All foreshadowing Tara's death in a very sneaky way 




 Thunder header 2 into 1 tailpipe is common amongst the bikes in Sons.  You see a lot of the sidekick seats as well.  Its a single piece 2 up seat.  HD diamond black grips.  Those are the big ones.  Chib's earlier bike had the fork tube boots, but I think with the fairing, the boots would clutter your front end too much.  

If you go with the thunder header (has a great sound) or any other full pipe you'll need to do a stage one air intake upgrade as well

Edit: also black lower front fork sliders and HD black magnum wheels 




 Actually very caught up, to the episode.  You didn't soil anything f for me.  Only takes 2 minutes to be considerate for other redditors though 




 Thank You!  I'm glad I'm not the only one who thinks it's Nero.  When he left the room when the sons saw what happen it looked a little suspect.  Then, when the focus was in him at the end and he says, "how could they not leave after what happen".  Clear foreshadowing. 




 Seen the episode already but still.  A spoiler alert tag, I'm sure, would have been much appreciated by some folks here 




 Go back and watch when Venus' mother rants at the kiddie porn studio.  Kurt Sutter drops some serious foreshadowing.  Bravo

 I'm not tech savy, please be patient with me:
I downloaded VLC media player last week and every since I've had problems:

Netflix App wont work
I can't load videos on streaming sites like Coke and Popcorn or ProjectFree
I can't figure out how to get rid of the crap programs that come with VLC

How do I fix this?  I was also curious of people's opinions on the best spyware/malware and free virus protection as well.  Any help would be appreciated. 









 I agree totally with that.  Both probably made mistakes somewhere 




 Rahr is bigger.  I believe they produce more barrelage per year than DEBC does.  I'm not totally sure, I havent checked the BA Forum letter recently.  But that is why I said "bigger than most"

I really doubt S S did what they are being accused of.  I know for a fact there are tap handles in that restaurant that local breweries didn't have to pay for.  That doesn't mean they didn't say what they are being accused of saying, but it doesn't help DEBC's case either.

As for serving Franconia over Deep Ellum, yeah, I don't get that either.  I want there, I dont know what happen.  Not serving there beer could be just an excuse for a deeper issue like you said.  One thing to keep in mind though, liking a certain brewery/style of beer/or individual brew is ALL subject to opinion.  There are some beers that most people in the Dallas scene love that I think are inferior.  There are also beers that I love other people think are shit.  Its all opinion. 




 I don't think they are a massive corporation.  But based on their distribution network, number of accounts, and total barrels sold, they are MUCH larger than most of the breweries in the area.  And by contrast, much larger than a single restaurant that's only been open or about 4 months 




 He's trying to play up being the little guy, a small self distributed brewery.  It helps him look favorable as the victim.  He leads people to believe they're still a small operation, they don't have distribution, which they do, just not in this area.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with picking up a distributor in one area and not another.  But to tell people you don't have when to look like such a small operation when you actually do else where is misleading. 




 In the blog written about this John states that he's the little guy and the victim being bullied.  He stated that he is not distributed by Andrews or BEK which is only half true.  They are still self distributed in DFW, but distributed by BEK in the large southern cities in the state.  Is another good example if how he's misleading and petty 




 FOLLOW UP:  Replaced it with a new one last night from Autozone.  After taxes it was $250.  It took me about an hour and this was my first time making this repair on a vehicle.  The three places (one dealer and 2 national chains) I looked into to do the repair for me, each gave me estimates for $550-$600 for a one hour job.  Proof they're all out to gouge.  Moral of the story... I'm doing my own work. 




 No sources, no references, and a weak looking site...?  Yeah, I'd believe it....  Why was this even posted? 




 Going back through both Deep Ellum's post about this and Scotch and sausage's, and looking in the comments of the previous note our DEBC has had, is scary to see how much some of DEBC's fans have "drank the kool aide" 




 Sorry. I meant to type the word "remember" not tendency.   Was trying to type at a red light and not paying attention.  Was meant to read, "do you remember the brand name?"

 Awesome.  Do you tendency the brand on it? 




 Anyone have a good suggestion on a brand of alternator for an 06'?  My first one lasted 85k miles. In sitting in an NTB with a dead alternator that's 2 years old and Ford is showing me no love.

I'm looking for a suggestion in a quality product that will last more than 2 years.  Also, if there are any maintenance tips to make one last longer I'd appreciate it. 









 They have similar style on Jpcycles.com 









 I used to sell for Harley and ride myself.  The biggest things are enjoying the ride, being comfortable, and controlling the bike.  HD has accessories and mods you can put on the Dyna series to help with all of those.  You can get things like "the reach seat" which is comfortable and moves you closer to your controls as well as curved handlebar riders that will bring your bars closer to you.  Get the bike you want and can afford then customize it to for you.  Do what you want man, is a Harley!

 Go for a straight forward traditional summer beer Czech/bohemian Pils are always a good choice.  Check for local ones NOT in green bottles

 Wow. Topical humor and 16 years in the making.  There are people who are now turning 21 who can now go in there to drink who won't be old enough to get the reference. Still clever though, I must admit. 




 I'm a big fan of keeping it 200mm and under.  I actually prefer a 180mm.  I road the rocket custom when it first came out.  The stability in a straight run was phenomenal.  Turning was tough hard and sluggish.  It really depends what type of riding you want to do.  If you like a at straight haul go wide.  If you like a lot of twists and turns go narrow.

 Jim Vs Dwight 




 I'm actually afraid to click the link, I don't want to be one of the last things I hear before bed 














 My story is a little odd but fitting.  I apparently had a sleep walking problem I never knew about until one particular night my junior year (maybe senior I can't remember) of high school.  

I woke up, shaving, in the shower.  I normally shaved in the shower to save time.  Half of my face was cleanly shaven, no Knicks or, finished my shower and dried off.  I realized I had no idea what time it was so I hurried.

I saw that it was 1:00 and freaked out thinking I over slept by hours and was afraid of getting in trouble.  I jumped into my clothes, grabbed my back pack and ran out the door.

It was dark out.  1am.  But hey, at least I was already dressed and shaved for the day. 




 I agree, grooved concrete is bad enough on a bike.  But a quick stop, downhill, possible wet, over a drain?  I'll find a different route on a bike 




 Were there any clues in the final season to Tommy's identity before the reveal in the final scene?  Did I miss them? 




 How so?  I've been in Harley sales.  When it comes down to it, your going to do one of 3 things after you buy the bike.  1) Your going to ride it and maintain it damning the cost 2) your going to ride it, not maintain it, not respect your machine and let it go to Shit, or 3) let it sit and rot in your garage.

Any hobby worth doing is going to get more expensive as you immerse yourself further into it.  Fact of life. 




 All in all, if you do your own maintenance, expect to pay between 8-10k for the bike and expect  the same in parts 




 Really I don't intend any disrespect in my response.  But if you're the type to ask "Is it worth the cost of  maintenance?" I suggest a different hobby.

Woodworking:  oh wait.  Saws have to be maintained and lumber isn't cheap.  Oh, and safety gear.

Maybe try hiking: but then you have trail fees, safety gear, books to buy, camping equipment if you get really into it.  Plus all the time you have to take off of work for trips.

Maybe canoeing or kayaking.  Your initial up front cost is a $1200 kayak if you want something new and versital.  Oh and the carrying rack on your car, stuff for day trips, fees to get into national parks.  Oh yeah and safety equipment like beacon lights and life preservers.  Don't forget paddles, they cost too.

Shit that's expensive too.

Everything you do is going to cost money.  Every easy to get your ass out and experience something is going to cost you.  Get educated, get prepared, then say fuck it and enjoy your self.  

But don't forget to but a helmet.  




 Good eye.  You do have to add in quite a bit for the 3imch BDL primary drive, that'll run you up.  If your not doing the work your self estimate a min. Of $60 an hour for labor.  Might get a better labor deal from a local bike shop than a Harley shop.

 How do you think Wendy will go out? 




 I don't really think Sutter would have a problem writing her off in the last episode.  He's given her such av spotlight for so long what an epic ending for a character 




 Jax, Nero and Juice took the whole episode, but Juice took it the most 




 An eye for balancing books like Bobby...?  I see what you did there. 




 What ever I can do to help ;) 




 He's from Houton, they do that down there

EDIT: My bad, thought your comment was from a different post I had made earlier, that's what I get for day drinking while on reddit on my day off. 

I have no actual knowledge whether or not this kid is from Houston.

But.... Seriously...  Houston Sucks, fuck those guys 




 Your the kind if weirdo I want to be working next to in a kitchen all day 




 A red neck kid pretending to be even more red neck.....  And he's way to young to have a belt hanging out from under his shirt...  He'll make for an awesome redditor one day 




 Why would Nero know the whole truth about JT? 




 How about the basement of the Alamo? 




 Poopflinger

That is all 




 Yeah, looks more like JT 




 Pretty sure they had an old episode of Rescue 911 about this same scenario 




 I really didn't intend it to be that.  I grew up Catholic and my dad's step mother had that same type of voice just not as strong.  Everyone I hear Katy Sagal sing it just take me to that memory 




 That's what I thought, but I feel like there was more buzz on here about Tig being the rat than anyone else 




 We've all be discussing who the rat is over the last several weeks.  At first I was annoyed at this topic being dominated by nothing but a bunch of fan theory, but I soon fell privy to it as well.

I've seen almost no discussion on the reveal of Borosky being the rat and anyone's opinion.  Anyone feel cheated at a weak reveal or let down it wasn't a member?  

"Trust me, in here, all I am is somebody's asshole" 




 Wouldn't be surprised if it was just Sutter's way of being funny while extending the table 




 Agreed about the 4th wall.  I think that's my biggest problem with it.  

I also have stylistic issues.  Her sound is very mid 80's gospel country (that's not a shot, I promise). It doesn't really seem to fit the show.  

If she were the lady in the pew behind me at Sunday church I'd be amazed. 




 That's the only thing that makes sense to me 




 No idea 




 The only thing I can guess is 1) people were offended at George RR Martin whipping it out in front of Butters and Scott Malcinson, and constantly taking to two other boys about penises 2). George RR Martin hearten to sue, or 3) crazy government conspiracy and the Fedb didn't want people seeing the biggest shopping day of the year portrayed in such a horrible light 




 I get most of these, I see why.  But Casa Bonita, why the hell would they remove that one 




 The part where you say the man beating another human about the had with a Knight stick was unarmed

 Its time to stop.... Now...  Mike? 




 She is the former wife of 2 founding members, but at the end of the day she is just an old lady, a very scary, (shudders) scary old lady 




 But it would be pretty gratifying seeing her alone 




 Yes, yes you are 




 Zoom in, there's a pasty.  You know, not that I looked or anything.... 




 That never occurred to me.  Good observation, fits in with a lot of the theme of this episode 




 First time I thought it was since he (Venus) wasn't in make up and hair his masculine features shows and it freaked Tig out.  Getting through the episode and seeing their interaction changed that for me.

I think it was dealing with the guilt of Bobby and nerves over the show down at the AB compound.  Venus asks Tig if (s)he'll see him later and he replies, "yeah, maybe"

I think he was nervous about heading to a shoot out ambush where he knew he could have been killed.  Tig knows first hand (pardon the Bobby pun) Mark's guys aren't scrubs. 




 In which case Jax goes to the Mayans club House and Alvarez is in a paper box fort, "You know ese, your authority is not recognized in Fort Kick Ass" 




 I've been thinking the same thing.  Juice wants back in, sons need an insider.  This is Juicey Boy's home now. 




 It was such a bad ass shot 




 It's pretty sad that you're being downvoted for being clever and using real quotes.  Someone quotes "Shenanigans" for the thousandth time in Reddit, and everyone loves it, but apparently there are dumbasses here who don't grasp the concept of repeater. 




 4 peaks brewery for a pretty bad ass brunch on the weekends 




 It had plugins, toolbars and what not, but also a ton of viruses and malware 




 Probably the only intense scene in the film 




 I was going to say the Oakland Raider's fans buuuuuuut..... 




 Yeah, but, the only reason he helps Gemma out and isn't involved with her on any deeper level is because it's unrequited on Gemma's end. 




 It would be 5 years since the show started given Abel's age 




 The more in certain Ratboy is a fed plant.  Maybe not the rat, but FBI. 




 I can't upvote this enough 




 They were able to tell right away he was lying about the cutting.  The delivery at the end of the episode was very innocent. Jax knows Abel wants grandma to get in trouble, he'll put 2 and 2 together 









 Same issue, right there with you 




 I was with you until "or there will ever be one" tonight was a good example of why not to expect anything or assume what will happen 




 Yeah but the mirrored response was still pretty damn gratifying 




 Fuck yeah it was 




 Would be a good submission for /r/woahdude 




 If they are operating under a brewpub license they can sell, if not, if they are licensed as a self distributed or have a distributer such as favorite brands, BEK, or Andrews they are not allowed to sell for off premise consumption 




 Brewery or brewpub? 




 Was it purchased or free?  




 YES^ 




 But for it comes with the refrigerator ? 




 Also, if the are opening a straight production brewery, it is illegal to sell for off premise consumption.  Breweries cannot sell six packs or growler fills in the state of TX.  I just doesn't two years working at one.

And day they only let those who "donated" get growler fills, it'll be s customer service nightmare explaining to their regulars who didn't pitch in that they can't have growlers.  This just had bad idea written all over it. 




 Any increase in your visibility? 




 I recommended this to another redditors a few days ago and they like the idea.  Look up ChopperSwapper on Instagram,  give that a try. 




 I know, as an  amateur with access to a cable television show, I'm certain I could do better in writing a 7 season series with developed characters and deep plots

EDIT: Wow either a lot of redditors didn't get the sarcasm or got it and didn't appreciate it 




 Yeah I'm trying to save up for a build project, its given me a lot of ideas 




 Also a non reddit area: check out chopperswapper on Instagram. 




 The jizz of their enemies 




 I'm not putting too much stock into this, and when I initially had the idea it was to just troll and insight a you in this sub.  Then I started thinking, and my idea became plausible.

What if Jax is the rat.  He's deep in hated for day the club has become and what is cost him.   No one had more knowledge of what goes on in the club and what will happen other than Jax.

Jax is so buried in the guilt of Tara's death, the death of members of his club, and the legacy of Clay's gun running he wants out.  He decides it'd be best for charming and his family to dissolve the club.  He goes out in a blaze of glory, stemming to kill the man who he think murdered his wife.  Mark's bring an Overijssel is just a convenient way to pay the club down so far it falls apart.  After the murder of Jury, no other charters will support SAMCRO.  Then once everything falls apart under Mark's wrath, the club dies forcing members into nomad or other charters.

We all know after season 3 Jax can play the long con.  Dissolving SAMCRO from the inside gives Jax a way to protect his family, his town, and keep other club members from violence or prison.

EDIT: Plus this would be one of the most unexpected things Kurt Sutter could do.  I don't think any one is expecting Jax to be an intentional down fall of the club.  Pulling this out of left field would take everyone for a ride. 




 Jax was the one who offered the patch over though.  The orient of the Grim Bastards was the one who was reluctant. 




 I still am holding out that it's with Borosky or Ratboy though.  I do have a very unpopular third theory that I may or may not post on here 




 Crazy 




 If Tig actually is the rat (I've both stores guessing AND caring) this is actually the only sound argument over heard on this sub in regards to the theory. 




 You know... Most of the time people post pics of their family, and I support it cuz is family even though it might really not be, "old school cool". But that is actually a very cool photo 




 Rat or not (it very well could be) I hope they're is a plant.  That's the one adversary SAMCRO have been up against yet.  Fed plants are something true MC's have dealt with. 




 There's been instances IRL of feds going under cover though and don't things far beyond wrong to keep their cover.  Donnie Brasco is probably one of the more known cases, but also Victoria Steele, is plausible 
























 And there we go

 I've been in the craft beer business for a while.  I even worked for a brewery in Dallas for a few years.  The most aggravating thing was I had no coworkers who could just chill the f*"!k out on good, normal, well made craft beer.  Everyone had to have the biggest, rarest, most elaborate beer to find.  I love craft beer, and the industry.  Not everyone is a hipster, but unfortunately, they're there. 




 If you want to get eye popping with it, keep the same purple, swap the black with a light metallic green with a lot of shine.  The two colors contrast well together 




 Really just an excellent ploy to get beer nerds and hipsters to brag about having whale testicles in their mouth.  Way to go Iceland. 




 In not, but I might, BBC has always been the most impartial news source imo 




 As you so eloquently put, "you don't pneumonia from cold weather". However, a 67 year old man already had a suppressed immune system (fact, immune systems decline with age one past early adulthood years).  Also, cold weather does suppresses ones immune system (fact). The combination of the two would leave him more susceptible to the disease.  Also, I never stated it was fact.  I just said these were the two versions I've heard.

 Troll 2 is the greatest bad movie ever made.  Easy to find on dvd online, and it may be in netflix.  Don't worry about seeing Troll first.  The two are unrelated. 




 Yeah, it pulled me back enough to take my hand off the left grip 




 Come on...  Who wouldn't want a 13 year old television with a busted power button that takes up a ton of space and always has the closed captioning on...?  Its an awesome find 




 Holy crap you're beautiful 




 None of them are absolute musts.  I just didn't know if their were any extraction apps.  Any other media sieves would be great.  It would also be nice if their are any apps to cast documents to the Tv 




 Yikes, that tops mine.  I used to work on the Texas hill country in my very early 20's.  I decided to get a little sun while out riding on my day off and lost the shirt.  I was riding right next to the Guadalupe River and took a cicada going about 60mph.  It struck me about half an inch above the nipple.  Lesson learned. 




 I'm looking to do a project build similar to this.  I'm interested on sine measurements.  What's the backbone stretch, front leg stretch, rake, and cup size? 




 I can confirm that, except it was a cicada 




 Didn't want to go that rout but I think I may 




 I just got my chrome cast in the mail today and getting my new TV in tomorrow.  Other than netflix, Pandora, and of course Chromecast itself, what are some apps that are must have or y'all would highly recommend? 




 Just shoot me a pm, here in the comments is fine too.  Remote doesn't work and CC is stuck on.  Its free, just pick it up.  If your going to just plug a DVD player or cable box into it, it works fine. 









 I've heard two different versions of George Washington's death.  The first the he didn't die of pneumonia, but of syphilis contacted from his mistress.  The other was that he did due of pneumonia.  He was at his mistress' when her husband came home, George Washington peaped out the window nude, in fear of being caught.  He ran a considerable distance home in the snow in the bare, thus contracting pneumonia. 

Tl;dr. George Washington would have lived longer if he kept it in his pants 




 YES!!!!!!!!! 




 No worries, I'm a cowboys fan.  Jerry is a douche. 




 Is it just me?  Every time I see Clay Cooley, all I picture is what Will Farrel would look like if he spoofed a used car dealer or someone running for state comp troller? 




 What ever happens I hope the best for you.  I was madly in love with my best friend in college for 4 years.  I told her how I felt just to finally clear the site and lift the weight.  I knew what her response was going to be, but I manned up.  It got a little rocky for a bit, but soon enough, we were closer than we were before.  What ever happens, I hope happiness for you both.

 I really want to believe this is a joke or a spoof, buuuuuut........ 




 excellent, thanks 




 I think one of the biggest reasons to my understanding, was the Judea was expecting more of a more, for lack of a better word, epic Messiah.  I'm having a hard time finding the right words, but to my understanding, the expectation was to be more majestic showing of who the Messiah was.  The concept of a pour carpenter's son, who traveled by foot, and taught peace and patience was unexpected and a little too radical to be believable. 




 Oh no, I agree, there are others, I don't argue that.  But really, I can only speak for myself and the groups I run in.  Collectively, that's not a good representation of what all of us believe. 




 Upvote for the lyrical content and yeah, it certainly changes the mood.  But there's something about this song I can't get behind.  It's not yarling, but it's something in the vocals that kills it for me style wise 




 Cool, thank you.

So I'm completely ignorant on technological issues when it comes to this type of thing.  Step by step, what do I do.  Break it down like I'm 12 




 This guy (Steve Harvey) seriously ruins Christianity for the rest of us. 




 (GRANTED I ONLY HAVE 1 SIDE OF THE STORY, I still felt compelled to share)  I (or a friend of mine) can reinforce his absolute horribleness.  A good, trusted friend of mine is a general contractor in the North Dallas area.  He got called to Steve Harvey's Dallas area home a few years back and nearly walked out on the job.  He claimed that Steve Harvey only communicated through yelling and screaming at people and had the inability to actually communicate anything like an actual adult.  He was screaming at the crew, his wife, and his children the second he walked in the door.  He said that when his children came home, ran in the door to great them, Harvey held his son by the nape of his neck and said I, "I don't even want to speak to your ass until you run up stairs and your home work is done."  Once again, it's a second hand account, but I trust this person fairly well. 




 Is this the same as a factory reset?  I did one of those about 2 weeks after the update and all it did was reset it to when the phone updated to Lollipop, so not an actually factory reset, more like an update reset. 




 I've posted this on /r/android and have gotten no luck.  Ever since the OS update late November, My cell phone has an extremely low amount of memory and isn't able to make or receive phone calls.  I have a minimal amount of photos on my phone, few unnecessary extra apps, and have removed all music and videos.

Here is what I have:
A Google Nexus 5 in good condition, purchased on Amazon.  
T-Mobile pay by the month account.  
I've done the whole sim card swap through T-Mobile.  
Only 2.1 Gig of available space (prior to the update I had a ton of music and photos and still had 12 gig of space left.).  
The ability to stream just about anything using LTE.  
Use of WiFi.  
Ability to make and receive text messages.  

What i don't have
Insurance on the phone (since purchased in full on amazon, learned my lesson there).  
The ability to make and receive phone calls.  

I've been to 3 different T-Mobile stores and no one's been able to help so far.  Does anyone have a definitive solution to this problem??? 




 So I spent about 45 seconds looking for the hidden vulgar message... 




 At least there's the happy ending of Jax and Tara riding off into the sunset. Haha 




 I think this thread really applies to hire the note was written.  The bite served its purpose well, but just sounded like an idiotic threat the way it was written 




 She's batshit crazy 




 Buried in secrets 




 You seem very smart too 




 I can't imagine how bad it's going to hurry to pull those off 




 Who? 




 Forgot to mention, 30/m, I think it'd be fun 




 I'd be interested in Skyping... 




 Still riding the stock 80' with a 4 speed? 




 Interesting.  I'd love to ride that configuration some time just to try it.  Nothing aggressive, I'm a big fella, don't know if I'd want to put my center of gravity that high 




 More so than a springer seat? 




 Fantastic looking bike.  I've always wanted to know, what does the riding position feel like sitting so high on a posted seat? 




 Gew 




 Glad I could help. Merry Christmas (if you celebrate something else, Happy That) 




 http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Montgomery  Depends which husband you're talking about.  Not sure.  Very few men deserve a woman of that caliber though. 




 Agreed.  Not just beautiful but talented and classy.  Bewitched was my mother's favorite show as a child.  On late night Nick at night we would watch reruns when I was little.  Had a crush on her back then, rekindling that admiration now. 









 Been creeping me the F*** out for 24 years 




 I believe the proper term in, "Yowza!" 




 I need that on a t shirt 




 How is this inappropriate for a 31 year old 




 That didn't take long 




 Did I just motorboat Dickbutt? 




 I am excited about that, going to wait a month or for the price to drop 









 Thanks 




 Would be great for /r/creepy 




 Call me ignorant (I know my inbox is going to blow up for saying that) but what does "Ute" stand for? 




 10/10 would hit.  Bikini girl wasn't bad either 




 *Le sigh* oh vista 




 So, did his amp go up to 11? 




 Maybe, at least they got a little cash and food from craft services for the month or so during filming.  At best, a permanent job skill and connections. 









 Plus, just because TM gets sold doesn't mean he'd lose his job, plenty of businesses get sold with little or no staffing changes 




 I find it interesting (I really do, no judgment passed) that many people who posted on this thread who hate their children never wanted them.  It seems that the child did not much more than be a child, the parent hates them because they never wanted to be a parent in the first place.  It really has little to do with anything the child has done. 




 Where's the Tim Horton's? 




 Any idea at all who the model is? 




 Needs to be on /r/beer 




 I was very much hoping it was a jot dog from Portillo's 




 Agreed.  I've known 3 true 1%ers.  He fits the bill.  I'm so glad his character held true through the whole series.  Props to KS for writing his character true through the whole series.  And even more so to Emilio Rivera for executing him so well 




 Good catch, you're right.  I completely forgot.  So he didn't give up his only son, but still has one son killed to make things even. 




 Glad I'm not the only one who remembers 




 Wow, going through the most recent events  in my life.  EAP is so correct 




 Half Sack, "Hey look!  Its an old fat boy on an old fat boy.....  Sorry"

Juice, "Gemma knows every truth, behind every secret, inside of every lie.  She is the gate keeper" 




 So that's what I missed.  Made the same mistake.  Got a 96% and couldn't figure it what it was 




 It was happy, you were right, which member want in the original 9? 




 The Men of Meg have a boobs to ass ratio requirement, and sorry, but you didn't make the cut 




 This makes me very proud, I can't wait to move back home next week 




 Yeah, I know what you mean, I hate it when my owner sticks her ass in my face too 




 We actually sat and talked for about 5 minutes.  I asked politely for a photo once he was done eating.  After that he asked where I was from/going.  We were in his restaurant and he pretty much asked me a customer service satisfaction survey 









 Keep going, stay strong 




 I was really bummed when the gig cut off right before the second guy gets clocked with the bat.  You see it coming. 




 Eh....  I try to avoid Instagram, cheating ex gf is a sociopath and make my life hell through it, even if I block she'll put up a new profile on their just to find me.  Its a Shane too, I was funding some awesome motorcycle parts through @chopperswapper 




 I wouldn't be surprised if some how spoilers for next weeks episode show up through my scrolling on Tinder 




 That's the exact reason I went on media black out when I got home from work, no Facebook, twitter, reddit, any online articles.  




 My only regret is that I can only up vote this statement once 




 I second that.  I also ride. 70% of your stoping power is in your front break which is our right hand lever 




 When he said he was calling it in and she, in short, said she wouldn't go quietly, I was hoping for an epic suicide by cop scenario where Jax watched from a safe distance, they make eye contact, and he nods once as to say, "Now is the time".  Gemma opens fire and 7 or 8 state troopers take her down in a blaze of glory, as Jax watches from his bike. 




 Go out by Lake Lavon in Collin County, thats the best riding I've found so far.  
 If you want to make a half day trip out to see a pretty bad ass landmark, go to the Baker Hotel in Mineral Wells TX.  The ride is just okay, but the experience of playing around and taking pictures at a nearly 100 year old, abandoned haunted hotel is worth the ride. 





























 That might be the greatest statement made today.  Thank you sir. 









 I see what you did there, hahaha.... "Place"..  haha 




 Pretty cool.  I'm not a fan of the red (not downing it, just my own personal preference) but the front wheel plays well with the fender.  I also like the continuation of the black streak along the entirety of the bike.  I can tell whoever worked on it put a lot of love and care (and cash) into it 




 Thanks for the info, I've always wondered.  I'll keep my eye on the website and Fatbook.  Anything new or interesting coming up for the dyna family? 




 Good deal, thanks 




 Great ride.  Educate me (I simply don't know) war sets it apart as "California" style? 




 Any chance for an old style up swept fishtail exhaust for the modern dyna family?  I love the old school style but the new performance. 




 TIL Monica Lewinsky is now kind of hot.... kind of... 




 I started on a Honda 750 ACE.  I got it when I was 19 and it was the perfect starter bike (for me at least)  750cc engine with a 5 speed got me around well even on the highway but lacked a lot of low end power.  In my case, the lack of power was for the better.  I was a first time rider off in my own.  Gave me a chance to learn to ride without the ability to do something stupid first. 









 Normally not a fan of the duece, but that's a pretty sweet looking bike. 




 You may possibly have the perfect body, just saying 














 Oh wow, You'll have it running in a few days then, congrats 




 Other than air filter or breather what needs work? 




 Much love to you, that's a fun bike and welcome to the family 




 ...my favorite bench 




 Good to know 




 I'm guessing because of the angle at which the tank sits? 




 The tank "lasts longer"?  Please elaborate. 




 If you do it post pics.  I'm curious how it looks on a  bagger 




 Seriously, if I had met you before, and met you after, I wouldn't know it's the same person  




 Check out jpcycles.com or the drag specialties fat book 




 Taste so good make a grown man cry 




 You're welcome.  What style of filter and breather are you going for? 




 I'm looking at starting school for nursing in the fall.  I have 3 semesters of prerecs' before I'm even applying to nursing school.  I was wondering if the Navy provides nursing school, or only accepts graduates?  Trying to explore all of my options and interested in serving. 




 I think it looks great.  Really brings back the old style.  Are you thinking of lower the back end at all, it me help bring the lines and shape together, make things more continuous... 




 Any loss is a victory.  25 lbs is also a big deal.  Keep on going. 




 He'll yeah it's the best place for kolaches.  God bless Texas 




 Slow Loris making a come back! 




 Probably too wide 




 And this is why the show is more intelligent than people give it credit for 




 N64 GoldenEye
Edit: all of puberty, most of highschool, and enough in college to lower my GPA .2 at least 




 I don't think it's down vote worthy,  but disagree.  Was their over acting....Sure, bit I think that scene was one of the better delivered scenes early on. 




 Sin Mint is still on tap at Whole Foods Park Lane.  No where near FW I know, but just letting folks know it's out there if they want it. 




 I had to do a shot and a beer to settle after watching it 




 Probably Jimmy Smitts greatest moment as an actor. 




 The final scene of Na Triobloidi: Jax screaming on his knees on the docks was a rough watch.

Also, What a Piece of Work Man Is:  The scene by the van where we see Tig saying goodbye and Happy crying.  There is something heart wrenching in the moments through the series when  see Happy crying or upset.  I think it's because both, so often he is the comic relief and also he is such a hardened, cold person.  Seeing the contrast is even more devestating. 




 After a few years in the industry if come to find out the ever elusive female craft brewer is a smoking hot ticket.  That's a job you have to be incredibly passionate about.  Educated and willing to do dirty work and get sweaty is also a must. 




 Chicago! I lived there for nine months during  their second worst winter about 4 years ago,  would kill to move back 




 How... wait.... wha.... I just... I dunno 




 I only see some In white  and someone in blue....? 




 A lady on the streets and a Sikh in the bed 




 I have my first "first date" in a long, long time coming up.  I live in Plano and am accustomed to going out in east Dallas.   My date lives in McKinney near Frisco and I'm looking for a unique idea of where to take her near her area.  She's not much of a drinker and a vegetarian, providing a very slight challenge to my normal night out to the pub.  Does anyone have good ideas? 




 Aww.....  I miss the 90's 




 Awesome bike, what's your up, out, and rake? 









 I know, it's a lot of nothing until the last three seconds,  then BAM 




 All I could hear in my head was, "3...2...1... WEEEEEEEEEEEEEE" 




 The amount of skill and control the person has over their knife is impressive. 7 years in kitchens and I've never seen that kind of control 




 Hey Highvolts, did you ever think when Bugs Bunny dressed up like a girl bunny,  that he was kind of hot?  




 My bad, saw the post of face book, chef friends were posting it there abs right redditv would enjoy 









 I'm having a hard time finding an app I like to keep track of my workout routine.  I just started working out and have an organized weekly schedule and routine for when I go in, but would to keep better track of weight, reps and sets. Using my phone would be nice.  Having a book and pen is one more thing to keep track of in the gym.  What does everyone here use? 




 I see the laptop pic, but where's the guy? 




 Hands down my favorite Clyde moment 




 Agreed about agnostics.  I've dated atheists before,  it was a brick wall, never again 




 I call BS on your theory, they both drive POS cars 




 ELI5 why everyone talks to me like I'm an idiot 




 TIL I must be God.  I cry, boobs appear AND I get fed!  I shit and someone else cleans it up.  Plus all of the big people place %100 of their focus on me. 




 It's not a tumor 




 It has been for me too.  But, if I were living in Chicago again where there's a Catholic Church in every neighborhood I would stress about it.  It's a little different here.   The number of Catholics in North Texas is reletively high per capita, but mostly due to a very aging population and immigrants coming from socially Catholic cultures. 




 I don't know if this particular problem rears it's myopic head all over, but I've noticed this problem over the last few years here in the Great state of Texas.  I'm a proud Catholic and have grown up here.  We have our fair share of Catholics here in the Dallas area, but I am still in the protestant bible belt none the less.

Due to my commitment to my career and odd schedule, I've had to resort to online dating.  I don't limit myself to only dating Catholic Women, but practicing Christian or Jewish is a must.

One problem I consistently run into is the narrow mindedness against the Catholic Church.  The best and most recent example I can give occurred last night.  I had been taking to this wonderful woman for a few days now and she apparently missed me identifying myself as Catholic on my profile.   Her response when I told her what church I attend was one of shock.  

She asked if I was only supposed to be dating someone who was Catholic.  I responded no, and that I wished to be married in the Catholic Church and raise my own children Catholic,  but she wouldn't have to convert.  Her response was that,  "She wouldn't want that for her children because catholicism is too extreme"  

I wasn't going to fight it.  I wasnt going to get into a conversation on apologetics.

I'm not sure how to handle this.   Die anyone else feel the adult dating challenges.  It has interfered with a previous long term relationship.  How do y'all handle dating outside of your faith? 

TL;DR I'm catholic,  facing challenges of not having a large dating pool of Catholic Women.  I date protestants and it doesn't work due to narrow mindedness on their part.  What do I do? 




 And what ever sploosh is for men.  Which I guess is just sploosh....  But with semen. 









 Oh please tell me this is going to /r/photoshopbattles

 I didn't so much in the beginning.   Her last two seasons when she started lying and causing problems I lost my likeness for her.  




 Lakewood Brewing Co. (Dallas, TX) The Temptress Imperial Milk Stout  




 It seems the more things advance,  the more stuff we have.   Anybody ever notice a household product that everyone owns that is really just a rip off or a scam? 




 This thread section is why I love reddit 




 Android user here.  With all of the vast amounts of free information on them internets, the play store can't be the only place to go for content.   Any body have any good resources.  I'm not looking for anything specific. 




 I've actuary said,  "Young people's music sucks" and meant it.  




 I had the same thought, would wet myself if that was the case 









 Hey look!  It's an old fat boy on an old Fat Boy......    sorry 




 I'm gonna dunk my balls in your mouth.  Your gonna gag, I'm gonna laugh, we'll be best friends forever. 




 Fuck Zach 




 Fucking Jenny 




 I'm so out of the loop with whatever Jenny is on reddit.  A l8nk to the OP would be nice. 

But Amy Thompson is a fucking whore. 




 The moment when suspicions are confirmed and you have proof your SO is cheating on you 




 Thanks, I haven't changed pillows but I'm washing all of my pillow covers tonight, I also wear a beanie when it's cold and a ball cap at work, washing those tonight as well. 









 Anyone know who's on the left? 




 That's exactly how I read it. 




 He actually did, I would say best short trimmed beard of the 80's 




 And fast, as if it were on some sort of highway 




 Kenny Loggins called....

Edit: Truth be told I'm a little jealous, my beard isn't that thick, keep it going. 




 My mom used to do that with chicken, broccoli, and cheddar.  I never would have thought to make a sandwich with out of it.  Awesome 




 Thank you 




 Thanks.  I've been focusing there too.  I've cut the fast food first and foremost.  I also drank my emotions away all through the month of December.  After making an ass out of myself at a NYE party I decided to stop drinking, at least until I've showed myself I don't need it.  I recently took up a job at whole foods.  That has helped me keep focus on what goes into my body.  




 Things got a little shitty for me this last year, but, at the risk of sounding cliche, today was my first new day.

Mid October I left home and moved across the country to be with my fiance'.  After moving to Arizona, giving up my promising job at one of the best new breweries in my area, and leaving all of my friends and family behind, I found my soon to be blushing bride not to be who  I thought she was.

Everything was wrong and I realized it 6 weeks into a new place.  I had found my fiance, the SheDevil as I now call her, sleeping with someone else.  As it turns out, she had been with him for the last five and a half years, and had been sleeping with him the duration of our two and a half year relationship.

I moved  home beaten down and alone.  I had given up my position at the brewery and my position had been filled.  But today I did something I hadn't done, but kept promising myself I'd do every day.  I got my ass up off the couch, did 15 push ups, 18 sit ups, and 18 squats.  I also ran 1.8 miles.

I know one day doesn't make a habit, neither does one week.  But realizing I can't commit to others who choose not to commit to me, I am now committing to myself instead.  Push ups, sit ups, squats and running every day.  

If I can do it depressed and 70 lbs. overweight, anyone can.  Keep pushing  




 Can't agree more.  Take it in to a local shop.  Ask other riders about good shops, maybe check out yelp.  I'd also recommend picking up a model and year correct service and parts manuals. 




 I vote you just watch the site and make an opinion for yourself.  If you don't like it, quit watching, I you do, watch it.  Do yourself a favor and stay off the sub.  People will fuck with you here, like subtly referencing Tig's fate. 




 I'm so I out of the reddit loop, didn't know this was a thing 




 I'm getting itchy to download some new music and I don't want to forget what to download while waiting for them to get back up and running. 




 So I recently made the choice to shave my head.  I'm going bald and pull off the bald and bearded look well.    I do however break out when I shave.  Most of it is on the site and behind the ears so visible to those around me.  When I don't shave I may have one or two if any pimples under my hair.  Any recommendations for a solution? 









 Meh, you can't expect much much more from someone who chose to be identified as "poopooslut" 




 Bless his heart indeed 




 I *sobbing gasp* just wanted a *sobbing gasp* division *deep breath* chaaaaaampionshiiiiiiiiiiiiip 




 I'm not disappointed in the Cowboys, quite the opposite.  I think they're growth this season was fantastic, including Jason Garrett's.  I'm disappointed in the calls, particularly the one, in today's game. 




 *sniffles* sometimes its good to cry *sniffles* 




 But he called a catch complete on the field.  NY replay office ruled it incomplete 




 Every replay I saw, the ball never got the ground.  But f*** it.  Still proud of the cowboys this year. 














 There's another app based program that is with looking into.  Is called 6 Weeks.  Its a conditioning program for push ups, sit ups, squats, dips, and pull ups.  Similar type of conditioning program as Couch to 5k 




 My ex has taken every single one of those photos, except you know, miss she's fat 




 Good being the key word 




 This is about the only way it happens.  Worked fur a dfw brewery for 2 years.  That's your only way in.  Be picky who you work for.
