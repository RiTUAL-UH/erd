 After reading this, I'm thinking all 911 operators should definitely be trained to recognize this situation. Even if it never happens in your entire career, the difference between hanging up on the "prank" and identifying the emergency is potentially the difference between life and death. Great work! 




 No matter how many times this video gets posted, I'll upvote it again and again. 




 This woman lives in Boston in shelters and is suffering from schizophrenia. She has posted hundreds of similar videos on multiple/changing YouTube channels. Every now and again someone posts one of her videos on reddit. Please don't mock her. She's living a nightmare and she's not getting the treatment she needs.

 Exactly, call SPCA, Humane Society, police. Most state SPCA's have investigators and all have relationships with police. In many cases SPCA and police can convince them to surrender the dog rather than face an investigation and potential criminal charges. Call today and could be remedied quite quickly, depending on where you live. (I live in Boston and the MSPCA is awesome at this kind of thing.) 




 whoa where'd he find that lady 




 If you want to give it a shot before buying a slow feed bowl, put a ball in the bowl. He'll need to move it around to get at the kibble.

Now, if it's aggression of the sort that he'll bite your hand if you reach your hand near him (try with a broom and a glove on the end), that's a real problem. If he doesn't bite, notice whether he freezes up or growls, because those are precursor behaviors. Any of this stuff, and you should consult an animal behaviorist. I'd recommend asking at your local SPCA or Humane Society, because they are very used to dealing with food aggressive dogs. The hand-near-the-bowl test is one that gets done with all surrendered or stray dogs, and it can be a deal-breaker in terms of whether the dog goes up for adoption or gets euthanized. They should know behaviorists who are used to working with people whose dogs have food aggression problems.

 An insightful interview with a man close to the center of regime power in Syria. 




 Fair, fair, you didn't say that. I also didn't say the market was the sole cause. The problems we face with health care are obviously very, very complicated. But it also doesn't make sense to ignore the multiple competing interests and parties involved in designing the ACA and in rolling it out when we say things like "the ACA is a disaster." 

I suppose I just don't see how we can have BOTH a for-profit health care industry and a governmental attempt to lower cost and spread coverage to more people at the expense of industry profit. The incentives are at cross-purposes.  




 You're right. We should probably just deregulate and let the free market take care of everything. 




 Be clear: for-profit, market-based health care is causing chaos, and intentionally causing chaos to undermine what the ACA tries to achieve. If only our elected officials hadn't given over one of the most important pieces of legislation in history to the health insurance lobby none of this would be happening. If we had a public option, which so many people called for and Congress + Obama failed to deliver, none of this would be happening. The industry is doing everything it can to make this roll-out a disaster. 




 This piece takes stock of Camus' legacy in terms of his writings on and engagement with Algerian independence and rights. It ends by comparing his writings on Algeria to the most recent Arab Spring. 




 Great piece on JFK assassination. Fresh, informative, and good job tracing the continued reverberations of that event through American culture. 




 Yes, thank you so much for doing this!!!! 




 Thanks, sorry not to include it!

 Type "freedom" to see your freedoms disappear. 




 This so so true and not just for student loans. Look at the entire subprime bubble. Predatory lending can only exist when the public has low financial literacy. High schools should be teaching some kind of "real world finance for your future" courses.  




 Right, you won't find most nobles elbow deep in the guts of an elk. Also, for a nobleman, Tywin is something of a self-made man, having rebuilt the House of Lannister after his weak father.

 Absolutely. Definitely a concern. The example of this kind of monitoring I can think of is CPAP machines for sleep apnea. The machine records your hourly usage, which the insurance company calls "compliance." Obviously, the clinical benefit is that you know whether you unknowingly take the mask off at night, for example, and your doctor can track how you are adjusting to the therapy. The negative is that if you don't meet certain nightly/monthly averages, the insurance company can decide to stop covering you.

It's about a blind blues singer named Paul Pena who heard Tuvan throat singing while listening to short wave radio, started doing it himself, and was invited by Kongar-ol Ondar, a famous Tuvan throat singer, to travel to Tuva (in Southern Siberia) to participate in a throat singing festival. It's amazing and so is the soundtrack. Here's Kongar-Ol on the Letterman show: [Kongar-Ol](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVyyhHFKI8E)
