 A) I don't watch porn in the shower I watch it at work, while I drive, when I'm on the toilet, when I'm in bed and when I'm watching TV and when I'm sitting on my porch.

B) I don't watch dicks but its hard to watch straight porn without noticing the main supporting actor just smashing away at the female lead.

C) I do watch dicks, dicks are awesome.

 Salt is the opposite of pepper and squirrels are the opposite of chipmunks. 




 And then your high horse breaks down on the way home and you freeze to death in the unforgiving cold in the land that the sun forgot. 




 Fun fact: all Pekingese have a similar yawn button located on either side of their face just inside the hinge of their jaw. 




 Pugs are the dog version of oversized sweatpants. 




 If I was a surfer I'd be insulted by this title. If I was a paddle boarder I'd be stoked, then I'd kill myself because paddle boarding is so lame and embarrassing.  




 I don't know what's more entertaining; the dialogue or the musical transitions between camera angle switches. 














 I disagree I think its way more unrealistic that super babe/Bond villainXenia Zaragevna Onatopp would marry a half-rate piece of shit Jedi who's only claim to fame aside from getting s3riously pwned by Darth Maul was being Galactic dickead Count Dooku's fuckin' apprentice.

Edit: OK I'm catching a lot of heat about the lefties thing; the bottom line is that when a lefty writes with a quill, they tend to smear the undried ink with their hand as they write, and that is a huge bonerkill for me. Deal breaker. 




 I've always heard that dogs were colorblind, but this confirms it. 







































 I can. I'm 28 years old I can say whatever I want. 




 I like to imagine all the marbles as being really excited they're at a theme park and running around going on rides.

 NSFW 




 Sorry for the vagueness and ambiguity but its 530am and I don't know why my brain just started to think about this but about ten or fifteen years ago I remember seeing this movie where this guy who is an increasingly shitty husband comes home to find a really fucked up video of his wife confessing to a bunch of fucked up shit like cheating on him and the video gets worse and worse until the end it actually shows her cheating on him on the video with his neighbor and then he finds out that its not a recorded video but a live feed from the neighbors place and he tries to kill her and or the neighbor or something. It may not have been in theaters maybe just made for/by HBO or Cinemax or something. Sorry/thanks.

 I dunno man I saw one on the Science Channel that can essentially print 3d buildings from locally acquired mineral resources, which NASA is considering using for building a moon base, and moon bases probably won't have to be breastfed, have diapers changed, wake up crying every night, and throw up constantly for the first year of their lives... 




 And that every straight guy age 12-35 walks around with a banana in their pocket. 




 Well, in the kitchen, women complain about doing the dishes, and in the bedroom they complain about having to make the bed and fold clothes, and in the TV room they complain about the TV being too loud or food being left on coffee tables; ergo, they need something to complain about in a bathroom that is otherwise dominated by their mess, so they use the toilet lid as their vehicle. 




 Baby pandas are in fact much more dangerous than adult pandas because their venom is just as potent, but as adolescents they haven't learned how to control the amount that they inject into their prey when they bite. 









 The 14 year old me was pretty certain you were supposed to pee inside a girl's bagina when you had sex, too.
