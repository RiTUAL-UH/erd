$9 shipped for this one.  Weighs items up to 500 grams in 0.1 gram increments. One reviewer says it even has an ozt mode.

I don't plan on buying silver larger than 10 oz bars so in theory this scale fits the bill.

Are you guys using these "cheap" digital scales?  $9 is hard to beat, averages 4/5 stars on 917 reviews. 




 I'm looking to buy (relatively soon) some generic rounds and bars from non-gov minters.  In particular, I'm looking for:

* 1 oz rounds
* 1 oz bars
* 10 oz bars (nothing larger and I might bail on this and stick with 1 oz bars)

From an eventual resale perspective, who are the most recognized minters out there with the lowest premiums? From another thread where there was talk of generics:

"sunshine, OPM, Johnson Matthey, etc."

All of whom I recognize. The point of this thread is to perhaps expand the "etc."  




 **Order placed, hand-delivering check/letter to post office tomorrow am** (check has to be postmarked one day after order). 

Went with cart 2a below.  When I went to actually place the order, they gave me two shipping options, one was $5 cheaper (USPS (Insured) - Priority Mail 2-Day Small Flat Rate Box) so I went with that. Total was $1,996.72.

I'll let you all know how the Amagi buying experience goes for me.

**Thank you for all your feedback**.

------------------------------------------

**Edit: See updated cart at the very bottom**

Would really love your opinions on this as a first silver purchase. I wanted to end up around $2,000 for this initial purchase.

Amagi Metals seems to have some pretty good prices and selection from what I saw out there.  **I would love your opinion on the prices below as well as Amagi in general (I do see it in the sidebar)**. 

For this initial purchase, I'll be doing a personal check. I don't mind a delay in processing/shipping, that's no big deal for me.

[I captured a screenshot of my cart](http://i.imgur.com/HeE2nOU.jpg) if the formatting above doesn't work well.

The shipping doesn't seem that bad to me. For some reason, I was expecting it to be more based on some things I've read here about people paying for shipping.  That price comes from their calculator as well, where you enter your state/zip. The shipping is:

* Priority Mail 2-Day Medium Flat Rate Box $13.70, USPS Insured.

 Looking at getting into silver investing and I've been researching some safes for storage at home.  I have stairs and don't really want to maneuver possibly 200 lbs up that by myself (and eventually back down). Don't really want to store it in my garage, either, though that's not necessarily a deal-breaker, just not what I'd like ideally.

Can anyone recommend a smaller/lighter type of safe to store metals in at home.  Something you're perhaps using yourself and are happy with.  And most importantly, how many ounces you think it could hold.  I'm looking to do coins/small bars, not sure if I'd ever go larger than a 10oz bar, I'm more interested in the smaller pieces for reselling way down the road.

I'd like a safe I can continue to grow into for years and years and years, not something I'll outgrow in a couple years. And I know I can't predict my buying patterns, just trying to plan ahead for storage. From what I've seen in pictures, it seems like a 2 cu ft safe would fit the bill, but I don't really have any real storage perspective for metals. I've never owned a safe before.

The 2 cu ft safes tend to be around 150 lbs, the low 1.x cu ft safes tend to be around 70 lbs, which is much more ideal from a moving perspective, but not sure how soon I'd possibly outgrow that.

Again, I lack that personal metal-storing-in-a-safe perspective.  For those using safes, what size are you using and how many ounces do you think you can store?

Any model numbers are greatly welcomed for googling. 



















 So I'm thinking of investing in some silver bullion as part of some diversification and have some dumb questions I'd appreciate any feedback on. Perhaps eventually add some other precious metals, but would just be starting with silver.

This is a local shop to me, http://www.ajpm.com/silver-bullion.html one thing I really like about them is they post the sell/buy prices so it's a little more illuminating from a financial aspect.

According to http://www.monex.com/prods/silver_chart.html silver is at 19.71 as I type this. That local shop has prices of (bull/sell prices and I'm doing some rounding for the difference):

* American Eagle 21.22/23.32 (difference of $2)
* Maple Leafs 20.22/22.82 (difference of $2.5)
* 1oz silver rounds 19.97/21.07 (difference of $1)
* 10oz silver bar 197.50/210.50 (difference of $13)

First off, are these buy/sell prices pretty normal from a percentage standpoint regardless of the spot price?  

Second, why would I want to buy anything other than 1oz silver rounds? With a $1 buy/sell difference (at least today), that seems like the obvious choice.

Again, total noob here, any input is appreciated.

 Noticed this game pre-order promo on my Steam client.  Did a youtube search, [found this game play demo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVlE8BXEbpE).

Looks absolutely epic, there was [mention in another game play demo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wNiiQpDPJE) video of 50 hours main story line, 50 hours open world.

Are the previous Witcher's worth picking up? I don't think I've heard of this series, though I'm not a big gamer. I'm a big fan of Skyrim, which this looks a lot like. 




 I'm looking to buy some raw land and I've come across some for sale that has a patented mine claim.  My understanding is that means you own the mineral rights as well as the land.

I'm not so much interested in the mineral rights, though it'd be cool to have them.  I'm more interested in the land having timber and a year round creek as I want to pursue micro hydro.

From some googling, it looks like the claim is for surface gold.  It also looks to be abandoned. Also looks to be yearly maintenance fees for the claim in my state, around $150.

The property tax on the land (from the listing) seems higher than I would have thought, given it's location.  Is this because of the mine claim?

Anyone have any experience with patented mine claims and any thoughts and/or gotchas you can think of? 





































































 These are the guys who did the first fold-up porch and interior stairs that I've seen in a tiny house. I definitely like their style by not doing the same old, same old.

* Should have built storage under the stairs, a lot of wasted space there
* Dig the big windows up top (for ventilation) and the ceiling fan
* Nice exposed beam ceiling, I've always liked those
* Excellent kitchen, though it should have a hood/vent fan over the stove/oven :(
* Awesome bathroom, though the sink doesn't seem that practical

Worth a look for you to steal some ideas.

I see models like this every now and then...Early 2000's, low miles (typically under 35k), priced in the low $20k range. Price seems pretty reasonable to me, but I'm a complete noob when it comes to stuff like this.

Anyone full timing in one of these?  Or just own one?  How is it working out?

Had these two emails come in last night, I've never had any phishing emails come in like this before.  Note the urls where all the links in the emails go (lower left of screenshots).

Also had an ebay email come in a re: a password reset (which I did along with paypal when the ebay hack story broke) less than 2 hours before the two paypal emails.  Kinda "fishy", but there are no links in the ebay email, so seems somewhat legit/harmless.  Funny thing is, when I go log into ebay, there is no password change email waiting for me in my inbox/messages.  There is a "password update"  at the very top utility nav but one would think they'd also send an internal email to user's inbox.
 







































 Looking for cheap PC steam games to check out so I seek out sage advice.

What are some of yesterday's/yesteryear's biggest titles available on steam that can be picked up for cheap nowadays? Really interested in the games you can play over a long period of time as I tend to focus on playing one game for months at a time.

I'm a big fan of the more adventure type of games but I'm not a huge gamer so I'm out of the loop as to what is out there.

Big bonus points for those more "epic" games, like Skyrim which you can play for literally months and months and months. I'm actually still playing it, lol.

Online play, with a somewhat active community would be awesome as well.  As an example, I played DayZ (pre-alpher) pretty much non-stop for easily a year.  That was a great game once the big bugs were resolved.  Still haven't picked up the alpher, wasn't that impressed with game play/streams.  May pick it up down the road, dunno.

I'm on PC/Windoze 7. 









 We're migrating one of our old/large websites into a CMS and I'm trying to find the easiest way to automatically scrape every page and extract the html of a constant DOM node.

For example, let's assume this standard page markup:

    div id="masthead"logo and masthead crap/div

    div id="leftnav"left nav items/div
    
    **I want to extract all the markup within this "content" div, all the div's child nodes**
    div id="content"
        h1page header/h1
        pbody copy/p
    /div
    **end of div I want to extract**

    div id="sidebar"promos 'n shit/div

    /div id="footer"almighty copyright/div

I want to be able to feed it a list of urls (which I don't think will be terribly hard to generate) and end up with separate .txt files with the extracted html.  So assuming I have the following urls:

* http://www.mydomain.com/index.html
* http://www.mydomain.com/contact.html
* http://www.mydomain.com/about/index.html
* http://www.mydomain.com/products/catalog.html
* http://www.mydomain.com/foo/bar/baz.html
* etc.

I would end up with the following .txt files:

* http://www.mydomain.com/index.txt
* http://www.mydomain.com/contact.txt
* http://www.mydomain.com/about/index.txt
* http://www.mydomain.com/products/catalog.txt
* http://www.mydomain.com/foo/bar/baz.txt
* etc.

The urls I feed it essentially become the names of text files for that 1-1 mapping thing. The contents of those .txt files would be the markup within the div id="content"/div for that file name/url.

What's the easiest way to automate something like this?  We have hundreds of files.

Node and PHP would be viable options for me.

I'm on Windows 7.

 https://www.ng-book.com/

Looking for some resources for other front-end devs to jump into Angular (who have no prior experience). Wondering if anyone here has read this and what your thoughts are. 





























 Hi all,

**Edit: Great answers, guys, pretty much told me all I need to know. Thank you!**

First, if this is not the right subreddit to be posting to, please let me know where you think it should go.

I'm wondering what issues/considerations there are in upgrading to a 4k monitor for PC gaming.  Amazon has a [39" Seiki Digital for $500](http://www.amazon.com/Seiki-Digital-SE39UY04-39-Inch-Ultra/dp/B00DOPGO2G/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1397142217 sr=8-1 keywords=seiki+39+4k).

I had a custom PC built just over 2 years ago, checked the invoice to see exactly what video card I have (which I would imagine would be the primary consideration?), which is:

* Sapphire Radeon HD6950 2G 100312-3SR

I can't say I have any performance complaints with the games I've played.

I'm not really a hardware guy, so I don't really know much about this kind of stuff. I had a local shop do the build and I think they did a great job with the specs and price.  Figured I'd post this question here as I'm sure there are tons of really knowledgeable folks who have possibly already gone down this road. 


































 Let's pretend we have the following scenario.

We have a widget, it could be any widget, but let's just say it's a zip code widget where the user enters their zip code and they're served up custom content based on that zip code. Within this widget they can edit their zip code or clear it.  They get some basic validation/feedback on input entry as well.  For example, an error message if they don't enter 5 digits (just think like really basic form validation).  The key to the widget here is it's interactive.

How would you guys go about unit testing this widget in the most automated fashion?

Now let's say we want test that widget in a more integrated/end-to-end manner.  So let's say you want to test firing up the site/app, enter a valid zip code, possibly check to see if the right content is displayed (assume there would be some hook in place for this, like a id that equals the zip entered), navigate somewhere else, maybe navigate again somewhere else.

How would you guys go about testing this flow in the most automated fashion?

Also assume the scenario is you're integrating testing after the site/app is built and launched.

What are you guys doing to ensure some semblance of code correctness as you maintain sites/apps? 














 This is coming down the pipe for me and I'm sure our marketing department is going to have many "creative" ideas for how they want it to look.

I'm trying to gather some urls that have a google custom search integrated so I can check them out to see what sort of patterns tend to be in place.  This way I can share this info with marketing and in theory, the whole design/dev process should go smoothly?

If any of you guys have implemented a google custom search (the paid version, not the free version), I'd love it if you could share some urls.  And/or just your experience with integrating it into an existing custom site. 
































































 Anyone know of a web based tool like http://geopeeker.com/fetch/?url=www.yahoo.com which allows you to test how a site looks based on geolocation lat/long coordinates you provide?

I'm looking for something where you enter a site url and then enter some lat/long coords you want to test.

In particular, I'm looking for a testing tool for non-savvy folks.  I know about chrome's emulate geolocation coords within dev tools. 














 I commute on a train 2 hours every weekday and I read during the ride.  I just downloaded [White Noise Lite](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tmsoft.whitenoise.lite) but the audio shuts off when I switch to my reader app.

Basically I'm trying to drown out train environmental noise by listening to white noise.

What's the easiest way I can do this? I want my audio app (which may change in the future), when playing, to be minimized so as not to obscure my reading app.  Ideally, it's not a ton of taps/swipes to get everything open/playing, either.

Do I need a multitasking app?  If so, any recommendations?

I'm running Android 4.4.2

**Edit**: Just coming back to say that [Chroma Doze](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.pmarks.chromadoze) fits the bill quite nicely.

These were the first guys I saw that did a fold up porch.  Might have been the first I've seen that actually did stairs as well.

* "Escape hatch" fire escape.  Surprised I don't see more of these, I think this is the first one I've seen.  Seems like escape windows would be more prevalent?
* Nice staircase storage
* Nice loft headroom
* Cool opening skylight 









 Not a huge gamer here so I'm calling on your expertise.  Skyrim is absolutely gorgeous, it still blows my mind how beautiful the scenery is.  I find myself walking instead of fast traveling between destinations simply due to the scenery.

Also, the free roam/discovery aspect is amazing as well.

Lastly, you start talking to people and before you know it, you have 10 quests/tasks queued up.

It's absolutely epic and I'm looking for other games in the same vein.

Available on Steam would be ideal.

PC here.

Whatcha got for me? 
























 As if the full screen images weren't bad enough (IMO), they seem to have this awesome feature now where [you can't copy/paste text](http://i.imgur.com/w0GlxO8.jpg).  Sure, you can use a web inspector, but that seems ridiculous to me.

You can see this at https://medium.com/life-learning/2a1841f1335d 



















 Remember how the geolocation override used to be right under Chrome Dev Tool's gear icon overrides section?  I don't know when it moved, but it moved. Took me about 15 minutes to find where it moved to.  It's now in an emulation tab in the "drawer".  Here's how to find it.

http://i.imgur.com/ek2OYkr.jpg

* Go to the settings/gear icon "Overrides" section
* Click/enable the "Show Emulation view in console drawer"
* To open/close this drawer you can click the = icon next to the gear icon or hit the Esc key
* Go to the "Sensors" section of the "Emulation" tab
* Happy geolocating 














 Hello all,

Looking for recommendations for a charging station/unit for AA NiMH batteries.  Anyone have units they can recommend that I can buy online?  Looking for both a charging station and AA batteries.

Thanks! 





























 My current auto insurance is up for renewal and I'm thinking of making the jump seeing as I just don't drive that much.

The rate quote I'm getting online is $20/month + 2.2 per mile. Currently paying Nationwide $85 month.

Has anyone signed up with MetroMile? Did you find the rate quote accurate? Any hidden gotchas? Have you had to file a claim? If so, how did that go? What are your overall thoughts on switching to them?

 Hello realtors!

I'm looking to do some interior work on my condo (built in 2000) and would like some opinions from a realtor/selling point-of-view.

I have the original interior paint (white and off-white/eggshell) and original carpet (still in good shape, but showing some wear) but I'm wanting to repaint the interior and either put in new carpet or some type of laminate flooring (that looks like hardwood).  I have pergo in my kitchen and just love the low maintenance and looks.

What are your thoughts on color schemes for interior paint?  If you have any photographic examples of more safe color schemes you'd recommend, that'd be awesome.  What I mean by "safe" color schemes are those from a selling point-of-view.  I don't want to have to repaint when it comes time to sell (which is not in the immediate future).

What are your thoughts on doing some type of laminate -vs- just re-carpeting everything? I'm thinking of laminate everywhere except the bedroom, which I would re-carpet.

Any and all input is greatly appreciated! 









































































































































































 Posting for a friend because he's new to reddit and doesn't have enough karma to get his questions listed here...I'm acting as a proxy here.

[What do you guys think of this safe](http://portland.craigslist.org/yam/bfs/4733117842.html)? He's looking for a safe to store precious metals in, possibly up to $40k. He doesn't have the metal yet, he's just looking to get into metals for some diversification. Step 1 is getting a safe.

From his research, here are a couple links to the current model # (SB02):

* [http://beseenontheinternet.com/vasafeandlock/centurion_sb02.htm](http://beseenontheinternet.com/vasafeandlock/centurion_sb02.htm)
* [http://easternsecuritysafe.com/Products/homesafes/liberty.htm](http://easternsecuritysafe.com/Products/homesafes/liberty.htm)

Additional info he gathered from the seller:

*from the back plate  MDL# CNSB02.   There is a plate inside the door that reads: passed 2hr, 1000degree, heat endurance test, drop test   reheating test   gives the test standards #. I couldn't find a weight tag but I have moved it once-my best guess is about 250# -300#.  It is a great safe I bought new in 1995 or 96 to keep papers, etc, in.*

Neither of us are terribly knowledgeable about safes and what would be a good one for his needs so I'm wondering what you experts think of this one.  We both look on craigslist regularly but pickings (for what we think he needs) seems pretty slim. 




 [I recently ordered 20 Perth Lunar II Series but they didn't come in the mint roll](http://www.reddit.com/r/Silverbugs/comments/2jmme3/would_this_bother_anyone_else/). If you ever find yourself in this situation (and you're annoyed by the stacking inconvenience), or you just want to tube up some loose Lunars you might have, this thread is for you.

What you're looking for are **"I" Cap-Tube Holders**. The Lunar capsules are a little loose in these tubes, but it isn't bad or annoying, IMO. It's certainly more convenient for me to have them tubed than loose coins.

You can [fit 15 Lunars right up to the rim of the tube](http://i.imgur.com/gQJuAUW.jpg). With the cap on, it seals fine. 

You can also easily [cut the tubes down so you can store 10 in a tube](http://i.imgur.com/EUjj3eJ.jpg).

I picked these tubes up on ebay from the seller **onfireguy**, I'm not sure if ebay links are allowed here but you can just do a google search for "onfireguy ebay" and it'll come up as the #1 result. Ships out very fast. 

 



















 The gold to silver ratio is approximately 71:1.

I've had gold on my end-of-year goals but with the ratio it seems it's a better time to buy silver.

Anyone else in the same boat?  What are you doing? 




 [The 1 oz series on APMEX](http://www.apmex.com/category/14500/gold-lunar-series-1-1996-2007/all?f_productoz=1+oz page=1)

* Horse @ $1,538.90 mintage 30k
* Snake @ $1,363.90 mintage 30k

The rest have lower mintages so I can understand the fluctuation in prices there.

I've also noticed this [Series II Snake for $1314 over at Bullion Exchanges](http://bullionexchanges.com/2013-1-oz-gold-lunar-year-of-the-snake-perth-mint-series-ii-coin-in-capsule.html). Great deal as it's [$1414 at APMEX](http://www.apmex.com/product/71321/2013-1-oz-gold-lunar-year-of-the-snake-bu-series-ii).

What do you guys think?

 









 If you order [20 Lunar Snakes, which are advertised as 20 per inner pack](http://www.apmex.com/product/71339/2013-1-oz-silver-australian-year-of-the-snake-bu) and [they come like this](http://i.imgur.com/4s2pbVA.jpg).

I somewhat recently ordered 25 of the Canadian Grizzlies, I believe it was and they didn't come tubed properly, either.  I had to contact them to send out a tube and then remind them it should be a wildlife (blue) tube.

I store silver in a safe deposit box so stacking efficiency is pretty important to me. 







































 Would like to send a sample of rain water off to be tested to see what sort of heavy metals it contains.  Has anyone ever done this or know of a lab that can do this?

Obviously I'm interested in the geoengineering aspect of testing the water. 





























 Their current [terms and conditions](http://pastebin.com/Dt3LzDum) state:

*Credit card or electronic check (ACH) orders for any amounts are processed through security screening.  Failure to provide accurate Social Security Number (SSN) or Driver License information may subject your order to additional documentation or screening and, on occasion, require you to pay via bank wire in order to complete the transaction.  Therefore, we recommend paying by bank wire to guarantee timely completion and delivery of your order.*

I have zero interest in giving them my SSN or driver's license number after giving them my credit card. For those who have recently ordered from them via credit card, were you asked to provide SSN or drivers license info? 









 Part of my portfolio is precious metals but I acquire physical there (no paper).  What is the easiest way to invest in the falling price of oil? 


































 *Thanks for your recent order and your interest in Provident Metals.  We do sincerely appreciate the trust you've shown in us by ordering some precious metals from us.*

*I just wanted to reach out to you in regards to your recent order of RCM 10 ounce silver bars.  We were supposed to receive a delivery of these bars from the Royal Canadian Mint on September 29th.  Then the date changed to October 2nd.  And then to October 6th.  And then October 7th.  And finally, it looks like they're going to be here tomorrow.  In any case, once they arrive, we will stop everything else we're doing and we will ship out the 10 ounce RCM bars.  As an apology for this unforeseen delay, I will personally include a half ounce of silver in your order and give you free shipping on your next order.  To use your free shipping offer, please call in to one of our traders when you place your order.*

*Again, my sincerest apologies for any inconvenience this has been to you.*

*Kindest regards,*
*Joe*

I honestly don't care about the 1/2 ounce of silver or free shipping (I really don't).  What I really care about is the explanation.

It would have been nicer if they sent it *before* I inquired about the shipping delay and of course it would have been even nicer if, when I inquired, I was told this instead of ["We have plenty in stock"](http://www.reddit.com/r/Silverbugs/comments/2i93su/interesting_email_from_provident_regarding/). But I probably confused their customer service folks when I asked "Do you currently have the RCM 10 oz bar in stock? If not, when do you expect a new shipment?"

But hey, kudos to Joe Merrick, Provident's President/CEO for being upfront about the situation.

Can't wait for that magnet.

**Update** My order finally shipped out on 10-10. 














 From Provident's automated email that goes out with order status:

*Your order is in the queue to be picked and shipped. Nearly 90% of orders are shipped within 3 business days after confirmed payment and nearly 98% of orders are shipped within 5 business days.*

I rolled into that lucky 2% today (5 days past "confirmed payment") and inquired about when they think my order might ship out.  This response came in this evening:

*We apologize for the delay. You ordered a very popular RCM 10 oz. bar. We do not like seeing orders going beyond the 5 business days. I have put a free rush on your order, which will push your order to the front of the batch with the other orders that have a rush. We are doing our best to get these products out to you as quickly as possible.*

So it sounds like they don't have any RCM 10 oz bars in stock [even though they're advertised as being in stock](http://www.providentmetals.com/10-ounce-rcm-royal-canadian-mint-9999-silver-bar.html).

So if anyone has ordered any RCM 10 oz bars recently, you might be seeing a shipping delay from Provident.

Pretty disappointing, but on the bright side I'm sure they'll throw in a magnet with my order.

**Update:** When their email came in, I replied asking if they had the bars in stock.  This was their reply that came in last night:

*We have plenty in stock. We are shipping out orders in the order they were placed into confirmed payment. We expect your order to ship early next week going off of the number of orders in front of your order.*

I ordered two bars, still seems odd why there would be this big shipping delay if they have plenty in stock. I mean how long does it take to pick and pack an order from their warehouse? On the price dip I'm sure their orders are up and maybe that's coupled with staffing issues, who knows...Still seems a bit fishy to me.

I also love the fact they gave me a "free rush" which costs nothing. I mean, you can't buy a rush order.  Not free shipping (credit) for the next order, a "free rush" in the queue, lol. 














 Spot is $16.73 as I type this.  Who is not buying now and why? Are you worried it's going to drop to $X? Are you a short-time flipper?  What's your silver strategy and your buying psychology/rationale today?

http://salem.craigslist.org/spo/4676467207.html

I'm looking at this safe which is somewhat local to me (about an hour away) and I'm trying to determine the make model number so I can do some online research. The point is to determine whether it's worth the trip to go look at beforehand, as it's "somewhat" local to me. If it were in the same town, I'd just go take a look.

When I asked the seller if he knew the make/model #, he replied with:

"The # on this safe is a sticker. It reads 702 in big bold numbers and 10247 in smaller font."

I don't seem to be having much luck via google.

Does anyone have any idea what make/model this might be? I was hoping for a serial # as I imagine if I called American Security with that, they would have a record of what type of safe. Seller can't seem to locate any other markings.

*These are the only other identifying photos he could get from the seller:*

*http://imgur.com/a/RXxgy*

*The safe is reportedly 15-20 years old.*

For those that were in the game back then, how was the market different back in 2010/2011? Gold and silver have made 3 recent attempts to run up. 
























 http://imgur.com/a/YMEEA

[And JM Bullion has them for $632 with free shipping](http://www.jmbullion.com/1-kilogram-johnson-matthey-silver-bar/). Cool piece to add if you're looking for a kilo - great time to pick one up. 









 I'm doing some window shopping at Scottsdale for a possible purchase on the dip.  I have a loaded up shopping cart and I'm in the checkout section now.

The payment method is either:

* Bank wire transfer
* ACH (electronic funds transfer)

I have the ACH selected but it isn't giving me any info for what that ACH info is for paying online.

I'm looking at a screen with my shipping address, payment method, order summary and a "submit order" button.  I don't really want to just blindly click the submit order button.

Has anyone gone through this?  How does the ACH option work through their shopping cart? 


































 Being tapped out in the silver fund$ department.  Oh sure, I could reach into savings and place some orders, but the reason I can reach into savings and place some orders is because I have financial discipline.

Please....Spot price, for the love of God, please keep going lower through next payday.  And you know what I want you to do?  Stay there for awhile. Think about renting a nice condo with a view.  Hang out a while, I'm a great neighbor, we can do brunch. 



















 Cuz I just received a shipping notification indicating UPS whereas every other order I've done has been via USPS.  It isn't like my order is really large, either, it would definitely fit in a medium flat rate USPS box.

I hate UPS deliveries, they are incredibly inconvenient for me to have to go pick those up.

**Update**: Tracking number shows delivery this Friday.  UPS.com shows the customer center isn't available for a Saturday pickup and they're only open for a pickup M-F until 6pm.  I can't make this time as the god damned customer center is over 20 miles away (one way). No way I'd make it in rush hour traffic. This means I have to take Friday off to sign for my package.  Thanks Provident.  So now every order I make through them I need to contact them beforehand to find out if they can ship USPS.  Looks like I'm done with Provident. 




 [Nah, I'm just fucking with you, it just dropped under $19](http://i.imgur.com/YXE0mWP.jpg)

[I picked up a tube of these 1 oz Heraeus, they're hot!](http://www.providentmetals.com/heraeus-1-oz-silver-round.html)

What are you guys ordering? 




 Tossed some stuff into my cart last night, wanted to do an order this morning so I can send it out certified mail today (like within the hour).  Not getting any styling in my shopping cart, just the html output.

Anyone else getting the same thing? 














 Silverbug search for "Midwest Bullion Exchange" and "privatebullion.com" aren't showing any results.

A [tube of 2014 Kooks](https://www.privatebullion.com/product/2014-1-oz-silver-kookaburra/) (20 count @ $25.69 per coin) can be had for $528.80 shipped. 

They look to take personal checks as well, which is all I do (for the $ discount).

Anyone done business with these guys before? 




 Wondering if prices on higher premium items (like Lunar Series, for example) would be good to pick up on the dip, or if those prices are remaining pretty steady.

What do you guys think?  What are some non-generic deals out there now?

 Looking at picking up a couple ATB 2014-P coins.  US Mint doesn't seem to indicate which carrier they use to ship, just that:

The United States Mint selects from a number of carriers to deliver your package.

It looks like I'm getting the expedited shipping (because I am such a high roller):

Orders with Merchandise valued at $300 or more with a standard delivery option chosen will receive a complimentary upgrade to Expedited Shipping.

I really would like this to come USPS as that is so much more convenient for me. Anyone have any recent ordering experience from the US Mint? What carrier was used and what was the shipping method? 




 If you have anything sitting in shopping carts, now would be a good time to buy. 









 I'd like to pick up a roll of the 1 oz silver goats but I want to get them in the shrinkwrap roll.  I'm having a hard time finding the actual count for those rolls.  It looks to be 20, but can someone confirm this?

If I order 20, will I get the shrinkwrap roll?  I really want that for stacking purposes because it would just be easier.  I really don't want to end up with 20 loose capsules.

Anyone order any Lunar Series in those shrinkwrap rolls?  Is the count 20? None of the vendors on my list seem to really be indicating (like they do with tube count). 




 Who are the 100 oz bar playas here?  Why did you buy a 100 oz bar (or bar**s**, Mr. Fancypants)?  What are your thoughts on this today seeing as 100 oz bars can be had for $2k...Would you do it all over again or take that 2k and spread it around?  If the latter, what would you drop that 2k on?

If you once had your 100 oz big boy pants and sold, how hard was it?  Where did you end up selling? 




 http://www.apmex.com/product/81490/2014-1-oz-gold-canadian-howling-wolf-99999-fine

The howling wolf is the **first release** in the Royal Canadian Mint's new 'Call of the Wild' series. 

What do you all think of this -vs- a gold eagle/buffalo/maple/krug/et al? I'd like to get an ounce of gold by years end and I've been spying this.  Seems like there might be some increased premium/collector value over time compared to standard 1 oz coins?

I'm thinking start with this one and hopefully keep up with the other releases...A save the whales, collect the whole set thing. 



















 From my regular vendor list, Provident has them. APMEX and Monarch have spotted ones, though Monarch doesn't have enough for a tube.  I figure if I'm going to get them (they have a higher premium) might as well spend a little more to get higher quality.  Anyone know of any other online vendors (that take personal checks) that have tubes of 2012 1 oz Canadian Moose? 









 Not talking about new/mint-direct stuff. If you or I were to sell a couple 10 oz bars, a tube of generics or gov-backed coins, *whatever*, to APMEX, Provident, JM Bullion, Monarch, et al...What do they do to verify that silver before reselling it?

In other words, when you or I buy that "secondary market" silver, how do we know it's been vetted? 









 http site is up (shop), but https (user account) seems to be hosed at the moment? 














 At the moment, spot is:

* $19.46 via [silverprice.org](http://www.silverprice.org) (this is the main site I use for spot price)
* $19.44 via http://www.monex.com/liveprices/

[SD Bullion](http://sdbullion.com/) is currently listing spot at $19.70 (and I've refreshed a couple times)?  It isn't like spot is spiking up over $19.50, either and I'm just seeing a delay in the price. 

Wassup with dat? Are vendors listing spot at spot + X? I noticed when I purchased from Monarch they seemed to always list spot around 4 cents over what I was seeing elsewhere.

Just so you know I'm not bullshitting, [here's a cropped down screenshot of two separate browsers, refreshed at 7:28am](http://i.imgur.com/puGOW4r.jpg) 




 * What was spot when you sold?
* How much did you get per oz?
* Was it difficult to sell?
* How many ounces did you sell?
* What in particular did you sell (i.e., generics, bars, gov-issued coins, etc)?
* What sold for the most?
* What sold for the least?
* Was any item refused (i.e., a 100 oz bar)?
* Where did you end up selling?

Curious what some real-world selling experiences were back around the recent peak.

 Don't see mention of [SD Bullion](http://sdbullion.com/) much here, wanted to give them some praise.

My second order with them came in today, I ordered the [new 10 oz RCM bar](http://sdbullion.com/silver/silver-bars/weight-10-oz/10-oz-rcm-silver-bar-9999-fine-reeded-edge-serial-number) which they're selling for $214 right now.

Let me break down the time frame on the order:

* Placed my order the evening of July 24
* Mailed out **personal check** on July 25
* My cashed/processed check showed up in my online bank account on July 28th
* They sent my "order shipped" notification on August 1st
* Delivered on August 4th

This was advertised as a pre-order that would not ship before August 14th as well. 




 I'm looking to order a full set of Koalas from APMEX tonight.  They look to run from 2007-2014 and all years look to be in stock.  Each Koala detail page indicates they're in capsules and have a diameter of 40.6 mm.

I'm assuming all the diameters listed are really the capsule's diameter?  I ask because I'm looking for a tube to put them in.

I don't really like [the tube APMEX has for sale that says it's fits 40 mm](http://www.apmex.com/product/15341/sure-safe-silver-coin-container) (though it doesn't say 40.6mm).

I like [the tube Provident has for sale](http://www.providentmetals.com/cap-tube-for-airtite-coin-holders.html) which says it fits 40.6 mm.

The Provident one should work out, yes?

Are you guys using this? If so, what size are you creating your master favicon file that you upload?  Not all the dimensions in the generated code are divisible by 16.  Should I just create the master favicon at 320x320 (which is divisible by 16)? The generator site says your file should be at least 260x260 (not evenly divisible by 16).
 



















 Do the wealthy stack? Or is it mostly middle-class? Thoughts? 




 I've 40k left on my mortgage, which I can pay off in one fell swoop. I've thought about doing this for a couple years now but I also think about my mortgage being "good debt", if that makes any sense.

My mortgage is my only debt. Not planning on selling/moving anytime soon.

I think my interest rate is 4.25%, perhaps 4.125%, can't remember which.

Any 40k payoff would not be all my cash savings.

I would then take the monthly mortgage payments I used to make and just put those into my various retirement accounts (probably just split the $ up into even monthly contributions).

Thoughts? Anyone gone down this path or a similar one? How did it work out?

 I'm building a proof-of-concept app for a friend and I'm using YQL to scrape 3rd party website data/content.  YQL makes this so ridiculously easy I had it working literally in 10 minutes.

Started with two 3rd party domains and when I went to add another, it wasn't pulling in the content.  Looks like that content is populated dynamically, so when YQL goes to scrape it (via xpath), it doesn't return anything.

Does anyone know if you can do this with YQL?  I'd love to keep using it because, as I said, it was so ridiculously easy to flesh out a prototype.

Ideally, I want to bundle this up as a bookmarklet for my friend so it's ridiculously easy for him to use. 














 As it says on the tin, I'm looking to have my carpet cleaned.  I live west-side.

Can anyone recommend a kick ass company you've personally used, hopefully somewhat recently.  Also, how much square feet do you have and what did it end up costing you?  If you have stairs, did they charge extra for those?

Bad experiences are welcomed as well so I can make a note of those to avoid.

Thank you.

 Placed a small order with each back on 7/7/14.

Mailed out my **personal check** payments to each on 7/8/14 (Tuesday).

Silver.com attempted delivery was today, 7/16/14 (Wednesday).

Tracking on JM Bullion order indicates it will be delivered tomorrow (attempted delivery, anyways), 7/17/14 (Thursday).

I'll go pick both up this Saturday.

Pretty impressive for paying with personal check.

 




 Do you guys have a list of things your designer is required to provide when handing off designs for front-end development?

Things like color palette, link states, specific interactions, fonts (family/size), form validation, etc. Not necessarily just http://photoshopetiquette.com/ but similar.

What are you guys looking for when you get those designer handoffs?

 **[This is how I'm planning on documenting my silver purchases](http://i.imgur.com/S06myJH.jpg)**.  

Initially, I plan on doing it old-school style, i.e., a notebook I keep with my stack.  Basically I'm just going to document orders like the screenshot above and at the bottom of each page run a total of ounces and cost per page.

I was thinking of perhaps adding an **ordered** date and **spot** price columns. Not sure if I really care to track spot price as I can ballpark that via any generic purchases and the last two columns. Might be something to add, though.

I can average out my cost per ounce by month, quarter or year, which would probably be interesting to track over time.

I'd probably start a "sell" ledger when the time comes as well, document those there and adjust the purchase book accordingly.

What do you guys think?  What are you all doing?
 




 * [Great packing, arrived with no external damage](http://imgur.com/a/qVuvW). I think someone here recently had an Amagi order where a tube was cracked/damaged. I don't think this is an Amagi issue, but rather a USPS issue where their box got crushed a bit.
* 2 tubes 2014 ASE.
* 1 tube 2014 CML.
* Also in the order was a tube of Philharmonics, but [they couldn't fulfill those for me](http://www.reddit.com/r/Silverbugs/comments/2a6yqu/received_a_call_from_amagi_earlier_today_re_my/). I was really disappointed in their online inventory system not being in sync with actual product.
* A refund check is supposedly on its way to me now.
* On a scale of 1-10, I give this transaction, sorry to say, a 6. 

It does bother me that you order something they say is in stock, lock in a price and then find out they can't fulfill it.  I was hoping they'd throw in a note saying my next order with them will have free shipping or throw some trivial bone at me, but that didn't happen.

Overall, no big deal, but it obviously leaves an impression.

Their customer service is very responsive, though, I worked with Jillian there.  Gotta say, she was great.

 Via APMEX, **no signature required on the delivery????** That was very disappointing, is this the norm for APMEX? The order was for two 10oz Geiger Security Series bars, came to $453.20, is this below a $ threshold for signature?  Honestly, I think that's kind of bullshit...

Can't believe the size of the box these came in as when I opened it up, [I was a little surprised at the size of the bars](http://imgur.com/a/y1bi7). I thought they'd be a little bigger.

Solid APMEX experience except for the signature deal. 














 They can't fulfill my 2014 roll of Philharmonics on an order I placed on 6/22/14.

They offered to combine some years to fill the tube but when I order a full tube of year X, I want a full tube of year X (still sealed). They're apparently not getting restocked anytime soon, either. They also offered to exchange it for something else, but it isn't like I had time to go shopping while at work. Besides, I wanted those Phils.

They're sending me a refund, assuming it'll be in with the order, but I didn't confirm this.

Disappointed that their inventory system isn't quite so accurate as I was really looking forward to those Philharmonics.

Oh well, I'll pick them up somewhere else.

Anyhoo, I'll be sharing all my online ordering experiences, whether good, bad or ugly.  I encourage you guys to do the same.

 I'm on KitKat 4.4.4.

 Say for example, they're selling a 10 oz bar for $222.  Is it poor form to try and haggle?  Whether it's for one bar or five, i.e., "if you'll take $220, I'll buy it now" or "how about 5 for $1,100?"

I'm new to silver and have yet to hit up a LCS, I've just been buying online.

If so, would you recommend the one I linked up?

 





























 My second silver purchase, 40 oz, really nice online buying/checkout process. 

My first order was with Amagi, really nice online buying/checkout process there as well.  I've actually been quite surprised and impressed with my two online purchasing experiences.  They're pretty slick and I wasn't really expecting that.

I'll do a follow up post when the order arrives to relay the full experience.  It'll be a couple weeks as I'm paying by check, but I'll definitely follow up.

Oh, BTW, SD Bullion has good prices (for what I shopped around for/compared/bought) and they're running a $8 shipping on any order right now.

 I'm an old Apple guy going back to Apple IIe and I switched to Windows several years ago.  I have no plans of going back. My last Mac was the big aluminum iMac, I've had TONS of Apple computers over the years, I still have my SE which still works and my original candy transparent colored iMac which still works. The latter is worth nothing resale wise, the former I keep because I'd like to eventually do something with it.

Mainly, I switched because I didn't like that I could only buy what Apple wanted to sell me. At a premium price. With a PC, I can build/expand anything I want for less $. There's tremendous freedom in that. Also, I've never had a problem with Windoze. My first personal PC had Windows XP on it and I still think it was a decent OS. Still have that PC as well.  Used Vista for 2 years at a past job, didn't understand all the hate it got.

Enter code during checkout for instant savings. Only one coupon may be used per order. If multiple orders are combined into a single shipment with a single shipping charge, only one coupon may be applied towards that transaction.

 http://www.coinweek.com/education/coin-grading/ngc/coin-analyst-collectors-crying-milk-spotted-american-silver-eagles/

*Coin forums are loaded with theories from seasoned experts in the field. Many trace the cause of these tiny white spots to a wash the U.S. Mint is using. Specifically, the culprit appears to be detergent residue that isnt rinsed off before the .999-silver planchets hit the annealing furnace. As the cleaned silver planchets get heated to scorching temperatures exceeding 1,000F, any leftover detergent solution is inadvertently baked into the surface of the coin. The woeful chemical reaction between the baked-in detergent and the coins metal may take weeks, months or even years to surface.*

*As PCGS points out, milk spots indeed trace their origin back to manufacturing issues at the U.S. Mint. As much was affirmed by U.S. Mint Quality Division Chief Stacy Kelley-Scherer, who, in 2012, remarked that the white spots on American Silver Eagles are attributed to minting procedures. Unfortunately, Kelly-Scherer went on the record as saying that the U.S. Mint has not been able to find a panacea for preventing milk spots.*

*The Royal Canadian Mint (RCM) owes the milk spots on its coins to the planchet cleaning and preparation process...In short, RCM officials say they cant do anything about the spots*

 Picked up SOD for $5 (I think it was) over the Steam holiday sales blitz.  Pretty cool, but I have no idea what I'm doing.

I've basically made my way to the first home base (from the Ranger Station to the Church) and I've been free-roaming/looting the nearby buildings trying to figure things out. I'm not venturing out that far, I've hardly explored the map at all at this point.

I've built a couple things at the home base (an outdoor sleeping tent area and some sort of workbench) but I'm not sure how, or if I can even use them.  I think I'm supposed to reenforce the walls or something as well but not really sure.

I seem to be getting called out on a lot of stupid morale/fear missions where you have to talk to someone in your home base and then you just go outside and kill some zeds.  That was OK the first couple times but it sure seems to be a repetitive theme for me.

I've gone on a small number of missions.

 Hello,

Wondering what's out there in terms of a portable indoor heat source if the power goes out in the winter? Something that could heat a bedroom would be sufficient.

For those who can't light a fire, how are you preparing for winter storms taking out your power for a day or two or more.

A portable generator isn't really an option for me, either.

What is out there in the marketplace? 














 I was pricing an item out last night and was surprised to find Gainesville Coins credit card price not too bad.  Shipping, however, was quoted at $26 via USPS which I find quite rapey, to be honest. UPS Ground was quoted at $30 and I would have to pay for the privilege to go pick it up on my own time/dime (over 40 miles trip), so that's a no go for me.

Anyone know how they ship via USPS?  Is my order going to be put into a flat rate box? Typical 3 day delivery cross country?  I don't think I've ever paid more than $14.95 for shipping from any other vendor and that was for larger orders.

I've never purchased from them before as they don't take personal checks and I'm all about getting cash discounts.

 Yes, you're paranoid.

* They need to move inventory, that's the business they're in.
* They have sales, this part of the prior bullet point.
* You don't know what they paid for it.
* It may be a loss leader, i.e., it gets people to their site (new/recurring) where they buy other shit that has a bigger profit margin.
* Their sales have no effect on spot price, they would have to move massive amounts onto the market to have any impact on spot price.
* They are no doubt massively hedged. Spot could go down, sales could go down, but they could conceivable make more $ because they're hedged (they make the $ up elsewhere).
* APMEX has more Illuminati reptilians in shipping/receiving than in management. There is no conspiracy here until The Super Blood Moon Shemitah happens this September 23rd, thus the sign of Gozer's coming. WAKE UP!!! 




 I'd shoot my wife for $10. 




 Loads fast, works well. 




 They do not.

Sometimes price differences between the two sites are negligible (even with shipping charge), sometimes they're quite surprising. I usually load up carts between those two with the same items and then start whittling them down based on respective prices. Well, actually I do that across all my regular vendors. Instead of one order with one vendor I can end up with 2 or 3 separate orders with 2 or 3 separate vendors.  There is $ to be saved this way.

As always, you should do some price comparison before ordering.

 I would like to be faced with the problem of needing a box to hold 100 Geiger bars. 




 I can get a Mt. Dew with five of them quarters here at work. 




 Order enough product to fill up a box and you'll get a box. 




 [You have to admit, they're all pretty great](http://i.imgur.com/gPBbfhX.png). I'm not sure which one to go with...Decisions, decisions!  I'll probably hold a contest to see which one gets the most likes.

  a long-time client that has always been of the opinion that stock art available with a legal theme is boring

Bears are very smart and have been known to roll rocks into bear traps to set off the trap and eat the bait in safety. Smart like the legal team at Dewey Cheatum   Howe, LLP.

Canoeists have to keep their centre of mass low, so they dont capsize the canoe. Same strategy can be applied to tort law.
 














 How about a picture of a grizzly bear? Or if they specialize in maritime law, how about a picture of a canoe?

 Why is the Enterprise not in orbit? Also, it probably wasn't the best idea to put the torpedo tube in a flood plain. 




 There's been quite a few ASE deals on ebay since January. APMEX has had multiple auctions. MCM has had one as well. Also, Silvertowne had a deal on a tube of Buffaloes recently.

Maybe it's just me, but I don't remember many of these deals last year.  They're popping up like every couple weeks so far this year so seems like no big deal to miss one. 




 Out of stock.

 Shit, you're right, it's listed right on the page I ordered from :) Surprised the Wikipedia page doesn't have these mintages. 









 I plan on buying 1/5th of the remaining gold in the world to make luxury coffee mugs. 




 I just placed an order.

They're down to 8 as of 12:35pm PST, if you're interested you better act fast. Based on the comments here so far, it looks like 6 of them have sold in the past 20 minutes or so.

Anyone know the supposed mintage on these?  [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Silver_Panda) lists them as ?????.  Do the COAs come numbered in regards to the total? Something like 16,787 of 30,000. 




 Traditional combustion engines in automobiles are not going away anytime soon.

* Gasoline has the refueling infrastructure set up
* Gasoline refueling time is in single digit minutes, not hours, though I think the Tesla can recharge 50% in 30 minutes
* Gasoline has the driving range. I think hot/cold weather also compounds driving range with electrics
* Hybrids still have the internal combustion engine
* China
* India 









 It's naive to say what businesses should do because hey, MS *should* just use V8 and Webkit/Blink/Whatever...This whole Spartan is a waste of time, IE *should* be Chrome under the covers, right?

Have you ever worked in a really big, enterprise/corporate environment?  Choice is not a given. Your job is to support the business, which usually is far from Chrome Experiments.

I'd like to get you in on a conference call with Nike where you can tell them the problem is they're using a terrible browser and they should just install another one.  BTW, there are parts of Nike that are still on IE7. They pay us a metric shit ton of $ every year. 




 Come on now, that's that saying they claim it's always going to go up in price. Soon. Don't wait or you'll miss it. Buy now. The end is near, repent now. We take paypal. 




 Some people don't have a choice as to what browser they use, i.e., corporate lock down. Can't imagine you're doing real work for real business from 9-5.

 In all fairness, Arnold probably fucked that guy's mom. 




 Reminds me of [Scatterbrain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbLhHtaVIO4). 
























 Congratulations on earning my future business. 














 Impressive collection.

For cost he says he's in for everything on a per oz basis of $34.21. I'd be more curious as to what each year cost, not everything averaged out.

Also says total oz is 461.4 so he's all in for **$15,784**. 




 Is your order under $1k? 









 I recently placed an order and it was $hipped out UPS, which really sucks for me as it's a 20+ mile trip (one way) to go pick it up. And I live in a major metro area....And of course you don't find out your carrier until you get the tracking number.

I wonder if UPS is their exclusive carrier now. That would definitely be a show stopper for me as saving $20 on an order isn't worth the inconvenience of UPS. I doubt I'd ever save enough to make it worth my while. 




 If you're young enough to join the military, I'd recommend going that path.  Special forces.  It's definitely more safe than a career in front-end development. Also, you can frag your boss when the going gets tough. 




 Honestly, I didn't even know Michigan had the internet. Surprised CNN hasn't picked this up yet. 




 There is no perfect front-end code.  Front-end code is going to be touched by many people, with different levels of skill, under different time constraints, with incomplete requirements, documenting nothing.

Get used to it. 




 You're right, it's the seat back. I thought it was some sort of bigger separator.  Nice catch. 




 I can tell you that train is built by Bombadier, I think out of Belgium.  We have these in Portland (they have little manufactured badges inside), but we don't have them with the horizontal metal beam in the foreground.

That guy does look like everyone on the train, though. 




 Started with these last year, have a tube of 2014 and 2015. I'll most likely pick up a tube each year. 









 [Here are the worst of mine](http://imgur.com/a/orgQl) from a tube via the Silvertowne ebay deal. They don't bother me at all, they're just generic silver rounds. 




 One thing you need to keep in mind is the percentage change in silver to the percentage change in gold (per metric ton squared), when the latter has a causal influence on the former.

Think of silver spot price given in terms of differential calculus. In other words, it is a tool for measuring the responsiveness of one variable to changes in another, causative variable (silver to gold). Silver has the advantage of being a unitless ratio (excluding the troy ounce), independent of the type of quantities being varied. 

In empirical work regarding silver forecasting, you'll find the lows are the estimated coefficient in a linear regression equation where both the dependent variable and the independent variable are in natural logs.

You also need to factor in the percentage change in silver output induced by a percent change in silver input. 




 I'm glad to see this as my money is on radical Islamic fundamentalists being behind all the local missing cats. 









 I've been paying just due to the convenience factor. I'll take a look at taxslayer, thanks for the recommendation. 




  $17.50 each shipped which is still good.

Is it really for culls? 




 Not to steal your thunder or brag, but I have some quarters from like the late 50s. 




 But they know 78% of jQuery. 78%! 




 I've achieved my goal for a bullion position

Does this include gold, platinum and palladium?  If not, why not get a couple ounces of each? Or spend 2015 stacking non-silver? You could also spend this time to learn about silver numismatics. 




 Thanks, I'll check that out.

Do I need to provide electronic copies of my W2/mortgage interest/1099? 




 Yeah, I found some on retailmenot.com earlier as well. 




 Had to have been November 30th.  I bought a tube of the 2014 Libertads as well as a tube of the Canadian Bisons that Sunday night. I believe I ordered @ $14.72 




 I have pretty simple taxes:

* W2 wages
* Mortgage insurance
* 1099 misc income (from interest)
* No Obamacare
* No kids or any other deductions - as I said, pretty simple taxes

I've been going to a local guy for years but I'd like to save some $ and do them myself. He charges me around $100.

TurboTax and H R Block look to be the big players out there.  From my limited research, H R Block seems to get better reviews.  It looks like their Deluxe + State would be the best for me.

Some questions I have for those who have filed your own taxes online:

* Do I need to get electronic copies of my W2, mortgage insurance and 1099 that get sent along with my e-filing?
* If I need to print out forms, does something like H R Block Deluxe let you save those out to PDFs for printing? I don't have a printer at home so would want to be able to print it out at work. For example, if I have to pay state taxes, I don't want to pay to e-file that, I'd want to print out and mail my state return.

Any hidden gotchas I should be aware of?  I would have nothing to import from previous years, so this would be brand new tax filing for me. 









 Might want to invest in a collar there, toots. 




 What type of companies have you worked for?  i.e., enterprise, large/small agency, small software, etc. 



















 The best way to have $50k in gold and silver in this market in one year is to start with $75k. 









 Looks a lot more developed/modern than I would have imagined in 1890.  This is 30 years after Oregon became a state and the Civil War.

Looks like there is a street car in the lower left. The early ones were horse-drawn, which fits the time frame here, but there is not a visible horse in the photo, though it could be on the other side. Could also be electric as I think they had those pre-1900. 




 He was also extremely pro-gold before his Fed days.  **Before** he was the chairman, he heralded gold as being the true currency. **While** he was chairman, he denounced that statement. **After** he retired, he once again spoke about the reality of gold being the true currency. [Most recently that I'm aware of, speaking about gold at the Council on Foreign Relations, October 29, 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oz4-Tru_30A). 




 It looks like you need to buy 25 of the 25th anniversary to get the discount. This pricing may change this Wednesday, on the 25th (for the ultimate pricing trifecta), but that is pure speculation on my part. 




 Typically, dealers have a cost threshold that triggers signatures on shipping.  From my experience, that seems to be $500. 




 Their shipping charge is $7.77 on any order, lol. 




 Can confirm, when I add a tube to my cart and try to apply the redemption code it tells me:

This redemption code is linked to another eBay account 




 They're currently going for $53.28 each

Anyone else think a $10 premium for a [reported mintage of 9k](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertad_%28coin%29#Libertad_Silver_Series_.28Brilliant_Uncirculated.29_Minting_History..5B2.5D) is a bit much?  If the mintage were half that I could see it, but maybe it's just me.  What sayeth the peanut gallery? 




 Apparently within 4 hours. 




 Son, I got 99 front-end problems, but a few pixels ain't one of them. 









 Yes. It's also expected to fall in the next few years. 




 You're only $60 away from a kilo, check these out (come with free shipping), currently spot ask is $16.27:

 I've never worked anyplace where IT didn't mandate your "choice" of gear. Most of the time there is no choice.

I've never been able to pick out what I want, so I don't want to get anything too crazy/expensive

Fuck that, go crazy.  I'm sure you have to, or will have to, deal with a lot of bullshit at work.  Might as well have a nice system. Remember, monitors are cheap, don't skimp on your computer. 




 Can you do my front door if I supply a photo?  I just had a security door installed. 




 I've found the trick is to just write your css like you always have pre-sass.  There's something really magical about compiling a .scss to .css with zero changes in the input/output file.  I don't know how it all works to be honest, it's just ones and zeros flying around to me. 




 You could try calling Home Depot or Lowes, they have contractors they use for various installs of stuff they sell.  They might be able to give you a referral. 




 Would not be so bad if the coins were 5oz each.

 I'd contact APMEX and see what they say about how your orders were sent. 

http://www.apmex.com/faq

*How is my order shipped?
*American Precious Metals Exchange orders are shipped Registered/Insured U.S. Mail,   UPS. Each package is fully insured and may require a signature upon delivery.*

The "may require a signature" is probably determined by your order amount, which they could verify.

You could also be seeing a bug on USPS' tracking display.  If APMEX confirms they were sent with signature confirmation, it sounds like you have a problem with your postal carrier. In which case you'd at least know where the breakdown occurred and where to go to get it resolved in the future. 




 Only IF convicted.  I'm hoping we can throw in arson AND kidnapping as well. Might as well go for that felony conviction with some style. 




 You sure it was signature confirmation and not something like delivery confirmation?

Via https://www.usps.com/ship/insurance-extra-services.htm

*Signature Confirmation*
*Find out information about the date and time an item was delivered, or when a delivery attempt was made. Add security by requiring a signature.*

If it was sent signature confirmation and you didn't sign for it:

* Claim you didn't get it
* When they provide delivery information, ask them for your signature indicating you signed for it
* Get insurance $
* Send me 50% 




 Were you orders under $500? From my experience, this *seems* like the cut off for signatures for the big vendors.  I recently picked up a tube of buffaloes from Silvertowne via ebay and they were just left in my mailbox.  $340 order.

 I love this guy, definitely worth your time to explore his site and search for youtube interviews. 




 I thought it was fairly well known that Silvertowne was run by a sect of the Illuminati in concert with the banking cartel in their quest for a New World Order. We should get this added to the sidebar.

Ever wonder why the Indian is looking toward the right while the buffalo is looking toward the left? Think about it.

Also, APMEX are Freemasons of the Holy Royal Arch of the national Supreme Council, which explains their recent ebay "deal".

 Insulation has gotta suck on airstreams (walls are probably cold in the winter, hot in the summer).  You could completely gut it and spray foam insulate it, but taking it down to the shell and building it back up would be a sizable project.

 **I would steer clear of goldmart.**  I've ordered from them once.  **Once**...I really think they sell what they don't have in stock (like Amagi), despite claiming they have it "in stock, ready to ship".  I also think they drop ship orders because when my order finally arrived, it was covered in multi-colored stamps.  [Imagine this, but literally covered in different colorful stamps](http://www.sandafayre.com/stockimages/26343163.jpg).  It really screamed unprofessional to me, but maybe that wouldn't bother anyone else.  I really wish I would have taken a picture of it to post whenever I share my goldmart experience.

Goldmart was the lowest price I found, but I will never do business with them again.

[Silver.com is 40 cents more per coin](http://www.silver.com/2015-1-oz-silver-canadian-maple-leafs/) and I can't recommend them enough.  They're the same folks as JM Bullion.  They're awesome. Silver.com is the cheapest I found doing some quick price comparisons. 




 That's fucked up if you bought on the 10th like me.  I hit the BIN in the evening as well. 




 There are a couple with some tiny dings, but I don't really care as they're generic and they were like 10 cents over spot.  The tube ran me $340.01. Hard to say no to that, IMO. 

One had what almost looked like a diagonal score line across the back.  I'll try to get some photos up tonight, though sadly my camera isn't the greatest.  They'll go off to the safe deposit box Monday so if I can't get good quality photos tonight, the photos ain't happening :(

They look fine to me, again, generics, don't really care!

[**Photos of by far the worst two**](http://imgur.com/a/orgQl) and it sounds dumb, but they actually look worse in the photos than in person. Being generic as generic gets, doesn't bother me at all.  It's hard to photograph coins with my crappy camera....Subject matter is highly reflective, don't have the best lighting, camera macro isn't the greatest and the auto focus tends to do its own thing, sometimes half is in focus, half a little blurry. 




 [Looks like this is the auction](http://www.ebay.com/itm/2015-1-oz-Silver-American-Eagle-BU-Lot-Roll-Tube-of-20-SKU-86595-/141528111687?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0 hash=item20f3bb9a47).

The way ebay ASEs are going this year, I'll have a monster box by April, lol. 




 To be honest, this is how I think of all you guys posting here. 




 I know Silvertowne doesn't have the best reputation here with some folks in regards to their ebay auctions...I just wanted to post up [my tube of Buffaloes from a recent ebay auction of theirs](http://www.reddit.com/r/Silverbugs/comments/2vfkwa/ebay_deal_tube_of_buffaloes_for_34322/cohvcy1?context=3) was delivered today.

Hit the BIN on the 10th, in my mailbox/hands on the 13th.

Was my first Silvertowne purchase as well.

 




 "3% is normal daily fluctuations.."

This seems a little high for normal daily fluctuations, no? I would also think gold would be tied to it a bit more than it currently is today. Maybe it's just me, though... 



















 You could skype him and describe the designs using a puppet show.  I've found this strategy to be pretty effective.  My dog also seems likes the puppet show as well. You can spin that on skype as your dog being your business partner. 




 Yes sir.  They're my favorite generics and they were like 10 cents over spot.  A tube ran me $340.01, I think it was. 




 Design masturbation, there are no real security features. If you think the UV light is it, that is not real security.  Some nice illustrations, but design should solve a problem. 




 My order last night (of said Buffaloes) shipped out tonight from Indiana according to USPS tracking.  *My* ebay transaction seems to be panning out so far. 




 Did a Silvertowne ebay BIN last night, USPS tracking says it departed IN this evening. 









 Might be the 2-for-1 sale of Bolthouse Farms juices/smoothies going on at Freddies right now.  I know I doubled down on these last night. 









 The more you know. Thanks. 









 Can we link to ebay "deals" from the big vendors?  If so, can you all start linking directly when posting said deals.  If not, can you include the item # in your post so it's easier to find said deals.

Happy hump day. 




 have grown disillusioned because of the outpacing expectations/demands placed on their job

Yes.

Also, I've always found it incredibly easy to get (and keep) a job, but very, very hard to find interesting work and good project management. 




 Thanks again for posting this, picked up a tube earlier tonight. 




 http://www.bloomberg.com/quote/BDIY:IND/chart 




 Thank you. You are an officer and a gentleman. 




 Can you post the item #? I'm behind a proxy and can't get to ebay now. I might give this a go tonight, though ST doesn't have the greatest rep here for their ebay auctions.

 I used to work at Yahoo and I've seen David Filo many a times in line in the cafeteria (named "urls").  Wasn't the CEO at the time (Jerry Yang), but he co-founded Yahoo with Jerry.

 Did an [ebay BIN on a tube of ASEs Friday eve](http://www.reddit.com/r/Silverbugs/comments/2v1omp/if_you_love_ase_like_i_do/codqf7v).  Just got home from work Monday pm and there was a delivery attempt notification. This was literally coast-to-coast shipping as well. I wasn't expecting anything before like Wednesday, tracked the ebay shipping # to make sure it was the ASEs and the delivery attempt was indeed the ASEs.

I've only purchased from them 2x (both via ebay, both ASEs tube sales) and this purchase is absolutely bananas!

Bananas, I tell you.

 One thing I've done that works really well is to cut off the cat's paws. I recommend making the amputation at the metacarpophalangeal joint.

Afterwards, they don't really walk much, it's more of a sideways crawl, so they don't have much incentive to leave your property.

You might also consider fusing wheels onto their stumps so they can still skate around the house. If you have an RV pad you can turn that into a playground for them.  Climbing will be a challenge, though cats are pretty resourceful. 




 Without running the code on a machine, what do you think that it'll print? Justify your answer.
    
    ArrayProxy.prototype.computeSum = function() {  
        this.sum = 0;
        this.content.forEach(function(value) {
            this.sum += value;
        });
        return this.sum;
    }

    console.log(myArray.computeSum()) 

I can't justify executing code that someone can't be bothered to lint. 














 Wat? 









 Ever tried driving a train slightly drunk?

 I've purchased some tubes from **onfireguy**, amazingly fast shipping and is the first place I'll go when needing supplies in the future.  He has a ton of stuff, just google his user name, his ebay store will be one of the first results.  I think he has his on site as well (outside ebay).

* Do some bullshit coding - I have no idea what I'm even doing.
* Constantly rebuild this shit app not because I've fixed anything, I just like to see all that gobbledygook fly across my terminal. Makes me feel like I'm in the Matrix.

* 2:30pm cry.
* Rebuild the app several times in a row - I am the one.
* Check personal email, this time that recruiter email will be a solid lead, I'm sure. Hey look, a company 3,000 miles away is looking for a Java developer.
* 5pm get on train that looks like it's headed to Auschwitz. No one talks to anyone, can't even say "excuse me" when they need to get up or move. Their Bejeweled high score is appalling as well, fucking amateur hour.

You've just described their target audience. 




 I started my new Job as a Junior Web Developer this Monday, and so far its pretty good

It's only Thursday, bro.

The dilemma I have right now, is they program in many different languages with many different frameworks so there isnt a set in stone one to learn

Yep, jack of all trades, master of none.

My issue right now, is what I finished work I go home and have to do further programming to improve my Javascript skills, which does quite interfere with my social life

Yep.

meaning I do drift further away from friends

JavaScript is your only friend now.

as we often connect through playing Games together and skype, which I dont really have the time for now.

    if (life !== fair) {
        tears = true;
        tears.fall();
        delete fun;
    }

I am wondering how you balance your time, while learning new skills/starting new jobs

It all depends on the life you want. Do you want to make good $ and never have a problem getting a job?  Then get used to this because it takes a lot of work to remain relevant, especially when working on the front-end.  It's literally a part time job just trying to keep up.

The Role is mainly front end based for now, but they are keen to get my trained up in back end.

Of course they are.

 I imagine that's covering the increased insurance costs.

To some extent, yes.

* $500 order is $12.95 shipping
* $1,000 order is $19.95 shipping
* $2,000 order is $29.95 shipping

Do you think that shipping difference is mostly the increased insurance cost? It seems a bit much to me.

 I've never had them take more than 2 business days.

Two business days for what?  To clear a check/ship or ship once the status changes from "on hold" to "confirmed payment"? 




 I've never had shipping time issues with them, though I don't have a big order history with Monarch.  My biggest gripe with them is their tiered shipping raping structure. I mean pricing structure. The more you buy, the more $ you pay in shipping, yet they use the same priority mail/flat rate box.  In other words, you may pay $20 shipping and get the same flat rate box a $450 order would come in. You've just paid 2x as much for shipping.

Provident has the "worst" shipping times, from my experience.  I always pay by check, so I get hit with the literal week of clearing time for that.  Then, after that clearing week, the order switches to "confirmed payment" where it can take another 2-3 days to actually ship out.

Another thing to note is my last order with them, my check actually posted/cleared my bank the day the check was received at Provident. This is according to tracking delivery date and the post date on my check via online banking.  Same friggin' day Provident receives my check, the $ is taken from my bank. Which, in this day and age, is really how it should be, yet clearing time seems stuck in decades past.

 Correct, but he has to pimp the fact silver is "cheap" and the price of a coin is about the price of what it takes to mine it.  Sounds like a deal!

He doesn't explain what his metrics are, only mentioned First Majestic being around $14, then goes on to say conservatively cost is around $17.

Thank you and keep the videos coming. 




 Emergency fund = cash. 




 You have to piece meal it all together. jQuery and Knockout are libraries, not frameworks.

Knockout gives you two-way data binding.

jQuery gives you a x-browser abstraction for events, DOM manipulation, ajax and animation (high level overview, of course). 




 No back support = not designed for sitting. 




 This is why you keep receipts. 




 In theory, the benefits of everything that comes with either of those frameworks (MVC/structure, two-way data binding, SPA/routing, testing, documentation, etc).  I'm pretty adamant that right now is just the wrong time for us to do a new app in Angular given what we have to support. 




 We've actually used Knockout on a mobile app here, though it's a bit of a pseudo SPA.  I think what Knockout does, it does well, but it obviously is very limited in what it does do. 




 We have a couple developers here who are throwing around the idea of rewriting an ~ 2 year old app in Angular. It's currently a JSF (Java Server Faces app). I don't think Angular 1.2 is a very good idea at this time and I'd like to hear opinions/justifications by those much smarter than myself.

**We have to support IE8** (we dropped IE7 last year, so not very long ago) and it looks like this would mean we'd need to use Angular 1.2. This is a minor version behind the *current* release of 1.3.

I've read the Angular team plans 1.5 - 2 years of support for Angular *1.3*, but we most likely wouldn't be able to update due to needing IE8 support.  This, to me means we'd essentially be hitting production with a deprecated framework.

As for when we could drop IE8 support and have IE9 as a baseline, that's pretty tough to say.  If 1.3 is supported for 2 years, I would guess it might be possible to upgrade any 1.2 app to 1.3 in 2 years, but then we're back to upgrading to a deprecated framework.

Upgrading from 1.x to 2.x is also a big unknown at this time.  I've read that is an unknown upgrade path as well as the angular team plans to work on an upgrade path.  With the fundamental changes in 2.x, it seems any 1.x to 2.x upgrade will be quite a bit of rewriting, if not mostly a full rewrite.

So I could see it being yet another rewrite in a couple years, which seems a bit ludicrous.

We've never built anything in Angular 1.x, either.  I've done a personal project in 1.3 but that was just to go from reading about Angular to actually doing *something* in it.  This is not saying much as I read and play with a lot of stuff just to go from a 50,000 foot view to a 25,000 foot view.

I've looked at Ember as well, which looks like we'd be topping out (with IE8 support) at [Ember 1.13. They also claim an upgrade to 2.x will be "relatively simple" when you can drop IE8 support](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/45#issuecomment-93009469).

Ember looks like a better choice to me at this particular point in time, but I'd love to hear what you guys would do if you were in enterprise land, needed to support IE8 (for the next couple of years at least) and wanted to build some type of modern MV* app.

 Ajax (what $.load() uses) needs to be run via a webserver (not the file protocol) and you'll want to be loading files from the same domain, or else you'll need to look into CORS (cross origin resource sharing), which is a separate set of issues if you don't control all the domains in play. 




 I frequently see this from our back-end java and sometimes .NET guys, so I'm assuming the authors of that guideline came to the front-end via the back-end, i.e., they're your typical computer science guys.  




 Sure, just setup a partial html page that other pages can consume and use jquery's load method.

    $( "#elem-on-parent-page" ).load( "path/to/page-to-load-into-parent.html" );

If you only want to load part of the page-to-load-into-parent.html page:

    $( "#elem-on-parent-page" ).load( "path/to/page-to-load-into-parent.html #container" );

Where #container is just the parent element you want to consume. When you have a space after the url, it acts as a jquery selector so the above is loading page-to-load-into-parent.html then filtering it down to just the element with the id of container.

 I said this in a recent thread about the same question and I'm going to say it again...You should *start* with ES3 as that is what you're probably going to be maintaining. There is a metric shit ton of ES3 out there.  Once you feel you have a solid grasp, move up to ES5, then 6.

 Hi frenz. 









 and I'm now following up with scans of 3 of 10 coins I received

Since my original post I've ordered 20oz ASE from another vendor and all arrived without any visible fingerprints or other defects

I think this is key.  In your latter example you ordered a tube so you are most likely getting the coins as they left the mint. Some vendors may go through tubes and cherry pick what they think are the best to send out for grading but I think you have a much better chance with condition by buying in tubes.

What vendor did you purchase the 10 from?

 Are you aware the 2.0 version is not going to be backwards compatible with 1.x? There are major differences between 2.0 and 1.x. You might want to hold off until 2.0 is out before learning a framework (1.x), only to relearn it next year (2.0).

If you're just looking to do some sort of personal project in a JS MVC framework, I'd recommend Ember today. They embrace stability over stagnation.

If you're dead set on Angular because of the hype train, re-read my first paragraph and do some research on your own.

 I don't think those dates are critically important other than the PR angle.  I think they have something like 30 days or 6 weeks to make the payments before they are considered to be in default, so we're talking mid-end May. 

Sure, the markets will react if they miss the deadline, but there is a grace period for the ape to get ready.

Wonder if the bars are the style pictured or a variety. I know Englehard has several styles of 100 oz, APMEX usually has several varieties in-stock, though certainly not at this price.

 I've been using a local recruiter very successfully since 2008 (been placed 2x). Last time I looked around myself, [indeed](http://www.indeed.com/) seemed to be the best thing out there.

 I have a 10 oz Rarities bar, didn't pay too much of a premium for it.  Your 5 oz would probably fetch $100, IMO. That would be a "retail" price, i.e., to someone like the folks here. If you were to sell it to some type of retail establishment, you'd probably get $15-20 less, I'd guess.

I don't know if the 5 oz is particularly rare. I'd guess not so much but can't really speak with any authority. You don't see the Rarities bars much, but I don't think they're that collectible outside of being an older type of silver bar.

 I can understand this point-of-view.  I'm a big proponent of financial history, though, especially money and the institution of banking.  Don't get me started on The Federal Reserve. I won't even ask people about the 3 central banks that came before it in the United States.

Hey, look over there, Andrew Jackson, what a guy. 




 Not a ton of details, but I'd recommend checking out [knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/).

It's a MVVM library (not a framework), does pretty much one thing (2-way data binding), can be easily incorporated into any project and has a low learning curve.

I'd also recommend using knockout's mapping plugin which takes care of mapping your json data to your view model.

 Would like to look into adding some home security where ideally I can monitor via my Android phone. I don't know what's really out there nowadays but figured a lot you guys do and are possibly using it or can recommend what to look into.

BTW, I don't have a static IP address at home, but could probably get one. I go through Frontier. I don't have a land line (phone).

Basically looking for the cheapest way to add some security/monitoring at home.

 There's a faction here that thinks when APMEX has sales like this, it's foreshadowing spot price going down.

So let's watch what happens this week. We're at $1,189.40 as I type this on Monday eve.

I'm not finding any silver deals from them, though I'm just looking very quickly, filtering down to bullion--silver--uncertified--1 oz.  I see they have a tube of ASEs for $411 but not much of a deal.  JMB has them for $400 shipped at the moment. Silver spot is $16.82 at the moment so if I'm missing any APMEX silver deals, please post it up for the record.

 Or you are here protecting you investments. 

You'd be much better off, IMO, if you would have spent that $ on semi-numismatics.  With those generic APMEX bars, you're directly tied to spot price.  Take a look at the price of silver since 2011 - it has crashed.  What if you would have been doing your research then? Would you still have jumped in with the doom and gloom dollar collapse scenario that proliferates from the silver pumpers? Do you really think you'll find yourself in a silver barter situation?

For someone who has done a "ton of research" and "endless research", yet makes a large first purchase of generics, I'd say your research is failing you. I'm not bashing generics as I have generics, but you really need to be aware of what you're buying. Diversification can be fun, but that doesn't mean it will yield you the greatest gains.

I would strongly suggest researching and getting into semi-numismatics where your silver won't be tied to the spot price of silver, which may not have bottomed yet.

Welcome aboard the silver train.
