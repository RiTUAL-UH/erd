 Hello,

So far in my code i've set it up where I simply switch out my panels in my frame when I need to change what is shown on the screen. I've been looking at a few tutorials for making a 2D sidescrolling platformer game, but all of these tutorials start from scratch and i'm having trouble implementing them into my code. 

Could someone give me some advice as to what would be the best way to go about this that dosen't require me to rewrite my code ? 

http://www.mediafire.com/download/67iudjaxl5gfmmp/Game.zip those are my project files, if you need the actual images I can pm you them but i'd rather not make them public.

Thank you for any assistance! 



















 It seems like they made such an effort to make the gameplay fun, but completely ignored any type of level/team balancing. 




 I've been listening to Alan Watts, and one thing he emphasizes is the getting rid of concepts like the past and the future. Perhaps i'm still stuck on semantics but then when are memories ? My train of thought leads me to believe that they are always in the present, but it doesn't make sense semantically. 














 Hi, unfortunately one of the modes on  the Quick Fire TK keyboard does not include only WASD, infact you can't even disable the backlights at all. It's really distracting when they're on and annoying having to turn off numlock every 2 minutes to use the keys. Any ideas ? 




 A few questions, i've recently been listening to Alan Watts talking about meditation, namely Zazen.

 I'm wondering, do you keep your eyes open or closed ? I think I remember him saying that the monks would keep their eyes half open, as zazen's way is not to exclude any of the senses. 

When doing the crouching position, do you sit on your heels (it's a bit uncomfortable, maybe it's meant to be that way ? ) or do you turn them on their sides ? I don't have the round pillow, only a small cushion which I sit on. 

What do you concentrate on when meditating ? If someone could provide me a recourse or even better, explain it here, that would be awesome.

Thank's in advance. 



















 Has anyone here had any experience on living in a Zen temple for an extended period of time ? I've had a hard time finding any monastery/temples that advertise anything past 7 day seshin's.
Thanks! 



















 Hi, I managed to get the first one downloaded but whenever I get to about 500mb on the second/third zip files (of the large one) the download will stop, saying : unable to finish the download. Even if I try to download it manually and install it through NMM it still wont download all of it.

Any ideas ? 

Thanks in advance. 




 Cheers. 




 If it helps, i've fit a 6950 in there before. I'm using a CM 690 II and have a P67A-GD65 mobo. I'm currently looking at the DirectCU II model.

Thank you! 














 The sub plots are pretty silly, some of the characters are melodramatic and even the episodes can be a bit strange. But that's why I love it. It's such a good contrast for when they try to do the gut wrenching episodes such as when the doctor fell in love with Seven. It lifts some of the faux seriousness and in turn uses that to highlight the really excellent episodes and two parters. Thoughts ?  









 Looking to upgrade from my 6950 which i've been using for the past few years. I've already got an Accelero cooler on it (the card itself died) so either something that that would fit on or a card that comes with a built in aftermarket cooler. I've got a i5 25k@3.3ghz and 8gb RAM incase youre thinking something might bottleneck.

Thank you in advance!

EDIT : Sorry if this is in the wrong subreddit,not sure where else to put it. 




 Operating System: Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit (6.1, Build 7601) Service Pack 1

Mobo : MSI MS-7681

Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-2500K CPU @ 3.30GHz (4 CPUs), ~3.3GHz

Memory: 8192MB RAM

GPU : NVIDIA 9400GT

Speedtest : 33ms,1.4 mb/s dl, .65 ul.

I used to have a 6950 installed but that very randomly died, so i've had to switch to a 9400gt until I can get a better gpu. Ever since I have youtube videos, even when fully loaded, will randomly pause. I've tested this in both firefox and chrome. Any ideas ? 









 Anyone have any idea who won/lost what ? 









 Let's assume that you had 1 year to learn as many languages as you want, what would they be and why ?

 Since the next show is Tuesday can you please upload them before then so that we all have a chance to catchup and watch the live stream ?

I thought we'd have to watch the next one without the vods even being up. This is fine I guess as long as they're all up before the next one. 




 I always want to save my mana as ADC,mid or top. When can I use my mana to secure cs?  Is it always a better trade ? 














 Hi, regarding ability scores like someones chance to learn or fail a spell how do you work out if they succeed ? Say if it's 80% to fail a spell, do they fail if they roll a d100 and get less than 20% ? Or does the DM just decide arbitrarily ? Thanks! (I'm playing on 2e) 




 Hey,

So i've been watching a really awesome D D series called 'RollPlay' (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsFwQMjeWuo). I know that the DM is running on 2e. How hard would this be to get into with no experience of D D ?

 I'd probably be the DM for 2 or 3 other friends. Would it become pretty clear how they do it if I were to start out with 4e first ? I really like how it's more story/ 'theatre of the mind' (as described in the sidebar) rather than combat oriented (although the combat does seem a bit drab). Maybe it would be a better idea to go with 4e with a more freeformed gridless play like they did ? 

He describes in this post how he's changed the rules of the original 2e to sort of update it : http://www.reddit.com/r/itmejp/comments/196d2n/rollplay_wrap_up_for_week_2_campaign_info_plus_qa/c8lfeum

Cheers for any help or advice!

 Destiny is there any chance of you switching up your LoL/Sc2 for EU viewers like 3 days of the week (or even 1 or 2, just make sure we know them that we can tune in) ? I never get to watch any Sc2 because it's so late.  




 I really don't know much about US Politics but i was under the impression that it wasn't a religious country ? Did he just say that to appeal to the religious majority ?

 I remember seeing these quotes on the Newsroom, "As the government of the United States is not, in any sense founded on the Christian religion--" -John Adams (The Treaty of Tripoli)

"...that our civil rights rights have no dependence on our religious opinions.." - Thomas Jefferson

"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion." - First Amendment

EDIT : Just realized that the title might be a bit unclear, by a 'religious country' I mean not that the majority of it's population might be religious (which may or may not be the case, idk) but that the country is and always will be a religious nation, founded 'under God'. 














 Iv'e got an ATI ScanFX (UK brand) 6950, and I put an aftermarket Accelero Xtreme cooler on top of it because it was just making way to much noise and heat. It's on 1100mV Voltage, 800MHz core clock, 1250MHz Memory clock. 

When watching a 1080p movie the fan bumps up to 80% speed, and the fan stays at 90deg. Even on some older games like Darksiders 1 it ends up ovearheating (although I can run bioshock infinite on low for hours on end). My question is, is the fan speed/heat normal ? It's still pretty loud when it's on full load. Maybe i'm expecting too much. Thanks!

Also looking for some help to upgrade this some time in the future, made a thread on /r/buildapc (http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1bdzhe/upgrading_2_year_old_pc/) if any of you don't mind looking at that. 




 Hey, wondering what/when I should start upgrading my build ? I can only play bioshock infinite on low and i'd like to play that and other games like that on high in the future. My current build : 
Intel Core i5-25000k @ 3.3GHz (Never got around to overclocking it, how much would it affect gaming ?)

8GB(2x4GB) Corsair XMS3 DDR3 PC3-10

Coolermaster CM 690 II Advanced

1GB ScanFX HD 6950, PCI-E 2.0 (x16)

Accelero Xtreme 6950 Cooler

620W Seasonic S12II-620 Bronze

Gigabyte GA-P67A-UD3-B3, Intel P67

Coolermaster CM 690 II

Like I said I can run most games that came out in the past year on high/ultra, just want to futureproof for 2~ more years. Probably just looking for a better GPU, something like a 7979 or a 680 ? Cheers. 




 So what's the difference between OSL/GSL/GTSL/KeSPA PL/Proleague and WCS ? (Especially what's the difference between the korean ones ?). What's the difference between a season/yearly pass to GSL ? 

AFAIK GSL is just comprised of Groups A-H, and then they fight it off and then it's done, is that just one season then they repeat it 4 times orrr ?

 Should I buy a season or a yearly ticket if i want to watch it to the grand finals ? Thank you!

Edit : thanks everybody for the help 









 **N.B. None of the below means anything if this is just temporary and will stay temporary. The reason i'm making this thread is (as the title suggests) because I have a *lack* of information.**

 I think people will agree that his twitch chat is definitely one of the most entertaining things to be around or even participate in.

 Taking away the large majority of people's ability to chat is really off putting for me to be on his stream now. Now you can relate this to why he switches games, to get more money (At least afaik, maybe twitch admins are the real nazis?) but at least that doesn't hinder the actual 'experience' of being on destiny's channel (please stop me if this gets too meta edgy for you). It's so much more entertaining when he pulls of a crazy 1v3 and the whole chat explodes, retards and all.

Edit : In anticipation of 'why don't you just join raidcall', I want to be able to open his twitch page and directly talk to him. There's also the problem of annoying as fuck adverts (I have both of stevens stream pages whitelisted on adblock). mini tldr: practicality.

Edit 2 : Has anyone noticed how fucking boring the twitch chat is now ?

Edit 3 : Nice idea by Janeway, " Subscriber Janeway_ta: I am all for raidcall chat being his go-to chat. I think that's totally cool, it allows him the control he needs and gives people a way to talk to him. But censuring Twitch chat seems to me to be counterproductive. Rather than trying to enforce an artificial level of decorum in Twitch chat, I think he should just go completely hands-off twitch." I like the idea of having two chats, one that might have more 'decorum' as previously described, possibly not hands off but maybe just the Dharma bott to stop actual spammers. 

tl;dr Chat integral part of lay destiny experience. Back pls. #naziamerica #basedtwitchat 









 Just saw this post on the euw forums, http://euw.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=1098231 seems like somebody that's going to just make account after account to troll deserves an ip ban?? 









 I know there's a reading list however the list of pretty short and they seem like quite heavy reading. I was looking also for something a bit more focused on the problem of evil ? Or maybe someone could suggest a good introduction ? Cheers.  




 It's just a tad confusing but from what I can see it really depends on your standpoint, for instance, if you take up that all scientific theories can be reduced to being logically primitive (you can't explain the scientific law behind the scientific law behind the scientific law etc etc, it all has to be un explainable somewhere down the line) then I assume this makes it theory ? And then the standard pragmatist atheist would believe it fact because of the evidence ? 
Thanks for any help. 




 Hey, just wondering in what school/sub-school my viewpoint would fit in. The belief that God (or a deity if you will) created the universe, but does not interact with it in any way. So all he was there for was to create the universe, either he dissapeared or he might as well have. I would side with the standard deistic ideals but i'm not sure I agree that observing the natural world is enough to prove the existence of God.

I could be misunderstanding things whereas the whole idea of God creating the natural world means that he existed ? Not quite sure on that part. Thanks!

 Some games including Serious sam (the new one) darksiders 1, COD Black ops cause my PC to crash after about 10~ minutes of gameplay, first the video goes then the audio and I have to reset it to get my PC to work again. I'm on quite a good machine : 

AMD 6950 @ 1920x1080

i5 25k not overclocked

8gb ram

MSI-7681

DX11, latest graphics drivers (just checked) 

Good cooling system, idle temp is 42c, at first I thought it was just cooling but even some games like Civ 5 which cause my gpu to run at 100% I can play for hours with no trouble, while an older and less graphically intensive game like darksiders does. Any ideas ? Best thing I can come up with is that some engines cause my gpu to overheat/crash. Any help welcome!
Thanks!

I wasn't really happy with my character names  but they will do. Of course any critique is welcome, whether it's on the story, the descriptive parts or just how I write.

The Cat.



They say behind every great man theres a greater woman. Sure.

Its remains sat still on the warm, sticky tarmac, the stench of lifelessness emanating like burnt toast from a morning fresh kitchen. So much emotion, all in a smell.
 	
 	
They chose the poor thing for one reason  selfishness. Their desire for an emotional attachment to a soul that wouldnt judge them, that wouldnt give up if they forgot to do the washing up, or left the oven on. That is what makes them despicable, fate didnt neglect its need for food or its predatory instincts, I didnt put in a cage like some bacteria under a microscope. No. They did. And that is what makes them the most despicable creatures I created.				
      
 Their journey starts at the pet shop. A family of three, leading the way is the father, Tom. Short, about five foot nine, slick short, curled back black hair and the swagger to match it. The epitome of my perfection. Retreating behind him is the mother, Mary-Anne. For the purpose of this story no description is nessacary. All you need to know is that she was a coward and by far the worst example of a human being I could possibly give, envy and loathing were second nature to her cruel mind. Last is the son of the family, George. He plays the largest role, the protagonist of our short story. 10 Years old, brown hair like his mother and blue eyes like his father.
 	
Their family was, at best, lower middle class. Tom worked for the Ontario police force           Chief Detective Tom Hilde Roberts. Mary-Anne stayed at home, looking after the dishes, the carpets and the child. The child, yes, George was George  he was the innocent in this.
 	
So, back to the pet shop. As they walked in the squeals of creatures echoed, from the squeaks of mice to the moans of cats and dogs, innocently being pawned off. Lucky for them (and us) they were not aware of this. The Roberts had gone out looking for a cat, Tom was the leader in this little endeavour, and where he went Mary-Anne followed.
 	
George, of course, being the child that he was, was ecstatic! A wonderful, fluffy, cute new friend to play with. The three of them walked up to the cats and before Tom could finish his word George leapt out from the cover of his father and said that one! They agreed on this, and soon enough took the cat home along with the full set of amenities. 
 	
This cat was black, from head to paw, eyes like deep black Obsidian gemstones, always heavy on the human heart, always joyful. Persuading humans was second nature to her.
 You havent seen a cuter animal than this.
 	
 She would look up at you, as if she was inquiring as to the nature of her existence  George would look back, with his curiosity peaking he was in a very similar situation, just on a different scale. They were perfect for each other, thats why they had to be split up; or at least thats what Mary-Anne thought.
 	
You cant just have that cat as a friend, I wont let you. Im your mother and I wont allow such an unhealthy relationship to continue she used to say. Weeks passed, Mary-Anne when she was at home would look back at the cat in a completely different way. Instead of looking at the cat like George, filled with curiosity, she despised the thing. Mary-Anne saw the cat as something that was dismantling their precious family. Of course this family didnt exist. A simple creation of Mary-Annes imagination, of course she believed this, and thats all that mattered.
 	
The calendar read June 7th, everybody and everything was relatively normal for a Saturday, half the time Tom would have to spend his Saturday at the office, this was one of those days. George ,Mary Anne and the Cat where home. George was playing very innocently with the Cat, with a smile on his face and laughter coming from his room. His mother called him down to do his chores, first up was taking out a relatively small rubbish bin. George passed through the kitchen and his mother, who was at the time drying off the dishes, saw his smile. She turned her head in anguish and gave out a negative hmph,  turning her head back to the attention of the sink.
 	
George returned from the garden, twilight was beginning to set over the suburban city blocks, giving any sounds or locomotion a dim calm. This was about to be shattered. George returned into the kitchen. Mary-Anne watched him come in from the cold. She tried to make herself believe she cared for him. She didnt. Mary-Anne saw his neutral-ness turn into a smile. She turned her head to see George and Cat connecting in the happiness that they had. She shouted. Bellowed from the top of her lungs. Anger in its purest form was let out. GET OUT ! GET OUT OF MY SIGHT ! She pointed to the door as Georges smile turned into a frown.
	
George ran outside in the simple sadness that a child could have. He ran to the front door ,eyes filled with tears. The portal opened, he ran.. Heart beating like never before. George covered his eyes to wipe the tears off, to clear his vision. Too late.
 	
Its remains sat still on the warm, sticky tarmac, the stench of lifelessness emanating like burnt toast from a morning fresh kitchen. So much emotion in a smell.
	
So Tom sat, holding George on the  road of his sons final resting place. A heartbroken expression was conveyed to Mary-Anne, eyes and mouth big. She stood in the doorway,  washing up gloves and all. Minutes passed as Tom simply starred at her, as if to say you. As if to act surprised. 

Sure.

 For a lack of a better sub-reddit (to my knowledge, i'm sure there is one out there) i'm posting this here - my thoughts are something like this : If the majority of people that get offended by racial slurs ( Chinese, African Americans etc.) agreed to banish the official meaning, literally to ignore that it ever had any meaning then anybody that tried to use racial slurs in an offensive manner would be as useful as calling someone a table.

I've never actually had any formal philosophy education so my thoughts are sort of everywhere (and iv'e read on this sub-reddit that philosophy helps you to organize thoughts and concepts) so if anybody could help me out just to develop this, or drive it into the ground if it's flawed (tbh there's probably a good chance it is) please feel free to. 
Thanks.

 Yep, I don't mind it being said in non serious matches of course. 




 Heard this said on an official stream, what does this word even mean at that level of play? You're not going to see some of these professional players not actually trying to play, or just taking the games as if they were playing normal solo q, playing with their eyes half closed not giving a shit.

Not only that but it's insulting to the player to say that just because someone under performed it means they weren't trying hard enough.

Sorry if this is a bit harsh, but that word is mostly used by people who call people better than them tryhards and people worse than them noobs. It's a really stupid word, and has no place at that level of play.

Thoughts?

 It seems a bit of a low blow just to try and discredit him over things he did then; and it really shouldn't have any impact on how you view his purely informative guides, it's not like he's trying to put across that he's the most perfect player and person in the universe. We've all made mistakes, as i'm sure you have. We try to learn from them and move on. How would you like it if in every post you made on reddit some guy was bringing up your past begrudgingly?

 You say that, but the multiplayer in Blacklist is honestly it's best feature, an well worth going through uplay. 




 That's probably because it's a lot easier to disagree with an idea than to hand over your cash. Also the experiment probably would have been better if they put up a sign "DONT HELP THE POOR" instead, rather than just trying to piss people off with inflammatory comments.

 That SSID/MAC idea is genius, too bad there isn't WiFi in all stations. Although what you could do is set it up so the users taps when he's at one of his stops, the app scans for nearby networks and works of those instead. Not sure if you'd be able to find any in some of the deeper underground stations, however. Maybe you could record the time between each stops after the first time setup, then if no SSID's are available, give or take 5 seconds of when they should be it wakes you up, sort of as a backup for a dodgy phone or network. 




 You're absolutely right. Who does UKIP think it is, making fun of WW2 like that? Bloody bastards.

 You don't go to a comedy show, hear a story about a restaurant then decide on that story if you think it's worth going to that restaurant, do you? Of course not. The comedian is there to make you laugh, and that often entails misrepresenting whatever he's talking about in one way or another. People that don't see that, then complain about how he's misrepresenting whatever game just aren't looking at it right. 




 You're right, it's shit if you look at it like a review. Too bad his videos aren't meant to be reviews.

 Hey,

I asked a few hours ago about how I would go about modding one of my Eclipse Phase campaigns. I got a ton of really awesome answers. 

I made these wallpapers primarily for me and the people I play, but since you guys are really cool I thought it only fair to share them here.

Please feel more than free to use/share them :

 Hey,

I'm looking to run an Eclipse Phase scenario with some of my mates (two) and the only problem is the majority of the scenarios come with a 'required' amount of four players. I however see people/books saying that it is possible to run a scenario with less players, but no where have I read how I would alter the scenario for less players.

Let's say there's four enemys they have to face, do I just halve that down to two enemys? Or would I halve some of their stats instead?  Of course it isn't always as simple as this, so i'd be interested and appreciate any help people could give.

The scenario i'm interested in is Glory, if that helps.

Cheers. 



















 I've heard people use subcap, cap, supercap, carrier, dreadnaught and titan. I'm just really confused as to what the usage of the 'cap' ones are. Afaik the 'cap' ones are used independent of of the other ones? What ships do they apply to?  Cheers

Edit: thanks to everybody that helped, upvotes to all! 




 Hi,
Does anyone have a link to a list of support skills that you should prioritize on making a new character? I've seen plenty of lists but they usually just list all of them instead of which are most important. 

Also if anyone knows what support skills are good to train if you don't know what EWAR race you'll be flying but want to generally go ewar? 

Cheers for any help. 














 The goal of zen is to trick the ego, i.e. to trick it into making the illusion go deeper and deeper, until eventually you are able to look back at the game you've played and realise the futility. Only then you can live half as the ego, and half as the God head, as a true genuine fake. Playing the game of life, just as you always did, in the same way as you always will.

Maybe Enso represent the full circle that the ego takes on its journey to be extinguished ?

I think people take the rituals too seriously, but maybe that's the point.

Just some thoughts, take them as you will.

There all fairly simply in terms of actual design so i'd prefer it if you just gave me a quote and an image for me to superimpose them, or just something to do with text.

If I do end up making something for you I don't really mind how much doge you give me, just not a stupid amount.

Will check back later on today and get on any requests!
 



















 Hi all, here's my character sheet : http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/character/twilights-hammer/Enigmi/advanced and i'm looking for some help on where to go next. I'd like to continue tanking, so can I do heroics now or do I have to get better gear before I start them? Where would I get this gear ? Also, I have about 314 Ghost Iron Ore and I was wondering If i should keep them and prospect them when my jewelcrafting gets high enough or turn them into bars and AH them or get a blacksmith to make me gear with then? Any ideas? Thank you for any help!.

 I'm genuinely curious, it would be my #2 or 3. It certainly has it's moments, and Picard is played almost to perfection, but dosen't it seem a bit dull compared to something like DS9 or ENT S4 ? It seems to have all the good elements of what a Star Trek series should be, but the only element that stands out to me as being the hallmark of TNG is it's affinity for a philosophical undertone, which all of the Star Trek series have. Could it be that's the one that most people on the internet grew up with ? Thoughts ? 









 Heya, iv'e been playing for two days now and iv'e been trying to get into the mage control class. Now I always try and wait for the opponent to make their move, so that I can get the card advantage and what not; but most of the time they also wait for my move and so it becomes almost a stale mate. This stays until I play a card and they end up assassinating it or whatever, and they always end up getting more cards on the board. Anyone have any tips that would help someone like me ? Just basic stuff; iv'e watched kripp/ls's videos so far.

Also, can anyone lead me to any resources for building a strong mage control deck ? I don't have any Legendaries yet but iv'e unlocked all the mage basic cards.

You could add a list of bullet points, then click on one of the bullets and it would take you to almost another folder, where you can put more bullet points.

Any ideas?

 Someone's a bit defensive. I don't think the person you replied too was being too serious mate... 




 It's amazing how relatable this is. If you've ever made something, you'll see someone say it's shit, but know that you've just done something wrong, and that the concept is still strong. You'll know that next time you can do it again, but better. 




 Considering a modder came out with those files not even one month later, I doubt it. They didn't trust us enough to make the decision for ourselves, now we have to not trust them anymore. 




 They just didn't trust us. Now instead of us *possibly* being mad over them not finishing it, we have no choice but not to trust them anymore. It's a much higher price IMO. 




 Not only this, but ubisoft didn't trust us to make the decision for ourselves. Okay, so the new graphics are a tad glitchy. Why not include them anyway and let people turn them on/off if they wanted to? I doubt the community would have reacted as badly to them saying 'were not finished but we're still giving you the option' as they are to them just straight up lying to us.

 Yeah I noticed that too after posting it here. It dosen't seem like theres many up to date free recourses like this one. If anything the theory probably still holds, but the practical side of things probably dosen't (99% of the links are broken, but the software is still out there). 









 Travel here for the city, not for the convention. 




 Really? If you use something like Airbnb you can get some pretty good accommodation for 45~ pounds a night, and if you pick the right place, a good host who is kind, and will answer any questions. 

If you eat out every day then, yes, like any other country it will be expensive, although granted it's still not 'cheap' if your making your own meals.

Not sure what you mean by a nightmare traffic system? If you mean in terms of road congestion then you're going to find that in any large city you go to, not just London.

With the mass transit you just need to use the replacement bus' services on weekends, otherwise AFAIK they're usually pretty good about keeping everything open in the week days. It's not like you won't be able to get somewhere just because they've blocked off a few tube stations.

The people are welcoming when you get to know them. The stranger culture, on the other hand, is different than most American states, you won't find strangers being quite as cuddly towards each other. For the most part however, 99% of strangers i've encountered are kind and helpful. Just like any other large city.

In terms of things 'to do', as well, there's pretty much an endless list of museums, places to visit, clubs to go to, beautiful architecture, etc etc etc.

 Trust me when I say this, 90% of things said on this and the eve forums is speculation. Someone told someone something that CCP actually ghost patched two patches ago, and they still think is the truth. You're better off testing most things rather than asking them on these forums.

 Just wanted to point out your description of airstone, made me laugh because it reads like one of those infomercials (/r/hailcorporate?).

We used airstone for the patio.  It's great because it is 75% less weight than real stone, so you don't need to build any footers, yet it still looks and feels like real stone.  It's cheaper than real stone, you can only get it at Lowe's.  It's best to cut it with a hack saw, but you could also use a band saw if needed.  No need for any mortar or mess, you simply apply it with any outdoor construction adhesive (we used locktite) and you're good to go!

 Good thing we didn't ask for your opinion. 




 Three points:

1.This post reeks of insecurity. No one that's remotely successful in real life feels the need to defend themselves in a 1500 word essay to a bunch of internet strangers, unless of course they're, in some way, invested in that community. Why take the time?

I really have no interest in this game or community anymore

Seriously? See my above point.


 2.You still haven't apologized for when you did flame him. No 'sorry', no 'I guess I did something bad'. In fact, you completely avoid the matter of reconciliation and just say that the fact that you've stopped is enough. Seriously, WTF? Anyone with basic reasoning skills can see the absurdity of this.

3.The fact that you just deleted the comment you got called out on (http://i.imgur.com/rnYE344.png) means we can't trust your comment history, or your claims of not flaming him in 6 months.You even reply to that comment not with a humble or an apologetic tone, but with the words "Haha I forgot about that". Seriously? Is this how a person who works "full time in a STEM field" acts? Although TBH doing tech support is working in a STEM field too, I guess. 




 awesome, thank you for all your input. 




 Thanks for the detailed answer, it's interesting hearing your perspective on it. On the thing about C/C++ i've made some pretty long programs in Java, will that come in useful? I assume people have made malware embedded in java programs before? Also, should I just randomly choose whether to go with C or C++ or perhaps go for C++ because thats closest to what I know? 

Another question, what do you mean by 'learn the PE'? Do you mean just getting an overview of it through somewhere like this website: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc301805.aspx or is there a book that you could recommend? Cheers again. 




 So I should learn Assembly - Python - C - C++? Cheers for the info about the calling codes, will read up on that. 




 Cheers for the detailed reply. I'll definately look into that python book. What's your take on C/C++ in terms of priority to learn for analysis? I've heard that Java and C++ are quite similar so the leap wouldn't be that hard for me. 




 I already know a bit of java, from what i've heard it's useful to know C/C++ (both?), Assembly, and Python(?), which one should I learn first? 

For books, i've read on this subreddit that Malware Analyst's Cookbook and Practical Malware Analysis are the best? Any other books you'd recommend? I have a basic background in CS, nothing graduate level however. 

Would you recommend I read up on other, broader, fields before Malware Analysis, perhaps something like forensic analysis for windows?

Cheers.

 they were just ratting? im pretty new to this game so i wouldnt know that just by the kb, i was just genuinely interested in what the term carebear was used for 




 uwotm8? my question was about the term carebear because i thought that was just for highsec gankers. ive seen plenty of other people too ask simply questions and get negative scores for some odd reason. 




 lol. love how this subreddit downvotes legitimate questions, its pretty mindboggling

 This should be possible, but only with every titan in EvE doing it within a 10 minute window. 




 I'm re watching the second half of ENT (can't stop loving that xindi story arc) and i've noticed that when one of the crew wakes up from being unconscious, they'll often say something like "It feels like a shuttlecraft just hit my head" or "it feels like I just ran into a brick wall". Anyone else notice this or am I just crazy? 




 Before you go around calling someone shit at something you better be less shit than they are.

 That's a very beautiful picture. 




 so basically like every other eve corp but just with fun coms? 




 are you tishu? plz no slave set pullerino. 




 Kinky. 




 Especially if you can coordinate your EWAR with your DPS alpha, it can be amazing. 




 To get all the EWAR frigates to III and their EWAR skill counterparts to III required takes about 15 days. To IV takes about 42 days. This is not including required support skills like CPU Manag. IV.  This is also assuming you get base EWAR skills like Target Painting and Sensor Linking to IV to train Signal Suppression and Signature Focusing to III. Not exactly a few hours. 




 Hate to break it to you but what the other people in this thread said was true. Apart from there being discreet similarities the games are really nothing alike. I guess if you ran a guild the managment skills would be comparable but even then it's pushing it.

If you're completely new to the game: do the tutorials, do the sisters of eve quest line. Look at this website: http://swiftandbitter.com/eve/wtd/ and find out what you want to do. Join a corp for it. Get better at it, and above all have fun. 




 You won't find any other syndicate corp of that size accepting people one month old, that's for sure. 




 wait, accurate? as in god actually does this shit? what an asshole. 




 I usually get my cables within one week. Usually about 4 days later.

 There's a biiig difference between trying to be a good troll and trying to get negative karma. One requires subtlety, and the people you're talking to not really sure if they're being trolled.

 Was it 11 minutes long? Was it aimed to shock the viewer, possibly lowering the viewers enjoyment of the website because of it? Since you didn't counter with that i'll assume not. 




 Dosen't matter how true you think it is. It just has no place being that long or being placed on a website completely unrelated to the subject content, or being 11 minutes long, or having a shock advertisement when people just want to relax and watch video games.

Please don't try and hijack the thread to talk about your personal opinions on education. This isn't /r/education or /r/vegan. 




 Pretty much, that was nothing but a legitimate question and yet you get downvoted for it. What a bad way to represent a community. 




 Lol at the people downvoting you. I was actually wondering the same thing as your question, people are really salty and take this game way too seriously in this subreddit. You only downvote someone if they don't add anything to the conversation, not if you think they're a filthy casual.

 I'm not asking people to bring out the pitchforks, and people shouldn't, unfortunately that's sort of how reddit does things. I tried in my OP to be as objective as possible,hopefully I succeeded in that. 




 TotalBiscuit explains (possibly) why here: http://www.twitlonger.com/show/ngk4v1 

Tl;dr; looks murky because they only gave out pre-release codes to people they sponsored, but the DMCA claim makes it look like WB Games registered the cutscenes with Content ID, and they're being taken down autotmatically.

Although this is still only speculation as to why the videos were taken down, I don't think we can know exactly if they were DMCA'd manually, or be Content ID. 




 Good quote, awesome movie. 









 Is this some sort of exercise routine? 




 As long as they stick to the 9:1 ratio they should be ok. 




 Thank's for the heads up, I unsubscribed. 




 Nope, donkey, three strikes and you're account gets shutdown. He probably has one or two judging from the content on his channel. You seem to be a fan so I can understand why you're upset, but please at least try to understand it from the point of view of me and all the other people he's potentially stolen from. Thank you! 




 At the end of the day I dont care that he stole it, more so that he didn't bother to contact me. However, I know someone who will be really butthurt when they recieve a copyright strike and their video taken down. (   ) (*tips fedora*) 




 Video was 30 seconds m8, worked real hard. Thanks for your understaning 3 




 From what i've read that dosen't matter because the essence or the "heart" of my video was contained in that 7 seconds. 

http://youtube.com/yt/copyright/fair-use.html#yt-copyright-four-factors

http://publishing.wsu.edu/copyright/fair_use/ (See Amount of the Material Copied.)

The precendant for that 1% was set by  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_v._Warner_Books , but that was in conjunction with the fact that it was an educational piece. 

I'd appriciate if you could come up with a source.

Edit: Not only that, but 1% of 174 seconds (the length of his video) is 1.74. seconds. My clip was 7 seconds long.

 Sorry mate, but even if he is protected by fair use (and I checked US fair use laws a few times before posting this) the least he can do is send me a message telling me he put it in. Thank you for providing an opposing view though, it's always good to get both sides of an argument.

The only thing's I care about is this:

He made no attempt to contact me. He had to have downloaded and reuploaded the video, hence the shitty quality. I could have even provieded him with a clean copy through something like dropbox, but he's too big to care I guess.

He's monetising my content, making a shit ton of money through my video, with zero credit. 




 I submitted a copyright claim, hopefully the video will be taken down and people will follow suit if they see their video being reuploaded like this.

1. He made no attempt to contact me. He had to have downloaded and reuploaded the video, hence the shitty quality. I could have even provieded him with a clean copy through something like dropbox, but he's too big to care I guess.

2. He's monetising my content, making a shit ton of money through my video, with zero credit. 




 So hilarious he took a part of my video without even asking me. I would have said yes, even. It's sad to hear about poeple complaining about youtubers recieving erroneous copyright strikes when huge ones like dunkey do it so blatently. 









 Black ops jump bridge, was thinking of the redeemer. 




 They're alright at best. For example mastery level 3 on the curse dosen't even allow for T2 neuts - on a neuting recon ship. And for the redeemer at level 5 it makes absolutely no mention of JFC or Jump Portal Generation. 




 Mastery 3's are alright, at best. The Curse at mastery level 3 want's capacitor emmision level 3 - which dosent even allow for t2 neuts, on a primarly neuting ship. 




 This is not becoming of a *junior fc.* 




 He's just a really bad troll. Can't believe people can't see that. 




 Next time instead of making an back handed butthurt comment try to understand why they think it's shit. An example reply would be "What aspects of the comic do you think are shit?". Don't post your work on a public forum if you're going to get offended when someone insults it.

Edit: After reading your comments its obvious you resorted to trolling because you can't seem to process that someone might not like you're amazingly hilarious comic. 




 Don't why you're getting downvoted. Launcher wasn't working for me and I use the exefile to get back in instead.

 He said it wasn't about the money. He's been a mobile app/game develper for the last 10 years, and he only went part time for the past year~. He said it was more about time he can give to his family and so that he can be more devoted to his work because that's his passion too. I'd wait for the youtube video tbh.

 I just read the devlog and Garry stated how he liked creating the tool for the clothes previewing and disliked not many people using it. This lead me to thinking about something lke what Valve has to implement player made gun/clothing models. 

Possibly we could have something like that, something that goes through a strenuous review process then gets added to the game. Alternatively something that just allows for a server to install a limited ammount of extra textures, a la modding. 

At least then the tool's he creates for the devs will reach more people (don't get me wrong though, the usage of the tools is an extension of the whole modding/community created content, not the other way round).

This is still a really open ended idea, and i'd love to hear peoples thoughts on it. 




 already happened, rip me, and lol at you editing out the ship names. glad to know i'm not the only one who thinks they're shit. 




 your ship names gave me cancer 




 Talking of points, seeing that pod get away made me sad inside.

 I think my skill queue must have been doing it automatically, because I haven't been hitting apply for the past four months that i've been playing. Either that or i'm hitting it sub conciously. Any idea where to turn on that notification? I don't remember editing any options like that. 




 Is this meant to cut down on supercap scamming? 




 I haven't been clicking on apply at all! Thanks all for the info. 




 It's happened about 4 or 5 times so far, i'll have finished a train, put new skills in the queue, log out and then when I log back in it will be like I never put any skills in the queue. I must have wasted a few days at least from this. Am I doing something wrong or is it just a bug? Cheers 




 Can you even give a rough detail? Like, for example, 5 figures? 6 figures? could you buy a private jet? a bently? an island? I appriciate of course if you want to say nothing just to be safe. 




 What bullshit. The one thing i've learned from 'growing up' is that the whole clique shit and the gossiping never stops, no matter how old you are or how  well respected a company you work for. 




 What lingo they use, how they use it, etc. I've read storys about how they could impersonate someone in their company, but where do you do the research required to sound like you are? 




 Not sure why people are saying this is impossible. A possible vector of attack includes, for example, impersonating someone that got something wrong. "I sent you x, but really meant to send you y. My boss has been on my ass all day, would you mind changing it really quickly for me?". 

Most techniques like this require inside information into how they run things. What lingo do they use? How do they use it? Possibly you're an intern who dosen't know what they're doing.

 The bottom line is, impersonate someone in their chain of command, then use empathy or fear to get them to do shit for you. If you're looking for straight up SE discussion you might be better off in /r/realsocialengineering , generally people care less about morals or why you're doing something over there. 




 In my opinion, having a mind that is not riddled with prejudices and pre concieved notions, one that can take any idea by itself. Think of how a child dosen't care about if people watch when he dances because he has no concept of embarresment.  




 Would also be nice if they had a chance to jam/not work unless maintained perfectly, or something along those lines that made them just no where near as good as end game guns right now.  




 I can answer your last question, mobile internet. Don't know if OP is that smart though.

 Don't forget GEEMU... they're relevant.. right? 




 This is cringeworthy.

 I agree. I really should have said 'Akin to this quote is...'. 




 And to go with that, "You wouldn't want to be the first one to deviate". 




 Cheers for the info 




 "You'll make an exception." Of course you will, because if you didn't people would stop using your subreddit because the mods remove perfectly legitimate content just because it's about themselves. Rofl.

 Here's the kicker, you need to 'abstain' for three days every time before donating. That means no wanking or sex until after the six months. 




 I think by spam he means more so 'an influx of posts with very similar characteristics'. He's not saying they're worthless. He's not saying he doesn't enjoy them. And I would hardly call this censorship, more so organization. At the end of the day he's taking the time out of his today to help this community, if you think you can do it better perhaps you should start your own subreddit. 




 If I had to guess the MPAA got bored with their lawyers and just decided to pay the mods off. Seems like it would be the most effective way to get rid of a sub. 
























 Shameless plug for /r/mashups. Come join the party! 




 Guns are probably called either Light Electron Blaster I (up close and personal) or 75mm Gatling Rail I (further away). The repair module is probably the Small Armor Repairer I. 




 What was the name of your ship? 




 Nope. You can make a ton of difference in fleet fight with minimal skills.  




 Assuming new character, it takes way more than 2 months (66 days) for something simple like this: https://zkillboard.com/kill/42580382/ . That's not including required fitting skills like PWG/Cap managment (or jury rigging skills), and all level 4 on everything related excluding weapon upgrades. 




 Not me, if you look close enough you can see I said 'near' perfect skills. At least in solo pvp if you want to even try to win the majority of fights, you should have at least all level 4 on the related skills. Of course you can still be really annoying with EWAR at a low skill level, but something like DPS you need good skills or you'll feel useless. 




 Stay classy boys. *tip*. 




 I completely agree, but you have to understand too that even getting near perfect frigate + small weapon skills takes what, a couple of months? Which is nothing to us but huge to people that have played completely different MMO's like WoW. 




 Not very feasable. There are ways to do it, but its quickly going to turn into a job, and is probably an easy way to get burnt out. Sharing money from invites is probably referring to the 21 day trial invite. The inviter gets a PLEX which is worth approximately 930mill isk, as long as you actually upgrade your trial into a full account. If you do this with someone you trust they can split the $$$ with you. 




 http://store.markeedragon.com/catalog/EVE_Online_30_Day_Free_Trial_Code.html You can get a 30 day trial if you don't wish to get the ISK. 




 Yeah, if you have the money buying a character is definately worth it. 




 I pay that because of how much entertainment I get out of it. Lots of fun, and a great community. 




 https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/2n18op/this_is_eve_uncensored_2014_new_trailer_uses/cm9iixv This dude explains it nicely. 




 When warping from system to system (BRAVE Corp.), they got caught in a warp disruption bubble that stops their warp and traps them inside the bubble, stopping them from warping off. As soon as this happened Rooks and Kings used the most expensive ship in the game (titan) to teleport themselves into that bubble. Rooks and Kings were in specially tanked, AOE damage dealing ships. So essentially it's like a group of people walking into an ambush and then throwing molotov cocktails on their faces. Really effective, hard to pull off.

Edit: I take too long to respond apparently! 




 Bought Far Cry 4 when the reviews came out, and now my game won't save. Can someone please test my save to see if it works on your machine (make sure you make a backup of your own save first)? Please only test it on a retail copy.

 Another stupid question, can't some copyright troll just signup for a private tracker and then get the IP's of the peers? I guess that's where using a VPN comes into play?

 I mean publicity = money in this case. He's stated in the past that he lives off ad revenue from Youtube, and you can't deny that this would bring him a lot of it. 




 I caught the video pretty early, and there were not many comments. I saw someone posted a VOD, refreshed a minute later and the comments were gone. 




 I think that's just what Athene heard, it's very possible this dude just abused the exploit in the Jade Forest. 




 Yeah. This is a troll, but he usually dosen't disable comments when someone points this out. 




 Yeah it was meant as a joke, but good advice none the less. 




 Lucky as fuck! I envy you! .__. 




 I guess if you don't care about potentially getting a cease and desist letter it's also okay (https://www.reddit.com/r/trackers/comments/2lptdi/anyone_got_a_cease_and_desist_letter_from_using_a/clxe4w8). 




 He meant public trackers, versus private trackers (ones that require invites). 




 The large majority of people will never have a problem with public trackers. There have been and will be incidents, however, of people recieving cease and desist letters from their ISP, or even being sued because they downloaded something.  




 He's talking about public trackers vs private trackers. 




 Might want to look at this before deciding on IPT: https://www.reddit.com/r/trackers/comments/2m3yri/longtime_ipt_usernever_looked_into_anything/ 




 I know there are VPN's you can get with BTC/throwaway credit card that don't log info like that. I imagine there must be a seedbox with similar policys (given what they're generally used for...). 




 Apparently IPT is one of the few private trackers that people have recieved C D letters from (see https://www.reddit.com/r/trackers/comments/2lptdi/anyone_got_a_cease_and_desist_letter_from_using_a/ ) Also might want to stay away from IPT in general because of this: https://www.reddit.com/r/trackers/comments/2m3yri/longtime_ipt_usernever_looked_into_anything/ .

Unrelated but i've heard from a few places that IPT is actually pretty easy to get into. Can't say though because i've never actually tried... 




 Yeah I agree, would suck if they just took that, but I feel like Valves enough of a good guy greg that they wouldn't, especially in the internet age.

 I completely agree. OP could have used reworking the title, and maybe saying upfront that it was a competition between friends. 




 Huh, I wonder what happened in that thread then? Or maybe you'd call that something other than elitism? 




 Thank you for being calm and level headed... it's much needed in this thread. 




 Sure, and I wonder if it's possible to have a friendly discussion as opossed to the rampant elitism and vitriolic comments like in that thread. It's really quite saddening. I personally love chilli, and I think i'll have to make my way down to texas some day because over the pond we don't have nearly as much a following for it! 




 Unfortunately i'd be suprised if this dosen't discourage people quite a lot. I'm curious if this is a common problem in this sub? 




 On top of that, there's the people who upvote them, bringing their virulent comments to the top.  




 Hey,

My apologies in advance if this is in bad etiquette, i'm not sure what the rule is regarding meta/self posts on this sub. 

I don't really frequent this sub, but after looking through the comments of http://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/2k30b0/i_cant_stop_winning_chili_cookoffs/ this post I can't really say that I will now, or understand why anyone else does.

I understand people are passionate about what they love, whether that be chilli or food in general, but there's really no need for the amount of pure vitriol and hatred in that thread. The OP came here to share their love for food, and it's really disgusting that people feel the need to post/upvote (gross 46 upvotes) shit like this: 

Jesus fucking christ. This is almost as bad as that retard last week who posted cheetos and beef jerky as snacks to go with wine. Sonnn.
Recipe for award winning chili: grab a can of everything from the Hispanic shelf at Walmart. Dump in crockpot. Eat with fritos.

and this (gross 15 upvotes)

That looks fucking disgusting. Also, it's not chili, it's "Kentucky Bean and Corn Surprise."

These are only two examples of the purely malicious comments that were posted in that thread. How can you expect people to share in your passion if you try to bully them into accepting your opinion?

If this gets removed because meta/self posts aren't allowed then my only hope is for the mods to take this into consideration.

If it dosen't, then please, think before you type. There's people behind the computer screens, and damn good  way to share your passion for something, and maybe change their opinion, is to be friendly about it, and to teach them like their your friend, not the enemy.

Cheers. 




 Assuming that's the case I don't disagree. And I can completely understand how they might have intended that post to classify this as an exploit, but taking that rule with no context (which shouldn't have to be provided, it should speak for itself), it's ambiguous. I don't think arguing this is going to change anything, however. I understand your point, and if you're right CCP will reimburse the person and maybe banhammer the offenders. Good talk. 




 before it was declared an exploit.

If you're referring to the CCP post, it heavily implies that it's talking about lighting a cyno while the forcefield is already online. I agree it's an exploit (at **best** a clever use of game mechanics) but i'm just not so sure it's *official*. 




 This brings back strange memories of the Camel ATXI raffle... Although I guess if EN24 scammed people then that would mean people wouldn't trust their stories?  




 If I understand your post correctly people knew about lighting a cyno then putting up the forcefield 6 years ago and took that post as saying that was an exploit? Or did people know that they could light one inside an already lit forcefield, as the post implies? Apologies for my ignorance, but I wasn't around for this exploit.

Still, your below post right, it's stupid to even walk on the thin line, whatever CCP's stance. Hopefully this will provoke a statement from them. 




 That post heavily implies you shouldn't be able to light a cyno inside an *already up* field (as opposed to lighting a cyno, then putting up the field), although it does not explicitly state that. Seems to me CCP need's to put out another, clearer, statement on whether this is allowed. After all this is 6 years later too. 




 Pretty simple cause and effect. Life lesson: Stay away from social media when you're mad. He deserved this, I only feel some remorse for him because now his whole career is down the drain because of a moment of rage and stupidity.

 Wat. The eve community is pretty shit, at least the reddit one. I've seen more than a few legitimate questions get downvoted for absolutely no reason.

 Very true. Cheers for all your answers. 




 Hey,

Apologies for sortof posting this again, but the last post about this was made when 5e was still being playtested. Is 5e the easiest to get intto DM'ing or should I still look to 4e? 

Cheers

 The expansions are free, what you're probably paying for is some useless ship skins and a few really cheap frigates. These links pretty good: https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/1c211z/the_have_a_tip_leave_a_tip_eve_thread_round_v_the/ 




 Personally i'd go 3 torps and a scram. Not sure if that's the correct decision, however. 




 Really? Can people still do this even though CCP owns the rights to the game? 




 Damping is basically the more reliable version of ECM. Personally I prefer ECM to dampening, purely because it's more rage inducing. You're right, things like the scorpion do tend to get primaried. I'd suggest going into the tech 2 frigates for small gang (Keres and Hyena are the most favoured) and the Recon for fleet/black ops fights (although even those tend to die fast, as they're not very tanky at all). Something to note too, techinically the Armageddon (Amarr battleship) is an EWAR ship as it gets very good bonus' to neuts. I even think BRAVE might have it as its doctrine.  




 I think it's just 4chan trolls trying to make reddit look bad. What they don't realise is that reddit probably shares a large ammount of its userbase with 4chan. 




 Use the extension hide fedora. 




 Yeah i'm more thinking of lowsec/nullsec. 




 Shit, should I have added a /sarcasm tag? I can't tell who's joking anymore, this is too meta for me. 




 You need someone to refer you. Sent you a pm with the link (posting it in comments is a big no-no.) 




 Awesome iniative. I might donate if it gets rolling. A sidenote, battleclinic has some *really* *really* bad fits sometimes. I find it useful to corroborate them with zkillboard losses, and always check the date on the fit, in case it was made a few years ago. 




 Lmao. Space drama best drama.

de*veldrin: you walk around like you're fucking high and mighty. my morning shit today had more value then you

Best line.

 




 Holy shit. If that isn't the most stunning thing i've seen all week I don't know what is. 




 Do ittt! I'll even double your isk if you come back now! :D 




 Yep. There is a warning before you accept the contract, however, saying that you might not be able to enter the station. You have to be pretty silly (or tired) to accept it. 




 Don't know *where* you wont be killed, but I know ships like the Skiff are a deterant to suicide gankers becuase they're so tanky and deal so much damage.

Also the lower the sec status (0.5 vs 1.0 for example) the longer it takes for the space police to respond and kill your attackers. Keep that in mind. 




 Imagine having a courier contract set to inside fort knox. Basically guy turns up in a fedex truck and gets told to fuck off. 1 day later courier contract fails and the scammer gets the collateral. 




 An apt description of the couirer contract scam (one of them, at least). 




 really cool video. Would probably be a lot better if voiced differently (something about the tone is off?). 




 Think I read (dont quote me on this) it was going to be around 1.1b, bit cheaper than a freighter. 




 You should watch some videos on how to fit a ship (looks like most of your ships are missing rigs, and modules) , then go on zkillboard and look for losses for some example fits.

Edit: if you'd like I can help you out with the whole fitting a ship thing, PM me. 




 How much did he get you for?

Edit: Nvm. 




 I would have given the money back. 




 Fught ev0ke a few months ago who were in HAM(?)gu's and basi's. Good number of them too. 




 I'm sorry, the anti-PL circlejerk is only okay in my eyes if it produces some quality OC. 




 Yeah I think they did. Maybe make them have 0m/s, need support machs to bump them! 




 He changed his flair, hes INK now! Magic! 




 I think if it was that easy CCP would have done it already (or they think it's just fine as it is). From my quite limited experience dealing with them, i'd say maybe you could make them go slower. Most of the problems i've had with them is actually catching the damn things. 




 Yeah, that Tech 2 sentry train is a bitch. I guess we'll only know when there's something better than them, not necessarily when they're balanced. 




 No idea, should ask someone that uses them! 




 Pretty lazerbeams. 




 Yeah i'm relatively new to the game, I don't think i'm in a position to suggest nerfs or buffs. If it was so easy that I could suggest something (or even you, having used them extensively) to 'fix' it then CCP would have done it already.

Granted too most of the bitching i've heard is either from reddit or corp mates, i've never actually flown one. I can see however why they're considered OP. 




 Not turning off formatting in pidgin 




 Good question, I don't really know the exact numbers or even the bonus', thats up to CCP to decide through tons and tons of playtesting. It's pretty well agreed, even by the people that use them, that ishtars need a proper nerf. They're the goto PvE and PvP ship right now, I know that much. 




 I'm fine with that as long as Ishtars are nerfed too. 




 https://zkillboard.com/kill/42928756/

What is this ship meant to do? 




 Good thing my railgu is almost finished. 




 It's basically real life spaceship simulator with no rules against scamming and infinite respawns. 




 A suprisingly apt description. 




 And nothing of value was lost. 




 In the end, there is only one survivor.... the one with the most ishtars. 




 CEO is also fond of SeBo'd fed navy commets... https://zkillboard.com/kill/42636105/ ... is this actually a thing? 




 Aw yeah, Widow represent. 




 I'm more interested in the people in the right corner. I wonder what their story is. 




 Then you think of some clever work around to get that function working. It's all downhill from there. 




 Someone with 10 accounts going around and downvoting everyone, rofl. 




 Well if you weren't banned before you're going to be banned now... Also is it possible you didn't warp because maybe you lagged? There's plenty of possible explanations as to why your Garmur died, and they're not all CCP's fault. It's certainly not worth getting your account(s) banned. 




 Was he in a paladin? That looks like a bastion or a siege module on the right? 




 Means he got shadowbanned. 




 I wonder if this would make people actually use them. 




 Yeah it looks fine on firefox, probably just my browser. 




 I mean you say that... but I still don't know how territory is counted. Maybe it's the app I play on that fucks it up but I doubt it. 




 Or cuts your hand off with a machete, either work. 




 Must have accidentally set a break point before the REM function. 




 Sounds like a dream vacation. 




 I'm on windows 7 64bit, I do get some other wierd text errors on some websites so it's probably on my end. Weird because it's showing up as Helvetica Neue light on my end (using whatfont). 




 Probably intentional, like the Phased Weapon Navigation Array Generation Extron, or PWNAGE. 




 http://puu.sh/dgwmq/8d1615979a.png

The text at the bottom and on the side looks really packed in, is that intentional? I'm on Chrome 40/W7 - no extensions. 




 Not just any nubbins, *hisec* nubbins. I can't tell if this is a troll post. Look at that rattle fit, then look back at the thread title. 




 Is... is he on a fucking tower? ANOTHER FUCKING TOWER? GOD DAMNIT UBISOFT WE DONT NEED TO CLIMB ANYMORE FUCKING TOWERS. 




 Here we see a perfect example of autism. 




 Recall program got cancelled. 




 Mostly used in industry, however the game interface is slightly reminding of spreadsheets, the dscan (http://evewormholecorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/scannnooor.png), overview (https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5ce9kSbuijY/TWO1_vdep4I/AAAAAAAABHQ/8lVO5nuiozI/s1600/bb_overview.png) and market (http://justinandrewjohnson.com/sites/default/files/styles/fullsize/public/imagepicker/1/market_veldspar.png) to name a few. Don't let this intimidate you however, it's pretty easy to pickup in the first hours of playing. 




 I'm curious your opinion of this:http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/sep/24/slavery-exhibition-black-actors-cages-shut-down ? 




 They'd have to pay *me* to get me in there. 




 rofl 




 riiiip, do ratting carriers usually have those highs? 




 Toppest of keks. 




 What would they do to fix this? 




 shieeet, thats one blingy caracal. 




 Too bad nothing expensive died! 




 It's not directly said but it could be inferred from "You are buying/selling the character ONLY and nothing else".  




 CHECK CHECK CHECK, i'm pretty sure that word looses all meaning when you say it every two minutes.

["They're not awoxers, they're waffles, theres actual waffles in the fleet."](https://i.imgur.com/wUmTrQQ.jpg)  Quote of the day.  




 Am I missing something or does that FAQ not state that all assets stay on the character once transferred? I appriciate that he probably could give it back out of good will, but I don't see it in the rules. 




 You should take out those pictures of the GM conversation, pretty sure that's against the rules. Not sure what that GM's on about either. At least from my interpretation Rule 7 just states that you can't *list* items for sale, not that you have to return them if the owner forgets them. The FAQ pretty clearly states you lose those items afterwards. I could be missing something, however, and this is just my uninformed opinion.

Edit: I see how you could interpret that rule to mean that you're not allowed to leave any assets in the character, this does however seem to contradict that FAQ. 




 Not sure about the hat on the medic but the soldier looks really cool. 




 Launchers useful if you're going to be switching characters on the same account a lot. Don't have to enter your username/password every time. 




 Are the fittings for the ships in the cargo fucked up? https://zkillboard.com/kill/42721905/ looks like the hyena is a tengu.... 




 You forgot: Kills a 4 year old CFC vets titan by accident   




 Its fine tho, didn't you hear? It's already replaced, didn't want it anyway. 




 CFC just awoxed a blue, 4 year old CFC vet titan, i'm pretty sure you're not allowed to shit talk for the next few days. 




 Sometimes a mans gotta do what a mans gotta do. Aint noone that can stop soemone determined enough from just breaking it into dance. 




  I'm 90% sure that's Niles Crane from Frasier, just by looking at his body movements and hair. 




 I am the Mittani. 




 Here's a list of the coalitions and the alliances in them (dont believe that dude underneath me): https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/2fdcpk/rough_coalition_headcount_thread/ 




 I have very limited knowledge on this, but I know there are some alliances that have people specifically to produce caps/super caps, so theres that. Even if you join a big alliance as an industrialist you'd probably be expected to be able to fly some of their doctrines, I imagine. 




 Have you considered seeing a counselor or therapist? Would most probably help. 




 I mean, you're not wrong. Part of the reason I love playing eve is because of the political drama, real or fake, and i'm sure thats the case for a lot of other eve players too. 




 Just turn yourself in and it will all go a lot easier. 




 Don't get me wrong, I love the circlejerk, but that's about 20% of my motivations, the rest is me wanting the CFC outed as the completely insane alliance they are. Again, you're right, if this dude is telling the truth (which he probably isn't) then he should just go to CCP/the police, my intentions are selfish (mostly). Also awesome username by the way! 




 You're right, he should, if he has concrete proof on that, which he probably dosen't. Getting someone to verify his identity is really a service to the community, more than anything, so that we know for 99% sure that          the titan kill was wrong, and that anyone trusted at alliance level in CFC is likely to be doxxed illegally. It would be a huge blow to the CFC. 




 Check out this, hah: https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/2nlncj/on_goons_and_doxxing/ 




 This means nothing unless you're willing to verify you're identity with a trusted third party, /u/ChribbaX, for example. Someone you can trust not to reveal your identity to CFC, but that we also trust not to lie to us. Otherwise, assuming you're not lying, good read and thank you for posting. 




 Cool model. 




 You're right, not like releasing evidence would stop CFC super pilots from looking over their back, wondering if they're going to get kicked for frequenting the wrong bar or misspeaking on teamspeak. 




 I don't even think they know tbh. 




 Why would you even say this if you're not willing to provide any evidence, and thus further the discussion in any meaningful way. From what I gathered at least Reddit was dropping the subject, as they do most drama within a few days. I also wonder what GSF would have had to say if they hadn't kicked him, i.e. if SMA would even be in CFC anymore. 




 Any chance of getting it without the vocals? 




 Do you think that's the majority of people? I'd imagine the majority of people on private trackers know what they're doing, maybe i'm too naive though. 




 Dude its super secret opsec that they can't reveal (even to renew the trust of CFC super pilots who can't talk perfectly 100% of the time). 




 Nah man, it would "compromise our IT services" 




 [Hmmmm......](http://replygif.net/i/1242.gif) 




 The place is actually pretty clean, nothing like that sticks out in my mind like that (oh wait, I just remembered I found a hair in my sauce once, but that dosen't really bother me). I've never gotten ill off the food (at least to my knowledge), and i've been eating it for years, which makes me wonder what the criteria are for these ratings. 




 Aaand my local chicken shop has a rating of 1. Well, it hasn't killed me yet. I'm also curious how stringent the criteria for these ratings are. 




 Ah I see, it makes sense now, cheers for the explanation.  




 Is this just a badly hidden advertisement for your characters? I don't get the joke, sorry. 




 Oh, yay, it looks less like a space turd! 




 Eve is real. 




 Look at the interviewers face too, he's shocked at how much of a fool he is. 




 Gallenite looks the best.
