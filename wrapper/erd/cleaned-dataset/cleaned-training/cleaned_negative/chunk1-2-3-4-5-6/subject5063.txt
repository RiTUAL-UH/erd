 I'm a contractor. I can lie about being sick anytime and not get paid for it.  




 And a butt!  




 Your mom doesn't call because she knows you touch yourself.  




 Excellent!  I have 37 new bond ideas the Austin taxpayer will happily pay for before they have any idea what it actually does.  




 It started with his love of bracelets.  Then he built a career around it.  




 I think you've had enough carbs for today. Don't you?  




 At Walgreens I found Phillips Colon Health with a 1.5 billion cell blend of L Gasseri KS-13, bifodobacterium bifidum G9-1 and bifodobacterium longum  MM-2. 

Does that sound sufficient?  




 Wow.  You'd better have a little talk with your manager and find out where all that electricity comes from that you plug your little computer into.  (Lots of it is coal.)  Also, that chair you're sitting in isn't manufactured by wind energy.  Those lights above you?  I have some bad news about the manufacturing process.

You want the technology but don't want to think about where all the energy required to produce it originates from.  But sometimes symbolism is WAY better than actual substance. 




 What dollar amount would that require of me for an upfront investment to become partially liberated from the grid? 




 Perhaps you have vested interests in the technology industry. 

Is that why they'd have to pay your trinkets made off the back of the planet from your cold dead hands?  




 Damn! That was awesome!

 If the kid is retarded enough not to actually spell out the entire name of the game, he deserved it. 




 Nope. Because I wouldn't be preaching that a byproduct is what makes an industry evil as you might say. Do you feel guilty for having a phone?  




 People used to make a great living and entertain themselves without any of the stuff you mentioned. Actually, some still do. You just choose to use modern technologies for your own comfort it sounds to me. You choose not to do without.


I'd be willing to bet that you're even involved in an industry that not only utilizes said carbon unfriendly ends but that perpetuates the usage of them. Basically, it seems you're willing to use up the earth's resources for your own devices but at a slightly slower rate.


So sad. So hypocritical. 




 Man.  People used to exist just fine without computers.  Apparently you crave modern convenience without all the consequences. 

Don't tell me you have a phone too...  




 Yeah, but do realize how much petroleum those individual commuter parts take to manufacture? I would just give up your computer.  




 Never has the thought, "Need help?  Find a mosque!" ever crossed my mind.  




 Ooooooh man, computer huh? 

http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2009/06/embodied-energy-of-digital-technology.html 




 Sure! As long as you don't actually make use of any of those terrible petroleum byproducts in your daily life.  




 I just assumed you walk everywhere. What's more important? Saving the Earth or saving yourself some struggle by using petroleum based transportation? 

That way you can still preach to those that do and be in the clear.  




 How do you get around?  




 Gosh! You're saying that not everyone has done that yet?  Evil evil.  




 Maybe that's because right now it doesn't pay for itself.  




 Yeah. Groups of people are just inherently evil because of their position on the planet!  




 I look forward to seeing your 20 new news channels dedicated to all of the world's iniquities.  




 /s

I was being facetious in my comment.  




 Well good. Hopefully you're not so hypocritical as to ride in or drive a car at any time or wear or use items made with petroleum byproducts.  




 Oh no. I do. I also don't admonish people for doing the same.  




 Which has had more world impact?   Prrrrrrrobably Syria.  By about a mile or so.  




 Solar powered jets!  




 Number 13 will make you shit your toilet / Jew hiding place.  




 Apparently not enough for capitalists to smell money in them yet and hence the non payoff.  




 Bigger ongoing stories. Pretty simple really.  




 I guess we should dedicate an entire channel to wronged people in third world shit holes. It would probably require 10 channels going  24 hours a day.  




 If you're not against being surveiled you're for it. I assume you are standing on a street corner with a protest sign every day.  




 Eh, it happens hundreds of times every single day in those countries.    The US would only be condemning acts if that were true.  




 "We" is right. I assume you support your local oil fracker or have come up with a sustainable alternative energy.

 At the beginning of this month I re-signed a new, 10-month lease with my apartment complex.  I had been having my lease paid with an auto-deduct from my bank account previously and had been out of town from 6/27-7/7 while another apt resident came by to walk and take care of my dog every day.  Today I was gone all day and left my door unlocked since I'd misplaced my key in my luggage.  When I got home the door was locked and I had to pay a locksmith $150.  There was a notice to vacate for non-payment of rent, utilities, etc. charging me with unpaid rent plus $160 in late fees.  I guess that by re-signing the auto-deduct was not in effect but I didn't know that.  The dog walker said there were no notices from the apt complex on the door while I was gone and I did not receive any phone calls from them about my missing rent.  I even went into the office to temporarily borrow a mail key and a guy working there said nothing to me about anything.  I have not discussed anything with the apt complex yet and have never been late on rent before.  The notice dated today 7/9 states that I have to be out on 7/12.  PLEASE HELP! 
































































































































































































































 Holy shit that's disturbing.

 Actually 13 grams of fiber plus 6 grams of Erythritol (what I assume is a sugar alcohol) So 25-19=6 grams of carbs per bar. 1 being sugar.

 So I interviewed for a sales job I really want and they wanted me to go meet with four of their sales people. I thought the interview went great. After meeting with them they all had high praise for the company making me want to work there all the more. The sales people I talked to said that I needed to keep following up and that the mgrs I interviewed with would assume that anyone that didn't follow up didn't really want the job. I mailed two hand-written thank you notes two days after the interview and sent email follow-ups after each two sales people I met with. The problem is that I have since left several voicemails with no return and when I did get ahold of one of them he said he was on his way to a meeting and would call me back. (He didn't).

 It appears to be two separate lies from Williams. 

"the NBC anchor was nowhere near that aircraft or two other Chinooks flying in the formation that took fire." The report cited interviews with "crew members on the 159th Aviation Regiment's Chinook that was hit by two rockets and small arms fire." It said "Williams arrived in the area about an hour later on another helicopter after the other three had made an emergency landing."

 You may wonder why he had to come out with a real statement sooo much later that the events happened. We saw how weak and fleeting his response was compared to other world leaders and had to demand that he finally come out with a strong statement of support. 

Too bad it took him until December to do so.  




 Uh, I hate to burst your Obama bubble but this statement was made December 28, 2009. 

The protests began on June 13, 2009.

Maybe you should learn what a Google is.  




 Ah, voicing support for people is interfering. OK. He came out with this statement WAY late after there was an uproar from the American people regarding his stone cold silence on the matter.  




 How? How did he support it in principle? I remember watching Iranians hold up signs pleading for American support only to be met with stone cold silence from the admin.

Obama sure piped up when Egypt fell into revolution though!  




 Remember when the Iranians rioted and marched against their govt after their fraudulent elections and didn't get any support from the Obama admin?  




 Why didn't they shine lasers down the side of that thing and make that fucker light up?

"One way or the other, we are determined to deny Iraq the capacity to develop weapons of mass destruction and the missiles to deliver them. That is our bottom line." 
    President Clinton, Feb. 4, 1998. 

"If Saddam rejects peace and we have to use force, our purpose is clear. We want to seriously diminish the threat posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program." 
    President Clinton, Feb. 17, 1998. 

"Iraq is a long way from [here], but what happens there matters a great deal here. For the risks that the leaders of a rogue state will use nuclear, chemical or biological weapons against us or our allies is the greatest security threat we face." 
    Madeline Albright, Feb 18, 1998. 

"He will use those weapons of mass destruction again, as he has ten times since 1983." 
    Sandy Berger, Clinton National Security Adviser, Feb, 18, 1998 

"[W]e urge you, after consulting with Congress, and consistent with the U.S. Constitution and laws, to take necessary actions (including, if appropriate, air and missile strikes on suspect Iraqi sites) to respond effectively to the threat posed by Iraq's refusal to end its weapons of mass destruction programs." 
    Letter to President Clinton, signed by Sens. Carl Levin, Tom Daschle, John Kerry, and others Oct. 9, 1998. 

"Saddam Hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process." 
    Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D, CA), Dec. 16, 1998. 

"Hussein has ... chosen to spend his money on building weapons of mass destruction and palaces for his cronies." 
    Madeline Albright, Clinton Secretary of State, Nov. 10, 1999. 

"There is no doubt that . Saddam Hussein has reinvigorated his weapons programs. Reports indicate that biological, chemical and nuclear programs continue apace and may be back to pre-Gulf War status. In addition, Saddam continues to redefine delivery systems and is doubtless using the cover of a licit missile program to develop longer-range missiles that will threaten the United States and our allies." 
    Letter to President Bush, Signed by Sen. Bob Graham (D, FL,) and others, Dec, 5, 2001. 

"We begin with the common belief that Saddam Hussein is a tyrant and a threat to the peace and stability of the region. He has ignored the mandate of the United Nations and is building weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering them." 
    Sen. Carl Levin (d, MI), Sept. 19, 2002. 

"We know that he has stored secret supplies of biological and chemical weapons throughout his country." 
    Al Gore, Sept. 23, 2002. 

"Iraq's search for weapons of mass destruction has proven impossible to deter and we should assume that it will continue for as long as Saddam is in power." 
    Al Gore, Sept. 23, 2002. 

"We have known for many years that Saddam Hussein is seing and developing weapons of mass destruction." 
    Sen. Ted Kennedy (D, MA), Sept. 27, 2002. 

"The last UN weapons inspectors left Iraq in October1998. We are confident that Saddam Hussein retains some stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons, and that he has since embarked on a crash course to build up his chemical and biological warfare capabilities. Intelligence reports indicate that he is seeking nuclear weapons..." 
    Sen. Robert Byrd (D, WV), Oct. 3, 2002. 

"I will be voting to give the President of the United States the authority to use force  if necessary  to disarm Saddam Hussein because I believe that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a real and grave threat to our security."
    Sen. John F. Kerry (D, MA), Oct. 9, 2002. 

"There is unmistakable evidence that Saddam Hussein is working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will likely have nuclear weapons within the next five years . We also should remember we have alway s underestimated the progress Saddam has made in development of weapons of mass destruction." 
    Sen. Jay Rockerfeller (D, WV), Oct 10, 2002, 

"He has systematically violated, over the course of the past 11 years, every significant UN resolution that has demanded that he disarm and destroy his chemical and biological weapons, and any nuclear capacity. This he has refused to do." 
    Rep. Henry Waxman (D, CA), Oct. 10, 2002. 

"In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including al Qaeda members. It is clear, however, that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare, and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons." 
    Sen. Hillary Clinton (D, NY), Oct 10, 2002 

"We are in possession of what I think to be compelling evidence that Saddam Hussein has, and has had for a number of years, a developing capacity for the production and storage of weapons of mass destruction. "[W]ithout question, we need to disarm Saddam Hussein. He is a brutal, murderous dictator, leading an oppressive regime ... He presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to miscalculation. And now he has continued deceit and his consistent grasp for weapons of mass destruction ... So the threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real ... 
    Sen. John F. Kerry (D, MA), Jan. 23. 2003.  




 Thank you Mr. Nimoy, for getting that stupid dress off the front page.  









 They shifted blame and tried to bury the fact that no help was sent to our embassy even though they were informed of the  8 hour long firefight.  




 A YouTube video that 20 people saw just happened to coincide with an impromptu 8-hour rocket launcher attack on a US embassy where our Ambassador was left to get repeatedly raped in the street and burned alive? 

Big deal. 

Unless, of course, Bush had been president at the time.  




 So we're still saying that a YouTube video that 20 people saw just happened to coincide with an impromptu 8-hour rocket launcher attack on a US embassy where our Ambassador was left to get repeatedly raped in the street and burned alive? 

OK.  









 I'll never stop staring. It's my right!  




 For now they just document it and file it away under "Maybe".  









 And false too. Just wait until the FCC starts doling out permits based on specific types of speech like they do TV networks.  Nearly impossible to start a new news network but you could've still done it on the Internet, until today.  




 Nigga, I ain't got time for all that!  




 Look at the bottom, it's black n blue. Start at the top, it's white n gold. Fucked me up until I did that.  




 Yeah, just a bunch of politically motivated govt bureaucrats in the FCC. The same ones that decide what can be on your radios and TV.  




 Right. You actually have to suck on the clit. It will vary from woman to woman.  




 Amen!  




 Jesus, I have to suffer because you couldn't wrap it up?  




 These militant beast-feeders are the fucking worst.  




 That doesn't seem like it's helping your metabolism.  




 Wouldn't it make you retain a ton of water and look puffy?  




 I'm sure no self-righteous bureaucrat would ever ban porn on a public utility. And do many other things that disagree with their particular inclination. 

So you've got that going for you!  




 They regulate heroin and child rape too! 

Why can't I fuck my wife in front of your playground? What kind of bullshit is that?  




 I'll tell my kid to bide his time for the perfect sucker punch and then stand by him no matter what.  




 Well, womens womens woobs aren't regulated by the govt. So feel free to murder as many fetuses as you feel is necessary!  




 You're going to have to help me out with woobs here.  




 Don't worry! Your govt only wants the best for you! Now, if they could just find and arrest that Snowden character who put those thoughts in your head...  




 Such as what?  




 This isn't going to speed your Internet up if anything your speed will get slowed to even out with everyone else's speed. Boom! Equality!  




 Don't worry!  The Patriot Act will never be used to target citizens!  




 Give me freedom or give me Netflix!  




 Admit it. You gave away a free Internet for fast Netflix.  




 Don't worry! We only want to use the Patriot Act to get them terrorists!  




 Netflix was using 33% of the bandwidth of the entire Internet. Of course they didn't want to have to pay for all that.  




 You don't actually think that handing control of the internet over to the people that monitor your every communication and impose their own morality upon citizens will make it better...  do you? 

You realize that it's not always going to be Obama at the reigns of the FCC but the GOP sometime in the future... right? 

And before you say it doesn't do that I remind you 1. Nobody's read the bill. 2. The FCC Chair refused to testify about the contents of the bill in front of Congress and 3. Once a govt starts regulating something it only adds more regulations as time goes by without ever reducing regulations.

You traded your free Internet for Netflix to not have to pay for the 33% of bandwidth they are using.

 Control. It's always control. Fortunately he has a ton of brain-dead followers who don't want their Netflix disturbed even though that's exactly what will happen.  





























 Right. Remember that when the lawsuits fly. Personally, I have no problem w gay marriage but it will be a one way street later.  




 I don't think the state should be involved in anyone's marriage. No special benefits should be doled out by the state.  




 I guarantee you people will begin suing churches for discrimination. Some whacky courts will uphold it.  




 Will you be as passionate in your defense of those churches that choose not to marry gay couples because they feel it impinges on their religious mandate? If so I think both sides win here. I don't see it happening that way personally.

 Maybe they should designate ALL of the Eastside as Section 8 housing. There are a ton of people living here that really can't afford the pricing.
