 if you are the police, would you come to the shit part of town at night when guns are firing everywhere?

 how is making 15 mil in the first weekend almost no money 




 they just release ballons that flop into NK, this is more of a publicity stunt for the camera

the movie surely have already enter the NK black market with USD stick and DVD smuggled from china.  




 it does have some good fight scene. it that is what you like.  




 for Pompeii they did get their money worth in the special effect, it looks quite good, if only it have a better script. 




 his version of Hercules is a financial success, he did carry that film 

the one that tank is the Kellan Lutz version that have terrible effect with even more terrible acting 




 how the hell does I, Frankenstein cost so much money, all the effect in the movie looks cheap as hell 




 they do tweet beheading and mass execution photo 




 maybe buying petrol from the US at market price to give away at almost free price at the gas station is not a good idea?

 why would it not be possible? NK have military unit specificly setup for cyber warfare. there are thousand of trained hackers in NK, south korea have face cyber attack from them for years.

also the NK can hire outside contractor to do the hack or even pay off insider. they got the money from cooking meth to pay those people. 




 when he suit up for the interview, that is Bruce Wayne right there.  




 that is what they mean by not getting theatrical release, movie go straight to video 




 that is because of the plane are first in canada to move to metric. 

in south east asia where this missing plane operate. other than myanmar, everyone have been on metric for decades. why would the same problem happen? 




 if you know how to read mandarin, the comments there would let you know that many of the chinese people are tired of NK's shit. maybe NK also remind them of the dark days of culture revolution with the personality cult. NK is the country they may have become if not for the reform in the 70s.

many call KJU with derogatory name , or fatty kim the third 




 it is only legally available in US and later canada, though it is the hottest movie in china 

http://movie.douban.com/

in china movie website the movie is currently the most discussed film, ahead of Gone Girl 




 dont the major theater chains have policy against showing moview that are on VOD sameday release?  




 The Neutrinos Have Mutated! 

this line was deliver like a serious scientific fact  




 it does not, the small budget movie on limited release will never get the same level of publicity as this movie.

and theater hate same day release on VOD, i believe the big chain have policy to not release movie that are on sameday VOD release

 it is a Indonesian plane that gone missing 




 it is highly unlikely anyone to go missing on a plane. people gone missing on land all the time.  




 so do you go on a car which is much more likely to have fatal accident? 




 not likely, it is in shallow sea and the plane dont have much fuel on it to go into indian ocean. they are going to find it soon 




 if flight are cancelled due to the monsoon and thunderstorm, traveling in the tropic would be a bitch, essentially fight grounded for months at time.

 they re-appeared when the wreckage is found 




 Rodman got totally honeydicked

Skylark represent useful idiot conned into believing all the good thing by a dictator which seen to be a real chill dude. 




 i dont think anyone there would not be so stupid to use their gov controlled internet connection to download it.

they will get it from black market copy of dvd or USB drive that come over from china.  




 but the end was the US agent have been manipulated by the NK honeypot into implementing the NK revolutionary plan, not the CIA plan. 




 i dont see how this is destroying their reputation when they have always been making threats that was never executed.  




 Sony did not even try very hard to DRM their online release.

likely they do it on purpose to let high quality copy swamp the internet 




 of course no mortal can compare to the immortal glorious leader that does not shit 




 they already called SK President a "crafty prostitute" in thrall to her "pimp" Barack Obama.

 




  Nothing gets solved by force

a lot of things are solved by force, most of the border in the world today are settle by war, and many nation only exist because they won their war.

  It'll cost a heck a lot less to solve the issue from the root by properly educating the next generation about religion, faith and the actual lack of scientific evidence about these beliefs.

how are you suppose to do that when ISIS is control of the area and if you open that school to educate the kids of that. the school will be blown up soon and the kids massacred  




 now that is the kind of upstanding organization kids can look up to 




 where did you get this impression, after the hays code ended anti heroes and villain are often the main character in hollywood movie.

taxi driver, godfather, scarface, unsual suspect, LA confidential, se7en, heat, there will be blood ... 




 in some countries, it is required by gov regulation that hero win in the end

 




 foreign film can be much more out there with the tits and bloods.

a example is Cidade de Deus, if Hollywood do a remake of this, they would tone down the violence committed by kids in the movie 




 this are feature of movies from every country, some can be even more over the top than anything hollywood have done.

 




 I have not watch the movie, will I be making a huge mistake if I do? 




 i afraid the south korea will win that game of star craft even when their internet go out, they are just that good 




 Ida is literally porn for photography enthusiast, before i watch it i have doubt about using black and white 4:3 aspect ratio to shoot a modern movie. just a few minutes into it i was amazed by the cinematography and how well it help to tell the story with few dialog.  




 maybe their fax is also under solid black fax attack 




 what make it more plausible is that the world in PR are very much changed by the kaiju war. they show changes that happen to technology, economy and society. 

in Transformers, even after the robots have battled several time in the center of major cities over several years, only minor changes was seen to have happen to daily life of the human character. 




 Clint Eastwood in Unforgiven,

I've killed women and children. I've killed everything that walks or crawls at one time or another. And I'm here to kill you, Little Bill, for what you done to Ned.


All right, I'm coming out. Any man I see out there, I'm gonna shoot him. Any sumbitch takes a shot at me, I'm not only gonna kill him, but I'm gonna kill his wife, all his friends, and burn his damn house down.


the entire final shooting scene is just the most badass shit ever 




 the CGI is much better in PR, there is a real sense of weight behind the robot and monster, you feel the robot running and throwing every punch. 

and every robot and monster are much better designed than transformers. each have different looks and ability that allow you to know which is which instantly. a lot of the robot in transformers looks too much alike. which is very confusing when they fight, especially with the way Bay shot those fight scene. 




 wait, what???? 




 it is a good bet

if they release the movie this week, it will make so much money with all the free publicity 




 did they do unnecessary arrests and summonses before this?

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Snow_White

This project included a series of infiltrations and thefts from 136 government agencies, foreign embassies and consulates, as well as private organizations critical of Scientology, carried out by Church members, in more than 30 countries.[1] It was the single largest infiltration of the United States government in history[2] with up to 5,000 covert agents.[3] This operation also exposed the Scientology plot 'Operation Freakout', because Operation Snow White was the case that initiated the US government investigation of the Church.[3]


Operation Freakout

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Freakout

Operation Freakout, also known as Operation PC Freakout, was a Church of Scientology covert plan intended to have the U.S. author and journalist Paulette Cooper imprisoned or committed to a mental institution. The plan, undertaken in 1976 following years of church-initiated lawsuits and covert harassment, was meant to eliminate the perceived threat that Cooper posed to the church and obtain revenge for her publication in 1971 of a highly critical book, The Scandal of Scientology. The Federal Bureau of Investigation discovered documentary evidence of the plot and the preceding campaign of harassment during an investigation into the Church of Scientology in 1977, eventually leading to the church compensating Cooper in an out-of-court settlement.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/click_online/7525143.stm

The digital remastering process begins by scanning the reels of film, frame by frame at 2,000 pixels across, about the resolution of high definition TV. 

At this resolution the machine can scan 18 frames a second, meaning the film moves through the scanner at about two thirds of the true speed. Every single frame can generate 13MB of data. 
Increasingly, the studios are scanning at 4,000 and even 6,000 pixels across, in order to prepare the films for even higher resolution. 

Scanning at these resolutions generates immense amounts of data - a typical 4,000 pixel film will take up at least 12TB, before any work is done on it. 

Luckily, Warner Bros has a rack of machines which provide one petabyte (1000 terabytes) of storage. 
 




 Hans was suppose to be a good guy in the movie, up to the point they started writing the villain song for Elsa. they sort of mess up the point of the villain song when it resulted in Let it go. but after everyone hear the song they decided to rewrite the rest of the movie to fit the song. poor Hans suddenly become the villain since Elsa can no longer be evil 




 Elsa is actually the key to the nation economic boom, since they export ice, she can mass produce ice right at the port ready for export at every season.

 I am talking about a 8k tv display not a massive screen 




 because 8k is limit of my vision, even when looking very close at the screen I cannot see the pixels. going over 8k would not improve anything.  




 likely not since the 8k tv already cannot see any pixel even when looking very close to the screen. 16k will not look better, maybe in IMAX size screen it will make sense.  




 Hos before Bros. that is just how string roll 




 http://www.forzasilicon.com/2014/04/8k-is-so-last-month-how-about-19k/

 




 8k camera already in use for several years. bluray and dvd master are scanned in 8k.

there are even 16k digital camera already available 




 is selling ridiculously overpriced speaker cables not profitable enough these days? 




 there is different between 4k and 1080p, it is really clear. not as much for between 4k and 8k if you have seen some of those special 8k demo. it may be beyond human vision capability for 16k tv to make sense 




 maybe I should stay out of this update and wait for 8k which are certainly going to be pushed by manufacturer in a few years and will truly be too much resolution for my eye. 




 what is the point of this project with oil at $50 dollar? how much oil will be produced from the tar sands at this price?

 i have seen the effect of chemo and effect of dying from cancer.

Will the Hadron Collider open a gateway to Hell when it turns on in March?

http://metro.co.uk/2015/02/06/will-the-hadron-collider-open-a-gateway-to-hell-when-it-turns-on-in-march-5052153/


The Large Hadron Collider is to switch on its beams at an even higher power this March  and its main goal is to open a gateway into Hell, according to internet maniacs.

The Dark One himself, Lucifer, may even step through and bring catastrophe to our world, YouTuber Freedom Fighter 2127 warns.

The reason for this unusual visit from the Lord of Lies?

CERN officially marked the Year of Light, this week, and inadvertently fanned the bonfire of internet conspiracy  light equals Lucifer, you see.

YourNewsWire reports, Is CERN the most dangerous thing in the cosmos that could lead to the ultimate destruction of the Earth and the entire universe?

Its all preposterous rubbish, of course  based on misreading press releases, and misquoting ancient statements from scientists such as Stephen Hawking  but its an interesting insight into how conspiracy theories start.

Freedom Fighter 2127 says,  They have officially marked this year as the year of light which means the year of Lucifer. So we need to understand just how demonic this year is going to be.

MORE: Is this REALLY a cloud? Mysterious UFO pictures from real X-files fan conspiracy flames

Its part of a long tradition of fear of CERN  which believers claim has a logo mirroring the form of the Indian god of destruction, Shiva.

Nigel Watson, author of the UFO Investigations Manual, says, CERN is linked with all manner of conspiratorial and apocalyptic fears. Clyde Lewis writing in 2012 on the Ground Zero website notes:

Is it just a coincidence that CERN is short for the horned God Cernunnos? Is it also a coincidence that CERN has to go deep underground to do their god harnessing experiments? Cernunnos was the god of the underworld.

Going on to state:

The authorities at CERN have done their ritualistic experiments in the underworld and has used unlimited power to turn against the earth. This power has shown that it is causing an increase in earthquake activity and some even claim that it may be the reason for an increase of UFO activity as well.

Now with the CERN experiments starting up again, the fear that they are set on destroying our planet or at least opening portals to other dimensions unleashing terrors of Biblical proportions are being rekindled on the Internet.

As far back as the 1970s UFO expert Peter Rogerson observed that UFOs are an essential part of a growing fear of our impending global doom:

Thus the UFO is an integral symbol of the growing irrationality with its associated apocalyptophilia of the mid-twentieth century. As the two great monoliths of established religion and scientific positivism are crumbling the vacuum is being filled by horrors from the pages of Tudor history.

As with other perceived horrors of science and technology there is always a belief that they will bring about our ultimate destruction and salvation will only exist for the chosen few. The CERN project rather than Atomic warfare or pollution is now the focus for such fears. Personally I remain unconCERNed.

 doomsday cult mostly survive the revelation of their bullshit prediction, it always re adjust the reading of the prophecy.

 the action scene are a side show in the first three movie, the main point are the underground racing scene, riced up car and muscle car with ridiculous modification and NOS injection, the racing scene become much less important in the 4th movie and by the time the rock join the franchise is full on action movie. 




 maybe they should put him on heel run for a while 




 BBC just lost their top striker Clarkson after the locker room bust up, so they will be easy. 









 seen like just a natural outcome of spring break 




 the franchise itself have completely changed from a street racer movie into action movie by the 4th movie and the addition of the rock make it official.

 is Doha news not a Qatari news outlet?

http://dohanews.co/qatar-marathon-organizers-apologize-after-runners-lament-event-setup/

One runner who contacted Doha News after the event described the marathon as one of the most disorganized and chaotic events I have ever had the displeasure of attending.

That participant observed hundreds of men who appeared to be laborers, wearing jeans, flip-flops or running barefoot.

Others were forced to walk several kilometers before the organizers obviously realized they would not finish, and so they were loaded back into their busses and sent away, the runner said. 




 this is the full objective, quite funny read

Objectives of Qatar Mega Marathon 2015

Organizing Qatar Mega Marathon 2015 comes in sync with the vision of Qatar 2030 and sport is one of its most important pillars. Qatar Mega Marathon will contribute in spreading the awareness of sports, and as a kind of social responsibility that the sports play in the lives of the nationals and expatriates of the State of Qatar. The Marathon will support the majestic march of sports of our beloved country, as Qatar is considered as the region's sports capital.

Mega Marathon Qatar represents a decisive response to the campaign waged by the sector of envious haters on the success of Qatar to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, and to their false allegations of persecution of workers and residents in our beloved country. The Marathon will play an active part in promoting the social role of sport and the ideals and values held in common by the State of Qatar. As the Qatari people, Government and residents have all expressed the wish to present the State of Qatar as active around the world as an outward looking state dedicated to the improvement of relations between nations through sport.


The Marathon objectives can be summed up as follows:

Organizing Qatar Mega Marathon represents our commitment to the vision of His Highness Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani, Emir of the State.

Celebrating the Qatari National Sports Day

The image that the Marathon will show how Qatar encourages the non-discrimination attitude among the nations.
Promote the social role of sport. The Marathon is a unique model for it is not just a race but it embraces historical, educational and cultural associations and possibilities

Emphasize the importance of the participation of people with special needs in social events, and enhance their role in building a healthy and prosperous future for the State of Qatar.

Encouraging the spirit of sharing and volunteering in the social events, in order to fulfill the aspect of social responsibility. As many of the youth will volunteer to guide the runners along the Marathon path
Draw the attention of the West   Arab World to the Qatari athletic vision through its various   distinctive activities.
Attempting to allow Qatar to break the world record and enter Guinness World Records with the Largest Marathon in the world after it was confined to the United States of America.

 actually this marathon happen a few days ago, seen to be not much reporting on it in world media, Doha news have a report on how mess up it was .

 they have HR problem like any company, they even fire people for not following HR policy

http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/05/shortcomings-of-al-qaedas-worst-employee.html

The AP found the copy of the letter to Belmoktar in a building in Mali formerly occupied by Al Qaeda fighters. It details his faults, from failing to file his expense reports to a lack of teamwork. The highlights, below:

Does not work well with others: "Abu Abbas is not willing to follow anyone," AQIM wrote, referring to Belmoktar by his nom de guerre, Khaled Abu Abbas. "He is only willing to be followed and obeyed."

Failed to meet fund-raising targets: Belmoktar's men held Canadian diplomat Robert Fowler and his colleague hostage for four months in 2008. Fowler wrote a book about it. AQIM "referred the case to al-Qaeda central to force concessions in the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan," but Belmoktar made his own deal, releasing both hostages for 700,000 euros, well below the going $3 million rate.

Poor allocation of resources: AQIM's Osama bin Ladenapproved business model was to kidnap tourists and aid workers, hold them for ransom, then use the money to buy arms and carry out attacks. But Belmoktar didn't manage his resources to their satisfaction, per the letter: "(The chapter) gave Abu Abbas a considerable amount of money to buy military material, despite its own great need for money at the time. ... Abu Abbas didn't participate in stepping up to buy weapons," it says. "So whose performance deserves to be called poor in this case, I wonder?"

Insubordination: "He ignored a meeting in Timbuktu, calling it 'useless.' He even ordered his men to refuse to meet with al-Qaida emissaries. And he aired the organization's dirty laundry in online jihadist forums, even while refusing to communicate with the chapter via the Internet, claiming it was insecure."

Failure to achieve performance goals: "Any observer of the armed actions (carried out) in the Sahara will clearly notice the failure of The Masked Brigade to carry out spectacular operations, despite the region's vast possibilities  there are plenty of mujahedeen, funding is available, weapons are widespread and strategic targets are within reach," AP quotes from the letter. "Your brigade did not achieve a single spectacular operation targeting the crusader alliance."

 Do not go gentle into that good night,
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
Because their words had forked no lightning they
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
