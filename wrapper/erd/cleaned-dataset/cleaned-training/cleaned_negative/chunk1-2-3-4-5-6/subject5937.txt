EDIT: [A world map of the measles outbreaks in 2013](http://www.measlesrubellainitiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/mmr_outbreaks_cropped-640x360.png)

Outbreaks are NOT in Central and South America.  




 Yes: "The World Health Organization reported this week that 113 countries, including China, Russia, Iran and Libya, have higher immunization rates than the United States for 1-year-olds."

"data from the World Health Organization shows that measles-vaccination rates in Mexico and Central America are higher than the U.S. rate of 92 percent"

 Compton Rate of Drinking Municipal Water: 93.80% 

Beverly Hills Rate of Buying Bottled Water (that is Actually Municipal Water): 78.33% 




 According to World Health Organization estimates, the U.S. has a measles vaccination rate of 92 percent, while **Mexico and Nicaragua have 99 percent vaccination rates** and Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador each have 93 percent vaccination rates. If anything, those countries should be concerned about Americans coming down to visit.

 Take shells 1 and 2 in your hand, and form them together like a clam shell. Make sure you can grasp with them.

Grab hold of the feces with the shells and pull them out. Continue until all large bits have been removed.

Use shell 3 to scrape (be gentle!) and remove anything you might have missed.

Wash (or flush) the shells, wash your bottom with warm water. 




  when professionals mix their personal advice in with their professional advice

This is their profession. XYZ Healing Arts practitioners offer a wide range of therapies for healing body and mind including: Acupuncture, Chiropractic, Homeopathy, Massage Therapy, Physical Therapy.

I went in for Chiropractic, Massage and Physical Therapy and they did a great job. Thus I just tolerated the homeopathic advice.  




 Since I made the above post, I read other posts and analysis.

The "Memorandum" is not a treaty - it is an agreement.

In the case of aggression, the remedy "if Ukraine should become a victim of *an act of aggression* or *an object of a threat of aggression in which nuclear weapons are used*" is to seek immediate United Nations Security Council action to provide assistance to Ukraine.

Morally I believe the U.S. made a commitment that it needs to keep. 




 If you Google "nightshade foods" you will find many suggestion that they can cause indigestion (and other intestinal issues) and joint pain. Since I was pretty shaken up in the car accident he recommended avoiding nightshades  - at least until my back recovered (which it did - I'm fine now). He did great physical therapy work, so I politely tolerated his homeopathy suggestions.  




  translation into different languages

If you want a real answer, I would suggest calling a librarian. They are amazing with topics like this, and they generally love the chance to answer questions like this.  




 Nightshade also includes eggplant and tobacco. I had a physical therapist (after an auto accident) tell me to avoid all nightshades. F*** that - I love them all way too much. 




 I don't know, but I'm guessing there are many translations.

You can get free e-book versions since it's in the public domain. 




 The "Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances" is a diplomatic memorandum signed in December 1994 by Ukraine, Russia, the United States, and the United Kingdom under which signatories made promises to each other as part of the denuclearization of former Soviet republics after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Ukraine promised to remove all nuclear weapons, and kept this promise.

In return, Russia and the Western signatory countries essentially consecrated the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine as an independent state. In the "Budapest Memorandum," Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States promised that none of them would ever threaten or use force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine. They also pledged that none of them would ever use economic coercion to subordinate Ukraine to their own interest. They also pledged to protect Ukraine if its security was threatened.  




 Meat with nightshade - a Shakespearean pizza  




 When post-Cold War Ukraine gained independence, it held the worlds third-largest stockpile of nuclear weapons. Rather than use nukes for protection, Ukraine sought and received assurances from the international community that its borders would be respected if it gave up its nuclear weapons. In 1994, the U.S., United Kingdom and Russia signed the Budapest Memorandum, in which **all sides pledged to respect Ukraines territorial integrity, refrain from using military force or economic pressure to limit Ukrainian sovereignty and provide assistance to Ukraine if it became the victim of aggression from another nation**.

Obviously, Russia has broken its part of that agreement. Now the question is whether the US will break theirs.

**If the U.S. breaks their word, they should consider the devastating impact on American counter proliferation efforts around the world**. How could any nation ever trust U.S. security assurances if they see, in the carnage and destruction in Ukraine, **the deadly folly of trading nuclear weapons for American guarantees**?

After being unable to save two hostages held by Middle Eastern extremists, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said constitutional change will be needed to protect the lives and assets of Japanese citizens.

Abe has said at times that with the current interpretation of Article 9, which forbids both the use of force to settle international disputes and the maintenance of regular armed forces, it is difficult to protect Japanese citizens in a changing security environment.

The Liberal Democratic Party has already presented a draft amendment to Article 9, and amending it is to carry out our duty of protecting the lives and assets of Japanese citizens, Abe told the Upper House Budget Committee on Tuesday.

 A recent study showed that it is natural for nostrils to have differing air intake volumes under normal conditions. The findings suggest this aids in identification of scents, as the reactions occur differently at a higher volume and an lower volume.

Edit: [Nature.com Article](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v402/n6757/full/402035a0.html)

"The flow of air is greater into one nostril than into the other because there is a slight turbinate swelling in one. The nostril that takes in more air switches from the left to the right one and back again every few hours, but the effect of this switching on the sense of smell has been unclear. Here we show that this difference in airflow between the nostrils causes each nostril to be optimally sensitized to different odorants, so that each nostril conveys a slightly different olfactory image to the brain."

 Just the opposite. "Texas seceded from the United States in 1861, and joined the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. It replaced the pro-Union governor, Sam Houston, in the process. During the war, slavery in Texas was little affected, and prices for slaves remained high until the last few months of the war. The number of slaves in the state increased dramatically as the Union Army occupied parts of Arkansas and Louisiana. Slaveholders in those areas often moved their slaves to Texas to avoid having them emancipated. By 1865 there were an estimated 250,000 slaves in Texas."

 "Doxing" is a neologism that has evolved over its brief history.

Essentially, doxing is revealing and releasing records of an individual, which were previously private, to the public.

 Kenebrew is represented by civil rights attorney Hank Sherrod, who last year represented Robert Bryant of Kelso, Tennessee.

Sherrod argued that Madison County deputies in the summer of 2012 conspired to stalk, beat and falsely arrest Bryant. Bryant sued Sheriff Dorning and eight deputies, including Countess, in federal court last year.

The county settled with Bryant for $625,000 last year and the FBI then announced it was investigating the deputies.

This lawsuit invokes the Bryant case and related newspaper articles to argue that Dorning and the Madison County Sheriff's Department have a record of ignoring or even covering up police misconduct.

"Deputies under [Sheriff] Dorning's command have learned that their justifications for using force and other unlawful actions will never be questioned," reads the Kenebrew suit, "and that they can act with impunity."

 There are 10 of these disturbing fairy tales in the article.

**Sleeping Beauty** - In one of the very earliest versions of this classic story, published in 1634 by Giambattista Basile as Sun, Moon, and Talia, the princess does not prick her finger on a spindle, but rather gets a sliver of flax stuck under her fingernail. She falls down, apparently dead, but her father cannot face the idea of losing her, so he lays her body on a bed in one of his estates. Later, a king out hunting in the woods finds her, and since he cant wake her up, rapes her while shes unconscious, then heads home to his own country. Some time after that, still unconscious, she gives birth to two children, and one of them accidentally sucks the splinter out of her finger, so she wakes up. The king who raped her is already married, but he burns his wife alive so he and Talia can be together. Dont worry, the wife tries to kill and eat the babies first, so its all morally sound.

 Vintage [Ayatollah toilet paper](http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQzOVgxMzE4/z/a38AAMXQlgtStdHa/$_35.JPG) 




  according to the CDC 86 cases of measles were reported in the year 2000. ... The whole measles thing by itself is a joke and not a real threat to America.

[From January 1 to January 30, 2015, 102 people from 14 states were reported to have measles](http://www.cdc.gov/measles/cases-outbreaks.html)
"The United States experienced a record number of measles cases **during 2014, with 644 cases from 27 states reported to CDC**'s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD). This is the greatest number of cases since measles elimination was documented in the U.S. in 2000."

* The majority of the people who got measles were unvaccinated.
* Measles is still common in many parts of the world including countries in Europe, Asia, the Pacific, and Africa.
* Travelers with measles continue to bring the disease into the U.S.
* Measles can spread when it reaches a community in the U.S. where groups of people are unvaccinated.

[Chart: US Measles Cases by Year](http://www.cdc.gov/measles/images/measles-cases-616px.jpg) 




 Did you look at the [World Map of the measles outbreaks in 2013](http://www.measlesrubellainitiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/mmr_outbreaks_cropped-640x360.png)?

It's not about skin color - it's about geography.  




 No - the contagion vectors come from outside the Americas.

The spread is due to pools of non-immunized children that are exposed and quickly transmit it to others.

If the children were immunized, the virus brought in from Europe or Africa would not spread.  




 Here's some of the misinformation being spread: 

**Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.)** said individuals who come to the U.S. illegally may be responsible for the recent measles outbreak, contending they dont undergo the stringent health screening others do when they enter the country. I dont think there is any health care professional who has examined the facts who could honestly say that Americans have not died because the disease is brought into America by illegal aliens who are not properly health care screened as lawful immigrants are.

**Rush Limbaugh** - The children coming across the southern U.S. border "were never examined after they got here and quarantined if they had a disease. They were just sent out across the country. Many of them had measles ... We now have an outbreak of it all because of our immigration policy."
 









 Curry, Yes - if the execution is within a few hours of the meal, then **bring it on hot and spicy**.

A) Execution goes as scheduled - so **no "curry bum" to worry about**

B) Stay of execution - **the happiest I've ever been to have red hot curry shits** 




 The most deadly animal in the world is the mosquito. It might seem impossible that something so minuscule can kill so many people, but mosquito bites result in the deaths of more than 1 million people every year.

First, we did not have adequate numbers to examine suicide trends in some specific subgroups 

Second, changes in cause of death coding might have affected our findings, 

Third, the study was not designed to determine whether changes in suicide rates in black and white children corresponded to periods of change in risk factors for suicide. 

Fourth, it is **unknown whether the accuracy of classification of a death as suicide in children has changed during the study**

 If you are only married 6 years, I believe there *usually* is not alimony (depends on which state). If you were married 10+ years then absolutely. 

If you have a child then absolutely to child support regardless of length of relationship (or even if you were married or not).

 **Tater Tots** - those were always the best!

 The purpose of the student loan is to provide future benefit (the fruits of the education). Since the ex-spouse will not be able to participate in the future benefit, both statues and court rulings state that, in general, student loans within a marriage are individual debts, not joint debts. There are exceptions, but that is the rule.

Example: If my wife puts me through medical school with $250,000 in student loans, then after 6 years of marriage I divorce her, she does NOT have to pay any of the loans since they will only benefit me - - via future income. 




 I feel a little guilty saying this, but in the grand scheme of things, the loss of our planet's cultural heritage, history, and sites such is this makes me at least as angry as the loss of life.

**Destruction of cultural heritege should be a war crime**. 




 If you watch it in reverse, it's a snail blowing a bubble.  




 THAT - that I have to try! 




 If you are married almost all debts are joint - regardless if the spouse co-signed.

Student loans are one of the few debts that aren't joint within a marriage.  




 Without my knowledge my wife (now Ex) took out $75k in student loans, then filed for divorce.

She honestly thought I would have to pay them.

She took out another $25K+ during the separation and tried to get me to pay that as well.

Oh yah . . . her "degree" is in Children's Literature. Good luck paying of that $100K loan!

 Images released by the U.S. Committee for Human Rights in North Korea this week appears to show several individuals standing in front of anti-aircraft machine guns at a military training area 13 miles north of Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, around Oct. 7, 2014.

It appears that these people are being executed. 









 [North Korea executes with anti-aircraft guns?](http://i.imgur.com/KGrUtok.jpg)

"Images released by the U.S. Committee for Human Rights in North Korea this week appears to show several individuals standing in front of anti-aircraft machine guns at a military training area 13 miles north of Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, around  Oct. 7, 2014.

It appears, though it cannot be confirmed, that these people are being executed." 









 I don't think so. If that were the case, you would commit a crime if:

I email you child porn as an attachment (the image would be on your PC)

I sneak onto your PC and download the file "train_subject5937 Child Porn" that contains illegal images.

In both cases, the illegal child porn is on your PC, but you have no intent and have not committed a crime - - but I would have. 




 The intent and the individual's actions are very different in the two cases.

1. If Googling "impact of child porn on society" resulted in images being cached, it would be hard to prove intent to download the illegal porn.

2. If in addition, you right click on the child porn and "save image as", then you have clear intent. 




  if you search for it and you see the image hosted on a website 

The Google Search would be within your browser (not actually going to another website). Now, if the browser caches the images to your hard drive, and they remain there, that might be a gray area if a search of your PC was done and they were found. I think you could beat the charges since, by doing a Google search with your browser, you did not intend to, and did not actively download the pictures. 

Source: I'm not a lawyer, but I play one on the Internets.  




  only if you find some

I don't think finding child porn would be illegal. DOWNLOADING it would be illegal. Thus, the search would not be a crime, the act of downloading it would.

(Source - I live in the SF bay area. Talk radio man Bernie Ward went to prison for his child porn "research". He downloaded.) 




 It's tough work finding that path - - keep trying. And creating a budget (and following it) helps. 

A strict budget is the only way I could have made it through college with almost no debt.

 Then work hard to either decrease expenses, or increase income (or both) so you can create a larger cushion. 

I'm not trying to bust your balls, but seriously, the security of creating (1) a safety net and (2) savings for the future, will reduce stress and make life much more enjoyable.  




 I think there is a distinction between being a crime, and supporting criminal charges.

1. Clearly a search could be evidence in support of criminal charges (e.g. "how to dissolve a body with lye")

2. Under the Patriot Act, repeated searches on the President's travel plans, combined with searches to hire an assassin, etc. might be prosecutable.  

Other than the Patriot Act or threats on the President, I have a hard time seeing when a search, or even a pattern of searches would be a crime. 




 U.S. News and the Internet site Beliefnet funded a poll to learn more about why, how, where and when people pray. Here is a summary of the findings: 

 75% percent were Christian. 

 64% say they pray more than once a day.

 56% say they most often pray for family members, with 3.3% saying that they pray for strangers.

 A little over 38% say that the most important purpose of prayer is intimacy with God.

 41% say that their prayers are answered often.

 1.5% say that their prayers are never answered.

 Over 73% say when their prayers are not answered, the most important reason is because they did not fit Gods plan.

 5% say that they pray most often in a house of worship.

 79% say that they pray most often at home.

 67% say that in the past six months, their prayers have related to continually giving thanks to God. (Pastors Weekly Briefing, 12/24/04)
 




  Blessings require some work or effort on our part before we can obtain them. Prayer is a form of work and is an appointed means for obtaining the highest of all blessings.

 Legal experts said they're often surprised that people who comment online, even younger Internet users who've grown up online, seem to believe they're protected.

"In my experience with speaking with groups, and even speaking with some students, they seem to believe they will be protected when they speak on the Internet because they choose to use some fictitious name," Tulane University law professor Amy Gajda said.

Illinois' opinion was based in large part on a pair of earlier, lower-court decisions in the state, which held that the anonymity of someone who makes comments in response to online news stories isn't guaranteed if their opinions are potentially defamatory, according to Don Craven, an attorney for the Illinois Press Association.

  So every time a gang banger shoots at more than one person that's a mass shooting

This list is 4 or more shooting victims in one incident. If you dropped down to 2 or more the list would be enormous.  




 "Police say an overnight shooting in Savannah left one man dead and sent four other people to a hospital early Friday. Two of the shooting victims are children."

Yes, that is a mass shooting. 




 No - that is the definition of mass murder, not mass shooting.

For example, "in 2012, Travis Steed and others shot 18 people total. Miraculously, he only killed one. Under the incorrect definition of mass shooting, that event would not be considered a mass shooting! Arguing that 18 people shot during one event is not a mass shooting is absurd." 




 [Here is a list of sources for almost all of them](http://shootingtracker.com/wiki/Mass_Shootings_in_2015#cite_note-2)

The requirement for the list is that **four or more people are shot in a spree or setting**

Five people were injured after being shot on a party bus traveling down Interstate 240 early New Year's Day.

The party bus drove to the Baptist East emergency room with five victims. **Two people were in extremely critical condition**.

(a quick Google found that one - I'll let you do the rest) 




 After reading this list, THAT was your reaction?

NO, many bullets hitting someone are:

Suicides

A child accidentally shooting a sibling, parent or friend

A gun owner surprised by a spouse, housemate or family member coming home

And many, many other single victim shootings.

  Unfortunately most authors of such books are writing from the perspective that the USA only ever acts honestly, fairly and with appropriate consideration for everyone

As TIME editor-at-large and president of Eurasia group Ian Bremmer is more nuanced than "most".

[Here's an interview that give's a sense of Bremmer's approach](http://time.com/3843599/ian-bremmer-united-states-superpower-china/) 




 Ian Bremmers book "Three Choices for America's Role in the World" lays out these options:

**Independent America** argues that its time for Washington to declare independence from the responsibility to solve everyone elses problems. Instead, America should lead by example by investing in Americas enormous untapped potential.

**Moneyball America**  acknowledges that we cant manage every international challenge but asserts that we must defend U.S. interests wherever theyre threatened. Like the Oakland As general manager Billy Beane spending scarce capital only where it offered the most promising return.
 
**Indispensable America** insists that only Washington can promote the values on which global stability increasingly depends in our hyper-connected world. Turning inward would threaten Americas security and prosperity. 




 There's a big difference between "Zero Tolerance" and "One Punishment Fits All".

I don't have a problem with zero tolerance, as long as the punishment fits the crime. 

I do have a problem with punishing all violations in the same way.

This prank should not be tolerated (zero tolerance) but it should have a punishment that fits the crime, such as time spent contributing back to the school.

TLDR: **Zero Tolerance** can work if **The Punishment Fits The Crime**

 "Government by cliff is a recipe for disaster."

That's a quote from Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), not Rand Paul, though the two have long agreed about this principle. The Patriot Act expires at the end of May. "It's been three years since we've known this date is coming," Paul said. Why in hell hasnt there been a debate, with amendments, in the Senate? Why does Capitol Hill lurch from cliff to cliff, instead of actually do the job of governing?  




 FBI Director James Comey warned on Wednesday  Letting key portions of the Patriot Act expire at the end of the month would make it harder for the FBI to do its job.

 "This study seeks to look beyond the use of radiation pressure for thrust, and to explore a means of solar navigation whereby a solar craft would be steered by use of radiation pressure. The idea is based on a recent discovery by the study team. They found that transparent refractive objects may settle into a position where they feel a force that is perpendicular to the incoming light direction. This transverse force is akin to the lift experience by an airplane wing and other airfoils. Thus they call it optical lift. Objects in their experiments simultaneously thrust forward. The combination of lift and thrust allows for the optical steering of optical wings. In the coming year they will conduct experiments and computer modeling to advance this discovery for future space missions employing solar sails. The long-term goal is to devise a means to allow solar sails to navigate through space using only the power of sunlight. In the short term they will design and fabricate small-scale arrays of optical wings and test them in the laboratory to demonstrate the feasibility of the concept. They will also perform numerical modeling to determine optimal design parameters for optical wings."

 Similar thing happened many years ago in my town on a pedestrian/bike overpass walkway. The kid on the bike died. I don't recall if they caught the guy who strung the wire. 




 I remember I had a great time, but I can't even remember which concert that was. I didn't care. I had another job in a week or so. 




 [The **Brazen Bull**,](http://www.worldmysteries.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/the-Brazen-Bull.jpg) bronze bull, or Sicilian bull, was a torture and execution device designed in ancient Greece. Perillos of Athens invented and proposed it to Phalaris, the tyrant of Akragas, Sicily, as a new means of executing criminals. The bull was made entirely of bronze, hollow, with a door in one side. The bull was in the form and size of an actual bull and had an acoustic apparatus that converted screams into the sound of a bull. The condemned were locked in the device, and a fire was set under it, heating the metal until the person inside roasted to death. 




 I wanted to go to a concert so I traded shifts and bought the tickets. After that the manager said "new policy - no trading shifts." I explained that I already arranged it before the new policy. He said I had to choose between the job and the concert.

It was a great concert.

 The TPP gives private corporations new tools to undermine national sovereignty and democratic processes. Specifically, TPP would give multinational companies the power to sue countries over laws that  might diminish the value of their company or cut into their expected future profits.Critics understand that this redrawing of the boundaries of copyright law by the globalists secretly deliberating and drafting the TPP is an attack on our laws, our courts, our freedom of expression, our Constitution, and our sovereignty.  




 Immaculate deception  




 I agree. By "America" I meant the majority of Americans. 

What a majority of Americans want is much less influential on enacted policy than what donors and lobbyists demand.

 




 There is a large difference between what the general American population wants, and what our "representatives" do. Research shows that popular opposition to (or support for) a policy has a small effect in a majority  of cases. However, support/opposition from a much smaller constituency of "influential" entities has significant effect. This small minority of wealthy contributors, (individual, corporate, PACs, etc.) and lobbyists has a much greater impact on US policy. 

TLDR: What a majority of Americans want is much less influential on enacted policy than what donors and lobbyists demand.  




 I agree - Iran will stay the course and just keep delaying.

PS - The earliest predecessor of the game of chess probably originated in India, before the 6th century AD; a minority of historians believe the game originated in China. From India, the game spread to Persia. When the Arabs conquered Persia, chess was taken up by the Muslim world and subsequently spread to Southern Europe.

They did invent the first human civilization, and the first empire in the world, the Persian Empire.

  tensions between Mexican and American students, past events, Judge M. Margaret McKeown wrote, "made it reasonable for school officials to proceed as though the threat of a potentially violent disturbance was real."

Dress codes in schools have repeatedly been upheld - as have searches that would not be legal if conducted outside of a school.

If you want more rights at school, try home school. At a public school you are a minor within a govt. institution.  




 In my city in CA we just voted down a special election sales tax increase for "infrastructure" that had too many loopholes.

A month later they pass a general budget with funding for many special pet projects but NOTHING for infrastructure. 

I guess they don't get reelected running on "no bridges fell down on my watch".

Without humans, does math exist? I'm just asking (and apparently pissing off Redditors by asking). 




 I have to admit, I was a bit flippant in my phrasing. That said, I didn't expect this level of piling on without interest in intellectual pursuit. Especially in a post about mathematical proofs. Very ironic.  




 I have found the downvotes without cogent supporting arguments to be disappointing. Of course I have only myself to blame.  




 Right now I'm thinking a Rubio vs. Sanders election would be very interesting.

 Mathematics and music, the most sharply contrasted fields of scientific activity which can be found,

but the unconscious expressions of a mysteriously acting rationality. 19th century German physician and physicist Hermann von Helmholtz

 As a metaphysical solipsist, I disagree. In fact, my self is the only existing reality and all other reality, including the external world and other persons, and Reddit are representations of my self, and have no independent existence. I am all that exists.  




 In addition, new drivers should follow the 4 second rule. When the car in front of you drives over a paint line, count slowly to 4. If you pass it before 4, you are following too close.

Yes, this means others will pass you and merge into that space - which can be annoying.

But it's not as annoying as causing an accident when the car in front brakes quickly and you're not prepared.

 At year 5 it's sunk cost. But how do you decide year after year for 40+ years to pay the bill for a freeze full of meat with diminishing value.

That is real cost, plus opportunity cost.  




 Knowledge of anything outside my own mind is unsure.  The external world and other minds cannot be known for sure and might not even exist outside of my mind. The universe, the world and other minds may not exist, and I have no way of proving that they do.

You kind Redditor are likely a construct of my mind which is simply creating an illusionary universe as a form of amusement.  




 It's like looking at the ocean and seeing a division between the sand and the ocean. But the "division" doesn't really exist. The beach exists, and the ocean exists, but the "division" is an illusion.

Similarly, there is no "present". It is an illusion of our senses interpreting what has happened in the past few minutes, seconds, milliseconds, etc. . . . in anticipation of what is to come in the future. 




 No thanks. I've already got a bitch that treats me like a god. She's a rescue, so some behavior will always be a mystery, but that's a small price for unconditional love.

 Math is a man-made construct and is a complete illusion.

There is no physical proof that math actually exists. 

Edit 1 - After several downvotes I have seen no response with an argument as to why we should see math as a given feature of the universe rather than simply a human creation. The downvotes without responses make me more convinced that I am correct. If I could come up with a counter argument, I would. 

Edit 2 - Since I was finally asked below for proof of my position, you can take a look at [this entertaining and very well thought out video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbNymweHW4E feature=youtu.be) 




 It's safe. It is simply a reply to /u/hurdur1

 The [Brazen Bull](http://cdn8.openculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/brazen-bull.jpg) 









 When I have a great interaction as a customer, I make sure I get their name, and then . . . 

- As I walk to my car I use Maps.Google.com to get the store/restaurant phone #

- I immediately call on speaker phone so I can do it NOW while I'm driving and it costs me no time

- I ask to speak to the Mgr, and say "Hey, you need to know what just happened with one of your employees . . ."

- As they brace for yet another complaint, I hit them with how fantastic Jane was (and why), and it's people like this that make me a loyal customer.

I guarantee: you, the manager, and the employee will all have a better day because you took the time. 

Edit: I thought about it, and I agree that an email, if you really will take the time, is even better since it creates a permanent record. I will now do both. 




  why you do bank on the hypothesis of a successful uprising

Did you even read my posts? I clearly stated:

"And, to be clear, Jang Jin-sung said the internal solution is "the forces of the market", not an overthrow of the government."

Attempting to converse with you is pointless. I'm out.  




 Thank you for the correction and additional info. 

I heard about this on a radio program and it was absolutely frightening. 

To be dismissed as dead, as you hear everything around you, with no way to break through, and to live that way for years, that would be crazy making.

 I skimmed the article, and here are some snippets: 

**Operation Uranus**: encirclement of the German Sixth Army to envelop German Army and Romanian headlong. Soviet troops were not without problems, due to commonly arriving late. Soviet forces on Axis forces, German reserves were not strong enough to parry the Soviet spearheads, did not react quickly enough to disengage. Soviet forces linked up encircling some men instead of attempting to break out of the encirclement.

  the US is due for a fascist dictator . . .  LIBERALS are thankfully preventing that

No, capitalists are preventing that. The wealthy and the corporations are in charge and have the most influence on who gets elected and on what policies are enacted.

 My library even has a flier describing how to copy the file so it never expires . . . AKA piracy.  




 "The airline purchased an additional 23 safety lanyards following the accident and reinforced procedures for their optional use."

What are these "safety lanyards" and how would they prevent this? 




  Military intervention? Covert ops? Peaceful dialogue between the two Koreas?

Do you really think any country is going to invade NK? And if they did, that NK wouldn't detonate nuclear bombs before facing defeat? In reality it wouldn't get that far since China would step in immediately. 

Covert ops? You don't think that was tried as NK was developing their nuclear program? It was. It failed.

"Peaceful ..." NK is still at war. There is no "peace" yet, and they have NO interest in pursuing peace. So, good luck there.

And, to be clear, Jang Jin-sung said the internal solution is "the forces of the market", not an overthrow of the government. 

I have no solutions other than shaming China into either owning the problem, or getting out of the way of others that want to "influence" the situation.  




 They would never go to prison. They would simply be charged, booked, and spend a few hours in jail before being released pending a plea deal (or, very unlikely, a trial if the prosecutor really wants to make an example of them - not likely).

For their beliefs - absolutely NOT.

For illegal actions ABSOLUTELY.

These clerks with convictions have 2 simple remedies: do your job, or work elsewhere.

Please, do tell. 




 Well played, and very good point.

North Korea confounds me beyond any other country. I have no clue what the right approach might be.

I hate the regime, and my heart goes out to the people. 

From what I've read, I don't think an externally imposed solution makes sense. 

Given that, I see alternatives of (a) status quo, or (b) internal change.

I quoted Jang Jin-sung because I also believe that the change must come from within.  




 If I had to vote right now - I would hold my nose and vote Hillary. 

That said, I don't trust her poll driven "convictions", and I don't think I am alone.

That is why I'm looking/hoping for viable alternatives to step up in the Dem party. 




 I guess I'll just let go, 'cause  . . .

Why did I have to act so mean?

Don't I know I'm human being?

Born of a mother with the love of a father

Reflections come and reflections go

I know sometimes I wanna let go

 Any publicity is good publicity as long as they spell your name right. 




 Jang Jin-sung says stop funding food aid:

North Korean exiles will tell you that the international community must stop funding food aid. We say this not out of spite with regard to a nation whose leadership invests in luxuries, nuclear tests and missile launches while the welfare of its subjects remains low among its priorities. We say this for pragmatic and humanitarian reasons, because the assumptions that lie behind funding food aid have hindered economic reform in our homeland, not helped it.

Today, the fatal threat for the regime lies not in the outside world, but within the country itself. More specifically, this is the jangmadang  an underground economy arisen from the ashes of economic collapse in the 1990s, and which consist of market activities taking place beyond the remit of the regimes control mechanisms.

In todays North Korea there are two rival forces in battle: the forces of the regime and the forces of the market. The formers interests are better served by the maintenance of existing party, military and surveillance mechanisms of control. The latter are equivalent to North Koreas progressives, who believe in a future that is possible beyond the absolute, stifling and structurally inhumane confines of the regime.

An international community wishing to assist the North Korean people should recognise that funding food aid is a channel of limited efficiency. The majority of North Koreans depend not on the regimes munificence but on market forces  they have already found this a more successful alternative, despite a disproportionate lack of international support or awareness.

Jang Jin-sung was one of Kim Jong-ils favourite state poets until he defected in 2004. He founded the North Korea news website New Focus International

 Elizabeth Warren for VP !!! 




 More than you know fellow Redditor . . . more than you know. 




 "The boy and his mother had been at the park since Wednesday morning, Richardson said. Police found them Friday."

Clearly a tragic situation and outcome.

But ... HOW? ... Did she sleep at night, then go back to . . .

Just scary to even think about. 




 I find it hard to believe that **racism** and **hate crimes** are not involved here. 




 Yah, like I'm supposed to believe that. 




  you are cherry-picking

So posting current YTD and prior year (past 18 months) performance fits your definition of "cherry-picking"?

As an investor, I respectfully disagree.  




 Put your feet in ice water.

 Trump is an **ASS-HAT!** . . . No wait, maybe that's his hair. 




 Fap 




 Thank you for putting this out there. Schwarzenegger is an ass. Very successful, but still an a-hole. 

Judge Lloyd Connelly called Schwarzenegger's decision to reduce Esteban Nunez's sentence from 16 years to seven years distasteful and "repugnant to the bulk of the citizenry of this state," but within his executive powers as governor.

 I hate to say it, but I have come to believe that Europe and the US are going to let Putin take significant amounts of territory from the Ukraine - permanently.

 This is such bullshit! Another blow to freedom.

Judge Michael Mosman of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court ruled late on Monday that the Second Circuit was wrong and that the program could resume.

"Second Circuit rulings are not binding on the F.I.S.C. and this court respectfully disagrees with that courts analysis, especially in view of the intervening enactment of the U.S.A. Freedom Act," he wrote. 




 Flying kites at the beach. 




 The sounds were accompanied by a shock wave that knocked people off their feet and broke windows hundreds of kilometres away. The majority of witnesses reported only the sounds and the tremors, and did not report seeing the explosion. The explosion registered at seismic stations across Eurasia. It is estimated that, in some places, the resulting shock wave was equivalent to an earthquake measuring 5.0 on the Richter scale. It also produced fluctuations in atmospheric pressure strong enough to be detected in Great Britain.

 The Investor-State Dispute Settlement, or ISDS is [*The Trans-Pacific Partnership clause everyone should oppose*](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/kill-the-dispute-settlement-language-in-the-trans-pacific-partnership/2015/02/25/ec7705a2-bd1e-11e4-b274-e5209a3bc9a9_story.html) (By Elizabeth Warren February 25)

ISDS would allow foreign companies to challenge U.S. laws  and potentially to pick up huge payouts from taxpayers  without ever stepping foot in a U.S. court. Heres how it would work. Imagine that the United States bans a toxic chemical that is often added to gasoline because of its health and environmental consequences. If a foreign company that makes the toxic chemical opposes the law, it would normally have to challenge it in a U.S. court. But with ISDS, the company could skip the U.S. courts and go before an international panel of arbitrators. If the company won, the ruling couldnt be challenged in U.S. courts, and the arbitration panel could require American taxpayers to cough up millions  and even billions  of dollars in damages.
