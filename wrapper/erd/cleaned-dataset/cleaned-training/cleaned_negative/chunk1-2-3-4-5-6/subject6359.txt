 those classes aren't about actually learning art. they're about having fun and that's exactly what this guy did. 




 it makes no sense to me that everybody on here is claiming they have no problem with growth hormone and then simultaneously downvoting you for saying you wish it were socially acceptable. 




 his point is that nobody can deny that steroids are taboo among the vast majority of people and he's definitely right. he's just saying he wishes it wasn't the case and all you people are advocating hgh and then downvoting this guy for saying he wishes it were socially acceptable and that makes absolutely no sense regardless of where you stand on the issue.

 reminded me of the automatic pilot from Airplane 




 First off, I got my car brand new. this is in response to the guy who followed the car thief because he recognized the car from Facebook. Do people still steal newer cars? Can you get around the system and get different plates or if the theif sells, does the buyer then just drive the car unregistered to his name because I would think when you register it they'd catch you. I can't understand how stealing a car is worth the trouble.

 You are goddamn right. 




 THATS MY FUCKING COMMENT. BlockoManWINS is my other account.  




 think of it this way. when you have no friends you can wear a cloak out in public and not have to worry what people think. honestly cloaks look warm and comfortable as fuck. 




 I don't understand why your comment is acceptable and mine is not 




 got a place near there. I will definitely be keeping my eyes peeled! 




 infiniti logo is not just a circle with a triangle missing. it's a road going off into the distance. another obvious thing that took me ages to notice.

 there's no way this car is real. it's too beautiful. definitely just an urban legend.

 I made a sticky and sparten did a self post. everyone who bothered to respond liked it. 




 can confirm. One of those was me. 




 I'm not saying what he did was ok but you literally cannot mention his name now without an army of self righteous fucks suddenly pretending that they are above being upset about this. he was the carpet in the Big Lebowski. he held the show together which is why he did all the celebrity interviews. we are all sad that top gear as we know it is gone and it's oh so reassuring to me that people are so quick to demonize someone that they loved for so long. I'm done arguing about this. 




 so ALL those years of entertainment he gave you mean nothing because he made one mistake. because you're perfect and have never made a mistake. got it. 




 how about next time you leave constructive criticism instead of being passive aggresive

 I could see aquaman driving that 




 it was from a  post about sports so manly that they aren't in the Olympics or something. the guy is standing on a plank of wood being pulled by a 2 cowpower engine through some mud. the Scottish tree throwing thing was in there too.

 yeah with creepy statues and like... poems carved into trees. would be so cool 




 there are a couple issues with the font. text fields for submitting posts and the drop-down menu for "my subreddits" are too light so the font is hard to see. if I post the code will someone take a look at it?

 I tried to do that to mine and hed pee in the litter box but then hed perk his ears and launch himelf out, kicking litter everywhere, and sprint up to my roommates door where hed leave a pile of poo and just lay. I think he was just a jerk. 




 I watched a couple of them and he is extremely annoying. everything he says is redundant. it's a shame because I really like the videos otherwise 




 aw you jerks I just saw this today and was going to post it 
























 if I ever go bald I am going to march right over to gods house and take a poo on his sofa. 




 my dad was a weaver

 and now that dad is in jail nothing can take that away from us! 




 I won't claim to know how an octopus tank size effects its stress level I'm just saying that its intelligence won't have anything to do with the argument. it's a sedentary animal so if all its needs are accounted for it will stay put whereas a tang is highly energetic. it's like having a small apartment and putting a sleepy dog vs a nutty dog in it. they could be the same breed but the nutty one will be stressed and the sleepy one won't be bothered. 




 how does that make any sense? an animals territory size is in no way related to its intelligence. the only reason an octopus moves at all is to find food or mate. 




 I have an exam tomorrow and I'm going to get less than 5 hours of sleep thanks to OP. ain't even mad. 




 I'm down. let's bring a bunch of booze and figure out a way to turn this into the ultimate drinking game?

 I shall die in a pool of vomit, convulsing on the floor from heart failure but happy nonetheless 




 awww thank you sweetie I love me too :) 




 I'm going to make these for me because I love me so much :) 




 bb I'm bout to plug dis dongle in and charge u RIGHT up (    ) 




 and then a cartoon series based on the toy 




 how does this relate? particle accelerators are not that hard to understand. In fact I will explain to you right now how they work: shit is magic. 




 could you not? id like to keep my methods on the down low until it's published. 




 actually mammatus comes from the same root as mammary because these clouds looked like boobs to whoever named them. 




 I don't understand people like you. that's literally 1 bite of food. I have friends who will eat a hamburger and leave the LAST bite to waste and it makes me go ape shit. 




 it didn't smell at all it was just the taste. it's one of those things that I can see why people would like it but for the price id rather just have tuna or tako 




 marinade it first. delicious. 




 go to Greek Islands and try their octopus. it is absolutely phenomenal. my mom tells me that when I was a kid I refused to eat anything except pb j, hamburgers, and cold octopus salad 




 no way man the texture was great but it tastes the way a tidepool smells. oddly charming but all in all just bad. 




 an identified driving object? 




 my brain is struggling to turn that into a sex joke 




 incorrect. train_subject6359 shifts significantly faster with an average shift time of approximately 0ms. some say he shifts so fast that his lap times are negative. 




 I don't know that there is a wrong way to use it. 




 was he doing curls on the calf machine and going TSATT. HUNNNHHHH with every rep because if so I think you nailed it. 




 go buy as many lottery tickets as you can afford. someone upstairs has your back today. 




 I did a study the other day which conclusively proved that I don't like diet soda as much as I like regular soda and therefore regular is better. still waiting to hear back from the new England journal of medicine. 




 oooh ooh ooh that's a party foul. I wish you hadn't pointed that out. this is amazing otherwise. 




 the high rev is absolutely beautiful but I can't decide if my love for it outweighs my disdain for loud idling.

 that god damn thing is already louder than my 500w amp

 he's been living in the desert under a rock, watching reruns of 90s sitcoms no doubt. 




 because his light was about to turn green so in my haste I didnt realize the diglet was blocking part of the camera 









 just stop. nobody wants you here.

 maybe he's in Australia so when it turns upside down its actually right side up? 




 frankly I'm not sure 




 but who will clean the cleaner of the cleaner? 




 dead like your social life 




 people on reddit will go ape shit for the 800th ok looking girl to put a chicken on her shoulder but when a guy like you decides to poke fun at how tired this lame fucking joke is, you get torn apart for being bald. today is the day I unsubscribe.

 You could have a separate LaFerrari for each day of the week with that kind of cash. Assuming Ferrari would allow it. 




 This is why I always poo before driving. Takes about 4 seconds off my sprint time and adds about 20mpgs. On your marks, get set, science. 




 You might like this [v12 Fiat 500](https://youtu.be/GH2uwjk3fqM). If you look at related videos you can find the build process. I couldn't help but chuckle at the popup spoiler.

 I love fish's dopey faces. None compare to a good ol fashioned lawnmower blenny though. 




 Thats only true if the car is completely submerged. I can't tell of the front window was open but if it was, the pressure would equalize and you'd be able to open the back door.

 I spotted a pretty rare Porsche the other day (Chicago) and some German guy was like oh yeah everyone's bringing those out now that its warming up. But now the tables have turned.

 I'd take my kids the fuck to school in that. I like it a lot. 




 I caught one disappearing around the corner in the garage I park in when I go to the city. Not sure if it was a 6 or an 8 but that thing sounds like a choir of snarling cat-angels. Almost brought tears to my eyes. 




 I'm a brofessor. I drink beers and pretend I know what im talking about

 I saw your post in r/new and thought I was going crazy for a minute

 reliable minotaur

My friend hired a minotaur without bothering to check its references first. Within a week, a burglar broke in and stole his adamantine tunic. Was a family heirloom too. Do your homework folks.

 Try an osteopath for musculoskeletal stuff. Their practice revolves around it.

 Not to mention those incomparable interiors ( o . o ) 




 Do you not realize that YOURE a shitty enthusiast? There is nothing wrong with driving a Camry or a corolla. They're sensibly priced and fairly reliable.  




 True that. My first car was a shitty 95 integra and my second was a pretty nice 2005 TL. The integra was a blast because I always felt like I could die at any minute. The TL was a bit boring in comparison. 




 Looks like its past someone's bedtime 




 Having a car that you think looks like crap is awesome. You can park anywhere you want, drive carefree, and leave it on the street without worrying about teenagers fucking with it. I miss my beat up 95 integra sometimes. 




 Constricted 




 How dare you post Stlenhag without personally alerting me. You knew he was my favorite. 




 If this car is legal then why are the boner police arresting me just for looking at it? 




 Yeah the blue squiggles one was weirdly satisfying. OP should title it "toothpaste thingies" 




 That goddamn sacrotuberous ligament 




 Also interesting: your fingers have no muscle in them. Flexors and extensors are all the way in the forearm and side-to-side-ers are in the hand. 




 Dissecting the hand and foot was a pain in the ass but not as big a pain in the ass as dissecting the ass.

 Um no sir that is a rabbit. Sir... 




 Its for defrosting the restless souls of the damned probably. Might as well just harvest them fresh though so they don't have that weird freezer taste. 




 Nah dude it was probably just Jimmy Fallon doing an impression of Bigfoot impersonating a bear. Classic Jimmy. 




 Slartibartfast has outdone himself this time. 




 Wait so dragons' veins aren't actually that color? 




 Tulips are too cold. 




 Oh yeah well my dog is an honors student.  Even brag about it on my bumper sticker 




 As if it didn't look awesome enough in photos. I was next to one yesterday in white and it is absolutely stunning in real life. 




 Its pronounced "MOOLtipass" 




 My old boxer used to creep into the room, grab a sock and sprint off into the sunset with it. One time she was running round with 2 dollars in her mouth and nobody knew where shed taken it from. 




 Feeding bells will ring

And we'll give him some krill-ahh 




 I've been to reefs in 5 different countries and spent a week in a compound in Belize surveying one. And if I wasn't going into medicine I might have done marine biology. As for captive raising, eels are sedentary and the only reason they will even leave their burrow is to hunt so if the eel is placed in a tank with sufficient burrowing space and fed properly then it is irrelevant whether the burrow is in a tank or in the ocean or on the moon because it will not leave. I'm going to quit arguing here though because I know you're just going to keep nitpicking. 




 Please don't tell my dad. I don't want to get the belt again 




 I can't tell if you're trolling but he was captive bred and moved to a 500 gallon tank when he got too big. Keeping a saltwater aquarium isn't like keeping a hamster. It costs easily thousands and is an enormous time commitment and the people who are dedicated enough to get into it have actually contributed hugely to our understanding and awareness of coral reefs so maybe next time do your research before spouting bullshit about "horrible industry" and accusing people of not knowing what they are doing when you're the one who clearly has no idea what you're talking about. 




 Saw him at the pet store and told the guy "I need this" 




 I had a moray eel that I had to give up because he was way too big. He seemed thrilled with his new home which was 25 times bigger. I always wonder how he's doing since those guys live for like 40 years 




 It looks like one of those cheap airbrushings you get at like sea world. So cool on an actual animal though 




 I always wish I didn't have a warranty do that I could do stuff to it without feeling bad but then I remember I'm broke. 




 I've never seen a street car that could make army green look good until I saw a c7 do it. Its like blake lively. You could throw a clown suit on it and it'd still make my heart flutter. 




 They are messy as hell and lose their minds if the tank is too small. I'd have 1 in there tops 




 When you think a 2015 stingray is ugly your opinion is wrong. 




 You should read "Footsteps" by /u/1000Vultures 




 I believe I've found my calling 




 I'm glad to hear that. I personally groaned at my own joke ;) 




 You ain't no snowflake, pal. 




 I love the guys laugh at the end too. AHH HAH. OH HAH. HUH. UHHUH. HAH. WOHHHAH. WOO! 




 you sound le rad 




 Easier and more environmentally friendly to just harvest my beer and Mexican food shits and use that instead 




 Do you mean Jon snuhh? 




 You betta put a lid in there so it doesn't happen again

 (    ) 




 ^ literally this 




 you literally just read my mind. 




 Squirrel cat? 




 DAE le girlfriend? 




 More specifically, an amphipod eating all the crap in your tank is good because it prevents bacteria from getting at it and turning it into ammonia. Anything that slows down the decay process is good. 




 The water looks very cloudy. Either your filter is too high above the tank and its producing too many microbubbles or your phosphates or nitrates are off. The odds of a hitchhiker killing fish are almost 0 unless you get very unlucky and have tiny fish. 




 You're uh... You're beautiful... 




 Can you see Texas from your high horse? 




 I think the term you're looking for is "trashy" 




 I've tried this. The police tend not to believe it. 




 By my mother's mandible, I WILL WALK IT OFF 




 I'm just tall enough that if I crank my seat as high as it goes I can lean my arm out. I agree though its a poor trend. 




 I tried to wet fold a rabbit. That shit was hard man if you use too little water it crinkles and of you use took much it just kind of melts 




 Quality control? If you outsource something as important as the motor and your manufacture starts cutting corners, especially with cutting edge tech like this, you're going to fuck yourself over. If one car catches fire you will never hear the end of it. 




 Even YOU could be a buttplug! 




 I can physically hear that music in my head 




 *sighhh*. I GUESS I'll settle for a diablo. 




 So cool! I love how blobby they are.

 I don't like this new squinty look. Its OK for the dart but on a muscle car *cough* charger *cough* I really do not like it at all :( 




 Its a superveloce AND its Illini colors? This boner is going straight to the moon.

 Nah man she's just wearing a really small softball mitt 




 As someone who has spent 24 years and counting in order to become a proper physician, this shit makes me physically ill.

 Then how did we get the video huh? How? HOW? 




 Lickitung sushi game was the best

 Self contained, infinitely powered  platforms capable of stable hover even with the added weight of a person or anthropomorphized man-sized animal? Let's build a bunch of them and have them pointlessly go up and down in the middle of nowhere.

 REPOOOO- oh he credited the artist. We need more people like you. 




 Looks a bit like one in the thumbnail but there's no mistaking those feline headlights 




 I tried and couldn't do it. They added all this annoying shit in HotS that makes it way too hard if you're as terrible as I am at micro :p 




 I mean it IS a genetic mutation but there's no evidence to support it being inhumane. I'm curious why they call them lionheads actually 




 Definitely Oscar 




 Student doctor here. Rainbow poops? Diagnosis: unicorn. 




 Fuck all of you. I like the panamera 




 Something looks off about it. Like its a kit 




 Two clutches in 4.5 years? You must have been driving it right!

 Diagnosis: highschooler 




 I like how they throw "army veteran" in there to pander for your sympathy right from the start. Bad form. 




 He probably just chilled all night and some diatoms or something grew there and then when the lights came on he moved and they came off 




 Meme hard or meme home I always say 




 Semirelated but that insufferable douchebag in the YouTube ads telling me that he has a Lamborghini but he prefers his books... Every time they made me sit through that I'd just close the window and not even watch the video. 




 That accent too 




 Making a good old fashioned stick even harder to find :( 




 Not true Im 6 foot 185 and I eat fast food almost every day. In the past 2 days I went to McDonald's and Panera twice and chic Fil a once. It's the 2 hour gym sessions that do it. 




 A narruh hyurethra? 




 So can tuggin at the ol' weiner 




 Or the blackness of the void mine left behind (_) 




 Its understandable. He needed the extra money to build his hideous superyacht. 




 Even if it worked wouldn't you just end up with reverse coffee? Why not just make tea 




 Gr8 alliter8ion m8 I r8 it 8/8 




 Someone explain to me how this is possible. They are so shiny and perfect. 




 Ask them questions about filter feeding. A skate punching wouldn't know how to answer. 




 Oh yeah well... the jerk store called. They ran out of YOU. 




 This is like a lame pun thread in post form 




 A clam cupping a human boob is like a human cupping a clam boob. Do you want to cup a clam boob for the rest of your life? Well? DO YOU? 




 Thanks man. Good luck in undergrad. Don't get anyone pregnant 




 So what you're saying is we need to invent rechargeable cheez its and power our drones with those. 




 Worse, med school. I'm like you but even poorer and more sleep deprived. 




 I can be powered for an entire day on nothing but cheez its. You'd think a tiny drone could last more than 20 min 




 So true. A guy once posted 2 clowns in a pico on here and was found murdered the next day. True story. 




 I like when people with names like BootyFista say intelligent things. 




 I want an awd 70s trans am with liften suspension and off road tires personally. Smoke grey with white racing stripes and red leather interior

 Ahhhhh I just figured out why all of my pictures come out pitch black. You are a godsend. 




 I thought it was a theater art piece 




 Red marble was still a little hungover from the night before. Poor form. He deserved the loss. 




 I thought this was already the dubstep version 




 I honestly have no idea :p congrats though! 




 Motherload. Go buy some lotto tickets 




 I want 3D doritos back. 




 I have to disagree. I've owned a boxer and a boston who both "smile" when they're anxious as well as when they're happy. Really any sense of heightened emotion results in their lips pulling back.
