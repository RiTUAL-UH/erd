 Is this true?  If yes, one of the most horrifying images I've ever seen. 




 I'll be interested in informed responses to this question, but I've read that Oscar Wilde could read two pages at a time, one with each eye.  




 Thank you for your comment and sincere apologies if I am incorrect.  

Please read the artist's statement: 
"With "Tears of Nanjing" I want to show my deepest sympathy and love for all those totally innocent people who were perished so unjustifiably and with outmost cruelty, but also I want to remind the Japanese leaders that as long as they do not want to face the history, humanity cannot and will not possibly forgive and forget". (Gene Emerson) 









 Pavel Lisitsian. 




 One of my favorite operas, Ariadne auf Naxos by Strauss!

 In fact, R-K's opera fueled the "Salieri poisoned Mozart" rumor, inspiring Shaffer's play. 




 Aloe gel, let it dry. Then try some coconut oil or olive oil and let it soak in. 




 The first performance of the 4 Last Songs occurred after Strauss' death.  He wrote these most beautiful songs with Kirsten Flagstad's voice in mind, and she premiered the songs with Furtwngler in 1952. Many critics consider their live collaboration to be the finest of all recorded performances of these songs.  Unfortunately, the sound quality is wretched, but one can hear the magnificent interpretation in spite of the poor sound.  
Thank you brocket66 for this post.  4 Last Songs are the ultimate, final flowering of the German Romantic tradition. 




 Abendempfindung by Mozart (try Schwarkopf).  Too many to count by Schubert, but try Gretchen am Spinnrade, Erlknig, An Sylvia, Die Taubenpost, Litanei aus dem Fest, Nacht und Trume, and so many more (he wrote over 600.) Many Russian romances by Tchaikovsky, including Amid the din of the ball, None but the lonely hearts, Why, The fires in the room were dying out.  Richard Strauss' Four last songs. 


































 His atavistic position on abortion, which should be a fundamental right for all women. Please allow me to remind you of the right's incessant attacks on women's bodies.  Yes, he's a 'libertarian' but his positions on women are extreme right. 




 I'm sorry, I don't understand your comment. 




 One year of mourning her father. 




 I'd have to search for the source (and can try if anyone is interested), but I recall that there is a tradition from Shakespeare and/or classical comedy, of having the characters group together in a happy ending.   




 Bernie over anyone.  Rand hates women. 









 He gives new meaning to the phrase 'cheesehead'.   




 Marital rape is still legal in India, and violence against women is horribly prevalent on a global level.  In Russia, before the revolution, it was common for the landowners (serf/slave owners) and the rich to sexually exploit serfs with no consequences.  Just read about Tchaikovsky's relationship with his servant. 
 
I would like to add that on reddit, in the comments, I observe so  much disrespect and violent thoughts directed at women that it is repulsive. 




 Not to mention appalling grammar and diction. 




 I've observed a fashion for Americans to intentionally americanize foreign names, saying it's "pretentious" to pronounce them appropriately.  How sad. 









 Great!  I was unaware of thorium's potential as an energy source.   
























 He's stupid, he's short, he's ugly.  He will not do well in primaries.  Americans don't like short and ugly although they tolerate stupid to a frightening degree.  Wisconsinites do seem to favor ignorant dropouts, though.  Rep. Reid Ribble is a bible school dropout and Walker just couldn't cut it in college.  These men have no education, no brains, and no morals. They are Koch brother whores.  









 Walker is the puppet of the Koch brothers who are using Wisconsin as the testing ground state for their world/nation destroying policies. 




 One of my favorite Mozart compositions.  Also love Pollini and Bhm in K.488. 




 Vier letzte Lieder - 4 Last Songs.  There are many great recordings:
Anneliese Rothenberger, Andr Previn https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n77jQCrjA6M
Martina Arroyo, Gnter Wand https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0epM71y1l8M
Olga Peretyatko, Dmitri Bliss https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QvFynvO7yc
 




 The live broadcasts of Tristan with Flagstad and Melchior at the Met, from 1935 to 1941, are the most brilliantly sung, imo.  Also immortal are the live Beecham and Reiner recordings from 1936 and 1937. 
 
There are some phenomenally sung/conducted Meistersingers from Knappertsbusch (3 available) and a studio recording from Kubelik with Sandor Konya's gorgeous, Italianate Walther and Gundala Janowitz's luminous Eva.  

The 1955 live stereo Ring from Keilberth at Bayreuth is first rate.  It was suppressed until recently because of preferential treatment of Solti's studio recording (with less excellent singing, imo).  I actually like the Keilberth 1953 Ring even better.  

There is a live Tannhuser from Leinsdorf with Melchior and Flagstad that is one of the greatest live opera recordings I've ever heard.

I prefer Golden Age Wagnerian singing/conducting. Many of these recordings are available on YouTube. 




 Ljuba Welitsch's Salome was unforgettable.  Here she is with Fritz Reiner and Hans Hotter, one of the greatest Wotans.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SJMlNDFS0Q
She recorded the final scene with Reiner in 1949 - hair raising: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BReBIkkExM 









 All the more reason to condemn him and call him out on his repressive, backward attitude. 




 Rand Paul is anti-abortion. Period.   




 It's called the lieto  fine, a tradition in opera buffa to conclude with a joyful ending. 




 Whatever he calls himself, his position on women's rights is wrong. 
























 Here is a playlist of truecrypt performing.  If you listen to some of these I think you would agree he is a tremendous and expressive pianist, well trained in the Russian school of piano performing, with his own beautiful, powerful sound.
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL65D7125C29FA7CDB 




 No, he's really a phenomenal artist who was trained in the Moscow Conservatory, I believe.  He was unable to have a performing career, probably because of unspeakable political difficulties, and I think he went into computer programming.  His Pictures at an Exhibition is superb! 




 Thank you so much!  The ensemble from Il filosofo reminds me a tiny bit of La Serva Padrona, which I love a lot.  The piano sonata is lovely, too.  The aria from Demofoonte resembles Mozart's Idomeneo a little.   




 When Tchaikovsky first performed his new piano concerto for his mentor/most famous pianist in Russia, Rubinstein, the latter hated it and ripped it to shreds, much to Tchaikovsky's great distress.  Later on Rubinstein became the champion of this work, performing it frequently. 




 Can you please recommend something gorgeous from one of these four composers - would love to hear. 









 Well, Mozart was only 14 in 1770.  His blockbuster hits were yet to come in spite of already having composed over 100 works (correct me if I'm wrong on this number.) 









 Scott Walker will go down in history as the ideologue destroyer of Wisconsin's economy, environment, educational system and public image.  He's the creator of the now backward Wisissippi and is the darling of the mentally arthritic old white men who rule (and vote in)  this state.  He's a disgrace to the legacy of Wisconsin.  As an arrogantly ignorant anti-intellectual, among his worst crimes may be the harm being done to the state's flagship school, the UW.  He'll never be the president because it will be too easy to out him as the Koch brother's idiot whore.  Even the American voting public won't tolerate a smarmy little liar like Scott Walker.   




 The last movement is really exciting. Thanks. 




 Daphne, his final opera, possessed him at the end of his life.  It fulfilled his inclination to classical scholarship.  It's very gorgeous and this is a brilliant recording of it with Fritz Wunderlich and Hilde Gden.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-i4XWlC_Qc4 




 You're right. I forgot that. Thanks. 
























 That belongs with Scott Walker's claim that since he handled the teacher protests at the Capitol he could handle ISIS.  The lowest common denominator mentality. 




 Thanks, Scott.   









 No, it's not mine.  Sorry.   














 Thanks again very much for these recommendations.  These works are completely unknown to me.  It's reassuring to know I'll never run out of operas to listen to.  

Mozart's La clemenza di Tito is beautiful - especially the Act l buffa finale, which he engineered into one of his great scenes. 
 




 I don't think Walker has a chance at the nomination.  He's too stupid, vapid, ugly and undignified for national popularity at any meaningful level.  Not presidential material.  He does share a similar expression with W (that 'duh' look indicating profound stupidity) but he doesn't have W's wealthy upbringing to lend the illusion of class to his image.  









 Thanks very much for this link.  Yes, that's Truecrypt.  Here's what he said about his educational background:

"I have quite typical Soviet/Russian musical background, but I was lucky to study in Moscow in early 70s -
- definitely the best place to be a piano student at that time.

Let me just mention some of the teachers: Lev Oborin, Yakov Flier, Yakov Zak, Yakov Milstein, Lev Naumov, Boris Zemlyansky, Dmitri Bashkirov, Eliso Virsaladze, Stanislav Neuhaus, Tatiana Nikolayeva

Not to mention great teachers at the Gnesin Institute  Alexander Ioheles, Maria Yudina, Maria Grinberg, Naum Starkman, Oleg Boshniakovich

Hope you can imagine the atmosphere! All these great musicians were completely accessible, i.e. their lessons were open to public.

The list of students wasnt too shabby either: Egorov, Pletnev, Pogorelich, Gavrilov, Igolinsky, Demidenko, Dang Thai Son, Postnikova, Shebanova and many more So, it was a pretty good background!" 




 The Soviet Union was a difficult place to make a career in music, to say the least.  It was a totalitarian state. 

Read Maya Plisetskaya's or Galina Vishnevskaya's memoirs for some insight into the dangers and unbelievable obstacles artists endured in the soviet era. 

I know some of these details from reading his comments and from a few brief exchanges with him.  He's so modest for such a talented and skilled artist.  The training was exceptional at the soviet conservatories. 




 I'll look forward to your post.  I am madly in love with Mozart, especially his operas, and would like to be more familiar with the musical context in which he matured.  Of Hasse, I only know his comment about young Mozart: "This boy will consign us to oblivion" or something like that.

Thanks very much for the recommendations.  I'll definitely check out the Pergolesi.  There was a beautiful old film made of La Serva Padrona with stunning Anna Moffo.  I saw it in chunks on YouTube, but it was missing the delightful finale. 





























 Walker continues to dig his own grave with his stupidity and delusions.  He will be completely vulnerable to public shaming and criticism if/when opponents go after him.  He will sink like a rock in a debate with just about anyone, even fellow idiot Rick Perry.  I'd like to see him go at it with Santorum just for the fun of it. 




 Sickening. 




 As if we needed more evidence about how delusional he is. 




 A tragedy for everyone. 




 He thinks he is, but actually he's on a mission from the Koch brothers. 




 No, it's religion interfering with the government that is the problem.  Women's reproductive rights and the war on women's bodies are a perfect example.
 




 At Burger King. 




 Slavery rhetoric? Does Rand Paul think people will believe his ridiculous argument? He reveals what an evil, greedy pig he is and that as a doctor he's motivated by money alone.  The white male ruling class at its ugliest. Medical bills are the leading cause of bankruptcy.  Americans themselves are slaves to the Medical-Insurance-Pharmaceutical Industrial Complex which addicts them to drugs and pigeon holes them into narrow diagnostic categories/treatment determined by insurance companies and medical bureaucracies.   









 Scott Walker and Joseph McCarthy - Wisconsin's most shameful politicians.   




 Her memoirs are brilliant.  I've read them several times.  It's terrible that the Soviets destroyed most of her work and erased any references to her - she was basically eliminated.  I was so happy to discover this recital.  There is another one from a few years later, in the Tchaikovsky Museum in Klin, where she's even more beautiful and impressive.
