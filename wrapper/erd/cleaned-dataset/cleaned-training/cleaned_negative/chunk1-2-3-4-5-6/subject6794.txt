 Well..... welcome to reddit i guess. 









 Zoids. It was a really underrated show on cartoon network and a lot of people I know have never even heard of it. Probably because it was on at like 5:30 in the morning. Maybe it could get some sort of following after being on Netflix.  
























 The same goes with video games? Do you play them in chronological order or when they were made? Example:Kingdom Hearts or Metroid?

If you miss your turn or your entrance to the grocery store, you have to go up two more blocks, turn left, get on the highway, merge to a different Highway, take the exit, and left turn, just to get to the turn that was 3 feet behind you. Not to mention... It's all uphill

 I remember Create-a-review. That's was the place for the community! I remember hanging out with the Tho guys. Tek was really cool.
