 But I love the Bucks...  Idk why but they are my East coast team.  They play with amazing style.  I have made alot betting on them because the critics give the spread so high against the Bucks...  Have pride in your team because I give you 2 years to be a contender.  





























 I like things like free grand slams on your bday at Dennys... What are some other tricks we should know?  Redbox promo codes, free food,  etc?

 What exactly are numbers?  My professor and I were in discussion about them and he implied that numbers are entities separate from physics,  math,  and science.  We *use* them and apply them but math in itself doesn't imply truth...  Have you heard this and can someone explain his logic?

 Serious question. I want to know if someone passes away in law enforcement, it looks like everyone that's a  cop attends.  Who is patrolling or working? Wouldn't this be the time to do a crime?  









 I have thought for the last couple years that Westbrook deserves his own team like the Celtics and then build around him. I just don't like how Westbrook is a 2nd option. Do you think that he should have him own team?  




 Hope you enjoyed this as much as I enjoyed losing to this.  kt is incredible.  




 I pointed this out a few weeks ago.  ruby just collected his 7th technical of the season.  For a guy with a usually quiet demeanor,  this has been a big sign of him changing.  What do you think has happened?  We can't afford both our stars collecting 20+ techs a season. Ruby never got techs like this before this season.  
























 IMO Jason Thompson gets a lot of crap as a starting PF.  He has been a staple on our defense and has improved throughout the years.  He has been the longest standing King on the team and is amazing in the community. Relatively humble and hasn't had attitude problems. 

There is not one person on the that we have tried to replace more then him.  He has outplayed numerous candidates like T-rob,  Landry,  Patterson, Evans and Acy. Always been a fan but I believe he deserves more credit.   









 Literally that.

 Growing up I had a family of 5 including myself.  My mother and father were divorced and very bitter people.  My mother was a Irish Catholic who drank often and suffered from emotional issues.  My father was a military Protestant who was semi abusive.  I was very rebellious growing up but fairly intelligent.  I read frequently and often pondered about philosophy and science. I was not forced into church except Easter of course for the grandma.  I was involved with partying and fighting in high school while being involved with the wrong crowd.  I eventually met a girl who introduced me to a christian church. I loved the fellowship and was engulfed with positive emotion.  I eventually did mission trips and became proactive in the church. My relationship with this girl seized and I focused on Jesus.  I eventually met a girl who I just loved.  Only issue was she was very immersed deep into the ranks at the church.  We started dating and this caused a mini uproar.  I was reprimanded, chastised,  tormented and disrespected by church officials for this relationship. Hypocrisy oozed out faster than I could have imagined.  Eventually I left my position as a youth group leader,  Bible study leader and Sunday school teacher because of this. I turned my back on religion because I realized that religion is made by people for people.  Dogma is just that... dogma. I eventually went back to reading my philosophy.  Nietzsche, Kafka,  Kant,  Schopenhauer and Hume all played a huge impact on my life.  I studied life as I am now finishing my BA in Philosophy.  My focus is religious studies. I was still left with a void until about a year ago I discovered Buddhism. I study and practice meditation,  Buddhism and Taoism.  I study the lifestyle...  Not the religion.  I believe that each person's life is for them to explore.  I realized Christianity is a very corrupt religion when it comes to their church but has taught me numerous things.  I believe one should explore all facets of their lives. This journey isn't over for me but just beginning.  









 I wanted to share with you guys that I had the best Meditation session to date.  Not that I am grading them or one better than the other, this one was just very different.  I was sitting there in breathe for a few minutes when I began doing some chants as usual.  Maybe it was just one of those busy weeks but everything seemed to slow down.  I was very aware of my surroundings and very focused.  I returned to breathe easily and felt very content.  Sorry just wanted to share with you guys.  




 I was driving on a very busy freeway when I saw the usual crazy motorcyclist weaving through traffic. I then thought how efficient it would be to have a motorcycle lane. A small lane like the bike lane to the right of the fast lane. Prevent deaths, injuries, and vehicle damage. More people would be inclined to take advantage of this safe benefit and now we have a green solution to car emission and less money on gas.  














 Why?

 Please... I beg you guys to stop whining about the FO. It hasnt even been a month without Malone.. Shit happens and we move on. OUR OWNERSHIP GAVE YOU A TEAM!!! Why are we questioning them so soon? You all thought a 6-1 start was our championship debut and you are expecting Corbin to jump right in and take us to the championship?

Same people wanting Malone back were crying about his rotations earlier. Have faith please and enjoy. This is the calming before the storm. 









 We were 6-1 leading the league in RPG. Our plays have (I am assuming) the same ones Ty Corbin has been running with Malone since he got here. We have lost our fire and the team is off rhythm... sobbing up and down the floor and losing within winning margins by losing teams. Our TO are HORRIBLE!!

Why get rid of Malone? When we were winning...? Makes no sense unless you wanted to lose perhaps?

Falling bottom ten secures our 1st round pick (which we dont have for a few years), allows newbies developmental time (as we have seen with Nik and Ray. We got Rudy to sign and now we blame Corbin for our failure.. We polish up next year with George Karl. Otherwise I can't make sense of this...

Edit: I ask because I am at my SO house and her family are all really huge hunters. I have nothing against guns but we were watching hunting shows and they were shooting bucks... they went into the Bucks home and baited them in the illusion of mating and in turn shot them with a bow.

I ran into a gentleman awhile back who dressed like a Tibetan Monk trying to sell me prayer beads... I realized he was a Hare Krishna follower... what exactly is that? What is the difference between them and Buddhists? 




 I was pretty amazed at the Bucks history of 3-Point shooters. Michael Redd, J.J. Reddick and Ray Allen. Am I missing any? Why do they develop such good shooters?

 This actually happened last year and I can't forget it. I was driving my car to get some food when I hit a stop sign right by the place I wanted to eat. Crossing the street was a man in his mid 20s. He was moving rather slow but he was already to far in front of my car for me to beat him. As he got in front of my car,  he stopped and started looking around slightly but has his head down like he was looking for something. I was patient for about a minute when I came to the conclusion that he must be messing with me. Wrong conclusion.  I decided to honk my horn which startled the man terribly.  The look on his face is burned into my memory.  It was at this moment I realized that this man was mentally handicapped. He was absolutely terrified and ran away!  I felt horrible. I feel horrible.  To this day I remember this story anytime I get frustrated on the road. 


Be patient on the road. It's not worth hurting yourself or others.

 So I was with this girl for about 2 1/2 years.  Hot girl and really good natured.  VERY TRUSTWORTHY.  I was the flirt.  I was this I was that.  She was just a church girl.  University comes along and girl starts acting different.  I notice she was socializing with some of her coworkers. Told her I wasn't comfortable with it and she said I was over-reacting. I decided 30 different girls is better than 1 girl who is going to play you.  I broke it off, played around and landed a smoking hot girl. 

As for her?  She has been seeing the guy she was "talking"  to for a little while now. Make the right choice.  Not the beta choice.  No pussy is worth losing your cool over...  Ever.  




 So my Gf and I decided to take a spring break trip to go hiking in California about 2 hrs from where I live. We carefully plan the trip as we will leave at 10ish and be there about 12. 
 
So we are driving up to the forest when she tells she wants to check out this small town she used to go to. (check out trinkets and such I guess idk...) I agree and I Google map it.  About 40 min away..  But then I see a couple small roads that look like they cut angles and time off.  And obviously Google maps has no idea WTF it's talking about Ima do *my* shortcut.  Well...  It took us 20 min in and was a dead end... Drive back and go original way.  Gf rolls her eyes pretty hard. 

We leave her trinket town and leave to the forest.  Once again we map it and I see another "brilliant" short cut. She does her half assed attempt to convince me other wise but I was sure it was better. We ended up lost for and hour and a half to only end up 25 min from where we took my shortcut. We proceed with the original plan.. 

The last one was while in the forest. We were a good hour into the trail when we deviated off the trail to see some site seeing. Well to get back we decided to go a different way then our original...  It is a loop.  Wrong...  We ended up wasting and hour and a ton of energy/sunlight. We went the original way and just arrived home.  She is pretty pissed off and asked if she can keep her jewelry where I am supposed to keep my brain... 

TL;DR Went on hike.  Got lost driving.  Got lost again.  Got lost during hike.  Gf thinks I'm an idiot.  I think I'm an idiot. 

On mobile. Sorry.

  Well this is unfortunate to say the least.. It all happened when my mom asked me if I could take her necklace to the jewelers to have it cleaned. First of all,  I didn't know you could clean gold so I laughed.  She explained that they do and how important her necklace is. I guess my father bought it for her years ago before he passed away.  It was a gold necklace with a beautiful gem in the front.  
She wore it a lot and explained it needed some TLC. Fast forward to the drive to the jewelry shop. I decided to stop for some food.  Got my McDonald's and threw the trash in the bag and threw the bag away.  I arrive at the store and that's when I realize I can't find the necklace.  I search everywhere in the car but I can't find it. It occurs to me that it may have fallen into the McDonald's bag when I threw it away.  I drive back to the McDonald's to find the bag right next to the trash bin. Empty.  I lost my mom's necklace that she loved dearly...  I can't see her heart break again or it will destroy me.. So I have decided to make her a new necklace just like the last one.  I have the mold for the necklace and even the gem...  NOW ALL I NEEDS IS SOME GOLD!?!?!

 I am a Kings fan and we are in talks of possibly acquiring Goran.. This upsets me especially with how he is handling your team.  He is upset his brother isn't getting minutes? Upset they signed Thomas? Wants a max deal?  All of this is absurd for a good (not great) player...  


They only got Thomas as insurance and 6th man potential but sounds like he took that personally.  Now your team is going to piss off Thomas by trying to shovel him off in delusional hopes of keeping Dragic... I say trade him and focus on the future.  Good luck.

 Fact...  I spoke to God about this.  




 Hopefully...  That's be awesome.  




 Getting rid of the dead K St mall will also breathe life into newer retail to position around that area. Restaraunts and hopefully night life.  I just worry about natomas falling  away. 


We also can't forget that we are building a soccer stadium for a team who may potential be picked up by the MLS... Big things people 




 Let's think...  We are putting a multi million dollar arena in the heart of downtown. We have huge hotel brands bidding on putting hotels near the arena and already have talks of improving the skyline.  I project the Kings to start being a contender in a short amount of time. This is a good time for sacramento to try and make huge strides. 


The drought hurts us alot but I honestly feel that in ten years,  downtown will be unrecognizable to an extent.

From my knowledge of transfers and what counselors have told me, you can change your major as long as you meet the requirements for that said major it shouldn't be an issue.  If the major is impacted or requires certain criteria such as GPA approvals and such per major,  then those must be met as well as deadlines if there are some. 


As far as I have heard,  TAGs cannot change.  That may be wrong but that is what I heard.  Hope this helps.  Call your advisor or the counseling office at the University.

 Knife attack in Israel isn't top priority on terrorists attacks...  Shit I think that is one of the only ones they could pull off.  Israel has been putting up with this shit for years...  ISIS is no different. The counter terrorist group is Israel is one of the best in the world. ISIS has picked on countries who are in shatters due to war... Jordan or Israel would murder ISIS. The bully never picks on the one that fights back.   




 /r/circlejerk  




 Because Israel is actually strong as fuck...  ISIS would be destroyed.  I'm not disagreeing with foreign support I just don't believe that is the reason why they aren't attack Israel.  Truth is they wouldn't stand a chance.

 Hello gents! I am in the market for a pitchfork that is capable of destroying a mob/riot while still can start one if need be.  Does not need to be automatic but I would like a built in body cam on the handle in case of an altercation.  I also heard that the rioters in Baltimore are virtually undetectable at night so thermoscope or built in light is a must!  Help me out guys!!!  Paying big money!

 So my SO and I went on a day trip to take pictures with her new camera. We traveled down to the river where she was taking pictures carelessly as we walked down to the river. At the river, there is a bridge that overlooks the river with some nice vantage points. She resumes her photo session of taking pictures of the scenery when after a short while we decided to call it quits. We begin the hike up back to the car when she decides to look at her photographs. in one of the photographs, we see a man in the picture and we start joking about who this man was. We decided to zoom in on the picture and lo behold.... [I am pretty sure this man was exposing himself while eerily looking at us!](http://i.imgur.com/YmKbNGx.jpg) I am not sure but I am pretty confident that this is what is going on in the picture! Extremely disheartening for someones first photo shoot!

TL;DR Went to the river with Gf to take pictures... ended up accidently catching an old mans pork and beans. 







































 I played all fucking 82 games in my player...  Went to the playoffs and accidently press play key game.  Fucking Kings go down 3-0 Vs elimination for first round. I had 52 pts, 10 asts, and close to 6 stls. We are down by one and I get the ball with 5 seconds left and try to call timeout...  But I hit the Xbox button...  GAME over.  I Chris Webber choked playoff style.

 What was courageous about what seems like a publicity stunt by the most publicity hungry family in history. Courage isn't seeking public affirmation...  Courage is doing what you feel is right for you no matter the consequence. This whole thing disturbs me. 


Prep the down votes.  









 This is a genuine question  




 Ok.  




 /r/oddlysatisfying 




 wat?  









 Why ugh  




 It's so fucking difficult with this restraining order to have a good conversation.

 Not referring to my post..... But thanks bud 




 Repost but always nice to see.  




 KWhy do people fucking down vote this 




 C'mon...  I definitely have haha

 Wow!  Didn't know about this one.  It's $45 for general admission lol [definitely going to it](http://hardrockcasinolaketahoe.com/entertainment-events/3rd-annual-lake-tahoe-reggae-festival/)  




 I'm going but I think it's august..  If your are talking about dirty heads and slightly stoopid. 














 I went to cali roots and tribal seeds put on an amazing show. Naoko had the best performance.  Jboog is always good and Josh Heinrich rarely tours.  It'll be worth it for sure.  




 I'd assume just Google the name 




 Bet you're a hoot at parties...  




 Yea man Josh Heinrich doesn't come around alot.  I'm pretty stoked 




 It is called [dry diggings festival](http://drydiggingsfestival.com/) and it's in Placerville.  


Quality bands that resemble a day like Cali Roots. If you love reggae,  than you should be proud of sacramento for this.

 Why do you post this shit here...

 I'm not trying to sound ignorant, foolish or rude by this.  I just can't understand why baseball has such an enormous following.  It takes so long and rarely is there action and when there is it is very short. This time of year is coming close to one of my least favorite times when other sports end and baseball is left.  Why do you enjoy it so maybe I can see something I'm missing.  




 Reddit formula...  See a post with good reception.  Take the idea and add a stupid twist for karma..    




 Yea man sorry to hear that.  I would consider talking to an admissions counselor and finding out the appeal process...  May be an up Hill battle

Unfortunately yes...  They will rescind your admission.  There are appeal processes so good luck but it's time to find a 2nd option... 


My question...  How the fuck did you fail theatre?  




 I recommend a bathroom

 Because man do I fucking hate Terry...  




 I was driving with my SO today when I saw a Clarks pest control car. I decided that it would be funny to yell "Clark we need you"  which is their slogan...  Well I yelled it.. 

The guys expression which reeked of FML just glared at me.  Not an ounce of amusement..   He then looked genuinely sad which honestly made me sad. Now I look like a fucking ass hole for trying to be funny.. 

Tl;Dr I needed Clark but he didn't care..  









 Thib would be an upgrade to alot of teams....  




 I have?  




 That was my 2nd one

 I was watching the news today when I saw a story of a girl about 19 years old. The news program kept explaining that a *Woman* did this and a *woman* did that.... 


But I kept saying to myself that she is just a girl...  A kid.  I'm 23 and I'm still just a kid. Then I fucked up... 


I am a man...  Not a kid anymore.  It is a sad day today.  Beer is to be consumed...

 Patriot bikes is on Madison and San Juan. Another inexpensive place is performance bikes on Sunrise and Madison.  




 Is there a reason it is prolonged?  




 I was at patriot bikes the other day and they had nice single speeds for around your budget.  They can order the bike and may take a few days to assemble but would be a good place to start.  


Working in the bike industry,  I'd say that 300 is gonna be a tough time but good luck to you. Are long boards out of the picture?

 It happens alot 




 BORNS is sick.  It's actually only him.  




 Good job!  




 I almost edited my response.  I think that's what took from the album.  The classic commercializing of the band happened.  They made the sex appeal the lead and raggi sits back when he was just as important.  Watch the hood morning America video that someone posted...  He just looks different. It's sad.  




 That motherfucker 




 This guy teaches us how to cut wood...  Now he teaches us to cut onions! 




 He turned into a lion at the end...  




 That three was it for me...  Dova can fuck my girl  




 Yea im seeing them at city of trees festival.  




 Crystals - mainstream hit. Pleasant yet different. 

Human -  nice lyrics and a little upbeat. 

Hunger -  Same as human.  Definitely a little more of a tune. 

Wolves with teeth -  Honestly I feel this is my favorite song.  A nice different vibe.  Good song to throw off the vibe of the other songs. 

Empire -  great lyrics and nice upbeat tune. 

Slow Life -  I feel most are gonna let this slip through the cracks.  It honestly is a gem of a song.  A little slower but lyrically great

Organs -  probably the next hit.  Lyrically sublime where I feel instrumentality,  the band reached the deepest.  Integration of the cello was just a treat. 

Black water -  kinda takes me back to MHIAA. 

Thousand Eyes -  Slow start up but a great entry into eye of the storm.  Cool drum sequence that actually is pretty intense. 

I of the storm -  My favorite single.  This song is lyrically deep and actually quite similar IMO to crystals. Awesome song. 

We sink - One of the more fun songs on the album. 

In all the album is everything I anticipated.  I saw them Saturday so that made this all the more worth it. I feel like they artistically didn't venture out like I wished but lyrically I feel it was deeper.  The songs are quote repetitive in sound but each demands it's own identity. Another great album by an amazing band.  




 Introduce a little anarchy 




 Dude this bitch is fucking ugly 




 Open some pussy.  Fuck your cake day 




  Fuck your cake day 




 I really honestly love every song.  Wolves without teeth is fun!  Slow life is just as good as any. Thousand eyes is intense and is an amazing build up. Organs is sick as any hit.  Same with humans. 

Only issue is that lot of songs sound repetitive. But that's like being fed cake over and over again. Kind of a good problem to have!  My favorite right now is probably wolves.  




 Fuck your cake day.

For whatever reason,  I think she is so ridiculously cute.  Her voice and accent just make her adorable.  




 I don't understand what's bad about this video... 

-Both women will be arrested and will better society by being gone.  

-The kid will hopefully be put in a better home and given a chance to succeed. 

-Two less people in line at Walmart.  BONUS: One less fat lazy person stealing a scooter from an elderly person

-visual entertainment during a boring Monday. 

These rednecks should be given an award IMO.

 I would definitely give admissions a call.  Reddit is not the only source of info.  I would call and find out.  Good luck!  I would put my money on that we will see you in the fall.  




 You must have accepted SIR before due date..  Idk who was advising you in your colleges but I accepted on SIR and eventually rescinded once I chose UCSC.  There is no consequence for accepting SIR and then deciding otherwise other than SIR fee. 

Even if you did accept SIR,  you will not meet their requirements either as all UC and CSU require good standings with institution and [C minimum in all classes attended in spring 2015.](http://admissions.ucsc.edu/apply/conditions-faq.html)  




 I would definitely begin CC application as a precaution. Contract states no D's but you may be able to try and appeal.  Good luck.  




 Idk why these keep getting posted..  Just search for the same question. 


You were already admitted.  They gave you a contract that states as long as you don't get/do "X"  you will be attending in the fall. Your GPA already got you in.  Unless it states anywhere in your contract of a GPA requirement (which to my knowledge it doesnt)  you are fine.

Contract states that you must attain at least C's on your final classes. Sounds like you did that.  




 Khan has a glass chin and is only been used for money purposes for the British population.  Any person who says either stands a chance is foolish.  I'd rather get my bang for my buck and have a HOF fighter who gave him his best run fight rather than a guy who just has popular support.

 Lol no...  I have been asking for it for months now on this sub.  Cotto was Mayweather toughest opponent and I don't wanna see Khan...  









 I am not trying to be a troll...  But do you guys remember Mayweather Vs Ortiz 24/7?

This guy is super emotional and I feel mentally unstable.  Nobody considers him relevant.  All he is is a roadblock to bigger fights.  I honestly felt that him and DE LA Hoya had a fling or something. They were just odd together and this doesn't stretch that.  They could have both been coked out since de la hoya went to rehab. 


This is all speculation and opinion.  




 What?  I'm sure they just gave him some craft bud til he was floating on air.  




 Even for a superstar,  those are some extreme minutes.  Do you think Lebron is going to fatigue?  









 Fuck off 




 The irony is ridiculous.  




 Stop crying,  they took off an upvote.  




 Sounds like they may be making teams potentially waste a pick so lower teams can possibly get someone better.  Good strategy.   




 Eventually I got in and it said it wasn't available yet...  This was like a few months ago

 I have been to three festivals this year...  I just got back from walk off the earth 2 days ago.... OMAM were the best concert and performance I have been to.  Nanna has an incredible voice....  They have single handedly deemed themselves the best band I can see in person.  Please see them in person.  




 DON'T TELL PEOPLES WTF BERNICE NEEDS!  




 I'm not saying it is...  Merely stating that it kinda reminds me of it.. I'm speaking of right now in Sacramento.  




 This cracked me up ha 




 I'm not tryna be rude but why was it Unattended...  That sounds like a lot was put into it

 Comcast will give *us* $5 for multiple outages but still over charge us in the monopoly hole they created!?  Ima buy 5 cheeseburgers!  




 Why is this here? Print this out and put it on Watt Ave... I hope none of us will ever need this.  




 OMAM is my favorite band.  I love MHIAA more than I can explain...  Nanna is gorgeous and their style was slick.  I heard crystals and thought WTF...  They sold out.  I was pissed off. Listened to it a few times and it grew on me. As did every single they put out (except I of the storm.  I loved that immediatly) They are growing and they changed. For the better.  Nanna and Raggie said this was a chance to open up.  *this* is the real OMAM.  I love it. Keep listening and you will too.  




 This band really sets the bar high for artists...  Their show was incredible. They made the audience be involved which was sick.  The bands chemistry is incredible. They all rotated to the front and lead at least once. Played every song you wanted to hear and even played the whole band on one guitar deal.  It was sick.  I've been to a ton of festivals including cali roots a few weeks ago...  This had been the best concert yet. Go if you haven't..!  




 I blame it on th e shitty tswift  




 I'm so excited for this album 




 Sick!  I see them Saturday at BFD 









 This!  Please for the love of all that is godly...  Notify Obama

 Girls -  slow magic 




 "Stop Mr. Jones!!!!", I screamed.  It was all to real.  I couldn't believe that it happened again.  My stuffed bear was touching my penis again. Mr. Jones was a beige colored stuffed bear with a missing button eye. Oh how he was a friend of mine.  We used to do everything together.  Fish,  hike,  sleep.  Man we were inseparable.  Then as we got older,  Mr. Jones became to close.  He would whisper obscenities in my ear as I slept like "Leonardo will never get an Oscar." or "Just do it!  Yesterday you say tomorrow,  so just.....  DO IT!". One time I woke up and I saw Mr.  Jones playing with himself watching me as I slept.  Sure I was wearing some nice,  comfortable, elastic less,  tag-less Hanes underwear with a logo of Space Jam on it. Mr.  Jones whispered under his breath.... "what's up doc". Mr. Jones copulated with me that night. As he pulled down my Hanes underwear that you can find at any target store for about $7.99 for a pack of 3, I realized that I had the slightest erection. It wasn't extremely high like you get when wearing a pair of Jordan high top sneakers, which you can find for appx. $100 at your local shoe store. No,  this erection let me know that I was ready to jam my piece into Mr. Jones. I slept that night. I awoke a new man.  Rejuvenated!  Alive!  Revived like a man who was worn down but had a fresh glass of Gatorade, which is a high performance energy drink engineered to allow you to perform at you peak ability which you can buy at any store for $3.00. I felt like I was set to explode! Like the Charlotte Bobcats will once we establish a firm grip on our front office direction,  which tickets can be purchased at www.nba.com/bobcats. Ticket prices may vary.  So come see us!!!"

 Yea but it's time to add some zest into our cowbell hate...  Denver seems just like the perfect city to hate.  




 You have our ex coach and ex GM...  You have swirled around in trade rumors consistently and are virtually a comparable team to the Kings and the Lakers are to shitty to hate...  So there ya go 




 Yea...  [about that](http://www.reddit.com/r/denvernuggets/comments/3aciqm/what_is_up_with_the_negativity_of_this_sub/).... 

r/kings is actually a super friendly and inviting sub.  But when you post stuff regarding a star player with no credible source either for karma *or* out of bad choice...  That's when they have come out.  We haven't been abrasive and we are open to all opinionated questions...  Shit I post multiple bad posts a month and still get treated well here.  It's how you may be coming across especially as a moderator or r/denvernuggets and judging another sub.  




 Cousins upside is huge as a scoring center.  I am overjoyed to have him for 3 years.  His attitude improved under Malone so I'm convinced he will be better again.  His contract is good for being arguably the best center in the league.  Many years looking forward boogie.  




 Fuck r/nba who down vote anybody who isn't general opinion.  You guys are Pao/Hitler.  




 Yea but that's not unwritten rules of reddit.  Unwritten rules are down vote if they don't agree..  




 Why is that?  




 I live Thompson and get ripped on here constantly (semi justifiably)  but who is going to take Landry's injured shitty self?  


Fareid  JT.   




 Assuming WCS is gone..   Would you take this?  Fareid is still a great player and not bad on price.  We'd lose alot by dropping JT and eventually we can write off Landry. What do you think about it? 


Edit: What if WCS is available?  




 But he is George Karl...  So we won't be worse.  




 Yea it is definitely a new rival.

 I want the Cotto fight as I have said many times in this sub.  But we won't get that til after canelo cotto.  




 Fuck your cake day 




 Fuck your cake day 




 But Khan deserves a Mayweather  fight.  He has trained and prepped for the fight.  Does he stand a chance cell IMO....  No but he has wearied it and besides GGG and Garcia...  I don't think there's anyone else other than Cotto IMO...  (only because cotto gave Mayweather an entertaining fight.)  Give Khan his fight no matter how shitty it's gonna be. There honestly isn't anyone else. (I'd take a Danny Garcia fight too.)  




 Sure but they haven't been writing about the Kings for 6 months...  They have been focusing on the playoffs... If they have it was pure speculation because I neverneveheard anybody talking talking about  d'allesandro leaving...  That is important whether we assumed it or not...  All I heard was "George Karl trading Cousins..." 

Oh BTW...  I'd check your calender..  I think it's broken 




 *"playoffs are over..  I  want 1500 words of bs on my desk by Monday.  MAKE IT RIDICULOUS OR ELSE"* 




 What doesn't the little fuck do...  




 All good nothing but growth.  All in good sport.  




 Lol I'm weak 




 Fuck man..  Curry went 7th... People sleeping on draft day.  "Here's lawson a guy we need to get rid of.  Let me take your shitty 6th pick...?"   C'mon man.  6th is a good pick in what looks like a good draft.  




 Just about to say this....  About time we got some quality names thrown. Lou,  Cousins,  Gay,  and Collison?  Pshhh get out.  That's a squad. 

Edit: I'm assuming we still have our pick.  




 Haha we hate Hickson more I'm sure. In all I'd love to have Ty but not for our pick.  If you wanted to trade up and dump salary I'd do that. And take Hickson and dump him after we give you McCallum.  




 Little chance of effect?  Damian Lillard was the 6th pick?  A 7'0 defensive 5 has great impact...  You are making assumptions on notions you can't justify. We can't project anything about any pick.  If you are asking me if I would rather gamble on a franchise changer or take the sure thing at improving 1 step of my franchise,  I take the gamble because we can sign free agents with the money we save from Ty.  5s don't come very often.  Our post would be stacked and we could sign a 1 or 2 for probably cheaper than Ty or maybe attract an even better guard with all the talent we now have.  




 You are making Lawson sound like he is LeBron. (meaning he has the power to take us to the ship)  I agree that Lawson is great but it was known since last year that Lawson was on the trading block. I would rather hold the pick until 6th to see if WCS falls.  Call us on draft day.  You guys are dumping Lawson in my opinion no matter what. Winslow wouldn't be a horrible pick.  But you are right,  only time will tell if we are stupid enough to give you guys 6th + 7th + Stauskas or McCallum (you keep putting McCollum who is on the blazers)  while you dump Lawson and Hickson on us like you guys keep talking about on your thread.  




 ^ Fuckin trippin

Edit: We have a capable point guard in Collison.  Lawson would be great for our team but over a defensive 5...?  You are insane. Lawson has shown what he can do...  WCS could be a future asset at a much more reasonable cost. Let's be frank...  You don't want lawson as much as lawson doesn't want you guys.  Just because you want a 6th and 7th pick doesn't mean you get to wish it upon yourself....  Hence my first statement.  




 He replied, "it's hard man..  I got to much love for the hoes"  




 WCS or Lawson? lol I'm insulted 




 He was just a fun player for me to watch.   




 - Travis outlaw

- Cole Aldrodge

- IT


Edit: This I purely fun.  Not necessarily right or wrong.  Just who do you wish we didn't get rid of whether it was right to or not.

 Do what I do for the last two years... 

- Compliment the shirt: "Hey!  that's a nice shirt!  Is it new?" 


- Ask them what team Iggy came from: "He was a sixers right? Who cares the guy is a shooting machine"


- Ask their favorite player: "Currys daughter.  Have you seen X video!?" 


- Ask what Kerr did differently this year than last year: "It's that defense thoooooo" 

- And my all time favorite...  Why do you root for GSW?: "Nor Cal rocks man..." 


Only thing worse is the band wagoner that come next year once we take 8-6th seed...  









 Fuck your cake day 




 I honestly feel this would be the biggest move the owner could do.  Such a bad stigma as an organization.  Time to change our reputation.

 Fuck your cake day 




 Doesn't need to be to children... It would reflect Jobs childish nature and his neck for minimalism.  Most adults watch Pixar movies anyways but a story of early success to a terrible downfall to overcome and accomplish what he did isn't a bad children story. You can make jobs the "Grumpy"  character who gets nicer towards the end of the movie through interactions with the other characters in his life.  




 A part of me honestly feels this would be a great way to tell the story of Jobs. Stop trying to find an actor to play Jobs but instead let Jobs live through a company he helped flourish.  




 Of course...  It worked for America didn't it?  









 Fuck your cake day

 Basically a bunch of fat fucks who work for reddit and Emperor Pao need more money to fill their faces with doughnuts so they are cleaning up Reddits image so they removed /r/Fatpeoplehate. 


Some fat fucks cheered while most sneered. Blah blah blah freedom of speech and expression blah blah blah. They decide to flood /r/all with multiple subs and gild these genius ideas which give back to the imposing fat fucks. Dust settles and Reddits richer,  fatter and quieter.  




 That fucking skank 




 That's what I mean...  If he's pretending about needing help to go viral than fuck this guy.  I've been combing to try and find a way to contact youtube 




 If this is a shitty attempt to go viral....  I swear.  If not I really hope we can help him. 


But so help me God... If you're not dead.

 Fair Oaks Brew pubhas craft beers. It's new so closes early. Around 10-11.

This place is in old folsom which is a nice place to go on weekends. Killer food as well.Samuel Hornes Tavernis great.

If your willing to travel,Low Brauis a mainstay for the "Hipster" crowd downtown and is always packed.

If your looking for just a place to blow off steam and play pool or something, Players bar and grill has a ton of options and sterling bridges is a nice place to just be in. All relatively close to gold river. (15 minutes)
