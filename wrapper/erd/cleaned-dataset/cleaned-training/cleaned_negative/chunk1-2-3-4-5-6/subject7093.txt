 Been doing this since I turned 21!   Little bit of Halo and some CoD with the friends then go out and make ass's of ourselves! 
 




 I do snowboard in the winter.  I love it!  Had the same board for some years now.   Rome Graft w/ Burton custom bindings.   It's been good to me. 




 I tried it and it didn't turn out to well.  I get the speed-wobbles bad on fast inclines.   I can't control my breaking. 




 I actually played poker since 10nth grade high school.  I did local matches around my last area and it was a blast!   You need that money to make money tho.   I'll have to check if there is any close casinos. 




 I just started mountain biking.    




 I have terrible shoulders, here is a few of my accidents that led me to the ER.

1. Thanksgiving playing Wii tennis with the gf  (dislocated shoulder)
2. Driving down the road and I sneeze   (dislocated shoulder)
3.  Climbing out of the lake using a ladder to get on the dock (dislocated shoulder)
4. Eating a girl out and she moves her leg to quick (dislocated shoulder)
5.  Reaching to the top cabinet at my apartment (dislocated shoulder)

There is a lot more and always explaining to the ER nurses always comes with laughs and tears (from me) 














 Thanks for the replies!  When we first moved in it was not bubbling, but after awhile bother apartments started bubbling in both spots.  I pointed it out to my landlord awhile ago on a mid term inspection.   I would fix it myself even since it would cost about $50.00 and my labor.   Which is better then $400.00.  I will call them again or the mangement team for complex.   

I just didn't know if there was any loop holes to this. 




 I live in an apartment complex.  It has 7 total apartments.  4 of them were redone including mine and a friends that lived next door.  The friend actually moved out last week and while we were moving a tv stand it clipped this linoleum flooring and tore it.   It's only in the entry way.  Anyway where it caught the flooring was because the flooring was actually bubbling up.  They barely put glue down it seems like.  Underneath is another linoleum flooring, but seems to be glued down a lot better.  It's just really beat up.  

The flooring in my apartment is also bubbling like it was in my friends apartment.  I contacted the landlord a couple times but no response.  

Am I screwed on the damage deposit?  I can upload pics for a better idea too.

 His name is Flip.  Maybe it's a her, they never really disclose during the show.  The character was introduced in the late early/mid 2000's.  The producer of show the felt they needed a character that the more "special kids" could feel apart of the show.  This was the last ditch effort the big wigs would try to save the show.   So far, the ratings of the show have increased enough to keep it aired.  They should pull through for more seasons.  The real news is who plays the character "Flip", none other than the infamous graffiti artist, Banksy. 




 Plus, who the fuck is gonna tell someone over the internet not to adopt a pet.

 How do you, AgeMarkus and Linkrobin know each other?  I went through Linkrobin's comments and saw that you would confront them on the repost.  Linkrobin just denies it in a funny niave way.  It was all pretty funny.   Fill me in on your story.

 I feel like this game has a great concept.  I think a nice layout of the HUD would make this game stand out over other FPS genres.  Plus with multiplayer, possibilities of game types and tweaks are limitless. 

If there is a game already like this or in the making, please let me know! 

 Note:  I'll expand more on this once I know this already doesn't exist. 
























 I have two habits, one I do more frequently than the other, whenever I am under those stages. The one I do the most is I put my backhand up to my face, so my knuckles are barely touching my lips. I than proceed to move my hand up and down so my lips hit each knuckle. I have no idea why I do this, but I been doing it since toddler I guess. The second, is that I take my thumb and pointer finger and gently rub my earlobe with my thumbnail ( --that could be wrong ) while applying pressure with my pointer. 

Both of these habits really soothes me I guess? I become relaxed and feel focused while doing one or another. What about you reddit? 

Do you have any strange habits?

 Alright Reddit, I'm heading downtown now to go bar hopping.   I will be alone for the most part.  I want you to give me drink ideas!  Something that you like or I should try.   I will order and try each one and report back with brief opinion on each drink.

 Come on now... Nobody accepts American Express. 




 Sometimes I will buy a pack of smokes for the weekend if I know Im going to be drinking.   I don't smoke otherwise.   Anyway last Saturday night my friends and I were outside a bar having a cig and a homeless guy walked up to us and asked for a cig.  My friends kinda ignored him and I just flat out offered him my pack with the lighter.   He started tearing up and he thanked me as if I saved him from his poverty life.  It gave me such a weird feeling overall.  I mean those won't help him in life, but even hurt him more.   It just confused me.  :( I hope he's ok.     









 It reminds me of my ex. 




 It is a parody everyone.  Nevermind, faith restored in Jack Black! 









 you r fukd 




 I bet that was so gratifying when you pulled the ends and you got that slight suction feeling.   




 My roommate has a pet ferret.  We would do "ferret bombs" where you would run up to someone lying on the couch with the ferret and stick it under their shirt or up their pant leg.  Next you would grab a squeeek toy and squeeze the shit out of it making that god awful noise.   This would drive the ferret crazy which would lead to biting and burrowing.   Man I can't wait for school start again :/

If someone makes a joke around a group of friends does everyone inform that person that they are not funny?   I love the gaming subreddit, but it's not like people are posting jaw dropping facts here.  Mostly repost and some fun OC.   




 I like how people call out others for being immature or acting like a 12 year old.    It's a joke, thats all,  and for someone to be calling out someone who is on a site based around inside little immature jokes.   Make no sense.

 I dated a girl for 5 years in which time I bought this Tiffany's heart ring.   We broke up she moved an hour away for school.  Fast forward three years I started dating this other who had the exact same ring.    

Turns out her ex bf was friend with my ex's new bf.    My gf went over to their apartment saw the ring on my ex n told her former bf she really liked it.    He bought it for their anniversary.     

TL:DR bought ex a ring new gf has same ring which she got the idea from my ex.

Good day! 









 Can you buy/order this anywhere in the US? 









 She's pretty wet, right now.  




 That or he brought it to work to sell to one of his co- workers or vice veracity  




 More importantly, this guy needs to get a new belt or tighten that thing.  




 Is Bill dying? 




 Someone reported my sisters gusher blunt pic, and I told her about it.   She said "ha!"   

Hope that helps  




  DON'T STOP


 THINKING ABOUT TOMORROW  




 I too want to feel like a whore
 




 When I was just a little version of me now, I caught one of these guys about 3 blocks from my house.   I cuffed him/her into my hand and ran like hell home to show my rents.   When I finally arrived home I called my Dad   Mom to the front steps.   As they were standing in front me I opened my hand to reveal a dead baby frog.   

I killed him/her and I never can let it go.

I'm sorry... 




 So weird.   I just glanced at the pic and I guessed MN.   I'm from the iron range and everything just looks to familiar!  




 Aight thanks!  









 sorrrry 









  25?! Good for her! Here's hoping she has many more months ahead. 




 The Taj Mahal for ants? 




 6900$ is a lot of cash 




 Woot!  Another Duluthian! 




 What comes to mind is those dish sink cleaners with the soap gel in the handle.     Once in awhile you can tell water leaked into the handle.    
Which if was toothpaste would basically ruin it.

Also, make the next two years awesome! 




 My monies on number 58.  He's on fire.   




 I was waiting for it to pop out at the end! 




 People talking about Mario and everyone gets gold coins next to their name?     




 If I tried that in my neighborhood, it would be covered in dicks or stolen.    




 I have to agree with these 2.  I been doing this awhile and the biggest mistake a lot of people make is running "flashy" aluminum parts.   They look great if you plan on keeping this thing on the shelf otherwise first wreck you will start bending stuff.

Switch it to the RPM plastics.   Great strong looking stuff! 




 Looks like Jffy or whatever his name is in the back left corner 




 No shit?!  I walk my crabs everyday.    




 Seth when you make a movie with all your friends how do you decide who gets paid what? 




 He's going to stab himself 




 Is this from MN?   Where I live, we have roads like this all over place.    




 Someone do that fancy spancy 3D rendering shit.   This seems fake.

 Helios?   Or something of that nature.   I remember them coming out in 2005. They didn't last long.    




 This is how a super villain/hero is born!   




 The dog is terrifying on the bottom.
 




 Really?  I guess i'll be back Thursday. 




 Porn? 









 For me it was sitting at those kid tables with crayons and a re-run of fox N the hound in the background, while my mom shopped at jcpenneys or herbergers.  




 They are fairly short, but how do you remember these convos?     

Do you play into the convos now to make them funnier or awkward ect.. ?

Do you eliminate words in the convo? 




 I hope a meteorite never brightens my day.   




 Why didn't they ask Carlton to have a seat with them! 




 Is this from that new JGL movie? 




 Deer hunting?  




 Buhl? 




 Not even adjusting them correctly.  Some cars/trucks do not work with HIDs even if you adjust them.   You need the proper housing for the HID's too.  

Also, to the people who do buy them, but don't get High/Low if the vehicle needs them and instead goes with just "Highs" well fuck you.

I hope your ballast starts on fire.   




 where the hell is the one penguin who took a quick right going? 




 Or girls have perfect hiding spots for them.   




 Producers pay for everything and directors get to spend everything.    




 And if the little dog was a person it would be me.  

Just me and Liam  




 They literally camouflaged the missile with the vehicle.    So, it blends in perfect.     

Did they make these wheelers specially for carrying missiles or are these common military grade?   




 I know, right?  Who would want to play for the Mets.   




 Whoa, I just streamed LNJF and you were his guest.    After the show ended I decided to look more into you on the web.  Made a quick stop at Reddit and here you fkn are!    




 Probably not the best way to get a cat outta the tree.   




 What a basket case.   




 Boner bread 




 What's on tap?    




 And baby Joseph Gordon-Levitt is adorable.   




 Unbearable.  




 Better than seashells.  




 Isn't he getting sued for tax fraud or something on his skateparks he's building?   I would google, but I just wasted the rest of my typing time on this sentence.   




 He's half way there! 




 Oh, he did it.  




 You should come back to MN and WI and do a Brewery Beer and Food off! 




 On a side note I just had a nostalgic masterbating moment on this photo.  Havent seen it for years. 




 I just played fallout 3 last year and Fallout NV this year.   First time for any of those kind of games and I have to say Fallout 3 sucked me in way more than NV.   I dunno what it was, but I'm having a hard time even finishing NV.

Only thing I regret is not reading up on the game a little bit before playing.  I never had a dog companion...  




 Just incase the video get blocked.

Also, stop trying to use me for Karma.

 I learned this after my roommate left and wrote with permanent marker on the fridge.  




 Let's write a short story together!   




 I was shocked.  




 Yes.

 Next time you are at a buffet, take a look at their plates.   The dishes have the same layout to hide dirt just invade  




 How do all 3 of you know his mom?   




 How do you know that's the kitty's name?   How did it past? 




 My recommendation is to hip check the side of the machine.    




 And they did not do this on purpose.    




 Good thing the dog isn't turned around, otherwise they would have a tail light out. Ha ha he 




 damnit,  paranoid. 









 It really ties the room together.   




 Did you stab him? 




 Not one of your proudest moments, I'm sure.

 What's even funnier is that last pic of Jonah is actually taken right after a frightful scare of drowning.

 Drew, What happened to that pool table that sat outside? 




 In the next two iPhones I bet this will be a feature with the screen.

 It's just to much labor now to rob a gas station or an atm.    Cameras are at every block and everyone has a camera on them now.   It's not worth it for the work and time (potentially even more time) on planning now for small advances.    




 It was probably laundry day, so he wore that shirt.

 It's funny I used to envy my friends household when I was younger.   Wealthier family, cleaner home and a distinct smell.   Now, living on my own trying out different routines. I will come across certain smells, distinct smells, that remind me of my childhood and I forgot what point I was making. Nvm  




  I got a similar  text when I started college in 2008 except I had a cat. And that cat didn't miss me either she was just ratting me out.   

This is what happened:

In my room I had a old TV stand that had about 1/2 of clearing from the carpet to the base.  Well young me used to keep everything under there.   Cigs-Porn-Condoms-Pot and anything else you can think of that a teenage boy would horde from his parents.   9-12th grade I was keeping items under here.

Now I moved away and completely forgot about my hidden stash, since I only lived an hour away my parents kept my room the same, so I would have a place to crash.  

Well about 2 weeks after I moved I guess my cat went into my room and started pawing at everything under the tv stand.   Parents came into the room and saw couple cigs and edge of a mag.  

Got an awesome call that day!


Thanks cat. 




 That's normal, but now call CSI and have them check it for semen to do a DNA test   




 Yes I have. My Aunt lives there.   




 Hey look something that made me laugh in /r/funny.  




 Pretty sure it's a fitted hat.  

SnapBack would be quite bananas to make.   




 Seriously!  Everyone knows that's Minnesota.  




 You can see the fear in his eyes.   




 This Gif is me walking home at bar close.   




 Man if I was evil n had a truck and a couple friends and was pretty strong, I would steal that motor.   




 I'm wearing the exact same thing as nick besides the ring.   Even my sunglasses hanging on the shirt.    
Haha check it.

 Yes, good memories!  




 Seriously I was getting pissed, I was pretty determined it was a loop towards the end.

 Probably clogged, just run a snake pipe cleaner thru it. 




 Jerked him off to death.    




 I should of been more clear on this.   This is for only walk-ins I will do this.  We usually have a full day of schedule appt, but you get a couple walk-ins and most will set up a next day appt.   Some customers are either out of town or just can't get an appt set up.  These are the customer that will do a quick (15-30min) inspection.   Everyone should be charged the min, but I gift the nice patient ones.    

 




 Wasn't there someone who farted for their power
 




 Yes-  I work in an audio shop that does installs of all sorts.   We also troubleshoot a lot of oem products that come standard on most cars, common case is a factory radio.  
People will just swing in and state their problem with the factory tuner.  Mostly it just doesnt work, nothing coming out of the speakers and so forth.  

I hardly charge for this, if we don't find a problem or can't help you in the right direction to solve the issue.   There is some cases tho where I will charge the lowest labor charge I can.   These cases usually involve a customer that is rude either before check-out or during.   Usually goes like this

Me-  "Sir, we went thru the radio checked all connections and fuses.  We couldn't find anything out of the ordinary, but I believe the radio could be shot internally."

Customer- "Well there better not be a charge, if you didn't fix anything.  Now I have to bring it to another shop to waste more of my time."

Me-  "Sir, I will have to charge you the min labor fee for having the car looked at."

*Customer throws a fit*

Now if you don't want to be charged, this is the response I'm looking for

Me- "Sir, we went thru the radio checked all connections and fuses.  We couldn't find anything out of the ordinary, but I believe the radio could be shot internally."


Customer- "That's unfortunate.   Anyway, what do I owe ya?!'

Me- " Oh, nothing but I recommend this [Dealership] or [junkyard] for a factory radio replacement."

 Crap that curtain out of the photo and you got yourself an album cover  




 I too never liked that level on Mario64 




 vist:  metraonline.com   or    bestkits.com    to check what you will need
-Dash kit- Harness - Antenna Adapt-

Next find what you are looking for in a radio.   If you need just CD-USB-AUX - you can find radios for right around or less $100  for example heres a good radio

http://www.crutchfield.com/p_113KDC155U/Kenwood-KDC-155U.html?showAll=N search=kdc_155u skipvs=T

Now for speakers!  
The jeep should have 5.25 all around. 
You are not limited to that size tho.   You can place 5.25 -  6.0 - 6.5 
just needs adapters.

Now, since you have so many options this is where you will have to do some research.   
I deal with JL Audio and RE audio and love both brands, but worked with  a lot of other companies

1. [High End](http://www.crutchfield.com/p_136TR600CX/JL-Audio-TR600-CXi.html?tp=105)

2. [Low End](http://www.crutchfield.com/p_500SPS510/Alpine-SPS-510.html?tp=105)

This should keep you right around the $400 price point without install of course.

4. How is it working with the general public
5. Any secrets I should know?

Thank you

Really sucks when I have a day off of work and try to get some homework done or relax.     Can't say anything to the landlord tho cuz I have two dogs which I'm not paying for.   I think they know anyway.

 Always find a group of 3 or more and interact with all accordingly, only spending a tad bit more time with the one that you like.   If they start avoiding you or moving their group just dance off to another location with people.    This works best with a buddy or if you already have a gf.

 I love you and I need to tell my scary moment.  

I was in 10nth grade and went to Mexico for 10 days for my Spanish class.   Anyway one destination was Playa de Carmen?   If I remember correctly.    The class was looking for something to do when we stumbled upon snorkeling.    We all had to pay and watch a quick tutorial on the Do's n Don'ts.     We took boats out to our location of course and the whole class jumped in (20+).    We were rushed on this whole situation cause a storm was coming in and no one wanted to go thru the process of getting refunded.       

Anyway a girl n I were swimming around a pretty neat spot with coral
Reef just a couple feet under us.      Which was scary cause the waves started pulling me down into the reefs and u learned you didn't want to touch them.       

The waves started increasing in size and rain started to pour.      I took a quick glance up while trying to float myself away from the reefs to see the whole class dispersed amongst the water.        It got pretty sketchy quick when lighting and thunder arrived along with a heavy down pour.     With the waves increasing I kept getting hurled to the coral reefs that were inches underneath me.   I kept my head under to make sure I could get out of this clearing and not get hurt.    As soon as I made it out I looked up and couldn't see any of my classmates nor any of the boats.   I could barely even make out where the beach was.    
This is when I went into complete panic mode and started swimming frantically to
Just a dot in my vision.    As I swam and swam
All I could think about was drowning or getting washed out to sea.    I finally made it close to a boat and started yelling.     Turns out the boat I swam to was not a tourist boat but a couple Mexicans just doing their thing.    They helped me on and brought me to land.    

The teacher started doing head counts after that.  




 He dabbled in some coke  




 No he just experimented and had fun like every other person in their 20's.   But when you are a public figure no one likes dealing with those questions.   

 




 One of Jimmy's interns is a reddit user. (That I know, I'm sure there's more) The show slowly started incorporating bits and pieces from Reddit users to the show.    
I'm sure he will do it as long as the drug related questions from his earlier years don't flood the AMA.
