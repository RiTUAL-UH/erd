 what if... and bear with me here, what if wwe is doing the things it does with john cena to anger the iwc?   what if all the superman stuff is to make cena a meta heel, one that is specifically pushed to make a certain fan base angry,  he is over with casual wrestlers yes but that was probably the plan all along, get over with the casual and do what ever you can to anger the smarks... eh just a thought 









 i really want to do commissions because it seems more fun than just drawing them and keeping them around lol
