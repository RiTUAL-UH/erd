After five years of development, the Uralvagonzavod Research and Production Corporation has finalized manufacture of the first batch of Armata tanks and heavy personnel carriers. They have been included in Russias 2015 defense order, TASS said.

The new Armata armored tracked platform has reportedly combined and assimilated all the last decades major developments and innovations in battle vehicle design and construction. 
The platforms chief tank (T-14) sports an unmanned remotely controlled turret armed with a brand new 125 mm 2A82-1M smoothbore cannon. Its muzzle energy is greater than one of the worlds previously considered best cannons: the German Leopard-2 Rheinmetall 120 mm gun. 
The 125 mm gun has 15-20 percent improved accuracy and its rolling fire angular dispersion has improved 1.7 times. 

According to Russian media, the Armata tank might also come with a specially developed 152 mm gun, the most powerful ever cannon to be mounted on a main battle tank. 
The tanks turret will also carry a 30 mm sub-caliber ranging gun to deal with various targets, including low-flying aerial targets, such as attack planes and helicopters. 
A 12.5 mm turret-mounted heavy machine gun is reportedly capable of taking out incoming projectiles, such as anti-tank missiles. Its capable of neutralizing shells approaching at speeds of up to 3,000 meters per second. 
The tanks crew is securely enclosed in a multi-layer armored capsule separated from the ammunition container. The vehicle is fully computerized and only needs two servicemen to operate it. Each can also deploy the tanks weapon systems. 
The tanks targeting is reportedly done with an active-phased array antenna and a large variety of other sensors. 
The Armata platform allegedly has a fully mechanized electric transmission, powered by a 1,200 HP diesel engine. For greater efficiency, maintenance and repair schedules have been extended. 
Within its blueprint, the Armata armored vehicle has the potential to evolve into a fully robotic battle vehicle. 
According to preliminary estimates, 2,300 units are required for the Russian army.

 According to a new design specification from the Military-Industrial Commission in Moscow, a transport aircraft, dubbed PAK TA, will fly at supersonic speeds (up to 2,000 km/h) and will boast an impressively high payload of up to 200 tons. It will also have a range of at least 7,000 kilometers.

The PAK TA program envisages 80 new cargo aircraft to be built by 2024. This means in a decade Russias Central Command will be able to place a battle-ready armored army anywhere, Expert Online reports, citing a source in the military who attended the closed meeting.

The PAK TA freighters will be multilevel, with automated cargo loading and have the capability to airdrop hardware and personnel on any terrain.

With the development of a network of military bases in the Middle East, Latin America and Southeast Asia, which is expected to be completed during the same time period (by 2024), its obvious that Russia is preparing for a full-scale military confrontation of transcontinental scale, Expert Online says. 

A source who attended the closed meeting of the Military-Industrial Commission told the media outlet on condition of anonymity that he was shocked by the demands of the military.

According to the source, the PAK TA project has been ongoing for several years now and will eventually supplant the currently operating air freighters. But such a global mission statement for national military transport aviation has never been voiced before.

It means for the first time we have the objective of creating an operational capability to airlift a full-fledged army to any desired place on the planet, the source said. This means delivering a task force the size of the former NATO and the US troops in Iraq, in a matter of hours to any continent. In the context of the current military doctrine that defies comprehension, the source said.

The initial PAK TA specification entailed building subsonic air freighters with a conventional 900 km/h cruising speed and a moderate 4,500-kilometer range.
The program involves the creation of wide-body freighters, with payloads varying from 80 to 200 tons, to replace all existing Ilyushin and Antonov cargo aircraft.
The only operating aircraft with a comparable payload is the Antonov An-225 Mriya (up to 250 tons), but this is a one-off aircraft created specially for the Soviet Buran space shuttle program.

Last year, it was reported that future military air freighters will be developed by the Ilyushin Aviation Complex, with some experts saying the company may base designs on the Il-106 cargo plane (80 tons) project that won a government tender in the late 1980s, but was abandoned after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
Now, with ambitious specifications and objectives, the PAK TA is a truly next-generation transport aircraft.

 Great write-up, I can see his military values carried over into coaching, his interest in the intangibles of a player is what puts him over other coaces, he's going against the grain.

 The image was captured last week at the re-launching of the TIDAL music streaming service. While this is but a moment in time, it does provide a very useful body language teaching moment. 

Madonna is standing in a modified fig-leaf position. She is of course, a very alpha personality - yet in THIS particular moment, she's definitely feeling more beta and with a lower confidence level than she's been on many an occasion. 

Deadmau5 is standing with his hands in his back pockets and his thumbs-forward. This is a good alpha-beta hybrid stance and shows a high-confidence, but not one that is too high or too assertive.

Kanye West is standing with his arms crossed in front of his chest and without his hands visible. This signals he's defensive, closed-minded and - when we correlate this with his facial expression - we can say that Kanye is also feeling threatened and impatient. He wants out of this spot-light. He feels very beta and acquiescent to Jay Z's alpha, intelligence and relatively superior social skills. 

Jay Z has his hands behind his back. We cannot tell how they are clasped, yet we can say this is a very confident, alpha stance. It sends signals of leadership and strength - yet as with all alpha signals, if this is over-displayed (for longer durations) - it will transmit signals of hyper-alpha mindsets, arrogance, aloofness, and condescending emotional tones. It's not surprising that he's standing this way since he's the principle business actor of the new Tidal music-streaming service, but he should not remain this way for too long.

 I have seen some news organizations give credit and link back to the OP at the end of their article, that's why readers keep coming back because their not trying to be shady.

 I don't necessarily think their shortcomings just a different way of learning/thinking, maybe in the next century docs will find a way to turn on/off the switch you mention.  




 Wow amazing. 




 Yep thanks for your advice, no one mentioned litigation. We are provided with a ABA therapist already, private insurance so we do get collaborate and have things to work on at home, just want it to carry into the classroom, except there is so much pushback. Thanks for the education, you must be well versed in special education laws... 




 Yes I feel that my child needs one, we hired one through our insurance provider so there is no cost to the district, we just want for the BCBA to provide services and collaborate one day a week in school. One day a week is that so difficult? This is to ensure what their teaching my son is being done right, which so far has not been the case. Just food for thought.  









 We spoke with the IEP team and our private ABA therapist is allowed in the classroom for observation, but I want for the therapist to collaborate with the school and provide services to my son as well. I don't know how Florida and Maryland Special Education laws could vary.

 Nice rebuttal.  




 No one wants any casualties.  




 I know they deserve a slow demise but will they, is the public to attached to the brand to buy anything they sell? 




 DCGS continues on. 




 Great work, it's neat.  




 Amazing 




 Let me clarify, 12 year old needs braces and 6 year old needs spacers for 6 months. 




 Yes its time. 




 I thought that was low the ref wasn't even sure what was going on. 




 I especially like when Domino's has 50 percent off. 




 I would like to see how Chip Kelly and Bill Belichick prioritize and base their values.

Winnefeld Jr., right, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and his wife, Mary, present a USO-Metro Merit Award to Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning during the USO of Metropolitan Washington-Baltimore's 33rd Annual Awards Dinner in Washington, D.C., March 24, 2015. Manning received the award for his support of the military through USO tours and visits with wounded, ill and injured service members. 







































 Players don't play for the personal achievements.  

















































 Seriously I would've liked Rondo to stay in Dallas.  



















 Tmobile has a 5gb LTE data plan with 100 minutes, for 30 dollars.  




 Great creation definitely needs to be played during the Survivor Finale/Reunion.  





























 You can set up a three way call with Tmobile and your bank, that should resolve the problem.  




 Yes, pm email.  







































 Mike is always playing, smart. 




 Buy the Zerolemon case from Amazon, not the best color palette, but you won't be disappointed.  




 I bought the Zerolemon from Amazon, don't have to charge my phone for about a day and a half, the majority of the time I get 12-13 onscreen hours.  




 How can I log in with a CAC card? 









 Hey its not the show Big Brother.  




 I can't wait for the jury to roast the final contestants, maybe snakes and rats proportions.  




 Hopefully producers read this comment for next season.  




 ELI5? 




 Here's for hoping.  




 Total let down.  




 He keeps preaching that mantra but haven't seen him practice it, intriguing.  




 Just picture Will flopping down the slide previous episode.  




 He my mind was made up on getting rid of Mike and then BOOM I wanted him to stay against the Blues.  




 In the preview for next episode, someone goes into Dans bag and it's discovered that he has two votes.  




 Wow, what a disappointment, really wanted Dan to make a big move and break up the blues. 









 [Here's how they compare] (http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/04/how-googles-project-fi-pricing-stacks-up-to-the-competition/) 









 We all know how well the VA has helped individuals with all the donations.  




 You can get the free router to mitigate that and increase your households wifi speed. 




 I confirm this, I had that plan located at the bottom of the page, 5gb, I think 100 min cap, but you can use Google Voice, if your out of minutes. Was a great plan, and then I switched to the 2 for $100 on Tmobile. I would seriously spend more if I didn't have unlimited. I think it's a nice gimmick for them to say, you only pay what you use, well that would be a lot of dinero. 









 The prices seem outrageous, they want to charge $10 per GB, when you can stay put with what you have know and have unlimited. I believe T-Mobile is $80 unlimited, come on, not sure what Google Wireless is thinking on this one. 




 Actually, you'd be better off staying put, the prices seem downright outrageous.

 This sounds like it could potentially save a lot of money. Im wondering how these compare to T-Mobile, ATT, and Sprint? 


































 It sounds like a way for the government to ensnare some of those that are not financially savy, but on the other hand that lump sum can help with a down payment on a house or to purchase a vehicle clear and free. 




 Ill jump on the Vote Mike out bandwagon. 




 True, it will depend on what they contribute, and a Mustang seems like a better idea in the short term. 




 Look like the string of 1% will be broken, possibly. 









 Can I stay in Reddit with the ESPN app? 














 On mobile.  




 What about in the thread for those of us not near a television?  




 Is there a way to have the score update automatically at the top of this thread and all of the following game threads?  




 The Jet can't hurt his former team. 




 Let's go Mavs. 




 Or another brief that's not able to show metrics of progression on the force. 
























 I find it hypocritical that the congressman mentioned the changes would not yield much in savings but strengthen the force, if I ever heard such a crock of BS. 




 Thanks 





























 Three belts and a crown at risk, wow, how exciting for the winner and devastating for the loser. 
























 Is this something to be worried about?  What's the consequences of not going through with the match, other than a lot of Benjamins?  



















 Are there any that populate instantaneously?  Feedly often takes hours to update.  




 Feedly populates slow but has a good layout. Is there any that populate faster and not hour later? 














 Laser by chance?

 Yep, heard that before,  dress right dress. Different culture I suppose.  




 Sometimes humans over think it and it constantly plays out in life and sports, if only I had some examples.  




 I think she'll scale it back, hoping to get some rest in her legs. I think she needs to partner up with Desi Linden and jump in her training plan. 




 Disappointed Hastings dropped out, Sarah Hall though about it too in the LA Marathon but thought better. She said once you DNF once it's always on your mind to do it again.  




 She has no speed. 




 Any idea when this "new" APFT will be phased in? 



















 How does he have time for this? I run 40 miles a week and have no free time. 









 Are they trying to mirror the Good Wife?  




 Wow makes you stop and pause.  




 Today was not their day. 


































 Interesting, thanks.  




 Nice you must get deals on the shoes. 




 Most likely.  




 That's a great honor.  



















 I would like to see what Belichick and Co prioritize to avoid the so called Bubble? In years past they have traded down and that has paid dividends, but with the Patriots getting older, maybe he takes a chance on a high salary player but I doubt it as we have seen with Welker and other players looking for large contracts.  














 I've always wondered? It must be neat to see Rich Eisen, Chris Berman, Lindsay Czarniak running around.  




 Scroll below, it's been a pattern.  




 Cracked up. 




 Wow how'd you get selected straight out of AIT? 









 http://www.runnersworld.com/general-interest/treadmill-half-marathon-world-record-set-at-boston-marathon-expo

 Does anyone have a copy of an ESPN contract, maybe has a morality clause.  




 The company came out and defended her, hoping ESPN/Disney let's her keep her job. 




 Or the media is trying to succeed and protect one of their own. 




 How about a no more makeup.  












































 Do you have a recommendation for an app then? Tasker seems good for the automation I need like automatically turning on mobile hotspot and such? Standing by... 














 Of course there was an unannounced fourth stop, there needs to be some sort of cameras installed along all of the road ways as a back stop for evidence. Business Camera's don't seem to work to well. In Russia all vehicles come with dash cams. 









 Yup I saw that, what a jokster. 




 Kudos to them for all of the hard work. It doesn't look easy by the way.  




 Seriously what is their problem?  




 I've actually have been surprised with all of the tales. I actually get 100 MBs where I reside it's great.  




 It was only a matter of time, he deserves it. People need to stop with the crab jokes.  




 I tried this app and its great.  




 Is there a free APK? 




 Do you have instructions? 




 I would have to go with Ugly Betty.  




 Garmin Connect and Strava.  














 I would suggest those of you that are heavy users purchase this battery. Stand by time is easily 1 day and 16 hours plus. Screen time varies between 10 and 12 hours of heavy usage.

[Dan and Sierra discussed Mike's claims that they were at the bottom of the majority alliance; Dan later attempted to comfort Shirin about Will's comments at the previous Tribal Council. Reward challenge: Divided into two groups of four, the teams were given four barrels, two wood planks, and rope to cross the beach without any part of their bodies or the planks touching the ground, or else they had to restart. The first team across won a trip on a catamaran, complete with a feast of hamburgers and pie.
After the team of Mike, Sierra, Shirin and Rodney accidentally placed a plank on the ground, they decided to each roll on a barrel to make up time, but they were unable to do so and Carolyn, Dan, Tyler, and Will won the challenge. Back at camp, Sierra campaigned to Rodney to get rid of Tyler for being a threat and to take Shirin to the end because no one would vote for her to win, though Rodney neither believed Tyler was a threat nor trusted Shirin. On the reward trip, Carolyn, Tyler, and Will did their best to make sure Dan stayed loyal to them.
Immunity challenge: Each castaway held onto a rope handle attached to 25% of their body weight as of the beginning of the game. If the rope unspooled and the weight dropped, a bucket of water dropped on the castaway's head and they were eliminated; the last man and woman remaining won immunity.
Carolyn and Mike outlasted Shirin and Rodney to win immunity, again thwarting the majority alliance's plans. Though the majority alliance targeted Shirin, she lobbied Dan and Sierra to take out Tyler. Tyler searched through Dan's bag and discovered his extra vote advantage. Mike attempted to realign with Dan, his former closest ally, but was unsuccessful, and Mike considered playing his idol on Shirin. At Tribal Council, Shirin told everyone that getting rid of her would be a bad idea and that they should get rid of Tyler. Right before the vote, Mike unveiled his hidden immunity idol and gave it to Shirin, and claimed that Shirin was going to vote for Tyler and he was going to vote for another member of the dominant alliance, and told the other members of the alliance to vote for Tyler to ensure their safety. Ultimately, Mike did not play the idol for Shirin, but the dominant alliance called his bluff and Shirin was voted out, though Tyler and Will voted against Dan.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor:_Worlds_Apart#11)

 He's definitely not showing the 3 C's.

 Carolyn, I'm proud of you for not giving that big baby your hard-earned reward.  




 Will doesnt know what he's doing. 




 Pull Rodneys shirt off and stab him in the heart. 




 Yes Jeff join in for the red team. 




 Schefter m just think this source is credible otherwise he wouldn't regurgitate this info and risk his reputation.  




 Schefter usually is right most of the time.  




 What are the odds the suspension is overturned?  




 One way to circumvent the installation fee is to forcefully ask that it be waived. If that doesn't work hang up and try again. I'm paying 59.99 for 100MB.

 Is he still going to be in the building, If so he will steal the spotlight.  




 No one knows what chips stances are our weekday he's trying to do.  




 Then when you hear another one repeat.  




 Why would he, he's on a great team, he could always go to a noncontendig team.  




 Thought you wrote neanderthal.  




 The northeast is nice with a Walmart near by, the east side is nice as well but a bit of a longer drive.  




 198 miles of fun.  




 Going to run Ragnar Cape Cod.  




 I found a scorpion on my sofa next to my child when we lived there, pretty scary, sure it was painless but still scary.  




 Gross  




 More probable than not, come on your kidding me right?  




 He has to their is no option, otherwise a new precedent will be set.  




 Well that made me chuckle out loud.   




 If Tom so much gets a scratch on him then there will be roots and it will set a new precedent and the NFL will never be the same again.   




 Their sole purpose in life is to bring ratings to ESPN.   




 I'm in board we need to start a petition.   




 I'd like to see Spencer and Boston Rob team up, they could do some damage, and Boston Rob may even propose at the finale.   




 Fans would like to see Keith return.   




 Sore loser.   




 That I think fans would pay for definitely.   




 You and me both, these children can't even protect themselves, let alone tell an adult.   




 $5,000 bond are you kidding me, that just doesn't seem right.   




 There's time.  




 Even so, he as the Commissioner must be weighing out his options, he wants to avoid a repeat of a debacle.   




 Can't wait for it my kids love Mario.   




 I'm wondering if the league would actually punish Brady?  




 Between 12 and 15 miles your pick.  




 We had three runners drop out for Ragnar Cape Cod 8-9 May, is anyone looking to fill in?  




 It was actually a funny show.   




 I just wanted to get a quote but the site wants my CC info. I'm just traveling 30 miles.  




 It's 30 miles no thanks.

 The first five games on the schedule look important for the NFL.   




 Great visualization.   




 It's going to be a good fight.   




 I live in Bel Air, the group is leaving from Annapolis. The original plan was to pick me up on the way but they mentioned some tolls on the way to Hull, MA. They're thinking in order to circumvent tolls they would go the way of the Bay Bridge. This would totally bypass my location and therefore would need to drive an hour and a half to meet them in Annapolis. If I new how much the tolls were I could pay those.   




 Yeah now that you mention it, yes they all are similar.  Why don't producers and directors notice this, or they just ignore it in the hopes of making money.  




 Are there any parts where attire is blue jeans and Polo?  




 Ok 




 I'm trying to have options, how much tolls would cost if we went through them vs not.  




 There's nothing there.

 Is this a remake of The Heat with Melissa McCarthy and Sandra Bullock? 




 This season flew by, it truly did.  




 Joe comes back into the game, would be epic.  




 ALC is terribly elementary and don't learn anything.   




 Huachuca must be a blast.  




 Won't Floyd retire by then? 




 I'd surely be interested in more information.  




 I would like to go, basically you need to have a suit, I'd really like to go but don't own any of these items.  




 Define logic.  




 Don't they get stitches?  




 Yes it's in this slide show. http://soldiersystems.net/2015/05/05/ocp-rollout/ 




 How would that go?  




 It does read that way a bit.  




 Except the plans are worthless.  









 So in the meantime while police are being called, in this article 2 hours what is being done to ensure safety if no one is legally allowed to restrain the individual, are they just running amok?  




 Previously unseen rifle presented at Ukrainian arms inspection 




 But with special needs kids there are no luxuries, that's why there are action plans agreed upon by the staff, and parents. I know the article states the child was injuring himself, but you can't tell me the police needed to be called to provide a bearhug, come on. There are adults that can provide a bearhug until the agreed upon action plan is floored through as agreed (ie) called the parents baring any significant safety issues.   




 What's the average guaranteed money for a rookie? 




 LTE at that.  



















 Yes I think putting up with not getting signal for a minute while in the country side is fine, so long as it's not unusable.  




 I agree that there's nothing to work towards. There's needs to be some sort of carrot to work for but also the franchise has to show some loyalty, where's the line drawn.   




 Why can't they use commercial computers, my desktop at home works better as in zero lag.  




 Come on, seriously, he keeps turning 40. 




 It couldn't of been that bad, are you serious, I was going to purchase one later today, but im not hearing positive reviews. 



















 Is Verizon really that much better? I believe tmobile speed is faster especially in the city. I guess it depends on where you are.  




 Will Verizon play hard ball and how can T-Mobile ensure that customers that don't sign up for magenta are given the right to the same plan on Verizon. 














 Yes that is correct depending on the state. The only two states I know allow BCBA's to provide services in the classroom are Florida and Pennsylvania. I would not suggest an aide as they serve more as an assistant rather than a board certified behavioral analysts. Look into what BCBA's do and see if that is right for you and your son, I'm sure it will be. Additionally, if you don't feel the classroom has BCBA or principals there are centers you can go to where they provide BCBA play based services with other children. Your sons transition into adulthood starts now and the curriculum they go through know will set them on their way.

Feel free with any questions. 




 Geneva conventions.  




 Psychedelic  




 He over thought this game simple as that.  




 Did the dog have a go pro attached to his tail? 




 Good gracious what's the secret, looks delicious.  




 All good options, just depends on the coaching staff and Dirk on who they want to bring in.  




 Who do you think could fill that role?  




 I thought Amare was a good PF. 




 What a load of BS. Seriously, that's the sole purpose I bought my own so they wouldn't give me the run around let alone remotely access my modem.  




 Great time things considered. Just keep moving, great job.  




 True fans at heart, had a great run but time to go fishing, rest, recuperate and get back to working out soon enough.  




 Classic Popovich answer, no other response will do.  




 As much as Dirk has been the go to player for a while, I think it may be time for him to be a sixth man.  




 I thought that was hilarious. For everyone else probably not.  




 What was the miscommunication that it ended up in the press, already a bad start to this week's news cycle.  




 Did you PMCS before you touched it.  




 Steph deserves it, he worked really hard, especially during the summer months.  
























 The hike is at a 15:00 min pace, that is pretty quick. 




 I know there are some fans here. 









 I think for week 11 Mike is safe either way, I do agree with r/whycraig he is near the bottom.
