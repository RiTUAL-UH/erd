 It has embodied the soul of mario. 




 Possibly dumb question but I've never figured it out: How does one download a fan edit? It doesn't seem like links are openly available. Do you have to purchase a bootleg DVD or something?
 




 As someone who was born in 1994, this was actually pretty mindblowing to me how that presented these "new technologies." I guess this was cutting edge! 




 weak skulls 




 I'm on here documenting that something has landed on my roof. I'm horrified. I think somebody's trying to break in through my chimney. 




 ...What the hell did I just watch???? Requiem for a dream 2? Christ. 




 Turn Up! 




 Haha yes! This. 




 Ever wonder if religion could be totally wrong, but there is in fact a divine power behind the workings of the universe? 




 Nice, I'll definitely check out those shows! I love that kind of stuff. And I've heard so much about A Brief History of Time, I'll try to grab a copy. Thanks. 




 Hi guys, I posted this. I've been having some very grown-up thoughts lately. I'm 20 years old, and I've been an atheist as long as I can remember. I, like what seems like most people on the internet, always thought that religion is stupid.


This year, I've been revisiting some of my ideals. I became obsessed with space after watching 2001, the Cosmos, Contact, and Interstellar. The way I viewed the universe started to change. Are the scriptures all just gypsies and fairies, or is there any truth to be found? What is beyond the universe, and why did we come into existence? It's almost like I went full circle with my beliefs. Concepts that always seemed impossible to me now make more sense than ever. Marijuana and the art of film has given me a newfound spirituality. Pi and The Last Temptation of Christ gave me remarkable insight into what religion actually could mean. I thought that believing in God was close-minded. Now I wonder: is being an atheist the real close-mindedness? Shutting out all religious ideas doesn't seem 100% logical to me.


So tell me: ***Does God Exist?*** Has anyone else struggled with their sense of religious identity before? If anyone has any good science to bring to the discussion, that'd be great. Think philosophically, atheists. What lies beyond? Nothing? What could lie beyond? Could our consciousness transcend this dimension into another? Could extraterrestrial life be our biblical "God"?


Thank you! (I love having my mind blown!) :) 




 Does God Exist? *Could* a God Exist? I'd love mature opinions on the subject.

Thank you! It's all just so confusing!(I love having my mind blown!) :) 




 I was a leasing agent for an apartment complex in Tempe, and the sales techniques they taught us to sucker rich college kids into signing contracts were very unethical. But maybe all sales are like that. Pure *evil.* 




 With the CoCo! 




 She might also be doing it for you, as well. If a parent is telling their children that Santa does actually exist, there might be a degree of pressure in playing along. 




 Could someone explain the deep web? 




 Best thing I can tell you is:
*Don't over-think it*

Seriously, just go with the flow. 




 It depends on the mood. If you're trying to make out with this girl, I guess it's kind of complicated. Try gently rubbing your lips the back of your hand until you get a rhythm that feels right. 




 And that, kids, is how I met your mother. 




 GTAV on XB1 and a couple pairs of vans. 




 Best picture @ a film festival. Won a Best Buy gift card...(wtf) 




 What? 




 Just go with the flow. Let it come naturally. 




 She probably already knows, honestly. 




 So you jizzed on your burger, what's the big deal? 




 DSmeet   ABXY.... :'( R.I.P. 
























 **Buy, buy, buy!** trusst mee IAMA a stalk bro-ker 




 I thought the point of pre-ordering was so that you were guaranteed a copy if they ran out of stock... so what's the point with digital purchases? They can't run out... 




 Plot twist: toxic gas 




 Oy. She hot. 




 Woah dude. Adult Swim teaches me something new every day.  




 I can relate. My thoughts are too interesting for my brain to let me fall asleep. 




 It might be hard to believe, but life will get better. Just remember that you live *now*, not in the future. Just focus on enjoying the moment that you're experiencing right now. Sending you love, brotha. 




 Thank you for sharing... absolutely made my day finding this out. :) 




 You think they're at peace now? Or did the fire anger them and force them to find a new home?.. 




 *Ur all trowls 




 Aw man, I know nothing about motorcycles... but that thing is beautiful! I always thought something like that or maybe an old Honda CB350 would be so much cooler than a big Harley or a Kawasaki. [Mick Jagger, 1971](http://i.imgur.com/TBOUBR7.jpg). 




 You know, this might be an unpopular opinion, but I don't think Interstellar travel will happen. Unless Matthew Mcconaughey sends us a wormhole from the fifth dimension. :( 




 Fantasizing about being a Cuban cocaine kingpin? Guilty! 




 ...What am I looking at? I *kind of* see the one in the window. 




 This was totally snubbed at the Oscars. :( 









 It'll be okay, bud. Remember, you don't live in the future, you live in the present.  




 Oh God yes, yes we do.  




 Yo estoy one with nature, bro. 




 There are a lot of cool pictures from these recording sessions. I think they did a story on it in Rolling Stone magazine. [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/1OLd7D7.png) 









 Oh my god I just tried this and it totally worked. My mind is blown. Kanye West to philosophy. 









 Oh, the feels! 




 Slutdog Millionaire. 




 Why would somebody do this? 




 Very cool extension. Thank you. I am in awe of how passionate you are of this while still not making money from it. 
























 Yee... 




 *we all won the prize of life* 




 Extreme heat in Arizona desert. Tire exploded on a road trip. That sucked. Took a few hours to fix it because we didn't know shit about tires. I thought I was melting.  




 Fat Monica Geller

 What if I was born as Jesus instead of myself 




 ESPECIALLY Black Space. Hear it on the radio every day. My friends think I'm crazy for not liking it. Ya know, I'm fine with Swift. But that one song? Wanna cut off my ducking ears 




 What??? Really?? 




 Disappointment.  




 Be the alpha. 




 Didn't expect to laugh so hard, thank u 




 "So do you wanna see my pet snake?" werks evrytim 




 Humans enjoy playing God.  




 Eyes Wide Shut, the illuminati orgy 




 My first fight was when I was in 4th grade. I was playing in a 5th grade basketball league. Me and this kid on the other team got into a skuffle. After the game, I threw a ball at his head. He threw a box of cereal at mine. My dad escorted me out of the gym and grounded me for a month. I was sad. 




 It's your trademark.

 Do not question batman 




 Aw, that's so tough. He only has a couple albums and I love so many of his songs. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIuBcb2T55Q) might be a good introduction. Guy's a fuckin weirdo. I'd check him out, definitely grows on ya 




 DAE have a personal sayings that they use a lot? Recently, in response to anything mildly peculiar or mindblowing, I've been saying **"That's some Interstellar shit right there."** 




 Haha that's exactly what I thought. 




 Mac Demarco. Good to smoke to... if you're chill, that is.
Much love from Arizona, brotha. 




 I really like some of the creepy overtones your art has. 




 I love the way the waves blend into the clouds. 




 Ay, caramba!

 Them marijuana cigarettes 
























 It's a natural and soothing white noise. It's a calm reminder that the world is functioning without you so you can sleep in peace.  




 Trying to comprehend the mysteries of the universe. That's some tough shit right there and the internet makes it seem like it's such a simple subject. 




 When I was younger, doing the "fire in the hole!" coke throw back at a Wendy's drive thru. The lady was mortified. I've felt guilty about that for years.

 You have great taste in music, my friend 




 The classical music in 2001: A Space Odyssey 




 Ahaha I was caught off guard by this, I'm dying 




 good one 




 If John Lennon wasn't killed, who knows what kind of powerful influence he would have had. I've heard people say that he'd be president or the next Jesus. 




 Oo no no, I'd start a religion. The ultimate religion. Trick people into thinking I'm the Messiah. 




 Make a film. The ultimate film. Decades of work and knowledge into on piece of art. Then release it onto the world, hopefully allowing it to become legendary in a progressing timeline. 




 You. 




 Jesus. "How's it going, man?" 




 Not *all* women are great in bed. 




 Make Kanye the next messiah. 




 Sometimes I have visions of things right before they happen. 




 jerked it in my typing class in middle school 









 I'd take her flower.  




 You know you want it.  




 That's actually interesting.  




 An allegory for drug abuse? 




 This transcends genres 




 I wonder if there's an HD scan of it somewhere.  




 Seriously. I can't believe how well I remember this song. I think I was in kindergarten. So good.  




 Dog town   Z-boys, and 
Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocolypse 




 Join us, Ted.  
























 That's some repugnant shit! 




 Con Yay 




 Yooo I had low expectations for this and I got to On Sight and I'm seriously turning up in my car right now! 

edit: Oh my god, and I've never even *heard* God Level before! This shit bumps! 




 This isn't very good. 




 This! Even in the Lost World, Isla Sorna was totally abandoned. It would be great to see a story of the hurricane hitting the island and seeing shit hit the fan as workers try to get off the island as dinosaurs begin to break loose. I always felt like Isla Sorna was a more ambitious project than the '93 Isla Nublar. I want to see it before it was hit by the storm.  




 Ray Arnold didn't die. He survived, armless, on Isla Nublar.  









 FILMMAKERS 3 




 This is trash, dog 




 This was *by far* his best live performance of this song. He's done this so many times and I think he finally nailed it with this. 




 BLAAAAAAAAAAADES 




 He's portrayed as a dreamer. A revolutionary. Walt Disney. He always had the best intentions. 




 Ahhhhhh, ***this*** is what I've been looking for. Is there a good master of Wolves? 




 meh 




 Notice the bones above the writing. Is that a spine?? 




 I really don't like Stronger. I can't stand that it's one of his most popular songs. I always hear it on the radio and cringe. That is not a song Kanye would make now. And his feature on Katy Perry's E.T...  




 How is your self esteem?  









 I'm trying to find more videos like [this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSCrre45vCE)

It reminds me of some sick fever dream I might have had as a child. I wouldn't mind getting stoned and watching something similar to this. Anybody know of any other videos like this? 




 Oh my GOD! I LISTENED TO THAT SONG SO MANY TIMES IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL!!! 5th grade, 2005, specifically! I really thought it was Weird Al. Me and my buddy used to jam out to this in his shed when we first learned how to use the internet on our own. There was a YTMND and I remember finally finding an mp3 of it and being so happy. My parents didn't like it when I sang it at the dinner table. Haha I'm so happy you made this post. Thank you, catthedd. You had an influence on some young children in Arizona. 




 Am I the only person that feels bad for her? I don't like how police officers are so ruthless. 




 I kind of like it. It's charming. 




 I believe you. I don't necessarily believe they stole your story per se, but I actually know a few people that have also written scripts for Jurassic Park IV that are eerily similar to Jurassic World. I think a lot of people have a lot of the same ideas of what they would want to see in a new JP film. 




 Jesus. 




 "Life...uh...finds a way"  -  Ian Malcolm 




 He's so happy. :') 




 I've never been more depressed from a movie. I hated it. I don't know why anybody would enjoy it. 
























 Damn lucky. I wish something like that was in Phoenix (or literally anywhere in AZ). I checked on ebay and they're going from $90-$800. Anybody know of any other options for someone to get a copy? A past time of mine is to chill and look at look books(I recommend the free Vans look books you can get at the Vans stores). Any clever ideas?? Any high quality scans? High quality printer shops? If somebody reads this and has any ideas where I can get stuff like this, I would love you. 3
thanks fam

edit: I might even want to compile high quality scans of look books for people to DL. Print media is awesome. I want to get my hands on the Odd Future look books too.

 Haa I definitely wasn't expecting that verse. I thought it was sick. So many people talking ish about that already smh 




 Yikes. Sounds like poo still. I am so stoked to hear the CDQ. Please, ye. 




 If the grandparents are cool, why does it matter 




 This is from the leaked Steve McQueen-directed All Day music video. It's like a 9 minute video (all one take) where Kanye is rapping All Day, then he sits down and sings this. He showed off the video in Paris a few weeks ago.

 Does anybody know what photo editing program he is using in some of the other pics he uploaded? Is it just iPhoto? 




 Hehe I like this. New Testament and TMNT 




 Cringe inducing. 




 This should be in /r/cringe

 I think it's cool. 




 Can anybody who has the PM hook it up? Thank you :) 




 Dude, I know I'm a little late but could you *please* PM me you're sending everyone else?

 Haha I really like the Break the Internet one. 




 Thank you for answering. 




 Ahhhhahaha I'm dying!! This brings me back.  




 NOSFERATU 




 It makes me frustrated that there's such an emphasis on the NSFW for language... 




 Why does everyone hate Cruel Summer?? 




 All the decorations in my room. They're all kinda shitty and cheap, but I accumulate a lot of memories over the years. For example, I have a samurai sword that's falling apart. My brother gave it to me when I left to college, and I kept it on display at my dorm. 

I got really stoned once and watched Breakfast at Tiffany's for the first time and I thought it was so cool I immediately went out and bought a big poster of Audrey Hepburn. I moved back home and I still have it above my bed, even though my family gives me strange looks.  




 Happier. 




 MBDTF, Cruel Summer, College Dropout, Yeezus, WTT, 808s, Late Registration, Graduation

i really like cruel summer...

seems like it's pretty clear that everyone thinks MBDTF is a masterpiece. 




 I should be diggin for dino DNA
