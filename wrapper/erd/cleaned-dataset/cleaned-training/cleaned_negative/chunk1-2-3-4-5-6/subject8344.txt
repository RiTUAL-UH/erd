 There is post offering a bitcoins and I am dumbfounded. Some think it's good  and some think it's more of an insult to give a starving family 26 cents.

I do not want this subreddit to be a place where  responses to real problems are answered in pennies. But I admit I am totally ignorant to all of this.

What do all think about this? Please help me. I am clueless to all of this. Does this really offer any real assistance or is it just an insult to those in need? I know every penny counts but we are interested in real solutions, not making people beg for scraps. 

It may be a solution to a small sector of people who are into this but is it really something for the /r/assistance community?

Please give me your opinions and advice.  














 After the McDaniel loss last night, I hear all this talk about how pissed the Tea Party is and how they want to split from the party. But as an outside observer,  I'm find myself confused and really can not tell the difference between the two. They have voted the same in all congressional votes. Basically no no and no and yes on Obamcare repeal.

I mean what is really the difference between the two. I just don't see it. One may talk crazier than the other but they both vote for the exact same things.

What is the actual  difference when it comes to how each of them vote or what they stand for?

 



















 I mean your really honest and candid comments. 









 I can't justify paying $16 a month just for these two shows. Is there another way I can still see them. Doesn't matter if it's later in the week than they appear.

I have never done streaming before.

 I just changed my browser to Chrome and now when I click a link to an image here on reddit the picture is huge. I have to shrink it manually to see what it is.

It's obvious one of my settings somewhere is doing this. Can you tell me what setting I need to change to make these pictures appear a normal size without having to shrink it manually each time? 



















 I have a good friend who is losing his sight. I'm looking to get information about devices that will allow him to still use his computer. Any suggestions on which subreddit to post in? 



















 They seem to have made anything and everything Obama does some sort of act of Satan. To me the question is not if they will, but how they will. 

How long do you think people are going to continue and fall for this obvious smear campaign?

As of now there hasn't been anything. But I'll bet you I can come here two days from now and that will not be the case.

 I want to send out some personal thank yous to folks that contriibuted to the Baes fund raiser. There was a link to click on the first donation that allowed me to do that. Now I can't seem to find it anymore. There are a couple of people I want to thank. How do I do that?

 When I put the key in my 2002 Doge Neon, it just spins and does not lock or unlock the car. I looked at videos online and took off the door panel. The cables going to the lock work perfectly. It's the actual part where you put the key in that isn't working.

I want to get it fixed but fear if I go to the dealer they will way over charge me for a simple job.

How would you smart guys here approach this problem. Or should I say how do you recommend someone like me approach it so I don't get over-charged hundreds of dollars for a simple problem?

 Now that the smoke is clearing, it's pretty evident that the sole issue Dave Brat ran on (immigration) was not much of a factor in this election. Virginians actually support immigration reform by a pretty decent margin. 

So could it be that the candidate that actually won was the "Not-Cantor" candidate? 





























 Being the head mod of r/assistance, I have made it a policy, to make or endorse a request for anyone to avoid any conflict of interest.  But I am making a rare exception because one of our own needs us in the worst way. /u/baes is one of the nicest people I've ever met on reddit.
 
Last year in r/SantasLittleHelpers, I met him and he loved what we were doing and joined in to help in every way he could, even though he was undergoing chemotherapy for the cancer that invaded his life. 

We loved him so much, we made him a moderator in r/assistance and he instantly fit in, continuing the wonderful work he had done during Christmas. But his condition has deteriorated to the point he can barley see the screen anymore. We keep in touch because his wife reads my messages and helps him compose the ones back to me. 

It really saddens me how such a good guy is having to go through so much. And to make it worse, he and his family now face considerable financial troubles. I could go into them but lets just say they need our help in the worst way.

 Trying figure out if someone deleted their account. Will their name still show up on their old posts and comments or will it say **"deleted"** under the part where it says who made the post or comment?

If they had been banned by the administrators, wouldn't their posts show up in light pink? I know the newer ones will but I'm not sure about the old ones.

 




 It seems like the gay marriage ban is being struck down in one state after another. There is now a pending case in every single state that has a gay marriage ban. Should this trend continue and it eventually goes to the Supreme Court, how do you think the nation would react if they nullified every decision made by federal judge after judge in  making it clear the ban is unconstitutional? Of course it would be the usual 5-4 decision.

 Currently a user can initiate a modmail thread that all mods see and can participate in. 

But a mod can only initiate a thread other mods can see. We don't have the ability to include another user in that conversation. 

My reasoning behind this is when we have issues with a user, the mod has to send a personal message to them that only he and the user  see. It would be much more useful for all the mods to see and participate in it. That way all mods know what is going and can offer their input as well. 

It would really help keep the mod team on the same page and for the user to not be singled out by one mod.

I know it can be done. It is exactly what happens when you ban a user. A message is sent from whoever banned the user to the user and to modmail that all the mods and the user can see and participate in.

I think this would help both the mods and the user. Everyone wins.

Thank you considering it. :D 




 I want to ask the administrators to add a tool that would help us. Basically a way we can send a mod message to a user that would start a mod thread all the mods could see.

Just like when you ban a user, that thread appears under the mod that sent it, but all the mods can see it and participate in it.

This way when we have an issue we need to communicate to a user, all the mods will see it and can participate in it. Current we can only do that when the user initiates the thread.  




 When you ban a user, it starts a mod thread that all the mods can see and also the person you banned. You have a mod thread with the user and the mods.

Is there a way to initiate that type of thread from a mod so all the mods will be in on something when we send messages to a user?

 I run /r/assistance and currently it is allowing users to submit linked posts. It never used to allow that. It is important to us that only text posts be allowed.

I have the box checked under subreddit settings to **text posts only.**

Yet it still gives users the option to make a linked post. We've been text post only for a long time now. I don't know how or why it is behaving this way.

Any guesses?

Looks like timotab figured it out. It's only letting the mods do it. Thanks timotab! 









 I just want to know what I can site as reddit's readership. So about how many subscribers and maybe an estimate of their total readership. 




 I'm wondering if it's just me. I actually still have the little cog wheel button to change my settings, but all of the RES features have disappeared.

 I did this room addition last year for my brother's boss. It took several months and I developed a very special bond with their dog. I just heard they had to put him to sleep. I'm not super close to these folks but my brother told me his bosses' wife told him to make sure he let me know. I thought I would send something like flowers but I wasn't sure that would be appropriate. What do you think? Have any other ideas? 












































 I run /r/Assistance and I have a user that needs to communicate with someone right now because they are helping him with an urgent problem.

He made the post with a throwaway account but I have his other account too that he hasn't used for over a year. But now it says he has to wait five hours to sign in to either account. I've never heard of anything like this. Is there a reason they do this and is there anything I can do to help him get around this? 

















































 I've talked with so many other people and no one but U-Verse subscribers in Anaheim (Fullerton) are being deprived of the game. This is the first time in LA sports history that two local teams are meeting head-to-head in a playoff and the most devoted fans are the only ones who don't get to see it. 

And the only reason is we made the mistake of having U-Verse. ATT has really screwed us big time. I've called them and can't even get an explanation. They say it's because it's on a local channel which is a lie. It was during the regular season but not for the playoffs.

And it's not like there should be some contract dispute that doesn't allow it. DISH, Direct, Time Warner and everyone else but U-verse people get it.



-------------------------------

**EDIT:**

After spending two days on the phone being given every excuse in the world and finally being told it is just blacked for me, and there were no options for me to get it..., for some reason I am now getting it. I think I was more frustrated by them not being able to give me a valid reason and telling me lie after after lie. But I am watching the game right now.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykpjFjsEdl4 









 The series of the year is being blacked out on my TV (Fullerton, CA) and ATT says it's because they have not negotiated a contract with NBCSN. I think they are BSing me because I still get the channel but it blacks out just during the Kings/Duck game. I near yo folks in Los Angeles are getting it but we in Orange County do not? That does not make sense.

My question to you out there in LA, are you getting the games? And what city do you live in? I am hassling with them right now and need to know whether or not I am going to quit my service.

 The Kings/Ducks hockey games have been blacked out for my area. (Orange County, California) - Not only that, they blacked out the end of the games before that so I wasted hours watching it only to have the last 30 minutes of the game blacked out. They are not blacking them out on Direct TV or Dish from what I hear. They are just being dick heads.

 

What in the heck is going on? This is ridiculous. This is the first time in history two LA sports teams are meeting each other in a playoff and we in the local area don't get to see it. Seriously I am really frustrated about this.

 I have ATT U-Verse and the game is supposed to be on NBCSN. But the channel is black right now. Are they actually blacking out a sold out game for us? If so, does anyone know where I can watch it on the computer? 




 Seriously, men go nuts and want to kick the shit out some guy messing around with his girlfriend. But more times than not, it is the girlfriend who is responsible for the cheating.

 I remember this song from long ago. When I google it all I get is a bunch of violent rap songs. This song is nothing like that. I think it's an acoustical guitar piece by a pretty famous artist from the 70s or 80s. And the song is not violent at all. 

The lyrics may be "turn on the news o see who's shooting who" or "tune in the news to see who's shooting who." 






















































 All of a sudden it takes a couple seconds for the keystrokes and mouse clicks to show up on the screen after I enter them.  I have done malware and virus scans. No help there. I have defragemented, and I still have all kinds of space left on my computer. It also doesn't register anything after I get six or seven characters ahead. So I have to type five ore six letters and then sit and wait for it to catch up. And even then some of the words I typed aren't there.

 The pipe broke and left the inch or so that inserts into the female part of the main sewer pipe. It's flush with the the female sleeve. Here is the generic photo of the connection:

http://cloudfront.zorotools.com/product/full/1CNT9_AS01.JPG

It is a 4" to 2"

I would like to fix this without having to replace the piece above. I just need to get that one or two inch piece out of that fitting so I can put a new pipe in there. Someone  told me to chip it out with a screwdriver but I am afraid I will break the female part in the process.

Another person said there might be some kind of drill bit that looks like a spade that I can use to drill it out. I have no idea what it is called or if it even exists.

At this point I'm not sure how to proceed. I was hoping for some suggestions on how to chip or drill it out with more ease and without breaking the female part of the fitting. Or any other methods you might have up your sleeve.


----------------------------

**EDIT**

Off the advice of a redditor, I used a rubber tee with a clamp and it fit over the female part of the coupling.

It looked like this:

I had given the wrong size in my post but was still able to find a fitting that worked. It ended up being the 2" opening off of a 3 X 2 tee. But all that matters is it worked. Once again washing clothes without flooding the underneath of my house.

Thank goodness for reddit. :D

 Title says it all - Please **VOTE!!!** 





























 I recently read this quote from our president:

 A few timid people who fear progress, will try to give you new and strange names for what we are doing. Sometimes they will call it fascism; sometimes communism; and sometimes socialism. 




 But in so doing, they are trying to make very complex, something that is really very simple, and very practical. 


--------------

And I read what they say about him:


* People everywhere are growing impatient.  On the right  organized by some of the most powerful industrialists charging that the presidents actions are only making things worse.

  That the president has become a dictator, defying the constitution, encouraging class warfare. Saying the president is hell-bent on socialism. There can only be one capital, they say; Washington or Moscow. There can only be one flag. The stars and stripes, or the flag of the godless Soviets. His enemies only referred to him as that man in the White House. Because they cannot bear to say his name. 

  On the left socialist and some communist took to the street denouncing the president as a captive of capitalism; incapable of bringing about real change.

---------------------

Hearing this makes me wonder what they will say about Obama in the history books in the years to come.

What are your thoughts about what they say now and do you believe he will be remembered differently or just like what the say now? I mean has any other president been so hated at the time, ever end up being considered a great president after all the smoke clears or is Obama stuck with the hatred forever? 



















 I have been negligent in sending out thanks for all the support and cards you have sent me and my 92 year old mom. She laughs and smiles when I bring her the cards. It has been rough but all of you have made things more bearable.

It's amazing how the support comes from every corner of the world. I just can not express my appreciation in this challenging time.

She is still in the care facility and her mental capacity has returned. But physically she is still extremely weak. We are hopeful that she will keep getting stronger and eventually may be able to bring her home.

Your support means everything to both me and her. 

Thank you. Thank you so much.

 The time has come and in this last crucial week /r/democrats will be dedicated solely to election issues and getting out the vote.

The only reason democrats lose in the midterms is because of voter turnout.

 We have one of your countrymen starving out there and we want to get this guy a pizza. I live in the US and could not find a way to order and pay for one.

http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/2i7xwv/havent_eaten_since_monday/

I promise I will reimburse you. And I never break a promise.  














 I'm late at sending out thanks to you all. Mom got really sick and has been in the hospital this last week. Up until today it did not look good. Her mental state was gone. I was fearing the worst.

But today when I visited her, she was back. She was asking questions and  her mind was obviously back. I brought the cards you sent for her birthday that are still coming in and she loved them. From Germany, New Zealand, cities throughout the US, Australia and so many other places. She was reading them and smiling. Medicine that could not have come from anywhere else and it was working great.

Thank you all for keeping my mom happy and alive. Say some prayers that her recovery continues. Bless you all! :D

 Today I went to my sister's house for my mom's birthday. I kind of hate going to stuff like that because I always have to hear all that right-wing extremist crap. I mean they make FOX News look liberal. Especially my evil brother. The ignorance that comes out of his mouth is excruciating. I gave up long ago trying discuss anything with him.

So they are going on and on about the football player that beat his wife and the black guy that got killed in Ferguson and somehow made it about how unfair they were being to white people. How they got there I will never know. I was just biting my tongue but finally mentioned Zimmerman. The conversation went on without my participation but it was just so vile and ignorant. Talking about how unfair Zimmerman was treated and what a piece of shit the kid that got killed was. And how the black guy that got killed in Ferguson ruined that cops's life.
After several minutes of listening to this garbage, I finally just stood up and said:

"Yea..., those fucking niggers!"

Everyone just went silent and gasped. Even though for the last 20 minutes, that's what they had been basically saying. They thought it was horrible how I paraphrased it for them. They were not happy with me today. But I was giggling to myself how I actually out-extremed the extremists. 














 You may have noticed I have been pretty absent  here the last couple weeks. It's because I have the flu. And this thing just doesn't seem to want to go away.

Please by all that is holy - 

**GO GET YOUR FLU SHOT!!!**

This thing is the worst.

Here is a government site that will give you locations to get yours:

* http://www.vaccines.gov/getting/where/


Please don't wait. This thing sucks. I'll see ya again soon when I get well. God forbid you get this damn thing. 




 Hearing that Scotland is voting to leave the UK is kind of surprising to some of us less UK-knowledgeable Americans. Could you give us the basics of who and what makes up the UK? 




 Some races are very close and upsets are very possible if we join together and just vote. But to do so, you need to register and do it soon.

**PLEASE REGISTER NOW!**

I will gladly find out how and where you can register in your state if you just tell me your city and state. 

**And please vote in November.** 



















 I've had it with ATT. Not because of the price or any other service. But because they continually manipulate and lies to me. Each month for the last six months I had to make that dreaded call to ask why my bill went up $20.  I would win the argument but then they would do it again the next month. 

Anyway, I need a new internet and TV service. Who should I get? 









 A really nice redditor provided us with this link on how to add an address to your Amazon wishlist. It was soooooo helpful. It saved the mods so many headaches trying to explain to people how to do that. They made it in pictures that was so simple anyone could understand it. Check it out:

* https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B37BFyksMPvcNUpNeW9VT0N2TGc/edit

What we really could use is the same thing that explains how to make an Amazon wishlist from scratch. It would be aimned at people who are not good at computers and have never made an Amazon wishlist before. Come Christmas we are running both subs and it is an insane amount of work for us. Explaining the wishlist consumes way too much of our time. The format with the pictures like the one above would be most preferred. 

Is there anyone who would be willing to make this for us? 

P.S. Christmas is closer than you think. :D 




 I promised to buy a needy Canadian some coffee. But every frickin' place I try to order it from will not send it to Canada  from the US. It doesn't have to come from the US. It can be sent from Canada to Canada. I just have to pay for it from the US.

Not looking for anything fancy. Just some plain old regular coffee. I've been trying for hours with no success. It's such a simple thing but is turning into a major hassle. Can you give me an online site that will allow me to send this poor woman some coffee?

----------------------

**EDIT:**

**Thank you all for your help. I finally found a place to do it. :D** 




 I run /r/santaslittlehelpers where we require requests to include am Amazon wishlist. We spend so much of our time coaching people in how to make a wishlist. Some of these users can barely send an email. It is so frustrating and time consuming for us.

We of course had the problem of them not adding their shipping address until a very kind redditor gave us this link to show them how:

*https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B37BFyksMPvcNUpNeW9VT0N2TGc/edit

It really helped out. Now we are looking for the same kind of thing that explains with pictures, how to make a basic wishlist.

Is there one in existence or would someone be willing to make one for us? 

Our subscribers last year provided over $20,000 of gifts from Amazon to those in need so you could see how frustrating it gets instructing so many to make a basic wishlist. To have a link we could give them that would explain it in the simplest of terms, with pictures like the link above, would be awesome beyond awesome.

Anyone out there know of one or would be willing to create one? 





























 I'm curious if people of reddit would consider this as an abuse of presidential powers. So many of you questioned  whether the president can legally authorize the killing of a U.S. citizen fighting for a foreign terrorist group in the past.

If so, what would make this case different than the other ones he targeted. If not, do you think he should be powerless if he can't get at him to bring back to America for trial? 












































 Yes. In fact your votes are the only ones that matter.
Elections are not decided by republicans or democrats. Their votes basically cancel each other out. They sway from one side back and forth, but rarely are the deciding factor.

In most presidential elections, the percentage difference is around 5%. If all the people who say their vote doesn't matter would vote, then they would matter. They would easily sway the vote one way or the other. The direction our country takes can easily be changed by a small percentage that does not vote. The very people who say their vote does not count.

**In practical reality, your votes are the only ones that do count.** 














 Last year saw the launch of our sister-sub, /r/SantaLittleHelpers. It was a smashing success and you awesome people made the difference for so. so many people.

We are currently working behind the scenes to not only supply Christmas for thousands, but to have the time of our lives doing it.

**We need your ideas for events, contests and just fun things to do over the six weeks we will be operating.**

Myself and others will be donating prizes for contests but we are looking for fun ways that keep us all in the spirit of Christmas. Please be creative. Of course we want to bring Christmas to those that who otherwise wouldn't have it. But we want to have fun while doing it. Looking forward to hearing your ideas.


------------------------------


Oh and by-the-way, here is our video from last year, in case you missed it.

 Hi,

I'm train_subject8344 of r/assistance. Each Christmas we provide tens of thousands of dollars worth of toys and presents to redditors around the world in our sister subreddit: /r/SantasLittleHeplers.

Right now the place looks like it was designed by a serial killer. I mean it is terrible. We want it to scream Christmas. Right now the only thing it screams is I don't have a clue how to of how to make a site look like Christmas.

We seriously want it to make it look like Santa had an acid trip there. So we are looking for someone to decorate the place up for us. Here is a real chance to show your creativity and help us bring Christmas joy to the world. Anyone feel like taking up the challenge?

 Some anonymous wonderful person just gave me a years worth of gold. You are a sweetheart and I thank you from the bottom of my heart. Whoever you are. :D

**Edit: I knew it was you /u/helen73 - You are a most awesome person. Thank you for the gold and more for the kind words. You help me realize how wonderful of a place this is. :D** 
























 My eye sight sucks and I need an illuminated keyboard that is easy to read. The one I got before totally sucks because the keys are too close together and I am constantly accidentally hitting caps locks. And the shift key is sticky as hell. I absolutely hate it. 

So I am breaking down and getting a new one. I am not a gamer. Just an average smuck on a computer. Would love a recommendation for a medium priced keyboard to make this old man a little less grumpy. 




 My eye sight sucks and I need an illuminated keyboard that is easy to read. The one I got before totally sucks because the keys are too close together and I am constantly accidentally hitting caps locks. I hate it. And I don't want that piece of crap that they advertise on TV for 99 year olds.

Let me know if I should be posting this elsewhere.

Thanks.

 Something real slow and that uses simple chords. But real pretty when sung solo by a male? An old classic is preferable but not required.

It would be a toward the end song. You know when everyone is tired and ready to call it a night.

Almost like a lullaby type slow.

---------------------

Totally awesome suggestions. Keep 'em coming itf you would. Some of these may not be the ending lullabye but some that I will still want to work in.

But this is the song I think I'm going to go with. Tell me if you agree:

 I can think of no better way to allow legislation that the people want than to have votes on issues in a proposition style election like the states have. I imagine we would have to change the constitution to allow it but doesn't it make sense?
I've just never heard anyone suggest it before. 
























 This our true friend and a couple of the nurses won't let anyone visit here. She'll be gone in few days and it won't make any difference. Shouldn't she be allowed to be comforted by her friends in her last days?

 People need to tag their posts in our subreddit. It is a quite simple task:

* http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/29ifmv/how_to_add_a_tag/

But the option to add a tag isn't showing up for some all of a sudden. It's worked perfectly fine in the past. They just click that option pictured here:


* http://i.imgur.com/UO28rZh.jpg


But some say it isn't  showing up for them. We've not had this problem in over a year of using it. Any speculation on what has caused the problem? Is it maybe it's just a temporary glitch? 




 It seems people are having trouble adding a tag.

Just click the add tag option under your post you just made:

* http://imgur.com/UO28rZh

Click on the proper tag (or type one yourself) and press **save**

That's it. It's two clicks and **save**


-----------------


**Let me know if you still have a problem or the option to tag the post does not appear.**


 









 Something clever. It's at a protest rally at republican's office. 

**EDIT:** Maybe I should say we are protesting the congress' inaction on immigration reform 




 We are protesting congress' inaction on immigration at Ed Royce's (R) office. I need a clever protest sign. Help me please. 




 I'm supposed to be getting all these movies to choose from. Everything I search for costs money. The box is always orange with a price in it. They are supposed to be green and say instant watch. Am I in the wrong place. I am signed in and my Amazon Prime membership is active, but I can't find any free movies. 
























 I know you can give and turn off certain things your moderators are allowed to do. Here are the categories of choices I have:

* access

* config

* flair

* mail

* posts

* wiki

Will turning off one of these prevent them from banning people? And whichever one it is, will it prevent fro doing other things as well? I only want to them to not be able to ban. 









 My 92 year old mom became very ill a few months ago. She did not eat for a month and didn't even recognize me much of the time. My family and I had pretty much figured it was only a matter of time. 

Figuring it was her last Christmas, I asked you all to card bomb her:




* http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsofCards/comments/2p172o/request_may_i_ask_a_huge_favor_from_everyone/

You did not disappoint. Slowly I saw improvement in her as I brought new cards in every time I visited. She loved them. She showed them off to others. Soon she began reading them herself. I saw the mom I once had, slowly regaining strength, eating, carrying on a conversation and she finally stopped calling me Pete (my name is Wayne).

But the incredible thing I saw today is she walked about six feet. It may not sound like much, but for me it is a miraculous. 

I know I asked you all just to make one last Christmas special for a very special lady. But you may have actually given her another Christmas as well.  You have provided her a will to live and to reason to fight. I wish I could send you all a personal thank you but there were just too many cards. But know together you did something I had given up on. 

Thank you all and may you actually get the opportunity to send more cards next Christmas. :D

train_subject8344

P.S. Whoever sent the dancing polar bear card and the snowman with the shaking butt card, you really have provided more laughter and happiness than you could have ever expected. She still shows them to me when I visit.

 I run /r/Assistance    and you guys have helped us sooooo much. Yes_it_is_weird has really done some great work for us. I know he is busy so I didn't want to bug him again.

People request help in our subreddit and we want our subscribers to be aware of when a request is being made by a new user so they can use extra caution.

So we are looking for a bot the reads the age of the OP's account and gives it a special flair if it is a newer account. We would of course want that flair to disappear after a certain amount of time. 

Is this a possibility and is there anyone that might help us implement this?
 




 Still looking for more pics - We just love them here. :D 




 It been a great year thanks to the many awesome people here. Thank you for all your kindness and letting us be a part of your community. :D

 My mom was barely conscious when I asked for cards to be sent to her. You guys sent over 250 cards to her and she responded in an awesome way. She can carry on a conversation and she is eating again. There is actually hope now. She is still very weak but she is now talking and even reading your cards. Words can not express my gratitude.

Thank soooooooooooooooooooooo much everyone.

 This year we helped over 700 families and had a good time doing it. This is what Christmas is all about. Thank you to everyone that made it possible. Each and everyone one of you should be very proud.

We will make a video and it release early next year. And we will be back again next year and it will be bigger and better ever.

All my wishes for a happy and awesome new year.

 Deleting requests is a bannable offense. 

Sorry to sound harsh. We have just had a rash of this tactic being used lately. We try to be nice and give out warnings. We do not like to be dicks. But there are a few who are abusing that.

If there is a special reason you want it removed, contact the mods and they will do it for you. Then there is no suspicion or no problem. 

Sorry to sound like a hothead. We just don't want any of your generosity to be taken advantage of.  









 This is a real special moderator of the day. /u/Fwogzilla has done such awesome work and has helped so may. This guy is a hero among heroes. 

Please give all the love you can mustard to today's Moderator Of The Day:

 I'm facing all sorts of adversity right now. Whether it is health, being able to afford to live, being able to work, and just being able to live for another day. It is all happening at once. Without a family to run to and without any remote friends that can lend a hand in the way I need, I am facing extreme calamity. Possibly death.


Everything that I'm going through is because of a mystery illness that I was faced with a couple years ago. It's gone to far to the extent where I really need help, especially since a recent accident that happened a couple months ago. I can't walk. If I must, I have to wear leg braces. I can't walk because of my arthritic and ligament problems, which was caused by the illness that spread throughout my entire body to cause all of these things. It doesn't help that I was training and working out a lot during my time in the Marine Corps. It's caused me constant bleeding throughout these past couple of years. Lately, and for the first time this year I have lost feeling in both of my feet and legs. It's starting to spread upwards on my leg. I've fainted numerous of times just from being too sick. I've found myself passed out in the bathroom floor or in the hallway. I've fainted in the hands of professions in the hospital, as well. I've had to deal with tons of research done to me. Seen tons of medical professionals. None have been able to really help me or conclude what possibly happened to me. I haven't gave up despite all of my problems.


I'm ultimately needing 20K for treatments. I'm living in an apartment without any bed (I've been sleeping on the floor) and my tent has been due ($1,445 for November and December). I'm about to get an eviction notice. My apartment complex wants to kill me. It is winter time. I'm on my last $30. To say that I just need $20K for treatments wouldn't be enough. My treatments can take 1 and half to 2 months total. This is from a doctor that I know can make me better. I'm really ashamed and feel like I'm asking for too much already. But, I already exhausted all the possible resources I can and whatever anyone can give me as advice. I can immediately start working after this and finish my schooling. 

* www.gofundme.com/gilvx4


I'm the review of what I ultimately ask, please consider my statements hereforth.

Does someone chose to get sick? Or is it someone else's fault to get sick? I have been blamed for both. I feel at fault and at my wits end. I feel like I have asked from the VA (Veterans Affairs), to the government, to my friends (and "friends") and to my connections to no avail. I am at your full mercy to pick me up. To give me a chance, again. Not to run and to sloth at this given opportunity, but given a chance to make a difference. A difference that I know I can do and promise. To give back.

If you need any proof, questions, or concerns, please let me know.

 Backpackwayne's mom has really gone down hill in the last couple months. I have had to face reality and accept that I will lose my mother soon.




The last couple months I've watched my mom, who is the epitome of kindness, waste away to what look to be her final days. She didn't eat anything for the last month.



But this last week I bought a new TV for her hospital room just to give her some kind of stimulus. I never dreamed it would spark her will to live like it did. She has started to eat again and can once again carry on a limited conversation.

Well I thought if something like a TV could do that much good, Just think what would happen if we flooded her with hundreds of cards from arounf the world. Even if it didn't have that effect, it would be wonderful that in her final days she knew  that the world was still thinking of her.

**Please, everyone send her a card.**

She likes cards with cute babies and kids and loves the funny stuff too. She is no prude. So feel free to send risque stuff too. Just make her smile.

If there was ever something you could do for me, this would it. I want my mom's final days to as happy as I can make them.

Please PM for the address.

Thank you everyone 

And spread the word elsewhere if you can. I want to shower her with all the cards and love I can.


-------------------

Thank you everyone. Over 250 cards and it has really brightened up my mom. She is actually carrying on a conversation. She just loves it. Words can not express my appreciation. Bless you everyone.

 /r/SantasLittleHelpers grants Christmas wishes to redditors around the world. We are a little short on givers right now. To attract them I bought an **Emerson 32"  TV** to give away in a raffle. Every gift someone gives, they get a ticket for the raffle.

We really need to spread the word about this.

**I'm asking if any of you would allow me to make a post in your subreddit.**

Here is the post:

 If you have been following the story, Pegoeg182 daughter Bailey has been in and out of the hospital with pneumonia. She has been there all day today with her and told me she could use a laugh.

Well let's all see what we can do. Post the funniest stuff you got.  



















 **/u/Automateallthethings**  is SantasLittleHelpers **Moderator of the Day!**


Please join me in thanking him for all his incredibly awesome work. He designed and developed this entire page. He is the reason we not only are festive, but look it as well.

Here is the a picture we took of him at our last company picnic

 Many of you know our sister sub only open during the Christmas season:

/r/SantasLittleHelpers 


We bring Christmas to children of **ALL** ages. We have daily contests for everyone, we share recipes, tell jokes and share stories. And most important, we bring Christmas to hundreds of families that would normally not have one. 

And now we are having our biggest contest yet, open only to the givers of the subreddit in our first annual Givers Appreciation Sweepstakes.

* **[Here is how you can win a 32" color TV and help a deserving family at the same time]
(http://www.reddit.com/r/SantasLittleHelpers/comments/2o4dp7/announcing_santaslittlehelpers_giver_appreciation/)**

Please come over and give a small gift to any of these families. 

**We are short on Santas this year. We really need your help.**

***PLEASE SPREAD THE WORD!!!***
 














 The folks here that give make the success of this subreddit possible, so we have designed a sweepstakes exclusively for them. For every gift given, you are automatically entered in the sweepstakes. You must report the gift here:

* https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1NAmMSMtNtmc8S1e6MYF3CjNTHYWPFnCAg9XZXL4zCGM/viewform

**GRAND PRIZE IS:**

**[32" Emerson LED Flat Screen Color TV](http://www.amazon.com/Emerson-720p-60Hz-HDTV-LF320EM4/dp/B00FFJ33N2)**

We hope to be adding additional prizes as well. 

* If you have  reported a gift you have given, you are already entered. Every time you give, you get an additional raffle ticket. 

We just feel that you too should share in the fun for all you do. After all, it is your kindness and generous nature, that makes this sub what it is.

* For those of you new to our wonderful community, just go to any of the **blue shaded posts** and you will find people that need your help this Christmas. Pick an item off their wish list and help make someone's Christmas what it was meant to be. Or make an offer of a gift. Then report the gift to the link above each time and you will be eligible to win.


And please spread the word. We have lots of people who need help this Christmas. A simple toy  toy can make the difference. :D

**Thank You all and best wishes for great holiday season. :D** 
























 Making a request here that leads to another subredit is not allowed.

Mainly what we are saying is you can not make a **request** post here and have it lead over RandomActsOfChristmas. Your can make separate posts in both subreddits. Thanks for your cooperation. 







































 We have lots of contests going on here at SantasLittleHelpers and will be adding more ever day. There is a button on the sidebar that lists them so you be sure to enter them all. 

Good Luck. :D

 I bought this Fruit Bouquet Cutter set for someone here and it was delivered to my house by mistake. I can't seem to find out who it was supposed to go to. 

Please tell me if this was on your wishlist so I can get it to you.


http://www.amazon.com/MSC-Flower-Power-Cutter-28444/dp/B00CPNUY7Y/ref=sr_1_22?ie=UTF8 qid=1416966275 sr=8-22 keywords=fruit+bouquet


----------------------------

**Edit:** My Mistake!!! CutieJudy had sent them to me as a present. It all makes sense now because she knows what a fruit I am. 





























 We ask you  to report all gifts given with an approximate value and to who it was given. This helps us make sure no one is being taken advantage of and identifies the folks not getting help.

You can report them anonymously if you like. And you don't have to be all that specific. Mainly who it was given to and an approximate value.

Report the gifts here:

 I am trying to help someone get a job. And their resume did not look good to me. I am looking for someone to redo it to look much more professional. I will pay a reasonable amount.

 A Colorado program  deemed the most successful in the country which provided birth control for teens, reduced teen pregnancy by 40%. It also reduced abortions by 35%. Republicans just voted to defund that program.


I just don't get it. I respect your right to have an opinion. But these two positions seem so counter-productive to each other. You hate abortion so much, how can you be against something that reduces it so significantly?

 I am a single 57 year old male and am thinking I should get some life insurance. Nothing extravagant. Do you have any recommendations? 


Additional information: I don;t really understand what type and how much I should get. To be honest, I'm not even sure why I need to get it. It just seems like something I should have. I make a modest income and can't afford to pay a huge amount. But if it is something I should have, I am willing to put some money toward it each month. Sorry for my lack of knowledge on this subject. Your expertise is what I am seeking.

 When big disasters occur, we all care and want to help if we can. But we here at /r/assistance have noticed a rash of gofundme-type fundraiser pop up when these disasters occur. There is no way we can assure the money raised from these, actually go to the cause.

Therefore we will only allow requests where the money goes directly to the relief efforts.  This rule goes into effect immediately.

 After some 40 years of smoking, I have come to use cigarettes as kind of a reward system that gets me through my work day and home life. 

Finish this and I can go have a cigarette, do 30 more of these and I can go have a cigarette, get through 30 more minutes of this and I can go have a cigarette, etc. etc. etc.

When I attempt my quit, I know this will be a **MAJOR** issue for me. I could use some food but we all know what that will lead to. I don't want to gain a lot of weight. 

I need some others rewards to pacify and motivate me to get through my day. Any suggestions?

 Today I watched the "Succubus" episode for about the tree hundred and fiddy time.  But I noticed something I had never noticed before. Do you know what character in that episode turned out to be the Loch Ness Monster?

--------------

Edit: Eric's optometrist is the Loch Ness Monster. The entire episode they make Chef's dad out as some looney who imagines everyone disguised as the Loch Ness monster asking for tree fiddy. But in the very last scene we find out that he wasn't imagining it. Watch the episode again and you will see. Eric's optometrist is the Loch Ness Monster.
Here is the script from the episode. Look at the last line. The optometrist asks Eric for three fifty.

 	Two types of nuclear weapons material: Uranium, which is mined. And Plutonium, which produced.

	Uranium needs to be about 90% pure to work in a nuclear weapon and only 5% for a power plant

	They have been enriching it to 20% - The agreement is that will stop  and they will only enrich it past 3.67% for 15 years

	They currently have 2200 pounds of the 20% enriched. They have agreed to give up 97% they already have.

	It is enriched by centrifuges.  There are two types. 

	One is designed in the 70s which runs on very old outdate software comparable to an Atari game.

	The other is a high tech version that is much faster   efficiently  Iran has none and will not be allowed to have any of these.

	Iran currently has 19,000 of the old inefficient type.

	The deal specifies this number be reduced to 6,000. And only the old and inefficient ones

	Iran would be allowed to conduct research and development on advanced centrifuges. But not produced or possess them.

	 Two ways to make plutonium: 

	Spent fuel rods used in enriching uranium can be used to make plutonium. Iran does not have this reprocessing ability. The deal specifies they cannot seek to gain this knowledge or ability and bans such processing plants.

	The second way is a reactor that is specifically designed to produce it. Iran currently has one such reactor that is not yet operational. 

	The deal specifies this core from this facility be  destroyed or removed from the country 

	Anything produced from this facility is required to be shipped out of the country.

	The other underground facility would partly converted to advanced nuclear research and the production of medical isotopes. About two thirds of its centrifuges would be removed. Foreign scientists would be present. It would have no fissile material that could be used to make a bomb.

	This was one of Israels biggest concerns 

	Unprecedented levels of inspections including on site inspectors, camera and Seals. Uranium is tracked from the time it comes out of the ground, through the processing until it is stored in cylinders. Ability to see what they are importing and exporting. Inventory control.

	Inspections anywhere in the country that could investigate suspicious sites or allegations of a covert enrichment facility. (details still be worked out)

	The issue of when the sanctions are to be removed still looms as one of the potential obstacles to a final agreement on June 30.

	UN Security Council resolutions on Irans nuclear program will be lifted simultaneously. A transparent procurement channel will be established, allowing Iran to get what it needs for civilian nuclear development while giving assurances to the world that the materials will not be diverted for non-peaceful use.

	 International cooperation to help Iran in research and development.

 So that our subscribers will have the benefit of your wisdom and knowledge at their fingertips, We here at /r/assistance have decide to compile list of resources in one handy place to put on our sidebar.

So each week we will ask you to share all your resources for one specific area.

This week it is:

We have many posts for the critters that can make our life worthwhile. 

We ask that you include the following:

* **Name of the organization**

* **A link to the site**

* **The specific area it serves** (city, county, state or country)

   We'd like to get resources around the world

* **The service it provides**

Please be concise so we can put these resources in a neat and easily accessible form. Please follow us in the coming weeks as we ask for resources in other areas that are needed on a regular basis. Next week it will be for the HOMELESS. 

Let's make this the most thorough list we can. Thanks for all your help

-------------------

**Edit: Please write it in this format to make it easier to compile and list later:**


* Name of Organization 

* Link to the site

* Service provide

* Area served

This will make it much easier for me to list when I do the compilation.

 Getting older changes a guy, President Barack Obama says, and he admits he's getting crankier.

"Next week I'm signing an executive order to get off my lawn," Obama joked Saturday night at the Gridiron Club and Foundation's annual dinner. On top of that, the nation's graying chief executive says he's having trouble now with his morning cup of joe. "Coffee really disagrees with me these days," he says, "which is why John Boehner just invited coffee to address the joint House." 
























 I bought it an HTC 150 Smartphone at a cricket store. I'm good at the computer but I am having a hard time learning how to use this phone. Everyone keeps telling just keep trying, you will get it. Well I am not.

I would like to take a class to help me with it. Does anyone know of any such classes near Fullerton, CA? Or maybe a good online tutorial. Something that teaches you like you are five years old.

 AT T has pissed me off for the last time. I could go for paragraphs about how they keep raising my prices. I just want a place that I make a deal and they stick with it. I hate having to call and argue every four or five months.

I checked out Verizon, and they seem to have a decent deal but I fear all the same BS tactics of AT T. Are my fears justified. 

Do they have good service? Do they stick with their contract? Do they play games?

Would appreciate your opinions.

 I'm a long time cigarette smoker trying to talk myself into quitting using e-cigs. I was wondering, compared to regular cigarettes, How harmful are the e-cigs to your health? 

Let's say that on a scale of 1 - 10, regular cigarettes are a ten. What number would e-cigs rate?

   














 I remember someone making a post about it but for the life of me, I do not remember who it was.

But I want to let you know it was delicious!


Thank you so much. :D

 Happy Birthday Sue - We couldn't do this without you.

**WE LOVE YA!**



http://www.troll.me/images/pissed-off-obama/you-happy-birthday-playa.jpg 




 You may notice our **New User Registered** flair featured in red. This means the request is being made by an account younger than 60 days old.  We strongly suggest you take extra precautions and try to find ways to apply help more directly rather than sending cash.

We hope this tool will assist you in making more informed decisions. 


----------------------

**Other tips and tools to promote safe giving:**


* **APPLY ASSISTANCE DIRECTLY WHEN POSSIBLE!!!**  We highly recommend you pay the bill or buy the item instead of sending the money to the OP - This assures  money is going where they say it is** (EX: If someone is asking for help with a utility bill, pay that bill rather than giving the OP money)



* **ASK LOTS OF QUESTIONS IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING GIVING** - Dont be reluctant to ask  OP personal questions by PM - You wouldn't give a perfect stranger  help without  asking them a few questions - If the OP is reluctant to supply the information  by PM,  we recommend you do not give - It is up to the OP to supply you with the comfort and proof you desire and require - Get this information **BEFORE** you give!!!

* **This does not give anyone the right to  harass someone or subject them to a public trial:** - Be polite and respectful and do not make unfounded accusations. You do **not** have the right to put someone on trial - If you have concerns, contact the mods and be prepared to present proof

* **USE COMMON SENSE:** Take a moment to gather information about the requester. - Look at their overview page and history -  Gather any information  needed to pursue someone if they do not live up to their end of the bargain before you supply  assistance - Once you have given, you will not have that opportunity


----------------

**EDIT:**

* * As pointed out bt our moderator u/rhubey,  if you help someone by paying a bill for them, talk to someone from the billing department or customer service to make sure they do not keep your card information on file as the default payment card. This will avoid your card ever being used again by accident or even on purpose. Thanks you rhubey for this excellent advice. 









 I want to have a few rules appear in the box when you make a post in my subreddit. (r/assistance). You know so people can not miss it. 

Is there anyone out there that might be willing to do this for me?

 




 /r/SantasLittleHelpers brings Christmas to hundreds of families every year who wouldn't have otherwise been able to join in the giving. The only thing as awesome as the giving itself, is to see the results as pictures come in from all over the world of families opening their present on Christmas Day. 

Here is the video from Christmas 2013:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUyt_JwBDeQ

We are looking to do the same and are eagerly searching for one of you fine and talented individuals who is willing to put together a  video for Christmas 2014.

We have hundreds and hundreds of photos and have a background song already picked out. Is there someone out there who would be willing to help us out? 




 Don't do anything stupid and just stay inside. Be ready for the worst. We are here for you.

 I am making this request on behalf of /u/justaluckyshot, one of our mods and a good friend. Yesterday he lost someone very dear to him and the family needs help with the funeral costs. I can provide a paypal address if you care to help.

Justaluckyshot is famous for helping folks out here with car problems of all kinds. He has helped so many and I am asking for help in his time of need.

There are about 12 people who have full access. I believe one of them is deleting entries that they shouldn't be. I would like to find out who and the information they have been deleting. 

If this is the wrong place to post this, please let me know.

Thank you.

 The person is a vet, already served with eviction papers. They need lots of help in many areas but my first piece of advice is to declare bankruptcy. Can you please give advice of how to declare bankruptcy in specifically in Michigan using a Paralegal.

And also if there are any option with eviction.

The user's name is /u/Alohm1ab

They really need help and might be out in the very cold streets soon. Workingon other stuff but bankruptcy seems a must here. They just owe too much money

It will be worth it though. Cheers to you my friend. Let me know if you need some help in the future. I am not far away at all. :D

 Sylvester came over and gave me an estimate today. It was a very reasonable price. I am having him do it next Monday. Thanks so much for the reference. He was way cheaper than a carpet store would have been. :D

 Good luck. :D 




 A brilliant interview. Really showed a side of our president people needed to see.

Too bad most people won't. The will just freak that he said the word nigger. Where has our culture gone?

 It was a brilliant interview. And anyone who anything negative to say about it should actually listen it to it first.

You can listen to the entire interview here:

 Yea, there's always some unhappy person out there trying to spread their misery. So glad we got you back though. :D

Thank you for bringing your kindness here. :D

 I'm not supporting Hillalry. I am calling out you Bernie bots that conduct this daily circlejerk on reddit about the godliness of Bernie and the Satan like behavior of Hillary. 

I can tell you I won't support Bernie though. And the reason is not him. It's you. 

A group made up of blind supporters who blather endlessly over every word he says and condemns anyone or anything that does not worship him,   is called a cult. Sorry Nancy, I'm not joining any cults today.

 




 This isn't a news article. It's propaganda from his own site. So excusing me if I don't cum all over the screen like the rest of you Bernie bots in this never-ending circle jerk.  




 Aren't jokes supposed to be funny? 




 Get a room already. 




 Climb down off your soapbox there. You are going hurt yourself.

I have defended no one. I am just calling out you and this article's over-zealous circle.jerk 




 Tell me that next June after Hillary wins on the first ballot. 




 Excellent. :D 




 Let's give it a few more minutes. Let me know if it come through. 




 Check your email. It should have been sent immediately. Let me know if you don't get it. 




 Sure thing. I have been there and am thankful I can help others now. Good luck to you. :D 




 A $25 gift code for Pizza Hut has been sent to by email. 

May brighter days be in your future. :D 




 I agree. It is easy to get caught up in the hype. Some just want a woman on a bill and don't care who gets kicked off to make it happen. 




 Okay, PM your real name and email address and I will see what i can do. 




 Way cool. I will give him a call this week and have him come out. I so appreciate the help. I'll let you know how it worked out. :D 




 what pizza places are near you? 




 Thank you. Your post is all set. Good luck. :D 




 You know I read that headline wrong. I thought it said he worked to increase the wealth at the expense of the lower class. Glad to see that I was wrong.  




 I would very interested. I don't want to go to a carpet store and get taken advantage of. I got the carpet from a house we remolded. It is practically brand new. A carpet place would overcharge me I know. 

I work in the construction trade and we all do side jobs like this but I want a good a job. 

I would very much appreciate the reference.  




 This article says:

 At least 5,500 Coloradans crammed into a Denver gymnasium, an adjacent atrium, and lacrosse field Saturday night to hear presidential candidate and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders speak, in what is being reported as one of the biggest political rallies so far in the 2016 election cycle.

Hillary rally had an estimate of 5,500 - 7000 people. 

http://www.politicususa.com/2015/06/13/hillary-clinton-draws-biggest-crowd-2016-hopeful-nyc-rally.html

I have read three different numbers of the actual crowd but it was as large or larger than Bernie's. To say "one of the largest crowds" is very ambiguous and exaggerated on purpose.

 Makes a great bumper sticker, but that's it.  




 Horseshit! 

One of **his** biggest crowds. Not one of **the** biggest crowds. So he filled a high school gymnasium. Hillary had twice that many last week. 

Words like massive, astronautical, huge, and others like are being thrown about in extremely  exaggerated and misused. Have fun with your little circle jerk and watch as he fades into obscurity just like Ron Paul when you blathered over him.

 I had a bankruptcy ten years ago. I thought they only stayed on your record for seven years. I thought it might be advantageous to get a credit card just to try and rebuild my credit at my bank but I was turned down. Despite having 20 grand in my account for over a year now. The reason given was my bankruptcy.

Should that bankruptcy still  be on my record and do I need to take steps to get it removed? Any other tips on how to rebuild my credit would be welcome. I do not need the credit now. I just want it to be there should I ever need it.

 Today's thought of the day comes in form of an observation from a fictional alien from the planet K-PAX (a great Kevin Spacey movie)


The alien from K-PAX told the psychiatrist we have no laws and no lawyers. When asked by the psychiatrist how do we know right from wrong the alien replied:

-----------------


**Every being in the universe knows right from wrong. Let me tell you something. You humans, most of you, subscribe to this policy of an eye for an eye, a life for a life, which is known throughout the universe for its stupidity. Even your Buddha and your Christ had quite a different vision; but nobody's paid much attention to them, not even the Buddhists or the Christians. You humans, sometimes its hard to imagine youve made it this far.**

 There are some people that seem to post only from a few sites and they do not get banned for spamming. An example of this would be a porn site. My subreddit is not a porn subreddit but many of the people that post to it, are getting reported for spam. I feel it is an attack of some sort.  Is there anyway Ii can get the same exemption for my subscribers? Or anyway I can protect these users?

I posted about this before:

But now we are looking for something more permanent for them. They have good jobs, are good people and just need a place **immediately** to move into. We have the proper funds but need something affordable and right away.

Please help me find this family a place. They are currently in a hotel and need something to move into now. 




 Which I would be happy to do. And we would be happy to promote your sub as well.  




 You fail to mention that over half of that money given came from me. I gave her that money because I know it was a legitimate cause. You people just love to omit any fact that does  not support your twisted  bullshit witch hunts. 

Please if you think you can do it better, I challenge you to do so. You will soon see how hard it is to give thousands of dollars to people and then have worthless pieces of crap like you make such accusations.

 If the clerk's office had another person that would issue the license there all the time, that would be fine. But that is not the case. These people are being told they have to go to another county. As long as the service is provided, then it would be up to the office there to decide if they want to keep her. But many places are not going to hire two people to do the job of one.

And with the McDonald's analogy, if the employer wanted to hire someone knowing that they would just do fries, that would be up to the employer. Not the employee. 




 I have no room to talk. I'm trying to work up the balls to do this myself. I just see your week as an enormous accomplishment. I am jealous. I would hate to see it go to waste.  




 Having just one cig will hurt more than any other cigarette you will ever have. Man i am so envious of you quitting for a week. As I work up the balls to quit myself, I see folks like you who have made it a week and am amazed.

Seriously dude, you are awesome for what you have done. Don't blow it now.  




 You never know. They may already be doing it. :O 




 This lady is the only one in that entire county that performs that duty. If she can't deliver to 10% of the population due to religious beliefs, then they either have to get another person that does, or replace her altogether. 

But even so, as a liberal, I do not agree with the headscarf thing. A company should have the right to dictate the uniform. 

 




 If your religion forbids it then it up to you to do what it takes to comply. 

 




 I love this! :D

 "May" being the operative word. To rule in his favor would open up such a can of worms that cause chaos. It's not going to happen. Just like the clerk will not be able to refuse marriage licenses. If your religion doesn't let you, then you need to get another job. 




 Then he needs to get a different job too. Don't see any religious obstacles in the laundry department. 




 They do the same with the constitution, the bible, and states rights. Only when it suits them.

So he assumes some of the rapists are good people?

  She pledged to never issue a marriage license to a gay couple.

 Its a deep-rooted conviction; my conscience wont allow me to do that, Davis said Tuesday. It goes against everything I hold dear, everything sacred in my life.

Well that is fine and dandy. I have no problem with that honey. But you obviously have to get a new job then.

 Hillary Clinton's 2015 shattered the $26 million the former first lady raised raised in the first quarter of her 2008 bid. That number was made up of $19.1 million for the primary, and $6.9 million for the general election.

 Thanks for your response. We are having some luck here and the people of Maine are impressing the hell out of me. Some very kind people there. 

They will arrive in the state tomorrow and hopefully one of these leads will pan out. If not they may have to so what you suggest. Having the four girls will prove difficult. they can't leave them in the woods while they go to work. But we are working on a solution.

 Thank you. I have been calling some of them. Very pricey for this weekend. I think we may have better luck after the 4th. Thanks so much for reading and offering your advice. Much appreciated. 

Have a happy 4th. :D 




 Thanks for helping. We'll get them through this. It sure helps to have folks like you help us with some leads. Thank you so much. :D 




 That is a great suggestion. Being 4th of July weekend coming up, we are having an extremely difficult time finding some. But we haven't ruled that option out. :D 




 A cabin would be awesome. I would help with the rent if it is not too much. 




 I am the head mod over at r/assistance where we help people in amazing ways due the the awesomeness of reddit..


Currently we have a family, one that is very dear to me and I will vouch for wholehearted. Actually it is one of my long time mods who has helped hundreds of others. The husband and wife worked at the same place and long story short they lost their jobs due to a very unruly owner.

The two have both found new jobs in Biddeford. They start Friday. They have packed up all their belongings and are currently in Vermont heading that way. But they have no place to stay. I have found arrangements for them and their four girls, and two small dogs as of July 7th. But they need a place to stay until then. Even someone's backyard. 

They start their new life but need help with a place to stay for the week so they can go to work. The last thing we want is for them to screw up on the new job. It was a magnificent break for them both to get jobs there.

Again these are good people and they just need to get through this tough time. For now, all we need is place for them to stay this next week. Maybe somewhere in Biddeford, Alfred, or Saco.

They really need your help. Please open your hearts and help me help them. I personally guarantee they are a good honest family. I am lucky to call them friends.  




 The GOP may be regretting a lot of things. We can only hope. 




 Best of luck. :D

 Sure they cool. Just over-rated. 




 Firefighters are severely overrated. More people risk their lives every day constructing a building than saving them from burning down. I know lots of firefighters. Many of them are douches and think they are god's gift to society. 




 :D 




 Reddit expected to get 68 posts about it. 




 A man of the people:

 Love how no matter what, you can find a way to make a negative out of it. I have an aunt like that. Everyone hates her. 




 The GOP has it backwards?

 Yes, Real Clear Politics who predicted Romney would win handily. 




 #When the past calls, let it go to voicemail, believe me, it has nothing new to say. 




 Yes. Have you watched MSNBC lately? Rachel does stuff on him every night. He gets way more coverage than Hillary. The same on the Huffington Post. With some 20 declared candidates and a plethora of those who  soon will, Bernie gets the most coverage out of all of them. 




 real clear bias

Boy that website sure has gone downhill. 




 Bernie is getting plenty of coverage. More so than almost any other candidate. This whining about coverage is getting old. It also is not true. 




 He didn't lose it. In fact he kind of fucks with the director. It was quite humorous.

 You didn't miss a thing. 




  Why are you Hillary people so fucking arrogant?

 




 Karma's a bitch..., ain't it? 




 The UN does not abide by our constitution. And in case you haven't notice, guns are not banned. 




 That was the most polite rant I have ever heard. 




 It is not disagreeing  with Hilary we have a problem with here. It is you rude and  blatant disrespectful behavior  for other users. You have been warned before. You will not be warned again. 




 Thank you. Your post is all set. Good luck. :D

It was Martin Luther King  worthy.
