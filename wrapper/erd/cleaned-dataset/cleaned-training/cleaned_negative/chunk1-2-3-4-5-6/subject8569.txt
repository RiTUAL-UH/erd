I've been enjoying r/aviation for a while now, and often see fantastic pictures taken from airplane windows.

Then, I thought, what a good idea for a subreddit. I was surprised I couldn't find one, so took a chance and started my first sub. If you also like pictures taken from airplanes, please promote, subscribe and contribute! Thanks. [r/picturesfromplanes](http://www.reddit.com/r/PicturesFromPlanes/).

PS - I hope this isn't considered SPAM.
**TL/DR: PicturesFromPlanes, new sub.**

 I was just curious as to how (and if) they go about salvaging equipment from a crash like Flight 214. Is there a company that specializes in doing that? Is everything just written off? Any information would be appreciated. 










































































































































































































































 I kind of wish I'd become a pilot... 



















 Seems to me most folks here aren't down with writing 750 characters or more. 




 I mean, besides to obvious, swimming pools and such. 




























































































































 I was thinking about guitarists. Take two people at the same age, teach them guitar the same way, have them practice the same amount, etc. One person is invariably going to excel over the other. The same thing applies with other things, like sports, games, etc. Why? 














 Wow. Close call for me. 2007 Mini idling rough, slight clacking sound. Checked oil, thought there was plenty. Nope. Turns out it was down to ONE quart. Gasp. No harm done, but I will be checking properly every few weeks from now on... 











































































































































 Even if you aren't currently on death row, you can still answer. I would have fried clams, flank steak, garlic mashed potatoes and a double IPA to wash it down

 I think it would be fun to be a golf ball, because you'd fly high and fast through the air. 
























 And get offa' my lawn while you're at it! 































































































































































































































































































































 Getting Chinese food, want something new... 





























 It's raining. Again. 










































































 Just throwing this out there for discussion. I noticed Sunday when Bell was near the sideline on a few runs, he stepped out like Franco used to, rather than smashing into the defensive man, like Bettis loved to do. I am conflicted, because I loved the way Bettis would punish people, but I also want Bell healthy for a loooong time. Thoughts? 


















































































































 Me - I don't know my blood type. Or CPR. Seems those are good things to know.

 That tick's like, "Ohhhhhh fuck yeah..." 




 Winter is here. 




 In the pacific northwest, there's a small, harmless snake (the garter snake) with a wide ranging diet. One particular population preys mostly upon newts, the catch being that these newts contain tetrodotoxin (apparently aquired from bacteria; the same chemical is the toxin in pufferfish). As a result of their prey's super-potent nerve toxin, the snakes have evolutionarily modified the sodium channels in their nerves to be less responsive to that toxin (which has had secondary effects of decreasing nerve performance). Of course, this set up an evolutionary arms race, with more toxic newts evolving, which lead to more resistant snakes, which lead to more toxic newts, etc.


However, tetrodoxin takes a while to break down. It disappears fairly fast from most of the snake's tissues, except for their livers, which it accumulates in large quantities for long periods of time. This has the potential effect of making these snakes toxic to many of their native predators, especially birds. Other species do this too (dart frogs actually get their poison from ants and beetles), so it's technically truly a poisonous snake. 




 I was on a SW flight landing at Midway during winter. We had to pull up about 50 feet from the ground because a snowplow was on the runway. 




 I heard somewhere those can take off vertically. 




 TIL they are still making Rock Band games. 




 Yeah, the poor bastard who cleans the bathrooms. 




 Oh, good. Looks like some bullet holes shot under where the door latch is, too. 




 Too cheap to spring for a fleshlight, eh? 




 Were the chicken wings moldy? Might be some squatters living in it. 




 /r/animalid or /r/whatisthisthing might help too. 




 I said it looked poisonous because its head looks to be triangular, like a viper. Perhaps a water moccasin?

 Yes. I will do this. And buy a used 918 at a hefty premium. 




 Any educated guesses as to about when the fleet looked like this? 









 I've mentioned this game to several friends and they never played. We are talking about the game wih "spreads" if the ball touched you twice, right? You had to face the wall and everyone had a free throw at you?
