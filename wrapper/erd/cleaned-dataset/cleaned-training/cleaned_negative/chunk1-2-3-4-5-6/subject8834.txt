 Good point, but technically he would still have Stark blood in him. 




 Yes but he was legitimized as a Stark, which makes him the heir to Winterfell. If anything I think that it would become voided if it were ever to come to light that he was actually Rheagar's son.  




 Start using the tape deck hookup and then come talk to me.  




 I have seen a lot of talk on this subreddit about the R+L=J theory. Some people think that this would make him heir to the Iron Throne. Correct me if I'm wrong, but wouldn't he still be a bastard but only with a different father? He still would not have any better claim to the throne then he does now. I could be completely wrong here so if I am will somebody please explain what the significance of this theory is? 




 Yeah, I just watched it last night. Thought it was a pretty good movie.  









 Just because one person says Fringe is bad, doesn't make it a bad TV show.

 At least he can re-watch all of his favorite TV shows. The question is...how does he know which one's were his favorite? 




 I really wish I didn't read as fast as I did. Now that I am finished with all four books I can't sop thinking about A Dance with Dragons!!! 




 Was just about to post this until I saw yours.  




 All of these characters have much bigger roles in books 2 and 3, so I would imagine that they will also get more screen time as well.

 Overall average for WI according to your link. In Ohio, starting wage is $33,671 and averages is $50,314. Regardless, I would have to agree that $38,284 is a very low average salary in WI.

 Honestly though...it's a user review for a videogame. I could log on right now and give it a 0/10 just for spite. I would care more if we were talking about a Critic Review.  




 We are talking about starting wages. A teacher with tenure will end up making much more than $35,000. I would be more concerned about losing benefits, because I would say that is one of the stronger benefits that teachers get once hired.  




 True, but that is the same boat every kid is in when getting out of college. Even $30,000 is a very livable wage. I am not saying I agree with what is going on, but I don't think teachers are underpaid.  




 In Ohio, starting wage for a teacher is about $35,000. Take from that what you will, but after becoming tenured teachers can start to earn a very nice wage.  




 If this is from Youngstown State University I wouldn't be suprised if people just don't show up and email the professor after the exam. 




 Enslaved: Odyssey to the West  




 Everyone has the right of police protection. What RP is saying is that one person will end up paying for their education while another doesn't have to pay a dime. Same goes for healthcare.  




 I think a lot of people here are taking that quote out of context. He is talking about college, not kindergarten. 
A better quote is this:
"Prices go up on the tuition and then we give them grants and then they get out of the college and they owe $200,000. It makes no sense whatsoever. I don't think how anybody can justify it."  




 Agreed.  




 I disagree with this. I think you overestimate the value of our technological advantage. We are an occupying force in Iraq, where someone can bomb a humvee and then go run over to a mosque and hide. Precision air strikes are basically pointless. Both sides are still shooting bullets at each other.  
























 One of the best things I have ever read on Reddit.  




 Real laughter was produced. 




 I am going to go against the grain and say Ned Stark would make an amazing King. Ask yourself where we would be today in the world of Westeros if Ned was king instead of Robert. The kingdom would not be in debt, no bastard children, the people would be well taken care of and justice would be handled properly. I also don't see treachery getting as close to Ned as it did Robert, as the latter made increasingly bad decisions over the course of years (as king, and with his wife) to end up in the situation that he was in.   




 Like...shaving? 




 Regardless of whether you agree with the current wars we are involved in, the man is putting his life on the line in the defense of our nation. That deserves thanks.

 It has been a while for me, but didn't Theon claim Robb "King in the North" first in aGoT? 




 That song was amazing. Also, now I suddenly have the strong urge to play a JRPG... 




 You are not redoing the animations, just tweaking them.  




 That seems like something to me that can be easily remedied. It is not some game breaking combat glitch or graphical issue.  




 As well as new melee attacks (which look to be class specific). Also weapon mods, more customization under skill trees, smarter AI, and more responsive controls.

Plus, you are also only taking into account the combat we have seen thus far. There also looks to be some pretty cool on-rails combat sequences as well as a much more epic scale to the battles.  




 This game doesn't come out until March, so I think there is more than enough time to smooth out the animations on characters.  




 Knowing BioWare, Mass Effect 3 is probably going to be a lot more than that.  




 I would visit newegg.com and look at some of the available laptops they have on their website. Usually there are user reviews that accompany each laptop that will speak towards their gaming performance.  




 thanks for the advice! :)

 Lets just say that Jon snow was killed by his attackers, then was brought back to life. That would mean that his vows would have been fulfilled, and he no longer is bound to the Nights Watch.

*Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my **death**.*

 




 Yes, it was from Winterfell. In my OP, I was referring to the fact there was no raven from Winterfell sent to the king at Kings Landing.  




 There was never a raven sent from Winterfell bearing news of the battle to Kings Landing. 




 This. There should/would have been a raven from Winterfell if Stannis was defeated.  




 I would have to agree with your last statement. Theon and Jeyne are both with Stannis last we read, so if Stannis truly was defeated then it stands to reason that he would already have found Jeyne and Theon again. 

Mance probably gave up that Jon sent him, but I doubt that in that short span he was able to defeat Stannis as well.  




 I just finished aDwD and was pretty pissed off when I read that Jon was killed. You have just gave me a small glimmer of hope. 




 I have been eyeing it up for a while, but was always afraid to click...haha 




 Just a thought, but I think it would allow a lot more people to discuss the events of the book without having to worry about accidently running into spoiler events from later on in the book.  




 What if there was alcohol involved? 




 It should be noted that you cannot have sex temporarily. I don't see this as such a big issue. The man that you are with is probably going to spend a lot of time with you "working" on your condition, so it's not like any kind of sexual interaction is off the table. Also, the potential payoff should things turn around is pretty high.  




 Yeah, I think was important to show these people so the reader can understand the motives behind their decisions.  




 I liked it a lot. Jaime's chapters were great, as well as Brienne's. I also thought the way Cersei's character developed over the course of the book was pretty interesting.  




 He doesn't count Jon as one of Catelyn's children 
























 Probably first and only time I post here, but wow.

 Obviously there has been improvements, but overall it is more Battlefield. Mostly all new additions are welcome, even though some need more work. Graphically(XBOX 360), this game looks to be comparable to Modern Warfare 3. 

It's a good game, but too early to tell if it will be great(or surpass MW3 for that matter).

 tubgirl 




 I am betting it has something to do with adjustments made to a part of ME2 that was less than popular. Mining?  




 I am just curious if you think games like Mass Effect and Deus Ex are also wrong for coming out with content for the game after release. 




 EDIT: I'm a dumbass and can't put shit in the right place 




 Yeah, but we seem to constantly rip MW3 for this while letting every other game off easy. What about Battlefield 3 or Gears of War 3?  




 I didn't know Call of Duty was the only game to release map packs. Interesting.

 I think if you were moving FTL, than most of these rules would no longer apply, since our understanding of the universe is based off of a theory that states this is not possible.  




 I am pretty sure that Brian Greene explains this in *The Elegant Universe*. It's been a while since I read it though. He explains how one can essentially "travel through time" given our current understanding of the universe.

 That's the point. Ron Paul even says, " I just don't think we're at the point where anybody has absolute proof on either side". 




 Ron Paul definitely believes in a creator, and in that sense he does believe in creationism. However, what he (and, originally, you) is arguing is the theory of evolution which specifies how we as human beings came to be and not necessarily who created us.  




 Actually that statement says that he does not believe either side of the argument entirely. By your logic, that would put him squarely in the anti-creationist camp as well. 

EDIT: Spelling 
























 I played MW2 a lot over the weekend in anticipation of MW3's release, and after hearing that MW3 multiplayer was basically MW2.5 I was pretty excited. However, as soon as I popped in MW3, the first thing I noticed is some of my favorite guns don't "feel" the same. The long range accuracy of the UMP45 isn't there anymore when you "feather" the trigger. The M16 isn't as accurate. MP5 still isn't back to its COD4 glory days. Overall, I think the guns have more kick, and have trouble staying on target like they did in previous games (MW2). I still love the game, and my KDR will probably increase after getting used to some of the subtle changes in the guns, but I was wondering if anyone else noticed some of these changes?  




 I thought Black Ops was probably one of the biggest disappointments I have had, and almost put me off Call of Duty all together. If this isn't like that game, I am happy.  




 Not at all. The Vet and Noob video was amazing.  




 I don't think you read the original comment. Receiving something from someone with the knowledge that it is stolen is a felony. Previously, the OP stated that his copy of the game was acquired by "less than legal" means. 




 Yeah, I got it too. Thought it was a joke.  




 You know receiving stolen property is a felony, right? Not saying that I wouldn't do the same thing in your shoes, but I certainly wouldn't be advertising it by playing on Live or posting on the internet.

 This is what needs to happen: Elementary school teachers need to be competent at math. They can't simply "love working with kids" and "enjoy telling stories and doing arts and crafts." You need to know your shit. You need to know everything about everything because little kids ask questions that are creative and insightful and completely off the wall. 

This. Yes, we need to pay teachers better. Yes, we need smaller classrooms. However, we also need to reform what it takes to become an educator, so we have teachers that are above average in all areas (i.e. reading, writing, match, science), as opposed to barely competent in any. There are a lot of great teachers out there. I was lucky to have a few that shaped my life forever. There are a lot of really bad teachers out there too, and we need to make it more difficult to become an educator to weed these people out.  




 At first, I read this as, "Why don't you fuck more students?"

 As I said before, I was on obm.ohio.gov and I was not able to find specifically what I was looking for. 




 I have been trying to find a breakdown of the yearly budget for the State of Ohio.

 If I really wanted to understand the entire story, would it be better to start at Uncharted or Uncharted 2?

 Didn't see it and figured reddit would tell me if link was already posted.  









 I am not telling you do anything, and I definitely do not agree with incorporating any personal beliefs or opinions into education/politics. What I am saying is that I accept the fact that people have different beliefs than I do, and I don't belittle them for it. 

Personally I think it is ridiculous that so many people allow their own personal beliefs to influence their decision making in regards to politics/policymaking. The fact that people like Rick Santorum can potentially become the President of the United States of America shows that we are still a long way away from achieving that kind of separation of not only church and state, but personal/moral beliefs and state.  




 uh huh, tell me more about how I'm trying to govern people's private lives using a 2000 year old book with no scientific support as my guidelines. fuck you.

Never said you were. I said that you only think what you believe as correct and allow no room for anyone else's beliefs/opinions. Just because you choose not to believe in an idea that has no scientific backing to prove it does not make it ridiculous. That is what the main problem of this video is. Atheism is no longer just denying the existence of a supernatural creator, it's about throwing it in everyone else's face and telling them to "fuck off" if they don't agree.  




 Mark Meer is badass.  




 I would have to say this is a pretty narcissistic point of view. Just because you don't hold the same beliefs as another it suddenly becomes inferior and not deserving of respect. That puts you on the same level as idiots like Rick Santorum.

Thanks though.  




 Can anyone get a 1920x1200 version? The only one I see is the one from bioware that has the banners.  




 What this tells me, is that a Mass Effect movie would be amazing. Here's to hoping that there is enough positive feedback from ME3 to prompt more discussion on this.  




 Mine would be that I love to cook/bake, and I like to keep my kitchen looking nice. Just picked up a new set of Pfaltzgraff dishes and I plan on picking up the matching set pieces when I get a few more bucks.

 I am probably the one of the only people who disagrees with this. Definitely a very good story for the second game in a trilogy.  




 Especially the last few seconds of video in this trailer.  




 Aside from some of the others I have already seen posted here, I would really like to be able to re-experience Grandia 2 again. One of my favorite games of all times. Also, Enslaved: Odyssey to the West.  




 Good pick. I put down the second game after about 2 hours of playing, but the first still ranks as one of my favorite games.  




 I laughed pretty hard at this... 




 As did I. Seriously, I was thinking, "28 comments...nobody could have thought about Dead Island yet." 




 The Wheel of Time (series) is every bit as good in my opinion. On book number 4 right now and can't stop reading.

 Not an insult, just stating a point. Also in your previous post you neglected to mention that his affiliation with the Tea Party had anything to do with your not respecting him. Also, even if he is a member of the Tea Party, that doesn't make him any less of a person. I can understand your sentiment if he was one of the crazies in the crowd holding up signs calling Obama a Muslim, but nothing you have said here seems to indicate that.  




 Looks like you are the one being judgmental, not him.  




 I agree with this 100%. Your first few bullets almost never seem to make contact although you are aiming right at the guy! I have a 30Mb connection with a 15ms ping and I consistently run into these problems in MW3.  




 Is this only on PC version, or can you see this on Xbox as well? 




 This guy said he liked Twilight Princess's controls better. His major gripe about the game has just been invalidated.  




 I agree. Sometimes it takes a good minute before a care package even comes out and by that time the round might be over.  




 I actually think this is good, because it will force IW to get a patch out reasonably quick due to the amount of people who will most likely have this problem. Hopefully they will take care of some other things along with this.  




 I don't know why you are getting downvoted. Even though the OP made a mistake I think this is what he was getting at.  




 Bog! Anyone?

G36C (Red Dot Sight)

 Am I the only one that thinkgs the UM is a lot less OW than from MW2? 




 Haters gunna hate. This place is like /r/gaminghipsters. 




 Normally I would say so, but after maxing out the UMP it still isn't quite like the MW2 version IMO. No big deal, just takes some getting used to.  
























 Black Car. Always burn my arm on the center console when I get in (on sunny days).  




 Downtown is great, but I have lived in Merriman Valley for 3 years in love it. Great bars, close proximity to downtown(5-10 min), state parks, etc. Like somebody else said though, don't live in Timbertop. Try Pheasant Run or Hampton Knoll.  




 I don't know about anyone else, but I really miss those Hunter: The Reckoning games on the PS2/XBOX. Some of the best co-op memories I've ever had.  




 I feel almost exactly the same. Sure there are some things I didn't like about the ending, but that is life. My big thing, which looks to be getting addressed, was the lack of closure. Add in some free DLC for someone who very much likes the multiplayer, and I give Bioware/EA a "thumbs up".

Keep in mind though, I still plan on thoroughly vetting Bioware's next release before I buy. No more preordering every game like I did with DA2 and ME3. To be honest, I still think Dragon Age 2 and EA "pimping out" the Bioware brand gets to me more than ME3 ever did.   




 May have playable content. I would not read too much into what was said there, as it is neither outright confirmed or denied.  




 Egwene.  




 Geez, excuse me for being an idiot. I read that probably 4 times, and thought it said, "You *can't* love your government...". 

My fault 




 I couldn't disagree more. I love this country and I love what it represents, and I feel that the government, as well as the people in control of it (and policy making) are slowly destroying this country. The fact that people even believe a statement like this is proof of that, in my opinion. 

EDIT: I'm a moron; misread text. 




 Am I the only one that thinks it wouldn't have to be 14 movies long? Sure, the first one should be based off of EotW, but after that I imagine they could take out a lot of filler and condense the series into about 7 or so movies. Maybe even less if they decide to leave certain events out completely.  




 Asshole much? (good job deleting your other posts) 




 I gave you an example in the post above of as to why, so I will not repeat it here. Also, while I agree that the ending was not good at all and has potentially cost Bioware/EA my business, I find it ironic that you describe my opinion on this matter as a difference in taste. One could argue that for every opinion that people have on the last 5% of Mass Effect 3. 

The harsh reality is that many (not all) people attempting to return Mass Effect 3 are scorned fans trying to get back at BioWare/EA any way they can, and looking for ways to make a quick $60 without justification. Much of the way people react to anything BioWare related now, and to other people who don't hold the same beleifs as this sub-reddit, reinforces this. Sadly though and also somewhat ironic, with business being a dog-eat-dog world, this is probably going produce a bigger impact than probably any other protesting method would. 

Also, let me just say that I support almost everything else being done to show BioWare/EA our displeasure, and a lot of what they do in the next few weeks will be the deciding factor in whether or not I will ever buy another game from them again.  




 So is a music CD. 




 Yes, it is my say, because it's my opinion. Just because you are allowed to ask for you money back doesn't make it the thing to do. I am going to take my box of Raisin Bran back to the store because there wasn't enough raisins in by last bowl of cereal. If I bitch enough, maybe they'll give me my money back. That doesn't make me any less of an asshole though.

 I'd probably toss the shit in the guys face, and then demand to speak to the manager. This would most likely result in me getting my money back, but it really doesn't have anything to do with what I mentioned above. A bad ending in a videogame is a lot different than a mouthful of shit. You don't see people returning DVDs for refunds because they didn't like the ending of Lost, or taking back books just because they didn't like the ending. 

Generalizations like this are garbage. It's one thing to be upset with a company like Bioware and speak with your wallet, and it's something entirely different when you try to weasel out of paying $60+ for a game you just played the entire way through. I for one, probably won't be buying another BioWare/EA product without first making sure via reviews and customer opinion that the game is actually good. They've lost my trust, and as a company they will have to earn it back. That is how spending money works.  




 Hoping this is a joke. I still think it is beyond ridiculous to play a game all the way through and then ask for your money back, regardless of how the ending made you feel.  




 Fuck that. I wanted Aria. 




 What.the.fuck?

 I wish some of these were higher res.  




 I'm almost afraid to post in this thread for fear of getting downvoted. Almost... 




 I started in late November 2011. Just finished up ToM last week.  




 So it can't be both?

 Mass Effect 2 was not as heavily advertised as 3 was, and Skyrim was released during the holiday season. With more examples, I'd be willing to accept that this was in part due to the endings, but I think this is just conjecture.  









 Looks kinda like the Citadel in Mass Effect 




 Your choices are reflected throughout the entire 3rd game sans the last 5 minutes. That doesn't mean you wont get a completely unique experience for the first 25 hours. In fact, its been proven you will. 




 Its kind of ironic that everyone is talking about how much better the ending would be with this stuff when almost every line of dialog was in the game.  




 Good thing Mass Effect 3 isn't a bad game. This is kinda getting out of hand.  




 You can't really mirror what the player is going through because each player is going to handle the situation differently.  




 In my opinion, creating brand new endings would be a disservice to everyone, especially the people that don't mind the current ending. I still think we should get more closure, and perhaps have some of the storylines that we followed throughout the series wrapped up, but completely re-writing the ending because a large portion of the gaming community doesn't agree with it isn't the answer. 

IMO, re-writing the endings would be the equivalent of taking a toy from one kid and giving it to the another that's crying because he doesn't have it (I am by no means saying that anyone is crying, just an analogy). I would rather see compromise.  




 You explained my sentiment exactly.  




 To be fair, anything that involves one weapon wiping out an entire race of super-beings is going to be space magic. 




 In all honesty, I think the endings themselves weren't bad at all. The main problem was the lack of content associated with each ending. I am just speaking for myself, but I would be happy if Bioware added about 10-15 minutes of extra, *unique*, content into each ending to allow for a little diversity between playthroughs and to close up to unfinished story beats. This in turn would give them the opportunity to add closure to a lot of the storylines (as well as Renegade/Paragon consequences) that have been progressing throughout the course of the series.  




 Thanks for the link. I was wondering if I could get larger versions of these images.  




 I feel comfortable with a sword now, I quite enjoy wielding one. I wouldn't profess to be good in a real life and death situation. Enough to maybe hopefully impress the ladies.

Best line in the interview 
 




 Most other have already been mentioned, but I really like the scenes with Mat and Talmanes (also, the Band in general). Also at the very end when Olver opens up the letter from Verin.  




 I think your description of this moment makes it even better.

EDIT: I'm a dumbass, and I thought you were asking where the "His name was Marauder Shields." came from.  




 I was thinking of this one too.  




 Now I feel like I have to go to my Walmart and see if they have this shirt. 




 Neither did I. I google'd and came up with this:

 I stand corrected. I didn't realize WoT fans were that upset over some of the later books in the series.  




 is it just me or do most of the one star reviews actually talk about how good the book is?
