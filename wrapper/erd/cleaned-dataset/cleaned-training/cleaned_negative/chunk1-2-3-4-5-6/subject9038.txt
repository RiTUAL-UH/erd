 Well while I was searching through YouTube I found a video of Robert Downey Jr's song "Man like me" and right away I tought: yup I have to learn how to play that song
So I went to google and searched the chords and in ultimate guitar the song was missing some text so I was wondering if you guys could help me with the song? Just standart tuning guitar tabs here are the lyrics:

Thank you! 




 Well I don't have money right now and the game is on sale so I would be very grateful if someone could buy me the game. Thanks in advance 




 I want it 
























 My point was that there are some SOME :D important questions there and noone give a f**k about those people 




 Booooooooring....
 




 I really want that awesome game and if anyone is willing to send it as a gift I would be grateful.
P.S.- I can't buy the game. I'm low on cash.

Here is my steam ID. Just add me:

 Marry me. You are beautiful 




 My main is an asura thief named Lil'Stealthy. Some time ago I played WoW and I loved rogues. Thief just reminds me of the time when I played that pay-to-play game. Now I am happy to say that GW2 is better! You know the addiction to WoW you get when you play it. I had it but now with the help of GW2 everything changed :)
 




 I would really love to get a key 
























 Never thought of the guild thingy. Will do so. I hate being serious in a guild - that's the problem. Right now I am in 2 guilds. Both of them are pretty serious but I said to the main guy that I won't be serious and I will be more like a representative of those guilds. If they want they could kick me - they didn't do so. 




 One word: IKEA 




 OMG This is Beautiful!!!!
