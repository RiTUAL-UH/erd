 Im not a fan of the "waves of zombies from generator being on" but i can see it attracting ones that are already nearby due to noise.
Edit: i would also like to add I love the idea of the higher number of people required for progression. A person will always be able to find a group. 




 Lolwut  




 Okay i see your point. The only problem for me is if i miss that first shot, im toast. 




 Often in a group ill choose the sks, because normally someone else has long range, but what would you pick if you were alone? 




 My goal of this  post is to always have a definitive choice when it comes to these guns. So could you please tell me why the mosin over the sks. 




 A lot of times thats what i think, but the fact that the mosin is always a one hit kill makes me torn between the two. 




 Its most likely that same part, but for the Remington 870
 




 Epoch. Best version of dayz out there. 




 I get that, and there are quite the number
Of troll fresh spawns. I wish there was a way to make this work regardless. 




 Alright, i see where you're coming from. Im just very tired of spawning in, walking for a minute and a half just to get offed by a guy with a mosin on some roof 




 Just no? No constructive criticism?  
























  This time, the doors are standing wide open.


Edit: doors not soors
 




 Well my hope was that since its in the second person, you make that choice. What would YOU do in that situation. 




 Damnit Abigail. Get your shit together!
 




 makes sense. western jets are indeed, the coolest shit to ever have. ever. 




 I hate to tell you, but i've read a nosleep with the EXACT same plot, but I believe there was only one clone of the original... 




 Yeah, OP, i get you want this and i think its nice, but the truth is, they cant (and wont, i dont blame them) change a whole system that is already made, just to make crafting a bit more challenging.

Also, in some ways i dont like your idea. If you think to dayz epoch, it is very hard to build there. That has its problems, as it creates an extreme gap between the group of 10 guys with a cinder fortress and the noobs in the tent that get gunned down every five minutes.
 




 Even in dayz, kos city, i make it my goal to not have to put anyone down. Dont get me wrong, i die a lot, but i plan to be the friendliest guy you will meet. 




 Yeah the garand is the one im praying for.

 I would personally rather see more practical weapons. The xm2010 is rare as hell as is, and same for the m82. Desert eagles i guess, but they shouldn't be abundant. As for the tar and famas. The famas is an exotic weapon and should be rare. And the tar would probably be the civilian version (iwi tavor) and not have to be ultra rare 




 Alright so nearly every gun on earth... Don't forget, this is America. 


"America, where you can buy a gun for cheaper than a month's rent" 
























 No matter what country you come from, we can mostly all agree. EARTH, FUCK YEA! 




 people are applauding THIS pope, because he is the first one courageous enough to change those thoughts, which isn't that easy of a thing to do. 




 Bushmaster XM15, i got a magpul handguard, pistol grip, rear sight, and buttstock for it. Paid around 900$ for everything after mags and background check and all. 









 Oh shit they are the zombies!!! Its just worded very very well! 




 everyone! 




 didn't see that coming! 




 Are they cannibals? Or looking to steal food? Either way i like it! 




 I really like this story, probably one of the best 'zombie' stories ive read in a while 




 Thanks! 




 10/10 would crossbow again

Cold water to burn area. 




 I found two in a single boat just yesterday. 




 I can't express how much i love the 'police report' story 




 Really a great story! 




 *apologizes for not standing up for himself* 




 I would be really interested if you maybe made a bunch of these police recordings, maybe with different events and stuff. 




 I just got a chill. The chances that this is a real story hit me at the end... 




 I used to play fortunate son back in arma 2 domination 




 Confusin what is real!! 




 Nice rifle! 




 Thank you for making me feel welcome! 
























 Confirmed by the devs that lie to us about it in the first place... Not sure how i feel about this whole thing. 




 I mean shit if he had a chart, hes right... 




 Ask em to send it to you now, so it can be done by mid april! /s 




 We don't



*Airhorns blaze as Kruschev gets 360 noscoped.* 




 Theres a first time for everything i guess. 




 I for one love the crown victoria police car, for some reason i love that car and the way it looks in a police color scheme. If they were to add something for me it would be a Suburban SUV, and a Suburban police variant. If it holds eight people that will make my month 




 Curiosity is on around 800 days out of 650, so It's beaten the test as well, and It's still brand new! 




 I was actually contmplating watching that about five minutes ago! Glad I'm far too picky on netflix. 




 I don't see any reason both couldn't be sufficient. One for the dog one for the PC kinda thing. 




 Nvidia GTX 660 is mine, id like to win this for a friend with a laptop for a PC, so he can start a build. Gaben gave me steam sales, which took all of my money. Am starve. Still worth it though. 




 I imagined him with a Texas accent. 
























 I didnt expect to laugh out loud so badly while on the toilet today. 




 Holy shit dude, thats metal. 




 Yeah sub-hunter helicpters or boats with depth charges as a counter. Do they still use depth charges? 




 /r/theydidthemath 




 Oh damn i didnt even see that! Either way boonie hats make you like 6 times cooler in my opinion. 




 DayZ  




 I just wish I could've found a black armband rather than yellow. 









 /r/thalassophobia is what you are looking for. It's a subreddit dedicated to your fears. Don't feel bad I have it too... 




 I have it. Yesterday i was in the deep water, and I *dropped* my paddle in the water. I watched it sink, and was too scared to try and get it. I was out and stranded... The deep areas do a real good job of giving me anxiety attacks. Ive had two half panic attacks when a shark came out of *nowhere* and I just could not climb back into the raft.
