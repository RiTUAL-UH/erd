 I thought it looked like [this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/12/The_Neverhood_-_box_art.jpg). 




 One thing about online play is it's very impersonal. It's less like going on a blind date, and more like hiring a hooker. They aren't going to ask you about your life unless you want them to, and even then, they probably don't care. [They are just single-serving friends.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/quotes?item=qt0479153) You don't have to worry about what they think, because the game will probably fall apart in a couple months, and you will never talk to them again. 




 I have four gunners and four blasters, but I never use more than three total in any list. It'd be fun to run all eight some time just for shits and giggles. 




 Minions. 'Cause bacon. 




 Trolls  CoC  Cryx  Cephalyx  Thornfall  Legion  Blindwater  Searforge  Pirates  non-Pirate/non-Dwarf Mercs  Cygnar  Circle Khador  Menoth  anyone I forgot Retribution = Skorne.

I'm not sure why, but I can't stand the look of Skorne or Ret.  




 [Here's](http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/2jd60t/songs_turned_into_story_arcs/) some stuff people said about this before if you want to see some more ideas. 




 What about Sheik? 




 If I'm the one deciding, it's rolling. If it's other people, it seems the decision is always to take the number, or max, or max+whateverittakestosaveasnowflake. 




 He clearly said a [galleon](https://quidleyandco.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/goldengalleonx578.jpg) of fuel. 




 That's what DMs are for. 




 The "retro" of retro-futurism means not current. I would say that 2012 is pretty current. We have retro-futurism for the 90s and early 2000s, it looks like [this](http://cdn-static.denofgeek.com/sites/denofgeek/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/the_matrix.jpg?itok=omHlubMU). The problem is, we haven't really gotten to the "future" of those things yet.

Basically, things from those times are just considered futurism, not retro-futurism. 




 I'll take a crack at this. 

Retro-futurism is less about the progression of time since the piece of media was created, and more about the change in mindset, worldview, and aesthetic from what originally spawned it. 
 




 It's a bit like masturbation. You only really want to do it if you don't have the time/money/charm to get the real thing. 




 Triple ick. Not only am I changing werewolf vulnerability, I think I'm going to stop using silver in my games.... and probably remove any from my house. 




 So, it kills werewolves because it's god-sperm? Ick. 




 I really hope Hero Forge doesn't become the "you should use Fate" of minis. 

While it is neat to be able to pick out different combinations of things for a mini, most of those combinations already exist in mini form, for a lot less money, and both less fragile and better to be painted (or repainted).  




 I actually mean it as both an insult and half a compliment. 

On the one hand, they should have taken the 4e rules and inserted them directly into a D D MMO without making a single change, and it probably would have been one of the greatest MMOs ever made. Instead they made Neverwinter, which was so half-assed, it was quarter-assed.

On the other hand, I have played so many rpgs, wargames, and board games, and yet none are as disappointing as 4e. Thing is, it's well designed. The problem is, it's only well designed *to be well designed*. Absolutely nothing it did translated to fun at the table for me. 




 I'm going to assume you've never played a wargame, and never actually talked to an older player. 

The first edition of D D was based on wargames. Older players were playing wargames before rpgs even existed. There are lots of really great wargames made into RPGs that don't play like 4e, and they literally just add skills checks to wargame rules.

4e is nothing like a wargame, and is everything like World of Warcraft the board game. 

Sad thing is, I am a lover of RPGs, wargames, board games, and World of Warcraft, and I still can't stand 4e. 




 I love to play tactical wargames. In fact, I've used tactical wargame rules to run rpgs. The original D D was based on a wargame. 

Saying 4e is like a tactical wargame hurts me to my very wargamey soul.

4e is like a complicated board game is soooooooooooo much more accurate, and it doesn't burn the flesh off my ears when I hear it. 




 A lot of people are recommending Stars Without Number and... that's because it's awesome. And free. Go check it out. 




 So meta... 




 Wtf do you think we are talking about? Lesser evil is evil. It's literally *part of the term*. Lesser evil. Lesser. Evil. Two things are evil, one is less evil. The first part of that statement means that both are evil because it explicitly states that it is evil. 

Let me know how the "But at least I didn't do ______, which is sooooo much worse." argument works out for you. 




 The United States commits evil acts all the time, and is the victor. Just because you win doesn't mean you get to change the nature of what evil is.

If I murder everyone in the world, is it not evil, since there is no one left to say otherwise?

Even after human beings go extinct, the evil that has been done, whether known by all or by none, will still be evil. 




 Chaotic Evil societies wouldn't have a problem with slaves. Sure, they don't have laws telling you you can own slaves, but they don't have laws telling you you can't either. They probably aren't going to have a system of laws and regulations on slavery, but Chaotic Evil people will keep as many slaves as they can keep under their control. 

It's less "I bought this slave, have the town guard bring him back" and more "You are going to work for me, and if you do well enough, I won't eat you today." 




 Just because a paladin wouldn't immediately start a revolution in a state where slavery was permitted doesn't mean he thinks it's okay. 




 Laws are always good, right? This on a topic about a game that specifically has Lawful Evil as a thing. 

Early America had slaves, and everyone was totally cool with it. It's not like they [fought a full-blown war with themselves about it or anything](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War). 

"The bible says it's okay, so it must not be evil". I'm going to catch flak for this, I'm sure, but the Judeo-christian god would be Lawful Neutral, at best. Read the crazy shit it says you should be doing in Leviticus. 

And I suppose you think Nazis were pretty okay, right? I mean, they didn't even break any laws.  




 Don't worry, they made an [entire edition of D D](http://www.amazon.com/Dungeons-Dragons-Core-Rulebook-Edition/dp/0786950633) based on WoW style gameplay. 




 What a strange name for a kid... parents must be nerds. 




 The first [Reaper Bones Kickstarter Vampire level set](http://www.reapermini.com/kickstarter) is on [eBay](http://www.ebay.com/itm/2012-BONES-VAMPIRE-SET-REAPER-MINIATURES-/311244114620?pt=Games_US hash=item4877984abc) all the time for about $250. That's about $1 per mini. 




 Now *that* word is ruined for me. Way to go.

*It puts the lotion in the basket* 




 The first isn't wrong, it's just less clear. The second isn't pointless at all.  Saying any of it is part of having a discussion about the merits of using a particular system.

Games aren't made utter shit just because there is a rule in it that sucks. What's your favorite system? I guarantee it has problems. I guess you absolutely never recommend it to anyone. Since it has problems, it's pointless to talk about how you like it anyway, and how you work around those problems, right? God forbid someone have fun in a way you don't approve of.

Jumping on people for not wording things exactly the way you want is pretty shitty. Wanting to argue semantics instead of having a polite conversation about things people are interested in is pretty shitty.  




 The $299.95 isn't for the limited edition variant cover version. It's for the pack of 5 books that a store can order, one of which will be a limited edition variant cover. Talk to you FLGS guy and see if they are getting it, and see if you can call dibs on the variant cover. It should cost the same as the normal books. 




 You know what bothers me? 

"There is no issue with ________ because of rule 0." 

and "I have no issue with ______ because of of rule 0." 

technically mean different things, but people can't just assume the person means the one that doesn't involve a logic argument and move on with their life.  




 I don't know... but the word "reflesh" is really freakin me out right now. 




 [Here you go.](http://icv2.com/articles/news/view/30589/iron-kingdoms-unleashed-corebook-scheduled) 




 It's a shame it's only in Polish. I've played Neuroshima Hex, and it was pretty interesting. I'd buy a ttrpg from them if it was in English. 




 I don't see where he said it was an RPG.

Having played it, I don't really know what the difference would be. Potato / potato. 




 This.

It's also worth noting that they designed the classes without expectation that players will have magic items. 




 I didn't realize women had "junk" up front. 




 I agree. Just plan the games to be shorter, and if everyone is still into it at the end (including you), just keep it going. 




 I gotta ask, how does Gamma World do more to encourage roleplaing than Iron Kingoms?

I agree, though, that it's probably perfect for OP. 
























 What *is* popularity? Does it accurately show the preferences of people who have been on rpggeek.com who were arsed enough to vote? Close enough. Does it accurately represent what rpgs are played most around the world? No. Does it accurately represent what rpgs people *want* to play around the world? No. Does it accurately represent how much money is being spent on each game? No. Does it accurately represent what games someone could expect to see being played if they walked in to a random gaming store? No. Does it accurately represent what you would see being played if you walked into a random gamer's house on game night? No. 

In fact, every single one of those questions would have a different ranking. All being "correct", and yet all being different, despite representing the same basic thing. Without a goal, the data has no meaning. With a goal, the data has a bias. Decide which way you want to be wrong. 

I can actually give you a *real* answer though. D D5e is doing really well, and is *mostly* replacing all other forms of D D for a large majority of people who like D D. Mostly because it is new, and is "good enough" to not piss people off. Hype isn't really a major driving force in its success. It is not better or worse than Dungeon World. They are also not mutually exclusive. There are people who like both, people who like one and not the other, and people who don't like either. None of those people are wrong. 




 I generally think these lists are garbage, and don't really think they represent anything accurately (I know way too much about data collection/interpretation). 

However, seeing Pathfinder all the way down at 33 brings a tear of joy to my eye, and so god bless this list for that. 




 Here are some of my favorites:

[Deadzone](http://www.manticgames.com/games/deadzone.html) (kickstarter for new stuff [here](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1744629938/deadzone-infestation-sci-fi-skirmish-game) ): Miniatures skirmish wargame. I'm not going to list all the wargames I like, but this one not only has a pretty low buy in, but also uses a pretty small table space (relatively), and has super cool terrain bits.

[Zombicide](http://zombicide.com/en/): Cooperative miniatures strategy game where you play as people trying to survive a zombie apocalypse. 

[Mars Attacks](http://www.manticgames.com/games/mars-attacks-the-miniatures-game.html): Miniatures game based on the movie (sorta). Can actually be combined with Deadzone, funnily enough.

[Netrunner](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/android-netrunner-the-card-game/): Cyberpunk card game. 




 Exactly what I thought when I saw it. I'd watch that movie though. 




 Each box is full of staples that you will most likely use in many lists for that army, and jacks/beasts that can be magnetized. 

I've been playing Warmachine for a few years, with an army of some size for at least half the factions, and these boxes are such a great deal that I have bought/pre-ordered every single one. For some of the boxes I already have some of the units (like bane thralls, gun mages, choir, etc), but the box is still a good deal even if I just threw those models in the garbage (except Cygnar, where it's only an okay deal if I throw the doubles in the garbage). If I can use two, I'm going to keep them, but a lot of them I'm going to give away to some people I'm trying to get into the hobby.

Keep in mind though, I got mine at about $97, so ymmv. I did the math though, and even if you are paying the full retail of $130, you are still getting a good deal (assuming you need the models). Cygnar is probably the least good deal (discount-wise), as you could buy everything that comes in the box individually (minus the mini-rulebook, another nice bonus to the box) for about $140 from somewhere like discountgamesstore. Skorne *was* probably the best (I don't even like Skorne and I had to have it). 




 I add Fate to just about every game I run. 5e is pretty easy. Anything true about a character works like an Aspect (all the things in their racial description and background, for instance), and just bump the number of Inspiration points they can have at a time to 3 (they are now Fate points, but you don't have to tell them that). Reward them like you would Fate points, and tell them they can use them to take advantage of "aspects" of their character. 

Games I've done this successfully with: Paranoia, Iron Kingdoms, Stars Without Number, Gamma World, Rogue Trader, D D5e, Shadowrun, and Numenera.

Funny thing is, I've never ran a Fate game on its own, and I haven't liked any of the Fate games I've played in. I technically don't like Fate by itself. Really I just hate the "well, how about you word it *this* way, that would make it a better Aspect" thing that happens, it makes you sound like an ass, and it makes people not used to that kind of game hate the game. Sometimes crappy aspects are perfectly fine, especially when you are just starting out. 




 I definitely start low and ramp up higher as the group gets used to my style of GMing (and the game system, if they are new to it). I would say I start in the 2-3 range, and end in the 7-10 range. It's a bigger range at the top, because I don't ever have just one option for success. 

1 group in 100 might do *everything* right, but most are going to have to make tough choices about what gets done well. Groups that don't care usually have everything go wrong, with maybe one thing working out in a way that isn't a complete disaster.  




 [Space bard in action.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRYNYb30nxU) 




 I started with Mercs (bought a full Searforge army right off the bat) and I don't regret it at all. I can't say it's for everyone, but it's served me well.  




 Models acquired this way will stare at their owner with judging eyes all the time. They also will make every win they have taste bitter with shame, and losses all the more crushing served with a side order of guilt. 




 A dark wash and some highlighting would really help bring out the details, but I love the color choices. 

I'm just kidding, she's four. Great job!

Thin your paints... or something. 




 I would have pegged the Prince of Persia as a GURPS man. And you think you know a person... 




 There is an official alternative option for initiative in the DMG that is basically this. I do it often in more narrative focused games. 




 Sounds like fun. 

I've been running games since 1996, and I still get nervous when I start a new campaign. You'll get past that and to the fun fast enough. 




 Best of luck to you. There is some serious hate for GMs for hire, which is crazy. I think it's great, and in fact, when I stop blowing all my money on miniatures, I might hit you up (don't hold your breath though, wargaming addiction is a tough habit to kick). 




 Not only is it not copyrightable, if it was, your idea would probably be taken. Dice have been around for thousands of years, and even just in the last decade there have been probably a thousand games with different dice mechanics. 

The good news? No one is going to steal your idea. Ideas are cheap, and common. Even the good ones. The work you put into an idea is what you sell, because that's what is worth something. 

Bad news: No one cares about your "unique" idea. There are thousands of people with dreams and ideas that think about how cool it is that they had this nifty idea. Very few actually put in the blood, sweat, tears, time, and financial backing to make those ideas into something that other people can appreciate. 

Best of luck to you though.

 I had an idea in middle school for running an rpg campaign where the races were different kinds of food. Human's were burgers, halflings were sliders, gnomes were hot dogs, orcs were bbq ribs, elves were I think tacos, dwarves were pizza, half-orcs were pulled pork sandwiches, and half-elves were burritos. Pretty sure it hasn't been done yet, and I'm pretty sure it was about 10 minutes before lunch time when I thought of it. Speaking of, is it too late for dinner, or too early for breakfast? 




 Yep. I haven't run a full game of it yet, but it has a pretty good "job" generator section that's pretty good. Made by the same people who made the most recent Firefly rpg, and it apparently uses the same engine. 




 I've never played the Payday games, but there is an [RPG based on the TV show Leverage](http://www.margaretweis.com/index.php/shop#!/~/product/id=9555048). 




 [Not helpful, but relevant.](http://oglaf.com/kingshaped/) 




 I'm just curious, in what way did you think it was limited? 




 *edit: My science is bad and I feel bad.  




 Utter rubbish. What textbook did you get that out of? One from the 70s? You might want to try a more recent one, one not written by racists.  




 I feel bad for non-American cultures when aliens get here firing lasers. They just won't know what hit'em. 




 My favorites: 

The Infinite Improbability Drive from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

The BTL or "Better Than Light" Drive from Spaceship Zero.

Warhammer40k's Warp (basically the same as Event Horizon).

The space travel from the Ender's Game series. This one is basically just a ship that travels really fast, but because it approaches the speed of light, time slows down for the people on the ship, but not for people who aren't traveling. Which means it seems like a 1 year trip to you, if you are the one travelling, but it might take you 20 years to get there.  




 [This](http://www.artplaymix.com/portfolio/paizo_hijinx-mag1.gif) was a thing. Might not be what you are looking for, but if you want to check it out, it's for sale [here](http://paizo.com/products/btpy7z7f?Dungeon-Issue-99-with-Polyhedron-158). 




 I just picked up the All-in-one box for Legion. I saw I have the option between the two Strider units, and I thought I'd see which I should assemble them as. I have zero other legion.

I'm looking to eventually get p/eAbsylonia, pLylyth, and eThagrosh if that helps.

*edit: Also, what's the best way to do 15pt using the All-in-One box? 




 It's just a starter adventure and pre-mades for the new Unleashed book. It's the same as what's in the adventure kit, except digital. Map tiles / minis not included.

 If only it was for something other than Pathfinder. 




 If they are souls in mechanikal bodies, with full human intelligence (something jacks don't really have), you might want to look at the Convergence of Cyriss Clockwork Vessel stuff for the IKRPG in No Quarter #48.  




 I was just thinking about this again today, and I think I'd settle for having a Searforge Junior Warcaster. Preferably female.

If she had 3 focus, she could run two bunnies and have 1 upkeep going. 




 [This is a great idea. I'm so glad I thought of it.](http://i.imgur.com/snLplqq.jpg) 




 If it's just paint by numbers, the person who said that must be able to do [this](http://www.coolminiornot.com/), right?

 Ooze wall is good. Crawling Ooze Wall sounds perfect to me.  




 Your second theory has been my theory since I first heard about this.

Every pusher in the world knows to make the first hit free. 
























 Bronze Age low fantasy? 




 do gritty near-future sci fi next. 




 Yep, that's pretty crunchy. 

What you can do, is play a one-shot in Fate, or AW/DW. Then when you go to Traveller, it'll feel plenty crunchy.

Fate is absolutely not crunchy enough for me. Every time I've played it, I've disliked it. However, I use the rules from Fate to lighten up more crunchy games, and I actually love some of the concepts in it.

If you are looking for crunchy, I highly recommend Iron Kingdoms RPG, or any of the Warhammer40k Roleplay games (my favorite is Rogue Trader, but it's definitely not everyone's favorite). Rogue Trader could actually probably serve you pretty well for whatever you were planning to do with Traveller, too. 




 I think Numenera is the crunchiest of the rules-light games. 

I add rules from Numenera to Fate Core to increase the level of crunch. And walnuts for chocolate chip cookies. 




 I am super curious as to what you normally play, and what you consider to be complex. 




 Warlock is a starting career, and you essentially take all your starting classes *at the same time*. A starting character Bloodweaver/Circle Warlock would start with an ARC of 2 unless you raise it with your stat increases. 




 I expect we will see these exact same boxes again. They used them to boost interest in the game and get people into new factions, and they will probably let that ride for a while. In a year or two, if they have a bit of a slump (or even if they suspect one), they will probably do another limited release of these same boxes. They don't need to do new stuff in the boxes because the majority of people didn't buy every box they would ever want, and it still presents the same value to new players. Also, these boxes were very much "core" lists, with almost no overlap with battleboxes.  




 If you can get a hold of one of the all-in-one army boxes, those are a great start. 




 The pyschologists probably noticed it right away. 




 I think that's a perfectly fine idea. 

If it was me (and I may do this if I buy him, since I run pirates all the time), I'd see if I could just cut his hat off, and sculpt a tricorn out of green stuff. Then you could just paint him with a "piratey" theme and he'd be good to go.

There's seriously as many ways to do it as there are people who could do it. 
 




 I'm going to second Iron Kingdoms. It can handle extremely tactical combat, and has probably the fastest combats of the rules heavy games out there. 

You can check it out for free [here](http://files.privateerpress.com/ironkingdoms/documents/adventures/IKRPG_Scenario_Fools_Rush_In.pdf) and [here](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/146332/Iron-Kingdoms-Unleashed-An-Introduction-to-Savagery).

 It's by far my favorite non-narrative style combat system. 




 Are you looking for a tournament legal conversion? If so, that's going to be hard to get it looking like the exclusive one, as you need 50%+ of the original model, and they are actually quite a bit different (the only thing that's really even similar is the gas mask and the grenades). 

Now, if you aren't worried about it being tourney legal, it's not at all hard to put a gas mask on a pirate mini and give him a few grenades.

It all depends on what you are looking for.

*edit: If all you are looking for is the normal gorman mini with a pirate hat, that's pretty easy to do. 




 I like them, but I prefer to get them randomly. 




 check out /r/LFG 

It's a subreddit specifically for finding games to play in, and it isn't half bad. 




 Technically you are both right. For the sake of the fact that he's the one who used the word first, based on his definition, your system is not balanced. There is nothing wrong with that if that's what you like. 

Some people think games need to be balanced in certain ways, others don't. Some people like point buy, some people like randomly rolled. It's just a preference thing.

Basically, there are two types of one-armed men. One type will insist you tie one of your hands behind your back to make it a fair fight (and will usually still bitch about fairness if they lose, and generally cry some more like a little baby). The other type will kick your ass with just his one arm, and be all the more of a badass for it.

Personally, I think the kind of balance he is talking about makes for a terrible game (D D4e, looking at you here). That kind of balance really only matters in competitive adversarial games. Which to me, aren't roleplaying games. GMs aren't the bad guy, they just decide what the bad guy does. The other players aren't your competition, they are your friends. Or at least, that's how I roll.

Your game sounds like fun, and already I'm interested in hearing more. 




 Or maybe a sword with, like, [a chainsaw along one edge](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/warhammer40k/images/2/2d/Titus_Chainsword.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130613180716). 




 Wow, someone beat me to an IKRPG recommendation. I'm impressed.

Here's some free quickstart guides for IKRPG: [here](http://files.privateerpress.com/ironkingdoms/documents/adventures/IKRPG_Scenario_Fools_Rush_In.pdf) and [here](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/146332/Iron-Kingdoms-Unleashed-An-Introduction-to-Savagery) 




 [This](http://privateerpress.com/iron-kingdoms/introduction-to-the-iron-kingdoms) is a pretty decent way to get started. Or if you are more of a visual learner [this](http://www.deviantart.com/browse/all/?q=warmachine+iron+kingdoms offset=0) or [this](https://www.google.com/search?q=warmachine+iron+kingdoms biw=1329 bih=927 source=lnms tbm=isch sa=X ei=vioxVfzAGc62yASj74DoCQ ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ) might be better. [This](http://ironkingdoms.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page) isn't terrible, but there's not much there. 




 Every game has it's problems. IKRPG wins out for me because of how fast combat goes in such a tactical crunchy-rules game.  




 I skipped any that had already been mentioned, especially if I don't have a lot of experience with them. Namely, hackmaster, rolemaster, and gurps. 




 You rang? 

I love complex games. I like having rules for everything, and then just ignoring them if I don't need them at the moment. 

[Iron Kingdoms RPG](http://privateerpress.com/iron-kingdoms/core-products/iron-kingdoms-core-rules) is a great complex game (quick start rules [here](http://files.privateerpress.com/ironkingdoms/documents/adventures/IKRPG_Scenario_Fools_Rush_In.pdf) and [here](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/146332/Iron-Kingdoms-Unleashed-An-Introduction-to-Savagery)). It is built from the Warmachine wargame rules (which was built from D D3e). When I run a fantasy game, I run IKRPG. One of the things that it does well over a lot of other complex games is that combat is still really quick (mostly because nothing lives past 2 or 3 rounds). It's a dynamic and deadly system that is great for people who love strategy who want a great fantasy game. Also, the new standalone expansion has probably the [best starter box of all time](http://privateerpress.com/iron-kingdoms/core-products/iron-kingdoms-unleashed-adventure-kit). 

Another great complex game is the **Warhammer40k Roleplay** series (*Dark Haresy II* is newest, though my favorite is still *Rogue Trader*). The WH40k universe is so rich and complex that it really needs a complex rules system to do it justice. Hundreds and hundreds of weapon and armor options, table after table after table of injury results, hundreds of spaceship options, dozens of character origin options, a robust skill list... there is enough crunch here to choke a heretic. It's a little rigid, and I have some home-rules that loosen it up a bit, but it also has the structure of a wargame for its roots, and combat is deliciously strategic, deadly, and lots of fun. Combats tend to be longer than IKRPG games, and that's something that is pretty common with complex games, but it's not horrible, and they are definitely fun and interesting combats, with lots of options. 

**Dungeons and Dragons** has two editions that I would count as complex, 3.5/PF and 4e. For me, they both have the same problem, and that is that combat takes too long, and gets pretty boring. There are other things I could say about them, but I'm not going to fight an Edition Wars battle here.

*Special mention*: There are several games that I actually don't think are very complex, but that are somewhat tricky to learn. Mostly you just need someone who already knows how to play to run it for you, but it's still enough to get mentioned.

**Eclipse Phase**: Great setting, strangely complex (and maybe just a smidge poorly organized) rules. Available for free, which means you can check it out before you invest.

new **Star Wars** (Edge of the Empire, etc.): I actually consider the system itself to be pretty simple, but the dice are kind of crazy. All the complexity lies in interpreting the funky dice, which allows the game to play like a rules-lite game. 

**Burning Wheel**: I can't even say much (I just can't even). I bought the book, tried to understand it, and I can't do it. It's complex, but not in any way that any other game is. I don't even know. From what I've heard, it's actually really good though.

**Savage Worlds**: This is deceptively complex. It tries to pretend like it's a simple game, but it has so many different options and bits and pieces and moving parts that it's hard to take it all in at first. Great system though, and it can really play any style of "high action" pulpy sort of game. I'll always have it just for *Deadlands*.

**BRP**, **CoC**, **RQ**, etc: I've played a few of these games, and they are are pretty complex, but they make so much sense that it doesn't take much to learn them. CoC is probably the most popular of them all. 

edited for formatting

edit2: 
**Super Special Bonus Round!**
I forgot to mention **Mutants   Masterminds**. Hundreds and hundreds of options that allow you to custom design any imaginable character. On top of that, the combat rules are at least as complex as any d20 game. 

also **Shadowrun**. Very complex, and it works well for the setting.  




 Usually after the first few times they mess up, and suffer the consequences, they get the idea. If not, they just aren't going to get it, and you may as well plan accordingly. 




 In the theme of recommending you buy stuff that comes with minis instead of buying minis by themselves, I highly recommend the new [Iron Kingdoms Unleashed Adventure Kit](http://privateerpress.com/iron-kingdoms/core-products/iron-kingdoms-unleashed-adventure-kit). You can get it for about $35, and it has 14 minis, which makes them about $2.50 each.

Also, 

Unfortunately I don't have any friends to play wargames with...

hit me right in the feels, whydontcha? I highly recommend going to your local gaming store (sometimes they are disguised as comic book stores). If you ask, they probably have a night during the week where they do tabletop games (even if it's just Pathfinder or D D5e). Once you find your local wargamers, you can let them know you want to start playing, and they'll try to push their product on you. 




 I'll recommend Stars Without Number for you. It's simple, can use a grid well, and has a lot of amazing features that you won't find elsewhere. 

Also, a possible good stepping stone into tabletop games would be some wargames. Something like [Deadzone](http://www.manticgames.com/games/deadzone.html) would be a great way to get used to playing tabletops, and you could go from there to something like Stars Without Number. Plus then you get to use all those great minis and terrain for your rpg!  




 [Some potential inspiration](https://miniarmyhugetimesink.wordpress.com/2015/02/09/holy-rusted-metal/) for you. 




 Not only that, but we have probably the [single best starter box ever made now.](http://privateerpress.com/iron-kingdoms/core-products/iron-kingdoms-unleashed-adventure-kit) 




 I use them, but I put foam in them. They aren't bad, but it's a really decent cheap option. 




 I was like, "Why would anyone want to go through all that hassle just to say the characters are eating and sleeping?", but then I saw the "GURPS" tag, and I needed no further explanation. 




 Have you seen the Cypher system of Numenera/The Strange? That's almost exactly what you just described. 




 I get to imagine a world. A special place I've created in my mind. Unlike writing about it, where you can let people *see* your world, you actually let people *be* in your world. They can interact with it, respond to it, and change it. It becomes something more because of their contribution. Together, you become a story-telling team. Their lives in your world will live on in all your memories. 

It becomes real. The judgments you make will define the laws of your world. The more consistent you are, the more it will become a real place in the players mind, and not just decoration draped over a dice game. 

You are also the conduit of fun for the group. Through you, fighting and arguing turns into adventure. You can turn sadness and bitterness into growth. Selfishness and spite become mystery. You can make the weak feel strong, and the ordinary feel extraordinary. You can make people fear or hope, laugh or cry. 

Basically, everyone should try it so they can feel [like a boss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NisCkxU544c). 




 Also, before anyone else beats me to it, I want to play [Devil's advocate](http://imgur.com/gallery/9Huvs) a minute. 

It's the GM's job to keep the game world consistent. Part of that job is making judgement calls on what the player's can and can't do (or what their odds are). They aren't perfect, and they are trying to weigh their decision based on the written rules (written by some other imperfect schmuck), the desires of each player (each one probably different from the other), his understanding of physics (not even real physics, but fake physics), his personal preferences, and his (probably constantly changing) vision of an imaginary world. It's a lot of responsibility, and he probably deserves some slack. Not all the calls he makes are going to be the right ones. If he's not making them the way you'd like them enough for you to have fun, then just don't play in his game, and try to find someone who does. Always feel free to discuss your opinion with your GM, though (though sometimes you should wait till after the game).

Basically, this post is advice for the player, the first post is advice for the GM.  




 I've had one or two try, but in a game where how well you do is based on how cool/fun what you are trying to do is, there's not really any need (or benefit) from trying to "game the system". Honestly I can't think of anyone who successfully "got one over on me" or anything like that, and I've played with some crafty (read: pain-in-the-ass) players.

edit: I will say though, it does take a bit of trust between me and my players. I don't have them keep track of things like inventory or ammunition, which lets them have what they need when they need it... until they don't. Basically when I think it'd be cool/fun to have their shit *not* work, I get the same ability to say "You are out of bullets" or "They've traced your call, and you're not sure how". I don't use things like, "You, a highly trained spy, was a total idiot and butt dialed them using your real phone" though, everything I say and decision I make has a reason. If it's likely you used a burner phone, and they tracked you down anyway, there is [something fucky going on](http://imgur.com/r/gifs/IgU4Y), like they have a mole in your group, or they have a super-hacker with ties to the NSA, or they slipped a tracker or bug on your while you were there.  




 I force my players to do this, and I do it all the time, with no limits and no checks. I get tired of great ideas thrown out because someone didn't think of it on the spot. Especially with people newer to gaming, but even with old pros. That's how you get games where people decide what to do based on what's on their sheet (I attack the guy with my sword), instead of doing what roleplaying is all about (I throw my sword at the rope holding the chandelier before jumping onto and riding it into the three guys on the floor below). 

To the asshole GMs who are like, "Should have thought of that before" "That's lazy roleplaying" "Blah, blah, blah", guess what? You aren't perfect. *It is 10000% impossible for you to convey every detail of your fictional world to them all time.* They don't have the advantage that their characters have of actually being there. I'm going to blindfold you, put earplugs in your ears, plug your nose, and shoot you full of drugs before throwing you in an unfamiliar foreign country. We'll see how well you do. They can't see, they can't hear, they can't smell, taste, touch, or anything of your world. All they can do is ask you what's there, and imagine it based on your shit description. And yeah, your description is shit. If it wasn't, you'd be so busy making millions off your best selling novels you wouldn't have time for gaming anymore. 

*All of that*, and I haven't even mentioned the fact that people are not their characters yet (don't worry, I'm about to). I am not a spy. I am not a warrior. I am not a wizard. I am not a hacker. I am not a rogue. Unless I am playing a damn fine looking tabletop gamer, or a charming anthropologist, I am not my fucking khakis (I mean characters). *Excuuuuuuuuse me* if I don't think of something a *real* spy would think of *before* I'm even in a situation they might be in (while having only the very limited knowledge of what's going on of being completely blind/deaf/numb with only your pretty vague description to help me out). 

Come on, son. 




 Wrong community, mate. 




 I don't know. I've been here a while, and it's honestly like we all have what we need. There are just a handful of unclear/confusing rules, and once those are cleared up people can just play. 

Weekly posts would be pretty cool, I think. Statting out Warmachine/Hordes stuff probably is less productive than the other idea though.

*edited to make my sentence make sense. 




 You *say* "Pathfinder", but I'm just going to pretend you are saying IKRPG.

Nice painting. 




 Ha ha, this from the guy who's arguing semantics about a board game.  




 Ageist. 

Lol, j/k. You kids have fun. 




 Homebrew is just another word for home-made.

What you meant to say, was how you don't get why they are saying "game", when they mean "setting", since they could very easily have used the term "home-made" instead of "homebrew" and it wouldn't have changed anything.

To that, [you are kinda right](http://i.imgur.com/40Idny0.png). Except that "homebrew game" can mean a game that **is** homebrew, *or* it could mean a game that **contains** homebrew, or even just a game loosely associated with homebrew.

There is no need to "qualify" as a homebrew game, because there isn't an RPG Association that we pay dues to that will cite us for improperly labeling our games (if you *do* run such an organization, then I'm wrong, and you should have mentioned it in your post). Don't use being a grognard as an excuse to be an elitist prick. It makes the rest of the old guard look bad.
 




 Let's not forget [First Mate Hawk](http://battlecollege.wikispaces.com/mkiihawk) who gives them (essentially) fearless and weapon master, and then their banker? [Lord Rockbottom](http://battlecollege.wikispaces.com/mkiirockbottom), gives them a bunch of great stuff.  




 Not only do I not use music, I usually get annoyed whenever someone else does. It rarely adds much to the ambiance, and usually ends up making it hard to hear what people are saying. The only time I thought it worked okay was when someone put on the sound of a crackling fire when we were in a tavern.  
























 Of all the places I've heard that word, I've heard it the most in Texas. 




 Used to be, not anymore, unfortunately.  




 Thanks. 

I'm super excited. It looks amazing (I've been watching all the play through videos I can find), and I can't wait to try it out. 




 If I take your capitalization to indicate punctuation... you're in the wrong subreddit. 

/R/RPG is for tabletop games. /R/Games might be what you are looking for. 




 It could be both. If people keep coming back and playing in your games, you are probably a pretty good GM. However, it does take a certain kind of trusting relationship (or not giving a shit) to give feedback to someone else. 

The only time I've gotten feedback was from assholes or best friends, never in between. 









 Numenera has a list of mutations that might work pretty well for you. They range from purely cosmetic to actual mechanical benefits. It would kinda give the setting an interesting WH40k feel, with psionics "warping" the user. 




 I forget who, and I forget what for (I kind of think it was Cards Against Humanity), but a company did an anti-sale, charging more than ever for the product for a limited time. It sold, but they were weirdos to begin with. 




 If you watch the "first look" video, you can see the new sculpts being used with or alongside standard PP bases. 

I don't personally own a WM Monstrosity, but he's probably an exception. He'll still probably be on a 40 or 50mm base. 




 Not going to happen. Honestly, even 20 years from now I doubt they will change it. 

You'll know it's coming if they do though, because Warmachine MK3 will have been out for probably like five years. MK3 is probably a good 10 to 15 years from happening (if ever), so you've got time.

As for a reprint, maybe? But the errata is what? One page? They aren't like a lot of companies that have entire books of errata and clarifications. 
 




 I will probably be able to get this with at least a 20% off retail discount. That means that if there was nothing in the box but the figures, it'd be about $1.73 per figure, which is a steal. Add on the fact that the map tiles are probably the same great quality as the IKRPG:U Adventure Kit, that's bonus. With a simple quick game to introduce people to the rpg, too? I'm probably going to buy several and give them away as gifts. 




 I don't see any reason why they wouldn't be. [They look](http://privateerpress.com/iron-kingdoms/board-games/the-undercity) like they are probably going to be the same material and size as the IKRPG Unleashed Adventure Kit figures, which are the same size as WarmaHordes figs. 

Also, they would have to be complete morons to pay for *new* sculpts that look **exactly** like sculpts they already have, except smaller/larger. It would take a lot of money for no reason. 

Not to mention the fact that they are probably *trying* to make this the equivalent of the Adventure Kit for Full Metal Fantasy. 









 Gorten would destroy everyone if he had more than what he has now.  




 There's a difference between accepting it because you don't think it's about actually worshiping demons, and accepting it because you know it's not just a bunch of filthy nerds running around in the woods throwing nerf-balls at each other. The first one is much more common than the second one, but geeks and gamers are becoming more and more accepted in society. *Age of the geek, baby.*

Also, I don't know if this has anything to do with it, but the USA is a huge landmass. The state I live in is bigger than the country you live in. There are areas where it is accepted, and areas where it is less so. In fact, I generally drive between 25 to 50 miles (40 to 80 km, I think) to game. Maybe one of your neighbor countries has all the gamers.  




 Honestly, it's the same game. It's really down to whether you want to be humans and warcasters with warjacks, or whether you want to be trolls and warlocks with warbeasts.

There is a [really great starter kit](http://privateerpress.com/iron-kingdoms/core-products/iron-kingdoms-unleashed-adventure-kit) for Unleashed though, so that might be a decent place to start. 




 Iron Kingdoms "classic" is generally referred to as Iron Kindoms Full Metal Fantasy (FMF).

IKRPG:FMF and IKRPG:U are both standalone games, and if you buy one, you don't need to buy they other. However, the rules from both are fully compatible, and you could use things from one book in the other. 

IKRPG:FMF focuses on the civilizations and city-dwellers of Iron Kingdoms, especially the human nations. IKRPG:U focuses on the wilds of Iron Kingdoms, and the more tribal people who live in them. 

This version of IKRPG (there was one before that was based on D D3e) is adapted from the rules of the wargame, Warmachine/Hordes. 

IKRPG:FMF is to Warmachine as IKRPG:U is to Hordes (essentially).

edit: Oh, as to which to buy, I own both, and you should too. However, if you only get one, pick the one that fits the games you want to play; IKRPG:FMF for giant metal robots and espionage, IKRPG:U for giant beasties and eating people.  




 You mean like [this](https://onlinedm.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/greenleaf_two_pages.jpg)? If you get the miniatures that were being released during that edition they even had cards for monsters like [this](http://mfi.re/imgbnc.php/d3b81cbac8980942ac3bb3e0e8b3c1a94g.jpg). 

My recommendation: Don't do it. Play a simpler version of it, like D D5e. It's especially easy to learn if you don't use the optional rules, like feats.  




 I understand what you are saying, but only barely. Your post is a mess, and you keep going back and forth talking about mechanics and story.

Even if you are just playing one game, then switching to a completely different game, it still probably won't work. If your players aren't familiar with the systems you are using, they aren't going to be able to have much fun, as soon as they figure out how the system works, you'll be changing to a different one. Not only that, but you had better be planning on providing pre-mades, since you'll need different character stats for each game, and character creation eats up a lot of time. Time that will be wasted, since they won't even be using those stats for long. 

Even if all your players are already familiar with all the systems you are using, and you've already got premades ready to go, I really doubt too many people are going to enjoy this, no matter what the story is. 

I actually think combining the best parts of several systems into one game is a better idea than this one.  




 I'm actually not sure where I got it now, but for wilderness terrain, all the map tiles for the IKRPG Unleashed Adventure Kit are available digitally for free. ~~I'm trying to find out from where, and I'll post a link if I do.~~ [Found it.](http://privateerpress.com/boostyourexperience) 




 Honestly, none that I've seen. There are a couple that exist, but none that have really caught my attention. 

The term originated with an rpg, Children of the Sun, but I haven't seen it around to check it out. 

I mean, unless you count Pulp stuff as Dieselpunk (I don't). Really it's like porn, you know it when you see it, but defining it is kind of difficult. There are plenty of Pulp games out there that are pretty good. Savage Worlds and Spirit of the Century come to mind. 

Thinking about it makes me want to work on my Dieselpunk setting again.  




 Dieselpunk is easily my favorite of the "punk" derivatives (technically Steampunk is also a derivative, the original is Cyberpunk), though there aren't many games that fit that style. 

One of my favorite published settings is Iron Kingdoms, which is solidly steampunk + magic.  




 I've used it for years now, and I've yet to find anything better for my needs. I've been running online games for close to a decade now, using lots of different tools like this, and this one is definitely the best for what I play.  




 Other than having mini-rule book to pass around, no.

That said, the minis and map tiles were worth the cost for me. Actually, the minis alone were worth it, and I didn't know how much I'd love the map tiles.

However, if you have tons of terrain and minis from Hordes, you don't really need it. 




 The problem with registries like that, is that it's hard to make them "essential" enough that anyone looking for a game goes to *that specific* registry. 

That said, I've had some luck with /r/lfg and meetup.com for finding local and online games. 




 Like other people, I tend to do TotM for short battles, and I get out mins and draw maps for bigger more intense battles. 

However, I do not use a grid. I will never again use a grid. The difference between using a grid and not is so enormous that I can never bring myself to use a grid again. Once players start counting squares, all creative options start to disappear. No one is jumping from balcony to balcony, no one is sliding, or tumbling, or wrestling, or anything even remotely resembling real combat anymore. They move in boring patterns, and any idea for combat that doesn't involve "move up and swing my sword" is gone. Never again. Not even once. 




 I think the Cypher system (Numenera/The Strange) is a great example of a good set damage system. A certain kind of weapon is going to do a certain kind of damage, but you have the option to boost the damage at a cost. There is also the option that you might have an exceptional weapon of that type that does more damage, and there are options for having a trade-off in damage for something else. All in all the system allows the players a great deal of predictability in the success or failure of their actions, and even though the system is on the simple side, this allows for a great deal of strategy. 




 First, having good relations with one segment of humans doesn't mean you trust humans as a whole. Being singular means those are the exceptions. 

How about this... you give me a reason for for each of the races to trust humans. Dwarves? Khadorans have tried to invade, and would do so again if they thought they had half a chance. Khadorans also cause problems with restricting their trade. Dwarves are the only ones I would even consider to be on good terms with humans, and I wouldn't really call it a "trust" based relationship. Nyss? Khadorans stole their freakin god. Humans also may (probably not, but no one can confirm either way) have something to do with why their god was dying in the first place. Plus, as refugees, I doubt they get treated like equals in common society. Gobbers? I don't think the humans' whipping boy is going to hold them in high regard. They may be a pathetic race of weasely little thieves, but that doesn't mean they like the boot that walks all over them. Trollkin? Hundreds (maybe thousands? I forget now) of years of strife, combined with the theft of their ancestral lands probably makes them a bit racist. 

But most of all, I like the idea of them being universally mistrusted, so they are. That's how running my own game works. If you don't want to play up how shitty humans are to non-humans, then don't.  




 It works fine for me. They might live among them, but I don't think that necessarily means they trust them. Also, just because you don't take a human at their word, doesn't mean you won't do what they say. In human lands, even if you don't like humans, they are still in charge.

In fact, I'll even double the penalty for creatures with mostly bad experiences with humans. 




 Only in Unleashed, but I'm definitely going to be adding it to my FMF characters. 




 Oh crap, I forgot. Since the book was released on stone tablets, there is no way to deviate from the rules as they are *literally* etched in stone.

Well, I guess he'll have to settle for games that are specifically designed for two players, since as a machine, he's completely incapable of independent thought or creativity.

Damn shame, too. Especially since Numenera *would* be my go to game for just two players if only I could make a decision for myself to, I don't know, give just one xp for intrusions instead of two, or something.

Oh well, *c'est la vie*, I suppose. 




 Well, the new Nyss bow has a -2 attack penalty, the old one didn't have one. Not that it matters for new Nyss, but it's there. 

The claymore likewise has a new penalty, and it also has an option to be wielded 1-handed option at 4 POW. 




 10g is not really a big deal, but then, I don't do bookkeeping the way some other people do.

*edit: also, keep in mind that the stats for the weapons are different in the new book too. 




 p.105:

Distrusted - Humans are poorly trusted by the denizens of the wild. As a result, human characters suffer a -1 on their non-Intimidation social rolls when dealing with characters of other races. 




 I love the penalty humans get.  




 I don't know what you mean by "just a tabletop site". You can type messages to everyone, or you can whisper people. I don't PBP, but not only could you leave shit in the chat, each campaign has their own mini-forum (which can be made available for public viewing, if you're into that kind of thing), and I'm sure that would cover most of your needs pretty well. 




 roll20.net just buffed up their mobile support *and* made it a free feature. 




 Any of the Cypher system games (Numenera, The Strange, and whatever else they've been cooking up) work great for this. It's very easy for a GM to scale encounters for one player. It's also very simple to let the player have helper npcs. In fact, GMing is so easy you will pretty much feel like you are just both playing. 

Also, maybe check out something like Cosmic Patrol. It does not require a GM. 




 In this vein, I'd say Numenera might qualify. 




 I don't remember where I read it (probably in the PP forum responses from Doug), but I'm pretty sure someone official said that a normal great coat is a lot of times incorporated into other armor types. It just doesn't do anything statistically. 




 Hah, I don't even have my players keep track of equipment. 

If it's likely that they have it, they have it. If I think them not having something they would normally have would make things more interesting, I offer them a bonus point (xp, feat, fate, w/e) for them to not have it. If it's something they aren't all that likely to have, they either don't have it, or they can give up a point (xp, feat, fate, w/e) to have it.

I just made equipment fun and easy for any system in three sentences. You are welcome, World.

*edited because I left out half a sentence. 
























 A "bardbarian", if you will. 




 A paladin named Might. Absolutely uncompromisingly good, to the point of wanting to redeem evil instead of destroy it. 

When the evil wizard summoned a pack of rust monsters to eat the metal supports of a dam near a small town, he rode valiantly to face them. After all his weapons and armor were eaten away, he continued punching the beasts in the face. They swarmed him, and pinned him down. Before they were able to subdue him, he grabbed hold of them and leapt from the top of the dam, saving the town at the cost of his own life.

There is a statue dedicated to him in the small town, and an entire tribe of goblins who honor him by being devout worshipers of Tyr. 




 I think it looks really good. I haven't had a chance to play/run it yet, but I have it downloaded to my tablet, and I'm sure I'll get to it eventually. 

I'm more likely to use a couple parts from it to run a space opera game using D D5e, though. 

As for that other version, it's probably the best thing to come out of D D4e. It still plays like 4e (unless you tear it apart, which I do if I run it), so I don't ever choose to play it over something else. 




 Some are definitely better than others. I would even say that there are very few that are genuinely more effective than not using one. I think having them is great, and I actually enjoy tournaments that have tier requirements, though they definitely favor people who are already playing one of those good tier lists. 

When I first started playing Warmachine, I would always play tiered lists as high as I could. I don't even know why, I just sort of thought that anything less was slacking. Now I pretty much never play tier lists unless I'm trying something crazy (Darius Field Tests t4), or if it's a requirement at a tournament.  




 I don't understand what you mean. I'm not even being a smart ass, I legitimately don't know what you are saying.

This is what I think you are saying:

"I want to smash down doors and kill everything with a big ax.

I make an old crippled wizard.

I attempt to smash doors and wield a big ax." 




 Not looking up rules during the game is one of the great improvements of 5e over other editions. The only time I really wish I had digital tools/books for it is character creation. 




 Think of the things you want to do in the game. 

~~Make a character that is good at those things.~~ 

Do those things.

edited: There, is that better? 




 I was just thinking, it'd be cool if this gave some suggestions for Warnouns within the different factions based on the answers. This would be especially helpful for highlighting casters in low percentage factions that don't normally fit the typical play style. 




 This is actually really cool. I mean, I own an army for almost every faction, and I can just change my army to fit my preference of the day, but for someone who doesn't know much about the game, who is looking for one faction to start with, this is actually really neat.

Thank you for making it. 




 I actually just ran a session of IKRPG today. It's my go-to game for rules heavy fast and deadly combat. 

There are a couple things that really make the system stand out for me (not to mention the amazing setting). One is the 2d6 dice method. It's a fairly predictable distribution, which allows players to reliably strategize, and the smaller range means that bonuses actually mean something. Someone who is strong will be able to reliably make strength based checks. 

Another thing is the two career set up. Even if you only were picking one career there are tons of choices. Having two choices *multiplies* that. When you add in the choices for race and archetype, you can really have a ridiculous variety of character combinations.

I also think feat points help it give the players a great deal of narrative control that is common in more rules light games.

Possibly the biggest draw for me is the fast combat. It's not just one thing, but a big part is that "hit points" don't inflate as you progress. You can get better armor and increase your stats to have more hit boxes, but it never gets to the point where you are just chewing through hundreds of hit points by trading blows back and forth. Street thugs with guns are always going to be dangerous. 

For Unleashed, I'm super excited to have access to Hordes races and careers. Like the first books, there are a few things I have to homebrew to fix, and that's a bit annoying, but it's not enough to make me not be excited about what's there (the biggest complaint I have is no rules for ranged based warlocks).  




 pain in the ass

Assembling is my least favorite part of the hobby. Painting, basing, and playing are all good, but I just dislike the assembly. 




 You'll need a drill of some kind (I use a dremel, but also [pin vices](https://www.wonderlandmodels.com/media/managed/large/ppv2237-d.jpg) work, and they are good for pinning). 

Neodymium 3 x 1.5mm magnets are what I use, and you can get them in ridiculous bulk on ebay for cheap (I got 200 for about $10 shipped). 

And then glue. Cyanoacrylate (super glue) works fine for me. 

Something you are going to want to be mindful of is poles. When you glue the magnet to one piece, make sure you know what side to glue to the other piece. A trick I use is to put the piece with the magnet already attached into a small thin plastic bag (usually the kind the parts of the mini came in). Drop the other magnet over the first one, and then stick the other piece with glue in the hole on top.

Good luck and have fun (though magnetizing is a p.i.t.a. to me).  




 Honestly, I've been trying to find that video for several days now, and I can't seem to find it. If I do I'll post a link here. 




 The thing is, it's easier to get good results with model paint than it is to get the same results with craft acrylics. I use both, but I doctor up my craft acrylics quite a bit (and they still aren't as nice as using my model paints), and the results come out pretty decent. 

The main difference between, say, vallejo and craft paint is that the pigment in the vallejo paints is ground down much finer than in the craft paint, and so is less likely to be clumpy or chalky and obscure detail. You also get better coverage easier with better paints (craft paints thinned down take many many coats to achieve the same vibrant color as just a few coats of model paint).

All that said, if it's your first mini, you probably won't even notice. Your first couple models will be kinda bad, but you will probably learn quick enough that you could not waste too much model paint. 

Another note, craft paint is totally fine for things like terrain projects, so if you are going to be doing that anyway, might as well start with craft paint on minis, and then just use it for terrain after you upgrade to model paints.

*edit: There was a video I saw before that showed the same color, in both craft acrylic and model paint, side by side on a flat surface, and the difference is incredible. On a figure, the difference is less obvious (still obvious, but less so). 




 You could go the wargame route and use a measuring tape. 




 There is Gumshoe. I can't think of many others though, at least not that are specifically designed for that. Definitely not many though. 




 Ha ha, awesome. Fanatic Pastafarians. 




 I've never played Hackmaster before, but now I want to. 

I understand people that want to play something specific, but I don't think I've ever had as much fun as I have when I've randomly generated my character. 

I would probably add rolling randomly for race and class too, leaving gender the only choosable option. 




 [Welcome to Fun Town.](http://www.reapermini.com/FigureFinder) 




 Correct. You can run games using nothing more than the Unleashed book.  




 Well, it's a stand-alone expansion to the Iron Kingdoms roleplaying game (the first book is now commonly reffered to as IK: Full Metal Fantasy to distinguish the two). 

There is a subredit devoted to it: /r/ikrpg

On the official site, [all the books available for it](http://privateerpress.com/iron-kingdoms/core-products), [free downloadable resources](http://privateerpress.com/iron-kingdoms/downloads), and [official forums](http://privateerpressforums.com/forumdisplay.php?43-Iron-Kingdoms-Roleplaying-Game).

[Here's](http://ikrpg.info/) another useful site.

[Pretty good excel character generator here](https://miniarmyhugetimesink.wordpress.com/2012/10/12/skis-ikrpg-character-generator-pretty-much-does-the-heavy-lifting-for-you-check-it-out/), though I doubt it's updated for Unleashed yet.

Let me know if you are looking for anything else.

**edit:** [Here](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/146332/Iron-Kingdoms-Unleashed-An-Introduction-to-Savagery) is a free starter adventure for IK:Unleashed. 

A bit more general stuff: Iron Kingdoms is a steampunk fantasy setting that started as an adventure/setting for 3rd edition D D, then it became a wargame (Warmachine/Hordes), and then it became it's own rpg. 

Unleashed focuses on the "wild" parts of the world, with druids, trolls, gatorman, etc. Iron Kindoms: Unleashed is to Hordes as Iron Kingdoms: Full Metal Fantasy is to Warmachine. 

It's a pretty rules heavy game, but of the rules heavy games out there, it has some of the fastest combats. This is mostly because combat is very deadly, and rarely lasts more than a few rounds. Character creation is also pretty quick, and uses a two-class (called "careers") system that gives a lot of flexibility to players. It does not focus on making "balanced" characters in the way of making them all equally useful at everything. Instead, the only form of balance between careers is that they all get to have something cool.  




 Uh, what kind of information are you looking for? 




 Well, it's better than hiding the railroading under the guise of an encounter that has only one possible outcome. At least my suggestion lets you get back to actually playing the game again rather quickly.
 




 Just say it happens. No need to come up with mechanics for it. If you put it in an "encounter" they will think they have a chance of stopping it. 




 Honestly, it doesn't matter what you pick because in order for it to work, you'll have to "cut scene" it to make it happen the way you planned. There's no point in saying "You have to do this.", just say it happens and move on. Otherwise someone will say they do something else, and then you'll have to tell them no, and you'll just be wasting everyone's time. 




 One thing, you've already written the ending. Most players are going to go against your ending, and if they can't, they'll be pretty disappointed. I wouldn't do it unless you know your players don't mind railroading, or you tell them upfront. 

You're not going to see a good solution because it's not really a good plan. Think about playing a video game. If you got to the end, and there was no real option except to die, wouldn't you be pissed? Plus, good luck getting all the players to do the same thing. Half might be willing to sacrifice themselves, but the rest probably won't. 

I'm not saying it's not possible for it to fun, I'm just saying you are already making it hard on yourself. 




 The Spellfire Wielder feat from Magic of Faerun (I think) might be close to what you are looking for.  




 Antimagic or *Antimagic*? 

I mean, someone who cancels out magic, or someone who kills magic users? 




 Buy it and scan it yourself. At the moment, that's the only legal option. 




 This looks exactly like the case that the old World of Warcraft TCG came in, probably cleaned out with a custom cover paper.

*edit: [Yup, totally is.](http://imgur.com/a/K9OdF) I happen to have one sitting next to me. 




 Blush sounds like a class in a pulp-noir game or something to me.  




 No, that is a dragon. 




 I don't know. I think it's doubly funny that you only called out 'eyeliner', and I can just imagine you thinking about the Blush and Concealer classes (actually super cool names for rogues though). 




 I'm terrible at picking factions, that's why I pick them all. The only factions I don't really care for are Retribution and Skorne, and it has nothing to do with how they play; it's purely on their aesthetics (anime and trunkless elephants aren't my thing). 

Trolls are great. If you are worried about it being too straightforward, try out Jarl Skuld for faster hit-and-run style, or Gunnbjorn for a shooty troll force. We can do beast heavy with Doomshaper or Calandra, and can do the stereotypical melee brick with just about anyone (but especially Grissel). Most of the factions have the same kind of flexibility, and just "flavor" it differently.

The thing that makes trolls trolls is that even when they are doing something else, they are tough. A good Gunnbjorn list is nearly as shooty as a typical Cygnar list, but they are going to be harder to take out since absolutely everyone has tough.  




 You keep saying "flexible/adaptable". The only factions in this game that don't really fit that bill are the minion factions and Cephalyx. 

You can run melee heavy Cygnar, jack heavy Khador, hit and run trolls; it's just not typical in the faction, and there are less warcasters designed to do it well. That doesn't mean there are none though.  




 [This one](http://www.reapermini.com/FigureFinder#detail/60147) seems like it might be a decent fit. 




 I think [Horrorclix](http://www.miniaturemarket.com/collectible-miniatures/horrorclix.html) might have what you are looking for. I bought a bunch of them before, and though you might want to re-base them, they are pretty decent minis. 




 Wrong sub, mate. 




 Give them out as party favors at birthday parties. 




 I'd help, but I don't know anything about Pathfinder. 

[This](http://paizo.com/products/btpy7z7f?Dungeon-Issue-99-with-Polyhedron-158) might be something to check out though. 




 I couldn't help but think of [my favorite TV show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcGSP4ucEc0). 
























 Why not just go one step further? Percentage systems, by your reasoning, are the absolute best. You literally just decide a percentage and *that's the percentage*. 

That "easy to figure out" thing you just explained is about 100 times more complicated than 2d6. I don't have to figure out percentages. With a smaller range (and thus, smaller, more meaningful bonuses), and most of the die rolls falling in the middle of the range, you can simply say "This is a hard door" and it's the same difficulty no matter what level the players are. And because of the distribution of die rolls being in the middle of the range, players can actually count on doing pretty well most of the time. 

The only d20 games that I enjoy playing (for the game itself, I can have fun with anything if I have the right people), is Cypher System and D D5e. 

Cypher System isn't even a real d20 (I run it all the time using d6s, and I barely have to change anything). It increases or decreases difficulty in increments of 3 (roughly 15% change in success), and it *still* feels way to swingy from that huge d20 die. The thing that really makes it excusable is that you can expend effort to lower the difficulty of a task, and you can burn points to reroll a bad roll, giving the player a bit of control over their fate.

D D5e does an okay job of getting rid of the problems of a d20 with Inspiration and Advantage/Disadvantage. Most of the time it's essentially a 2d20DL system, and has a much different distribution of results than say, 3.5/PF or 4e. Also, for anyone reading this, I highly recommend bumping the max number of Inspiration to 3. You can thank me later. 




 I think the Sith see that more as a guideline than an actual rule. Like pirates. 




 Except that then the dice don't matter. I like to have skill and luck matter.

Also, unless you point out a specific game system, this conversation is too general to really make any real sense. 




 Other people nailed it. I think someone who knows what they are doing is going to do what they do most of the time, and rarely have it be spectacularly bad or good. With a single die system, and especially a large die like a d20, whether you are good at something almost never comes up; it's mostly whether or not you were lucky.

Now, for some games I actually like the crazy swingy die of death (like in Paranoia), but for a serious long term campaign, 2d6 lets players feel like they are more in control of their own fate, but there is still some luck going on to spice things up. 




 We should make this a guessing game for mobile users. 




 2d6 dice system, two class system, tactical combat, flexible narrative control for players, ridiculous number of options for players to customize their characters, amazing setting, magic that doesn't trump martial characters even at high levels, genuinely non-vancian magic, exciting combats that don't take several hours, and that's enough for now [Iron Kingdoms](/spoiler)

Using descriptions of things as actual rules benefits and penalties [Fate](/spoiler)

An attempt at bounded accuracy [D D 5e](/spoiler)

A detailed system for generating star systems, and a system for players to develop their own faction to interact with other interstellar factions [Stars Without Number](/spoiler)

I unique dice system that generates narrative during combat with non-linear results [Star Wars: Edge of the Empire](/spoiler)

A simple core mechanic that allows the GM to create content on the fly with ease [Cypher System](/spoiler)

A GM-less universe-building system with the ability to cooperatively create a timeline of thousands of years [Microscope RPG](/spoiler) 




 Aside from the shoulder, you can also glue his wrist to his hip. You might even be able to bend it a bit so you can glue the edge of the sword to the base. If you are having problems with that arm, you might want to be careful with the other pieces too. That bird is awfully precarious on his arm.

If you absolutely don't want it coming loose, you'll need to pin it. 




 [It sounds amazing.](https://youtu.be/hEB5FlAI_2I)

edit: oh, sorry for the Disney Star Wars spoilers. 




 For running games for your friends that don't live nearby, it's great. I had been using a number of other options for virtual tabletops and kept bouncing around looking for one that was reliable. Once I found roll20 I haven't needed to look for another since. It had the most important things I was looking for: stability, and ease of use (for the players, at least). I had problems with so many other VTTs, and it got so bad I almost gave up entirely, but roll20 is just what I need. It also has a lot of really nice features, like character sheets and macros, that are a nice bonus. I have ran D D 4e/5e, Gamma World, Numenera, Fate, Rogue Trader, Iron Kingdoms, Stars Without Number, and numerous homebrew systems without any problems on there. Some worked a little better than others, but usually it just took a little more work for some of them to start running smooth.

Finding random internet people to play with is a different thing though. You may as well plan it as a one-shot, because you will probably lose about 60% of your group every month or so. It's just the nature of the thing. It's also very hard to get people you can really connect with. It's not bad to scratch an itch, but it's not the same as playing with a real group. I'm not saying it's not possible to make friends on the internet and have it turn into a real group, it just doesn't normally go that way. 




 I was like you.

I picked all of them. 




 I love doing this kind of thinking. It works so great to really give otherworldly beings a sense of the unknowable.

Examples:

All of a sudden, the alien "attacks" stop outside a certain area. It's possible to sneak into the area, but if the aliens catch you, it's a quick and brutal death, with your corpse discarded just outside the area. = We try to clear our house of ants, and if we see one, we squish it and throw it outside (or in the garbage).

You seem to make somewhat friendly contact with an alien. It doesn't seem to understand you, but follows you, watching you, and then for seemingly no reason, starts trying to kill you. = Kids watch ants, and kill them, basically at random. 

Aliens have been abducting people (with no real rhyme or reason as to who they take), doing strange tests, and keeping the bodies in a storage facility. Occasionally they will bring out one of the older abductees, do more tests, and put them back, but for the most part they just keep them in storage and observe them. = People having butterfly collections.

Settlers struggling to survive in an alien land find food left out for them from aliens that otherwise have avoided all contact. It turns out to be poisonous. At first it's unsure whether it was intentional or just a misunderstanding. That is, until death machines fly overhead spraying aerosolized toxins all over the settlement. = Leaving pest poison out, and when that doesn't work, spraying for them. 




 Not to "out" them (NDA being a possible thing), but I happen to know that one of my local stores gets PP stuff exactly 60% of retail. 




 Whipblade covered your question pretty good, but I actually recommend getting the adventure kit box. You can look at the rules and adventure it comes with [here](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/146332/Iron-Kingdoms-Unleashed-An-Introduction-to-Savagery). That's all the written material from the box for free. I got the box anyway. The minis alone are worth the price for me, but the map tiles are really great too, and it gives you a mini rulebook to pass around during the game. 

Also, if you are talking about the [Undercity](http://privateerpress.com/iron-kingdoms/board-games/the-undercity) game coming out it August, it's not *directly* compatible. It's a board game, and while the rules look like they are very similar to the RPG, they are almost definitely not compatible. However, it's going to have *tons* of minis, and probably the same quality map tiles as the adventure kit. 

[Here](http://files.privateerpress.com/ironkingdoms/documents/adventures/IKRPG_Scenario_Fools_Rush_In.pdf)'s a link to the other IKRPG starter adventure. I recommend running one or both of them to see how you like it, and then going from there. 




 You're going into a pretty hazy area of definition that doesn't really work with the alignment system. In reality, my alignment is a many layered thing, that changes depending on the specific topic at hand. Evil isn't even something that can really be defined as an absolute all or nothing thing.

Essentially, I don't think anyone else is qualified to be in control. I put myself above absolutely everyone else because I don't trust anyone. If given the opportunity to seize power by force, I would take it. Would I use that power for good? Maybe, but all the good I would accomplish would come at a terrible cost, and I would almost certainly use it for some evil. 

The problem with this being neutral is what is left for evil? Only people who are maniacal psychotics qualify as evil? Aren't they probably just incapable of empathy? Doesn't that make them less instead of more culpable than someone who knows the pain they are causing and doing it anyway? I would think that that makes them no longer on a scale of human morality, that since they can't perceive good, they can't be judged by it. Like a rabid dog who kills a child. You have to stop it, even though it's not evil. Is killing a madman hurting him or helping him? Would locking him up be more or less torturous? Who decides if he deserves more or less torture?

I can call myself evil because I don't hold myself to such a high regard that I can believe I am without guilt, without sin, without a trail of darkness stemming from my actions, regardless of my intentions. I don't have enough information to judge others, I have only enough information to judge myself. If I come out at the end of this life as neutral, it is due to outside circumstances affording me that privilege, as I am willing to commit evil. 




 What do you think it needed for social interaction that it doesn't have? Is there a game that you can point to that you would say does it right? 




 I still don't understand when people say this. I have a couple problems with IKRPG, none of which are lack of non-combat options. What would you say it doesn't have rules for?  Also, what is an example of a game that has what you are looking for in terms of non-combat rules? 




 Since absolutely no one else is saying it, I'm going to point out the only time playing canon characters is fun: pre-mades. If it's a one-shot, I think it'd be perfectly fine to hand out sheets of the really cool guys that people would recognize. Anything else though, and no one is going to like it. 




 I also have a half-and-half Kromac. My Molik Karn and Corollary are the same way. I actually really like how it cuts the weight down. I haven't tried painting any of them yet, so I can't say for sure if I'll notice a difference, but I don't think there'll be any problems. 




 Genocide, slavery, and oppression aren't evil? Sweet. I'm going to call Hitler and Stalin and tell them they weren't that bad. 

Believing you are good while you do the same thing as someone who knows they are evil does not make you less evil. 




 Lawful Evil, and I'm the good guy.

The world needs someone to control it to keep it from tearing itself apart. To insure your future, some freedoms must be surrendered.  




 I'm a big Searforge fan, so #49 was awesome to me.  




 Microscope RPG 




 Here's what I do, for any kind of check: if they roleplay well, waive the roll. 

If someone gives an inspiring speech, I don't make them roll, it just works (because it was inspiring). 

If someone tackles a guy off a balcony to crash into another guy below, it just works (because it was awesome).

The dice should only really be brought in when you aren't sure what would be cooler, failure or success.  




 People don't suggest removing Strength to encourage roleplaying because you don't have random heavy objects laying about to physically get out of your seat and lift to see whether or not you succeed (at least I don't).

However, I have to agree that removing the stat is a bad idea. Not everyone is naturally charismatic, or intelligent, or wise, but that doesn't mean their character can't be. 

I **do** think rewarding people who bring those kinds of special skills to the table is a good idea, though. I usually waive the roll if they roleplay well, and that's for any of the attributes (even Strength).  




 I recommend using the [Iron Kingdoms RPG](http://files.privateerpress.com/ironkingdoms/documents/adventures/IKRPG_Scenario_Fools_Rush_In.pdf) rules to run Eberron. I've done it before, and it makes for a grittier, more "war-torn" feel.  




 Thanks.

That's life. I've had a lot of really great games end before their time, it's just how things go.

 




 They had to contend with other businesses doing shady things to put them out of business, deal with criminal elements trying to use their club as a place of "business", keep corrupt political officials off their back, handle shipping problems for their product, and then deal with trying to make customers happy (or keep them from wrecking the place); all while managing the money in order to make a profit. 

I think the key to keeping it entertaining was having very "colorful" enemies that the players couldn't really just kill off. I based their profits on how well the handled the little side quests. If it went well, profits went up, if it went okay, they stayed the same, and if it went bad, it caused a dip in their bottom line. I told them if their profit got low enough they would have to shut down, but it never came to that.

They were getting really big with clubs in four major cities, but we had 2 of the 4 people drop out of the game because of real life. I was working on converting the Stars Without Number faction mechanics to get them into an international "corporation" sort of game, but I didn't get to try it out.  




 I ran a game for a while where the players were nightclub owners. 

Other than that, I have to agree that PP has most of it covered. 




 I couldn't help but think of [this](https://youtu.be/a_NirAeZqig). 




 Damn, Doomy makes a great Gul'dan.


edit: makes me want to do a Gul'Doomy, with a Mulg Infernal.

edit2: I see you went for Pyre Troll Infernal, nice.

edit3: Well shit, I just noticed you're the Borderlands Warmachine guy. I love your stuff. 




 I was hoping someone mentioned IKRPG here. 

People have actually been doing this already with IKRPG (myself included): [link](http://privateerpressforums.com/showthread.php?122017-Warmachine-munda) [link](http://privateerpressforums.com/showthread.php?32410-Gangs-of-Five-Fingers)

Necromunda was basically this a long time ago, and it's ridiculously fun.  




 I've had too many problems with it starting arguments over what actually happens with real world physics. One guy will quote his high school physics teacher, another will cite an article he read, and another guy will bring up a Mythbusters episode, all with different beliefs as to what would happen. This is an even bigger problem when it comes to combat. I ran a game with a veteran and an MMA fighter, and they would interrupt the game to demonstrate how they were right on each other. It was still fun, but I don't think I could handle doing it again.

Since I am not a physicist (or any kind of real world warrior), and I don't routinely interact with action oriented physics, I stick to what I know: movie physics. Besides, explosive decompression is so much cooler than what really happens. 




 This could actually be really cool. I'm not going to put any time or effort into setting it up, but I'd definitely run a couple one-shots for it for the opportunity to play in a few.

I am worried that the online IKRPG community is pretty damn small, and it would probably end up being the same as if you had a sandbox West-Marches style game with maybe two GMs. 




 I'm interested. 




 I absolutely agree with you. 




 It all depends on the kind of game you are going for. If you are going for hyper-realistic hard scifi, then that sort of thing is fine. 

However, when I run scifi games, I make sure to tell people I'm using movie physics, not real-world physics, and what works is based more on whether or not it sounds cool and makes the game interesting. 




 I did. I've been hooked ever since. 




 Aside from the problem everyone else has pointed out (the fact that you are basically reinventing the wheel), I'm going to address the actual issue you talked about. 

Having a rules system without a setting means that it's not going to work for any setting without adjustments. Unless you are planning on including guides for all of that too, it's probably best to pick a setting that it works best for and go with that. People can always ignore the setting and use the system if they want to use it for another setting.

Odds are, if the rules you have are any good, they are probably best for a fairly specific setting. If you have that setting in mind, presenting your rules as part of it also shows them in the best possible light to your target audience. If you say your rules are good for any setting, and I try to use them for one you didn't have in mind, I'm probably going to be disappointed with my experience. 




 Minitaur Bardbarian. People will just think you have a speech impediment.  




 What /r/Russano_Greenstripe said. 

[This](http://ikrpg.info/Index/) is a pretty good resource for seeing what is in each issue. Generally, there is about 2 to 3 articles for IKRPG in it. The price is a bit high if you are only in it for the IKRPG articles, but not too bad if you cherry pick the ones you really want (I absolutely love the one about Rhulic warcasters and jacks, and can't live without it, and there is a similar one for Cyriss options).  




 The adventure "Dirty Deeds" from No Quarter #52 is all about mercenaries and charters. It's probably the best "official" source of inspiration. 

Other than that it's just about doing trial and error. Pick something that sounds right, and adjust based on how you feel it's doing.
