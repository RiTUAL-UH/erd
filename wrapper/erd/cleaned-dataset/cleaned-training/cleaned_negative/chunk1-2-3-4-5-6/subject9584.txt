 Yes. Especially in a free state like the US, and much of the world, where military service is volunteer based. Perhaps you disagree with the government's use of military force, but you can still support and wish the best for those that volunteered to put their life on the line. 




 1900's like entire century or 1900's like 1900-1909? 




 I absolutely love the show. The writing   acting is fantastic. Each episode keeps you on the edge of your seat and the plot moves along too, it doesn't get stagnant. But I talk to friends and most haven't even heard of it and those that have, haven't seen it or know much about it. And I didn't hear much of anything regarding it leading up the Emmy's. What gives? 














 I want to make a simple bar graph using data across several 8 different sheets. All it is a numerical value in cell H2 of each page. I just want each of the 8 values to be a column in the graph. How do I do this?

 I just got Amazon Prime so now I have access to all the past HBO shows. I haven't seen any HBO besides GoT, so I was wondering what I should start watching first. 







































 If you ship commodity cards, are they then also able to be used in the end game scoring of the bonus tiles that give you 3 points per shown commodity? Or can you only score those if you take the seaport action to lay those in your player area? 














 "I want to make a gif of that Charlie Murphy skit with Rick James when he's stomping on the couch saying "F YO COUCH" but replace the couch with waffles and update the text accordingly. However I don't have the technology available on my phone." This is a request from my dear friend and I want to make this for him. It's the US game today and his birthday. Is this possible?! 














 My goal is to highlight the whole row based off Column B being greater/lesser than Column C, but excel always interpets Column A (which is words) as greater than the any numerical value. So it'll will never highlight Column A when B is less than C. 

[Here is my example](http://i.imgur.com/kOgkm76.jpg). I'd like each row to be uniform.  




 Hey, I'll be in Dublin this Friday - Sunday and was wondering if there's any pick up ultimate around the city?  














 I'll be backpacking Ireland for 12 days this summer and I was wondering what the best options would be. I'd like to buy a package ticket if possible. It seems Bus eireann and Irish Rail are the two main systems. Are there tickets that includes a pass for both? 

I'll be going from Dublin to, Wicklow, Kilkenny, Waterford, Cork, Kinsale, Killarney, Kerry, Galway, back to Dublin.  









 I don't want to spend a ton of money. It'll be my first bike, but I want something more than a rusty bucket off CL. When I'm looking used, what brands should I keep an eye out that offer a reliable "starter" bike? Can I get anything decent for $200-$300?  



















 I'm just looking for a place to crash in Dublin for a night or 2 while I start my backpacking through Ireland! I'm real easy going, looking to meet some awesome people and experience the Irish culture! I can cook too! 



















 I'll be going off to Ireland for 12 days in a month. Basically making my way from Dublin, around the southern coast, up to Galway. I've heard the public transpo is pretty good in Ireland. What's the most bang for my buck and best routes to take along the way? Thanks! 



















 When you add a new family member, will they only need 1 food for the next harvest, or will they only need 1 food if they were 'born' in a harvest round? Say, I added a family member in round 12, at the round 13 harvest would they cost 2 or 1 food?

 I'm running into problems with Atlanta, specifically the Connect All Tiles bonus. I'm reaching one gray to another and various points along the outside. Every tile is connected through the tiles somehow. I don't get why it keeps failing 




 I've never backed anything on Kickstarter. Prices can be so much higher than what a typical game costs, I have trouble justifying the investment on something I've never seen. So I was wondering how other gamers look at Kickstarter. Have you backed games on Kickstarter? Have you regretted any? Great experiences, bad experiences? What's the general flow like when you back something? 




 I typically like medium to heavy strategy games with minimized luck (terra mystica, eclipse, castles of burgundy, suburbia etc). If the game has a stronger thematic play to it, then all the better, but not crucial.  












































 I definitely don't need something huge. I'll be staying in hostels/hotels every night, so no camping eqpt needed. I was looking at the Osprey Stratos 36. Seems light, accessible and organized. Any others I should check out? My main wants are light, organized storage areas and 35-40L. 




 We have a group that regularly gets together for board game nights and we were more than happy to help out and teach them (anywhere from high school to college) games! It was a lot of fun. [**Here's what we were able to muster up**](http://i.imgur.com/vfEVqzK.jpg) 

Favorites of the night were King of Tokyo, Pandemic, Dominion and Burgundy. Pretty much all of the people were new to games, so they didn't get into the heavier stuff. We're going to try to do this every 1 or 2 months, so we hope it continues! 









 Any recommendations on hostels in Dublin, Galway and if there's any around cork, killarney, limerick or brunner would be much appreciated. I always just like to look at forums and not just review sites, since there's so many paid reviews nowadays. Thanks! 




 I'm planning a trip to Ireland and trying to decide whether to use a tour (likely Go Ahead Tours) or just backpack it. People that have done tours of Ireland, is it worth it? Would I be better off planning it myself? 









 My pipes froze 3 weeks ago during the blizzard. The cold water pipe has not worked since and yesterday the hot water froze too, nothing comes out. They have still not come to fix anything. Came home from worl today to find ice formed in a bowl and all along the hose attachment. They refuse to fix anything, saying the city isn't giving enough pressure (no neighbor is reporting this, we checked) and won't raise the heat. Several of the apartments have dogs. They are threatening to file litigation against anyone who doesn't pay rent or tries to break lease and move out. I'm still holding on to my rent money. 


tl;dr - do NOT move into one of their buildings.

 So basically, I'd like to conditionally format cells in a chart based on their adjacent cell. Some if it is simple: For instance if the cell in Column C says "Total" I'd like the text in the same row in Column D to be bold with a green fill. Is this possible? What formula would I use? 




 I should clarify...actual specific classes within sites live Kahn Academy or edX 









 I'll be staying on Yonge st for the weekend and was hoping to catch the NFL playoff games on Saturday. Any good places within walking or quick cab ride distance? I heard Sports Centre cafe is decent? 




 So I haven't gotten Fifa since 11, well before this new manual tackling was implemented. I overpursue every player with the ball, constantly whiff with the tackle button. And holding contain just keeps him a few yards off and generally lets the guy go right by him if he makes a sprint. I'd love some tips, cuz I am just not used to this and it is frustrating as hell.  









 Simply put, I thought every character in the book was profoundly unlikeable, and while I generally enjoy Kundera's prose, I felt this book overly disjointed. I'd love to hear other peoples' thoughts on Tomas, Tereza, Sabina, Franz, the ending, the philosophy of the book, dreams or anything else.  





























 I'd prefer to keep it under the $20, or at least real close. I have lots of medium to heavy strategy games, so I'd like something lighter anywhere from 2-6 players.

 I don't have a fortune to drop $300, $400 or more on a Dyson animal vacuum, so what would people recommend for the best bang for the buck on a good vacuum for pet hair (I have an Aussie) in maybe a $100-$150 range? 









 My friends and I played our first 3 player game last night and I have some questions with problems we ran into. I started on the West Coast in Vegas and quickly fell behind as it was very expensive to span out, and my buddy found cheap expansion in the midwest and I could never really catch back up, because later I was completely blocked from expanding East as all the cities had 2 houses on them. This leads to my other question...the Step 3 card is at the bottom, and we had 2 houses on every single city in our 3 areas (the other 2 people had built 16 each), but we still had lots of power plant cards to go. So we spent several rounds simply holding auctions/passing on auctions, collecting resources   money. Until we got to the Step 3 card, built a bunch of houses and the game was over. Is this normal?
 




 Does anyone know where I can find this? Or even better, does anyone have a copy they want to sell?? 




 Hey, I have a 4 year old dog that doesn't do great with other dogs. Do people have recommendations for a training school or an individual dog behavioral therapist?  




 I have a 4 year old mini australian shepherd. He's fantastic with people. Loves em all. However, he doesn't do well with dogs. He gets uber-excited when he sees them and immediately tries to sprint right at em and jump on em (I'm 99.9% sure it's playing). This freaks other dogs out and they growl/bark/snap at him, which then scares him and makes him defensive. I know he needs to be socialized more, but I can't because of this and friends with dogs won't bring their dogs over or really want him at their house. 

I was thinking about bringing him to a doggy day care for some immersion therapy but I don't want him to end up being crated the entire time because he can't get along with any dog. What kind of tricks or training things can I do?

TL;DR my dog sucks with other dogs, need training advice

Tip of the cap to Z-Man games. This game is beautiful. The colors are vibrant, the board is thick (even the back of the gameboard has great artwork!) and everything feels of top notch quality. Any helpful tips so I can reign supreme in my group?? 














 Edit: for some questions: I'm not looking to sell em. I'm moving, they're broke, if some of my buffalo friends want me for parts or paper weights, just come pick em up! For what's wrong with them: Xbox boots up immediately to red light (also the pop-in hard drive from the side/top is gone).

 So I just got Twilight Struggle and have unbowed and am looking through the rules, and I just want to clarify something on placing influence tiles in a region. 

So if the enemy has influence or control in a country, can I gain control simply by placing more influence tiles? Lets say my enemy has control of Cuba (3) and I over a course of some turns place 6 influence, do I gain control? Can it be better to do that, if possible, over rolling for realignment or coups?  














 My friends and I are setting up our first game of Agricola and playing the family variant. Is it possible to bake bread in this or can you only do that through the improvement cards?

 So my friends and I have no played Eclipse twice and loved it. However, it seems to me both games progressed very peacefully then the end of the final round and it blew up into a massive onslaught on each other for  a few high valued hexes. It made the game seem very "last round dominant" if that's a thing. Has anyone felt the same while playing the game or are we just bad it? Is there a way to get to the game to progress so the first 8 rounds don't just feel like a set up for the final 9th round where everything was decided? 




 My friends and I love the German style strategy games and have played a ton of settlers, Puerto Rico, Dominion, 7 Wonders and eclipse (played for the first time a few days ago and loved it). Now it's pretty much my overdue turn to contribute a game and by and large everything I've read for these three games are all positive reviews. I'd like to find a balance of complex, randomness to encourage replayability, and something that doesn't take crazy long like an Eclipse or Through The Ages. Just looking for basic pros and cons, personal experiences with the games, and what not. Thanks! 
























 I was at Z-Man VIP Table Top Day. I have two extremes of feedback. 


First, I absolutely loved Pandemic: The Cure. It was fun, quick and super engaging. All around great time. Will be an insta-buy in the coming weeks of availability.


Secondly, Contagion was possibly the worst game I've ever played. It's not Pandemic. They branded it as such for marketing. It was dull, repetitive, slow and I couldn't wait to be done playing it. 




 Did Rampage get pulled back or have to be re-branded due to copyright? I thought I had heard something about that 




 My collection is chalk full of pretty heavy euros. I'd like to start adding some more 'fun' games into the collection, along the lines of King of Tokyo or 1st   Goal etc. I'd like an emphasis on more luck based, silly games just to get some laughs going. And I'm not looking for party games like Wits   Wagers or Cards against humanity 




 I think it's a must own for that very reason. It's not a must own because it's the best game ever. It's a must own because it's an easy game to teach people, get non-gamers in the door and experience the hobby a little.  




 I have 5 different Dominions and Trains. If you don't have Dominion in your collection, it needs to be. It's an essential game for board gamers. If it's definitely one or the other at this moment, go with Trains. There's more player interaction and some additional depth/more paths to victory due to the board. 


Rising Sun is an expandalone. Similar to Dominion: Intrigue, it fits in with the base game as an expansion, or can be played as it's own as it comes with all the components.


tl;dr You can and should have both. If you can't, I'd say Trains. 




 I thought the same thing exact thing. Either he copied that idea or this is some kind of repost 









 Can't believe I didn't think to check to see if that exists. Wow. Everything is on reddit! 




 oops, autocorrect I didn't notice. should be 'from a macbook purchase' 




 Sorry? 




 You bought all that in 4 months?? Holy crap dude. Were you playing Monopoly with real money on those boards? 




  American is don't care about brown squirrels 




 That would also be an accurate assessment of my statement haha 




 I'm not a huge fan of co-op games, but this is really fun. I had the opportunity to go to Z-Man's VIP Event for Table Top day earlier this year and got to demo this. Definitely recommend it, especially if you like co-op games at all. Lots of fun! 




 I played Contagion at Z-Man's VIP TableTop event. It was probably the worst thing I've ever played.

 I didn't draw any generalization from my comments. I just said that in this book, the characters were so horrible, they made the book cringe-worthy for me.

 I was on a huge kick, running through 20th century literature earlier this year and was loving reading and re-reading some classics. Then I got into **The Unbearable Lightness of Being by Milan Kundera.** Ugh. I couldn't stand anyone in the book. They all seemed some shamefully dramatic, trivial and annoying. I couldn't get with it. Cringed until the end.

 We had a safety in our game (yardage took offense into their own endzone) but they also rolled for a turnover. How do we score that? Is it actually a touchdown for the defense, or just a safety and offense punts?  




 No idea. I'm sure there's some reason. At some point I'm sure it came down to 'can we make more money by re-broadcasting this British show or re-creating it ourselves' 




 This will probably get buried, but can everyone stop getting butthurt about Americans remaking Utopia?? The issue is not if the original is good enough as is, the issue is ACCESS. The vast vast vast majority of Americans do not have access or aren't technologically savvy enough to find access to Utopia. My parents sure as shit aren't going to find torrents to download, but they'll watch the show when it's broadcast on HBO.  




 well it seems like the biggest difference is the extra shield people get at lvl 20. and the skip boost thing allows them to disappear/appear rapidly. And they have better guns.  




 I'm at level 15 right now, and the Crucible was fairly frustrating as I would get rocked by lvl 20-25+ players with more abilities than I have. So I was excited when I logged in today and saw the 'CLASH' sector that says 'Level Advantages Disabled.' I entered a match, and it was the same exact thing. People were level 25-28, had over-armor and boost abilities that I didn't and I got rocked again. What's the deal with CLASH? The level difference is really really annoying, makes me not want to get into the game at all

 Yea, unfortunately I started awhile ago on my iPad, and installed the game on my android phone last week in hopes to play there. Guess it's not to be.  




 Im sorry, but I dont want to be an emperor. Thats not my business. I dont want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone - if possible - Jew, Gentile - black man - white. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each others happiness - not by each others misery. We dont want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone. And the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way.


Greed has poisoned mens souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity. More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost....


 The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men - cries out for universal brotherhood - for the unity of us all. Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world - millions of despairing men, women, and little children - victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people.


To those who can hear me, I say - do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed - the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish. 


Soldiers! dont give yourselves to brutes - men who despise you - enslave you - who regiment your lives - tell you what to do - what to think and what to feel! Who drill you - diet you - treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder. Dont give yourselves to these unnatural men - machine men with machine minds and machine hearts! You are not machines! You are not cattle! You are men! You have the love of humanity in your hearts! You dont hate! Only the unloved hate - the unloved and the unnatural! Soldiers! Dont fight for slavery! Fight for liberty!


In the 17th Chapter of St Luke it is written: the Kingdom of God is within man - not one man nor a group of men, but in all men! In you! You, the people have the power - the power to create machines. The power to create happiness! You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure.


Then - in the name of democracy - let us use that power - let us all unite. Let us fight for a new world - a decent world that will give men a chance to work - that will give youth a future and old age a security. By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power. But they lie! They do not fulfil that promise. They never will!


Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people! Now let us fight to fulfil that promise! Let us fight to free the world - to do away with national barriers - to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance. Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all mens happiness. Soldiers! in the name of democracy, let us all unite!

 Do bases prevent your opponent from combatting your authority or do only outposts do that? The rules say "you may use combat to attack your opponent or their bases." does this mean you always have the choice of which to attack or just that combat is used against those two things when needed during the game?  




 Well, first of all, they were tied for 3rd best record. And I would argue they won 96 games in spite of Fredi. He constantly mismanages the bullpen, puts out bizarre lineups, bats Ryan Doumit a thousand times, and overall makes poor decisions on a daily basis.

 Our group has a rule of no new games for anyone after 10pm. We've found that if we teach a new game late, there's a good chance whoever is learning the game isn't alert enough to fully pay attention, they get grumpy, disinterested and end up disliking the game. So no new games on late nights! 









 Yea, I think the ally powers work sooo much better in Star Realms. I just feel like in Ascension, I'm buying cards at random every time. Just grabbing whatever I can afford to buy/combat every turn. But Star Realms really escalates with the ally powers and it's much more advantageous to do your best to stack up a color. And the bases are much more influential than a mechana construct or others in Ascension 




 This game is great. It gets compared to Ascension a lot, but I enjoy it far more. The 'factions' chain together much much better in Star Realms and there's far more interaction due to combatting each other (and not just the attacking the cards in Ascension).

 For anyone that is STILL on the fence about Trains, /u/toddbarker and /u/Sven_Burger are absolutely spot on. Trains is super fun, can have a bunch of different ways to victory which is neat for a deck builder, and comes with a lot of cards in the base so it's always a unique experience. Get it!

 I am with merqueen. When it comes down to it, yea Harry is the savior of the wizarding world (but not by any skill, genius or merit), he's just a kid. He's a teenager going through teenager shit. He's not the smartest, or the strongest or the fastest or cleverest. He's awkward, self-conscious, extraordinarily self aware and he's got a world of shit to deal with. Everything from trying to ask a girl to a dance from seeing friends murdered in front of him. But at the core he goes through things that teenagers go through, and through those tribulations he emerges [usually] victorious through his personal bravery, friends or simple dumb luck. If you're of a similar age, going through similar circumstances of self-doubt, awkwardness, often singled out and picked on, you look at Harry and think, "damn, I can do this too."

 http://i.imgur.com/meAyRDZ.gif 




 When I was a counselor, I woke up in the middle of the night to take a leak. As I walked from the front to the back of the cabin, I noticed one of the top bunks where a camper (let's call him Timmy) should have been. Neither Timmy or his sleeping bag were on the bed. I peek out back, thinking maybe he went to take a pee and didn't tell me. Nope. Timmy's not out back. Maybe he went across the field to the bathrooms to take a dump? Go look out front. Peer across, no light on in bathroom building. But now I see a shadowy, hunched figure in the middle of the field. I approach, mag-lite, in hand. As I approach, the smell worsens and the faint sound of tears begins to become audible. I find little Timmy, alone in the athletic field, crouched in his sleeping bag full of shit. 

He had awoke that night and was too much of a pussy to walk to the bathroom in the cold, so he tried to hop in his warm sleeping bag. He couldn't make it fast enough and his body's need to shit soon overcame his weak mind. He stopped, dropped his pants (inside the sleeping bag) and shit inside his place of sleep. Once the relief of his massive shit passed, he realized what he had done, froze, and remained there in his humiliated tears for over an hour. He also peed. 

edit: gold cuz my camper shit himself in a sleeping bag?! thank you! 




 whoa whoa whoa that's not really a fair assessment. I think Markakis caught a ball last year.  




 ITT: People saying he could have spent more. Come on. How many stories of domestic abuse, drugs, DUI's, deadbeat dads etc among athletes come up?? And one stand up guy does something and you complain about the ratio of donation to salary?? $16,266 worth of toys puts a smile on a hell of a lot kids' faces.  




 You connect to people who have jobs so later when they want a new job they can ask you for an in at your job.  




 Markakis isn't getting close to $15mill a year so he wouldn't be a Lowe/BJ/Uggla situation. I'd guess he'd be looking at $8-10 mill? I wouldn't mind Aoki for the right price though. His LD% increased, and some peripherals like HR/FB and infield hit rate were actually lower than his first couple years. He doesn't strike out much either which is nice.  




 I tried to can into space once. It did not go well.  




 [How were the facts on Fox News today???](http://captainawkwarddotcom.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/mad-men-gif-not-great-bob.gif) 




 So you'd rather stick a minor leaguer that's not ready? Magically create a young stud RF that can develop in RF and hit his prime in 2017? Just bench every good player on lose every game until 2017? Put Jose Constanza in RF? You need someone to play there. There's no reason not to get a serviceable, veteran guy who can help mentor young players and won't (or shouldn't) cost that much. Let's be clear here. The Braves aren't turning into the Astros and tanking. They still want to be good, they just know the priority is rebuilding the farm system. Signing Markakis has absolutely zero impact on that. None. It doesn't hurt the team in any way.  




 Ah. the guy that throws out arguments without evidence, like "nothing more than an average MLB starter" (despite a 2.5 war last year) is suddenly Bill James. Play a sport once in your life before you think leadership is useless. Especially with a young team.  




 Have you ever played sports?? Leadership and clubhouse unity is incredibly important in baseball. Have a team with a bunch of kids that have gobs of money for the first time ever, are used to being the best and are now at the top of the baseball world and likely mightily struggling. The 'they're freaking adult baseball players, who cares about leadership' is the dumbest, most obtuse argument out there.  




 Fun until everyone starts rubbing their fingers along the rim of your glass. 




 He's a solid veteran leader to have around young guys and in the clubhouse. He improves the team's disastrous strikeout rate by giving a solid contact guy. Basically, see everything that /u/PM-ME-UR-PROBLEMS- said above.


And for your argument...show me where he's trending downward? You provide zero evidence. One could argue he's due for another increase in numbers. His BABIP last 2 seasons are well below his career norms, his K% has decreased, his contact rate has gotten better. If anything, the peripherals suggest he could improve his numbers. His LD% dipped in 2014 and his IFFB% jumped. So you could say that was an anomaly and will trend back to their respective means as well.  




 Player A: not on this team anymore so it doesn't even matter.
Player B: No one is pretending is a long term solution. And his numbers increased in 2014 from a poor 2013.  




 2014 Player Comparison

Player A: 573 AB / .271 AVG / .351 OBP / 735 OPS / 74 R / 155 H / 26 2B / 11 HR / 58 RBI / 67 BB / 98 SO

Player B: 642 AB / .276 AVG / .342 OBP /729 OPS / 81 R / 177 H / 27 2B / 14 HR / 50 RBI / 62 BB / 84 SO



Player A is Heyward, Player B is Markakis. Markakis makes better contact, strikes out less, and has just about the same line drive and HR rate. Markakis has slightly better numbers in O-Swing% and Z-Swing% and much better contact rates at O   Z-Contact% than Heyward. 

Yes, Heyward's defense more than makes up for any disparity at the plate (fangraps WAR for Heyward last year was 5.1 and Markakis was 2.5). But Markakis won't come with Heyward's price tag (after 2015) and gives us a higher contact bat in the lineup. Would I rather have Heyward? Yes, of course. But Markakis isn't bad.

 It wouldn't be the worst thing in the world if we traded him within the division. Generally when you make a trade within the division the price goes up. Could get an even better return on him. And then just throw him high fastballs 16 games a season.  




 I went to college with a girl who prided herself on being able to predict what type of food a guy had eaten the day before based on how their jizz tasted. She called it her "party trick." She was popular at parties.

**edit:** I don't think she could actually taste anything. I think she just liked dicks in her mouth. 




 My fault, you are right. He was just an out machine 




 On paper. And we had the 2nd worst offense, only to Padres, in all of baseball. Simba, CJ and BJ were strikeout machines. All of the infield, except Freddie, were black holes at the plate. Freddie slumped, didn't hit for power. Heyward got on base at a good clip, but didn't hit all that well. JUpton's numbers were buoyed by a few great streaks. One of which came in that big losing streak so it was wasted, not that that was any fault of his.

Why are people saying Chris Johnson was good at the plate this year???? Did you people watch games???

 People need to stop looking at it like 'holy shit we traded heyward for shelby miller wtf.' 


Heyward has 1 year left on his deal, and by all accounts the Braves weren't going to be able to match what he may get on the market. Shelby Miller is young and, more importantly, has **4 years of control.** For GM's in baseball, money and contract control is HUGE. There's no way this trade would be done if each player had the same remaining contract length 




 Let go of the hate, man. Haters gonna hate hate hate hate hate. Shake it off.  




 This is the only comment that needs to be posted.

 Here's the article for those without insider:


Monday's trade between the St. Louis Cardinals and Atlanta Braves indicates the Cardinals are going all-in for 2015. 

Jason Heyward is just a year from free agency, but that one year will be a very valuable one, even if he just maintains the status quo. Getting away from the parade of dubious hitting coaches he worked with in Atlanta may help him unlock the still-untapped reserve of superstar potential in his bat. 

Heyward consistently rates among the majors' best defensive outfielders in terms of both advanced defensive metrics and traditional evaluations. A decent center fielder in high school, he outgrew the position but maintains the athleticism and strong reads that allowed him to play there as an amateur. He's a smart, disciplined hitter who gets on base at a good clip and doesn't strike out excessively, though he has had a lot of trouble maintaining a consistent swing around some shoulder issues; he often cuts off his load, producing too many ground balls with a shorter swing path. 

Oscar Taveras' death left the Cardinals without a clear right fielder for 2015, and this move locks down the position for just $7.8 million, making the team 4-5 wins better right away. It also gives the team the chance to work with Heyward and see if they can make him the MVP candidate most folks (myself included) expected him to become. 

The Cardinals also get two years' worth of right-handed reliever Jordan Walden, who throws a heavy mid-90s fastball and has developed a plus slider. According to pitch f/x data from baseballsavant.com, hitters swung and missed at one of every five sliders Walden threw in 2014, and put just 1.4 percent of them in play for hits. It's an ugly delivery, and he always has had command issues, but I believe the Cardinals have some kind of special fairy dust they sprinkle on relievers to get a little extra something out of them. And even if I just made that up, he'll give them 50-60 above-average innings of late-game relief work. 

[+] EnlargeShelby Miller
Jamie Squire/Getty Images
Atlanta-bound Shelby Miller posted a 2.92 ERA after the All-Star break in 2014.
For their trouble, the Braves get two premium young arms, one ready to step right into their rotation and one who immediately becomes the best pitching prospect in their farm system. Shelby Miller now has two solid, healthy seasons as a major league starter and won't be eligible for arbitration until after 2015. He seemed to find the perfect formula for his pitch mix in the second half of last season, working in his curveball more and using the four-seamer less; in turn he missed more bats, got more called strikes and cut his walk rate substantially. He's a mid-rotation starter at worst, as long as he stays healthy, and given his delivery and the evolution of his approach, I believe he can end up as a solid No. 2 starter. 

Tyrell Jenkins was the No. 74 prospect for me going into the 2012 season, then shoulder injuries robbed him of much of that season and 2013. But he came back healthy this year and was one of the best prospects in the Arizona Fall League. When I saw him there in October, he was 93-96 with good downhill plane, turning the pitch over quite well even at 95 mph, generating lots of ground balls. His slider was plus at 83-87, with curveball depth, and actually got sharper into his second and third innings. His changeup was fringy, straight at 86-88, effective because his delivery of the pitch is close to his fastball delivery, but lacking any life or action. He's as strong as ever, and his shoulder is the healthiest it has been in more than two years. A former three-sport star who had a football scholarship to Baylor, he repeats his delivery very well and has the aggressiveness you'd expect (and want) to see from a former quarterback. He immediately becomes the team's top pitching prospect and should be ready to begin 2015 in Double-A. 

The trade makes a ton of sense for both teams, although it's an acknowledgment on Atlanta's part of the weaknesses of the current roster and farm system and may not read very well to some of their fans. The Cardinals are -- and should be -- in win-now mode; they needed to upgrade their production on the corners and have some pitching depth to play with. As good a prospect as Jenkins is, he has thrown just 215 innings in the last three regular seasons combined and has never pitched a full, healthy season in pro ball. They can replace Miller in the rotation with one of Marco Gonzales or Carlos Martinez, assuming Michael Wacha returns healthy to be the fourth starter behind Wainwright, Lynn, and Lackey, and they have other young arms on the way. 

Atlanta was likely to lose Heyward after the season to free agency, and their farm system was left in terrible shape after former GM Frank Wren's tenure, so this deal helps restock their system with four more years of Miller and potentially six of Jenkins in exchange for one year of Heyward and two of Walden. Atlanta needed to make a trade like this to get younger and extract value from Heyward while they could. The Cardinals didn't have the same urgency, but they strengthened a weak spot on the roster and did so without significantly damaging their future.

 and possibly Austria after Holland. 




 Yes! I played it earlier this year at a demo day and it's a lot of fun. I'm not even a huge fan of Pandemic or co-op games in general. But this game moves quick, it's easy to pick up, there's a very good balance of luck and strategy. I'd definitely recommend it, even more so if you're a Pandemic fan.

 Scoring is not opaque at all in Terra Mystica. It's just done differently than some other games. Instead of a linear progression of building more valuable/higher scoring buildings, there are **scoring tiles** for each round that give bonuses for that round only. 

For example, Round 1 might give a bonus for every spade used. Round 2 may give a bonus for every trading house built. So it's very beneficial to time your buildings (if possible) to coincide with the round scoring bonus. That and other things like the cult track are linear progressions...the higher you go, the more you score. When you build a town, get a bonus tile with points. Pretty straightforward. 

Side note: Terra Mystica is my favorite game of all time. Freaking get it! 




 Why do you not like Fantasy Flight games?? 




 I'm as confused as you are. [This is the only sale I see](http://www.coolstuffinc.com/page/1175) 




 That doesn't really seem like a sale. Jaipur is normally $17-$19 on amazon. Love Letter is $7. Everything else is usually pretty close to those prices, it seems like everything is maybe $5 lower than usual?

 Can I list **Pillars of the Earth** 10 times? 




 **Twilight Struggle** we didn't score the scoring cards properly. We just took whoever "won" and what they got, and never scored the other person. So if someone had Domination, we never gave points to the other person for having Presence the first two games. No wonder the USSR blew out the USA early in both games, ha. Figured it out in game 3, and the game went muuuuch more balanced.  




 Great week of gaming!

Mid-Week I hung out with a friend and we played an intense game of **1st   Goal.** I turned the ball over 4 times, got 3 penalties, lost 2 onside kick attempts, and my buddy had no turnovers, no penalties and won an onside kick. I got stomped, but it was so much fun. The game is just fun. You can't take it seriously or else you'll get frustrated! Just a silly game, with some strategy/trying to know what your friend is going to play.

Sunday night we ended with a great game night after football. Game of **Small World**, which I'm not the biggest fan of, and ended up finishing 3rd. It's a good game, but I've just been more into heavier games lately and this just never clicked with me since I learned it a couple years ago. 

2nd up was a 4 player game of **Terra Mystica**. I got the Nomads and tried to expand as fast as possible early. I ended up being kinda mean, cutting off 2 people and won in the end by a good margin. I was lucky too, as the 1st round scoring tile was for dwellings, the 2nd for trading houses so I lined those up nicely. I absolutely love this game. It's my favorite of all time. Especially with 4-5 players so there's much more interaction and territorial conflict. Everything just fits together so so nicely. And it is gorgeous to look at.


We then moved on to a quick game of **Tichu**. Such a great 4 player/pairs of 2 game. Love the dynamic of the dragon/phoenix and scoring cards. 


A couple friends left so to the end the night, my friend and I busted out **The Duke** for my first time ever. WOW. This game is brilliant. I love it. So simple, lots of strategy, some luck/randomness in which tile you randomly draw. I wonder what would happen if you made a variant where you don't randomly select which tile to draw: just leave em all out on the side and you can pick which one you want every time. Thoughts on that? 




 Tichu is *fantastic!* My group just played a few games last night. The dynamic with the dragon and phoenix is very interesting. There's a lot going on here. It seems a simple trick taking game, but there's definitely depth, strategy and tons of replay-ability 




 It's awful. 




 Hit up Osteria last night. They had a real solid menu for restaurant week. Lots of options. 




 No worries! Also looks like there's a similar package available for the houses if you need as well, with listed weights and dimensions

 Haha, I think that would more be a job for the mods.  




 Thank you for posting this, I had forgotten it was starting yesterday!

No one tell my girlfriend... 




 Please, if you can, show me a screen cap of this. I'm a tech savvy person. I never saw anything resembling an option to use updated/custom rosters 









 Nope. I tried like 10 times. The option never comes up like it does in offline mode. The only option is whether I want to start season or start fantasy draft.  




 Yea, I'm still not sure about Bethancourt at the plate. He's still young so hopefully that contact rate can improve. And BJ certainly can't be worse...right?? And I wouldn't put CJ anywhere near exceptional on the defense meter. Fangraphs has him well into the negative in defensive rating every year of his MLB career 




 Same kind of thing as that...just keep plugging into different sources. Game of the Week on here, different podcasts like Secret Cabal or videos from the Dice Tower Network.

 What up real insanity wolf. Nice to see you again.  




 Yea. there's still not a ton of power down there. 




 Yea, Keith said he thinks Braves just turned a bottom-5 system into a top 10 system this offseason.  




 I don't think the FO wanted to run the risk of showing Gattis anymore, especially with no protection in the lineup. If he had a poor first half of the season...goodbye all value. I think it was the right move now. As Brad Pitt/Billy Beane said in Moneyball, "when you get the answer you're looking for, hang up." 




 Did everyone watch this team last year? Can we all remember for a second how putrid this offense was? With Gattis on it. 2nd fewest runs in baseball and roughly 87345763 strikeouts. Gattis' platoon splits are not good, his defense is terrible, and he was a great story that mashed home runs versus lefties with ease. It was magical 2 years ago when he hit all those game-tying and go ahead homers. Magical. But let's not kid ourselves. This isn't trading Gretzky in his prime. It's trading a home run specialist, whose main position is the same as your top prospect, in a time where you need to juice up the farm system. It's a win for the Braves.  




 9 fedoras. 




 There's a million threads on /r/boardgames about sleeves. Just run a search. Places like Michaels, JoAnne fabrics, Hobby Lobby etc all have card sleeves for dirt cheap. 




 Because if we stop debating them and allow their voices to go unopposed and uneducated, then they begin to win and continue to push a biased, uninformed and harmful agenda. So please, do not stop arguing with anti-vaxxers. 




 *Shitrish  




 From this write up, it would seem a great haul. I don't know much about any of these guys. To be fair, Law has never been a big Gattis fine, sighting his K rate, awful defense and platoon splits, so he'd probably see any decent return as a windfall for Braves

 [This is a list on BGG of games with solo variants](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/49479/soloplay-variants-posted-geek) 




 It's insider so I copied the text below. [Here's the link](http://insider.espn.go.com/blog/keith-law/post?id=3225 ex_cid=InsiderTwitter_Law_GattisTrade)

In dealing a trio of prospects for Evan Gattis, I really don't understand what the Astros are doing. The prospect depth they have in their system could allow them to acquire a player of a much higher caliber than Gattis, preferably a younger one as well, someone who's going to contribute to the next good Astros team in a few years. Atlanta, meanwhile, has gone from a bottom-five system in baseball to likely a top-10 system, overhauling their major-league roster while adding a broad mix of near- and long-term talent to their farm, in this case trading a player somewhere near the apex of his value for a very strong return. 

Gattis is already 28 years old, coming back to pro ball late after several years of off-field problems, and he brings four years of control. In two not-quite-full major-league seasons, he's shown big power, poor defense, horrible on-base skills, and huge platoon splits -- killing lefties but posting a .241/.297/.469 line against right-handers with enormous problems against right-handed breaking stuff. While Houston's a good ballpark for dead-pull right-handed power hitters, he's virtually positionless and doesn't address the Astros' major needs for hitters who get on base or at least make more contact. He's also disappeared in the second half in both of his years in the majors -- whether due to physical wear and tear or inability to make in-season adjustments -- and his body isn't durable. He's probably a bench guy, or a platoon player, but not a full-time solution at any position. The Astros also pick up James Hoyt, a hard-throwing (93-97 mph) right-hander that Atlanta signed from an independent league for $500 after the 2012 season, a good bet to provide some value in middle relief right away. 

In exchange for Gattis, Atlanta gets three prospects with question marks, but all of whom are legitimate major-league prospects with real asset value today. Mike Foltynewicz is the big get, and I would have traded Gattis for him alone. Folty is a high-beta prospect with the upside of a potential No. 1 starter if he can develop a more consistent arm slot and find an average third pitch to go along with an 80 fastball and 70 curveball. He drops down on the fastball at times and comes back up to get depth on the curveball, a trick that major-league hitters will exploit. His changeup will show plus, and ditching his slider (which he did early in 2014) may help him spend more time working on the change, but the change isn't good enough now to keep lefties from sitting on his four-seamer. Drafted in the first round in 2010, he's never seen the DL, and has the size and frame to be a durable 200-inning starter. His floor is a Nate Eovaldi type, and he'd be a wipeout reliever, but Atlanta has to develop him as a starter and hope the changeup comes along to the point where he can lead their rotation in 2017. 

Third baseman Rio Ruiz has developed nicely as a hitter, showing outstanding patience -- his walk rate put him among the top 10% of minor-league hitters this year, even though he was just 20 in a high-A league. Lancaster is a tremendous place to hit, however, and his power output was a little light given his home environment. He has good natural feel to hit and much of his contact is hard, but his load is getting too deep with his weight too much on his back side, interfering with his timing and reducing his ability to drive the ball out. At third base, he has the hands and arm, but he lacks rhythm in his feet and the ball tends to play him unless he's coming in on it; he has a chance to play at third, although it's at least 50/50 that he moves to first. Unlike a lot of young left-handed hitters, he has no real problem facing lefties. He projects as something similar to what Matt Carpenter has become for the Cardinals -- a high-OBP doubles hitter, a little less glove, a little more pop -- if he can stay at the hot corner. 

Andrew Thurman was a command right-hander when the Astros took him out of UC-Irvine in the second round in 2013, then started hitting 95-96 in spring training last year, only to head to the cold weather of the Midwest League and struggle with his control. He'll pitch with a 55 fastball and shows three potentially average or better secondary pitches, but nothing is plus and he has to throw strikes to succeed. I still like him as a potential fourth or fifth starter, but that assumes that he can harness his newfound velocity and stop walking guys. Of the three guys Atlanta got back in this trade, he has the lowest ceiling and the lowest probability, the latter due to his difficulty against low-A hitters last season. 

There's a good chance Atlanta walks out of this deal with an above-average starting pitcher and an everyday third baseman, which would be a heck of a return for a flawed player like Gattis. The Astros get four years of control of Gattis, and if they choose to use him behind the plate on occasion, the acquisition might free them up to trade one of their many catchers ... but is this the kind of player the Astros should be trying to acquire right now? They're not contenders this year, probably not in 2016, and by 2017 Gattis will be turning 31 and past peak, which we've probably already seen. I have no objection to the Astros trading from their passel of prospects to add real major-league talent, but they should be aiming higher than an OBP sinkhole who doesn't add value on defense. Foltynewicz is well-regarded throughout the industry, and I think he could have headlined a package for a much better player, now or during the 2014 season. 




 I did all that. It gives me that option for an offline franchise, but not an online franchise  









 Go to Roster, then slide over to "retire"  




 Well, I misread that title at first. Wondered what sub I was in for a second... 




 As long as it's the actual Carcassonne and not a small expansion, that's a tremendous deal! Get it!

 My first thought was like some sort of murphy bed cabinet hybrid. I couldn't really find an image to back it up though. Or maybe just something more straightforward like [this](http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/29035/file-27822948-jpg/images/beaded-shaker-side-tilt-opening-dsr.jpg?t=1420219707322)?


Good luck on your tiny home! I think that's awesome! And if you can't keep any games I'd be more than happy to take some off your hands :) Maybe even give ya some money for them if you really need! 




 [NOOOOO](http://www.baltimorenewsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Luke-Noooooo.jpg) 




 Can...can I get Five Tribes from you? 




 try meetup.com. I know my area has several groups coordinated through meetup that gather at various bars or cafes to play board games.  




 My only tip would be to all play as humans. Keeps everything even throughout the players and lets you get the understanding of the game. and ass /u/Show-Me-Your-Moves said, don't add house rules before you play the game. I've played lots of Eclipse and have never removed missiles and it's not a big deal. Sometimes someone gets missiles early, sometimes they come out real late. Sometimes someone gets a bunch of awesome discovery tiles and you don't. Things balance out during the game and each game unfolds differently.  




 I think the general sentiment isn't about having to go into a walmart, but supporting their business in general.  




 Well didn't you just buy it from them? 




 Boo walmart 




 Spector Ops looks preeetty sweet. Hearing good things on Spirits of The Rice Paddy as well. And I don't know if they'll allow it, but if you can snag a pre-order discount on the upcoming printing of Dead of Winter, do that too.  









 [**Acquire**](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/5/acquire) 




  Are the Egyptians and Japanese actually much harder than the others?


Only in a board game thread is that ok to ask.  




 **King of New York** is not a reprint. It's basically a sequel. Or a standalone expansion of King of Tokyo. And it's better than KoT. More strategy, more interaction, more decisions, more destruction, more fun.  




 The Secret Cabal podcast is my favorite. They release new episodes the 2nd Wednesday of every month, each episode is 2-3 hours so you get a lot of content. They do a great mix of talking about games they played that week, reviewing 1 game at length each episode, going over news and updates in the board game world, and if you're into RPG stuff, they talk about that too. They do contests occasionally too. It's good stuff 




 I think it's just as cool for people who don't know a lot about the Cold War, because the game organically teaches you so much about it. You're playing the game as you see history unfold.  




 The box art is pretty bland, but the board is gorgeous, and the cards are very nice as well. The game is just so incredibly balanced and the theme is absolute perfection. It very much is a 'struggle' as every decision you make has a big impact and many of those decisions you make may very well benefit your opponent. It's all about doing your best to minimize what you give your opponent and maximize what you do and score as best as possible. It is a masterpiece.  




 Ha, that's true. I guess I was just referring to the box size. 




 Yea, I feel you. What about taking a look at some scores from Cold War movies like Dr. Strangelove, Good Night   Good Luck, Tinker Taylor Soldier Spy, Hunt For Red October or the TV show The Americans.  




 I wondered to myself "I wonder what I'll find if I google 'cold war music." [This is what I found. Everything is on wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_songs_about_the_Cold_War). That should help for Twilight Struggle! 




 How about [**Jaipur**](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/54043/jaipur) or [**Hive Pocket**](http://www.amazon.com/Gen42-Games-5513668-Hive-Pocket/dp/B0079L0EKY/ref=sr_1_3?s=toys-and-games ie=UTF8 qid=1419971594 sr=1-3 keywords=hive)? [**Mr Jack Pocket**](http://www.amazon.com/Asmodee-700400ASM-Mr-Jack-Pocket/dp/B0040LJVNM/ref=sr_1_1?s=toys-and-games ie=UTF8 qid=1419971684 sr=1-1 keywords=mr+jack+pocket) is also wonderful. [**Star Realms**](http://www.amazon.com/White-Wizard-Games-Realms-Deckbuilding/dp/B00HRGMPIU/ref=sr_1_8?s=toys-and-games ie=UTF8 qid=1419971722 sr=1-8 keywords=eight+minute+empire) is the best micro game of the year IMHO, and scales past 2P with multiple decks. [**Coup**](http://www.amazon.com/Coup-Card-Game-Resistance-Universe/dp/B00GDI4HX4/ref=sr_1_6?s=toys-and-games ie=UTF8 qid=1419971722 sr=1-6 keywords=eight+minute+empire) is also a lot of fun and quick. I personally do not like **Cheaty Mages** at all.  




 Nice!  




 This thread will make me depressed to see how many bajillion more plays other people got than me this year :( 




 I enjoy the [Settlers of America](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/67239/settlers-america-trails-rails). Cities   Knights is probably the most popular expansion (i think?). 


Overall, in /r/boardgames, you're going to find a lot of Catan hate (and some love). It's such a popular game, a lot of people got their board game start playing it, and playing it to death, before moving on to games with much more strategy and depth. 


How old is your son? Ticket To Ride is a great intro game. Other games like Carcassonne or Dominion are easy enough to pick up, but off a ton of depth in strategy and replayability. Splendor is a new hotness that's simple, fun and strategic. Takenoko is a big hit with my gf who hates board games. It's a light, fun, beautiful game, and has a similar hexagonal tile element.  




 Filtering it [this way](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_pg_1?rh=n%3A165793011%2Cn%3A%212334111011%2Cn%3A%212334142011%2Cn%3A2241292011%2Cn%3A10222887011 ie=UTF8 qid=1419948673 ajr=2) also gets some other games shown in the sales. Among The Stars, a Sentinels expansion, GoT LCG deck. Couple others.  




 Kind of a weak sale. It's only a few dollars off what those games usually are.  




 Exactly this. Someone in my group will usually say this when someone is clearly distracted/not paying attention. It's a polite reminder of "hurry up" or "pay attention" 




 [This person really enjoys Akrotiri](http://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/2q7dkw/wsig_if_i_love_akrotiri/). That's the only post here that I see about it.

 I bought this from an Amazon sale a couple weeks ago for the same price. Finally got it to the table last night and I loved it! Played two 2 player games, then a 4 player game. Works wonderfully with both. Quick, super easy to pick up and still some good strategy and decision making to be done. The 'reserve a card' option is a neat twist.  




 The ios app is phenomenal as well. Especially if you're playing solo, saves you all the time of setting it up just for yourself.  




 The Agricola solo variant is great. 




 Wears down the surrounding area to even out surface. Then paint over.  




 What if it's obvious where it would be. For instance, went to my girlfriend's apartment and the person that lives in the next apartment who I've met twice (and is super friendly) clearly didn't remember me and introduced himself to me. Even after I said "hey Michael." Just didn't want to give him the "yea, we've met before."  









 Ditto this. I've played 2p with just the bottom section. That was better. Otherwise it's just two people playing by themselves in the same game. Map is way too big for 2 players. My favorite game of all time though. 




 JoAnne's. Michaels. Hobby Lobby. Amazon. Dollar store.  




 Uggla gets a lot of hate here (deservedly so, he was awful), but I always liked him and I'll always root for him. He never pouted, he showed up every day, and he always booked it to first on easy ground balls. I hope he catches on somewhere outside of the NL East and does well.  




 I can only speak for Agricola here...it's tough to get people into Agricola that aren't into heavy euros. Agricola is hard. If people are new to games (or only know settlers, ticket to ride or pandemic), it's a tough leap. There are more complex games, but Agricola just really beats you up, ya gotta make sure people like worker placement euros where you may feel like you didn't do shit for the last 6 turns. That said, I love Agricola. I'll play with you!

 My work computer won't allow me to download flux. Any recommendations on the RGB settings on the monitor to help with this? 




 8 hours?! Yeesh. Even with rule checking etc, sounds like you guys have a lot of analysis paralysis. I own the game, and have never had a game go over 4 hours. My recommendation: agree to a shot clock. Don't sit in the headline phase for 5 minutes agonizing over which event card to play or where to place influence etc. Set a time limit that you'll both agree to stay within to the best of your ability. And that should organically work out anyway as you get more comfortable with the game and what cards will be coming.  




 I just bought Shadow of Mordor and started the campaign last night, for a couple hours. It seems from the opening cuts that I, and my family, was killed. Now I'm just running around killing Uruk. Did I miss something? I don't really see any story or have a feel for what I'm supposed to be doing. 














 No, it wasn't salt water 




 I lent my Canon T3i to a friend for the day. As the friend was shooting he tripped, fell and plunged into a pond. My camera around his neck. He has reimbursed me for the camera but I'm wondering if there's anyway to fix the water logged one. It's been a couple months since so it's had sufficient time to dry out, but it doesn't turn or anything. Any chance I could take it somewhere to swap out a part or fix it somehow? 




 Yea, I just don't really want to spend $300 on something I'll use once a month or once every few months.  









 I'd give it a whirl. My grandparents are devour US History or Art History. My grandmother is a painter and illustrator and adores the french and dutch masters. Most of the books you'll find in their house or biographies of painters, US Presidents, Churchill, WWI, WWII or events revolving around one of those topics. I like to add to that passion and collection each Christmas.  




 They would not be into that, but I appreciate the thought.  




 I don't read a ton of non-fiction, but I do read a few a year. Every Christmas I get my grandparents a non-fiction work (lots of presidential biographies, McCollough, Kearns-Goodwin, painter bios) but this year as I walk around Barnes   Noble, all I can seem to find are celebrity memoirs or Bill O'Reilly books. Is this a total down year for history work? Is there anything worth picking up? 




 Wait...how many movies were those three movies?

 **King of Tokyo/King of New York**. It goes up to 6 and is loads of fun. I've used it a ton as a fun gateway game to people who aren't into board games at all and it's always a hit.  




 **Dead of Winter.** 

It is an overall cooperative game. You need to complete the main objective together. However, everyone also has a secret objective (none, one or some of which may be a betrayal objective) that each person needs to attempt to complete so they can individually win. It adds a lot of tension, suspicion between players (you never know if anyone has a betrayal objective or how many people may). This game is phenomenal.

 It seems like before and shortly after the release of Five Tribes, it was all the hotness. People couldn't wait for it, and then when they got it people loved it. Is it just me or since then, after people have had it for a bit, has all the buzz died? Is the replayability poor? I've been eyeing it for purchase, but now I'm not sure.

 I would not have been surprised if that was real.  
























 For people wondering if it's even harmful or not...the answer is basically yes, no and maybe. The vapor from e-cigs does contain either none or far less of the cancer causing carcinogens from traditional tobacco, but it does have higher levels of other toxins and toxic metals. What are the effects of inhaling 2nd hand vapor containing these increased volumes is the question. Science isn't totally sure yet, but they know it's not great. Here's one article of many with this content: http://www.foxnews.com/health/2014/08/29/study-second-hand-smoke-from-e-cigarettes-contains-toxic-metals/

 Yea, I agree. While the sentiment of slavery is always touchy, I think it's in how and why it's used. And I think that's why Keith Law mentions if you get offended by that stuff, maybe stay away from this game, but if you don't then you'll enjoy everything just fine.  




 Keith Law is a huge board game fan. He annually updates his [Top Board Games](http://meadowparty.com/blog/2014/11/18/top-60-boardgames/) on his personal blog. Pretty sure he did an AMA on /r/boardgames before too.

Edit: No AMA, but he commented on a [thread of his top 50 games of 2013](http://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1s9cgc/keith_laws_espn_baseball_writer_2013_list_of_his/) 









 Oh hey Snakes   Lattes employee! Do people really complain about the cover? I don't think it's unreasonable at all, especially since there's no time limit. A group of us from Buffalo come up, get there at opening on a Saturday and spend the entire day there. $5 to add gaming to my tab for all that? No complaints here. 




 Yep. Game gurus are great. Just wish they had more of them. We wanted to learn how to play Dead of Winter but the guru wouldn't teach us because it was on a list of games they aren't allowed to teach, only answer clarifying questions because of the time it takes to teach.  




 No kidding, really? I was there beginning of December, I didn't know they were adding a 2nd floor, I didn't see any construction. That's awesome.  




 I've been to Snakes   Lattes and their pub location Snakes   Lagers a bunch. Their set up, business plan and atmosphere is wonderful. And they are slammed. I live about 90 minutes from Toronto, so we usually try to make a day of it, show up first thing on a Saturday and game all day. By 2pm they're on a wait, and during peak evening hours it's probably a 2 hour wait. And the crowd is a very even mix of guys and girls. Gamers and social people. The social people are definitely the bread   butter, playing CAH, cranium and other party games. Their menu is limited, but it's good food. They do have a lot of games for sale (generally at full MSRP, but some were less). And I didn't really see anything for miniatures, but you could probably bring your own and play. They'll just charge you the regular $5 cover. We've brought a couple of our own games before.  




 Right. So your comment was doubly useless. If you fish for a man... 




 If you're going to comment on someone not having the courtesy to link to one of the previous discussions, at least have the courtesy to link to one of the previous discussions...

 I meant on superbowl sunday 




 People let loose enough as it is. SuperBowl sunday is the 2nd biggest alcohol consumption day of the year in America behind 4th of July. Ever notice, outside of certain sports   SNL, there's really no good or big budget TV on Saturdays? People don't watch TV on Saturdays. Saturdays are people's 'going-out' day/night. Sundays are traditionally a more relaxed, stay-at-home-and-watch-tv day. There are always way more viewers on Sunday. If the NFL thought for a second they would get more viewers on Saturday, then they would but the Super Bowl on Saturday

 I started following him and it's really almost always the normal pricing on Amazon or CSI or miniature market. It just looks like sales or deals because it's marked lower than MSRP 




 Ha, I've never seen so many bombs in a game. One round early in the game, our opponents each had a bomb in their hand 




 Maybe? I was high on adrenaline just recalling it. But it is a partner game of 2 v 2

 **The Battle of Tichu**

It was a bloodbath. Everything that could go wrong went wrong. Every hand loaded with 5's, 10's or Kings was bombed by our opponents. We tried to go "Grand Tichu" to hit a home run comeback. It blew up in our face. We were lost; scrambling like lost puppies in a rainstorm. We were being laughed off the table. The score was 385 to -110...but while the final battle seemed upon us, the end was not quite as close.


The tide began to turn with The Hand. Like Gandalf arriving at Helms Deep, sun parting the dark clouds of doom, it appeared in my hand to save the wretched day. Organized, the mahjong 1 card sat afar to the left...with sequential order the whole way through. A less daring Tichu has never been called. 3 tricks later, my opponent went out. Points rained upon us as our confidence boosted and our opponents began to doubt themselves for the first time. 


The next hand...fire in our eyes, we both went out before our opponents, knocking them into a stunned, scared state. Suddenly, every card played was doubted, every move questioned. They had lost their way. We could taste our moment on the horizon.


But our opponents momentarily recovered. They steadied themselves amidst the next two rounds, winning 50 and 40 points each, taking the total to 475 - 465. This would be the final battle. Possible glory for two, possible total embarrassment for our friends that would be endlessly mocked for blowing such a huge lead. 


My hand was dealt. I searched the cards for faces of Kings and Queens and Aces and Dragons. Nothing. Nothing but a lone Jack amidst a sea of small numbers. But upon closer look...a bomb of 3's. consecutive pairs of 66/77/88, three 9's and the Jack. As the beginning tricks of the round were dropped with singles, I passed. Sitting. Waiting for my moment. The perfect hand to bomb. It never came. A fair hand passed that my opponent would take, but it was bombed and lost. Our opponent was down to 4 cards. It was now or never, he played a pair of Q's. I bombed. And then readied myself for the final strike. 66/77/88. No one could match. Three 9's. No one could best them. And then I dropped the lone Jack, ridding all my cards first. The last out gave me their taken tricks and remaining cards. We counted the the final tally. It was victory for us. From the brink of defeat. From -110 points below our starting due to failed tichu's and thwarted hands, we rose and conquered our dear friends. And have laughed at them ever since.  









 Game store is different from cafe though. Game store needs people to come stay to entice them to buy their games on stock. Cafs have a very different business model and they're not selling those games on hand.  




 This is definitely the most common way. I haven't seen one that didn't, although there certainly may be. Snakes   Lattes in Toronto, perhaps the most famous board game cafe, has this model. Sit   stay as long as you want, play as many games as you want...it's $5 a person added to your bill for the gaming in addition to your food/drink.  




 **Wits   Wagers** is always fun! It's not too much pressure for knowing trivia since you get points by betting on whatever guess you want. I would definitely try to stick to vocally interactive games like many party games or CAH. Co-Op games like **Pandemic** would work nicely as well. **Pandemic The Cure** is a little lighter too if you can get it. 




 Ha, I literally just checked OLGS's and, for the first time, z-man's site and saw they had it there! $50 + shipping is real steep for an expansion. Hopefully this hits distributors or amazon prime soon. I can't wait. TM is my favorite game.  




 Games in this list that I can speak to...

**Firefly: The Game** is not good at all. It hits some nostalgic notes if you're a fan of the series, but if you take that out of the equation, the game falls very flat. I wouldn't go with this.

**Splendor** is such a good game. The mechanics are extremely simple (you either take tokens, buy a card or reserve a card), but you'll find a good amount of strategy, interesting decisions and replayability with it. And it's quick to play, and scales well for 2-4. 


**Lords of Vegas** is loads of fun. Has some good strategy to it as well, with lots of fun twists. This game is somewhat dependant on your group...for instance I have a couple guys in my group that always love to take the risky options in games for the hell of it, so that makes this game a blast every time. It's such a fun time.


And if you like co-op, **Robinson Crusoe** is an absolute masterpiece and a must-own for any big co-op fan. 




 Did those board game shelves become a mini wall separating the rooms? That's some serious dedication.  




 Good stuff. I have all my games organized vertically, so stuff is always going everywhere. Which model of the Really Useful Boxes did you use? 




 Jamie from The Secret Cabal Podcast just got this. [Their Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/thesecretcabal) has a bunch of recent posts   pictures of the game. I have no idea what gameplay is like, but the miniatures and board look unbelievable.  




 What about **Super Dungeon Explore**?

/u/r2d8 getinfo 




 Yes...once :)  




 I've never played Xia, but lots of games have first play scenario's and I always say get outta my face first play scenarios, i'm playing the real game.  




 Talk about box art that does not match the game at all. Those are some colorful tiles, pieces and cards. Wasn't expecting that. How is this game? Sitting at pretty solid 7.5/10 on bgg 




 That could be true. I also think there's a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy with established high ranked games. People pick them up because the see the rating and want to like it too because they think they're supposed to. Obviously they're all tremendous games, but there could be a bit of that too. I know I can give high ranked games more of a chance after a bad play because I know they're supposed to be very good.  




 Can't get it to play at work. Can anyone provide the run down? 




 Thanks! Also, how necessary are airbrushes? I've watched a few tutorials, they almost all use airbrushes, but it's out of my price range for starting out.  




 If you screw up painting a mini, is it pretty easy to "start over?" Give it a new primer coating and start over?  




 Why are you saying it that way?

*Saying whhat whhat whay?* 




 I'm not looking to become a master, just get some pizazz into mini's I have in some table top board games. I've looked into some starter kits, and I'm ready to pull the trigger, I just don't want to waste my time if it's something you really need some skill for. 




 Absolutely spot on. Great advice 




 When was who started being sarcastic first a question? I was. I'm usually sarcastic. You're just a downer. As I said before...lighten up 




 Welcome to the Internet where talking to friends about your interests is desperate lol. Good grief, dude. Lighten up.  




 You must be fun at parties. I'm well aware I didn't describe my intrinsic motivation for why I want to tell people about board games.  




 You know what I meant. I'm not being exclusive about the games. It was just for brevity in the title.  




 Great idea. This just usually comes up at parties when the conversation turns to hobbies or something. Can't exactly whip out Bruges from my back pocket. But the keep it short and sweet to theme and general mechanics is a good idea. It gets more difficult when I get the question "well what's your favorite game?" And I have to explain Terra Mystica..."well it's an economy and area control game where everyone place a mythical race, trying to terraform land and build buildings..." and then I lose them haha 




 Well he was just someone that rushed to 'oh D D' and clearly then had no interest in what I was saying. But other people, in general, have literally no concept of these games and just don't understand, keep asking for examples of games (that they'll never know about). I was just wondering what people do to explain the games to those people, short of making them watch a video or bust out a game for them. 




 There are lots of business planning and budgeting tools on the internet for start ups, especially cafes. All you'd have to do is take a look at those and then add however much you want to spend on stocking games   shelves.  




 I was trying to explain Dead of Winter to a co-worker and within 15 seconds he says "sounds like Dungeons   Dragons." People seem to always ask 'are these games like monopoly? risk? clue? or go off the other side and think it's D D. I usually end up just saying they have lots of strategy and victory points and they shrug, still not getting it.  




 Sure! Like anything, if people can easily find you and if you provide a unique insight while being entertaining, people will follow you. I think the most important part (outside of being able to be easily found) is to provide your own unique perspective. I watch a lot of video reviewers like SU SD, Watch It Played, Rahdo and Dice Tower and they all offer their own experience and angles. Be unique. Find your own angle that works for you, reflects who you are and is genuine. If it's good, people will stay. 


edit: and to some of your questions - for me, nothing makes me fall asleep quicker in a blog than extensive rule run summaries. If I wanted in depth rules, I'd read the manual. I'd say if you're doing a full review, maybe stick to a brief overview of the theme, object and basic gameplay mechanics. 




 What about [**Amerigo**](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/137408/amerigo) or [**Lewis   Clark**](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/140620/lewis-clark)? Honestly, I haven't played either, but they're based around discovery   expansion (I think) 




 Well, I guess it's sci-fi but **Eclipse** pretty much starts with nothing but a few center hexes and you explore off those. And it's an awesome game.  




 Yea, I'm pretty sure we played the game half a dozen times before realizing that.  




 As long as they are connected via Carpet Ride ability (same for Dwarves with tunnelling), it counts for end game scoring of connected settlements. It does not count for creating a town. 

It's like how indirect connection counts for end-game scoring, but not for creating a Town.  




 Oh wow...the game itself isn't similar at all to Terra Mystica. In TM you have direct   indirect interaction where you're cutting people off for land and building adjacent with money/power/vp exchanges. TM isn't the most interactive game, but it definitely has interaction, especially with 4-5 people, and 3 as well to a lesser extent. Castles of Mad King Ludwig has none of that. Each player has his own play area where you're building your castle. And unlike Suburbia where you can get bonuses based on what other's have built, in Castles you only get bonuses/penalties for what's in your Castle. The main interaction in Castles comes from the auction block. The "Master Builder" (which rotates like a 1st player marker) gets to take the 5/6/7 room tiles and arrange them in any order he wants on the auction block (ranging from $2k, $4k, $6k etc). So if you see people really need a certain room type, you may want to make it more expensive so they have to pay (and pay you, the master builder), but maybe not too expensive so no one buys it. So there's some interesting decisions to make on how you organize the auction block, trying to predict what people need and what they will or can buy.  




 numbers are also language independent

Edit: I'm wrong. Please ignore my comment and feel free to mock my wrongness.  




 You can also combine Cyclades and Kemet with an expansion, correct?  




 If you have access to a workshop, maybe you could cut the meeple (or something boardgame related) out of wood, stain/paint it and mount it on a trophy platform.  




 I haven't played Cyclades but Kemet and Eclipse are both owned by my group and hit the table regularly. **Eclipse** is one of my all time favorite games. I love the scope of the game, the economy management and the various legitimate paths to victory. It always feels like an epic game. On **Kemet**, I'm just not a huge fan. I really want to like this game and I get why people do, but it just hasn't clicked for me. Every game I play it feels like everyone is just ramping their stuff up and, bam, the game is over all of a sudden.  









 Oh man, I can't wait. That's the one I'm most excited for. Castles was just easier to get to the table. We've had Suburbia for awhile so it didn't take long at all to learn the rules. I just haven't had time to go through the Brass book and/or watch some walkthrough videos. I can't wait to play it though.  




 I think any time a game has custom pieces at all it's awesome. Custom D6? Sweet. Custom meeples? Awesome. Custom non-plastic money? Fantastic. It just shows an attention to care and quality in the game. The main reasoning for wanting Xia: Legends of a Drift System is because of all the custom miniature ships, metal coins and dice.  




 Agree with all this. The one thing I'd say about Trajan is that there are a ton of things you *can* worry about, but you're always best to stick to one strategy as much as possible. I think in a 2P game, construction is the dominant strategy. Then shipping overall. I haven't found a way to go all-in on Military as much as possible and win though.  




 I very much dislike Catan. Our group just played it death years ago. Once in a blue moon someone will suggest we play Catan and it gets to the table. If it does, I always put in Cities   Knights to add some depth to it. And without fail, about halfway through the game I think "why the hell did I suggest this? this will never end." Every damn time. I'll never learn.  




 The one thing I'll say about Feld games is they all scale very well. **Trajan** is a brilliant game, and I love playing it 2P. **Bruges** is a masterpiece, best with 3-4, but still very very enjoyable with 2. **Bora Bora** also goes well with 2P, albeit it probably shines more with 3-4 due to the meanness of blocking actions.  




 Yea, I've heard it balances it out. I'll have to tell my friend to pick it up.  




 Yea, I'm not sure if this one has a feature mechanic like the Trajan mancala wheel, or how dice are used in CoB or Bora Bora. I watched Rahdo's run through and he mentioned that as well, but still really liked it and talked about some of the unique things the game does as a whole.


And it does look really nice. 




 I got a brand new shipment of **Brass**, **Castles of Mad King Ludwig**, and **1775: Rebellion** in from Amazon, but was able to only play CoMKL of that group. I really like this game. We have Suburbia in our group as well, and our group does tend to lean on heavier games, but Suburbia just always felt fiddly to me...easy to mess up with erring on adjusting scores across red lines and missing a tile on someone's board. Castles really streamlines all that and the theme is much more fun. We laughed at each other's castles and made ridiculous kingly declarations as we built. Loved it. 


Also got my all-time favorite game in, **Terra Mystica.** 4 players, I finished a distant second as the Dwarves, with the Fakirs cruising to victory. Fakirs used their Carpet Ride ability to grab the 18 point bonus at the end for biggest land mass, and they had 3 of the 4 cult tracks. Tons of end game scoring for them, very well played. This game is just so good with 4 people. I love it.


Had some lighter fare as well. Busted out a couple games of **Splendor.** I really enjoy this with 2P. I think it highlights the 'reserving a card' as you can use it a bit more defensively if you see someone grabbing coins obviously for a card that fits it. Very simple game with great replay-ability and solid depth.

I played **Machi Koro** for the first time. It was...meh? It didn't really grab me. I got a few cafes and the building stealing card and cruised. I'll play it again if people want but wouldn't recommend it.

And finally, in the Dice Chucker theme, this fits right in...I got a co-op game of my favorite dice chucker game...**Fortune   Glory!** This game is stupid fun. Traveling around, rolling dice, killin nazi's, finding treasure. It's awesome if you don't take it seriously and just have a good time with it. I've always leaned towards heavier euros, and cared more about mechanics than theme, but this game just grabbed me from the start with its Indiana Jones nostalgia, miniatures, funky artwork, I dig it.  




 That is a fantastic collection. Very similar tastes to mine...lots of games I have and even more that I want! 

How is **Aquasphere**? I'm a big Feld fan so I can't wait to pick it up. I've heard it's very brain-burnery.  




 There is basically no theme. I guess you're building a castle manor with some animals and knowledge and ships and buildings? I've played this game hundreds of times (often online at boiteajeux.net) and I freaking love it. It's in my top 10 of all time for sure. It scales wonderfully from 2-4 people. It's simple mechanics, a fair bit of depth   strategy and lots of replayability with the different mats and randomization of when the tiles come out. It is a superb game. As everyone here will say, how the dice are used is really neat. It's a bit of luck sometimes what you roll, but with the workers and some knowledge tiles you can mitigate that and keep your long term strategy. It's fantastic.  




 Yea man, definitely not a slur. Dice Tower has some video reviews talking about the best ameritrash games of all time. And other podcasts similarly so as well 




 I just got Castles of Mad King Ludwig today! I'm unboxing it now. I'm really looking forward to it. I liked Suburbia but it was always a bit fiddly for me, checking other people's boards, making sure you're adjusting your income/population for every red line you cross. I like the theme much more in Castles, and I think it's streamlined some of that fiddliness.  




 Haha I'll give you that  




 I don't think it's insulting to call things ameritrash. Maybe for some people it is, I guess. That's just the name that got dumped on it really. I love me some ameritrash. Fortune   Glory is one of my all time favorites. I lean to euros usually, but sometimes it's just great to have go nuts in ameritrash  




 That's what's up /u/Starving_Fartist. I thought you were super new to games based on what your said about your collection, so I was just making a very simplified statement about the genres of games.  




 No, you're right. I'm the one getting angry and defensive lol. Have a good day on the internet! 




 Forgot to ask...you have both Suburbia and Castles of Mad King Ludwig...which do you like best? 




 That's a corgi, not a doge. 




 Yes, Mr. Thesaurus, I was making generalizations about the genres. I never said that ameritrash games couldn't have strategy. Those are what the genres are. Ameritrash - heavy on theme/experiences/randomness - Euros heavy on mechanics/strategy. Are there exceptions? Of course there are. Like anything in the world.  




 As you get deeper into board games, especially once you delve into medium to heavy weight euros, you'll see the thematic elements wane and strategy/mechanic elements increase. Some people love that. Some people look for board games to be more of a thematic elements aka "ameritrash" games. You may just prefer those types of games right now; lots of randomness, look, story telling, immersion and theme.

Try games like **Fortune   Glory**, **Betrayal at House on the Hill**, **Zombicide**, **Last Night On Earth**, **Nexus Ups** and many more. Those are all very heavy thematic and games with more of an immersion into the experience and theme.  




 [Hotels booked through GenCon](http://gencon.com/attend/hotelmap) 




 Actual question...have you ever travelled? Those are pretty much always the most expensive parts of any trip. How you spend money on daily activities/food/souvenirs is totally up to you.  




 Great collection! We have near identical tastes in games, my collection looks a lot like that, and ones you have that I don't are all on my wishlist. What's your favorite game there? Any regrets? 




 I think that's the opposite of the question... 




 For me, it would be **Eclipse.** You see a thousand ships, tiles for tech   science and resource cubes abound, but really when it comes down to it, all you're doing is choosing one of a few actions each turn til you can't do it anymore. Explore, research, attack etc. The mechanics are pretty straight forward once you know what you're doing.  




 The autosave files continually get corrupted and screw the game up every time. I can't find anywhere in the game to disable it 




 So we're just making fun of little people now? Calling them dwarves and laughing because they're on a spyder? How the fuck is that funny? 




 Maybe you should be on your conference call instead of posting to reddit.  




 Great explanation. Thanks a lot! 




 Yea, reading/watching some stuff on Xia just now is where I saw that term. Hadn't heard it before.  









 Some good work put in by /r/boardgames the last two days. I think we killed B N's and ThinkGeek's stock pretty quickly in back to back days 









 haha deal...Eminent Domain, Dead of Winter, Race for the Galaxy, Mice   Mystics, Suburbia, Manhattan Project, Power Grid and Sentinels of the Multiverse are yours :)  




 Wow, I've never really taken a look at all the components. Those are gorgeous! They come pre-painted like that? I'd say worth it. Crap, now I want to spend $85. Damn you.  




 ooo where did you get Xia? It's crazy expensive on Amazon right now. Did you just take the plunge or find a deal somewhere? 




 Great collection! Feel free to send me 1-80 games! 




 [Hmmm](http://i.imgur.com/cI8IHaS.png) 




 Haha nice! I love how we can rationalize game purchases. I've picked up Brass, Castles of Mad King Ludwig   1775: Rebellion in a CSI purchase and now Dead of Winter. All in the past week. I'll have so much unboxing to do, I'm so excited haha. 




 Yea it's not good! This was purchase #4 for me already haha.

 When you say "find a Kingdom," what does 'Kingdom' refer to? A strategy for your deck? 




 If you're leaving the board set, playing asynchronously, **Castles of Burgundy** might not be bad if you have the room. It plays great with 2 people, and it's not bad to play asynchronously as you can always see everything on the board. Just takes a second to remind yourself what your strategy is at.   




 A lot of the games deal with history, but producers Academy Games and GMT Games really focus on educational aspects for their publications. Not sure how many are geared towards younger audiences though.  




 So, 52 games a year?! 




 That doge on the left is definitely familiar with the cheese drawer. 




 I own both **Jamaica** and **Formula D.** Jamaica is definitely not my favorite game. It's super light with very little strategy or skill. Lots of luck. But it's fun with the right group and good gateway or filler game after a brain-burner. 

I really like Formula D. Again, there is a good amount of luck, but there is some strategy and push your luck mechanics that make it more exciting. It's a lot of fun to see your friends try to push for the perfect roll and blow their car up.  




 Can I have it? 




 how about The Duke? It's chess-like, with a few twists...mainly flipping the tiles after you move them to give a new move pattern for that tile. And a turn option to grab a tile from your tile bag to place on the board. It's a lot of fun. One of my favorite 2 player games. 




 Nice. Is it still fun for the person who is the mastermind? 




 When you say mastermind...that's one of the players as well, right? Not just the mechanics of the game itself? 




 The art turned me off right away. I'm just not into anime at all. But I recently listened to a Secret Cabal podcast where they talked about it and, to their surprise, loved it. What are your thoughts on Tragedy Looper if you've played it? 




 Pretty sure I said my question was answered. Generally Amazon doesn't have identical things fulfilled by Prime with very different prices. So, yes, I'm quite familiar.  




 I hear ya. I hope I didn't come across as cynical, I was genuinely curious in the process!  




 Good luck with everything!

Question for you: how do you think something like this will do on indiegogo/kickstarter. The traditional product on this is something that the consumer can get or receive (i.e. a boardgame, toy, music, electronic etc), but as a brick   mortar store, only someone in your area could physically benefit from this. Why, besides out of sheer generosity, would someone outside your area be compelled to support this? Or are you simply expecting the support and funds to come directly from the Beverly area?

 Ah, ok...so is there any actual difference in the games? Or just how amazon priced the 1st edition Artipia and the second edition that stronghold came on board with? 




 Well they're both amazon prime and both say 'by Stronghold Games' beneath the title. That's why I was confused.

On the top row, I understand the middle is the expansion, but why is one Among The Stars listed as $29, and the other at $41? Just weird product coding by Amazon? There's no difference with the one that says Card Game, right?

 Hey, I live in Buffalo! Where is this? Great shot 




 I dig Trajan a lot. It scales well from 2-4 and I think different strategies are highlighted with different player counts. From what I've seen, construction can be very dominant 2p, but easily gets congested. Shipping can be great or working the political track. I love it. One of those games where you want to do everything, but really need to maximize one or two specialities the best you can to win

 Hallelujah by Jeff Buckley. I know it's done a lot, but it gets me every time. Especially in the West Wing scene it appears in.  




 I did that yesterday. It was rock solid ice. I hurt my toe. I was totally fine...but ouch.   




 nothing in this has anything to do with social awkward or awesomeness. 

maybe if there was a good tutor/poor tutor tucan meme you could use that.  




 oh good grief...lying??? He's telling a specific story of Chris Kyle. If anything short of telling the entire story is a lie than every movie should just be a 400 hour documentary of whatever war they're focusing on.  




 I don't see here what makes me wrong. I was reacting to 1. the quote in the link trivializing and marginalizing soldier's emotions and reactions to war; and 2. on why the movie was and to what aspect of war it chose to focus on. I never said that war movies have no affect on their audience. That's an entirely different debate of whether that is a responsibility film makers should choose to bear or not. Similar to 'athletes have influence on youth, thus they should be required to act like a role model' whether that athletes cares to or not. Clint Eastwood wanted to make a movie about Chris Kyle's life. What people think when they leave the movie is up to them. But it's not wrong to make the movie.  




 Unless this was your ex's shirt or some custom mall t-shirt with a spray painted caricature of the two of you banging that she got for you, this doesn't matter at all.   




 Then I suggest you spend a day at a facility that treats soldiers with injuries and PTSD. Try telling one of those people who put their life on the line to do what they thought was right in fighting terrorists that they're "warmongers" and undeserving of empathy.  




 That's fair, but it doesn't really say anything about slavery or black history month. Whether a slave owner treated slaves with kindness or cruelty is like saying a murderer tortured his victims first or executed them with a painless lethal injection. It's wrong either way.  




 "Wrong people" is a completely subjective opinion. The director of this movie wanted to focus on what a soldier (who I'm pretty sure is an "actual" person) goes through, so he focused on exactly the right person. There are other movies that focus on the citizens of a war torn area. If you prefer those, that's fine. But don't say something is wrong or broken because it looks at an immensely and impossibly large scope through a specific lens to tell the story they want to tell.  




 well shit...someone direct me to the burn unit 




 Welcome to 5th grade french class. 




 This again? Shit like this comes up every war movie. Remove the political biases from it and whatever motives governments may or may not have had to enter a war and continue a war. It's a movie. Soldiers enlist for many different reasons, and during their service, yes, things "make them sad" and a million other feelings as well. Humans enjoy seeing stories about the human emotion; at heart we are empathetic creatures, and are pulled to stories that pull that out of us. People like this "comedian" are infuriating.  




 I'm 90% sure that the Jewish Community Center has racquetball courts.  




 I live in Buffalo, NY so I have some insight. Buffalo has an insane amount of infrastructure to prepare for winter conditions. The city and each surrounding town has an incredible number of plows and salt storehouses. They can clear highways and main roads in no time. 2 feet of snow on a Tuesday night? Bet your ass you're going to school on Wednesday morning. 

Other cities just don't have the infrastructure for it and, just as devastatingly, people don't know how to drive in the conditions, which clog up roads so those few plows that do exist can't get through. It basically comes to cost for these cities: is it worth it to purchase millions of dollars of plows, storehouses, salt stock and pay workers for the 1 storm a year or every few years? Generally, no

 New York City is a city within New York State. New York is a state just like Texas, California, Florida, Minnesota, etc. It'd be like if Paris was called France City...if France was a state. 


[Here's a good map of the 5 Boroughs](https://villagillet.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/ny1.png). The Boroughs are basically just districts in the metropolitan area of NYC.

 [This site](http://www.netstate.com/states/tables/state_millionaires.htm) shows, from 2006 data, 368,388 millionaires in NYS (with 2006 census at 19.1M population) and 33.6 out of 1000 households. That's about 1.9% of the population and 3.36% of households.

 What? Yes they did. They got the top forward. If/when they finish last year which is extraordinarily likely, they are guaranteed McDavid or Eichel 




 Would this be good to listen to as an audiobook? 




 I'll take that bet everyday of the week. I will also take the team with the #1 farm system in hockey, is about to get McDavid or Eichel and didn't just trade away their only talented forward. But way to come in to another city's sub, politely chime in with your thoughts then turn into a dick when you're rebutted. That'll work out nicely for you in life.  




 hahahaha. Good luck with that. Enjoy the next time you lose your franchise.  




 It's the price of doing business. We're not trading the lottery pick. We have 3 first round picks this year. The other two we got from the Isles   Blues. Those will likely be very late picks. We're giving up the lowest one.  




 It's definitely a lot. But there was a lot of teams calling for Kane. Make a move to get your target, I guess. Trades are usually at a higher cost when it's not right up against the trade deadline. I'll miss Armia   Lemieux, but I think we have enough similar guys to fill in fine 




 But enjoy Armia and Lemieux. Both will be fun to watch. Armia should be up, in your top 6 next year. Has grown a lot this past year and is, by all account, a great kid. Lemieux will be a solid 2nd or 3rd line power forward. Loves to hit and has good hands. 50 points and 120 PIM in 46 games in Barrie this year.  




 Boston said the same for Seguin. He's doing ok for Dallas. 

And regardless of where you stand in the trade, if you think our GM and brass didn't do proper research when pulling off a trade like this, you're delusional. Is it a risk? Maybe. But "attitude" stuff is so overblown. Seguin got run out of Boston because he partied and supposedly had a bad attitude. If Kane scores 30 goals, I don't care where he travels to.  




 From a quick google search...Places with NHL Farm System Rankings:

Sabres #1 in all of these sites. 




 You know the farm system isn't just Rochester, right? The Sabres farm system is ranked #1 in the NHL right now in terms of prospects. Sam Reinhart, Justin Bailey, Hudson Fasching, JT Compher, Connor Hurley, Mark Pysyk, Jake McCabe, Johan Larsson, and until today Joel Armia and Brendan Lemieux.  




 Nope, I like it. Our farm system is loaded with talent on the level of Armia   Lemiuex. And we got proven elite NHL talent in Kane. You have to pay for that. Hurts to send away Armia   Lemieux, but that's been the plan all along. Acquire as many prospects and picks as possible and use those assets to trade for proven young talent and get as close to the top of the draft as possible. Elite talent wins.  









 ok cool, just wanted to make sure. Don't have much theater going experience and I hate sitting front at movies, so I wasn't sure if that would correlate. Appreciate it 




 How is the pit? Too close? Looks like it's only rear balcony, or the pit or way off to the sides in the lower area 




 I was looking at tickets for upcoming shows and I was wondering about seat suggestions. There's nothing available in the front orchestra areas, except to the far sides. There's a few in the pit, the "loge" and then rear balcony. I'd go for the pit, but I'm not sure if that's too close, like sitting front row at imax? 




 **Quantum** is an abstract strategy game. **The Duke** isn't a euro but still has a lot of strategy and decision making. **Tash-Kalar: Arena of Legends** is highly ranked under bgg abstract games.

 No, he hasn't.  No, he won't.  




 **Castles of Mad King Ludwig** is loads of fun. I like it better than Suburbia as it's less fiddly without the population/income tracks   checking other peoples' towns. Plus the theme is great. Castles are awesome! And the Master Builder mechanic adds some nice depth and strategy to it. Easy to get to the table, easy to teach and fun to play for newbies or experienced gamers.


Of everything you listed, **Dominant Species** would be the hardest to get the table. It's heavy and a really long game. Can easily be 4 hours. 


**Terra Mystica** might be hard if people aren't into heavy games. This game is heavy. There are a lot of rules and sometimes they're a bit scattered in the rulebook. That said, it's #2 or 3 on bgg for a reason. It's a masterpiece of a boardgame. Everything works together wonderfully, it looks incredible and has loads of replayability.


**Machi Koro** is definitely light, but it is fun. If you get this, get the Harbor Expansion with it. It evens out some of the OP strategy. 


For Co-Op, you can't go wrong with Pandemic. It's a classic, and you can uprade the difficulty if you want to to make it more challenging. Same with lots of Co-ops.  




 Well, which is it? Are you suspicious or are you him? 




 At least in America, I find far too many dry scrambled eggs. People leave the eggs in the skillet, still, as they harden, then they flip and break em up a bit, like they were making a diced omelet. For me, the key is to constantly keep stirring them. Keeps any part from cooking too long and ensures optimal moistness throughout.

 I've heard the new expansion rewards large spread footprints for end game scoring so races that tend to have smaller settlements like Dwarves or Engineers are at a bit of a disadvantage there 




 So what does that mean if you have them in the box? Just throw them out? 




 Yea, a bit. Still a risk/reward of driving someone up on the price I guess. Are the designers working on any rule changes to balance it out? 




 Seems the Shapeshifters are the one imbalanced thing here. Does the bidding balance it out at all? 




 This is the only time I've ever heard something negative about the expansion. I just picked this up now as TM is my favorite game. Only things I've heard is that this takes a great game and makes it even better.

 2nd floor of Pearl St would be perfect. I believe they can also reserve that area for parties. It's really not off the beaten path anymore. More and more is down there. Incorporate some of the nearby canalside stuff if you can.
