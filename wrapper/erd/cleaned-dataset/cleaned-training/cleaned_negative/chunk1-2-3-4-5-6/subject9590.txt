 equals one of my balls being the size of a clementine  




 Thanks for the figurative slap in the face you are right but emotions are powerful things 




 Think I'm gonna retaliate with doxycyclin and learning from this experience sorry to disappoint you 




 This seems to be the general consensus of the thread and I would like to thank all of you for not letting my emotions get the better of me 




 Drunk plus how good sex feels without a condom equals I'm a dumbass 




 I let my emotions get the better of me cause I'm fucking pissed off. Everyone in this thread is right doing anything to him is childish and not going to change anything in the long run 




 Then I find out I'm a horrible judge of character and lose faith in humanity 




 A little fucking callous but you make good points. 




 You could be completely right but I'm usually a very untrusting person because I have had the shit manipulated out of me before. She has proven herself to me thus far but of course she could just be a manipulative bitch and be incredibly good about it. If i find out that's true goddamn I don't know if I could trust anyone ever again. 




 Like I said i trust her a lot and I'm usually a very cynical person. You could definitely be right but I think I'm a good judging people and she has proven herself to me though. But everyone in this thread saying to be the better man are correct. I'm letting my emotions get the better of me. 




 She figured out he was cheating on her about a week after she had gotten an STD test and was clean. She dumped him immediately afterwards and we met about month later. I now have chlamydia and epididymitis because of an admittedly lapse in judgement on my part(bareback).

Her last boyfriend was obviously a huge piece of shit. I trust her story 100% because she got an IUD and had to get tested before that. I had also gotten tested recently and the only girl I have fucked since then is her. I am 99.9999% sure that I am the only guy she has fucked since the breakup, we have a very open and trusting relationship.

I just found out about the STD so obviously emotions are running pretty high. He not only cheated on this girl that I care for a lot but also gave us both chlamydia. What would you do in this situation reddit?

**EDIT**: One of the first times reddit has actually been productive for me instead of counterproductive. Y'all are right I am letting my emotions getting the better of me and this is mostly my fault

 I suggest watch the documentary When you're strange. It's narrated by Johnny Depp and tell the story of the Doors in a very entertaining way. Although I guess you'd have to fuck up hard to make something about Jim Morrison's life not entertaining.

If you like that read the biography No One Here Gets Out Alive

 Let's face it, this school is fucking hard... especially when professors refuse to give out practice tests or only give out one(*cough* physics department *cough*). I think it would benefit everyone if we put together a r/gatech word server where anyone could upload materials from classes they previously took(like a fraternity or sorority word). I could probably set something up if there's any interest... 




 Oh all the time. One time a few friends and I were tripping on acid and we decided to throw milkdrop up on one of the projectors. Got a few weird looks from the kids trying to study(fucking nerds) but it was a great experience 




 I don't think reddit would benefit from people ignoring this so much as not misinterpreting it. It's not saying plagiarize and copy, it's saying take things that speak to you from various sources and make them your own.

 For some reason, my hands and feet sweat excessively at all times. Even as I'm typing this now, I can feel the grimy, clammy sweat building up on my hands and it's really uncomfortable. This always makes handshakes pretty awkward, I definitely would be pretty grossed out if I shook someone's hand only to find it wet with sweat. Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this? Of course I know the ol' wipe your hands on your pants trick, but that just doesn't quite cut it for me any more...

I can do a decent posh accent(or so I've been told by actual british people) and I've thought about just one day starting to talk in a british accent and never stopping. Sure I'd loose all my friends probably but eventually I could make new friends who wouldn't know I'm actually american. I'd get so many more chicks that way it'd be awesome 




 Hmmm, how about saying it was an interesting movie made me think about things I never would have thought about before? Does that make me sound stupid?
 









 Jim Morrison for sure 




 Yeah, he has a ton of really mind blowing videos. My favorite is where he somehow subconsciously convinces like 30 mall goers to raise their hands in the air at the same time with just a few announcements over the loudspeaker.

Honestly, I can't help but be skeptical that he didn't stage some of his videos but everything I've watched paints him as a honest down to earth guy who wouldn't stage things just to increase his ratings.

Here's the video if anyone's interested: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOEKdaXIEHc

 Get outside man. Go hiking or something. Go look at nature and try to comprehend the trillions of complex organic reactions that are occurring right before your eyes.

 Wow I never knew how much of an asshole Edison was. Electrocuting an elephant in front of a crowd of people proves nothing and I'm sure he knew that, its just the general public didn't have much of an understanding of electricity at the time.

 I don't get this viewpoint at all. Technology has progressed enough so that things like instant replay can be used in soccer. Sure coming up with rules so that this could be implemented without drastically changing the game play will take a bit of thought but I believe it is possible. 

In this world cup, in almost every single game I've watched, the refs have made at least one bad call that would have been overturned by an instant replay. Why would you resist trying to make the game more fair? That goal England scored yesterday would have drastically changed the game. The disputed goal this article talks about would have drastically changed the game. 

Change is a good thing if it's done right.

 I took a 4000 level intro to neuroscience class last semester and it blew my mind. What defines 'you', your personality, inhibitions, vocabulary and memory is in fact tangible and malleable.

 Yeah mental illness scares the fuck out of me, I read a story here from a paramedic send to a girls house by her mother because she was having an episode again.

He walked into the house and found the girl sitting by herself in the living room. Apparently as he walked in she stared at him for about 30 seconds and that stood up completely inhuman way that he said looked like something a human could never do. She then said something along the lines of I am the devil incarnate. She then held her hand up in way it seemed like she was holding something and said to him I Hold here the key to enter the gates of hell and walked up to him.
He has absolutely no belief in the supernatural and he still said it was the scariest thing that has ever happened to him and it still freaks him the fuck out to this day. 




 So say the main character of this game is a paranoid schizophrenic. For example maybe he is the only person in this world to have telekinesis or something along these lines and despite his mental illness he has to overcome it to save the world. You would have to deal with that, all along dealing with things like hearing voices, hallucinations and other paranoid schizophrenic presents. You wouldn't be able to tell what was real and what wasn't although maybe there would be a subtle ability to recognize a pattern to get to the bottom of this. The game would be a total mind fuck but it would be really interesting to deal with problems and eye opening for people who don't know much about this disease 




 I think you should reread my post man. Dont think you fully understood it

 So recently I've been on a huge comedy kick and I'm looking for more shows to keep this bender going. I love seinfeld and curb, WLIIA, scrubs, seasons 2-12 of the Simpsons, Aqua Teen Hunger Force, Metalocalypse, squidbillies, superjail, venture bros, and a ton more there's no need to list. As you can see my tastes are really diverse and I'm open to anything, recommend me a hilarious new show and you won't regret it. 

I also love british humor  




 Would that entertain you for eternity though or would you eventually get tired of it? I remember in the movie trainspotting they described the the feeling of shooting up heroin as far better than any orgasm you will ever have. This would be the exact same thing everyday and it just makes me wonder would you eventually get bored of pure bliss? 




 I always thought if I was groundhog dayed I would try a bunch of crazy drugs I would never try otherwise. I specifically thought of H, I've dabbled in opiates, even took OCs a couple times but never tried heroin. But in your predicament, you might as well make the best of it.


There are no downsides, you can't OD, you can't build up a tolerance, no money worries, etc. So I was wondering from people who have tried this, would doing heroin all day everyday make you feel good enough that you wouldn't mind being stuck in one day over and over again for an unimaginable amount of time? I think the writers of groundhog day said Bill Murray spent about 9000 years in his day. 


Of course psychedelics would be really fucking interesting too and many other drugs would be a lot of fun but I have a feeling that it'd be kinda hard to find those in Puxatony.

 I'll do my best to explain a 4D cube(hypercube). First we'll relate the 2nd and 3rd dimensions because it is much easier to comprehend. We begin with a 2D square, this is simple enough it exists in only the x and y planes. To get a 3D cube from a square, we draw another square with the same x and y coordinates but change the z coordinate. Now you have two squares, one above the other, and you can simply connect all the vertices to form a cube.

A cube exists in the x, y and z planes which intersect at 90 degree angles with each other. To get to the fourth dimension we need to add another plane which still intersects with the x, y and z plane at a 90 degree angle. I personally can't imagine what this looks like, I'm not sure if it's even possible for us to comprehend it, but mathematically it is possible. Lets call this fourth dimension w for simplicity's sake. A hypercube is simply two cubes with the same x, y and z coordinates, separated in the w direction, and connected at the vertices. Mathematically simple to describe, but a bitch to imagine.  




 I think common sense predicts that 




 It would probably be well before that actually... 




 DUH 




 Yeah I've thought about what a 4D object would be like quite a bit. The 4th dimension would be a direction that is perpendicular to the up and down, left and right, and away and towards directions(x, y, and z). A 4D creature observing us would be able to see all sides of us along with everything inside of us all at once. 

If, say a 4D sphere were to pass through our world, to us it would look like a small sphere that appears out of nowhere and could even hang in midair, gradually gets bigger until it reaches a maximum size and then shrinks and disappears. The easiest way I've found to even kind of understand is to imagine us observing/interacting with a 2D world and kind extrapolate what it would be like to the interactions between a 4D world and a 3D world. 

Carl Sagan has a great video I'm sure you can find on youtube where he explains the 4th dimensions with the poetic yet scientific style he was famous for.  




 I always thought those were called hyper-cubes... but yeah thats four spacial dimensions. I have no idea what the fuck three time demensions would be like.

One spacial dimension is easy enough to imagine however but it's hard to even think of time as a dimension, how the hell can you have 3D time? Such a mind fuck  




 Here's what NASA has to say about it. Still not much explaination though

http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/about/information/science_faq.html#36 




 One of the reasons I posted this is I was hoping someone could explain it. Although I doubt it's possible for our brains to comprehend three time dimensions, it's hard enough trying to imagine a fourth spacial dimension. 




 Yeah I know right, I definitely can comprehend this it's so simple and intuitive!

 One good topic is how good at parallel parking I am. Always a great conversation starter 




 I'm about to be 23 years old and I've been depressed since about 14 or 15. At first I really had no reason to be depressed, I had a good group of friends, was part of the "popular" crowd, like that matters. I think what really kicked it off for me was getting pretty bad acne for most of high school. It hurt my self esteem and I don't think I've ever really recovered.

I am seeing a psychiatrist and am on lexapro and klonopin for anxiety. The depression is really just killing my work ethic which mean I'm struggling in school and lately I feel I've been even withdrawing from my friends here in college. I dread being awake and sleep way too much. Here is a little something I wrote while I was feeling really bad that I think outlines how I feel every day.



Suddenly, unexpectedly consciousness returned with a forceful jolt. Whatever he was dreaming, it was long gone to him now, it shattered like a glass dropping from a great height. He could feel a cold sweat encasing his body and threw off the blankets. It all quickly came back to him and, just like every morning, he wished it hadnt. The inanity, the despondence, the overwhelming feeling of dread accompanying each day, he could not imagine life without it. His only solace was that he could feel himself becoming more and more numb to it each morning. Maybe someday he would wake up and it wouldnt bother him anymore, maybe someday this would become normal for him, but today was not that day.

I was just wondering if you could give me any advice on how to get out of this tailspin. The only time I'm happy is when I am seeing a girl and I have been broken up with twice probably due to my depression. I just want to feel motivated and normal again.

No idea why I like it and it disgusts me in real life or if its real but I guess it's the whole domination/power thing. When im having sex with I'll get into dirty talk a bit like "you've been such a naughty girl" etc... Wow that sounds fucking lame typed out but I think the whole exchange is fairly normal. I may be just jaded by porn so someone please let me know if this is odd or I am fucked up freak.

 I agree the fact that he grouped both acid and ecstasy with meth just makes absolutely no sense... I probably thought similarly when I was like 16 but that was 7 years and a few trips ago.

Don't get me wrong they're not healthy for you by any means, ecstasy more so than acid, but they're definitely not meth. 




 Sounds like you really don't know much about drugs at all. Anyone who has any sense would tell you coke is a much worse drug than acid... care to explain your reasoning? 




 I agree about time for me to take off if you know what I mean ;)

 Get better friends 




 Congratulations! I can't really relate, I've been blessed with a really fast metabolism but I'm sure that will slow down as I get older(only 22 now). 

Right now, I can basically eat anything I want, be completely sedentary and not gain any weight whatsoever. Add the fact that unless I'm eating one of the few foods I absolutely love, I see eating more as an inconvenience than anything and you get my 6' 135 lbs self. 

Opposite ends of the spectrum I guess, I can definitely feel the physical effects of being slightly underweight but I still consider myself very lucky.

PS you speak English better than half of the native speakers here.
 









 Well yeah, I wouldn't say it to someone I just met or am just acquaintances with but with my girlfriend or other girls I'm decent friends with I am sure I'm not offending anyone. Maybe it's just my personality but it's very obvious I'm joking as I'm usually a very nice and pleasant person.

Also it's not like I do this all the time or even very often at all. 




 Have you ever posted anything that wasn't a personal attack or racial/sexual slur? Why the fuck would you keep posting with -785 karma? People here seem to despise you.... for good reason too. You have no room to comment on the content of anyone else's posts. 

Keep up the good work

 Are you are jumping to conclusions like that dude from office space. I take responsibility for my actions as you can see in this thread but fuck you 




 Yep this was a huge wake up call for me why are fucking biological urges to reproduce so strong it's not fair 
























 I'm wondering if this type of movement would be applicable to improve all-terrain vehicles, maybe something kind of like that robotic pack mule. Probably not because of the whole volume to surface area ratio thing. Even if it was, I'm sure this would have been at least considered in the engineering process of the robot mule. 




 Well he also started drinking so heavily after Watergate that his staff actually had to take the nuclear codes away from him.

He was a pretty shitty guy in all reality and might have started a nuclear war if he had been able to.

 If I could actually write, I would have had the character turn to run and see another one in that direction. Turn a different direction, same thing.  




 Hahah I'm sorry but I had to edit that. I kind of feel bad because it was almost too perfect of a typo but that's just too embarrassing. 




 I know, right? Imagine walking through somewhere like the woods or a poorly lit park at night and seeing something weird out of the corner of your eye. You look and its one of those things just standing in the distance. After a moment or two it starts slowly walking toward you. As it gets closer you begin to notice there are others surrounding you doing the same thing and there's no where to run, no way to get away.

I wish I could actually write well because I feel like this would be scary as shit, but I'm just a lowly engineer.

Edit: I wish I could put into words the scenario I'm imagining, creative writing is fucking harder than I thought. If someone wants to actually make this into a well written scary story go for it.
 




 I don't remember learning about anyone other than Einstein and Bohr throughout any of my schooling up until college/ 




 Ah, welp looking back on what I wrote he's right. I had to pull an allnighter last night getting ready for a couple exams I've got on Monday so I'm not exactly the most coherent person right now and those study aids make me ramble like a mad man too. 




 This is going to sound really condescending but I don't understand why stuff like this is a big deal and gets so many up votes just because someone is wearing something related to reddit. If I saw something like this I would probably think "oh cool he must really like Reddit" and go on my way.

 Reddit is one of the biggest if not the biggest social media aggregate sites on the internet.
 It's not like it's some like super secret esoteric club, I'm 24 and almost every single one of my friends goes on Reddit at least occasionally. I just feel like sometimes people have this idea that it's a close knit community and you're automatically going to be great friends with someone just because they are a redditor too and I just don't think that's the case. 
But hey, I guess Karma is pretty cool. 




 What are you talking about? I'm talking about the 2chan denko thread, which is what the 2 comments above mine were referencing. If you haven't read it, you should do it, it's possibly the most cringy thing on the internet 




 After reading that, I can't help but feel a little sorry for the denko guy he was just naive, a bit off his rocker and incredibly socially maladjusted(not that that excuses any of his behavior). Her shitty friend on the other hand, was the true villain who knew exactly what she was doing, what a sociopath.  




 Honestly, whenever something like this happens I just type the acronym into google and the meaning of the it pops right up at the top.

 Any idea how big the DC metro area is compared to say, the Atlanta metro area? How long does it take to drive to DC from NOVA?

Also I've always heard DC is the one of the most dangerous cities in the US? Any idea how it compares to say Atlanta? In case you can't tell I live in ATL so I'm just trying to get a reference 




 You're a true hero... Is this all in Austin?

 Here's a video of the paint being added http://vimeo.com/45021408 




 I would think  it's possible that dogs are innately able to recognize some human aspects better than animals because of the thousands of years of selective breeding. It would be interesting to take at look at the difference of response in wild dogs.

The way dogs naturally communicate puts a lot of emphasis on the tone of the barks and other vocalizations so I would think they would have some response. My guess is the wouldn't understand what is trying to be conveyed as well because they don't understand what different tones signify for humans. 




 No... pitch has nothing to do with volume, it is how deep or high pitched your voice is. It's kind of hard to define tone now that I think about it, I guess it's the way you say things so I guess tone depends on your cadence. 




 I like HotWheelz personally 




 Yes but .001 is not equal to .001%. .001 is equivalent to .1%. If you were trying to get 1% of something you would multiply that something by .01. 5% you multiply by .05. 90% you multiply by .9.

I know how to do basic math maybe you should take a second to actually read what I'm saying 




 That's .1%! To get 1% of something you multiply by .01 not 1 




 This is wrong... just because a pattern is random and non-repeating doesn't mean it contains everything...  




 Actually .001% of 7 billion is 70000 




 What are you talking about 




 I was just talking about this particular reference to Gloria 




 It's from the show Modern Family 




 I had a friend in college who completely went off the deep end. Gradually over the course of a couple weeks he got farther and farther removed from reality. He bought his close friends all kind of gifts that there was no way he could afford, completely destroyed his apartment, writing all over the walls and trashing it, and was convinced people we after him. He even thought at one point he had created a light saber and the FBI had broken into his house and stole it. He moved out of his apartment and began living on a volleyball court behind our fraternity house(he was a brother too) in a tent. This all climaxed when he took off all his clothes and started walking around the house naked with a knife in his hands. Scary stuff, the mind is a delicate thing. 




 Some people equate legality with safety. They think oh if it's legal it must be safer than actual weed when the reality is very much the opposite.

 My direction in life is not too bad. I'm taking a semester off now but will graduate in the fall with a masters in biomedical engineering. I have severe anxiety and have don't really have any friends back home which is where I am now. I'm a bit social inept and a lot of times I have trouble holding conversions especially which people I don't know. It's hard to find hobbies because everything I once enjoyed doesnt seem interesting due to the depression. I am trying to work my way out of this, have been on anti depressant for 5 years but the only thing that makes me actually be able to enjoy life is opiates and obviously thats not an option.

Something is just wrong with my brain chemistry I think. Even back in the when my first hook up was with the girl who ended up prom queen I still thought about suicide alll the time 




 After being incredibly depressed over half my 23 year old life, it makes me jealous as fuck 




 I'm the same way. I couldn't stand to think how my family would react. I don't want to die so much as just never have existed in the first place. I guess being chronically depressed for over half my life will do that to you

 Yeah that's actually what I meant to include as a counter to his point but I just now realized what I posted actually seems like evidence of his point, time to edit 




  A "prisoner" begged to leave and Zimbardo allegedly "encouraged" him to stay to the extent that the prisoner returned to the other prisoners, telling them that, "we aren't allowed to leave". There were also other instances where people were kept against their will and not because of social embarrassment.

From http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1pt80c/psychological_experiments_gone_horribly_wrong/cd5w6k7

It seems he "encouraged" participants to stay but did not say you're allowed to leave. According to a reply to this post a couple student actually did leave the study.
 




 I was born in Poughkeepsie. Glad to know my hometown is keeping up the good work 




 I remember seeing this book sitting on the coffee table at home and seeing the cover. A little bit of me died that day, life was never the same and it definitely didn't help my fear of the dark, although I was more scared of being abducted by aliens than anything else.

I was a strange child. That alien phobia never quite went completely away and I've told friends about it recently. If they ever play a practical joke on me involving aliens I honestly would freak the fuck out. Especially if it was anything like this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hl8lnZjMcos

Life is cute, but you are cuter. 

Mount my pecker, purple daughter

I'm pretty good at skill shots and most times I'll just throw them where I think the enemy will be. I'm sure a lot of variables contribute to where I place them but aiming the shot happens so fast I could never really explain my thought process, only that I felt the player would move there so I aimed there. I wonder if it's the same type of deal.

 I go to school at Georgia Tech, but I'm from Texas and honestly Atlanta is still worse in terms of racism. I think it has something to do with the large black population of the city, especially in the areas around campus which are significantly worse off. I think it has a lot more to do with socioeconomic status than race but around here black and poor really do seem to go hand in hand and this stereotype is often re-enforced. 




 Looks like its going down down in an earlier round

 Yeah considering drug legalization doesnt effect addiction rates [^1](http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/europe/120718/drug-decriminalization-portugal-addicts), it is much better for people to get unregulated black market drugs than regulated, pure drugs which they would be using anyways.  




 For me a bad trip on acid(never had a bad one on shrooms) is kind of like taking the anxiety and uncomfortable feeling I get when I'm too high or in the wrong environment and multiplying it by 10. I've tripped probably at least 40 times, the last time over a year ago. That was such a bad trip I had to leave my friends because I was paranoid and was at the point where my mind was racing too fast to even be able to form coherent sentences. By the time I wanted to say something, my mind was already somewhere else so anything I said would have be incoherent babble.

I've also convinced myself I was crazy a couple times and that this time I had taken it too far, taken too much acid and I was never gonna come back down. Those trips sucked a lot but a good trip on acid is equally as mind blowing, in an opposite, amazing way.

TLDR: Acid is a hell of a drug  




 Admittedly, I do not know much about linguistics but languages fascinate me. Years ago, when I was in high school I remember browsing the wordreference forums where a similar question was asked and there were some languages with properties that astounded me.

I can't contribute, studying languages unfortunately took a back seat to engineering for me after high school but I figured this would be the best place to ask. 

I may xPost to askReddit if this gets enough interest.

Just have to point that out considering you did it five times 




 Here ya go 
 Because the liberal left has convinced everyone that McCarthy was as bad as Hitler. The dude was pretty much right, and the rise of state-owned assets and banking which is a component of socialist thinking is what led to the crisis we're in right now. Most Americans, and redditors for that matter, can't accept that voting people in to spend other people's money regardless of whether or not they deserve that money could lead to a shortage of that money and a resistance to hiring to spend that money.

 I was at Bonnaroo one year when he was headlining the last day(think it was 2011?) which means he was the only show at the time at a festival of 100,000+ people. So, a fucking huge crowd to say the least and one of my favorites shows I've ever seen but what really stood out to me was there was a girl in the very front row with a shirt that said "It's my birthday today!!!". He proceeded to call he up on stage in between songs and get the entire crowd(at least 80,000 people) to sing her happy birthday. He has always seemed like the most down to earth celebrity and that just cemented it for me. 




 If you get this up in arms about bow hunting you need a reality check... Nature is fucked up, humans are fucked up and neither you or anyone else are ever gonna change that. Hope self perceived moral superiority makes you happy 




 I understand the dislike of people killing for fun with guns but for food with bows and arrows? Like people did for hundreds of thousands of years? The kind of killing that is constantly happening in nature? Granted it's with simple tools, but that's kinda our equivalent to a bear's claws and strength.

 My fraternity house is literally a minute walk away from the stadium for Georgia Tech in Atlanta and a ton of people would drive by it to park on gameday. We would stand out in the road(not blocking traffic obviously) with a beer and a sign saying you honk we drink and basically every car that went by would honk. Whenever cops would roll by all the time and do their little *woop woop* siren and we would finish the can. It was awesome.

 Pulling the old Sir John A. Macdonald, only Canadian Prime Minister to win six majority governments.

  One famous story is that during an election debate Macdonald was so drunk he began vomiting violently on stage while his opponent was speaking. Picking himself up Macdonald told the crowd, "see how my opponent's ideas disgust me."

In another version of the story, he responded to his opponent's query of his drunkenness with "It goes to show that I would rather have a drunk Conservative than a sober Liberal.". 




 You're correct, thank you. I believe everyone should unequivocally be treated with respect unless they do something making them lose it. I am just curious but you're right there really is no way to explain the whole gender spectrum, it just is. 




 Go the fuck away 




 I've never understood the term gender fluid. I 100% believe that due to brain chemistry, hormones, etc. some people who were born one sex feel like the other. I'm not saying I don't believe that people are actually gender fluid and feel like different sexes at different times, I just don't understand at all what would cause this. 




 I want the world to know 




 Not even just his stuff haha... OP got my car stolen by leaving my keys in my unlocked car. 




 Remeber that time you got my car stolen? None of this surprises me at all 




 I'm pretty sure what he was thinking about, something to do with a copious amount of drugs. 

This is the same kid that got my car stolen by leaving my keys in my unlocked car outside a party in a sketchy area. Luckily I found my car at 7AM next morning parked just around the corner from where I had parked it. The keys were sitting **on my hood** in plain view so I guess someone had a fun joyride in it. Somehow he always gets super luckily with the dumb shit he does. 




 I'm just guessing here but I bet the reasoning is to try to prove they're an "alpha" male not a push-over pussy "beta". Combine that with the severe social ineptitude that these people are bound to have and you get this creepy, disturbing shit. 




 I ashamed to even be able to answer this but its called "negging" and it is the dumbest thing ever, especially for the type of severely socially inept people that the PUA "technique" appeals to. 




 Don't forget about /r/AnimalPorn ,  all the badass animals of the world together in a sub!

 No he sensationalized it pretty heavily. I can't see anything constructive about adding 2 base pairs to DNA, when life seems to do fine with just 4. Maybe it will give us more choices with amino acids, etc. but considering we can't even really design our own proteins now due to post-translation modifications and not understanding folding and a whole number of other issues.

This is pretty cool I guess but nothing super ground breaking and I believe it implies that we are close to things like designing our own proteins that nature could never design when in actuality we are pretty far away. It also really doesn't seem like this author understands the whole transcription and translation process and how this applies to building proteins

BTW fuck you ryan 




 Rob Ford for President 2016. fuck the constitution we need him here in the states 




 So we should just disregard 90% of the community because of your opinion? 




 But it does bring a group of similar minded people together. I am subscribed to /r/drugs but I never really post there. I will admit sometimes the posts get me cravings to do those drugs but it has not increased my overall drug use at all and is a very knowledgeable and for the most part level-headed community. 




 I always thought brilliant writers hold most of the cards compared to publishers, especially if they're as established as Fitzgerald(I'm not sure if he was at the time though I guess). I would think he could put whatever he wants in his book but I guess that's not true.  




 Oh wow yeah! Ba$h was the shit. I remember i would go to his arena(?go bash) and fuck around with him because you had like unlimited repels and thor's and boosts and all the values for the ships were messed around with. It was a lot of fun 




 For some reason the only name I can remember from back then is Callidus. NO idea why that stuck with me. 




 So I guess I got butthole gainz wasted last night haha? Don't really remember writing any of this 




 I can't remember.. can't even remember what squad I was in but it wasn't like a top tier one, maybe second tier squad. 

I played dep all the time and could break some ankles as scout too. This is annoying me that I can't think of what my name was but I'm sure it was really dumb, I was 12. 




 So it's a 2d game where you control various types of ships using only the key board. Tab is shoot rockets, ctrl is bullets. It's basically like that old school asteroids game where you except multiplayer with 8 different types of ships, objectives(CTF, king of the hill, etc.) and ton of different weapons. The objectives on the maps are super fun, the game has a great community and it's really easy to pick up but hard to master. It's definitely worth the 5 minutes it takes to install it and try it out.


 




 Come play. It literally takes 5 mins to dl and install and I'm getting a nostalgia overload. It would also be nice to have a few more people playing. 




 Fuck that hell no. Moistening is the most female thing I could possibly think of, you gotta do it bareback and dry as the Sahara

You could probablu try to email someone from that thread and ask.

 The trick is to start shitting a couple times a day for a couple of days. This should be more than you usually do and you may need supplements to reach your shit quota. This is rip your butthole to shread. Now comes the hard part. For the next 2 weeks you are allowed one shit a week. This allows the tissue to heal. After these 3 weeks you will notice some sick gains in your butthole strength. Feel free to post pictures of your technique and I'll take a look at em ;)

 I changed it! sorry about that it was the first one that popped up on google and it seemed legit. 




 I'm not sure but I changed it to a different website that has brrn updated more recently just in case 




 Probably around 02-04. I cant remember my name for the life of me or what guild or whatever it was called i was in. I used to be really good at dep and scout 




 Yep I'm currently on trench wars getting absolutely massacred  




 I don't remember what my username was but I do remember callidus was fucking amazing and I would always dep for her. Miss playing soldier too, and the #2 scout damn good days 




 Sounds like that might have been Trench Wars. People still play, there's usually 60-100 people on and peak times.

Edit: actualy 158 on right now on that server 




 That's the only server I played for the two years I really played continuum and I just liked it a lot better than Trench Wars or Extreme Game. Maybe I don't know the nuances of those servers well enough but I long to play some metal gear. Does anyone else feel similar? 




 I know it's awesome. I should have described it more when i made the post but I was too lazy. What servers did you play on? I played Metal Gear CTF 




 What server? I played metal gear CTF and its so much different I still haven't quite figured out trench wars and that other big server, extreme games maybe? 




 I have a script for xanax... after all the opiates I've done, benzo's dont really give me much euphoria, a little, but not a lot. 




 Is it bad that that movie made me want to swindle and manipulate the shit out of people and fuck them over completely in the process so I could get that kind of life and do that many drugs and fuck so many dimes. 




 Dude it was all about metal gear. I loved that server. It's not up anymore though =( 




 Oh.. I guess I'm more of a TagAmateur than a Tag pro. I'm only like 15 degrees 




 And be sure to inject butter directly into your blood stream every 4 hours to alleviate the debilitating emotional pain 




 Do you think you're better than me? You're a pussy with your pristine asshole than isn't so covered with scar tissue that you can poop in under 2 hours. I laugh at you before you laugh at me 




 I would periodically move things around their desk around while they are focused on something else. Maybe move a notebook from a drawer onto the desk. Maybe move a pen they just had in their hand onto the other side of the desk. Things that would be physically impossible to happen. This would be very subtle, maybe once or twice a month at most. Gradually I'd start doing more obvious things, like unplugging their monitor or making a stapler fall off their desk for no reason. 

Maybe after 6 months of this, I would start writing messages to them, either using a pen and one of their notbooks that is out of sight, or distracting them enough to write something like **LEAVE THIS PLACE** OR **WAKE UP** on their computer. Maybe I would do this with notes or if they are working on something in word, just type it in the middle of their document. Eventually they would begin to doubt their sanity. As they neared the breaking point, if I sensed they we're going ot loose it soon, I would draw dickbutt in paint and tile it as their background. I would then write "turn around" and have a couple hundred thousands dollars in my hand(which I had stolen using telekinesis) and give it to them to maybe make up for the torture. 




 Do you want me to sit in a corner and rust or just fall apart where I'm standing?  




 I'm currently toughing my asshole up. I started with singly ply and then I found half ply, next the finest grain sand paper available. I gradually increased the grain fineness over the course of the past two years and now I use steel wool and I feel manly as fuck. 

It's like that ass pennies sketch. If i ever am uncomfortable around someone I just think their candy ass can't wipe with steel wool, they don't deserve to be in my presence.
 




 Well I(along with many many other people I assume) am a completely different person on the internet than I am in real life. I would never even think about saying anything like that to anyone I know. It's kind of like how you change how you act, even if only a little, depending on the people you're around 




 COuld I be your unlikely morbid, depressed and callous robot penguin sidekick. 




 Or you could just spend a dollar or 2 extra to avoid the butthole pillaging altogether.  




 For each their own... anonymity breeds weirdness 




 [Continuum](http://www.subspace.co/). Archaic game the is incredibly addicting and fun

Edit: Wish I had put more effort into this post, I feel like it could be much higher up 




 I seriously think they should make a tagpro type game with a 3d engine. Maybe something a little like LoL, you would have skills(like jukes or spins or sprint) which would be on a cool down. Maybe even different classes(scout, defender, etc.) too but you would move with WASD.

Edit: Just to clarify how I'm picturing it: It would still be CTF. The only way to die would still be running into each other, or maybe some type of special move. Maybe there would be some projectile type attacks you could aim with the arrow keys, but of coursee they would have cooldowns.

Can anyone elaborate on why this would be a bad idea. I don't care of downvotes I'm just curious
  




 To be honestly I was just trying to type the weirdest possible thing I could ala /u/mroglolblo or /u/_vargas_. Just wanted to try it out, had never done it before

If you want to read some stories kinda like that except a millions times better go through mrog's history

Here's a preview
I wouldn't want to have sex with the queen but it could be kind of hot if she watched. She has always seemed like she has a "wry" sense of humor and has always struck me as a woman of intense curiosity. How cool would it be to bring a chick back to your place and she sees the queen sitting in a chair in the corner as you frantically undress each other and she stops and says "oh gosh, it's you!" "It is an honor your majesty!" and she awkwardly curtsies while covering her tits with one hand, "charmed my dear, now start fucking!" At first she is really demure and tries to be as tender and "proper" as possible, missionary only etc. and the queen starts shrieking "none of that, when I said start fucking, I meant start FUCKING!!!" and maintains steely eye contact with her 




 So OP's picture is literally the first one to come up for chinese english tattoo on google image. [Here's the second](http://i.imgur.com/hRGQoJh.jpg) 




 Plot Twist: His boss is a transvestite and he caught her right after she had finished jackin it. 




 I mean what I wrote is just as plausible as the OP's story honestly. 




 Only thing left to do is post this picture of an intimate situation between two people publicly for literally everyone I even kind of know can see it. 




 That's when you say oh here let me wipe that off for you and pull out your rock hard dick and ever so tenderly get every drop on the tip of your dick. 

The moment is finally here! That skill you've been practicing for months, that you've put your life and soul in, it's moment has arrived. You lie down and prepare. Pushing your dick down as far as it will go you steady yourself. Using the cock pushup acquired dick strength, you let her rip. The the cum is shot in a perfect arc right into your own open mouth. A flawless dick catapult. The man juice in your mouth tastes better than ever before, you literally have an orgasm in your mouth.

 Don't forget to run it under some warm Code Red first. 




 Wish the same thing could have been said about his pituitary gland :(. He was such an amazing person 




 Aw. Guess just exorbitant amounts of coke will have to fill the void. 




 I don't know if I could handle those Zefs there though(unless they look like Yolandi). Are they like the SA version of chavs? 




 The name roach is very fitting for them 




 Does this imply most of his novels underwent similar censorship? 




 You forgot the type a horrible comment step somewhere before exit out. 




 Watching that movie makes me want to do so many drugs. Does anyone know if ludes were actually as awesome as they make them out to be? 




 For snorting coke, I'd say the norm is 20-40 mins between lines depending on how much you have 




 Can you provide proof for any of this? The majority of other posts in this thread seem to say the exact opposite. 




 I envy you as well. I've got a 5 hours left till my engineering degree and my recent lack of a social life has kind of left me unmotivated to put my all into school. I am on medication of depression and anxiety but I feel some kind of therapy would help but so far the 2 therapists I've seen haven't really helped. 




 For some reason I read that as conversation... I'm a pretty quite guy and sometimes have trouble holding conversations with 
people I don't know well and was just seeing if maybe that type of therapy would help me but I guess some other type of therapy would be much better
 




 7What about the amazonian(I think) fish thing that swims up your urethra when you pee and lodges itself in there.  




 Can I ask what you symptoms you were treated for. 




 It seems to be it's just a bit more specific than his earlier claim and meant to clarify. 




 Of course inflation has a bit to do with it as well. 




 Who cares? Your'e a fucking dick 




 I know right. I speak a little German so I understood maybe like half of it but it was like a really weird mix of german and english 




 Don't forget about your duderuses either. 




 Do you mean alprazolam? Altrazaplan isn't anything
 




 Yep, I remember reading in biochem that the best internal combustion engine is only around 30-40% efficient in harnessing the energy produced by breaking C-H bonds, while our bodies are 60-70% efficient. 




 What? That's crazy I live in Texas and it's only around $3.30-$3.50 




 I found [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/23dyes/recap_the_failed_moderation_and_gaming_of/cgyf5y4) a little while ago... Take it with a grain of salt obviously
 




 Ah I see, didn't catch that 




 I've tripped more times than I can count and I was want to say you have a really good idea of what it's like for someone who hasn't done it. I would definitely recommend trying it at least once, but only in the right environment. It's really just gives you a whole new perspective on things and is quite interesting. 




 It's still on? I thought it got canceled cause I've only seen a few episodes. 




 Thank you that's really interesting and I would never notice anything like that. I also appreciate you being so civil cause I honestly don't understand why this question got so much hate. 




 I never said she looked better with no make up on.. I meant this style of make up. Maybe I didn't word it quite right but this is just ridiculous. I asked a legitimate question I was curious about Sorry for trying to expand my horizons a bit 




 Haha I'm suprised anyone understood that at all... so many typos damn swype 




 I think we're not on the same page. I was talking more about the neuroscience part like /u/mroxiful  




 Yes 3 legs on the ground at all times makes walking very simple but what about for walking over things? What about getting away from predators? Etc. Is it the most efficient for all these factors which highly influence the life and death of the insect and in turn the strength of the colony.
 




 Same. I'm done wasting my time arguing about it, what a waste of 45 minutes. 




 Thanks, I didn't know about the earlier models but it makes perfect sense. 




 I guess /r/science spoils me in this regard 




 Maybe it is that simple, but I'm sure there are other factors at play. Yes 3 legs on the ground at all times is great but what about for walking over things? What about getting away from predators? Etc. Is it the most efficient for all these factors which highly influence the life and death of the insect and in turn the strength of the colony. 

It obviously is because insects have 6 legs but what I'm trying to say it's not just basic geometry by any means. 

Source: Many classes from my biomedical engineering degree and a little bit of critical thinking 




 Maybe it is that simple, but I'm sure there are other factors at play. Yes 3 legs on the ground at all times is great but what about for walking over things? What about getting away from predators? Etc. Is it the most efficient for all these factors?  




 Exactly! Many cases.. not all. 




 Maybe he did and couldn't find anything so he decided to ask the person who was making the claim. I'm willing to bet that's the case actually.

Any critical thinking, scientifically literate person would do the same thing. 




 I think you are probably right but just because it seems to make sense doesn't mean it's necessarily true, and if it is true it shouldn't be too hard to do a google or google scholar search to provide a source and remove all doubt 




 I can and I'm sure he can too, but just because it seems to make sense doesn't mean it's true by any means.  




 It makes me sad that some people so blindly believe things that they would condescendingly question why you don't. 




 Do you have any idea what that robotic pack mule was 4 legged and modeled after mammals, than after something like this. Maybe the who size difference and surface area to volume ratio thing? 
























 Either that or the admins are stepping in... 




 I agree that would be great but I feel police today have a vested interested in keeping their current focus. I don't know if changing their focus would be possible without a lot of resistance from current police departments. 




 But changing what we call officers would have no effect at all on their actions and priorities. 




 I'm guessing this was somewhere in Williamson county? 




 Or add some salt 




 Yeah I guess I didn't make it clear but I actually have watched all of season 2-7 and for the most part it was fucking great. Just finished "All good things..." like 2 days ago which was a fairly fitting end for the TV show. 




 Out of curiosity I started watching TNG at the end of season 1 right before Riker got his beard because I caught a couple episodes on BBC: America before deciding to watch the whole thing and just wanted to continue from where I'd been watching. How good is the first season? After finishing season 7 it's going to be hard to go back to the beginning and I always have qualms about the first season of shows I think because of the Simpsons season 1. 




 One of the reasons for this has been the fact that we have over the years seen an excess of young players from continents like Africa or South America, who have been sent over or brought over by clubs to take trials that haven't worked out for them. And the players just don't have the money to be able to go back to their countries.

From [this article](http://www.npr.org/2014/04/06/299708689/after-scandal-barcelona-football-club-banned-from-trades) I found when I was trying to figure out what was going on 




 "The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist."

Fuck I love Kevin Spacey too much not to include a House of Cards quote too. 

Ive always loathed the necessity of sleep. Like death, it puts even the most powerful men on their backs. 




 I would think that the less serious cases of ebola are also less likely to get hospitalized or  to report it, making the morality rate skewed higher than it actually is. Just a guess though. 




 I feel in a post-technological collapse world, unless it was caused by something which would damage electronics, microprocessors and the like would become somewhat of a mine-able or forage-able resource for a time. There would people left to with enough knowledge to build new computers from scavenged parts or maintain old computers which still function. Granted this would might only happen once basic needs such as food and survival are taken care of, but perhaps not. Computers may be a big enough boon to planning how to rebuild infrastructure, beginning from the basics of providing water and food to an area of people, that they would remain useful as long as the power needed for them could be provided, 




 Do you hear your own voice super imposed over what you are actually hearing? No the two are distinctly separate for me. I imagine it would be the same visually. I can imagine an image without it impeding my ability to see why would this be any different? 




 I'm scared hold me 




 I don't know personally I've had especially coherent insightful thoughts while tripping. One of the many things I realized from the many times I have tripped is that words are constraining. 

There weren't words for many of the sensations I felt, there was no way to describe my altered perceptions to anyone else who had never experienced it. It made me realize how truly confined  I am to my own body and words which were created, if you will, by someone who is not me. 

Stephen Colbert once said, in an interview out of character, that every person had two names. One that describes him as other people perceive him, and one totally ineffable to anyone but himself that describes who he truly is. I think that principle also applies to a persons thoughts and feelings and it takes an especially eloquent person to transcend these barriers. It made me wonder if I will ever be able to know anyone else as they truly are. 




 Just to let you know next time you need to press enter twice when you want to start new line, not once.

 You are truly a great person and I wish him all the best. This has made something I or anyone I know have never experienced much more real to me.  As a recently graduated Biomedical Engineer I really hope I can contribute to improving cancer treatments at some point in my career because cancer is fucking fucked. I can't even find the words to describe my feelings towards it.  




 Haha how embarrassing 




 Haha oops I didn't watch it because I had already seen it. Thought they were different interviews 




 She said in an other interview that she tried teamspeak/vent/whatever and people recognized her voice...

Edit: I'm a dumbass and didn't watch this video before commenting because I had seen  itbefore.  




 Maybe it's just me but some unnecessary euphemisms, especially that try to downplay a particularly serious situation don't sit right with me. For example that some employees will be "more impacted" due to "company restructuring", instead of just calling it what it is, necessary company layoffs because the company has been under performing. 

This situation already sucks, no one ever wants to have to get rid of employees or be laid-off themselves but when this does happen, everyone knows what's going on. These euphemisms don't help the situation at all, you can do something like this in a respectful manner without treating adults like children who can't handle the reality of what's happening..  




 After 2 drinks a lot, if not most, men at least will have a BAC below .08. 




 What is up with this ref. The majority of the calls he has made have been wrong and have also had a game changing effect. 




 I figure incineration is pretty good at getting rid of pathogens too so I was just wondering what the point of doing both is. It seems a little redundant. Maybe it's autoclaved prior to transportation to an incinerator or something? 




 Out of curiosity what is the point of autoclaving it before incineration? Just to ensure that no pathogens are spread prior to destroying it? 




 That's really interesting, it'd be awesome if it was actually him. I wouldn't be surprised.  




 No but I also don't believe *every single* post that mentions a company in any way is definitely posted by that company as a means of cheap advertising. I'm sure it happens but I don't jump to that conclusion without evidence. Throw in the fact that OP's account is over a year old, has a decent amount of karma and does not mention this company any other time and I feel that it is a reasonable doubt. 




 Did you ask him about the details? Why did he do it? Where did he end up landing after parachuting out of the plane? How did he get from there to a town and eventually to Mexico? What did he do with all the money, why did very little of it enter circulation etc.? 




 That's really interesting. Was his story convincing enough that you actually believe it?  




 Story? 




 It will definitely be a good game. I'm hoping di Maria will be able to play, Argentina looked a little lackluster today without him. 




 I wouldn't be surprised if Neuer saves all 5 if it comes down to penalties but I would be surprised if it even comes to penalties. That's not Germany's style 




 I agree. It was the polar opposite of last game 




 Yep, penalties are kind of lame... 




 The ESPN stream can't take the pressure. Gah stop buffering! 




 I guarantee he's studied the shit out of Argentinian players and how they take penalties. I bet keeping him in was planned and he's gotten helped preparing by Krul too 




 I agree but a game like this game could easily go on for a very long time. I don't know if that's the right thing to do either. 




 Childrens hospital was filmed at the hospital afterwards but since that show changed locations in the last couple seasons it makes sense that the hospital is gone n ow 




 Yeah I agree getting hit with a shot is much much worse, goalies are a crazy, tough breed. 




 Yeah you're right, I guess it was just during practices now that I think about it. It was 6 years ago so everything is kind of blurred together at this point. It did make practicing in the 100 degree Texas heat a bit more bearable. 




 As a former college attack, it also kind of sucks to get beat on by 6' poles. 




 Definitely did they same thing playing attack except I didn't wear elbow pads at all. Getting beaten on with 6' titanium poles is a bit less intense than what goalies had to go through though. 




 They definitely do, he must have been just fucking around and not in an actual game or something. 




 Yep my highschool in Texas had enough people for 3 separate teams, JV, D2 varsity and varsity. Really fun sport I miss it a lot, especially playing attack and not have to run constantly all game. 

I don't really miss getting beaten on with 6' titanium sticks all the time though. I never wore elbow pads either and took the actual shoulder pads off my shoulder pads so they was just chest pads too. Probably wasn't the smartest thing to do. 




 I'm reading Shogun right now, actually left the last 20 pages for this evening. I've been wondering how historically accurate it is...Are you saying it's not very accurate? If you've read it

Edit: in the book the samurai, especially the lower tier ones, seem to take bushido pretty seriously but have no qualms about disregarding it when it is useful to them.  




  they weren't bound by some code of honor or anything like that

Uhh isn't that exactly what bushido is? 




 Except that's not how it works. As far as I know, the reddit fuzzing algorithm basically took the actual number of upvotes and varied it by a certain percentage. This percentage increased with the total number of votes. They then took varied the number of downvotes in the same manner so the comment's total karma was relatively close the to the actual comment score. 




 Go for it man. Maybe if you look back on these post in 5 years when you're 18 you'll realize how much of a douchebag you are but have fun until then. 




 Next time be cordial when trying to make your point. It may have been valid but berating people like that is going to nothing but make you look like a huge fucking douchebag 




 You're a braver man(woman?) than I. I didn't dare to venture into the putrid cesspool that is surely his comment history. The strange thing is he is not a negative karma troll just a angry man. I would imagine he is very socially inept if he figured that would be an effective way to make his point. 




 I didn't believe it either but a doing a quick google produced   [this](http://articles.latimes.com/2014/jan/27/world/la-fg-north-korea-meth-20140127). 




 I know right! All I did is say what everyone else is thinking, I don't think I deserve gold for it, but hey I'll take it! 




 Hey, asshole

OP is doing some genuine good in the world. Maybe the charity he chose to donate to isn't the best possible choice but that is no reason to insult him. 

Your further promotion of this radical organization will not be tolerated.

Tolerated by who? You think arrogantly think you're speaking on behalf of all of reddit. You think OP is actively promoting this organization out of malevolence and not because he is trying to help?  Fuck off 




 Germany didn't play their best but I feel Germany was by no means lethargic 




 Let's hope Mueller is ok! 




 What a great game! 




 No it's in our interest to Germany to win i believe. 




 Give that corner to Klose! 




 For once Klose off key and off target =( 




 One of the best matches so far! Since so many good games in this WC! 




 No they can't! 




 Neuer... best goalkeept in the world! 




 Oezil! Too good of a passer 




 I'm just glad it wasn't against the US 




 Me too! Germany has always been my favorite team because the US normally isn't very good. I'm so conflicted! 




 Schweinstieger scores in the 87' to win it for Germany. 




 Ahh so out of character for Lahm why that back heal? 




 If you mean a devastatingly effiecent, wurst eating, beer drinking badass then I agree 




 You guys are good! Definitely a world class team, 




 I've got a raging efficient German boner too! 




 This world cup is fucking awesome. 




 If Ghana wins 3 teams have 3 points. It means we have to beat Portugal to have a advance. Otherwise if Germany wins we are in I believe 




 By scoring a goal! That's how 




 That frontflip! 




 Klose! 




 It seems like they have potential to go far in this tournament 




 Get your shit together Germany. Deutschland ueber alles(ausser USA) 




 Most upsets in the world cup group stage ever? I'm not losing hope, Deutschland ueber alles(ausser USA)! 




 I know right. Wtf! 




 Hope he's in good enough form! 




 Warum spielt Schweinsteigter heute nicht? Ist er zu alt geworden? Bitte antworte mir auf English mein Deutsch ist Scheisse ich habe Deutsch nut seit zwei jahren studiert(If you can't tell already lol) 




 I swear that just looks like a blink not a wink. Am I seeing things?

Edit: One more question for an ignorant American, why is Schweinsteiger not in? Is he out of form? He's my favorite player 




 Yeah and my retarded post was definitely 100% serious  




 As much as I hate this reddit cliche very relevant username. Mr. Broken leg's is too, the seven at the end obiously refers to his age 




 Unfortunately that makes a lot of sense. Thanks, hope I helped you feel a bit more productive today. Good luck on the BAR! A shot in the dark but I'm guessing from your username you're at VT law or did undergrad there? 




 I'm not sure if you would know this but would her sentence in the US would have been much harsher? Let's say she was charged with battery, reckless endangerment, hit and run and hopefully a couple other charges the prosecution could have added on(criminal negligence?) 




 I found some stuff I've already posted multiple times but /u/TheMSensation is the better internet detective as you can see above 




 Not even close! She should have gotten attempted vehicular manslaughter but I'm pretty sure that's not a real crime. Maybe assault with a deadly weapon? 




 Apparently the video poster commented "she got away lightly with a 2 year suspended, 200 hours community service, 2 year ban and had to pay the victim 500 compensation". 




 The man suffered a broken leg and  she got away lightly with a 2 year suspended, 200 hours community service, 2 year ban and had to pay the victim 500 compensation according to the video poster 




 Haha you beat me finding it by 1 minute! I found the video OP's comment "she got away lightly with a 2 year suspended, 200 hours community service, 2 year ban and had to pay the victim 500 compensation"  




 So the original video poster ended up saying this "she got away lightly with a 2 year suspended, 200 hours community service, 2 year ban and had to pay the victim 500 compensation"  




 Not only that she deserves to lose her freedom for a couple years at least. Hope she got charged with attempted vehicular manslaughter or something like that. 




 To my American ears that sounded pretty tame but I'm sure its not. Would that be the British equivalent to fuck your work you fucking piece of shit?   




 I really want to figure out what happened to that piece of shit. I hope someone finds a follow up article or something that states her punishment 




 That was definitely my favorite post I read that entire day. You brightened my and I'm sure any others day, rolled with the punches so people were laughing with you not at you and I guarantee everyone in your workplace knows you now. This could have happened to anyone. People know that and this will open up more doors than it closes.  




 Are you by chance related to DICK PLACE? 




 You are a dick. 




 First 32 seconds and last 10 minutes! I'll take it 




 It was really good! Definitely better than a lot of TV shows on the air today. I could see this being a sketch on WKUK or something along those lines 




 Here's a big more context for anyone who hasn't had a chance to google the first quote yet.

UN Chief Weapons Inspector Hans Blix, revealed in an interview in 2003 that Vice-President Dick Cheney said to him we will not hesitate to discredit you in favour of disarmament. In other words, tell us there are WMDs or we will claim youre incompetent and go to war anyway. 




 That's exactly how I feel about fringe. 




 They could probably even use my high school stadium! 




 Honestly I had to try pretty hard to come up with someway to disagree with you but I felt it was necessary 




 I feel like the meme format detracts from the seriousness of the situation a bit though. Maybe its just how I view memes but this post would have hit front page regardless of how it was posted and a news story would have given more context. I came into the comments to figure out who this group of people is and some more insight into what exactly this petition is for. I haven't really found anything except shitty jokes and this loser I went to high school with but I guess that's reddit for you. 

Fuck you ryan 




 Tiger got to hunt, bird got to fly;

Man got to sit and wonder 'why, why, why?'

 My high school offered basically all AP classes and I took everyone I could except for US and World history. I also got credit for every test I took and even passed an addition AP test for a class I never took. I ended up coming into college with 28 hours although I think some of my AP credits didn't count toward my major and weren't part of that 28. I was just shy of the 32 hours required to be considered a sophomore 



Also, a lot of colleges limit the amount of hours you can come in with out of high school. I didn't know you can come out of high school with an AA/AS degree but what I did was tough enough. Be careful not to push them too hard. 




 True I worded that wrong, should have said some scientists. I personally believe that we have no idea the full extent of the chain effects eliminating mosquitoes would cause or whether the good would outweigh the bad. I just wanted to point out a different perspective. 




 Mosquitoes may be one of the few organisms that we can live without, and many scientists believe that their elimination would cause no ecological harm.

 This is a very good point, the US is 38th in the world I believe in terms of healthcare. We have a disorganized networks of semi-private organizations motivated by profit. The #2 post on this subreddit right now states 85% of 1900 nurses surveyed across the nation have still not been given any briefing whatsoever on how to handle a case. 




 I think it's a combination of misinformation or omission of relevant details from credible sources and the fickle nature or short attention spans of people preventing them from caring enough to actually follow an outbreak on this timescale. Ebola moves slow enough to not capture the public imagination for very long. 




 Yes exactly. I think the public should be made aware of these facts and a change in protocols and red tape should be instituted. The government needs to be much more proactive with this whole situation and it seems than without prolific scientific and public criticism they are complacent. Based on what this looks like in a couple months, it may be necessary to begin building Ebola designated hospitals in major urban areas to ensure a higher level of scalability across the nation. The US government should use its political weight to encourage international cooperation to provide similar things in poor regions with a very high population density such as the slums of India and South America. An outbreak here poses much greater threats than West Africa. 




 Yes this is my exact point. 




 Actually the studies on Ebola were minimal until this current outbreak. Not many labs have the abilities to test on BSL4 level pathogens and there was little reason to do this as there was a belief that ebola would burn itself out before killing more than 20-100 people because that had happened multiple times already. 

I directly work with someone who is at the CDC 4 days a week working on Ebola. I know what they know and I know how smart they are. They are still people though they are not on a whole other planet they are on earth, literally and figuratively. I am up to date on the vast majority of published scientific studies on the matter and believe me there is a lto of debate in the scientific community over certain specifics. I'm sure the CDC has some material which is not publically published in scientific journals but they aren't that far ahead. it is in their interests to keep the rest of the community up to date. Like I said, I said the more you learn the more you learn what you don't know.  




 You are right, my thought process was that redditors opinions may be based somewhat on government and CDC scientist's statements. I know for a fact experts in ebola, especially those with ties to the CDC who don't want to alienate themselves, that are going to publicly comment on the matter have discussed what they should and should not say. They are downplaying or omitting facts and I believe this had an effect on proactive precautionary measures being taken in hospitals, most notable in Dallas Presbyterian. Does that make sense? Maybe it is a bit of a stretch but that was my thought process.  




 I don't think it's malice or stupidity. I think it is intentionally omitted because they believe there is a possibility these facts could cause panic. I think Obama believes what the CDC says reflects on him and due to the November elections has directly or indirectly told Frieden what he needs to avoid saying and the message necessary to best help the democratic party in these elections. Are these unreasonable things to assume? I'd honestly like feedback on this. 




 Expontentially, 10,000 quickly turns into 100,000 which turns into millions. The CDC predicted 500k to 1.4 million cases by the end of the year. I wouldn't criticize my statistic or epidemiological prowess when you use the current number of cases as a justification for that critisism.  I am not worried about the coming months, but what this will look like in 1, 2 or 3 years. Please explain how exactly I'm fear mongering by advocating for high levels of preparedness and public transparency I specifically did not make any claims either way, just stated facts such as the possibility cannot be discounted of an outbreak in the US in the coming months and years. I want proactive precautions and appropriate dissemination of information and for people to educate themselves and draw their own conclusions. 




 I ask myself these same question  what should we be doing? I think the government should state the facts, we don't know enough about ebola to quantify the risk of a larger outbreak in the US within the coming months and years. It might be small but it is there. This can be used as political fodder, along with the resulting possible public backlash as a justification for a massive increase in the CDC's budget. The same justifications would provide means to substantially subsidize and expedite the clinical trial and mass scale production of a vaccine like ZMapp or VSV. 

The US government could also offer substantial incentives or even require major pharmaceutics companies to work as a singular entity to make this happen. I think the CDC could, with a larger budget and more political weight, work in tandem with the MSF, WHO and US army to set up BSL4 compatible hospitals in the affected areas to mitigate the current damage. Sith sufficient amounts of vaccine to cover the US population, additional vaccines could be produced for the peoples of West African. The US army, working with the other previously mentioned organizations as well as medical sociologists and local leaders could provide a distribution network for the entire affected region. We should be making preparations to do this right now. 




 They wouldn't be 100% avoidable. Unless you were to do something like physically wall that area of the world in, infected people could simply travel over the land to a neighboring country and infect a single person there. If they have a Nigerian passport, they wouldn't be able to fly but this newly infected person could.Walling off these countries is just not feasible unfortunately. A simple air and passport ban on affected countries would greatly decrease the chances of it getting to the US however.

There are also political matters at play here. This would have to come from high up and would probably look pretty callous.. Despite this I have got the impression recent the government won't hesitate to put a travel restriction in place for these countries if even one more person makes it here while infected. 




 We aren't better or separated from nature at all. We ARE nature. Nature is ruthless, callous and indifferent. We are not special, nature is quite literally trying to kill us in a myriad of ways at all times. All we are is an incredibly and unimaginably complex configuration of molecules and chemical reactions which happened to form, replicate and gradually change in ways over a very long period of time. Each generation led to better suited replicating molecules fortheir environment. After a period of 3.5 billion years you go from a single, very simple replicating complex which happened to randomly form to humans. All it takes to kill a significant number of us is another set of molecules, a bit of a simple configuration which mimics us and utilizes our body's metabolic processes and chemicals to replicate itself, a virus. This virus is not malevolent, it is not evil, it is not intentionally killing us, it simply is. Our bodies are pretty fragile, there are a bunch of other threats as well, all of which could eliminate the human race from this short blip of time we call history. It would be like we never existed at all.

 




 ... I only used the word hubris twice in the entire post, 3 if you count the edit. It's an apt and perfectly suited term to concisely express this sentiment. Maybe /r/ebola as a community overuses that word but I honestly am not on here 24/7 or even normally more than 10 mins a day what are yo implying? That word would be over the average /r/ebola subscribed's head? 




 I feel all politicians should be scientifically literate. In fact I'm willing to bet all of those who are of the caliber for a position like POTUS are. They are incredibly smart people with an understanding encompassing many completely topics. It wouldn't surprise me if Obama has never read a research paper or WHO/CDC briefing or report in-depth. He knows the importance of delegation and it is superfluous to read the entire report when he can just be briefed on the main points. 

I can also almost guarantee that both Obama and Frieden have full knowledge of the threat of Ebola and I would love to hear what they actually think off the record. I bet what they have to say would be very realistic and an accurate assessment. Something along the lines of
 Yes it is a real and definite threat. Yes a sizable outbreak will probably eventually occur in the US if vaccinations are not offered to the public on the large scale. However, the time frame for the completion of clinical trials and mass production/distribution of ZMapp or VSV or some other vaccine is on track for completion by a time to minimize the possibility of a large scale outbreak. This is obviously not ideal but there are no further resources at my disposal to change this. I don't have the time or means to completely eliminate any threat but letting the public know this would only induce fear. I would face heavy criticism from the republicans(if it was Obama) for letting this get to a threat level in the first place. They would spin it in a way to make to hurt Democrats and also end use this as fodder to attach my healthcare act and other tangentially if at all related issues. Besides, If I was to be wrong after publicly stating there was a definite threat, I would be criticized as well. As much as I dislike keeping information from the public the reality is that their knowledge of this is irrelevant.

Actually thinking through that response as if I were them makes this whole thing a lot clearer and I understand but object to it. 




 Yep it's a very polarizing topic and unfortunately it seems the government seems to think it necessary to choose either one extreme or the other when making public statements, honestly this choice may be necessary unfortunately. Public hysteria has the potential to be more devastating than Ebola itself and that must be avoided. Maybe I'm naive in thinking the public would be receptive to a middle ground point of view but that would be pretty sad for humanity as a whole if it wasn't true. The government is pretty good at sizing up what the public response to a given scenario would be and maybe they're right.  




 My intention with this post was not to invoke fear or predict ebola is going to be the end of days, I just want to make what I see as the government and scientific community intentionally either misrepresenting things or doing this by omission. I'm sure it doesn't come across this way and have wondered since this post if I am actually contributing to the problem or the solution. I didn't make any claims in the post and tried instead to encourage to not trust a single source, me included and that everyone should do their own research about this threat. I understand how that is probably not the most salient conclusion that was drawn from this post and that is regrettable.

That being said I think it should be made apparent how many unknown factors there are in terms of the scientific understand of ebola before any government statements terms of confidence discussing outbreak potential. In addition, there have been multiple mistakes made according tor quarantine protocol in 100% of the patients treated in the US who were not intentionally brought here and monitored at every step by the CDC. A sample size of 1 is not representative of how closely proper protocols would be handled with 10 or 20 or 100 patients and in fact Texas is likely to be one of the states where hospitals are most unprepared for a patient and the mistakes of Dallas Presbyterian was wake-up call for hospitals everywhere I'm sure and procedures will be praticed upon and improved but it really is not a reassuring level of prepardeness which has been displayed so far. This disease is not going to stop spreading in W Africa and eventually another infected people will make it over here somehow so I just want to ensure that proper and perhaps even superfluous caution is used in these cases due to what we don't understand about ebola. 




 There is a definite fear mongering presence in this subreddit and I'm sure my post is not helping this at all. I was just trying to call attention to what seems to me to be overstating our confidence in terms of ebola as a mininal threat. There isn't enough evidence either way to make claims about outbreak possibility and this uncertainty should statement apparent with any claims made by high profile government officials. I just don't think the public should be coddled.

I agree this is not an end of days, the end is nigh level threat and really tried to keep any fear mongering in my post to a minimum but I'm sure it still comes across that way. I've been wondering if I am contributing to the problem or the solution and I'm really not sure. We will find out in a year or two and hopefully I'll look very silly for making this post.  




 Thank you for caring enough to look into it yourself and not just trusting what you are told. If the average person cared enough to do this more often, making a post like this one would be unnecessary.  




 Because it's versatile word which is directly applicable to the incredibly common human trait, over-confidence? It's a pretty common scenario, common enough to have its own word... I can guarantee you I learned the word through reading and not from reddit but as long as people don't go throwing it around inappropriately hopefully I've introduced a couple new people to the word with this post. 




 I agree, the stress and public scrutiny levels would be overwhelming. At the same time you will get very little recognition if you succeed in containing ebola in terms of public appreciation. That's what expected of you. If you fail however, all the blame comes directly on you and you will be heavily criticized world-wide. If the CDC had successfully contained ebola in terms of the patient in the US or even worldwide we sure as hell would not be thanking them for as long as we have been scrutinizing them and the whole issue would be quickly forgot. 




 These things are not mutually exclusive either. It is not unreasonable to protect yourself before others, in fact it is only natural and there should be no blamed placed on those who do this. We could be doing more help abroad of course, and I advocate we do this while protecting ourselves. 


My ideas about changes to be made to help fight this disease include substantial increases in the funding of the CDC who would work in tandem with the US military to set up hospitals which have appropriate BSL4 precautions. Zmapp or a VSV vaccine/treatment would be massively subsidized and scientists and pharmaceutical companies would be  given incentive or required to work as a single entity to mass produce high enough quantities of this drug to distribute across West Africa along with quantities necessary for distribution to the entire US. This immunization would be either mandatory or readily available with no or minimal cost. The military would would with cultural sociologists, local leaders and medical personelle to implement vaccine distribution across West Africa. This would hopefully work to both halt the spread completely and offer vaccines to every citizen in the US in case we cannot contain the disease. 




 You're right, but the public was told was a minute possibility that it would make it to the US. I remember reading a study claiming a 12.8% chance before the end of the year. I didn't intentionally misrepresent the facts, I was not remember the exact press statements of Frieden and Obama correctly and this caused me to use definitives in my wording when they were not true. 

It wasn't my intention to make things up for fear mongering purposes, thanks for pointing this out and I apologize. 




 What does one thing have to do with the other? Because there are people being affected on an exponentially higher scale halfway across the world and things could be a lot worse, we can't point out flaws in missteps because it isn't respectful? There is absolutely no reason why one thing has any effect on the other outside of the fact that they are both related to a specific disease. 




 I agree. After doing the research and looking at every available ebola study I have access to we don't know enough to make any claims about what is going to happen. My post might come across like ebola is going to decimate the world but what I am trying to say is that we don't understand it well enough to say it won't spread. It most likely will be akin to a hang-nail in terms of effect on the human population. It will definitely be noticeably and cause some pain but you won't die due to it. 

However small the chance of Ebola actually having a large scale outbreak may be, shouldn't we prepare for the worst anyways? Over-preparedness is definitely preferable to being caught off guard. It seems so simple to me and yet I understand this would be an expensive and ardous process which may turn out to be complete overkill. Here's to hoping I am wrong on every single level. 




 The only answer to that is we have absolutely no idea. Theoretically it should be lower but there are a multitude of confounding factors which we know we but don't understand or which are unknown completely which could make it stay the say or every increase. For example it is thought there is a level of innate immunity present in a portion of the West African population due to environmental pressures. It might spread easier here for all we know.  




 I am from Austin but have never been admitted to the ER anywhere in Texas. I am not surprised in this 'nonchalant incompetence' in Texas hospitals however. Of anywhere, Texas was probably one of the worse states for an ebola patient to show up in.

 By the way I like 'nonchalant incompetence' a lot in terms of phrasing. It conveys the actions of hospital employees much better than my description, I will probably steal it in the future. 




  'Yets' and 'buts' don't cut it for me with Ebola. Multiple lapses in quarantine protocol occurred as a direct result of the hospital and state health department and indirectly the CDC . I understand what you are saying, but you have to admit the entire process did not play out according to plan and displayed a level of unpreparedness unacceptable in first world countries. At the same time, you're right this could have played out much much worse. It will serve as the necessary wake up call to drill all hospital in ebola protocols and was probably a blessing in disgiuse. 

* All of the following were avoidable breaches of protocol, any one of which could have resulted in transmittion: 
* Four government employees walked into a BSL4 environment without any protection whatsoever. 
* The patient was sent home with a 103F fever despite the fact he mentioned he was from Liberia. 
* His apartment was not cleared of potential bio hazards because of government bureaucracy and the process of getting permits for this. 
* The ambulance was not properly disinfected after his transport
* Direct family was quarantined without being provided with things like food for a span of a couple of days.
* A nurse presumably incorrectly handled her PPE equipment, most likely by not following protocol to the T when taking the PPE off.

This is not the only time someone with ebola will show up seemingly out of nowhere at a hospital in the US. This level of competency in handling this patient is insufficient to minimize possible transmission risks. All it takes is a single untraced contact to begin a larger scale outbreak. What if it is someone homeless for example, what if it is a food industry employee who does not have insurances and attempts to work through the symptoms. 




 I'd have to put it as slightly forced optimism and frustration at how things are playing out. They work with a high level passion, determination and personal investment in success which of course is conducive to a great amount of stress. These are the some of the smartest people in the world, they work almost 24/7 and they are doing incredible work with what they can. I really hope I am not coming off in anyway resentful towards the CDC employees as that is in no way the case, outside perhaps those responsible for picking their PR stratagems. I admire and respect everyone theregreatly. At the same time I'm glad I'm not in their shoes and am somewhat frustrated not with anyone in particular but with these events. 




 The scary part is that those other people who are "smarter" than you really don't have that much of a better idea than you do. The more you learn about anything the more you realize how much you don't know. 




 Considering how much we don't understand about Ebola I feel any speculation on why we think an outbreak probably won't happen is irrelevant. If there is a chance of a large scale outbreak,  however minute that chance may be,  shouldn't that possibility be addressed?  

Edit: within reason of course. I shouldn't go out and spend millions of dollars because I bought a lottery ticket. The hard part is defining reasonable and unreasonable. 




 I'm sure that is indeed the case. I know for a fact behind scenes scientists have decided to intentionally down play the issue. The masses are being shielded from reality like small children incapable of handling a harsh reality. There is a balance between this and fear mongering which must be met  




 They worded their statements in a way that could cover a huge number of scenarios. If there are 30000 infections would that be considered Ebola spreading widely? It is only about .01% of the U.S. population.  




 If scientists could put their thoughts as poetically as this we'd be in much better shape right now. Aren't many poetic scientists like Carl Sagan, the two qualities don't really coincide unfortunately. 




 Looking at the transcripts of Obama and Friedan announcement's regarding patient 0, it looks like you're right they specify that it would be complete isolated, just contained.

Frieden on 9/30 'The bottom line here is that I have no doubt that we will control this importation or case of Ebola so it does not spread widely in this the country.  It is certainly possible that someone who had contact with this individual, a family member or other individual could develop Ebola in the coming weeks.  But there is no doubt in my mind that we will stop it here.'
Mid-September Obama said 'chances of an Ebola outbreak here are extremely low'.

From a PR standpoint it makes sense to be intentionally vague while implying there would be no further transmission or threat of any level. Maybe that's why I thought they made specific claims but you're right.  I think my general point still stands as the message conveyed is much more important than exact word choice but I shouldn't have claimed those specifics when they weren't actually true.  




 I haven't read any of the most recent rounds of studies but I remember reading a paper that calculated an of R0 1.5-1.9 that was published mid-september I believe. They used WHO reported cases I believe and did mention the fact that these numbers are likely under-reported and it could in fact be higher than this. 




 That's definitely true. I that the expectation of the public that a serious epidemic would be like the movies instead of something gradual over years along with the notion the government is this omnipowerful agency and not something human and fallible can't help either. Before all of this that's sure what I thought. If you had shown me a movie depicting these exact circumstances a year ago it would have made me roll my eyes. I would have thought how the patient was handled in Dallas was a completely ridiculous scenario and government ineptitude like that would never happen in real life.  




 My concern is that R0 may directly correlate with number of infections. As more cases pop up, resources like contract tracing become increasingly difficult. I'm more worried about what this will look like in 2-3 years than anytime soon.  




 I'm currently doing research on in silica genome sequencing algorithms and identification of ORFs and frameshifts and have a degree in Biomedical engineering. 




  Granted this is not a problem in this subreddit so much but this is a small fraction of Reddit. Reddit itself is a cross-section of the a world population consisting mostly of people who are relatively educated, scientifically literate and young. Despite the fact that a transmission of Ebola in the United States is now confirmed, in /r/news replies with speculation like this are still the most upvoted.

[The differences in healthcare, cultural practices,etc.] is why you see the pattern in Africa that you don't, and very likely wont here the US.

This attitude troubles me greatly because the young and scientifically literate Reddit population seemingly agrees with it or else it would not be at the top. Is this not again the same hubris that was displayed with claims that Ebola would **NEVER**to the US? After that was it this same hubris again when US government changed their attitude to OK it got here but there is absolutely **NO RISK** of it spreading to anyone from Mr. Duncan. (Edit: Saying NEVER and NO RISK here was not  entirely accurate there were no definite, quantifiable claims actually made see bottom for more info)  For the second time, this kind of thinking can now be seen for the potentially harmful combination of over-confidence and unrealistic and completely irrelevant optimism it is. The whole thought process that we're Americans, our healthcare system is vastly superior to any West African country, it can't spread is not only wrong but is causing inaction and apathy. We can't keep up this overconfidence when up the risk of Ebola is real and saying that it probably will not spread is of absolutely no relevance. The fact remains it **can** spread and America response so far has only demonstrated a significant level of ineptitude and vulnerability when dealing with Ebola.

This arrogance directly resulted in the whole Dallas fiasco and the spectacular mishandling of patient zero on basically every single level possible. The first real evaluation of our healthcare system with regards to Ebola failed literally on every single level. From the initial misdiagnosis, to the negligent handling of potential biohazard, to the miscoordination of government agencies in the quarantine of possible contacts and now finally to improper protection of the hospital staff. I cannot name a single thing that went right.

As a scientist with a morbid fascination in Ebola, I have been following it since June and have taken the time to look at basically every related peer reviewed article and study. I'm sure many of you are the exact same. I have been saying exactly this over and over again since the response to patient 0 was so obviously negligent. My lab is in Atlanta and the head researcher was hired in August by the CDC for work on Ebola. I know first hand that there is a striking and disconcerting difference between the public image they project and the actual feelings of the employees there. I don't understand the attitude the scientific community is using in the media right now downplaying this issue. It's like a parent not telling their child something because they are afraid it is too serious for the child to completely understand that it could bother them. We need to err on the side of caution rather than worry about how this will look to the public.

I think the best thing that the average person who agrees with this and is as puzzled as I am can be do at this point is to try to change the opinion of anyone and everyone you can. This must be done in a way which is as amicable and non-insulting as possible, as a discussion rather than a lecture, which is kind of hard to do that while getting your point across at the same time. As a community, it might be a good idea to discuss what we can do to point out this hazardous line of thinking and what the most effective way of convincing people to change their minds. A better way of putting it is that you don't want to change peoples minds at all, you want to provide the means for them to convince themselves their  attitude is incorrect. Does anyone have any advice on how to toe the line between fear mongering and reasonable concern? 

**Edit:** The above wording implies high profile officials directly stated ebola would definitely not come to the US and that it absolutely would not spread are not entirely correct according to the wording of the press statements.
 Obama stated in mid september:
'The chances of an Ebola outbreak here in the United States are extremely low.' 

Thomas Frieden, director of the CDC in his press conference on 9/30.
The bottom line here is that I have no doubt that we will control this importation or case of Ebola so it does not spread widely in this the country.  It is certainly possible that someone who had contact with this individual, a family member or other individual could develop Ebola in the coming weeks.  But there is no doubt in my mind that we will stop it here.' 

It was not my intention to make things up for the purposes of my argument and I was more referring to the implications of these statements and how I personally interpreted them along with how I felt the general population did. I didn't look at the exact wording of these statements prior to posting this and was going off memory and should have been more diligent with my claims.  However, the statements are intentionally ambiguous so they don't come back to bite Obama and Frieden in the ass despite a large number of possible scenarios. I feel they also definitely convey a sense of dismissal towards any outbreak possibilities. I believe there is insignificant scientific understanding of ebola in terms of transmission and epidemiology of Ebola to make these claims and this should be made is readily apparent along with any claims. In my opinion press statements about Ebola should be treated with the same levels of scrutiny used in peer review articles. I do not believe any peer review article would have made these exact claims without accompanying them with information about unknowns. 

**Edit 2:** I want to clear something up which is not readily apparent from this post. I am **not** saying ebola is an end of days scenario, that is is going to change the world we live or or disrupt civilization. I am making the point that some of the public sentiment and the attitude of the government towards this disease may be hubris. There are a lot of variables we do not understand about ebola and government and scientific community needs to improve transparency in regards to this fact. I encourage everyone to look at scientific research papers regarding ebola, read as many sources as possible, and listen to what scientists much more knowledgeable than I say. Treat everything with skepticism but you should be able to eliminate any biases by looking in a lot of places. Use this to come to your own concussions and encourage others to do this as well.  




 Remember back when everyone was saying Ebola would **NEVER** spread to the US? After that happened it became there was absolutely **NO RISK** of it spreading to anyone from Mr. Duncan. The whole thought process was we're Americans, our healthcare system is vastly superior to any West African country. I don't think anyone can argue that this was not hubris. We can't keep up this overconfidence when up the risk of Ebola is real and saying that it probably will not spread is of absolutely no relevance. The fact remains it **can** spread and America response so far has only demonstrated a significant level of ineptitude and vulnerability when dealing with Ebola.

This is why you see the pattern in Africa that you don't, and very likely wont here in the US

This is **the exact same hubris** that has been parroted by the CDC and government for weeks. This arrogance directly resulted in the whole Dallas fiasco and the spectacular mishandling of patient zero on basically every single level possible. The first real evaluation of our healthcare system with regards to Ebola failed literally on every single level. From the initial misdiagnosis, to the negligent handling of potential biohazard, to the miscoordination of government agencies in the quarantine of possible contacts and now finally to improper protection of the hospital staff. I cannot name a single thing that went right. 

I'm sorry I don't mean to insult you or anything but I believe your way of looking at this situation is hubris plain and simple. It is actually hurting us in the long run through an inappropriate level of complacency and apathy to what is going on. As a scientist with a morbid fascination in Ebola, I have been following it since June and have taken the time to look at basically every related peer reviewed article and study. Look through my post history and you will find that I have been saying exactly what I am saying now over and over again starting the day after patient 0 diagnosis, when the negligent handling became apparent. 

Although I am not an epidemiologist but more of a geneticist, the genetic community in Atlanta is all intertwined and this obviously includes the geneticists from CDC. The head researcher in my lab is one of the foremost and knowledgeable experts in the world for genome sequencing and expression profiling. He was hired by the CDC in August to track the spread and mutations of this Ebola epidemic and is currently there 4/5 days a week. I do see him daily though as he stops by the lab after work almost everyday. With this view of the inner workings of the CDC, let me tell you there is a striking and disconcerting difference between the public image they project and the actual feelings of the employees there. 

I sincerely hope this post is enough to convince even a single person to take a deeper look this epidemic and realize the potential overreaction is by far preferable to under-reaction for this disease. Please do you own research and come to your own conclusions instead of just trusting what you are told. Obviously this includes the claims I am making right now. Nevertheless, if anyone who is not up to date on the current scientific "state of the union" if you will, with regards to Ebola has any questions feel free to ask. Although there are many much more knowledgeable than I am, I'll do my best. The point of this post is not fear mongering but encouraging a more proactive approach to this problem. I really tried to minimize that any fear mongering but it is always better to err on the side of caution so if my points come across like over exaggerations I apologize. 




 Can't believe they didn't mention movies. After going through the From Ashes demo, I'm convinced movies presented in a VR format similar to From Ashes would be amazing and incredible immersive. I think it has the potential to revolutionize the movie industry. I could see VR potentially replacing current 3D technology with theaters that are VR specific and instead of a single screen consist of a high powered and high resolution Oculus Rift at each seat or something like that. They would be optimized to minimize latency and maximize resolution for complete immersion. I would gladly pay an exorbitant amount of money to see a movie like that.

I've had some pretty bad motion sickness from AI for example but the way From Ashes is presented made me feel no discomfort whatsoever. That program is by far the best use of VR technology I have encountered yet.

 Simplicity in abundance breeds complexity.  




 This is the obvious follow up. Just by the way these are some of my crazy ramblings from that other askreddit elevator thread a day or two ago that I feel like reposting.

You walk into an elevator with a couple people already there. To set the mood you begin with the whole awkward and cliche "I'm sure you're all wondering why I've gathered you here today" thing to them. Awkward silence and maybe a pity laugh ensues. This is just the beginning though.

While "You are my Sunshine" plays over your phone speakers, the seductive and sensual and ever so slow unbuttoning of that trendy and definitely not serial killer-esque trench coat begins. The most important thing to remember here is it you must maintain eye contact with each person for at least 4 seconds and move in sync with the music. If they look away assert your dominance by moving towards them so they have no choice but to be intimidated by your alphaness. 

Obviously you are not naked underneath your trench coat, that's what they expect that's tired and boring. Instead you are wearing a suit made up of fresh fish you caught from the river this morning. After catching each fish, you made a quick mental note of it's personality traits. The reason for this will soon be apparent but it is very important to be in tune with your fish friends. This should be obvious but I'll say it anyways, the fish are secured to that green morphsuit you are wearing underneath the trenchcoat and not directly to your skin. This is of course done with with Velcro for easy fish removal. Based on your fish personality assessment you choose the correct fish to give to each person based on looks and personality. The fish personality must be compatible with the personality of the recipient, this is vital. If they won't take this fish, don't be insulted you prepared for this. You pull out our duct tape and ensure that this person and their kindred fish spirit are bound securely. They will thank you later. Once the person-fish kindred spirits have all been united, you pull out that celebration hotdog you've been keeping for just this occasion. You look at each fish-person with a sense of satisfaction, knowing your duty has been done. In a single bite, you down the hotdog and as the energy in the room reaches it's apex, you hear the ding for your floor. In a single swift turn you leave the elevator and the stunned silence of your ever so cooperative audience is all the thanks you'll ever need. Another day, a couple more fish-human hybrid creatures are now on the prowl. The plan is succeeding.

The most important thing to remember here is it you must maintain eye contact with each person for at least 4 seconds and move in sync with the music. If they look away assert your dominance by moving towards them so they have no choice but to be intimidated by your alphaness. 

Obviously you are not naked underneath your trench coat, that's what they expect that's tired and boring. Instead you are wearing a suit made up of fresh fish you caught from the river this morning. After catching each fish, you made a quick mental note of it's personality traits. The reason for this will soon be apparent but it is very important to be in tune with your fish friends. This should be obvious but I'll say it anyways, the fish are secured to that green morphsuit you are wearing underneath the trenchcoat and not directly to your skin. This is of course done with with Velcro for easy fish removal. Based on your fish personality assessment you choose the correct fish to give to each person based on looks and personality. The fish personality must be compatible with the personality of the recipient, this is vital. If they won't take this fish, don't be insulted you prepared for this. You pull out our duct tape and ensure that this person and their kindred fish spirit are bound securely. They will thank you later. Once the person-fish kindred spirits have all been united, you pull out that celebration hotdog you've been keeping for just this occasion. You look at each fish-person with a sense of satisfaction, knowing your duty has been done. In a single bite, you down the hotdog and as the energy in the room reaches it's apex, you hear the ding for your floor. In a single swift turn you leave the elevator and the stunned silence of your ever so cooperative audience is all the thanks you'll ever need. Another day, a couple more fish-human hybrid creatures are now on the prowl. The plan is succeeding. 




 He obviously meant Dawn's HAZMAT suit duh. He sure got her good she'll have no idea what hit her. This ain't no ordinary prank son its got them BSL4 levels of layers upon layers of prankage going on. 




 If it starts killing them they won't really have a choice. Up until that point if it even happens, yeah I'm sure they will be praising Allah for striking his wrath upon the heretics and their secular culture. A healthy dose of reality(actually a very unhealthy dose) for ISIS in the form of an ebola outbreak in their ranks would sure be interesting to watch them try to rationalize.  




 Lionel Hutz was in there though... I could never forget the great Phil Hartman. 




 Just part 1 of the saga of the Fishophile, a pretty sweet and powerful superhero just trying to reunite man with his long lost fish ancestors and claim his place rightful place as the savior and of man and fish alike. Coming this summer straight from the sea to your living room you'll be hooked from start to fin. 




 God forbid the people putting their life on the line for the sake of complete strangers' health would prefer not to die in one of the worst ways imaginable. While the rest of the world is too afraid to do much of  anything other than worry and watch with a morbid fascination as nations crumble these people are quite literally staring at the faces of a prolonged, painful and utterly unforgiving death. Every night I'm sure they worry about waking up tomorrow on the other side of the looking glass, slowly dying as this apathetic configuration of molecules builds up in their body and literally tears them apart with machine like indifference.

I can't think of a more noble cause. No matter your beliefs, whether your you're a Christian, an atheist, a Muslim or even a member of ISIS you can agree these people are motivated solely by compassion and empathy and complete selflessness. There's not many things the entire world can agree upon but I believe this is one thing that is objectively good no matter how you look at it. These people should have not only whatever they feel is necessary to protect themselves but also a fucking medal, a parade and international recognition and prestige. I like to think of myself of a good person but I could not ever willingly do what they are doing right now.  




 The world just isn't ready for a creature with the body of a man and the dashing good looks of a fish. 




 Without a doubt the worst simpsons circlejerk ever. I can rest assured you were on the internet within minutes registering your disgust throughout the world though.

 Awww, $20!? I wanted a peanut!
$20 can buy many peanuts.
Explain how.
Money can be exchanged for goods and services.
Woo-hoo!

Some of my friends say it's wrong to eat meat
No, Timmy. That's just communist propaganda!

What are you going to do? Release the dogs? Or the bees? Or the dogs with bees in their mouths and when they open their mouths they shoot bees at you? 

Hello chief. Let's talk, why not? You have many questions, Mr, Sparkle. I send you premium - answer question, hundred percent!
I am disrespectful to dirt!! Can you see that I am serious!! Out of my way, all of you. This is no place for loafers! Join me or die! Can you do any less? 




 Hahah damn how could I forget that one? I'm embarrassed now don't judge me too harsh

Hmmm your ideas are intriguing to me and I'd like to subscribe to your newsletter.

 Yep sounds right, unfortunately it's the same for me. I have a little background in genetics but my focus is on automated genome sequencing soI only try to ID coding regions and let those smarter people look at the bigger picture. Only experience I have with immunology is cell physiology and intro to biomaterials back in school so all this is pretty much outside of my comfort zone as well.

I do work closely with a geneticist who spends 75% of his time at the CDC here in Atlanta on genome sequencing for ebola and other infectious diseases who I'll shoot an email about this. I'm sure he probably has some insight. If you'd like I'll let you know what I find out.

Ebola is just so morbidly fascinating it's like watching a horrible car crash you can't peel your eyes away from.

 Is this it? http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/196/Supplement_2/S329.full

Haven't read through it yet but I plan too but it looks like what you are talking about.

Edit: I'm not sure if everyone has access to the full paper so here's a summary.

It took at look at SEBOV(ebola sudan) an the allelles assosiated with cytotoxic T lympocytes antigen-b and their role in fatal and non-fatal cases

Claims:

* Survival is likely dependent on the rapid development of an effective CTL response that limits the level of virus replication before it can overwhelm the body, as is evidenced by increased numbers of activated (HLA-DR+) CD8+ lymphocytes in patients with nonfatal cases
* Expression of the B\*07 allele, which is highly associated with survival, confers a phenotype that efficiently drives T cell activation and CTL epansion early in the SEBOV infection
* B\*67  and B\*15 allelles are highly associated with fatalities (e.g., B67 and B15) and  contribute to an inefficient or unresponsive phenotype 




 What I don't understand is wasn't there a doctor in that group of 4 people who entered the apartment? Typical Texas sheriff I can understand, but a doctor. This just goes to show that the CDC's preaching of direct contact with bodily fluids is a terrible method and leads to hubris causing this.

 Anything the CDC says regarding ebola transmission needs to be something that would make it into a a peer reviewed journal. There is no conclusive proof ebola cannot be transmitted via aerosolized particles. Take it from Charles L. Bailey, who was the head of the government response for the Reston outbreak

"We know for a fact that the virus occurs in sputum and no one has ever done a study [disproving that] coughing or sneezing is a viable means of transmitting, Unqualified assurances that Ebola is not spread through the air Bailey said are misleading."

Prior to this whole thing I always figured the government was competent
on the CDC end at least. They always seemed like this omnipotent entity ready to pop out those PPEs and and L4 biohazard stuff to handle ET at any time.  




 I honestly don't know what you said or what you want me to reply to. I addressed your concerns about the vaccines with questions of my own.

And I thought you knew something about life sciences. Many of these vaccines created from recombinant technology turn out not to work. **Some actually have the opposite effect**. The human body and the immune system are very complex systems.

So the opposite of the intended vaccine would be that it causes you get to get sick no? How is this not a harmful effect?

 There is no telling what a genetically modified organism will do until long and careful testing is done.

I mean yes you do have to make it through phase I and II clinical trials, but NHPs are pretty good models so we will have some idea prior to this. Secondly the VNV platform shows potential for use post-infection as a cure in addition to a vaccine. Finally we can(and have) used this in humans due to extenuating circumstances already with only minor side effects. What do you mean by long and careful testing? The normal regulatory pathways for vaccines, which the government is already helping to expedited for ebola vaccines?

But seriously what are you saying? Oh so there's a possibility this particular vaccine will turn out to be ineffective so fuck it lets not even try there's no hope? 

If you'd like to learn a little more here's a good paper regarding the VNV vaccine. Pretty recent too... 9/27

 Yes and this is with what 8000 ebola infections? That number will increase 30 fold in the next few months. What happens if it makes it's way into the Indian slums or into poverty stricken parts of China? Ebola HAS(I guess slighly debatable due to semantics) and WILL continue to spread inside and sooner or later outside of Africa. It is not going to burn out, it is not going to just go away if we ignore it and it will be a problem for years to come. We don't understand it well enough to have this smug complacency that the reason it can spread in West Africa but can't in first world countries is solely due to economic and infrastructure inferiority and cultural differences. I predict we'll find out if this is in fact the case very soon.

I'm not saying there will be a global, society break down due to ebola but is one of the most, if not the most threatening diseases in terms global repercussions of our generation. Maybe I'm over reacting, maybe I'm over analyzing this and I hope I am but the fact remains the scientific community is still very much in the dark on many aspects of ebola. For example transmission potential, potential reservoirs, ex vivo viability, among many other important characteristics remain unknowns. Of course publicly Scientists would never say this but here in Atlanta, working on genome sequencing research with CDC staff who work on ebola sequencing and have an ebola understanding equal to anyone in the world is not as reassuring as you might think. Behind the scenes, experts have decided the best approach PR wise is a confident, definitive and relaxed demeanor regarding the threat of ebola. These scientists make bold, often misleading comments which would not make it into any peer reviewed article. 

If you ask ask a scientist during an interview if the disease is airborne they well emphatically say no, direct contact with bodily fluids only. Press them a little bit and they will say well yes, aerosolized particles produced while for example coughing or sneezing do have the possibility for infection. This is in an example of how the disconnect between scientific terminology and popular usage can be use to kind of intentionally misrepresent the situation. The general public considers transmission through sneezing,etc to to be airborne, while this does not fit the scientific definition of airborne transmission. Take it from Dr. Charles L. Bailey the virus researcher who supervised the government response to the Reston outbreak. "We know for a fact that the virus occurs in sputum and no one has ever done a study [disproving that] coughing or sneezing is a viable means of transmitting, Unqualified assurances that Ebola is not spread through the air are misleading."

Another example is asymptomatic transmission. Any expert will emphatically state there is NO chance of transmission before presenting symptoms. Press them a little farther and they will admit there is a 1-2 day "grey zone" where the virus does have a risk of transition but symptoms are not readily apparent. 

This blatant misrepresentations of the facts is not OK when dealing with a Class IV bio hazard outbreak. The government should NOT be coddling the public with definitive assertions when there is no conclusive evidence to substantiate this assertions. This causes complacency in both the general public and hospital staff. This disconnect and downplay of the serious situation may have led to Texas Presbyterian Hospital to dismissing that infamous patient with recent travel history in Liberia who was presenting flu like symptoms with only antibacterials. This hubris may have resulted in 4 government officials walking into that patient's apartment before it was disinfected with no PPE at all. This apartment was technically a level 4 biohazard area meaning personnel must enter and leave only through the clothing change and shower rooms, shower each time they leave the facility. Supplies and materials are brought in through double-doored autoclave, fumigation chamber, or airlock, which is appropriately decontaminated between each use. Of course this is kind of hard to set up in an apartment complex but there is a middle ground. If this Sheriff turns out to be ebola positive, which is unlikely I hope, these misrepresentations of the scientific facts may have cost that man his life.

If you actually read through all that dribble you probably need to reevaluate your life...Heute Westafrika, morgen die ganze Welt.  




 Granted my understanding of recombinant vaccines is by no means comprehensive but I do work on genetic sequencing algorithms and alignment pipelines so I feel somewhat comfortable discussing it. It seems that live attenuated VSV based vaccines show considerable promise.  Of course the lack of real clinical trials means much work has to be done but VSV efficacy in NHP models is reassuring. As far as I can tell, the risks of this specific vaccine based on NHP models and a compassion administration to an exposed researcher seem to be reasonably minimal. Although not conclusive with an n=1, a mere 12 hour fever post administration with no other health effects in the only human trial  combined with the lack of pre-existing VSV immunity and no mention of adverse short-term effects in NHP models point to this being a viable vector. The potential loss of protection after 6 months-1 year is not ideal either but this is infinitely better than nothing.

Why is there no telling what a genetically modified organism will do until long after careful testing is done? Can you provide any citations of long term health effects from recombinant vaccines? I don't mean to sound condescending, just am genuinely curious. I assume unwanted gene knockdown or immune system responses would be the cause of this?

The emergence of public awareness, concern and interest in Ebola recently means these experimental vaccines will and already are being fast tracked. West Africa will in all likelihood get very little of any of these newly developed vaccines when they arrive though, unless it's for clinical trials to prove efficacy. Ebola won't be contained there without a huge surge in levels of organized humanitarian action and international altruism on an unprecedented level. The world will be feeling the effects of this for years to come. 

That being said your tone is very condescending. As I see it you are basically saying reality is what I say it is, anyone who disagrees with my sensible and rational points should be dismissed because they just see me as a fear mongering racist. I have seen the exact opposite on this subreddit, with extremist and pessimistic opinions regularly topping the comments section. Tone down the smug almost insulting attitude a bit and maybe you won't be dismissed as a racist fear monger quite so much. 




 On Tuesday after the first US diagnosis: probably around a 5.

 Yesterday after hearing about the multiple mishaps by the hospital and CDC: 6

Today after hearing about the almost criminal negligence by the Dallas health department; power washing the parking lot with absolutely no protective gear, the fact potentially ebola ridden bedding and towels remained in the apartment and the fact that the family members had not been briefed about what to do: A 7 or 8 




 Here's my assessment of the situation:

Looking at flights from Monrovia to Brussels, if I want to travel ASAP I can get a flight for $1,280 on Monday Oct. 6. It looks like they have flights out every monday and friday according to http://www.brusselsairlines.com/en-be/destinations/liberia/monrovia.aspx

I was honestly expecting for it to be more like two weeks and I looked this up to try to prove he probably had booked the flight prior to exposure on the 15th. Now I can't discount it as a legitimate possibility that he booked the flight ASAP after that fateful taxi ride in Monrovia. My only qualm is why he would not be candid with the healthcare staff about believing to have ebola if he just wanted ZMapp. Why would he have been content with going home with just antibiotics on the 26th? My only answer is maybe when western doctors didn't think it was ebola, it was what he wanted to hear so badly he started to think his fears were unfounded. He desperately was hoping not to have ebola and this confirmation was enough to assuage his worries until the 28th when he couldn't ignore the truth any longer. I don't know but this all definitely raises some questions. 




 They need to quarantine every single one of the 80+ along with their close contacts as well. 500 people quarantined in their homes with posted guards ensuring they stay put and providing them with food etc. is a small price to pay to stop an outbreak of a diseases with has a 50% mortality rate. If for nothing else, do it for peace of mind even if the quarantine number is superfluous. The government needs to err on the side of caution rather than worrying about how this will look PR wise. It will look a lot worse in 21 days if this is not stopped.

 It's more a darker red to maroon although I'm sure those words mean nothing to you. 




 And the CDC knows exactly who these people are. 




 Basically they knew this could happen but short of stopping all flights from the infected areas there is no way to stop it from happening. On top of that, this isn't Africa patient isolation and contact tracing is much easier here so controlling the outbreak, which has proved effective in Nigeria and Senegal is easier as well. 




 According to the CDC, this person is not an American citizen, he wasn't traveling over there. He traveled to the US to visit family. 




 Only counts if its ebola poo 




 In this case it may help, it cannot hurt to take extra precautions to prevent the spread of ebola and if public opinion causes that to happen I'd say it's a good thing even if the actual risk to US residents is minimal. Although I'm not sure there is much more we can do here in the US at this time as all medical staff have already been briefed on ebola protocol. 




 Even if this is true, which I don't it is as I'm pretty sure the person was traveling over a week ago not within the past week, the CDC press conference made it absolutely clear there was no risk of transmission during the flight. 




 The individual was not showing symptoms on the flight. Ebola isn't transmittable until you show symptoms. The CDC representative was very clear during the press conference that there was no risk of transmission on the flight or in the airport. 




 What's the only thing happier than a 3 legged dog? A four legged dog. 




 Yeah I know right. I'm 24 and am just now confronting my mortality. Doesn't help considering about 3 hours ago I was in the hospital, sedated and undergoing an endoscopy among other things because of a possible ulcer. Luckily it was just the beginning stages of an ulcer and was caught very early but the whole ordeal was still a harsh reality check . 




 Yeah I'd warm her icy heart with a nice hot island fuck. 




 Damn that's scary stuff. Unbelievable that something like that can just happen to a healthy 22 year old. 




 Damn, wish I was still at my tedious system test job so I could listen to those all day. I was able to listen to pretty much every free one he has before I left for the summer but now I can't bring myself to podcasts cause at school I feel I should either be focusing on work or watching something. 




 What do you know about the cost effectiveness of switching to PEG? That would great reduce carcinogen production. 




 Currently, webm media doesn't expand using viewimages. As much of the webm media posted on reddit are basically gifs, it would make sense for those to be displayed along with images. Webm media with sound wouldn't fall under this category. 

A toggle option for this would be ideal as well.

Edit: damnit I just read the title, any mod want to remove "as well when"? The meaning isn't clear and I meant to edit it before submitting. 




 Oops I always make that mistake.  VG, EG and PG all sound exactly the same and I was debating which one it was while typing. Should have just looked it up. 




  The biggest problem in determining if ecigs are safe or not is that most tests on the chemicals used in the liquids are based upon consumption, not inhalation. I doubt that we will have a definitive answer about how to safe e-cigs really are for some time.

From what we know right now, vaporization of VG and PG(the solvents nictoine are dissolved in) produce 1 known carcinogen, formaldehyde and 2 potential ones,acetaldehyde and acrolein. The levels produces vary based on the voltages used in vaping. Most ecigs range from 3.2-4.8V and at 4.8V the level of formaldehyde produced is 200x greater than 3.2V and is comparable with formaldehyde produced in cigarettes.  A 3.2V the level of formaldehyde is 807 lower than that of cigarettes and at 4.0V it is 13x lower. The other 2 carcinogens vary in the same manner. I am not 100% the quantification of the carcinogen levels is on a per puff basis but I believe it is 

Another potential hazard is vaping produces particles 30 micros in diameter which the lung may have trouble expelling. But there is no conclusive evidence of that yet as far as I know.

[Source:](http://www.ecigarette-research.com/web/index.php/2013-04-07-09-50-07/2014/162-nyt-formald) and the peer reviewed articles I have read about the subject. I'm a biomedical engineer so I'm fairly scientifically literate on these things. 




 First of all, they could seriously fuck up Seoul before we could do anything about it. Second the population is seemingly extremely brainwashed. Many North Koreans would not respond well to being invaded by the country they've been taught is the evil enemy their entire lives. Third the huge out flux of refugees would cause problems for China and South Korea. South Korea has said they'd be willing to take in refugees but China sure as fuck would not want it. 









 Yeah I think you're right, didn't they include a message at the bottom of the page saying some results of your search have been redacted due to DMCA? Maybe I'm remember wrong but for a while there I thought you could just click the message to get the omitted results.

 I'm just surprised bing hasn't implemented a filter to completely get rid of all the leaked nudes in their search results. It wouldn't be that hard to do. 




 That's a good point. I wondering if microsoft will get threatened for having this come up on the first page of search jennifer lawrence fappening. Pretty similar issue.

 Complete bullshit as thumbnails are fair use.

Here's the precedent:
Fair use. A search engines practice of creating small reproductions (thumbnails) of images and placing them on its own website (known as inlining) did not undermine the potential market for the sale or licensing of those images. Important factors: The thumbnails were much smaller and of much poorer quality than the original photos and served to help the public access the images by indexing them. (Kelly v. Arriba-Soft, 336 F.3d. 811 (9th Cir. 2003).)


 
Fair use. It was a fair use, not an infringement, to reproduce Grateful Dead concert posters within a book. Important factors: The Second Circuit focused on the fact that the posters were reduced to thumbnail size and reproduced within the context of a timeline. (Bill Graham Archives v. Dorling Kindersley Ltd., 448 F.3d 605 (2d Cir. 2006).)


Fair use. A Google search engine infringed a subscription-only website (featuring nude models) by reproducing thumbnails. Important factors: The court of appeals aligned this case with Kelly v. Arriba-Soft (above), which also permitted thumbnails under fair use principles. (Perfect 10, Inc. v. Amazon. com, Inc., 508 F. 3d 1146 (9th Cir. 2007).)

 They thing is will not and could NOT get sued because of this. They were not hosting any pictures except thumbnails and thumbnails have precedent of being consider fair use. No lawyer would ever consider taking that case to court. If they recieved DMCA threats it was a scare tactic and that's all. Their hypocrisy is is fucking maddening

Stop giving us bullshit and saying it's because of DMCA threats.

Fair use. A search engines practice of creating small reproductions (thumbnails) of images and placing them on its own website (known as inlining) did not undermine the potential market for the sale or licensing of those images. Important factors: The thumbnails were much smaller and of much poorer quality than the original photos and served to help the public access the images by indexing them. (Kelly v. Arriba-Soft, 336 F.3d. 811 (9th Cir. 2003).)


 
Fair use. It was a fair use, not an infringement, to reproduce Grateful Dead concert posters within a book. Important factors: The Second Circuit focused on the fact that the posters were reduced to thumbnail size and reproduced within the context of a timeline. (Bill Graham Archives v. Dorling Kindersley Ltd., 448 F.3d 605 (2d Cir. 2006).)


Fair use. A Google search engine infringed a subscription-only website (featuring nude models) by reproducing thumbnails. Important factors: The court of appeals aligned this case with Kelly v. Arriba-Soft (above), which also permitted thumbnails under fair use principles. (Perfect 10, Inc. v. Amazon. com, Inc., 508 F. 3d 1146 (9th Cir. 2007).)

 Yeah but any non nudes still would have been fair game if this wasn't the precedent. 




 I'm sure she owns the copyright and any site hosting the image does need to take it down or be sued. A lot of people think the reason reddit got DMCA notices is because of the thumbnails. Reddit probably got threatened with a lawsuit but there has been multiple precedents set according the DMCA fair use and thumbnails. They would have never been taken to court.

 According to some precedent set thumbnails fall under fair use.

The thumbnails thing sounds a little fishy to me.

 Here is what I found on thumbnails being considered fair use in multiple cases.

 /r/thefappening was technically legal though. Linking to DMCA  content is allowed, hosting it is where it gets illegal. 




 That celebrities should get preferential treatment because they have more money and are better than average every day people? 




 This may be the greatest news I've ever heard. 




 I don't believe in god either but I'm sorry for how this asshole(benshiffler) is acting. I honestly believe if everyone lived their life according to the true message of the new testament the world would be a better place. It is people who corrupt this message and cherry pick what they want to believe when the real meaning is basically love everyone and be good to everyone no matter what. 

Obviously there are religious assholes but obviously there are also some overzealous atheist assholes as well, case in point benshiffler. In the end I don't really see any difference between the two a lot of people are selfish narrow-minded dicks on both sides of the equation. I just wanted to let you know not all of us no-believers are this way. 




 Yeah, November is a fake month make up by those crafty chickens so people kill more turkeys. 




 All that Perl coding must have gone to OP's head 




 I ate freebirds every single day when I worked there over the summer. Gained like 15 lbs but it was totally worth it those were some of the most delicious days of my life. After eating there 4+ days a week I still wasn't tired of it by the end, I think that's saying something. 




 So I go to Georgia Tech and had Dr. Potter as a professor last semester in neuroengineering fundamentals. I'm not exactly sure about how the neurons recognize the goal of flying the plane but I do remember him discussing something similar to this in class.  I want to say the neurons encounter negative feedback when the plane crashes and positive feedback while the plane is flying. So they "learn" how to avoid crashing keep flying but don't quote me on this. Really interesting stuff though he was the most passionate professor I have ever had!
