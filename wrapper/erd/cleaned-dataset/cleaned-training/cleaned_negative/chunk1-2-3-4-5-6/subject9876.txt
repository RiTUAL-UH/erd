 A Playing nook is awesome or you can do the room of harry potter. But first let your son watch the whole harry potter series so that he can appreciate it so that he'll think youre a cool parent. By the way  i like your stairs  




 There are some things that a computer cant do but i dont think computers are a bad thing it makes  work life easy and it's up to the user on how he would want the computer to work to his advantage 




 Definitely. Neutral colors are the best. 




 Good thing you didnt. You know how preggy ladies are with their hormones...  









 Simple   yet the creativity involved to collab is rad. Hahaha. Wanna collab with my snoring?  




 Gaining momentum for spilling additional fluids.  




 NASA could use that as a corporate give-away or token. 




 Wrong timing. :p (audience cue) 




 Alpha-ing small dog. heh heh heh 




 Hopefully no rats will enjoy the tube maze. 





























 This is very sad considering that most mental illness can be cured with proper medication  









 Of course there's money  




 Wow thanks for sharing that I mean some architects are in it for the money. But I think you found your passion. Keep it up!  









 So what will happen ? Will you get back the amount that they charge you with?  




 How much did you get it for ?  




 This just tells us that life is more than what we learn in school. Giving up something you love and never regretting your decision is the most noble thing a person can do. Im pretty sure cameron lyle would make a great impact not only to the person he saved but also to alot of people going through the same thing  




 Ok thanks and im sorry

 So is it worth it so far?  




 So was it all worthit?  
























 Way to go buddy! What life you've had there! 









 I admit I also read it a couple of times before totally understanding the story. And when you do, you'll really appreciate the novel. Maybe reading still depends on the interest of the reader. I for one cannot get the hang reading the likes of Robert Kiyosaki.  




 I wonder how far can technology go. And can human catch up? What's next after nano-? 




 They should have found an alternative long ago considering the vast profit that they have amassed from their patrons (meaning the loyal children who begged their parents for this very expensive toy). That is if they were really concerned about the welfare of many and not just for their own personal gains.  









 Reading is good for everyone, so I am happy when there's a new recruit. And to add to your future reads, 'Brothers Karamazov' by Dostoyevsky is a good one.  




 Leave it as it is. History is imprinted on it already. Just create a copy and put color on it instead. Sometimes, we do more harm than good on things that should have been left alone. 









 They should have done that a long time ago instead of spending more of their national funds on nuclear power plants which they know are harmful to their people.  

















































 We should all learn from the deaf frog which climb the tree: Life is unpredictable and nothing is guaranteed, so dont delay and start living your dream today! Don't let your fears prevent you from achieving your dreams.  














 Congratulations, man! Take this experience to enhance your skills and your knowledge. Show respect to everyone you work with, particularly to those lower than you. They'll help you climb up the ladder to your success.  




 Would definitely want to see this up close. The design seems cold, but seeing something bending the rule of architecture is surely eye catching.  




 That's one great workmanship! And way more satisfying than having someone do it for double, maybe triple the price.  




 People have so many concerns at the moment that they wouldn't even bother to know why someone got fired. And even without a job, she surely can survive. A tough woman there.  




 This looks okay, but would want to drink coffee while shopping? I know I don't. Sorry.  




 How far can architecture go? Hold on tight, so you wouldn't be swept away by the fast moving technology.  




 I read this from the Internet, and I know I had to share it. It will make you think of the phrase: You come in this world with nothing and you die with nothing. One man obviously didnt feel this was the case when he asked his wife, When I die, can you bury all of the money with me?.

He wanted her to put it all in the casket with him. Thinking that she would fulfill his last dying wish he thought nothing more of it.

During his working life this man was a real cheapskate, and only spent when he really had to. He saved it all in this little shoe box you can see below.

When he eventually passed away, He was laid out and his wife sat next to her life-long friend. When the ceremony was just about to finish, and the coffin was about to be covered he wife screamed, Wait one second!.

He was stretched out in the casket, the wife was sitting there in black next to their best friend. When they finished the ceremony, just before the undertakers got ready to close the casket, the wife said, Wait a minute! She walked over and placed the shoebox in the casket.
Her friend asked her, Surely you werent silly enough to put all that money in there! The women responded, Yeh I had to keep my promise, I am a good Christian, Id never break a promise.
The friend said, What! You put every last cent in there with him?!
The women responded, No, I counted it all up, put it in my bank account, and wrote him a cheque!
 









 The reaction of the baby is just so wonderful that it makes me feel sad when he finally realized that not everything he sees is beautiful. But still, the good thing is he can see the beauty of his family.  














 We should not have discrimination like these animals.
