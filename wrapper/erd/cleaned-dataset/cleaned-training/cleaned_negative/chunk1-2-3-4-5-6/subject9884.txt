 I always wandered: I am not from America. Does this 499 include your sales tax? If not, how much do you end up paying,  say, in Houston?  




 Most people won't even stand where that car is in the picture.  




 I've got one for you. Maybe not original but at least never heard of it. 

You know how Google Picasa and other softwares ask you to tell them what the name of a face is that the software recognises on your pics? It is linked to a contact in your phone. In case you save your contacts with full name they know the name of that person and their face (also tel no and possibly email,  bla bla bla). Now as soon as the software knows the name and possible waits for a verification from a different user they start tracking where ever that person was. Somebody is taking a picture of something with me in the background? Picasa saves geo data and tells Google where I was that day at that time. This way a map is created of where I went with evidence. Could be used to prove you haven't done this or that but it will only be used against you.  




 Op, please share how you took and edited the picture  




 Pacific Rim. 
Everything about the movie sucks. Worst:

Acting

The fact that the monsters don't use their emp's straight away

That one of the jagers uses a boat instead of the awesome sword he apparently has 




 I down vote you for the second part of your post. What are trying to do? Shame people into not down voting you?  




 If you don't like it you don't like it, that's fine. But for me it is one of the most important things I have ever watched. Two of the main characters, Jack and Daniel, have actually influenced me a lot. I still think that trying to be a bit of both will make the perfect human being. The two of them unite traditional values and open-mindedness perfectly. They are and forever will be my role models.

 Thank you for pointing out my error. Got it now.  




 Sorry, I did not read galaxy. I read universe. Sorry for the question.  




 When we do such an estimation, does that include observable universe only or more than that. In case of the latter, how do we estimate? 

Edit: sorry, my bad. I read universe, not galaxy.  




 Thank you! 




 I have 0% knowledge but I am willing to learn hard. 

If you could help me get started I would be very grateful.  




 I went to a Nike outlet to buy some running shirts and shorts and saw that the Nike Hyperfeel were only 80 so I bought a pair. I ran in them today and I liked it. 

By chance I walked past my usual shop and went in because I was curious what my usual salesman had to say about them. 

Long story short. He said that:
- Nike uses some of the worst foams in the industry which don't provide good support
- He has a ton of customers that came into his shop because they have trouble with their achilles tendon and their knees after using any nike free run shoes. 
- Even walking for long periods of time is bad for knees and achilles tendon. He said that if I run with them (I am quite heavy and mostly land on the back of my foot) I will have problems in the future with my hip and knees
- They basically are a shit shoe that costs nothing to make (he said $2.50 but I am not sure if he was just saying a low number) and is being sold with a ridiculous profit margin thanks to Nike's marketing.
- it has been developed in Germany at the Sporthochschule Koeln and that some people involved make their money with knee replacements
- on top of all of that he does not sell Nike because for him it is a fact that they use child labour (however he does realise that this is a difficult discussion. Anyway it is his shop so it's his choice)

He was able to explain everything very well and I have to say that I believe him but I could not find anything online so I am curious where he gets this information. 

What do you gusy think? 




 Why is that? What alternative is there that is better? Rotten tomatoes, where toy story 3 is the best movie of all time?  




 I really do 




 God I was scared when I saw I had a message but I thinks it's so good and nice. This is everything I wanted.. I showed her and she was so surprised. She doesn't know reddit and thought it would all be crap. Thank you so much.

 Yeah, sounds pretty amazing.  









 I just love Germany sometimes.

 NB looks a LOT cheaper than Nike.  




 I don't actually. And if I am honest, I don't even know what that is. Considering my wrist hurts right now, I guess I will be reading up on that tonight. 

Thanks for the advice 




 Sorry, the sandals. I'm sure they are not because I guess people would not recommend them.  




 Yeah, I saw that just now. What the hell. 

I guess I'll just keep using my running shoes then.  




 Thanks. I'll consider it. 

They look difficult to run in if you ask me.  




 My GF made that same experience. If you need to get started with easier exercise I recommend this. It's the all time top post here. It is what I am doing and I really love it. I am sure the easiest exercises will be fine for anybody.

 Hmm, I am done in about 1 hour - 1 hour 20 mins. 
I run 5 mins, do 

handstand 3 sets

push ups 3 sets

squats 3 set

pull ups 3 sets

leg raises 3 sets

vertical pulls 3 sets

then I run for 20 minutes and then stretch for 5. 

I feel like 2 hours would kill me.  




 I prefer shoes. It does not have to be THAT inexpensive. I am also not a fan of blisters. 




 Any recommendation for some inexpensive shoes for this? 




 I hate horse girls.

I would have not expected that from this guy... 




 Thank you for posting this. I wanted to ask you to share. How long did it actually take? 




 Haha! 
Love it.  




 I want to live in Asia, North and South America and Australia for at least a year each. I think it must be so enriching to experience the differences and would surely make you more understanding.  




 I mean that parents fail to teach this and children who don't look so cool or don't have a smartphone seem to fall behind even if they are super nice people.  




 Old people (40+) like me, which is a massive advantage at work.  




 They invited you, so you can't be that bad of a candidate. They are testing you, play along. 




 Treat people based on how they behave, not how they look or what they have. This is becoming a problem.  




 And it is true 




 In the summer: White Wine Spritzer

I get a lot of shit from my mates... 




 Because they are confident. People always say this. From my point of view there is so much more to this:

- The woman you are talking about could be a dickhead too
- Maybe the guy just looks like a douche but is actually nice and not at all a dick. I have met guys like that. But maybe they are confident and that's why you think they are, well, what you said above
- I know lots of women who are not with the type of guy you are talking about even though they are fit. You are probably paying more attention to people who confirm your suspicion. 
- Confidence makes really sexy and these guys have a lot of that.  




 Why do they always try to push boundaries? 




 Ask them something stupidly arrogant but at the same time make sure your question show that you do not actually understand yourself, like:

What is a prime number of 5?

See how she/he reacts.  




 I did and I hate myself for it. 

Edit: Ah sorry, I am not married. It was/is my GF.  




 A friend of mine works as a flight attendant. After the flight she has to hold up a basket with tiny chocolates. So many people think they are so funny when they say:

"I'll take the whole basket!" whilst making a move for it and stopping just before they actually touch it.

 The article mentions real antisemitic happenings. However the "Zentralrat der Juden" in Germany is not differentiating. For them it is all them same it seems. Everybody who opposes Israel is an antisemit. They are calling for solidarity ([here](http://www.tagesspiegel.de/meinung/zentralrat-der-juden-fordert-mehr-solidaritaet-das-hier-ist-deutschland-2014-nicht-1938/10276918.html) in German) which is ridiculous. 

Not that I am saying any jewish people anywhere in the world shuld feel unsafe because of the actions of the Israeli government. However the "Zentralrat der Juden" a powerful Jewish organisation is, like the Israeli government, immune to reason and accountability.   




 Ok, that is awful. I did not know about this.  




 Forget about the evil merchant. The Israeli government is currently killing children in Gaza as far as I know. 

It is not the right way to go about it though. I do agree with that.  




 Well, same thing happened to Merkel being compared to Hitler. There are always some idiots. But I understand there is also some "well behaved" criticism that Israel does not want to accept.   




 http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2c8i8w/nato_bombed_5000_civilians_in_kosovo_just_because/

For example. I have read something similar in Der Spiegel. 




 The way I see it Israel is trying to shame people into being quite about what Israel is doing to the people living in Gaza. 

Just because the people in Israel who commit these crimes are Jewish does not mean that people who oppose them are being antisemitic. 









 I really like Marc O'Polo ()

It's kind of hard to get outside of Germany but the quality is amazing and the stuff looks brillian.  




 When you post, please also post webaddress of online shops and price

 = not so cheap (Nike)
= really not cheap at all (Ralph Lauren)
 = expensive (you know, the stuff nobody buys)

I would love to get to know some cool brand not everybody knows. 
 




 Was it really? I just ignored it because I was a bit annoyed with the fact it does not end.  




 Installed it, love it!

Thanks! 




 I am using an HTC One M7 with SentinelRom 6.0. It is based on CM11. Do you guys know how I can integrate all my facebook contacts and calendars?

I would really appreciate some help.  




 I have been doing bodyweight fitness for a short while now and I really like it. I feel good because I am doing something to improve my body. I cannot yet see a big difference but the fact that I am working out regularly makes a big difference to my state of mind. However, there is a downside. Well, two actually.

1. My thighs have become bigger and now my suits do not fit me anymore. I can almost not wear my trousers anymore when I have my phone and wallet in my pockets. 

2. I am not sure if I am imagining this, but because there is less space available between my thighs and also in my trousers, my testicles started hurting. 

Has anybody had a similar experience? 
Any suggestions how to deal with it? 

BTW second problem is much worse than number 1.  




 Hi,

I am trying to use the kernel for the SentinelRom 6.0 provided by the dev

https://github.com/CyanogenMod-11/android_kernel_htc_m7

But I do not know how. I understand that you need the zip and need to flash it in the recovery. I downloaded the zip on that page (right side of the screen) but it always says failed, when I try to flash it. 

Do you guys know how to do it?

Many thanks in advance.

 I find imdb.com incredibly useful to get information about movies I might want to watch and also I like to idea of keeping a record of what I have watched and how I liked the movie right after I watched it. 

I would love to know if there is anything similar.  














 Like said I got it as a present which is why I am reading it. 

I saw that it has 7000 reviews on amazon.co.uk with 4.5 stars average which I think means that it is a very popular book. Also I heard lots of people talk about it. 

I have read the first 80 pages and really struggle to keep reading. The reasons are:

- The life of the protagonist seems super unrealistic. I read it and think that even though I know it's fiction there is no way I can believe this story or identify myself with it. 
- The jokes he makes seem calculated and also it seems like it's not genuine. It seems like he has taken the kind of humour from somebody else because it was successful.
- Last but not least I read, that he wote a second book which follows the exact same scematic as this one. I dislike that because it lacks heart. 

What do you gusy think? Shall I keep reading? 














 Hey guys, 

I have started bodyweight fitness but would like to learn a bit more about the results that I can expect if I am diligent. 

My primary goal is not to gain strength for the sake of it. I would say that I don't lack strength because I have always been working out. I am a little too fat though and I find that I cannot move the way I would like to because of it.

My goal is to get rid of some of my fat and get lean. I do not actually want to get a lot bigger because I have very wide shoulders as it is and I am quite short. I have started the routine that is suggested in one of the top posts (the one that has a picture of all the different progressions in it. I was able to star pretty much everything in the middle.

I would love to know if other people had the same goal and if they succeeded.

Oh, and I want to be able to do one armed push ups, of course. ;)

I'd appreciate any feedback. Progression picks always good 














 I was just thinking, if we were to colonize for example Mars, could we actually fly planes there? 

















































 I really like to see people's handwriting. I have seen some really beautiful ones and it always amazes me. [Here](http://imgur.com/m2545wF) is mine FYI.

Apparently it contains every letter of the alphabet. I did not bother to check... 




 I moved to London 2 years ago and have been working quite a lot. 

I would like to get back to making music. Anybody interested? I produce hip hop and r b. I would love to meet singers or writers. 

Let me know if you're interested. 

Maybe you can meet somebody else here who in interested in your type of music too.  




 So, I have been reading some books and saw one video trying to explain 11 dimensions. Then I had a though. I am really not good at explaining it but I'll try my best.

Maybe the universe is not actually endless, it is just a closed loop. Imagine somebody who is only able to perceive 1 dimension. his world looks like this ------------ . He can move left and right. If you put both ends of his world together you get a circle. Now if the person would walk left (or right) for long enough he would realise he is living on a cirlce because he will get back to the start. Now if the circle is bigger than the person can travel in a lifetime, he will never get back to the start and will therefore think his universe in endless. 

If you apply the same to a 2D world the person can walk left, right, up and down. Again, his world might seem endless to him, but in fact it might just be a sphere too big for him to travel across in one lifetime. 

Now what if that is the same with our universe? Maybe it is actually folded in such a way that whichever direction you traveled you would eventually get back to Earth. Because we live in it and cannot perceive the next dimension up, our minds cannot picture such a folded 3D object but that doesn't mean its not possible. 

For me this would be much easier to understand that to grasp infinity.

I hope I explained myself good enough for people to understand. 

TL;DR: Universe is not actually infinite, just a folded 3D onject (similar to a circle in 1D and a sphere in 2D). We will just never find out because it is too big for us to travel. 

What do you think? 










































































 Religious people might object, but as I see it, there is no universal authority that determines "If you do this, then this should happen to you."  




 I think it would be interesting to know:
How much do people earn on average (maybe you can estimate)
How much rent do you pay (is that in the expensive or cheap part of town?)
How much does it cost to go out? 




 I would like to know what features you like that your system does not have, but the other one does.  


































 Even taking into consideration that 2D maps are not accurately showing the world and that Earth is not a perfect sphere, I do not understand why a plane would fly over the sea north of Russia to get from London to Tokyo (for example). Please, can somebody explain? 
























 Thanks for that. I can't believe that happened.  




 Whatever, then. I'm not interested then.  




 Not one person here can tell me how tall or heavy they are in metric units, bro. Also people measure their dicksize in inches, bro.

 Hi guys, is there anything like the auto hibernation of greenify for non rooted phones? (z3c) 




 It is not only because there are other 5+ inch devices that are also good. It's because a big screen phone is nothing new. But a phone that you can use with one hand which has a great battery life and still is a flagship has not been seen so far  




 I am curious what rich people think poor (poorer) people are doing that is stupid or unreasonable. Why do you think they are poor or not as rich as you.

Anything goes.  




 Thanks 




 Cool. Thanks. That is what I was hoping for.  




 ah, ok. I started with a little under 84kg and now I am at 81. I read that losing 0.5kg per week is not healthy and realistic. I have been working out for more than 2 months now. 

Actually, writing it down it seems perfectly fine progress. 

I am not actually a beginner. I have worked out very irregularly the last 3 years. but I am not weak. 

No idea about bf%. I don;t know where to measure that. 
My TDEE with no excercise is 2100 and I eat 1600 a day. However I do work out 3 times a week. 

I appreciate you taking the time.  




 He is right. But what got me started was this because it is easy to start with and does not require any effort to get started. 

Some don't like bodyweightfitness but it is much better than doing nothing. 
http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1vupz1/rbodyweightfitness_it_has_taken_me_quite_a_while/ 




 go on... 




 so, this site tells me (depending on how much exercise I do, light or moderate) that I should eat 2400kcal (light exercise) or 2700kcal (moderate exercise) to maintain my weight. I am currently working out 3 times a week and trying to eat 1600kcal per day. Should I eat more than that to maintain my muscle?

edit: 174cm, 81.5kg, 30 years old male. 

and thank you btw.  




 Hey, thank you also for replying. I have also said this to somebody else. I would like to generally understand the workings of the body. I appreciate that some people are different. But I would like to know generally what eating at a deficit/surplus does to your body when you workout/don't workout.  




 Hey, thanks for replying. Basically, what I was aiming at was to gather knowledge. I just want to understand the principles of gaining/losing weight and gaining/losing muscle. 

But I am 174cm tall, weight 81.5kg am 30 years old and currently eat 1650 kcal a day. I am working out 3 times per week (bodyweightfitness) 




 Hello,

I have tried to ask this in /r/bodyweightfitness but had little luck. I think it might be interesting for many people so I am trying here one more time. 

Please could we collect information on what will happen in the following cases:

(Please assume the following just for the sake of an easy explanation: 2000kcal required for maintenance.)

Cases:

a) eating 1500kcal per day not working out

b) eating 1500kcal per day but working out (at least 3 times per week)

c) eating 2000kcal per day not working out

d) eating 2000kcal per day but working out (at least 3 times per week)

e) eating 2500kcal per day not working out

f) eating 2500kcal per day but working out (at least 3 times per week)

In all of these cases, what will happen to fat and muscle, will it increase, decrease or stay the same?

__

What I am assuming is this, but I think I might be wrong:

a) eating 1500kcal per day not working out

Amount of muscle: will decrease

Amount of fat: will decrease

b) eating 1500kcal per day but working out (at least 3 times per week)

Amount of muscle: will increase slightly

Amount of fat: will decrease

c) eating 2000kcal per day not working out

Amount of muscle: will decrease slightly

Amount of fat: will not change / increase slightly

d) eating 2000kcal per day but working out (at least 3 times per week)

Amount of muscle: will increase slightly

Amount of fat: will decrease slightly

e) eating 2500kcal per day not working out

Amount of muscle: will decrease slightly

Amount of fat: will increase

f) eating 2500kcal per day but working out (at least 3 times per week)

Amount of muscle: will increase

Amount of fat: will increase slightly

__

I would be really thankful if you guys could provide some information. Because at the moment I am not reaching my goals. I am eating -500kcal per day and doing bodyweightfitness 3 times a week . I am losing weight very slowly and hardly putting on any muscle. I am getting stronger though. However I would like to lose fat and gain muscle.

Many thanks in advance.

EDIT: 174cm, 81.5kg, 30yo male.  




 God, this sucks. 




 Why is that? 









 Free Internet porn.
For sure. Have you seen family guy? Even 1st would people who find out about it can't believe it at first

 Apparently it is a LINE feature. What a coincidence.  




 Oh, ok. What a twist 




 Sorry, does great not mean better than good anymore? 




 Ah, alright. My SO has a MOTO G and I saw that on her phone when she gets a message through LINE. I though it was a LINE feature. 

Thank you.  




 Did you drug your dog to post him on the internet? 




 That is not correct either. It's just that Japanese idealize it. In the Japanese culture there are a few things everybody wants to do and Paris (or Mt Saint Michel for example) is one of them. It is being portrayed in a way that is completely unrealistic and people kind of expect a Disney Land like experience. Also it is not like this applies to the majority of Japanese. I think it is just a few idiots with no sense of reality who fall for the unrealistic image of Paris.    




 Yes, I agree. When you go to Paris with a Parisian and he shows you places where its not horrifically expensive it is amazing. French food and wine is worth the trip alone and in the Summer people in Paris sit by the river and drink all day long like students.   




 It's BS. I have been many times and whilst it has it's downsides (dirty, rude, dangerous at night near train stations or in the outer areas) it is amazing. Paris is absolutely worth going to, you just need to know its not all sunshine and gummy bears.  




 Don't forget the unbelievably rude Parisians.  




 I have that phone. The battery is great but it's not really 2 days. Seriously  




 I've got the z3c. Can I also do that? UK? 




 Sorry, what is active display? 




 And to commute to work? 




 Just by it from the UK.  Clove.Co.uk 




 Guess what: The blue lights are the only reason I think they look like Tron.  




 Fair enough. I think you have a point. But Sheldon is annoying as fuck and not entertaining. 




 He just becomes more and more ignorant to the fact he's annoying and that everything he says is rude. He has no periods where he is normal at all anymore  




 I feel like he is not saying single normal sentence anymore. 









 Cool thanks you. I'll do that  




 Thank you. Any good alternative to City Mapper for London? It eats battery  




 A little better than mine. 

Personally I do not like blue flowers a lot, but the pictures are nice. 




 I have to admit that the focus is not good though. 









 I am surprised this doesn't get more love. I think it is awesome. Really nice colours! 




 This would be a good phone wallpaper. 




 Sweet.  




 I am jealous. I where is this?

Edit: God, I do not read. It says where it is in the title. Sorry.  




 You're in good company  




 Is my understanding correct, that all the stars I see around the galaxy are stars from the milky way that are between that Sombrero Galaxy and us? 




 You don't like that? Don't buy it. Jesus Christ 




 Get the HTC M7 then. Full HD 4.7" , premium material. Stil quick enough for all you want to do. I used to have that phone. I also love the sense UI. I only changed to the z3c because of the battery and camera. I don't regret my choice. 

But keep in mind that the HTC One M7 only has a 0.1" bigger screen, but it also has the back and home button separate. The z3c has them on the screen. That means you get a screen with is 0.1" smaller and is also occupied by the navigation button at the bottom.  




 So, I also had the HTC M7 which is amazing in terms of looks and feel. I now have the black z3c and I love it. The plastic rim is nothing like the one of the HTC One M7 mini. It will nevrev bother me. I am sure about that. It is a bit see through so it does not look like cheap plastic at all.  




 Why do you recommend turning the X reality off? 




 I used to run 20 minutes before every workout. But I was a bit knackered afterwards for the workout. Now I run on different days and do 30-40 minutes. I HATE running but I feel so good after continously doing it 




 He means doing push ups one day and dips on the next. That's what start bodyweight recommends. 




 So, just to make it clear (because I am not seeing much progress):

Go all the way down until you just hang there with a straight arm? 




 What? I paid 10 for a pair. Shit

Edit: [Proof](http://www.tmlewin.co.uk/Metal-Collar-Bones-6.5cm/505097552699,en_GB,pd.html?prefn1=categoryCIMS start=0 cgid=Mens-Shirt-Accessories prefv1=Collar%20Bones). But of course this pair comes with a nice bag.  









 I thought that before. That should work. 




 I wanted 4 years of my life on this shit. No more 




 Exactly  




 True, but for me that does not justify being a dick

Edit: actually I just thought about it. Not necessarily. If everybody else would not tolerate that one asshole there would be no problem. 
 




 I do understand that very well, thank you. You are saying that people won't behave the way I suggest because it would only benefit them if everyone else also behaved that way. However it seems more likely to people that even if they behave correctly, everyone else won't thus putting themselves at a disadvantage. Therefore, they also behave incorrectly.

However, somebody needs to do the first step and bite the bullet. However it seems to me you won't be the one. 




 I disagree. People have high expectations for EVERYTHING. The way they get talked to by waiters, how their boss should behave, how their children should respect them, how they deserve this and should not be treated in this way... the list is endless. 

And that's all fine, if they are willing to treat people in the same way in return.  




 No, just "give what you expect to get". 




 Says everybody who is not willing to do the first step. 




 Sounds interesting.  Might actually give it a try  




 Just tried a few times. It's pretty much instantly if you use the touch screen. The hardware button is much slower though.

Edit: just realised, instantly is not specific. I think honestly, you can press the camera button, focus and take the pic in a second  




 Haha, you dick.  :) 




 Not sure if you are asking if I have regrets. But if you are, then:

I always think that every wrong decision is fine as long as at the time I made it, it seemed like the right decision considering what I knew then. I don't regret these decisions. 

Every time I was warned and did it anyway, those are the moments I regret.  




 Sort it out maybe? 




 Everybody should stop fucking people over for money. 

The problem is that even though you are in a position where you can get rich by:

- using inferior ingredients in the food you sell
- charging too much for your shitting product
- spying on people and then selling the data
- bla 
- bla 
- bla

The same thing is happening to you all the time because there are others out there who do the same. If everybody stopped doing it we could all live better lives. 




 Please make my life better. 




 I feel like everybody could end up being mentioned in here. People always think everybody else is stupid.  




 So white! 




 Sorry, that's not what I meant. 




 Cool. I'll give it a shot.

Thanks 




 Sorry to hear that. Maybe I was lucky then, I honestly dropped it more than 10 times. 




 I agree with you 100%. 

A person who has made a mistake should always have a second chance (hopefully they learn from it). I also believe that this forgetting thing only works after a long time anyway. 

However a company should have to provide an address, just to make sure they are not doing any shady stuff. I mean if your apps are legit, then there is no problem with that anyway.  




 I totally understand that. But my fingers are too short for the big screen.  




 why have you got duplicates?
I don't understand.  




 I bought if for 350. The compact, but I don't think that is expensive for a good phone.  




 Z3 compact has a burst mode. You click once, it take about 20 pictures and you select the best one. I have only tried it without actually wanting to take a picture but seems to be working fine.  




 I had a HTC One M7, dropped it a million time. I few bends, but the phone does not break even without a case. I loved the phone, because of Sense. Best UI in my eyes. But the battery life was terrible. I now got a Z3 compact and I think I will love it. No case either. Battery seems good, but I don't see it as being as amazing as everybody says.  




 How do you know?  




 Cool thanks  




 It's BS. Use street view and you will see that a lot of the outer areas of "greater Tokyo" are just farmland. 

It is not a good comparison because there are no "rules" for calling an area greater XXX. If they wanted they could call the whole of South West England greater London. 

Edit: Just look at the marked area here. It is just hills and forest. Same with all North East of it.

What kind of stuff do you look for? 




 I feel like the brackets are UNNECESSARY

 I agree. What does it matter what it says on the spec sheet. If it looks good, I'm fine with it.  




 Yep, my HTC One M7 is dead by the time I get on the bus home.  




 Nah, unfortunately they are simply not big enough. 

For example [this one](http://38.media.tumblr.com/45ff3d004d94899ba4d9cd907b0f7d17/tumblr_nadyoe0ilY1rtbxrwo1_500.jpg) is awesome, but the res is 500x750. No chance unfortunately. I don't think all the pictures have the same resolution, but none are big enough. 

I love the pictures though.

 Haha! 




 Are you serious? There have been over 1000 fatalities so far. Survival rate is 10%. The whole of western Africa is about to collapse because of it.

 I just saw there is a transort tycoon, not OPenTTD. Just baught it. Will give it a shot
 




 Thanks. I'll give it a try.  




 Cool. Did not know. Thanks.  














 Is it me or is the resolution way too small to use the pictures as wallpapers? 




 I really think it is too tight at the bottom, no? 









 Ok. Did not realise that. Thanks for sharing  




 First of all: amazing work. It looks brilliant and I love the idea. 
Can I ask what you are planning to integrate apart from Fb (which I don't really read) and twitter (which I don't really use?). Are you going to I crude an RSS reader? Or reddit? If that would be the case I'd be super interested in using it. 

However I also think it would be better if it was an launcher with a dedicated home screen where I can add my widgets. 

Or maybe slide left to a screen where you can only add widgets which can also be scrolled down just like the app drawer? Then it would be everything I need.  




 You are right, but I think it's fair to assume that by hold he means use. Why would you just hold a phone? I can also hold a 10 inch tablet in one hand but that information is pretty useless...  




 So, just accept nothing is ever going to change?  




 Does make a difference though. I always thought "Why is everything so cheap in Amercia?" But it seems it isn't.

Thanks 




 Pretty sure that was the plan.  
























 Just came to see if anybody dared to say rape and if it was upvoted 

Edit: checked the top 5, it wasn't there, I was surprised  




 299 is a lot of money for what they offer, isn't it?

You can almost get a decent phone for that money  




 I don't seem to understand what that means. Is it

A) there will be a way to simply change to a different room provided by Sony or

B) I still have to unlock the bootloader to get this (and accept the drawbacks)

 









 If he is saying that he is proud of himself that he is making this step despite all the shit that people will give him, then ok, I agree.

If he is proud of being gay, I repeat, what is there to be proud of? 




 What is there to be proud of. I'm happy for them that they know what they want but there is nothing to be proud of. 

It's like saying I'm proud of liking the colour blue  









 I was at a lake he was swimming to a little island and back. On the way back he was struggling but at first I thought he was messing with hims SO. Then she started panicking. I jumped in a saved him. He almost caused us both to drown. 
After I got up asked if he was ok and walked away.  




 Let's say 10 years from now.  




 How is that? 




 It got cheap. for me that is perfect. I do not need anything apart from a seat on my flight. I just want to get there fast and cheap. 




 I agree with you. I think the problem is that:

- It easy for people to make music now. Access to instruments and digital instruments is cheap and everybody has a PC
- Publishing on the internet is easy 
- people are stupid

Conclusion is that there is a lot of shit music that is published and stupid people consume it which is why it is on the radio all day.

BUT, people with skill have been making better music every year. 




 America.

And the rest of the western world for that matter. America is just ahead. Rich are getting richer, poor are getting poorer and soon it won't be white masters and black slaves, but rich masters and poor slaves. 




 What does that even mean? 




 Since when is awesomeness not included in that equation? 




 Saved a boy's life and walked away without saying anything. I will always be that mysterious hero.  




 Not my original thought but: 

We should all be against it for one reason: The argument "somebody who's got nothing to hide has got nothing to fear" is BS because accepting that puts you in the position to have to explain yourself. The government should not be able to look at all your shit and ask: why, what, when? What if you haven't done anything but struggle to explain something that looks dodgy? 

The government should be the one having to explain why there is a good reason to investigate you. 

this is not about protecting us from terrorists, this is about protecting the normal people from the government.  









 Also, he does not explicitly say it but I feel he wants more money they more the song gets played but still wants the price for Spotify to be higher. 

The way I see it I either:

- Pay once and own it forever (higher amount)
- Pay regularly and get access (lower amount)

I simply will not pay for Spotify if it costs me $50 per month. 

I really dislike his article. Poor him for only earning 10 instead of 40 million.  




 How did you go about learning? I am interested 

Edit: just played and I am super frustrated. I find it too hard to casually play it  




 Good morning.

I am looking for a weather widget that shows pictures of my location. Like yahoo weather just as a widget.

Edit: nevermind. Apparently yahoo weather has widgets. I'm an idiot  




 Just remind me, what is the traditional way?  




 Works fine again. I am not sure how you are able to do it so quickly and hw you are even able to identify the problem but all I can say is thank you! Awesome work. 

I like your app! 




 Hey, first of all: thank you.

I updated and it worked fine. Great app. Now I updated again thought and I've got the same problem as before. 

BTW, what are the scores based on? 




 Maybe I am misunderstanding but there are loads.

Best one is

Linkme mangarock 




 Keeps crashing on my z3c. But I am more than interested. Do you know what the problem might be? 




 I don't actually know what the keyboard is but the new Sony z3 has an amazing keyboard. It is almost like SwiftKey, just better. Predictions seem better and the layout is nicer. Only thing I miss is the dedicated numbers row  




 Why is she not sweating?  




 Well, I do not. I'm pretty sure OP will be alright.  




 Does nobody care about the fact that somebody killed themselves?

Poor her must have had a shit life.  




 OP I think your edit is great. The best out of all of them. Great picture as well. 




 I used to think that religion is the biggest problem we have on earth. I used to think that Muslims hate Christians and vice versa.

However I have come to the conclusion that the problem is not religion at all. It is that a large percentage of people are greedy, aggressive and stupid. The majority of these people that make up the followers of Islam and Christianity are no Muslims or Christians, they are idiots. They do not follow the teachings of their religion in the slightest. The cherry pick the rules that they follow and do not give a shit about many of the rules that actually are not at all optional (stealing, murdering, drinking alcohol, having sex, eating certain things, the list is long). 

These people judge other bases on a set of rules that they in no way want to follow themselves and just turn a blind eye to their fellow "believers" and everybody just hops that nobody ever mentions that they are all a bunch of sinners. 

And it the same with non religious people. People say you should do this and that and should not do this and that, but when it comes to it people's beliefs go out the window pretty quickly. And all just because people are greedy. 

I hate humans more than I am able to say and I am sure what I have written does not even begin to explain what I feel. 

I will do my best to live what I preach.  




 Do you sometimes feel like you have got something intelligent to share and you wish people would just listen for you for 10 seconds and then maybe spend another 5 minutes to discuss what you have just said?

 Yeah, I don't like OP's argument. But this is a good enough counter argument  




 Let me know when you get an update. I am also interested.  




 I feel stupid for asking. What do you mean by that?  




 Understood. Will go with wordpress 




 Hey, I have decided to go with wordpress. But I'll still have a look at this.  




 Our host provide wordpress integration. We'll go for that. I will def lok through your guide. I am a beginner so if you want I'll give you feedback for your guide.  




 It's for my dad's business. Just as a place customers can come for information and contact. Nothing fancy. I'm gonna use wordpress now.  




 Hi,
I appreciate your offer. However we would like to try ourselves. The feedback I got here was really good. Thank you. 




 That is what I will do. Currently playing around with it. Thank you also for your feedback.  




 I am going for wordpress. Thank you for your feedback.  




 That is what I went for. Thank you! 




 Hey,

I had a webhoest before and we are kind of stuck with them for a year. However they offer wordpress integration so we'll use that now. Thank you. All of you helped me a lot.  




 Hey, I decided to go with wordpress. I am now in the process of building it. Thank you. I appreciate you took the time to answer.  




 Thank you for your feedback. Decided to go with wordpress.  




 So, just to give you some feedback. I have now changed to wordpress. it's easiest for me and my dad. As soon as I am done I'll send you the result if you are interested.

Thank you very much for your help.  




 It's called 3 ways:
It starts with a scene where a young guy sits in front of a gangster in his office. The guys says, you got three possibilities: Run, lie or do what I am asking you to do. if you don't do what I am asking you to do, I will kill your girlfriend. We will never find out what he did. Not flashbacks (flashbacks are for the prequel)
Then the movie shows all three possibilities at the same time and at the end you will find out which of the three turned out to be the one he should have chosen and which one he chose. 

the movie will constantly switch between the three.

Awesome, right? Anybody wants to buy the script? 




 I thought you meant how do I feel about using make up myself. Not sure if that is what you mean, but I will answer it anyway:

I don't mind if men wear it. From my point of view there is nothing gay about it, if men do it well. However, I can't even stand cream on my hands, so I will never do it, no matter if it is acceptable or not.  




 You don't know what you don't know. Listen to people with experience. They know what they don't know.

It took me a while to understand this.  




 It is the other way round, surely.  




 I dont like the way you write, but I agree with you.  




 Losing weight. Of course there are 100 different opinions how to achieve it, but so many people get it 100% wrong and expect so much in so little time and then give up because they are disappointed. 

I get so frustrated with these people, not because they don't achieve anything, but because they don't want to listen. 




 Most difficult and I am not there but somebody in my family is. Accepting that you will die, old or young. From what I can tell it makes you free.  




 I can't believe somebody else wrote this. I also commented not checking before. I have never cried so hard from a movie 




 God, I almost forgot about this one. It is a brilliant movie. Thank for refreshing my memory. Do you know any similar movies?

 is the Japanese way to end a request in a polite way.  




 Haha, did that must be BS.  




 Black people and chicken. Why do they not eat anything else? I mean I like chicken, but I also like salad, pork and cheese.  




 I guess it's because this is the way to be accepted in that kind of environment. 




 I love Eminem. 

But I really think that any movie, song, story that ends with waking up is just shit.  




 Please let me know your interpretation. 




 I asked a guy this exact question. He was standing in the street preaching. He opened his bible and showed me the first page and point at the first and second line of the first page. Obviously I asked him: Sorry, what do you mean? 

His answer: You have to ready between the lines. 




 "World peace and no more misery on earth if we all clap our hands on

Then We will have America clap on 5th April and the rest of the world thought it was going to be 4th May and everybody will wonder if it would have worked if we just had the same way to write our fucking dates.

 There are two kinds of people in this thread:

Those that opened this thread with the intention to write something funny/interesting and then gave up because they could not think of anything

Those that opened this thread with the intention to write something funny/interesting and did it.

I almost deleted this because it's boring as fuck but what I wrote above kept me from it. Don't want to be a quitter. 




 Hey, I talked to my dad yesterday. It looks like we will go with either squarespace or wordpress (probably wordpress). I really appreciate your help and explanations on this. This has been great. My dad is insisting that I find out more about how people will be able to find us on google. 

He wants us to be able to add some key words somewhere. In his opinion that is what search engines look for. However I keep telling him that a search engine (as soon as they get hold of your website) "read your website" and will show it in their results if the content of your website matches the search entry. May I ask what you say to this? 




 Same here. Love that one. 




 They are. I just called them. I am just not 100% sure. My dad trusts me with the whole thing. They only thing he keeps mentioning is: "How can we make sure people will find us on google?" 
Also, one last question. Will I have to pay extra for wordpress? Not a massive problem, just asking. 

Again guys, thank you so much. I honestly appreciate you taking your time.  




 I feel like I am going to go with this of wordpress right now.  




 Thank you I had a look at it and like it. Can I just ask: How do I transport whatever I do on squarespace to my domain? 

How about finding it on google afterwards? 




 Directly on wordpress, but that was just to get used to it. I actually just called the people from strato.de They said with what my dad bought, there is no wordpress available. They have their own wordpress type thing and I would need to change my package, which is possible without a problem. 

However they said the SEO option we now have included would then not be available. I have no idea if that is BS. 

I really would like to change to wordpress and not use their own tools because it stinks. Will it be difficult for people to find my website on google?

Sorry for these questions. It must be annoying as fuck... 




 Thank you very much for your reply. 
Actually I have tried to do it via wordpress (and I have already set up something that is good enough from my point if view). However I do not know how to transport it to where I have rented the space. I (my dad) rented the space on strato.de because his friend recommended it. Also, will it show that it is a wordpress website at the bottom? 




 Ok. Cool. I have already rented the space. I will give this a go. So basically they write the html code based on my selections? Is my understanding correct? 




 I did not downvote you. I appreciate your offer. But I would like to try myself first. How long would you need? 









 I don't like that. Thank you for replying.  




 No he really did not. 




 Why? 




 I am simply curious. You see it pretty much every day. Bus driver closes his/her doors, drivers for half an inch, sombody knocks on the door and wants to get on, bus driver refuses (and then of course sometimes that person loses it, but anyway). 

I do not actually have a problem with that because buses come every 2 minutes anyway where I live and I think the bus drivers get way too much shit for this. Clearly they are forced to do this. I was just wondering what the rules are the bus dirvers have to follow. Are they only allowed to open doors in the marked areas at bus stops? If so, why? What happens when they do open the door where there are not supposed to?

 




 Did not think about that, but it makes sense to me.  




 That is the thing it is not heavy at all and it is really good to hold in one hand. It is much easier to hold than a flat tablet. 

And honestly I do not think there is an problem with putting it between to books. It is still slimmer than a book and surely you can put a book between two books.  




 I own a Yoga 8 inch table and the hardware sucks and the UI also does. But I will never go for anything else because it is sooooo convenient. Stand work flawless, it is really comfortable to hold and the battery lasts very long. I can only recommend this tablet 




 No SD card slot is a deal breaker for any device. What the fuck?   




 First of all, I wasn't serious. But now that I think about it. For me the best game of all time is the game that I enjoyed most, so Call of Duty Black Ops is my all time favourite. There might be other games that I would have enjoyed more than this one, but out of the ones I have played this is the best.  




 Good fun playing 4 player zombies with my friends. Just good memories  




 Easy: Call of Duty Black Ops

 Garfield. The Halloween episode scare the shit out of me.  




 It's a technicality. For example: I am now going to put/not put your wallet on the table. 

* In case I do it and we leave it there, it will be there forever.

* In case I do not put it there and neither does anybody else, it will never be there. 

At any point in the future both things forever and never have the same duration. 

Does that make sense? 




 Is this really a thing? Can I "dress up" as a homeless guy and get away with spitting into peoples mouths?

Edit: I feel like it should be dress down, not dress up...

 Honestly, I have been looking for ages and by far the best looking shirts (IMO) are DKNY shirts. The good thing is moss.co.uk very often has them one sale. Sometimes I only pay 20 per shirt. They are simply amazing.  
























 Just asking, not making any assumptions:

Is this kind of shit (and the case in the top comment) only possible in America? I never hear shit like this happen in any other country. Of course mistakes are being made everywhere, and there are dickheads everywhere, but such a large scale fuckup does not seem to happen anywhere else but in America, the land of unlimited possibilities.  




 So, what was the end of the story?

 I am just wondering which of the movies (plus clone wars and rebels) people actually appreciate / don't appreciate. 

I guess just like me all fans are, above all, in love with the idea of star wars, the world and the story of jedi against sith and  the dark and bright side of the force. 




 Yeah, I would like that. 

Thanks! 




 My mother is crazy and has the radiator on the whole day even when she is at work. I am not like that at all, but I am wondering how I can make some good decisions to spend as little money as necessary and be comfortable throughout the winter. 

One question I would like to answer is: Is it better to keep a certain temperature in the house during the day or shall I turn everything off when I am not at home? 




 Really? I did not know that at this altitude you cant see the curvature. Can you link some pictures showing earth from about that height where you can hardly see curvature? 




 I thought you wanted to say that you'll get the phone, not that you get the joke 

I am glad I got your post before I started insulting you  




 You're writing that as if you are not permitted to use a windows phone and have to justify yourself. 

What happened to you? 




 I heard that before and it might be true of course. 

Personally I believe it's a way to maximise profits. I do not think R Do would be affected. Companies will innovate always to compete  




 Well, I would also be happy to.know.what it's called 




 Can somebody make that song from the video on the website into an mp3 file?

pretty pleeeeeze. 









 I will start by saying I am pro universal healthcare. 

You have pointed out the problem of the "old" system. Those who are poor or ill do not get / can't afford it. Universal healthcare makes sure that our society as a whole makes sure everybody is taken care of.

The benefits are that:
- Everybody is insured
- Even if you are an idiot and don't know what is important you still have health insurance (poor and rich)
- People are not bankrupted because they have to have expensive surgery (poor and rich)
- Price of treatment in general is much much much lower in countries with universal healthcare 

Yes the rich participate with a bigger share but they are rich so that can afford it. They also benefit from it and after paying their share they are still rich (it's not like it's making anybody poor). 




 What are they fighting over though. Life or death or whether the guy goes to heaven or hell? He looks pretty dead to me 




 my girlfriend has been diagnosed with cancer and there is only limited treatment. we basically had to accept that it can be controlled to a certain level but not cured. 

now she needs counselling but it seems nobody knows where to go. she has had some counselling but was told she is only entitled to 12 sessions in total. she will however need to regularly talk to somebody indefinitely to be able to control and understand her emotions. 

does anybody know where we could go?

any advice would be greatly appreciated.  




 What exactly does this do? 




 I was sure this was a piss take. I was very surprised

 The streets are full of vomit in London. If I was British I would find that embarrassing  




 I hope I'm not too late. I'd like to know what other people think. 

I deal with many European oil and gas manufacturers. Many of them Italian and British.

For some reason the British have such a low opinion of Italian and other southern European countries and always tell me I should not buy there and that nobody can compete with British manufacturers. 

Truth is, British manufacturers are slow, expensive, their customer service is bad, their manufacturing equipment old and their quality questionable at best. All they have left is a bright history and they seem to think that's a good enouh reason to buy from them.

Any chance you will wake up and acknowledge that mainland Europe is miles ahead of you? 




 I am scared to buy it because I don't want that book connected to my name. Can you just but it on the high street anywhere?  




 It still isn't expensive in the US. Come to Europe and fill up your tank. That feeling is horrible  




 I agree with your general view. But if sales are going down for the ipad means people stop buying them. If those people then buy an android applies a different question.

 I have used both platforms. I had an iPhone 4 for 2 years. I came over to android, found that everything I need is available and many paid iOS apps are free on the play store. 

Your Eurosport example does not convince me.  




 Would you mind being more specific?  




 The "R.I.P my inbox" is not at all obligatory.  




 Sorry, I am not suitable to answer that question then. Good luck.  




 Yes, I understand that, but most of them would call themselves Christians I assume.  




 That is what I believe too. I am not from the US but as far as I can tell, people there appreciate if somebody believes in god and basically is a good Christian. So I assumed that musicians do this to be accepted.  




 I agree with that, but I think it's fair to assume that most of these believe in the bible and Jesus Christ.  




 I mean it because many of the promote the fact that they are whores, gangsters, criminals, drinkers and so on. Does not really go hand in hand.   




 I guess Air Droid then. But you have to be connected to the same wifi.

 You can access your PC through your phone with Teamviewer. Not sure if this is what you want. It brilliant though.  




 Sorry, I have not been hating and I have not been cocksucking. I said two things:

- I think Android premium phones are better than iPhones. 

- I did not say iPhones are shit or not good. I just said that they are no. 2 on the list. 

I personally dislike that fact that people perceive the iPhone to be the best phone you can get because you can get something that is (in my personal opinion better) at least equal for a lot less money. 




 I never said that iPhones are no good. They are great, but I think Android phones are better which makes iPhones the contender. Everything I am saying. iPhones are perceived to be the best because of high profits and premium image but I personally think that from a quality, performance for money and usability perspective they are inferior.  




  but crippling them and putting the original victim and others out of work is just fucking stupid.

exactly. Like I said the rule should not be made with the intention of actually applying it. It shall prevent people from braking the law.  









 If you argue like this nothing will change. The intention of such a rule would not be to find offender and cripple them, but to prevent people from doing it. 

If a company then willingly pays less than MW, funk them and good night. This sort of thing does not "happen" it will be somebody's fault 




 What does that have to do with the quality of the phone? 




 Take the iPhone head on? The iPhone is the device that has to try and catch up with android devices. What are you talking about?

Edit: sorry, I checked with my mum and she agreed, iPhone is best. My bad  




 That's what seems to be happening to me... Sometimes it's really fast.

 I am just ever so slightly changing the question:

I went to a wedding. Saw an old friend of mine who I haven't seen in years (we call him James). I left the wedding early, because my girlfriend was unwell. 

The next day another friend of mine (Mike) asks me: Is that guy James your friend? I say yes. Mike then tells me that James told him (Mike) how he loved him and missed him and wished that they would spend more time together and nothing is the same anymore, bla bla bla. 

Turns out, James though Mike was me. And only because we both shave our heads.

True story 




 I am on three and it has been incredibly slow lately. I wonder if its them or my phone.  




 I clicked the diet link and read all of it. 

They mention "Old School new body", a workout. Is that any good? 




 Can I keep tax and insurance from Germany?  




 Ok, I feel like these are not popular at all, but from my point of view Lenovo tablets are unbeatable. 
I had the first gen ([this one](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Lenovo-8-inch-Tablet-Silver-Metal/dp/B00G459J5W)). I love it. It is not very fast and the Lenovo skin is not great, but I installed Nova launcher and then its fine. You get SD card support and the screen is fantastic in my opinion. For browsing and watching movies it is great because it has the stand. Battery life is incredible. 

Now they launched the new generation ([here](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Lenovo-YOGA-10-1-Tablet-Silver/dp/B00O636JFW/ref=sr_1_1?s=computers ie=UTF8 qid=1416244949 sr=1-1 keywords=yoga+tablet+2)). They both come in 10 inch and 8 inch. And the new generation also comes with Windows 8.1. I really think this is a great product. And the prices are really reasonable. 
 




 No matter if it is your teacher, parent, boss or arch enemy. We all hated someone and eventually became like them. What is your story? 




 I don't know why you are being downvoted. I agree with you. Even if you can disable them, I do not want them on my phone. I knew what I was buying and it's fine, but I really would like if I could just deleted what I don't want to have. 

I think it's a fair comment.  




 OK, wasnt so hard. Deleted the theme. 




 nope. 30 minutes. and 11 hours overall 




 Do you thinks that's ever going to happen?

Also Ahsoka's story... 




 Whom are you buying/making it for?
What are you buying/making? 




 Did you just get the phone or do a factory reset? I had that problem after a factory reset. The account was not linked correctly with the phone. After a new wipe it worked fine 




 my s3 has the problem that after 11 hours and only 30 min screen on time the battery is dead. 

looking at what used it up, it says 35% by cyanogenmod theme. 

how do I get that sorted? anybody had that problem?

Why illusion? You know why. 




 Why do you like / dislike what he does and what he stands for? 




 I did not realise. Thank you!

Where is this BTW? 




 I never get this. So for example 'Barack Obama sonic the hedgehog' or what?  




 Just awesome.

 Typical Eastern European move. They love that shit.  




 Please ELI5: 

When the ambient temperature is low, temporarily decreasing the temperature setting on a building's programmable thermostat (e.g. at night or when it is unoccupied) rather than maintaining a steady temperature can save a significant amount of energy.[304] A common myth is that if the building is allowed to cool, its furnace has to "work harder" to reheat it to a comfortable temperature, counteracting or even exceeding the energy saved while the temperature was allowed to drop. Actually this practice can result in energy savings of five to fifteen percent as the heat lost by a warm structure in a cold environment is proportional to the temperature difference between the inside and outside of the structure. 




 You know, the 3-4 thousand you get for 500000 plays doesn't sound too bad considering you record the song once and don't do anything after that. Nothing. Money just keeps coming in whilst you are at home eating cocopops. 

I would love that 




 yeah, why post something that says the opposite of what you're trying to prove? 




 Well, that doesn't count for me.too close to earth. Technically space, but I don't count that 




 I do not see one that is incorrect. I am not saying they are not, but would you mind pointing one out? 









 I can't remember the name of the show. Something from the 80s. 

A guy thought he won the lottery but turned out he only won 100$. he was super sad about it. However the weird, slightly dumb, guy in the show was super happy. When asked why he said:

Because I do not compare the 100$ to the 1000000$ you thought you won. I compare the 100$ to the 0$ we had before.  




 It is not uncool to know something.  




 This is so important. I love when people smile. It's the best and an honest non creepy smile is never inappropriate. Even at a funeral a smile can be consoling.  




 How to share. I never did and now I don't want to live with my SO... 




 I made the same experience. People don't even finish reading what you write. They read gun and an adjective and go nuts. 




 I am honestly just asking: Why do you add "literally"? 




 Haha, this is good.  




 My friends brother and I found out we started uni together in the same city. We started going there together in the morning and meet for lunch and stuff. Now we are so close everybody thinks we are gay. 

Edit: I feel like I left out the part about how we got close. Well... 




 Runny nose, no tissue 




 This is soo awesome. I bet she is super happy with it. 




 I just pray she is not giving it to the wrong people just filling their own pockets  




 I only ever played Halo 1, but fuck I love this so much. I can't begin to describe how this makes me feel. 

I'm gonna go home, show my GF and be disappointed because she won't care... 




 I went to a funeral, sat down and the old lady that was walking towards a seat in the middle of the row in front of me tripped and fell. Me and my friend looked at each other and had one of those moments in our minds:

Him: Dude, did you see that?!

Me: Yes, I did. What are we going to do?

Him: Please play it cool. If you as much as smirk, I will burst out laughing.

Me: Gotcha!

Looked to the front of the room for 1 hour not saying anything. 
 




 My colleague did a presentation in front of 150 people. He was really nervous but kind of managed not to completely screw it.

He was basically jumping from stone to stone, struggling not lose control (at the same time talking faster and faster) until he said one sentence that made no sense whatsoever. 

He stopped abruptly, looked down and sighed. It was really sad but unbelievably funny. 




 thank you. 




 Hey, thanks. I thought so. I have not seen it in real life, but on picture the phone loks super thick with the 4400 battery. 




 What is the oldest android phone that you can think of that still gets custom rom support nowadays and therefore still is a good purchase for people who like playing around? (e.g. S3)

EDIT: And doesn't have terrible battery life. 




 Which extended battery for the S3 can you recommend?  




 Can I used Xposed on non rooted phones? 




 He is not saying Europe should do that. Just that Russia is dependent on Europe more than vice versa. We should not be afraid of the cutting us off. They should be afraid  




 I would like to add a question.

Why are constructions sites abandoned during normal working hours even though the construction site is disrupting traffic and should be finished ASAP?  




 I would like to add a question.

Why are constructions sites abandoned during normal working hours even though the construction site is disrupting traffic and should be finished ASAP?  




 Actually, the case idea is good enough for me. Thanks  




 Thanks. I'll check  




 If possible I would like swipe my phone instead of my oyster card. is that possible today/in the future?  




 I agree with you. I also live in one of those shitty areas. Even though I like it anyway I am really looking forward to the improvements. However I don't think improvements always have to be the same shit. Cleaning up and improving infrastructure is great. Also some nice pubs are great. But I don't need shopping opportunities everywhere and I don't need all the chains everywhere. If I wanna go there I can take the bus to central. I like the independent restaurants and I don't need them to face tough competition. They don't seem to make loads of money anyway but I like their food and the facet that they are locals. 




 First of all, I love this every Saturday. 

I just discovered true dialer. Replaces your dialer app and I think it is perfect. I always struggled with dialer and contacts app, but this brings them together. 

Really like it.

Linkme: truedialer 
























 I love fantasy, like "Final Fantasy Advent Chrildren".

I do not really dig children's movies. They are better as cartoons I think.  




 So for your time on Earth you believe that is the only meaningful achievement? 

I struggle to find meaning in life and I wonder if having children would make me feel the same.  




 Lucky you. But you are also not looking forward to it, are you? 




 Sorry to be difficult. I just want to understand why you think that. 

I personally think it should be like this:

As an example:

at 8:00am the machine starts and you can see it because it has not yet left - here we all have the same understanding

at 8:01am you are still standing in the room, for you, 1 minute has passed. For the traveler (assuming he is traveling at 60x speed) 1 second has passed but still at 8:01am both of you are still in the room. 

at 9:00am it is still the same. 1 hour has gone by for you, for the traveler 1 minute went by, but both of you are still in the room. 

This is the case for every second of every minute of every hour. Both of you are always in the room at the same time. It is not like for the time traveler a "different universe is opening" and he is travelling through an alternative time. Same universe, same time, just at different speeds.

Please explain why I should not be able to see him?
 




 You do believe there is something (whatever it may be) after death though? 




 I am scared of dying. I wonder if religious people are too.  




 I also considered that point. However, I do not think it does though, because when he travels, the changes around him actually have an influence on the machine (it is moving backwards and forwards whilst he is travelling because something is happening to the ground, if I remember correctly).

What do you think? 




 I don't think it would because you are not stationary in time. You are also moving through time, as is the machine. The same way for the traveler everything outside the machine is moving fast, for other people the traveler should be moving slow.  




 As the machine is travelling to the future, it is still always in the same place. Therefore whoever is standing next to it should be able to see it because it is not instantly going to the new time, but just moving through time faster. The passenger should only appear to be moving slower depending on the speed the time machine is travelling at.  




 What's the surprise? They didn't know how much chocolate milk they were selling?  




 Nobody crops. Please tell people album covers are square.  




 Of course 




 Vielleicht sind die ja auch nur da um ihr Beileid zu bekunden. 




 That doesn't mean you can make such a stupid comparison. If you can't compare size because you don't know it, measure LTE browsing time for the S5 and compare that. 




 I didn't click that link first but after reading your comment I was curious. It's really funny. Why wouldn't I choose the facetime HD camera over shitting 2.1MP? 









 Do you not think they might be joking? They are probably bored and just say whatever to see how far they can take this shit  




 I agree with what you say. But seriously, and 14 year old girl talking like that clearly has no idea what she is talking about. She's just arrogant I think. 




 I am sure  




 He's going to resign soon I guess... 

Edit:...  going to be forced to...  




 How do you normally get there? 




 Could you be so kind and also answer these questions:

Why do we die without sleep? 

What else goes wrong if we don't sleep?

 Accuse them of rape. 




 I am sure it is something where I criticize  gun laws in America.  




 Colonel Jack O'Neill together with Daniel Jackson. 

I have learnt so much about compassion, ethics and leadership from them. I fucking love them 




 Not a movie, but Lost was so disappointing. 




 I wear socks, underwear and a t shirt with [this](http://www.threadless.com/imgs/products/1759/636x460design_01.jpg) on it. 

And I can bring a bottle of Japanese sake, a cup for the sake and Shiroi Koibito (Japanese biscuits). 

I would love to see myself standing in the corner of a party like this. 




 I don't want to have it, like regularly, but I really would like to have it once, just to know.

Do you mind trying to explain? 




 No thank you... 




 Integrity. The rarest thing on the planet 




 Reading all of this, I hope that my parents spend all their money while they are alive so me and my family never have to fight over anything. It's so not worth it. 




 is it the first time or is it not? 














 I do. I don't want to support this BS. Please give a fuck.

And I am also a business traveller. I also don't pay extra for priority boarding and all this crap  









 Pretty impressive. I wonder if the guy survived Auschwitz.  




 He is just saying that they did survive and that they took a calculated risk. I saw one of the guys in an interview. He said that cancer would most likely take longer to develop than he will live. That is why he went in. 









 I don't care whether you are right or wrong. Just please get your "their"s and "there"s right  




 Go to Germany. The degree is for free, teachers are respected, well paid and I know many who are very happy.

I swear, America is going down the drain and this is just one sad example  




 Hence my question. Do you have any examples that prove me wrong?  




 They just do. I think it's just a thing that never changed. You know, people grow up with them and get used to it.

In the UK they have separate taps for hot and cold. Socks, but it only changes very slowly.  




 I'm from Germany so I rely on newspapers to get information about the US. The Spiegel had an article explaining that the first high speed train is constantly being postponed because the republicans oppose it.

And at the end there was an additional comment claiming that the republicans oppose any form of government help to strengthen the infrastructure of the US. 

I hope you can understand.  









 Yeah I'm gonna buy one but will go for an all in one option. Aux in use and Bluetooth is less expensive than I thought. 

 




 Yes it does. Thank you. I guess I'll just get one with high ratings on amazon then  




 This would be perfect but I do not have a stereo with aux in. I currently have a tape deck...

Could use one of those fake tapes with a 3.5mm headphone jack. Haha

Anyway thank you. I would actually buy that if I already had the stereo  




 I use spotify and here maps. I was wondering if anybody can recommend a car stereo (single slot) that would be able to connect with my phone (in whatever way) so that I can hear music and directions over the speakers of my car.

If I would be able to change the song using the stereo rather than the phone, that would be really nice. 




 I want to ask a question but you might not like it. I'm gonna give it a go anyways.

I don't know you so I can't tell whether I like you as a person. But I can safely say that now you look really good, healthy and active. Before you looked, let's say different.

How do you feel about the difference in attention people are giving you? I'm gonna assume (again without knowing your personality) that before you did not get much attention, if any. I'm sure you loads now and compliments as well. 

I read lots about overweight people saying that they are invisible to other people. What is your experience? Now that people give you attention (again an assumption) do you feel they are superficial?

I don't want to forget to say "well done". It must have been incredibly tough but also rewarding.  




 So, this post is supposed to be a tool to make calculating food and drinks for parties easier. The purpose is to avoid having to think about it. If it does not do that, it's useless. 




 Do you never use a calculator?  




 All at the same time or what?

Edit: got it. Sorry  




 So then it's useless. If I have to think there is no value in this. 

I like to complain by the way...  




 That is a good explanation.  




 I know. I am surprised so many people seem to agree.  




 I did watch it. And it is good to know that. But I am more concerned about turbulence and the plane simply dropping down.  




 Just saw this today:

http://www.androidcentral.com/sony-roll-out-lollipop-xperia-z3-lineup-starting-next-month 




 Just saw that they now announced February. 




 So, that's sorted then. Next question? 




 Cool. Thanks 




 Analog pictures just look way cooler than digital ones.

Edit: The ones taken casually of course. 




 And that centre of mass would be your mum.

Boom! 




 If they do it better than all the others I don't mind the wait  




 I don't know why the guys answer as if no decent guy does that. I think I'm a decent guy but I do that. I think it's just because guys don't regularly need it and therefore don't understand that a girl's wants it.  




 Fuck as many women as you can. It's true.  




 Peel first? I want to get it right the first time. Thank you in advance  




 Have you got more information like this? I am super scared of flying and have to do it for my job all the time. You would really do me a favour.  




 I am assuming the gif stops there because the plane simply drops, right? 




 I can only say that I agree. I have not found a single app I like yet and the articles I can find online contain mostly to do lists and games (which I am both not interested in) 




 When can I expect 5.0 for z3 compact? Have they announced anything? 




 I can't believe how much the colour of the light sabre changes the feeling I get from the poster. 

* With the blue it feels like the Jedi are back in charge
* The green makes me feel like the empire is still in charge and the jedi are still rebels. 

I have got no explanation. 
Does anybody else feel the same?

 You are donating 10%?

I donate 18 per month and thought that was ok. 




 Surely not right now. They will wait for the beginning of the second half to see how it's going. Also who is there who could do a better job? 




 Same here. The feet looked disgusting before and now really clean and healthy.

I would be so happy about that 




 I don't think this answers the question. The grocery store could just lower the price then. People would find it more competitive and would buy more fruit etc.

But that doesn't happen. 




 I'm a German living in the UK and I always thought windows in the UK are smaller than in Germany. 

Also, double glazing seems to be special in the UK. In Germany we are now talking about quadruple glazing.

My point? I don't have one...  









 Really? They sound really nice...  NICHT 




 I'm just curious: when do they say it? I find it hard to imagine a situation in which it makes sense to say that. Or do they literally say it as soon as they find out you're German?  




 So important. 

Accused does not mean he/she actually did anything. It's the same with rape: If you are a rapist, go to hell. But if you are falsely accused of rape, then I really hope people will be reasonable and judge you based on facts and evidence.  




 Buy a Samsung phone and make sure to choose that whistling notification sound on max volume. Then start a text conversation on the bus during your morning commute.  




 Always say how shit and boring other people's weekends sound but never actually do anything yourself. 




 I am trying to explain it to my little brother because I think it is one of the most important things on earth. But I can't explain it easily.  




 Our products are sold into the oil and gas and chemical industry and we buy auxiliary equipment from UK suppliers (amongst others).

Their products are ok, but their performance is terrible. 




 Oil and gas and chemical industry. 




 Honestly, I work with exactly these companies. They are not top notch and their performance is way behind the rest of Europe. People always say that they are doing badly because the government is focusing on the city. From my point of view English manufacturing is dead because they use obsolete machines, their are lazy and they are arrogant  




 What are some easy and worth it measures? 




 Had to read that a few times  




 Either:

a) my German family and friends when they come to visit and want to bring something back.

b) I work for a Japanese company and we have got lots of people from Japan coming over all the time. They always want to bring some high value gift home for their wives.  




 People ask me all the time and I do not really know what to say apart from tweed jackets. 




 I had one when I was a child and I so sure my parents would have not spent 100 on a child's watch.

Now I see that they range from 100 -6000.

What did I miss? 




 I really like how you explained this. Very easily to understand  




 They have like 100 stores in London  




 I hate every single Starbucks because they are never clean. Nobody in there wipes the tables, floor, or cleans the toilet.

It's disgusting. I can't eat/drink something in a place so dirty 




 I wonder what they have been promised to do that.  




 The issue with their profits is not that they do not make any at all. They keep them low by paying a franchise fee to the starbucks mother ship in the Netherlands. That means the starbucks coffe shops make no profit, because they have to pay a high franchise fee. Therefor they do not pay any tax on their profit here. Star bucks in the Netherlands however makes huge profit but as far as I know the tax level is ridiculously low there (plus they employ several legal tricks to keep it low). 

In conclusion, they problem is that they are evading tax in a legal way. It is legal, but unethical. 









 I think people would buy their way on it though.  




 I always wonder if that is true. Is it true or are some people just better than others? Personally I believe the latter. 




 You really need to share some more information. 

Also, but that might only be me, I do not understand why it says 1 day and 10 hours on battery when you have charged about 10 times. 




 He fell asleep again, didn't he?

I want an answer to this question.  




 I have never considered that. Thank you.  




 Nope, all old ads. Thank you for trying. 
 




 Never say never 




 My auntie gave it to me for my birthday. It broke and I want it back really bad:

http://www.amazon.co.uk/Nike-Unisex-Lebron-Bracelet-WL0008-003/dp/B000813CLA

Where can I buy it? 









 That is what I sometimes think too. 

It is really sad. 




 Talking about ~~their~~ American foreign debt:

American foreign debt is in US Dollars, because it's the currency the entire world uses. If people would ask for their money back, America could just print money. It would fuck up the exchange rate but that would also make all the money people would get back worthless so nobody will ever start doing it. It would be a lose-lose situation.  
























 I would love that so much. 

I have found this where it is described as an issue that sometimes occurs. Not sure why people would not be happy about it.

 Unemployment, decrease in tax money and so on... 









 I'm sure I heard it was supposed to be available beginning if Feb 

Edit: sorry, made available by Sony. Of course carriers need some time  




 Why is he trying to sound smart? Im sure the 20 would have been enough as a nice gesture... 




 Well, its doesn't actually use up the 5.9 GB. It just downloads all the files that have to be replaced on your current OS. Then, after you have downloaded it, the files on your OS will be deleted and replaced by the new "updated" ones. This way the update initially needs 5.9GB to save to files that were downloaded, but afterwards, you only end of with however much code they added, which is probably not going to be anywhere near 5.9GB. 

But, yes, if you do not have the 5.9GB available on your phone at the time, do it like you said. If you do have the space available, it makes no difference. 




 Yes, it seems I was. I did not know there was a difference. 
Thanks 




 My question would be, why is it not mentioned in the bible. But I just thought about it. The bible is not written by god, so...
 




 I did not know about young earth boys having a different viewpoint to most creationists. Thank you for clarifying that. 




 But wouldn't it be worth mentioning? 




 The whole thread is a big assumption, no? 




 What if that civilization is older than the bible claims the universe is and they have proof (like books or whatever) ? 




 Well, their civilization could be older (with records of history) than creationists claim the universe is. That would surely be a problem.  














 Correct 




 Then my reply is Austria! 




 Pretty kool 




 It's not over till it's over.  




 I feel like sex adds nothing to the list. I don't think America is particularly open minded when it comes to sex.

 I did not know you could pirate android apps... 




 You know I like to believe that OP's car is on the left and that his neighbors, knowing how important it is for him to be at work on time, made sure he will not have to waste time on clearing his driveway.  




 Its a 12 day thing:

* Day 1 thread: post the name of a country you would like to see in the contest. Top 10 countries compete

* Day 2 - 11 threads: Each day there will be a thread for one of the top 10 countries. In that thread people can post their favourite songs from that country. Top comment will represent that country in the final stage.

* Day 12 thread: There will only be 10 comments in that thread, all the songs from the past 10 days. Top comment/song wins!

I think it would be fund and would give all of us the opportunity to listen to good songs from certain countries. 

I hope this will work. Of course the rules can be adjusted.  




 Sorry to ask. What's this? 




 I think your work is very very nice. However the quality of the pictures is def something you can improve. I think you would get better exposure if the pics were better. 




 Hey, I added links to my comment above. I hope that is ok for you and enough. 




 I think you can only be too independent in the sense that you don't share the important things with your partner, like going to parties together, sharing your thoughts and worries, talking about the future, etc. You know what I mean? When your partner is not the first person to talk to. I think as long as your partner is your best friend it should be alright.  




 Cool.  




 That price is not low enough! 




 A man of his word! 




 Plastic. 

It is causing damage to the environment and humans. 

Edit: Some articles to support my claim:

[Financial damage is about 13 billion per year cause by plastic waste] (http://www.unep.org/newscentre/default.aspx?DocumentID=2791 ArticleID=10903)

[Here is what happens to animals that mistake plastic for food](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAL9Xvrg3hI)

[Plastic releases a substance called Bisphenol A that is suspected to cause cancer](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/01/080130092108.htm)

 I agree maximum.

I cannot name any major conflict anywhere on the planet that is unrelated to religion.  




 Profit maximization. 

I can't see how this is going to be sustainable forever. The inequalities are already mind blowing and will only increase. 

But if none of those with wealth and power are willing to give it up, nothing will change, so I guess that nothing will change.  




 My SO has cancer. I'm listening 




 None of those will make you happy if you ask me. 

It's the same with men too. If you're looking for a longterm relationship you need somebody who is selfless, positive, independent, has their own friends and is not lazy. You can't live with a person who constantly complains, never does any work at home, is always sad when you do something by yourself and puts herself first no matter how funny or good looking she is. 

However if you have somebody who loves you, wants you to be happy, is going to do their fair share of work, lifts you up and let's you be yourself, she does not have to be beautiful of super funny but I guarantee you'll still be happy with her. 

Edit: If you're in it for the short term, then I agree with you 100% 




 Independence. 

Nothing makes we want to run away more than a girl who can't do shit for herself.  




 seriously, WHAT?! 




 I work for a company called "something something Industries". My colleague always says "Industry" instead and it drives me nuts.  




 Ads. 

I really don't want to be persuaded to buy shit I don't need.  




 Past Saturday. I was sitting with some friends, all of which are from different countries and we were sharing music from our respective countries. I played a song of a German singer who sings about his dead wife. My girlfriend is very ill and it made me cry.

Needless to say it was a bit awkward for everybody but I didn't care.  




 /u/nasebanaru pointed out that there is a wiki article stating how often Japan has apologised in the past. 

However in that same article there is a section "Controversy" which pretty much explains why this is not jet settled. This sums it up nicely:

Criticisms regarding the degree and formality of apology, issued as a statement or delivered person-to-person to the country addressed, and the perception by some that some apologies are later retracted or contradicted by statements or actions of Japan, among others.

[Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_war_apology_statements_issued_by_Japan) 




 Fair enough though. If you beat your wife, then apologise and then beat her again I think it is reasonable of her to say that your apology didn't mean shit.  




 Reveal a made up secret like: 

- I fucked your wife
- I am a Russian spy
- I am not your dad
- etc.

Then say "I'm joking"

And just before you die "or am I?" :) 




 I'm a German living in the UK. However the biggest culture shock was coming back to Germany. 

In the UK people say good morning, please and thank you. I am sure not everybody means it, but at least people do that and they try to be friendly. Germans do not care.  




 Fairness is not a thing. Humans invented that concept but nature does not care.  




 Fair enough 




 Im not arguing. From my point of view the Charlie Hebdo stuff (that I also don't find hilarious) at least has a deeper meaning. Those people are trying to influence their follow citizens. That 9/11 joke does not have a deeper meaning. 

This is how I see it.  




 No, not at all. What's the connection between a comic and a picture of a person who is about to die? 




 Personally I feel it is different, because that picture shows one person only who you know to have lost their life after the picture was taken.  




 So that is my problem? I do not *understand* this one? 




 You're right. Some people might find it funny. But let's face it, it's not a killer and therefore I find it unnecessary considering the context. 

I think really offensive jokes need to be really good or they just need to go away.  




 And my children will watch it too. For that exact reason. 

I believe Jack and Daniel together are perfect and need each other. As much as Daniel has perfect morals and ethics, he so often needed Jack to decide how to go about things. Because perfect morals only work in a perfect world. Jack was the realist who made sure to achieve the best, most ethical outcome considering the actual situation they were facing. He always understood Daniel and I believe always agreed with him. But he always pretended to disagreed with Daniel when he had to make difficult decisions. To Daniel it looked like Jack didn't understand but in fact he was protecting Daniel's unshakable faith in the good by taking the responsibility for the sacrifices they had to make. 

 




 So, I don't mind 9/11 jokes if they are good, but that one just isn't funny.  









 And what if that person then insists that they are crazy?  




 But then you've acknowledged it so you yourself are saying that you are crazy  




 I've got no excuse. I even checked for typos  









 Get a girlfriend and move in with her  




 A single man!

Every single time and it is so uplifting.  




 Who's the bald chick?

Edit: Got it

 Still dont get it 




 Anybody else?  




 What is the benefit then?  




 That would be a good reason  




 No need to torture me. Threaten to cut off my dick and I'll give you anything.  




 Why would they do that?  




 Tiny [swiss knife](http://swissarmyblogs.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Classic1.jpg).

I love the toothpick, and the scissors.  




 The fact that it starts with the word cool, but written with k instead of c. 

Kool, right? 




 LIAR! 




 So the benefit is that you can now install xposed, right?  




 Would anybody kindly tell me if I can safely root, back up DRM keys, unlock bootloader, install a custom rom and then, in case I don't like it reverse it all to stock rom with full functionality (and root)? 




 Are you a fatty OP? 









 I agree with you. In her defence, I would not risk my life if I was paid minimum wage.  




 Yes, disgusting. 




 I don't get this at all. 




 How did she get there? Why not replace the wheels if she's there anyway?  




 I think you have a point. They could sell based on benchmark results though, right? That would be comparable, right? 




 Thanks. That was helpful  




 I've asked this somewhere else. Why do they sell based on hertz then? That's like selling a car based on horsepower only.  




 So why do they agree to sell based on hertz? What's the point?  




 Brotherhood of the Wolf 




 Cool. Thank you!

Edit: BOOM! I did not expect them to be that pricey.  




 ELI3? 




 Well, I disagree. I am more likely to hire somebody who knows his weakness and will be mindful about it than somebody who thinks he is the boss and can't do any wrong. People like that are horrible to work with and don't want to learn. People who recognize they are not perfect and know where they need to improve are far better and will use more of their potential. 

Edit: Actually this attitude of yours is the reason people won't disclose their weaknesses. 




 Ok, you mean history synchronization? 

I meant stuff like your subreddit list and saved posts.  




 I live in England and I do not think so. Most still think they are amazing. 




 See, you English actually believe that stuff.  




 That is the way I would describe English people. You think everybody is inferior to you because of your past achievements.   




 Germany. Guns and the unwillingness to have any sort of open discussion about whether or not they should be abolished.  




 An accident. What the fuck?! 




 Fair enough.  




 People who answer the question: "What is your biggest weakness?" with :

"I am a perfectionist."

I think it is a sign of a lack of self reflection. I respect people who are able to identify their weaknesses and are willing to work on them. Being honest to yourself is a rare ability.  




 Can you point out a specific example? I am just curious what you are referring to. I personally believe Eastern cultures are just as bad. For example: 

Turkish and the Armenian genocide. 

Japanese and what they have done to Korean and Chinese women.

North Korea

Russian people seem to completely ignore what they are doing in Ukraine at the moment.  




 Post them on /r/StarWars 
They would love some of them. The Star Wars ones obviously... 




 Can I buy them somewhere? 




 I like this because you can share the to-do lists now. 




 Don't they all sync since they are based on your reddit account, which is saved online? 




 I am so weird. I have been using the free version for a long time now and had no problems. Just because you said you paid for it, I just went to the play store and paid for it. I blame you for the fact I will have to drink half a pint of beer less tonight. 









 would you mind uploading the raw file (if you have one)? 




 Exactly. Haven't seen that yet  




 Sales.

If you are buying shit full price you are an idiot. Well, to be honest it is good for me, but all these companies are undermining their credibility by always selling everything half price. How long have they been fucking me before when their competition was not fighting hard for every customer and they were forced to do crazy sales? Also, sale BEFORE Christmas? That didn't exist when I was a child.  




 Like this:

 But it's not actual help. they give out haircuts or let them have a nice day and then drop them back into the water.  




 What does that even mean? 




 Have you heard about adblock? 




 I think it is pretty clear, that the machine moves through time though because he experiences everything that happens.  




 I did not consider that. But then, at the beginning he travels so slowly, that light would have not been slowed down enough, not to reach my eye anymore.  




 Like I said, I don't know at all. And also like you said we'll probably not find out anytime soon. 

But yes, very interesting. Of course, with different timelines, I think your explanation is better than mine. I simply do not believe in (hope there are no different timelines. 




 What I am wondering is why the flag on his arm is the [wrong way round](http://advancescreenings.com/img/posters/a/american_sniper_t.jpg). 




 Well, I have no analysis. If that is how it works, then the movies is doing it right. I have no proof or argument. I understand your explanation and can understand what you mean. 

So in your mind he is travelling to a time that co-exists with the time you are remaining in, right? He is in the future, you are in the past but both of you exist at the same time, right?

In my mind, there is only "one time". Imagine it as a piece of string. 

--------------------A----------------B-------------------C--------------------

At any given point (A, B or C) in time everybody can be somewhere in space (3 dimensional space) e.g. London, Chicago, etc. Everybody can freely move in that space, but cannot move freely along the string. Everybody moves from A to B to C at the same speed, 1 minute per minute (if that makes sense). Now what the time machine allows the traveler to to is to:

a) travel backwards and forwards

b) travel at different speeds

However, whilst it is traveling through time, it does not travel through space (it remains in London). 

Now from my point of view, whenever two people are at the same point in time and space, they should be able to see each other. That means, when the traveler decides to travel from 8am on 1st Jan 1910 to 8am 1st Jan 1911 and we meet in London at that time, I will of course be able to see him, because we are at the same time at the same place. The only difference is that for me 1 year went by and for the traveler less time went by (however fast he was traveling). 

Now normally we assume that a time machine has to move fast to start the time travel (like in back to the future). When the Delorean starts his journey, he goes really fast before time travel starts. However he also moves in space which is why you cannot see him during time travel. You can only see him again, when he comes back to that same place that he has left from. 

But in The Time Machine the machine does not move in space whilst it is time traveling. I am sure you will agree with my example above where I said (*"That means, when the traveler decides to travel from 8am on 1st Jan 1910 to 8am 1st Jan 1911 and we meet in London at that time, I will of course be able to see him, because we are at the same time at the same place. The only difference is that for me 1 year went by and for the traveler less time went by (however fast he was traveling"*). But everything that traveling from 8am 1st Jan 1910 to 8am 1st Jan 1911 means is to travel from 8am 1st Jan 1910 to 8:00:01am to 8:0:02am to 8:00:03 am and so on, just faster than everybody else. So at each of these points you and the traveler are at the same place at the same time, just that he got there quicker than you. And being at the same place at the same time means, you can see each other.

This is as good as I can explain it.
