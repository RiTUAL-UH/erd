...Considered...

 Definitely let me know when and where I can buy this shirt at. Thanks. 





























 Well played 







































 Gotcha. Thanks :) 




 Yes, this is true. Although the US Constitution does supersede this and the Supreme Court would rule against it (most likely) as you pointed out, the states do have their rights too, just like how states can have legal medical marijuana although it is still illegal on a federal level.

Why shouldn't I believe that these states have these articles? They are written in text by the governments of the states and that is sufficient evidence for me. 




 Someone already posted a fixed version? 









 We're out here. 
























 I've done a game vs AI on the slowest time to make the timings perfect and 9 Overlord is the best. 




 If it's in the early game, make some extra queens. They have a good anti-air attack and can transfuse. This can also be used against ZvZ if they go mutas. Just make a couple spores around the mineral lines and spread creep between your bases. 2-3 queens per base should do it. If they are massing them, they should have very low defenses through the mid game, so a nice roach hydra infestor (with neural parasite) should work. Don't forget range and carapace upgrades!

 1. I hotkey; 1-All Hatches,, 2,3,4-Queens respectively,, Mouse 1-Units,, Mouse 2-Special units (Broodlords, infestors, ect...)
2. Initial scout I use drone, otherwise just run a couple lings in. With ZvP watch out for dark shrine, stargate, or mass zealots. Zerg only has an overseer and spores, I prefer overseer, so don't wait too long for lair upgrade. Also, if the Toss goes Vrays just make 2 extra queens and don't forget to connect bases with creep. With ZvZ scout early for an early pool. Other than that, ZvZ consists of making good engagements and mirroring what your opponent is doing.
3. Creep spread isn't too important, but if you want to add queens or hydras into your army, creep helps those units get into batter easier.
4. If you are going against a Toss that is FFE, then take your 3rd around 5-6 minutes if you see no aggression while scouting. Otherwise, I just take my third when I see that my 2nd is almost saturated.
5. Hydras are good units if they are used correctly. Common unit compositions are roach/hydra, and infestors can be added. A very strong mid-game if engagements are used correctly. They are DPS units so make sure they are behind your roaches, and don't forget the grooved spines upgrade which adds +1 range.
6. 2 fungals kill workers, but fungals do not do overlapping damage so make sure that the fungal is almost complete before a second is casted. I believe marines are 3 fungals, I would test it but I'm in class right now.
I realize that this response is kind of late, but I figured it might help out someone. 




 Get the surround. Have units on all sides of engagement. Quickly run lings to the outsides for a flank while the meat of your army (roach, infestor, etc..) attack from the front. The Protoss will have fun with those forcefields. Also a good strategy against colossus if you don't have corruptors yet. 
























 Try using the text wrapping "in front of text" that will allow you to place a picture anywhere without having everything moving around. Also, using "through" will allow you to move the picture anywhere without snapping and the text will move accordingly, if you are inserting a picture into a paper. 




 Another thing that could be wrong is that you need to update your graphics driver or install windows updates. Sometimes it's just an easy fix. Keep us updated please. 




 You sir, are one lucky person.

 Someone could be pulled over for another reason like a taillight out or license plate light out, like a lot of people are pulled over for, here in Washington.
