 Great question. A wallet with $500 hidden that well makes me think they were pot seeds from some righteous plant. I was more concerned with my sisters friends coming over  which is why I was hiding in the closet to being with... Nine-year-old me had some game.  




 'Draw' numbers one through ten represented by dots in a pattern and some simple math from there. Then breakfast burritos.  




 I found a wallet with $500 and a small envelope of seeds tucked in the frame of the inside of a closet (where the moulding would be). I was pretty young and showed my mom... real slick. The thought of how many WarHeads and candy cigars that could have bought kills me.

 Eh, kind of. I dropped out of college after my first year because my band got picked up by an independent label. Long story short, after some cool shows and a lot of fun, I ended up working nightshift in a factory. Went back to school and now work in a research lab, live with my SO, and come home to her and my dog each day. Not quite the rockstar life I thought I'd live, but honestly, I like this one better.  




 Yes, this is very common. It may be with a different professor eg. Anatomy and Physiology on Monday, wednesday and Friday at 9am with Dr. Green, 11 am with Dr Brown; OR on Tuesday and Thursday with Dr Yellow

 Walked into the house after a particularly long day at work to fresh baked Guinness stout chocolate cake (Yes, cake made with beer), Metallica slamming out of the stereo, an Allagash White, and a backrub.

 If you want fiction, George Orwell's 1984 is exactly what you described. If you're looking for more non fiction check out A Peoples History of the United States. 

Another interesting read would be the Republic of Plato which spends a lot of time on society and justice. 




 Think of the brain in terms of musicians. Each region of the brain has a set of different tasks that it performs and one that it is typically known to be 'responsible' for. In this sense the frontal cortex (The outer part of your brain just behind your forehead) controls your higher-thinking processes but is 'known' to be, generally, responsible for your personallity. The cerebellum, the little baseball-looking lobe at the lower backof your brain controls things like muscle memory and muscle tone, but is generally taught to be 'responsible' for fine motor coordination. 

Now, just like a lot of artists who have many songs (in the case of the brain - functions) the brain regions might have "one-hit-wonders" which are the functions that people usually remember. Name one song, without google, that MC Hammer did that was not 'Can't Touch This'. Most of us cant. That's how we end up saying that the occipital lobe (Back outer part of your brain behind that pointy part in the back of your skull) because known as the visual center. As with every one-hit-wonder some artist will write a cover song! There are many parts of the brain that are responsible for many tasks and there is a lot of overlap between them (There are 45 centers in the brain that play a role in vision) and can even 'rescue' the functions is others become damaged. 

The parts I mentioned above are more responsible for less vital functions. That is to say that if they became damaged you most likely would still survive but could become deaf, blind, develop cognitive defects, etc. You mentioned blood pumping and breathing. Well those are controled by the inner part of your brain, what's in the center and at the top of the spinal cord. Those parts control vital senses that are absolutely necessary for you to live. damaging that part usually results in death. 

Now the awesome and amazing part is that all of these things are happening all at once. If we're thinking about parts of brains as musicians who are playing their whole discography and their well known hits and some are covering songs written by others then we can think of the brain as SXSW. This orchestra of musicians all playing at once and working together is what allows us to run (Primary motor cortex, at the top of your head and cerabellum among others) and to read (occipital lobe, and frontal lobe among others).

Hope that helps! 




 The Limulus immune system is pretty simple. It's composed of the amebocyte, plasma, and a few proteins. To be honest, my largest body of knowledge is into their nervous system (primarily molecular and electrophysiological). But [this](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2873049/) abstract gives a decent overview. They're a pretty amazing creature. If nothing else, they pre-date dinosaurs and yet we can go to the beach and see them each spring/summer. 




 It stands that we (the royal we/academic community) dont know as much as we need to. Unfortunately there are not any real regulations against harvesting and bleeding crabs. Hopefully more new [research](http://www.biolbull.org/content/225/3/137.abstract) will bring this more to the public eye. Sadly, once the crabs are released back to the wild after they are bled, it is not unheard of for a crab to be re-collected by mistake and bled a second time, thus killing the crab. [Here](http://limulus.mx/lo-que-late-dentro-de-una-sangre-azul/?lang=en) is pretty cool article about how their blood 'works'.

 When you look at the stars you are seeing a collage of the past. You're seeing light from stars as they were thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions of years ago. Many of them may not even exist any more and yet we see them as they were. So when you look to the sky at night you are seeing many pasts during your present. 

Also - first post! I've been lurking for the right thread 
























 I work in an R D lab... You're right, it probably is the custodian performing an experiment and settling the over/under debate once and for all.  














 If you don't have one, make a duplicate of your car key. You'll want to let it run for a few minutes before you drive off in the morning. Nothing sucks more than locking your keys in the car at 5am when its -10. Also look for a place with off street parking if possible - this is key if you're moving to the Portland area.  During heavy storms all cars must be removed from street parking to clear the road for plows and it can be a major hassle to find a spot.  




 Not going to lie, I'll throw in some Austrian Death Machine for a laugh or two. But if we're talking about just sweet jams that put us in a good mood - I've been digging Vildhjartas Mastaaden album.  









 Howdy! Just curious - how do you all typically store your iaito after practice, specifically, the sageo? Does it differ from post dojo or post home practice? I'll usually wrap a neat loop around the midpoint of the saya with a slipknot as we wrap up at the dojo, but I'll do a cho musubi after home practice. The difference is mostly time. What do you all do and why?
 




 Last night was date night and I surprised the better half with a show in Portland. Vivid Motions production [Thug](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXF_rui1ZWM). It is a 'dance theater' that tells the all-too-real story of a kid in Portland who grows through death, abuse, and mental illness. It was absolutely stellar; If you're looking for something to do this weekend certainly check this out!

 New Hamshire is Shall-Issue to residents. Unless she filed for State residency I don't believe that they would have to issue one any way. I grew up in West Lebanon/Hanover NH (Where Dartmouth is) and it is surprising rough in certain parts; big heroin problem. A few years back some junky was calling for pizza deliveries and robbing the delivery drivers at gun point... on Dartmouth campus and throughout town.  




 Senior year of high school I asked my best friend to go to prom with me. She said 'yes' so I started making plans and when I told her what time I'd pick her up she was shocked. It turns out that she said "if my current date falls through, then yes"... I had two days to find a new date and successfully convinced my best friend that I'm an idiot. We didn't go to prom together, but, we've since been together for 8 years.

 I am sure someone can give you a better answer but anecdotally - you adjust. It felt very weird when I went from using the spare dojo iatio to my own. Everything felt very odd but I quickly adjusted. I would look at sizing charts and, as you said, const your sensei.

 Some what tangential but I was at an animal behavior seminar (I work for a veterinary diagnostics biotech company) and one of the presenters who studies wild dogs and wolves indicated that muzzle and face 'biting' among dogs is a symbol of affection. Pretty cool stuff to see especially during play. 




 No problem! It's a lot of fun and there are always things going on with the program as far as activities and events. Here is the site:

 Portland mentoring alliance through portland high school. You are matched with a student with whom you have similar interests and you spend time each week doing something you both enjoy. It can be hugely important to some of the kids and is a pretty fun program. Its a great way to help at risk kids keep out of trouble and to help other kids learn more about the world and get them through that awkward process of becoming an adult. They always need mentors, especially male mentors. 




 This. My SO and I play a game we call 'Left, Right, Straight' in which we drive/walk around town and pick random turns at each intersection. We've discovered a lot of awesome stuff about our city doing this. If you have GPS on your phone you've got nothing to worry about; just have fun. 




 Thanks! The leave it command sounds like it might be a huge help in this; I hadn't even thought about it for squirrels! 




 Thanks for all of the info! She certainly has a big personality. She does have the husky independence but that is overlayed by the  Basenjii stubbornness. There are days where she listens great and others where the only reason I know she hasn't gone deaf is her running to the sound of me making a peanut butter sandwich. If she doesn't want to do something she will protest the whole way.

I'm going to work on trying some of her commands in different environments, that's a pretty solid bit of insight! We do short leash her when we walk past a few certain houses and cherry trees but I want to try to break her from the habit of eating everything. I'm afraid she's going to swallow something dangerous that we might not have been able to spot in the grass some day. 

Thanks again! 




 She's got a pretty good drop it but she keeps going if it's something she can eat. I'll check out the links to see if there is a better way to deploy it than we currently are. Thanks!

As for the interactive toy - We tried that one. She likes to take things apart if it's possible. She burns through the 'indestructible' toys in no time. Any feeder toys that are as rugged as the 'black Kong' that you'd recommend? 




 Just discovered this sub. So far there is a lot of good information but so far I've yet to stumble across a thread with the answers I'm hoping to find. 

We adopted a 2yo Husky/Basenji/Border Collie mix this past March and she walks very well on a leash over all, but, often times she can be pretty difficult. She tries to eat everything on the ground; berries, trash, bugs, etc. We feed her a stable diet that our vet approves of (activity level and weight appropriate 2x a day at regular times) but it makes no difference. We've tried walking using small treats and redirection but that still didn't help. She does eat incredible quickly at breakfast and dinner and when we are putting food in her dish will do every trick she knows at once (It actually is as funny and endearing as it sounds). She loves to eat but we keep her at the target weight assigned by our vet.

Eventually we'd like to train her off leash but it's seeming that between her prey drive (She locks on to any squirrel or bird) and her focus on what might be edible on the ground suggest that it might not be a possibility in the near future. 

Any tips on how to get her to stop trying to eat the neighborhood trash? Bonus tips for working on prey drive (We currently make her sit, redirect her attention to us, and wait for her calm down when she locks on to a squirrel.)?

Thanks! 




 
* Fort Williams and the Portland headlight in Cape Elizabeth are pretty excellent if you like the cliff over the ocean feel.
* take a ferry from Commercial st to any of the islands or just ride one around the loop to see the coast and skyline
* Check out the cemetery on Stevens ave. I know it sounds a bit macabre but it truly is scenic and beautiful. All of the statues and monuments make it feel like walking through a museum and there is a small duck pond in the back. 
* Deering Oaks park has some nice scenery and usually some cool stuff going on. Bintliffs Cafe right off the park has the best brunch in the city IMO. There is also The Holy Donut right there which makes some of the best you'll ever have.
*   Riverton trolley park has trails through the woods that are literally impossible to get lost on and have cool stuff to look at like a river and a 'castle' wall. The Alligash Brewery is right across the street and will serve you with a free flight of their beers upon walking in.
* The back bay has a 3 mile trail loop as well as some benches and cool views of the city skyline. Not too far down the street is my favorite sandwich shop called The Local Press (woodford st) which is a must try. 
* if you're looking to get out of the cold and grab a drink or food check out Novare Res for over 500 beers and small but pretty impressive food plates (Crab Rangoon grilled cheese sandwiches are killer) or Sillys for a pretty cool menus and stellar shakes.

 I've recently started learning Toyama ryu (I practice MSR) to 'save my knees/legs' from over training. Toyama is a requirement for nidan testing in my organization so it is something I will need to learn anyway. My question is this - in the fourth form, Ushiro, there is a moment where both arms open and the chest is completely exposed. What is the purpose of this? My instructor believes it is to generate power or that it may possibly be to 'move bystanders' out of the way. Any insight? 




 One major contributing factor is what is called your chronotype. Tons of functions in our bodies are governed by cirvadian rythems which are ~24 hour cycles that influence the way many functions in your body work. An example of this is how you always seem to get hungry around the same time each day, or better for this thread, how you get jet lagged when you fly a few timezones away. You have a set of very specific proteins that, through a relay of 'signals' in your brain, adjust to light/dark cycles. These proteins interact to make a 'clock'. This clock has an output which could be anything from releasing certain hormones to make you sleepy to raising or lowering your body temperature. Now here is where chronotype comes in. Each "healthy" persons brain chemistry functions largely the same but with some differences - timing of protein and gene interactions are among them. Some people, no matter how regular and consistent their schedule or routine will always function better when they wake up late. Some earlier. It comes down to environment, life style, and genetics. Hope this helps!

 Here's the deal: I have been searching for an original (not the re-issue) Washburn HM-20V for over ten years and have been unsuccessful. I have scoured ebay but managed to either miss a decent auction or have not been willing to shell out $800 for a guitar with a broken head-stock and bent truss rod. I've given my phone number to all of the local and semi-local guitar shops and haunted message boards; I've searched Craigslist for most major US cities. A few years back when they were first released I picked up a BSG Customs M-20 (run of 50 HM-20V re-issues before the mass re-issue). I love everything about it. I played with a guy who had an 80's HM-5V and it wasn't half bad. 
Now my question is this. Has anyone played the HM-20V or even own one? Is my white whale worth the hunt, or are the odds so dismal I should just resign myself to not finding one?  




 Have you seen "The divide" if not I think you'd cry alone in the corner and contemplate what's worth living for. FTFY ;-) 
























 Probably not very helpful opinion but as you said, these are ahistorical. There is a reason these swords were invented for the movies... If you're looking to cut than I'd hugely recommend a more traditional Katana. The curvature of the blade, while an artifact of production, helps hugely with slicing. The major issue is that these are slicing weapons, not chopping. As such if you're looking for functionality I'd go with what's been historically tested and proven. Just my two cents. 




 The Arcadia National Bar is perfect for a bachelor party... Beer and arcade games. 




 It seems like something worthwhile to learn, even if you don't do it for practical reasons. It'll certainly increase understanding of the iaito (shinken, etc) if ntohing else 




 I'll certainly try adding another Seppa, I don't think there is that much play, but it's something I've been toying around with in my head for a while. What about using some thin copper sheet and cutting my own seppa? 




 Treat it with Beeswax... I see where this could certainly help, but would you mind going into more details as to why and how you do it?

Thanks! 




 so I purchased a [tozando toryumon classic iaito]( http://www.tozandoshop.com/Toryumon-Classic-FAST-SHIPPING-p/070-toryumon[fast].htm) about 6 months ago and so far its held up well enough but it has developed a bit of play in the tsuba and the samegawa/ito is shrinking or slipping. I would imagine with a lower end iaito this would be common. I do practice frequently but take excellent care of my equipment. this raises a couple of questions  - what are some common issues with iaito (or any gear like hakama, etc) that are treatable or even preventable. what do you do that other might not know about? 

E: [images of ito and samegawa wear]( http://imgur.com/N1MDaSK,H7vpooI) 




 Late to the party here but a couple of points:

- read up on [Miyamoto Musashi](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miyamoto_Musashi). He is a historical, and legendary, samurai. Musashi was most famous for writing Go Rin No Sho (the book of five rings) which was a book on tactics and swordsmanship. Find a decent translation and give it a read. But prior to writing it he was heralded as one of Japans greatest swordsmen... Ever. Among Hus feats was defeating a man named Kojiro who wielded an odachi. Musashi allegedly carved one of his own from a boat oar to win the duel. Also relevant to you is his development of a style called Hyoho niten ichi ryu. Niten ichi ryu is centered on using the katana and wakizashi together and simultaneously. Very unusual.

- As an iaido student believe me when i tell you this: one handed odachi is not the best choice. Super human strength (mentioned in other comments) will work  only in suspending belief but not to anyone with practical historical context. The katana and odachi both are slicing weapons, not chopping. Propper cutting is wildly difficult to do even with years of practice.  A factor to consider is that a good cur must come from using your core muscles and legs. This requires both arms to do well. Clearly this is not an absolute as musashi was able to make effective cuts with one hand but its wily atypical.

- short of trying some classes yourself check out some iaido and kenjutsu videos on YouTube. Any koryu videos will provide a good context of what good Japanese sword techniques should look like.

- at the end of the day its your book and write what you love. Two quick and awesome reads would be the book of five rings and the Hagakure. They'll give you a lot of historical context. Just make sure you find a martial translation rather than philosophical or business related. 




 Oh for sure! but what you don't want to do is take them unless you're I'll. Sugar and especially salt have so many field uses (sterilization, treating oral injuries, etc) that its useful to have raw. Also this mixture will replace sodium, chloride, and iodine ions you lose in sweat, urine, and stool as well as help supply glucose to your nervous system to combat dehydration. Its not to be used to combat illness but rather to rehydrate and make the infection less life threatening. 




 One huge thing you can add to an altoids kit is salt and sugar. Instead of using packets buy a pack of drinking straws (preferably multiple colors) and pinch one end with needle-nose plyers over a candle to crimp. Measure in 1 table spoon of salt. Crimp open end same as first. Repeat for sugar. This will create waterproof and compact storage. The W.H.O recommends treatment for diarrheal diseases and dehydration with a mixture of salt and sugar in clean water (where there is no access to medicine or medical attention. Eg refugee camps). I'm on mobile and don't remember the ratios but a quick Google search will pull that up.

 That book... just... I don't even know what to say about that one scene in the cave. You know the one. Only King could write that and not have Chris Hansen kick in his door with the Dateline crew. It's weird how he managed to turn that into a POSITIVE thing - I think that is what makes it one of the most horrifying books of all time. It can make the reader see something positive about something so fucked up no matter how uncomfortable you feel.

 This is excellent. I spent most of my undergrad in neurophysiology but was always somewhat interested in the behavioral side.

 Oh for certain. And that's a great point - its the classic "ninja" sword I was referring to; I could have spoken more clearly. I think that the sword in Japan has an incredible history and is an amazing feat of engineering (in its simple elegance rather than complexity). I just see the henain period and on as producing some of histories most incredible swords. The change in sword geometry calls for a change in cutting technique. As an iaido student I know how to cut as taught by my school and its lineage, that's an incredibly narrow part of the picture.

By all means go for what makes you happy and with what resonates with you - I'm just some dude on the internet :-)
