 My sisters 8th birthday. She invited over 20 people to come see a movie and have lunch. After a couple hours she started getting upset since no one had showed up. People had called to confirm the date but Mum and I told her we must have put the wrong dates on the invites and took her home. She never wanted birthday partys after that.

Edit: More words 
























 I have a cousins 21st dinner and can't order the usual water or juice without giving away the pregnancy. They know I wouldn't pass up a drink or two otherwise. 

I've seen lemon lime bitters served to children. But was recently informed they still contain alcohol. Should a glass or two with tea matter? or have you any other suggestions as to drinks that appear alcoholic but aren't? Haha. 
























 Thank you! I'll give it a try!  
























 Flushing the toilet at night. 
Everytime for as long as I can remember the sound has caused that kinda intense fear where all i want to do is scream and run but your frozen in place unable to make a sound.
