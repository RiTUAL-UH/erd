 A metric fuck ton of nope.  




 Awesome story. Very creepy and I am definitely looking forward to the update. My only complaint is when you said 'my brother and I'. Every time I read it my eyeball twitched. I can't be the only one.

 Got any weed on ya?
You'd be a lot cewler if you did.  





























 What's the story? 




 This is great. This needs to be a movie.  




 These comments are all focused on the animals. I'm sure she cares about the dog and cat more than any of us. They'll be straight. Dat update doe??!!!? 




 So I read your story then I read the other dudes story. Now I keep seeing oranges. There were two punk ass oranges in the street that I saw while driving home. There was a mark ass orange out front of my house. I'm going to throw away the jive ass oranges we have in the kitchen then I'm going to my moms.  




 WHATS IN THE BOX?!!!? 
























 Keeping your brain occupied.... Or Xanax  




 Where do you find this work of art?

 Double cream is in 2 creams or is it like a heavier cream?? Cuz I wanna do that to my next coffee.  




 Verbed the shit outa that bitch ass noun.  
























 It doesn't seem like there's a way out of this. What ever this thing is, it seems like it's in you already. I would say lie at your next interview but I don't think that would help. Keep us posted. Good luck OP.  




 Reaching a little there bud? 




 Yeah he's cute. Till he sets out to become the dragon ninja then all bets are off.

 Dude. I'd still smash the hot chick. Just give a fake name and don't let the bitch tie you down.  
























 Gavin? 




 We demand a shrubbery!! 




 You right you right. Took a bit to click but I can dig.  




 Dude.... Good luck op 




 You mentioned the hooves after the fact. The first time you brought up the moon lit carpet you didn't say anything about the hooves. Not saying this makes the story less believable but maybe a quick edit would make it easier to read. I had to back track when you mentioned the hooves to see if you said anything about them earlier and it kinda threw off the flow if only for a sec.
