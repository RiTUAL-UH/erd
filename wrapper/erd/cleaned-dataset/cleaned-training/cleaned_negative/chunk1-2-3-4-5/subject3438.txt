 Children of the Corn.

Actually pretty good, until everything got so super natural. 




 Moist. 




 Paths of Glory by Stanley Kubrick

Definitely one of his best films. 




 Their is no time in a black hole. 
























 It has always flabbergasted how people could be rude to waiters/waitresses...They have complete control over your food and you're first instinct is to be an asshole.

 After 5 years of having braces I'm still waiting for someone to say "Nice teeth".

The soundtrack really does it for me. 
























 Fry.
 




 Swing Away. 




 Moody's Point from the Amanda Show. 




 At least you will die rich.....
 
























 Anything captured on camera that makes your head turn

Love Murray and Hulce in it as well.
9.5/10 




 Any TV show, book, or movie you can think of.
 




 Hope....the thought that one day, life will be better. 




 A laptop with a built in printer.
