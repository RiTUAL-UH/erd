 I stand corrected, but your post is still a duplicate of

 President Obama exchanged emails with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton at her private address -- @clintonemail.com -- but did not know the details of her account or how she would comply with administration policy and federal records law, the White House said today.

White House says Obama unaware of the details of her personal email address and private server, nor how her team will comply with the Federal Records Act

 Just to be clear, you are saying that "x broken again" is unacceptable, yes?

it would be if it were the 10th iteration of the same bug in a short period of time, posted to /firefox for the 10th time,  yes. 

How would you feel if it were a PSA? "PSA: x broken again."

shrug, if it's a recurrence of an old bug in a new version of firefox then it would probably be worthwhile 

It's not how **I** feel, the community generally lets it's voice known on the quality of a post/comment in here :) 




 quick stats for ya, in the last 13 DAYS this sub has only attracted 25 posts that warranted removal, be it from spam, shadow-banned users, or manually-removed troll comments. From someone who moderates ~40 subreddits, that is OUTSTANDING. I've just enabled our traffic stats for the nerds

http://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/about/traffic/ 




  In this scenario, "x broken again" would be acceptable?

no, but on the other hand, we shouldn't denigrate less knowledgeable users who ask "x doesn't work, how can I fix it", even if the fix has been posted multiple times (let's face it, NOBODY uses reddit's search feature for such things, especially a n00b).  




  As far as I can see there are no posted rules in this subreddit.

because it's a small community of like-minded citizens,   we're happy to stay that way. I mod multiple subreddits, some are dedicated to growth, this isn't, it's a niche, mods   subscribers like it that way. I handle the small amount of spam that comes in here, antabaka is the genius responsible for the UI, it works, shrug.  














 we aim to please :) 









 if they break our rules report 'em   we'll delete 'em :) 


































  Windows 10 is free for everyone as far as I know.

  I know you. Chill out. You're not cancer. You're the backbone of reddit.

check's in the mail 




 You're actually alright.

thank you, contrary to Ransal's belief, we mods (in the main) just give up our time to help improve reddit in our own little way. These little dramas aren't even worthy of attention generally

 Maybe the janitor.

Capital J please :) I used to like to think so, now it's just a nickname/joke that has stuck 

http://i.imgur.com/lJmWQgW.png 




 you REALLY need to get a life :) 




  and no, you dont get browny points for not removing a comment that didnt break the rules in the first place. youre bad and stupid 

your eloquence is underwhelming 




  Maybe jumped the ban trigger too quickly but

not so, you're unaware of the back-story, the users' previous modmails in /wtf, /creepy   /gifs etc, this was in NO way jumping the gun. In fact (sigh, I generally don't even respond to these pathetic witch-hunts, but here we go), when he first disputed a post removal in /creepy (a post that was NOT removed), he sent me a PM, even though I had nothing to do with the issue at that point,   I looked into it   politely tried to help him out:

http://i.imgur.com/x0n8CiB.png

didn't work. Notice his insistence that I am actually a dummy account for admin, oh I wish :) And his refusal to believe his post in /creepy was NOT removed, despite multiple mods/screenshots being provided as proof. His paranoia   accusations that mods are liars, in a conspiracy to silence him   so on followed him from that point. I would never have even been involved in any of this if HE had not contacted ME 

 




 every time you try to demean me you lose, so much so you can't even reply to proof of your mistaken beliefs   acknowledge your error:

  Broken Link  




 the firefox addon "downloadhelper" works on that file 




  Broken Link  




 yeah I get that, it's just annoying multiple times daily :( Could the system not clear the "note" field for us when it sends that message, THEN we would be aware and would only have to click "ban" again? 




 either a revert, or, simply change what the mod sees when he clicks "ban". If the note needs to be removed, don't make the mod do it, simply remove it on the back-end   action the ban 




 mmm, I thought it sounded a fair exchange myself 




 http://i.imgur.com/IJwPfwI.png 




   looks like it does what you need. It may do silly things if you're using Removal Reasons for comments.

I'll look into it, cheers, I don't use reasons on comments, I use flairs. 

Edit: that script does nothing at all afaik 




 I'm no coder, just an end-user :) My workaround is 2 firefox profiles, 1 with modtools installed, for my initial daily logon, where the "y/n" removal is a BOON for prowling all my /new lists for violations,   the 2nd profile has toolbox installed, because toolbox handles auto-bans, "queue-tools"   so on much better than modtools (which is pretty broken). Sadly the 2 don't interact together peaceably, FF slows to a CRAWL if I install toolbox alongside modtools, hence the 2 profiles 




 very stupid idea...IF you are genuine you are opening your SO to all manner of trolling  abuse, rendering his new phone-number useless

  better install chrome before i kill myself then.

hahaha it's only a browser man, lighten up :) Iirc the problem is firefox reports you have the correct/latest flash but you don't. Grab a clean installer for flash from

http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/otherversions/

uninstall old version, install that latest version, done 




 there are known problems with flash installs in ff, search the subreddit

  Actually I was suggesting that upvotes be taken into account when banning people

problem with that is that it is easily rigged, clone accounts, sockpuppets etc, we've seen it all before, too many times. Here's a recent one I sent to admin

http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/2uouse/where_is_entrence_to_the_mario_bross_world/

http://i.imgur.com/zxWAabh.png


every commenter is a 1/0 clone account,   I believe the post got something like 15 or 35 upvotes in minutes, a clumsy attempt at vote-rigging
 




  I'm saying you ban people who post a lot of stuff that isn't upvoted.

that's ludicrous   untrue. No mod bans someone simply because they consistently get get downvoted. Keeping on-topic, mods ban people for promoting their own agenda. Nobody begrudges a REDDITOR asking the community to take a look at their site, but if your intent when creating a reddit account is to promote your own content you're a spammer, not a redditor. By the way, you fail the litmus test:

   If the only way to not be a spammer in these communities is posting shitlinks, maybe you are a spammer and should not be on reddit.

+1, this:

If over 10% of your submissions **and conversation** are your own site/content/affiliate links, you're almost certainly a spammer.

was a ludicrous addition to the FAQ? "And conversation", WTH is that supposed to mean? Feel free to submit 10 post from "myblog.com", it's OK because you have made 200 comments to counterbalance it ? Snort. 10:1 ratio ftw

 




 I rarely comment on these issues, been there done that, it's a no-win debate, but creech has it bang on here, I coincidentally advised a new user today:

http://i.imgur.com/DsGefXt.png

organic growth is the key,   a startup throwing itself against the firewall of subreddits like /r/funny is BOUND to fail. A whitelist is safer than a blacklist 




 I prefer turtles

 I think a 1-off is fine, good luck with the book :) 




 good luck :) 
























 First slap my wife has given me. 

Newly married huh :) ? 




 Hi Ralph 




 Hi Ralph 




 hi Ralph 




  Sound like you narrowed it down.Never skimp on the psu.What psu from amazon out of curiosity?

https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00ALK3QRS/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8 psc=1

I know the TX/HX line are said to be better, but that was about my budget limit (the PSU that popped was a super-cheap Winpower 750W that lasted 5 years+).  




  Did the computer just start actiing up,or did it act up from the get go with the new psu.Reason I ask is that the blown psu may have damaged the mobo.

That's my worry. The PC was fine, then the PSU blew up, so I ordered another, THEN it started randomly shutting-down/powering up only after fitting the new PSU. I've ran a full memtest86+ scan, the RAM passed, no errors. No HD errors, temperatures are all fine, benchmarked the video-card, checked Event Viewer, no problems. So I'm hoping it's a bad PSU (Amazon are sending me another tomorrow), but my big worry is something on the mobo or CPU is damaged. If I have the same reboot problem after a 2nd new PSU I guess it's time for a new mobo :( 




  .Do you have a multimeter.Google paperclip psu test.I wouldint continue using the psu untill tested properly.Do you have another psu to see what happens

No multimeter I'm afraid. And no, no spare PSU, this is a replacement for the unit that blew up (PC suddenly powered off, on restart there was a loud crack   a smell of smoke). I'll look up the paper-clip test, thanks :) 




 Edit: replacement PSU works fine (4 days uptime so far)

Win 7 64 Pro, Gigabyte  GA-EP43T-UD3L mobo, Corsair  CX750M modular PSU. 3 X SATA drives (1 is SSD), 1 SATA DVD burner. SIW/BIOS/SpeedFan shows the +12V line is outputting only 0.83-2.5V http://i.imgur.com/BSbIh6Y.png. Temperatures normal, all sockets reseated/checked.

  Regenerative braking takes the kinetic energy and turns it back into electricity which is stored in the battery by using the motor as a generator, instead of wasting it all as heat you get to recover some of the energy you've used

TIL, thank you so much :)

how could braking be regenerative (I'm genuinely curious/ignorant)?

  Hehe. How about: "Before posting, please read the Windows 10 FAQ

/u/whtsnk has expressed a legitimate concerned although outright banning such questions may be over the top. 

bans ain't gonna happen, downvote/ignore   move on

So, maybe a sticky? I believe sticky posts would appear at the top whether on desktop, mobile, even with CSS disabled, correct? 

Yes, it will appear for all users, mobile or desktop. ~~I'll see to that 1 in the AM~~, another mod can handle that 1, I'm off to play golf :)
 




  Then maybe (as you seem to be a wizard) it would be possible to implement a banner that appears when hovering the Submit button?

a banner saying what? And remember such a thing would not be visible to mobile users, or those who have subreddit CSS disabled. And tooltips are my coding limit, but our CSS guru /u/xvvhiteboy  can handle such things. What I CAN do is this:

  Actually it's already on the sidebar. /u/train_subject3554 was kind enough to add the Windows 10 FAQ to the sidebar as I suggested.

*Not long after I moved to Baltimore, my wifes car was stolen in front of our house, which then was just four or five blocks from North and Pennsylvania avenues, the epicenter of Mondays disturbance.  The police came and asked the usual questions before my wife piped up, What do you guys do to find stolen cars?

One of the cops responded that the cars usually turn up a few days later when the joyriders run out of gas. Then, without irony or, seemingly, malicious intent, he looked at us  a young black couple  and said: If we see a group of young black guys in a car, we pull them over.

 Gulaggh don't allow people to take their photo as they want to remain anonymous. In place of a band shot they offered up this drawing that one of their vocalists made in a psychotic state hours before he killed himself.

  Those trolls are a gathering of mentally unstable people with an obsession of hating Twit and Leo.

I love Leo, his work, his vocal skills, his longevity, but he proudly proclaims "I hide nothing, I want Google to know EVERYTHING about me",   so on, then comes all the issues you cited above. Really? Quelle surprise. As a mod of long-standing on reddit, with experience at Digg, NewsPond, Mixx blah blah I can honestly say you don't DEFEAT trolls, you deal with them. Closing down the online AI of TWiT is not "dealing" with anything, it's an admission of defeat,   that is a crying shame. Jeff Jarvis argues against such a stance on TWiG iirc. Odd thought, I'm listening to this week's Windows Weekly now,   Leo is referring to the chat room like nothing has happened? Am I missing something?

Edit: I'm not sure I see the correlation between shutting down live-streaming   trolls/bomb-threats etc? Why can't they live-stream without a live audience then? We'd still like to see what goes on behind-the-scenes/between-shows? 





























 TIL :)

 **was**, (  not because "so many of them rely on him to not totally fall apart", simply to allow me access to more spam), that exception was stripped from me at a later date 




  Englanders call them crisps or some shit.

[chips](http://fitchips.com.au/img/why-fc/chips.png) is what we Brits call French Fries, [crisps](http://www.artisserie.co.uk/media/859/crisps.jpg) are what we call the American chips 
























  Imo this is further indication that twit is morphing into something that -- long term --most core fans won't like. 

as a mod of nearly 40 subreddits here, I can say that if TWiT live-chat is brought to it's knees by "1 or 2 trolls" then someone needs to take a long look at their mods/methods. Hey, Uncle Leo, pay me! I mod /r/tnt, /r/iostoday   /r/twitaaa for you :) 




 Oh I don't know about that. They turn up with all their placards, ready to chant, and suddenly all they can see is white sheets, quite hilarious, imagining them on a knoll muttering amongst themselves 
























 Oh right, I never really look at that :)
