 But...Italy can't top...it's not right... 




 Downloaded it a couple hours ago and I love it!!  




 Are you only first discovering the awesome that is magic ocarina???? It's a smule app like magic piano but more mystical. 




 Dat tree 




 Accio. Most definitely. You can always use it to get yourself a tool to kill someone with anyways. 




 Hope you're okay with some Japanese songs;
Air Force Ones-nelly
Dancer in the Dark- Megurine Luka
After dark- Asian Kung fu generation
Alones- aqua timez
Awake and alive- skillet
Boom boom boom boom- vengaboys
Burn it down- linkin park
Byouteki kikkyu Nikki- uverworld
Caramelldansen-caramell
Cherry saki yuuki- an cafe 
Those are all I can get right now. Hope I helped!
 




 I invade people's personal space. Often.
 




 Autobots...they won't try to annihilate me. 




 I think all cable networks have a porn section. Only problem is you paid for this one.  




 All of the comments before me are so...technical (and probably correct). I was going to say photoshop and be done with it...now I have to learn... 




 Lost it at the monster mash.  









 Thanks! I've decided to just go ahead and jailbreak. There isn't that much to worry about I guess! 




 This isn't what I think of when I think of the Axis Powers...but it's more accurate than Hetalia...probably... 




 That was terrible XDD 




 Where was credit given to 9gag? The watermark? Then 9gag has written us a bibliography.  




 Reddit, have we really come to taking posts from 9gag? We're still bitching at them for doing the same thing to us.  














 The control of bamboo. Must be a lovely thing.  




 I can never get my arms to bend right so I always end up either in a strange position or using a pencil or something...

Well...I guess eyeballs could count. But it's probably not as satisfying as a ball scratch.  




 That they would. I'd find it surprising for any guy to agree with me.  




 Yep. 









 I actually read the whole thing...and about the pics. I think the preview is either legit or accurate. I wouldn't really want pics for the shit lasagna tub though. 




 The fact that my name is used in the same story as Comic Sans worries me.  




 It ran away from my computer. And it will never come back.  




 Kuroshitsuji. Just explain anime as sexy men that fight and it's also full of sexual innuendos.  




 On le front page! Congrats on both achievements! 




 Me and my friend actually had quite the debate about this. She kept saying green while I insisted black; the glass over the reflective part is green. The actual reflective part is black. What do you think reddit? 




 Harry Potter plot canyon:
Think back to Sorcerer's Stone. Remember how Hagrid got Harry from the house? 
Now think up to Deathly Hallows. Snape got Harry. 
I always found Harry Potter plot holes the most fun ^_^ ((I was actually hoping I would get to show off this 'discovery' on reddit. I'm not saying I'm the only one who noticed this though.)) 




 Go to the store and buy some of those cone facemasks (I've found a pack of four for $2). Put those on and tie something around your head. Go to every store in the vicinity. Occasionally just stand on the sidewalk. The looks from other people make this the most fun.  




 The kindergartners at an elementary school in my town (Well, two schools) all have iPads in the classrooms. When I was in kindergarten (not too long ago actually, about about nine years ago), we had blocks. Not legos. Blocks that would connect to each other up and down but you had to tape them together to make cars and such. Not iPads. Yet at my school we have two 6 year old Macs for all of us to share then a bunch of PCs. Kids need to start being kids again.  




 Want. Miko. Want.

 These are all of the Vocaloid songs on my iTunes. Some are covers, and I tried to remove any repeats. Sorry about the lack of links...it would take quite a while to link to all of these. I know there is a lot of Gakupo here...I love Gakupo and there wasn't enough of him! I'll gladly give you links to these if you would like though!

 And that ladies, is why tampons are the route to go.  




 I look back at memories from when I was a kid and since it was a while back, I can only remember a few things. Things I remember about my room are blue, my sisters room is red, and the kitchen is green. Outside is orange or white.  




 Cool! I never knew there was actually a name for it.  









 I must say, using reddit as advertisement was a wise choice.  




 Yes. All the time. I'm usually thinking about Hetalia or such though.  




 I got my mom a cake...well...I made it. 




 I would still recreationally sleep and eat.  




 ...Rammstein memes overload....XD 




 You...are...a...saint. 

Well, really I don't want to take notes to write a script tomorrow...and cleaning is too mainstream. 

But tis a valid point. I should indeed get off the internet.  




 Where was it??? GIVE ALL THE RAMMSTEIN RAGE ENCOUNTER UPVOTES!!!! 




 Yes...it was a guy that dresses like a woman. I *do* know the difference. 




 The leg sticking out is really bothering me... 




 There was a transvestite named Riley addicted to being an adult baby on my strange addiction...striking resemblance too... 




 Sometimes I do, but then I think of people's intelligence level and one of the most widely known products is a blanket with sleeves. Then I start to think that around 2010 we started going backwards... 




 Thanks! 




 "Wait...no...nevermind...we actually...and then...*insert contradiction here*...bro you just had to be there." my favorite.  




 The only students I tend to see on reddit are engineering students.  




 I think everyone needs to give this kid a cookie.  




 My teachers get all on my case along with the rest of the planet. When ever someone asks me "Why are you so quiet?" (I'm not really a quiet person...at all) I respond with "I really shouldn't plot murder out loud.  




 ...dafuq? _

That definitely belongs here...

Did my best! 




 Zelda on SNES....memories ^_^ 




 The blank spots in the packaging. They're irritating.  




 Can't...by the time I decide to get out of the shower, the water is freezing and I have to do gymnastics to rinse my hair... 




 Indeed. 




 You look a tad like Emma Watson. But these are awesome!! 




 Seen this comment on this video at least 5 times now XD 









 Well, those of us who can spell properly aren't exposed to search results that are spelled lyk d1s.  




 I would be in dire need of new trousers.  




 Just to correct....this is transformers animated. 


And my childhood is ruined. 




 I am not alone. When I was younger I always tried to put myself into a state of just consciousness.  




 Take a snuggie, phone/laptop, and snacks with for the poopy process. Much more relaxing.  




 Someone better take a cactus over there.... 









 Yes!!! Im always much better with a pen (or liquid pencil), good with a mechanical pencil, and pretty bad with just a pencil.  




 Le Jesus of bubbly beverages.  




 Well....smells is an easy one. You know that fresh 'snow just melted and no one has allergies yet' smell? Every time I smell that smell I think of elementary school and have a dire need to go on some monkey bars.  




 i find it silly i just gave it its 666th upvote ^_^ 




 Good to help the unknowing...with STDs.  




 one does not simply...create a rage comic. 


must study le art of rages. took me 3 months of viewing masterpieces to make my first rage.  




 psh...once youve seen blue waffles, youve seen it all 









 The Help. i figured it would be one of the worst movies ive ever seen considering my sister picked it ((shes the opposite of me...i prefer action/horror/blow up movies)) and the setting is quite a few years back. it was /actually/ pretty good.  














 XD Well...better not to lie! 




 actually, google is on the confirmed list of sites going down http://sopastrike.com/ 




 Indeed...especially when crash is involved *epic trollface* 


































 I only add people I know outside of reddit as mods. And if they have more than one account, they can use the account that is already moderating.  




 Boxers or briefs? 




 How exactly do you make a beacon?
 




 The seed is 'gnocci' and the mountains get good at x -285 y 106 z 407. 














 The first thing I noticed in the album was the Deathly Hallows graffiti.  









 Mules are sterile. 




 I decided I would update the software on my iPhone. No problem, right? Wrong. I look and it shows the 'connect to iTunes' logo. That's not right. Next, I saw a notification that my iPhone was in recovery mode and needed to be restored. I figured there was no other way to fix this since it was stuck on that screen, so I restored of course. I'm just hoping I'm not alone on this.  




 This made me cry! I'm getting the last issue...I don't care what it takes!! 




 I accidentally built a house at cloud-level...but only the 2nd floor is at cloud level. It's pretty irritating to go upstairs and then there is a giant cloud taking it's time going through my house.  




 FAKE. Nobody has that signal with At T. 




 Piranha.  




 87...A ton of these names decided to run away from my mind. Time for a marathon... 




 I would put my best skill at procrastinating, but if that's not accepted, then I guess I'll just make them all feel a bit too awkward.  




 This is fantastic! I'm glad nothing like this happens to me; I'm also glad you're alright (physically, anyways)! Message me when next part comes around!
 









 I've used this a couple times. You can change the angle and difficulty (how fast it 'scrolls'). It's pretty fun and the faster it moves, the better the workout.  




 I'm wondering if I should even bother updating or not...It seems there are more complaints about 6 than praise.  




 I know that (I actually prefer that subreddit), but my friend really wanted one Luka-centric. So I gave her her subreddit...and tried to explain it wouldn't grow that large.  




 Absolutely.  




 I didn't put it there, actually. My building skills are quite horrendous. And I was on creative and like to use glowstone instead of torches around my house.  









 At least he didn't click an NSFW links...from what we can see. 
 




 The fridge seems like a good deal until you realize that $100.00 buys about 3-4 bags of decent groceries.  



















 If they do take out all of the well known characters for 4, the movie will do as fantastic as the final seasons of G1. Once the characters people know and love are gone, they stop watching.  









 Back in 6th grade I had the pleasure of watching one of my classmates do an oral report after having vodka for lunch. It was hilarious. He never got in trouble. Just suspended for doing other stupid shit.  




 GET SOME HOT SAUCE ON THAT SHIT. 









 I was playing Minecraft and noticed the sun looked a bit odd. It was a solar eclipse! Has anyone else witnessed this? If so, how often does it happen? 




 I honestly found the Bount arc terrible. And I thought it was canon back then-so it was supposed to be awesome! 




 That's a dub I haven't heard in a long, long time. 
 




 The only person I am super picky about, is Kisuke MUST be played by Owen Wilson. 




 You have a problem with pictures of a dead fetus posted online yet you're on r/WTF?  




 Fake. 




 Honestly, you should try to stay around people as much as possible. With this, the last thing you should do is isolate yourself. That's when the bad stuff always happens; when people get the logic of "I'll stay alone to save others." If he is truly this crazy, you being out of the way wouldn't necessarily stop him.  



















 This belongs on facepalm (facebook post) and it shouldn't be here (it's a screenshot, check the rules). Also, I really don't get it... 




 Hetalia has mentions of WW2 and focuses on the Axis and Allies.  




 Well...I am quite the Hetalia fan. So, whilst I was in social studies, we were already getting rather off topic and in my corner of the room, we were talking about WW2. I decided to blurt out "I love the axis! Germany is lovely!" My teacher didn't appreciate that and I had to go through and explain Hetalia to a room of non-anime viewers. 




 What's the age range? 














 Austria. 




 I think this is pretty awesome for LP and Transformers fans like me...but I'll never get one.  




 It's a my little pony extension for google chrome (ponyhoof).  














 Bidding ended at about $250.00. Little less..But that tab makes scary sounds.  














 J-just take all of my upvotes!!! 




 how...did...you...FIND THIS??? I could hug attack right now!!! 



















 More like Italian.  




 My friend wants to be buried in a tomb of anime plushies...mostly Sasuke.  




 We all remember in the first movie when Hagrid went and got Harry from his house after the attack, right? Well, what about when in the last movie it was Snape to get Harry out of the house? This is definitely the biggest plothole I have seen in the series. Feel free to correct me, Potter fans, if I'm incorrect on something.  




 Break Stuff -Limp Bizkit. My I'm pissed off song.  




 Skillet is a Christian band.  




 Don't mean to brag or anything...but...crotch scratches are nice.  




 One does not simply...get sick of pasta.  




 I really didn't realize how many pics I went through until I was done! That was quite the adventure though! I didn't think it would look so nice towards the end after seeing everything torn apart. Well done! 




 Will you be a redditor when you're older? 









 My sister works in a salon and gets hair splinters in her feet all the time. 




 Considering how anti-9gag reddit is, at least crop out the logo to avoid ridicule.  









 We were talking about alliances and stuff...I got sent in the hall after laughing about Germany invading France...three times.  




 Boxers or briefs? 




 My brother in law has worked countless hours in factories for the past six years to support my sister, my niece, and now my newborn nephew, and my sister doesn't even give him a birthday card or say thank you. He's sacrificed everything down to his laptop (she kept hers though) to keep them out of the streets and she is asking for a new otter box. She also hasn't had a full time job in the whole time they've been together...spent the past six years on an assistant teacher degree that she dropped out on a month before she would have finally graduated.  




 World is mine hatsune miku 














 GerIta, USUK, Spamano 




 Psh...once you've seen blue waffles, you've seen it all. 









 It was probably the only time Italy ever followed orders from Germany!  




 A walkthrough had to be a mood killer XD.  




 He has to be a little impatient...Italy probably has no idea what he's doing! 




 That might just break the internet...in the most awesome way possible.  
























 I can't upvote this enough.  




 I don't have to listen to you and your anarchy. 




 I wouldn't mind...it might actually be interesting seeing how this happens. The biggest of my concerns is the flags. They might just change the meaning of 50 stars is they're lazy enough.  




 _ So happy! No more grown men arguing like little girls! 




 Maximum health. And a bad ass cape. 




 [All I can think of.](http://http://imgur.com/CBuA4)

((NSFW)) 




 Well, Obama's got reddit's vote. He did an AMA *and* is encouraging us [to exit our internet hidey holes] to vote! 




 We find out in another story...he was crushed by a giant shipment of oranges and ladies in white dresses. 
Edit: I accidentally a word. 




 It's not filler nor canon. It's an extra. That's all. Fillers are put in just the anime, yet manga extras can still be in there, just not part of the plot. Fillers can end up being more relevant than extras.  




 I learned that trick from reddit-thank you for saving me from trying to use it and leaving someone with a hot, soapy, shit soup in their toilet.  




 I just literally say 'etc' if I have to because I can never remember how to say it.  




 Sent an email...got one back quickly. I let the conversation escalate before I commented though.

*Not sure where I should go with this conversation now. *
 




 This is quite an awesome build. I downloaded the world to get a better look. It's fantastic! 




 I've woken up right before my alarm and in my sleep induced drunk, I started panicking, wondering if I downloaded the right texture pack the previous night so I could get dressed, and then proceeded to look for my laptop in the bathtub. I wish I had a good excuse for that.  




 YES! Glad he won! 




 Thanks! 




 This takes patience and skill that I simply do not have. I applaud you.  




 I'm not Hispanic, but I'm rather advanced in Spanish. When I read things out loud I use proper pronounciation and accent, but there's always that idiot that says "stop acting Mexican!". So I have to dumb it down to heavy r's and d's.  




 The hill I go snowboarding at has a conveyor lift listed on the bunny hill. It must be new this year, since last year there were only ropes. Is this an actual conveyor belt for snowboarding/skiing? 




 WE NEED UPDATES!!! Unless you're dead...then that would be crazy...or this just annihilated the ending. Or Rose hacked him. Fuck...now I'm overthinking nosleep. 




 My radio likes to turn on on its own. All it does is make loud, irritating, static. Usually I don't mind...sometimes I'm even too lazy to get up and turn it off. When it does this in the middle of Rose's dialogue, I can't help but throw things at it in fear.  




 I am a native speaker and I thought that was a saying.  




 Repost of something posted 12 days ago.  




 Marilyn Manson. Horrible live.  




 Well that's a lot of nope!  




 How much are they?  




 Thank you for living a dream for those of us who stay in internet caves.  




 The curl and Gilbird says it all.  




 If I didn't know any better I would say she was a Hetalia fan. 




 Fuck cleanliness too.  




 Ugh..that's going to take a while...I guess that's payback for derping up. Thanks! 




 I accidentally changed my spawnpoint...twice. The first time I tried the command, I thought it would take me to my spawnpoint. Since I didn't go anywhere, I tried it again thinking I entered it wrong. Turns out, I changed my spawn point twice. Is there any way I can reverse this? (I'm in a superflat and have been searching the Nether for my portal. Haven't had any luck with that..) 









 One of the features of the update says that Herobrine was removed. Is Mojang trolling us or was Herobrine actually there? 




 ^_^ 




 Then a membership is definitely something I'm willing to invest in. Thanks! 




 If you have an Underground membership, can you download all of the previous CDs/order them? (LP8 is the best!) 




 "Oh shit...didn't they do that thing with Jay-z?"
Or
"Faggots. Why do you listen to that screamy emo shit?"
OR 
"FUCK YEEEEEEEEEEAH!" 




 I like guys who are just a bit too socially awkward than expected...not necessarily the type to sit at a computer all day, but more of the kind that's almost too shy to say hi to random people. (And OP's quirk: awesome.) 




 The other one is Project Diva~ 




 Would love to...but, there's a bit of an ocean in the way. But a meetup would be awesome! 




 Same here over in Wisconsin...the snow cam is so uneventful. 














 I know Hatafutte Parade, Mein Gott, Absolutely Invincible British Gentleman, and Excuse me, I'm Sorry were performed, but I'm wondering if there were any others as well.  




 I always tell people my dreams if they're interesting; and I hate being a hypocrite. But when people tell me about how 'demonic' or 'dark' their dream was, I usually get irritated. The only thing more irritating is when my friend tells me she doesn't dream and when she does it's a sign that something bad will happen and she should stay home and watch TV that day. 




 Do you get your period on both? And if so, at the same time? 




 We broke another website...overloaded. 




 Not all of them are wrapped in the plastic. I've seen them at bookstores open; they expect everyone to be mature and buy it or pirate the ebook before reading it in public. 




 I was wondering that too....it just disappeared. Nothing with 20000+ points just disappears. 




 We have a bunch of those in our science classroom. They're not plugged in though... 




 Found it again! 









 Yet the textbooks at my school are falling apart... 




 You lucky lucky female you,  




 It was! I could fly across it at a point. I took out my compass trying to find my way back to my spawn point. It told me my spawn point was right next to the huge thing! So I was dumb enough to fall out of the world...no such luck. Maybe I'll be lucky enough to come across something like that again. There were even diamonds in the caves! 




 There's trees on top too-a whole biome! 














 If someone took my bike like that, I wouldn't even be mad. They obviously deserve it more than me.  









 Licorice. It seems the whole planet loves it, and thinks Twizzlers are the best candy in the world, but I just can't seem to see how it tastes so fantastic.  




 Thanks!
 




 Okay, this seems like a really dumb question, but I was wondering if Minecraft had to be updated for anvils to be available, since I can't craft them.  




 I have that printer...it sucks shit. Can't even print out a simple document without screwing up.  




 My friend can't remember anything. It annoys the living hell out of me when she can't remember plans or something but can remember anything science and math related. If I hadn't met her brother, I would think she was full of shit. Even though sometimes I do anyways... 




 "Rowling would not rule out another book set in Voldemort-ville. But as far as "Harry's story is concerned," Rowling said, "I'm done." This is the part of the article that makes me excited.  




 What is your favorite bath and body works scent? How often do you use calculators? 




 http://i.imgur.com/XosMF.png
Well this is a fine discovery.  




 Buy Lucky Charms (cereal).  




 Sometimes I'll be looking through a photo album and she just drifts across the page. It definitely livens things up!
 




 Pinkie's~ 




 Most certainly! 




 What's your favorite kind of chicken? (My friend's been wondering.) 









 That's Soundwave before he was copyrighted as such. 




 No problem!

 In science, some kid started to explain how retarded it was that we had to study paramecium. Someone decided to reply with "Don't say retarded you fucking fag!" 




 Most certainly! 




 I am honestly impressed with this website; It has tracks from extremely well known artists to artists from overseas. Even character songs! This is definitely going into my favorites~! 




 So...I guess we broke another website.  




 The bubble wrap bag things came with Vault. I was so excited when I saw the package! 




 Whelp, I'm done eating for life.  




 But they're still sending deaf students to a concert... 


































 We have to use the damn red ones with ovals. But I make circles anyways. 




 Good luck getting a scantron on an Algebra 2 test. No where to show your work. 




 So there is no HB #3 pencil?  




 Ultimate. I don't *really* know what I'm doing so I just stand in our goal and wait til my team throws it at me. Then I catch it. 
Thanks~ I really surprised myself with it! 




 I was thinking (instead of catching frisbees) about support. From others. I started to relate it to a bed of nails. Have you ever laid on one? It's painless (unless your hair gets caught!). Why? Because there are so many nails to rely on. Think of your supports, whether drawing, or a friend, or a sibling, destroying bubblewrap, painting, whatever those supports are that stop you from self harming at that moment, as the nails in the nail bed. It REALLY hurts to lay on just one nail alone, and if the bed of nails is just in the sky, you will fall without support. The more you have, the better and easier it is. I'm getting somewhere with this. And where I'm going is, find something. Some type of support for yourself. You can talk to someone, draw, sing, listen to music, or do something silly like wear as many shoes as possible then make noises, it doesn't matter! If it stops you from hurting yourself or others, do it! I'd like to find someone who went to the ER for drawing their cat as the Mona Lisa. 

* **TL;DR:** The more nails (supports) you have, the less it hurts.  




 1: I think they wear clothes underneath them, like a skirt or pants and a dress shirt. 
2: I've always thought they open in front, but then again it's right and left with robes and cloaks with me. 
3: I think the plain robes are a requirement for first years, as your crest and colors get added once you're sorted. 
4: Maybe the hoods attach? I think it might be the cloaks that have a hood.  




 I actually agree with this a ton. Harry was quite the asshole in the last book. Ron and Hermione were *constantly* trying to help and instead of contributing to the suggestions they gave him, he decided to do what he wanted and argued with them about why they were wrong. We get it Harry, you have no family. No need to start all of the angst so soon. Leave it in the fanfiction please. 




 I spent the past 15 or so trying to click on it.  




 Today I realized I missed the signups for ALL of the secret santas! 




 Other than that I've spent the past fifteen minutes trying to catch the snitch, I actually ended up seeing Dumbledore in a new light going for round two of the books. I was completely with Snape when he said Dumbledore had practically raised Harry like a pig for slaughter. I don't know if I didn't see it the first time because of all of that Dumbledore sparkle or what, but it took a second reading of the whole series and some movie watching to see how that worked. 









 This is an exquisite list. Shall definitely use some of these! 




 If the people that email your kids get an email notification that you receive a copy of the messages, she could have been fully aware of this, and secretly seeking adult help. Going incognito like this is one of the easier and quieter ways of screaming for help.  




 He's a bit of an ass about it, but for some people, the guilt trip works. If a celebrity went and made a video like this, the world would be all over it. Some people have a tough form of caring, and I think this guy has that. But it doesn't work to 'just stop'. Just stop smoking. Hell, just stop breathing. Forever. Not that easy, is it? 




 Thanks; I try not to listen to him. He's never been one to 'understand' what's going on with his kids until it directly affects him, and even then it's  more understanding that things aren't happy for him.  




 Craft stores. Dat smell.  




 Snape was an asshat to Harry because he was an asshat to everybody. It would be odd if suddenly Snape bowed down to the Gryffindor King. Snape's character is just pretty damn bitter towards life I guess, and I can see why. 




 I got it for free more as a "if I like this shit I'll buy the game" type of thing. I don't want to spend $25 on a game I don't like or  is only mildly interesting. I'm too lazy to print it too. 




 That's my plan. 




 I've been told that by my dad when I tried to tell my parents I was depressed. All I got out of it was that I was a 'self centered attention seeking fuck'. It definitely doesn't help the situation.  




 A blood bomb is when you period decides to do a surprise attack and BAM. Red hurricane. 




 Personally, I don't like how everything that was easily accessible in the sidebar previously is now moved to an almost hidden location. 




 I'll give them a try! I've been trying to read more than just posts on the internet anyways~
 




 It is well written, I just can't get into it; it's not my genre. I prefer science-fiction and action. 




 18-20. This won't be a fun night. 




 Study for a math test, a TON of worksheets, 3 chapters of To Kill A Mockingbird, a worksheet on Stalin, and a lab report. Yay. On the bright side, I've still got twelve hours or so.  




 I've started studying and ended up drawing all over a page of my textbook-luckily it was in pencil.  




 This was wonderful. I may not be able to relate to the bloody chair, but blood bombs, most definitely. And the worst is when they happen on the ONE day you don't wear a liner.  




 Only protection I have is Atheism. But all these religious people in my house are going to screw me over some how.  




 My bathroom has one on every wall. So in order to turn on the light you see at least 3. Fuck.
 




 Now...how in the hell do I tell more people than there are in r/nosleep?
GONEWILD. 




 Davey. Wavey. He is an expert in all things gay-yes. Eyes is the best way. OOR you could stalk them. I find that a fun method~ 




 I had a [horrible] friend that was homeschooled. She entered public school in 7th grade. Bad move. Her social skills were HORRIBLE. As in, she had her own cell phone, but left it at home (which was across the street from school) so she would use one of our cell phones. I'm fine letting my friends use my phone if their's is dead, they don't have one, or they forgot it that day. But she does it intentionally. She also had a bad habit of being...stuck up? Nosy? Acted like she was better and knew more because she skipped a grade. Not to mention, all of the times I have invited her over, she never slept over. Once she had a mattress to herself, a lamp on, all the pillows and blankets necessary, and then insisted on turning a fan on (in October!). Two of us were already sharing a mattress and one was on a pile of blankets, so we were ticked. Then she left at about 11 to which we were all happy. Sorry if this seemed more like a rant, and I could go on, but from my experiences, many of the homeschool (even private school) students I've met have not been pleasant. I have met a total of one homeschool student that was nice, but she also has been in sports, therefore, interacting. 




 4. Feelin awesome. This test knows what it's doing. 




 I actually have a black one of these. It's fun to walk around town with my phone stuffed in my pocket and talking on this.  









 Emma changed the most. 




 Slamming it shut is another great solution. 




 I believe it! I'm not grossed out easily, but sometimes the smell of what we're working with is just horrid.  




 My sister announces her shit status to her boyfriend rather openly. They have been together for well over a year so I think things are going well.  




 I don't know if it's the brush or what, but the last one looks awesome. Glad you found a good outlet! 




 The hour before lunch is always the longest. And I have Biology before lunch, so if we do a particularly gross lab that day, appetite gone until *right* after lunch. 




 GRELL! Would not have minded for a second had Grell sat on me~ 




 [This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS1uDnIPTvo) Is always fucking hilarious. 




 I don't recite the Pledge. I can't remember the last time I did. I don't like pledging my 'allegiance' to a country that I'll probably end up moving out of when I'm older. When we analyzed the Pledge in US History, I realized that it's a bit odd to be having kindergartners learning that.  




 Thank you~ 




 Thanks~! I do love Transformers~ 




 I like the new logo...wish I'd hovered over it earlier! 




 What I love about it is thinking of what you could do in a Cyberpunk society. It's so much more fun.  




 No problem~! I can't keep these awesome pictures to myself when I find them! 




 The download button on DA gives the highest resolution available.  




 What is the point of going to one of these events? 









 I'm in high school taking Principles of Engineering (Project Lead The Way) and the big semester project that we're doing is an interview of an engineer in the field. I don't know any engineers personally, so if anyone is willing to help, that would be awesome! There aren't too many questions, just about engineering. All of them are on the sheet (pictures). Anyone who volunteers, no personal information will be shared (except my teacher of course)!

 My school has a GSA, and I know a few LGBTeens, but they're friends so it's a bit lonely for me too. Just gonna have to wait things out! (Too bad we can't start our own LGBT colony!) 




 Okay, thanks! 




 How does this 'everything free' work? I don't see anything about it on the site. Am I lost? 




 What if the straps were to snap? 




 Grazie! 




 Know what else is weird? Bible fanfiction. I'm not so much shocked that it exists as that there's so much of it... 




 You're not alone. I might be a bit more skilled if it actually snowed soon... 




 I think I'll just stick to bitching at people with words...to stay on the safe side. 




 Thanks! And I'm good with any gender~ 




 Thanks~! 









 And people say Reddit is a waste of time.. 




 I'm American and didn't realize how much I loved Twinkies until I had a meltdown at in the store at the empty shelf with the announcement taped on.  




 Sup. 









 I've been sick with that cold/flu mutant too, and I know those feels. But I've been at home...thank you for brightening my day though~ 




 If this has turned into a game, then yes. I am in as well. 




 I remember watching the first movie with fascination with my mom. My friend and I went to the theater to watch the last one and it took every atom in my body not to let the feels out.  




 Oh...SuFin is so sweet! It's good to know I'm not the only Hetalian here! And this comic is awesome even to people who don't know anything about Hetalia...has an awesome message.  




 That's okay. I accidentally smacked my friend's kitten in the face. I tend to talk with my hands a bit. It cuddled in forgiveness though~
 




 You copied and pasted every single one? Thank you for saving me (and the rest of us) the time and frustration. Too bad they went so fast though.  




 I love this theory...but sadly, it cannot be.  




 You sir, deserve a trophy. 




 XD Hitler vagina! I can sadly relate to a TON of these. As do most females. Now we get to see how many admit it. This is what happens when women get their own thread... 




 I keep  HUGE supply of tampons and liners in my backpack and sometimes a random girl (or one I hate) will ask me for one in the locker room. I've got plenty to share and I know that feel.  




 I thought of that position too.. 














 Ching Chime-Serj Tankian 




 You may want to block your name out of the corner.  




 A local Sendiks. They were going on about Leroy Butler burgers and such for the year anniversary.  




 Yes, they are quite good burgers. But I was still shocked that she stood in line for an hour when she could have made them probably better in less time. I then realized just how American my parents were when my dad proceeded to explain how they're related to football. 




 The only thing I can think of when I hear Special K is Disco Bloodbath.  
























 Cheez-its and Mountain Dew is a favorite. Oreos are also fantastic. 




 Flexing is not a turn on. I'm sorry. 
What is nice, is a randomly clean counter or something. You can flex your muscles all you want whilst wiping down that beer you just spilled instead of throwing a towel on it. 




 Puberty roulette master. 




 Dem eyes. 









 It's not the *worst*, but I know life's just not as easy for ugly people. I'd hate to have to see my kids deal with a ton of bullying and rejection because of a few bad genetics. 




 Wait...is NotaMethAddict Kyle or Thorian1990 Kyle? 




 I'm terrified to have children because of that. I'm not the worst looking person on the planet, and I probably won't end up with someone less than decent looking, but knowing my luck there will be that one gene from that one ancestor that fucks it all up.  




 It's an edited picture for a show where the countries are personified. In the show, they have glasses. America's are named Texas. 




 HETALIA. Gay nations everywhere. I hope I beat someone to pointing out this CanAme. 




 Futurama and MLP? *highfive!* Working on one now~ 




 Oh! I must be on the right track-I've worked with the Greybeards. 




 There's a big quest besides all of the Dragonborn stuff? I just got the game and went straight onto Dragonborn quests. It was escape being executed, Riverwood, Whiterun, YOU'RE A DRAGONBORN. I'm level 10 thinking the Dragonborn quests are the main ones.  




 I didn't like boys at all for a while (thank you Spy Kids). But then I saw Shark Boy and Lava Girl. Bi forever. So elementary school for me...and my first crush was a girl. But then some boys. I didn't know there was a 'right' and 'wrong' way to do it. Just liking people. 




 He got reddit gold. I'd consider that a very good thing. 




 Congrats! Your stories are absolutely amazing, I actually want to read them more than once-they never lose the effect! 




 Fuck. 




 I often feel the same way. One second I'm "OMG MEN" but then I just find it difficult to see myself in a relationship with a guy. I guess I just confuse myself a TON. 




 So cons I guess. It would take work to drag her out of the friend zone. 




 RP 




 Thanks! 




 This movie always puts me in a fantastic mood. And in the mood to get things done. 




 Both girls...so friend zone is okay. 




 [I'm not that bad.](http://i.imgur.com/jSfjA.png) 




 Yup! I love Pinkie Pie because she is just that awesome and always hunky dory.  




 Thanks! 




 We would wrap it around the playground a few times! 




 My mom picked some up for me and I'm just wondering if anyone has used it and if so, how do I use it? The packaging for Swix is never too descriptive. 




 My friends and I have sat all day and used tons of yarn to make these things yards long.  




 I want gold for Christmas...
And it did continue to you! But skipped him. 




 My mom was so proud she found it. I had a mental breakdown over the loss of Twinkies. 




 Yup! I got my xbox today so I hardly know what I'm doing. 




 Thanks~! 




 It says my email is already in use...but that's because I already have an account. How do I fix this? 




 I got the same Xbox package. I almost broke it rolling around in happiness. 




 Sorry, was trying to sneak the picture whilst standing in line to hand it in.
 









 Your HTML skills make me fear your photoshop skills. 




 Omnipotence. 




 Yup! Southeast Wisconsin. Can't wait to get to the hills tomorrow! 









 Being in Wisconsin, half of my teachers planned around the hopeful snow day. Others just planned for a movie or test (genius). 




 The middle ring-that's fine. The BOTTOM RING. NEIN. And of course it's the bottom right on *all* of my binders. 




 ...Do you at least get lack of snow days? 




 Relevant, because it was just announced that my school has a snow day tomorrow! 




 For those of you that get snow days, what is your plan for the day? Snowboarding? That homework you didn't do? All I know is that I have a huge can of Code Red and Minecraft in my taskbar waiting patiently for me! 




 You fuck. This was awesome. 




 The Algorithm. MATHCORE FTW. 




 Being a freshman, this is a dangerous attempt buuuut, here goes. 
 1. Walk on the right side of the hallway. I don't wish for you to walk over me.
 2. Don't you dare point out we were supposed to turn in homework 10 minutes before class ends. 
 3. Upperclassmen own the school. Get over it.
 4. If you are a freshman, walk against the wall. It saves the rest of the planet from walking into your backpack.
 5. Do not announce it is your birthday if you did not bring a snack. 85% of people at school don't care.
 6. We know you're tired. Anyone who has to wake up at 4:30 in the morning for school is tired. Stop complaining and go to sleep. 




 Alright, I have done my fair share of interesting presentations. You could do a paper and presentation on Japanese culture. Or Vocaloids. I was asked by a teacher to put together a powerpoint and the class was absolutely hooked by singing holograms. It really is fun to research. You could write a persuasive paper on a famous (or even controversial) person. I have a friend who wrote a persuasive essay on why Ivan the Terrible wasn't actually that terrible. Freedom and the Internet is also a go-to topic for me.   




 What type of topic are you aiming for? 




 Thank you! My brain must have shut down~ 




 Could someone explain the Imperialist? 




 I now enjoy you greatly. The only thing that could have made the Japanese better was if it was possible to put it in someone's voice. 









 Absolutely. I have a couple fandoms where I'm always thinking of more ideas, most of which I end up being too lazy to throw on paper. Others it is a rather painful experience and I hope that I never get a request for them. 




 From what I know, a group of griefers. They griefed the farm of my friends and I, who, from what I know, have done nothing to provoke any griefing. 




 Don't want to join due to fear of being a target, but you have gained an ally! I'm always willing to help others in the server!
Edit: Unless you're in my base/taking my stuff. Then I will either do my best to crush you or run away in fear. Probably the latter. 




 [Here's me before snowboarding a couple weeks ago.](http://i.imgur.com/V1iNo.jpg) It was also my first or second week on the server.  




 I can't stand the pointless griefing either. I get when two teams/players have a grudge between them or war is declared or something, but my friends and I built a huge farm open for use by anyone (as long as seeds are replanted) and we keep getting griefed. This isn't playing. This is immaturity. DFS and RoT have hit us so far.  




 This is awesome. But I didn't get asshole on my envelope. I got my name. 




 How did you find out? Did you do extensive research and come to the conclusion? Did you see a therapist? 




 I see. I'll make sure to watch for you guys then :) 




 What does the rest of it stand for? 




 Yes...I loved that base. It was a shared base. I have a much nicer one now. I needed to renovate anyways~ 




 I know it's a Hindu peace sign, but I doubt whoever made it intended it as such.  














 Not as much r/nosleep as much as it is r/wtf. 




 So...this app is only available in the UK... 




 When reddit shuts down and after half an hour of refreshing, only vaguely admitting defeat. 




 I see. That makes sense then. 
 




 But who knows how long each power would last? 




 College is free in the UK? Lucky! 




 Today the power (well, the lights) shut off in half the school and the network was down so we all got sent home.  




 I have these. They work really well.  




 I've come across settlements (and seen pictures) with HUGE amounts of obsidian. I'm just wondering where it all came from.  




 This tactic really doesn't work. It usually ends with "If you want to fuck up, go right ahead."  




 Nope, the 4. I don't have money (or the desire) for a 5 so I'm glad it's safe. 




 Unique? After looking at the comments here, I really have to find a different one. Let's see...I got it! That swoopy 2010 Bieber hair cut. No. I don't want to feel like I'm dating someone who is either 12 and/or just took a helmet off after a week. 




 Absolutely. Accents are awesome. My friend and I go nuts over them~ 
 









 Don't know; I'm more in the Sunburst/Little Switz area. They should have some snow made though, it's been cold enough.  




 I'm American and write similar to that. Not necessarily cursive, but not full on printing.  




 Momo and Rukia. I just couldn't stand Rukia from the beginning, and Momo is pretty damn useless. At least Komamura can use bankai. Or a decent shikai for that matter... 









 Yes, I dumped chocolate milk on my iPhone. It was charging pleasantly on the table. My cup of milk was sitting pleasantly near it. That is fuck up number one. Number two was when I decided to grab my cup for a drink of that lovely beverage. Miss. I hit the cup and the milk went flying on my phone. I have never ran so fast than when I did to get some rice to throw my phone in. I also managed to wipe excess milk off with my shirt. It has survived (for now-last time it got wet, it took days to take effect) and is currently in a bag of rice. Fuck.  




 I see. I've had teachers that go absolutely nuts over scantron. 4 question vocabulary quiz? SCANTRON. 




 You have to pay for them?
