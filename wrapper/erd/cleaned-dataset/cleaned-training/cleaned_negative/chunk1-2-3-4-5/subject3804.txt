 Kinda reminds me of the Axe Flinger. Deals 2 damage to the face for each hit. Nice idea though! 




 Wanna try a new game, but have no idea how to quit this one. Is there some way to end the subscription? I was born with the "Depression" feature and it makes playing this game really boring. 

Anyone know of any better games to play?

Mike reminded me of Danny DeVito as Owen in "Throw Momma From the Train"  




 Effects like that happen in a queue. It's odd, but a great mechanic to learn to be pro. Pretty much first effect play, first effect resolved. When you played Shadow Madness first, it had to resolve  before Power Overwhelming.

 R.I.P OP, you poor bastard  
























 Humans. Humans never change. 

I kinda do see this becoming reality one day, as history repeats itself. We'd find a weaker, submissive race and make them do our dirty work.

I love humans! 




 You must have been petrified.
