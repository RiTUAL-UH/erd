 My bet also goes to Guild wars 2.If nothing it was the most anticipated 




 It reminds me a lot of mount and blade,though i am yet to pick up chivarly.Is it worth getting? 




 You're a real asshole scott,aren't you? 




 Australian! 




 Random question,how much would it cost now? 




 I like it!I must say,i didnt have the time to read it all,but from what i read,you have a good story on your hands!Also,a tip from a fellow writer.If you are getting stuck on what to write next,try adding something conpletely unexpected.Suprise yourself.What if it wasnt only the humans that carry the virus now?What if even the sealife is,well fucked,and under attack by the virus? 




 Now the real question is,can they swim? 




 Rasprava o tome koji je burek PRAVI burek 




 I admit i gave up on reading that after the part which reminded me of hippopotamus. 




 Shush...dont use that word... 




 Hell to the no. 




 B..b..but we bassists are different! 




 Ko da su ikad postovali 




 You know,now that youve said it kinda makes sense.Never really thought about it,mostly due to him saying he got the character from that Child Roland poem 




 SAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAXTOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON..................
 




 Playing Video Games.Sometimes it just hits me that im getting older each day and a part of me thinks im just wasting time 




 Wait i can throw my weapons?
 




 The best way to put someone down online is to use as many big words as you can.
 









 Np,glad I could help 




 I recently dreamt of being a vampire during the zombie apocalypse.Yes,my mind is fucked up. 




 I'd say Batman from DC and Deadpool/thor from Marvel 




 Well /r/Steamtrade it is I think,haven't been there in a while 




 You guys should try out Lost Planet 2...even though the game received a negative response from the ign/gamespot,two of my friends and I found the campaign quite entertaining.Aspecially if you enjoy Big Boss Battles.

As for it having to be free,well I'd have to say you could always try Spiral Knights...that's the only free coop game that is right now on my mind

Edit: Just remembered,if you don't mind downloading it,you can get Marvels Ultimate Alliance.Now that game is something fun to play,and I'd say its  maybe 3-4 years old 




 Do your palms sweat a lot while you play?It might have messed with the wires inside of your mouse,causing it to malfunction... I remember a similiar thing happening to my old mouse,just I think the back space key on it stopped working.
 




 The reason you are getting downvoted is probably becouse you are either trying to sell something you received for free,or becouse you are not posting on the trade sub.
I would suppose that you would get a better response there,good luck. 




 Looks pretty damn cool anyway :D
 




 How can you not remember this?

 




 Nice!Did you draw it? 




 Born to be downoted would seem more fitting. 




 Would be funny if someone gave her the link to this..Now that would be something worth watching! 




 I know I havent yet done any trades through reddit,but i made a few through the steam forums.Anyway,the game is 5$ on amazon now,and becouse I dont have flair and am not allowed to trade this i think,i will go first if that will suit rules better.

I can add some sweets if needed. 




 I must agree with sir Ryezing.You should apologize,but dont go too far with it.There is an old anegdote,describing a mans desperate tries to apologize to his boss.Luckily i managed to find it:

 Eh well,I honestly tried writting you a haiku.But unfortunately my non traditional(5-7-5)haikus were spat on from the side of Private.
So i will call this a-short-not-a-haiku-poem-that-rhymes

Fine Says He.
Then spits on poetry of me,
The Private he be.

Good enough? 
























 Serbian here,and stereotypes go towards everything here.But it goes more like an internal joke and less as an insult 




 I personally turn of system sounds quite early.Dont worry,you are perfectly fine 




 Ever tried Pringles with Chocolate? 




 Well post some funny/interesting things online that i would usually keep on my phone and show to friends as a silence buster 




 Screen-Five!(It's like a highfive just you slap your monitor and pretend like i did it at the same time you did) 




 Completely dry?That doesnt sound as good as you think 




 Now imagine all those facebook statuses all rolled up there.The horror. 




 Lets hope he gets more lines this time. 




 So i ran upon the game on gamestop,and it seemed interesting though i never heard of it before.Im usually into RPGs,Action and Adventure games,but usually the strong story is the key. 




 For some reason,now i want to go to the russian youtube. 




 She blesses the vampire,which are in some stories afraid of holy things,such as holy water,crosses... 




 Tell me you saw a bunch of cute puppies and you kept one because of the eyes.Please tell me thats true 




 "Thanks for shopping with us,come again!"
"You too." 




 Your life story would be much better if you gave those girls a chance. 




 Well,now you have 227 more than on your last one 




 I always thought the lower boundary is 65%.Well atleast thats how it used to work here 




 Its even worse when the other guy is wrong,so you get hope you are right,then you end up wrong aswell 




 He also shaved his beard! 




 Id say you should try out Dead Island,its a decently fun game worth its price.As for borderlands,yeah,definetely get it 




 Lets fire a few rounds on it and see what happens 




 Whoever wants to play something can feel free to add me,Doctor Von Foster or pm me your gamertag.I have Dead Island,Fable 2,Halo Reach,Forza 3 and MK Vs DC,so if you need help wih anything or just want to have fun im here! 




 Hell im up for it if comes to it.Hit me up a pm if it ever happens 




 As a galio player,i get you bro 




 "Call the priest!" 




 Hes just waiting,dont be fooled by its appearance 




 Then blaspheme we shall! 




 Tequilla.Lots of it. 




 They should,as long as the games are purschased they should work just fine.The only problem is the free to play games,they tend to dissaear if theres a region lock 




 Just a random question,what genre is the game?It looks pretty interesting 




 This and Wait and Bleed go hand in hand when it comes to workout music. 




 Just let him hide under the bed like he wants to. 




 What mod is on it?Im pretty new to he game,dont judge me 




 Oh i see.Though mount and blade has very large,well done multiplayer battles,the SP factor of it plays a bigger role 




 Back in my days we had cats that would eat that mouse in seconds!Twice! 
























 Its a secret grandma,its a secret. 




 Dont you get that shit near me! 




 Unlike you,stuck in your own time,overrun by the new generations. 




 That sounds real bad man.Well trust me,you can do better than a girl that wont help you go over bad times.Youll find another one,if you didnt already :) 




 So its a God-Of-War-ish RPG?Also does it have any sort of decent multiplayer?
 




 Ever tried telling the bitch the shit that was happening in your life? 




 Awful breakup here,i still loved the girl and she just told me its over out of clear sky.Feels bad bro. 




 A car that cant go forward. 




 What,so you can take a picture of them and say its yours?No way. 




 No!Halt,put your first impressions aside,I am a miracle worker! 




 I think they tried to stick to 'how it would look if it was all perfect'
Though in real life,youd be pretty sure to get shot as soon as sighted even if you had a big red cross on your head. 




 Have fun 




 Cowboy/girl,Police officer.Things you can dress up as with normal clothes.Or spray some red paint on your clothes and face and call yourself a zombie. 




 The leader got arrested for public masturbation,thats where it ended i think 




 One random thing.When did you get that text that she wants you to call her?It might start turning strange to her that shes not getting the call.Also,does her boyfriend have a deeper voice?I know i usually get confused with my father due to having the same voice as him over the phone.Im running dry on ideas here. 




 You are 100% sure that her mother wouldnt let her go?The very worst thing that can happen is her mother coming over to check up on you two, realising you've been lying to her,which would most likely end up quite badly. 




 Blade,BLACK panther... 




 Only Siths deal in absolutes. 




 I would not recommend it,but if you end up doing it,i want the pics 




 Ever noticed they never shoot the medics in Saving Private Ryan?Thats due to it being 'illegal',army medics are also not allowed to carry weapons,due to that. 




 Well ill start....how did it feel? 




 You know anyone older to take the role of your dad?Or tell the woman you are having voice problems and you cant talk right now. 




 A bear.So I could wrestle with him every time i come back from work! 




 Well i remember my parents always helping me out on things like this.Well at least my dad.How 'cool' is your dad on these things?He might be able to help you out. 




 Youtube.Watching two turtles doing it is always funnier while under the effects of alcohol. 




 Spit it. 




 "Hell to the no" 




 Fear.Children always terrified me due to unknown reasons. 




 Original ones.But if memory serves me well,i once tried it with hot and spicy.The way the tastes crash makes your tongue have an orgasm.Have fun! 




 "Fail" 




 Payphone by Maroon 5.I just cant say how much it reminded me of myself after a sudden break up maybe 3-4 months ago.It just came out of clear sky.Well atleast for my side. 




 Seeing someone i know in a place i dont. 




 A very fun night out in my experience.Worst i remember was 600 euros,but there was more of us to pay the price 




 Well the ideas are either r/cosplay or r/Halloween,but im not sure for specifics 
























 Heavy is pretty princess 




 Request sent :3

 Hes a mad scientist,not a primarch 




 Ever thought of Killing floor?I remember picking up a 4 pack with a bunch of friends,we still play it from time to time 




 Not interested really in paying for something that drops in a bonus game mode.Maybe for items? 




 Check out my inventory on steam,just type in Von Foster,im the only guy around.I didnt log into dota in a while,so im unsure of the essence prices 




 How much do you price the essences for? 




 Drink AND drive?No,you cant do that.Trust me,im a doctor. 




 Well depends what zombies are we talking about here. 




 Well it can always fracture as you are tackled down.Also,you know how the eagles drop down turtles to break their shells?Well you are getting the idea. 




 Or crappy oponnents  




 "IT WASNT ME I SWEAR" 




 Wait wait wait,im a bit confused about this.Ye it makes sense if everyone has only one gun,but if they all have two guns,wouldnt the first one to fire actually 'win'? 




 They might be hyperlinks,for all we know. 




 Are you his father?! 




 Could you give me the link to the other post? 




 I didnt honestly see the other post,because i mostly stick to pther subreddits,plus yes,i really was told this last morning.So if it really is a repost,I am sorry. 




 Halloween parties and such events may occur earlier than the said date. 




 Also a hotel in Alan Ford. 




 As a doctor,i can confirm his statement. 




 Let it die.It isnt interesting 




 If they are your age,I do not see the problem here. 




 Those are the trophies of badassery
 




 That comic is not allowed to be posted.Read the rules.
 




 As a guy,I can tell you I would mostly love if we could cut the chase.Yeah,chasing is fun from time to time,but it can get annoying some times if it lasts too long. 




 Get a hobby.For me its working out.It might sound boring,but by going to the gym i usually relieve myself of the stresses of the day that passed 




 the....? 









 Silly dog,you are not suppost to post! 
























 What if you make it so that the rebel leader kills the civilians,making it look as if the agents did it?It would buff up the rebels morale,and add depth to the short 




 Bro,girl to the left is mia lina,atleast if my memory still serves me well 




 After 2 years of casually playing team fortress 2,i gave it a try to actually play seriously,and not for fun...Truth be told,it was quite interesting thinking about the game for the first time and developing harder strategies. 




 Must say,thats pure crap from them. 




 I think i should have gotten them already,but there are no points in sight.Also,maybe that was US only? 




 My GT is Dr Von Foster,feel free to add me if you want to play some times :) I have Halo reach,Halo 4,Fable 2,MK vs DC,Dead Island,All those free games from Live and Forza 3.Of course,we can all just always play happy wars :) 




 Ah i see.In serbian it litteraly translates to bottom,like the bottom of a pit,rather than down.But given the context,i see how they use it 




 A windrunner waving to a drow ranger,which is facepalming due to...windrunner being extremely 'interesting' 




 http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Flag_Blank.svg there you go :) 




 By far the best Windrunner response http://www.dota2wiki.com/images/0/0e/Wind_attack_06.mp3 




 doesnt dno() stand for bottom?Might mean as in bottom tier player,as far as i know 




 No,sorry

Happy holidays mate :) 




 you happen to be trading/giving away some of those?
 




 Great,thanks for answering so quickly 




 So during diretide,i have recieved an egg and didnt infuse it with any essences.After some time,i have forgotten about it,eventually leading to its expiration.So my question is,do the eggs still drop im game like in diretide?And are there any specific ways to get them,like winning the greeviling(didnt prove as such for now) if yes? Thanks in advance,Doc 




 I got a call of the dendochreon for furion just a couple of minutes ago from a nice gift.Furion being my all time favorite hero,this made my day! 









 Hey man,you interested in trading your keys for metal?

 Nah,sorry im only looking for metal.Plus as far a i read on the spreadheet,its 3 ref 




 I have a genuine war head.Does that change the price?
