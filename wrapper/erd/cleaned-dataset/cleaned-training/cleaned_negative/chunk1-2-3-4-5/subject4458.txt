 Welp, I am now mentally invigorated 
























 The reason they make noise is because invisibility.

 Ah, sorry.  I should've probably made the text bigger or put it in the title.  I put in that I preferred the game wasn't an FPS or a MOBA.  I agree with you fully though that those are pretty great games. 




   
**Preferably not FPS or a MOBA.**  
Also here are some games I already own and played with others:  
-Monaco   
-Trine 2   
-Hammerwatch

 Also went to that high school.  The fact that Snoop used to go there is one thing I like to brag to my friends about.

 Anyone around the San Jose best buy? As of now I know it hasn't started yet but let me know how the lines are 




 We can and I would encourage the community to form opinions.  The only thing is that we shouldn't be too critical of the product.  If anything it's another flavor of smash to play, not everyone's cup of tea but it's something.  And if nintendo is really pushing forth this whole ideal of bridging the smash community I would bet that patches are going to be a very prevalent part of this game.  




 Too lazy to make a Conker game, make it yourself. 




 How easy is it to pick up and play torchlight 1 for someone who doesn't have any experience with ARPGs  




 Sadly yes :/
