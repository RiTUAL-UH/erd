 [A Touch of Cloth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Touch_of_Cloth), biting satire of British procedurals (and American). It was created by Charlie Brooker who worked with Chris Morris on Nathan Barley. Chris Morris played Denholm Reynholm from IT Crowd. I could go on, but I have to poo. 




 I am very much looking forward to Russo and Dinosaur's next project.

 I loved the first episode, but this one blew me away. You're right: waaaaay too many moments. [I like Ilsa's ability to take people out with bubblegum.](http://i.imgur.com/XrNkwGH.gifv)

 Danger 5 




 Not in the novelization by Arson Scote Lard 



















 It's a great show! 




 Thank you my friend! I just posted some more [here](https://imgur.com/a/Nnq92)  
The first one is my favorite Ilsa scene in that episode. 









 ha ha! that is perfect! 




 At first I was like wat but then I listened to his single "Stop Bitin' (My Friend's Face)." Now I'm like #clubnewpierre.

 Hot Soccermom is def not as relaxed as he is on the podcast. The humor is completely different, but it's still funny.

 As others have stated, there are too many to list. This show has that great blend of cringe, surrealism, and absurdity which is very hard to do well.

 This is from Mark Loves Sharon, featuring both Jason and Dailan from The Wedge. I think the Mark Wary character was first shown on The Wedge a year or so before this. [nsfw clip](http://i.imgur.com/09ZLAgA.gifv)

 I wonder who's going to mouth off to Selina next. 









 He's incredibly funny and he absolutely steals every scene with those little throwaway lines. I hope they do a Richard/Jonah focused episode just so I can see if he can keep the funny going in larger doses. I think he can pull it off.

 Ooo great idea will have to revisit this one 




 Its "the walk," Hollywood version of man on wire. 




 That's a good idea, but I'm going to have to wait for the movie to come out. Right where this ends giant "coming soon" "imax 3d" text comes zooming in towards the viewer. My orig idea was to do a huge 3d k zooming in after the 3d imax, but I couldn't get the timing to work. Also I tried fading out "the walk" to just "k" but that looked stupid with my shitty ae skills.

 haha ya idk why, that little jump makes me laugh every time. i love it. 



















 that's a killer thread, surprised to see it's still alive since 2013. i would definitely pay for a native linux port. i wonder what it would take to make at least the save-for-web gif equivalent for imagemagick. no matter what i try i just can't replicate the same level of gif quality using convert or gimp.
