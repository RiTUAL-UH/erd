 Tortilla Flats by John Steinbeck

I would definitely recommend this book to any veteran transitioning over to the civilian world. It's a really great book that portrays the brotherhood of soldiers and how its a lifelong bond that helps brothers through difficult situations. It does this through the story of 3 poor veterans of World War 1.  




 I disagree. 

I know of many others things that very closely relate to being a parent. Yes, being a parent involves a mass amount of time and dedication, in which you are legally obligated to dedicate such time. However, many other things require lots of time and dedication. The only difference is the ability to give up on those things without legal/social repercussions.

 Definitely! I'd have to say of all of them DMT is one that cannot be explained, too much is going on, you're in a different world. And everyones world is different in their own experience.

 It makes sense. Like what the hell else do you do all day when you're that age? Hit the bottle or the pipe im sure. 




 Status, its big and expensive and when I drive past others it makes them question why I own such a vehicle. Or maybe youre just passing these people in there off time, what if they use the fuck out of their suv from the hours of 8-5, hours of working people. Hours you most likely do not drive... being a musician and all... 




 Damn dude, your brain is already damaged if you're legitimately concerned and asking this question on Reddit instead of researching it yourself or seeking medical advice from a medical provider. You're done, that brain has been vaporized. 




 Because I can afford it and I like it. I'm sure if you could afford something and liked it, you'd have one. 




 Did no one teach you children how to smile correctly? Really, it's not that hard.

 That's also the locket that was struck by a projectile while he was a junior enlisted officer. It was given to him by his uncle, who was a great military officer in the American Revolution. Before his marriage to Rachel, Jackson kept a picture of his mother in the lockett. He had it repaired before his wedding and the picture of his mother replaced with Rachel's picture.

 Detroit ATC here, this is actually quite common. I'd say it happens at least once or twice a month from sept to may. Has no one ever seen the pictures? I know some guy submitted a bunch last winter. 




 I admitted to stealing government supplies, lying, cheating, and taking drugs to the special agent and psychologist interviewing me.

 I mean he could have never even fought any of these guys, I mean it is an autobiography, but I like to believe he was the Shaft of his generation. 




 From his narrative, Frederick Douglass went around chesting up to slave owners, learning to read and write through perseverance and deceit, and then became a free man who worked to tear down the institutions of slavery.

 The PDSA Dickin Medal, recognised worldwide as the animals Victoria Cross, is awarded to animals displaying conspicuous gallantry or devotion to duty while serving or associated with any branch of the Armed Forces or Civil Defence Units. The PDSA Dickin Medal is the highest award any animal can receive whilst serving in military conflict.

The Medal, which can only be considered on receipt of an official commendation, has been awarded 65 times since 1943. The recipients comprised 32 pigeons, 29 dogs, three horses and one cat. In 2014 the first and only Honorary PDSA Dickin Medal was awarded to war horse Warrior on behalf of all animals that served in World War I.

 After just a couple of hours drifting, the boat exploded. Most believe that a Soviet torpedo hit and sank the Struma. The Turks did not send out rescue boats until the next morning - they only picked up one survivor (David Stoliar). All 767 of the other passengers perished. 









 The festival was staged on the area of a former freight station. The capacity of the enclosed location was limited to 250,000 people,[6] but more than one million visitors were expected, based on the experience of previous years.

Entrance should have been granted at 11:00, but was granted at 12:00 CEST.[7]A 240-metre tunnel from the east and a series of underpasses from the west met at a ramp that was supposed to be the only entrance and exit point of the festival area.[8] A smaller ramp existed between the underpasses from the west. Because of overcrowding, police at the entrance began announcing over loudspeakers that new arrivals should turn around and head back.[9][10] The side of the tunnel that was the entry of the parade area was closed, but people continued to enter the tunnel from the rear, despite being told it was closed. The deaths occurred as the ramp between tunnel underpasses and the festival area became overcrowded.[11][12]

There was some debate as to how the deaths occurred. Some reports suggested they were caused by people falling off a staircase as they tried to escape the tunnel.[13] However, autopsies showed that all of the fatalities were due to crushed rib cages.[13][14] A 2012 scientific analysis of the causes of the disaster dismissed the earlier descriptions of the incident as stampede or crowd panic, and instead found evidence for a phenomenon called "crowd turbulence".[1] 









 After the earthquake, survivors began injecting opium on a large scale. It was easily accessible, due to Bam's location on a trade route for drugs coming from Afghanistan and Pakistan. By 2006, over 50% of men and roughly 15% of women were addicted. The youngest addict was reported to be 11 years of age. Construction workers have historically been large injectors, and the rise in addiction may be attributed to them passing needle onto the public. An anonymous UNICEF worker claimed that drugs were slowing reconstruction and lessening motivation.[37]

 I've always heard that when a dog turns sideways to another dog/animal, it means he is acknowledging that it is your territory, but it is still asserting itself. Apparently if you turn your back to a dog it shows submissiveness and youre more likely to be attacked. Can anyone confirm? Dog specifically? 




 Oooo you know what that made me think of a great one with dogs! But great input! 




 I read the comments to a cat video the other day and someone mentioned the cats tail between its legs, moving the way it was, means the cats pissed. What are some other good signs to know that animals give? (humans included)  




 Get the fuck out of there 




 I'd just take the seizures thank you 




 Name so relevant  




 that's all i was trying to say. I mean I dont think anyone deserves to be physically assaulted for something so petty. But rewind before the woman assaulted her, put an older, more handicap person in the other vehicle and now who's the asshole?  




 Deserved it by no means, means did not deserve it fyi. I can give two shits about downvotes, but seriously like the other guy said she tried stealing the spot from another handicap person. Shes a dick. If shes not a dick, she obviously shouldnt be driving if she was unaware of what was going on. I mean youre all on her side because shes the victim, but what if the person in the other car was older or more handicap? Then you'd all be bashing her. So whatever spin you'd like to take go for it, I still stand by my argument that she put herself in that situation, did she deserve it? by no means. By no means did she deserve it. Deserve it she did not. She did not deserve it. Theyre ya go, now back to watching your VHS thunderdome tapes. 




 Am I the only one who thinks she kinda was asking for it? I mean she straight up jacked someones spot at walmart. Thats like walking through a whore a house and being shocked when you get your junk grabbed. Deserved it by no means. 




 hmm... you have my attention... What was in the box?? some beanie babies? 




 I like this article. I own quite a few guns, from pistols to shotguns to rifles. But I also believe in some sort of system that should be in place for weapon ownership. I respect weapons, but I'm ex military and at one point I had a concealed carry license. I know the laws on weapons. I've seen the damage they can do firsthand. I am not the typical gun owner though. Like everything, the more educated you are about something, the less you're likely to abuse it ignorantly.  




 He's in the military now.

 I used to love the guy. Then about a year back I read an article about him blocking some lawsuit from environmentalist groups against the oil industry with some bullshit excuse about jobs and keeping the industry here. Then he went did his little guest appearance on Duck Dynasty. Kinda opened up my eyes, like what the fuck is our Governor doing on Duck Dynasty?
 




 i disagree
