Seralini ran a bastardization between a sub chronic toxicity study and a carcinogenicity study, with using only 10 rats per sex per group and running it for 2 years.  
  
Also Seralini did not run any statistical analysis on mortality or tumor prevalence. His data, due to sample size and short duration was inadequate to determine if any of his observed effects were statitically significant.

The retraction statement could have been clearer, and should have referred to the relevant COPE guidelines. The data are inconclusive, therefore the claim (ie, conclusion) that Roundup Ready maize NK603 and/or the Roundup herbicide have a link to cancer is unreliable.

EFSA finds that the study as reported by Sralini et al. is of insufficient scientific quality for safety assessments.

**TLDR:** Seralini's 2012 study is full of elementary mistakes and follows an inadequate protocol that fails to support the conclusions it makes. 




 A big issue with the rat (Seralini) study was the very small sample size, it was small enough that they were unable to do any statistical analysis on tumor prevalence and mortality.  




 Monsanto has never sued over accidental cross pollination, they've sued over willful and intentional isolation of their seed and growing without a license.  




 and that their conclusions were predetermined (e.g., pseudoscience).
  
[Citation Needed] 




 Just to point out that the study that WTCMolybdenum4753 is citing was originally retracted for being of fundamentally flawed study design and conclusion.  




 That's because most GMOs such as corn are hybrids and don't bread true, [you get a similar effect with non GMO hybrids.](http://www.researchgate.net/publication/41560478_TRANSGRESSIVE_SEGREGATION_IN_F2_GENERATION_OF_MAIZE_HYBRIDS_GROWN_FOR_GRAIN_AND_SILAGE) 




 Yes, while there was a time in which sterile seeds/GURT was being developed they have never been brought to market.  




 This is due to them being hybrid varieties, not to being genetically engineered.  




 I stopped caring about Goodall when it came out that she plagiarized her book.  




 Seralini's study was retracted for being fundamentally flawed and down right worthless.  




 The WHO and Lancet studies should be honestly looked at and considered without prejudiced.
  
They are the same study.  




 [Here is a published response to Jack Heinemanns's study.](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14735903.2014.939842) 




 It's just that bird law in this countryit's not governed by reason. 




 I didn't call glyphosate a carcinogen. 
  
Edit: Apparently this was a joke that flew past my head.  




 They should see if they can get the specs of the Surface 3 into a phone, maybe down clock the CPU a bit for thermal/battery reasons.  




 Germany is much more fond of the precautionary principle than the US is.

 [Here is a point by point response to the book/film Genetic Roulette.](http://academicsreview.org/reviewed-content/genetic-roulette/) 




 Yes, some of them are written or funded in part by Monsanto but not all of them. One of the larger ones cited "the AHS" is [not.](http://aghealth.nih.gov/collaboration/) 
  
Also just because a study might be funded or authored by someone who has a conflict of interest does not mean that the science is flawed or inadequate.  




 What developed nations actively ban the use of glyphosate?
  
 There have been issues with farmers dying from direct contact with it since it came into use.
  
The only real cases of farmers dying from glyphosate exposure are easily suicide related when the farmer consumes large amounts of a concentrated solution.

 According to Argentina's union of medical professionals, Fesprosa, glyphosate, not only causes cancer. It is also associated with increased spontaneous abortions, birth defects, skin diseases, and respiratory and neurological disease. 

  
Here are some studies and reviews on the safety and risk of glyphosate.

There was no evidence of a carcinogenic effect related toglyphosatetreatment. The lack of a plausible mechanism, along with published epidemiology studies, which fail to demonstrate clear, statistically significant, unbiased and non-confounded associations betweenglyphosateand cancer of any single etiology, and a compelling weight of evidence, support the conclusion thatglyphosatedoes not present concern with respect to carcinogenic potential in humans.

Note that there was a weak but slight association with multiple myeloma that the authors suggest that further follow up is required. Also this was among applicators who inherently are exposed to significantly higher amounts of glyphosate than end product consumers.

  
Also a re-analysis of the AHS data failed to show the same link between glyphosate and multiple meyloma.

[Epidemiologic studies of glyphosate and cancer: A review](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273230012000943)
  
To examine potential cancer risks in humans, we reviewed the epidemiologic literature to evaluate whether exposure to glyphosate is associated causally with cancer risk in humans. We also reviewed relevant methodological and biomonitoring studies of glyphosate. Seven cohort studies and fourteen case-control studies examined the association between glyphosate and one or more cancer outcomes. Our review found no consistent pattern of positive associations indicating a causal relationship between total cancer (in adults or children) or any site-specific cancer and exposure to glyphosate.

 The few times that I've used the base 5k I've noticed it a little during certain task. Also several reviews have also documented slight performance issues with the base GPU. The performance of the base might not be too big of an issue to you, but that is heavily dependent on the kind of work/programs you will be using.  




 The McLaren F1 is also a lot more expensive and rare then the LaFerrari.  




 There are a handful on the open market, and while Ferrari claims to make "x" amount of their hyper cars they rarely do. The Enzo sold a good 60+ beyond their official figure.  




 Stig's problem was due to the car not being set up properly in terms of its suspension.  




 You do know that GMO tomatoes don't exist on the market right? 




 There are several on the used market already.  




 Or Ikea! 




 I'd stay away from the 5K unless you are going for the top of the line version. The base mobile GPU is going to struggle pushing that many pixels.  




 They are better, but if you run the computer at the quasi full HD resolution you will get the occasional dropped frames and sluggishness.  




 Monsanto has never sued over accidental cross pollination of their crops. 
  
About the Schmeiser case.  

 I'll quote the actual court case.
  
[In late June or early July of 1997, Mr. Schmeiser and his employee Carlyle Moritz hand sprayed Roundup around power poles and in the ditches along the Bruno road where it bordered fields 1, 2, 3 and 4. This was part of his normal weed control practice. Several days after the spraying, he noticed that a large number of canola plants had survived the spraying. To determine why the canola plants had survived the Roundup spraying, Mr. Schmeiser conducted a test in field 2. Using a machine sprayer set to spray 40 feet, he sprayed Roundup on a section of field 2 in a strip along the road. He made two passes, the first weaving between and around the power poles and the second adjacent to the first pass, parallel to the power poles. He testified that by this means he sprayed a good three acres of field 2. According to Mr. Schmeiser's evidence, after some days, approximately 60% of the canola plants sprayed were still alive, growing in clumps that were thickest near the road and thinner as one moved into the field.[23]At harvest time in 1997 Mr. Schmeiser, who was then recovering from a leg injury, instructed Mr. Moritz to swath and combine field 2. Mr. Moritz did so, harvesting the canola in the field as well as the surviving canola along the roadside. The harvested seed was put into the box of a 1962 Ford pickup truck. The box was covered with a tarp and the truck with its tarped load of canola seed was stored in one of Mr. Schmeiser's buildings over the winter.[24]Mr. Schmeiser testified that in the spring of 1998 the seed from the Ford truck was transferred to another truck and taken to the Humboldt Flour Mill for treatment, a normal process to rid the seeds of disease before planting. The treated seed, mixed with untreated seed from his granary ("bin-run seed"), was planted in all or part of each of his nine fields, for a total of 1,030 acres.](http://decisions.fca-caf.gc.ca/en/2002/2002fca309/2002fca309.html)  
  
  
His crop did not magically become 95-98% RR canola purity overnight and the court realized this. Schmeiser was not sued over accidental cross pollination, but over intentionally isolating RR canola plants and planting the seed the following year.

The overall trend is striking. From 1980 until 1987, opium production only gradually increased. However after the defeat of the Soviets, opium production skyrocketed. This alarming trend was affected by a drought that occurred between 1995 and 1998. After the drought during Taliban rule, opium production surged to over 4,000 MT in 2000 (Blanchard 2009, 4). In 2001, the Taliban, caving into international pressure declared opium production illegal (Blanchard 2009, 3). This campaign was very effective, and in 2001, only 200 MT of opium was produced. But, in 2002, when the new, weak Karzai regime took control over Afghanistan, opium production increased and reached record levels, with an unprecedented yield of 8,200 MT, or 193,000 hectares in 2007 (Blanchard 2009, 4). The rise in the opium economy has created many opportunities for insurgent groups, militia, and warlords to finance their operations against one another.

  Trying to blame the life expectancy gap of wealth by saying it is due to obesity is a wild stretch.
  
I'm just saying that you haven't offered any evidence in defense of your original claim. Your data needs to be normalized to take into account obesity and socioeconomic status.  




 Considering that something like 80% of public schools in the US serve fast food
  
[Did you just pull that figure out of your ass? The actual figure is closer to 24%](http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/business/SNDA3summ.pdf) 




 That doesn't prove what your quote is saying is true or not. Your data for expected life and income/education is not normalized to take into account obesity. There could be a chance that the reason why rich people live longer is due to that most are of a healthy weight, for we already know that obesity rates do in fact correlate with poverty and lack of education.  




 They are wrong, just by your weight alone puts you into a higher risk tier and any medical professional worth his/her salt should not ignore the pending risk. It would be like telling a smoker who appears healthy not to worry about the risk of smoking.

 You're doctor might not be aware of the current scientific knowledge on the risk associated with obesity. 




 In this large prospective study, obesity was strongly associated with the risk of death in both men and women in all racial and ethnic groups and at all ages. After we accounted for potential bias owing to preexisting disease and residual confounding by smoking status by using midlife BMI values and restricting the analysis to participants who had never smoked, we found that even moderate elevations in BMI conferred an increased risk of death. The risk among participants who were overweight at the age of 50 years was 20 to 40 percent higher than that among participants who had a BMI of 23.5 to 24.9 at that age. The risk among obese subjects was two to at least three times that of participants with a BMI of 23.5 to 24.9. The risk of death among underweight participants was attenuated.

 For the time being, but the fact that you are obese (BMI34) means you are at increase risk of chronic obesity related illness and disease. 
  
But over time, this group began to develop risk factors for chronic disease. After 10 years about 40 percent had become unhealthy obese, and by the 20-year mark 51 percent had fallen into the unhealthy category, the study found....This study suggests that obese people will eventually develop risk factors such as high blood sugar and bad cholesterol that lead to chronic illness and death, Bell and Freeman said.

To examine potential cancer risks in humans, we reviewed the epidemiologic literature to evaluate whether exposure to glyphosate is associated causally with cancer risk in humans. We also reviewed relevant methodological and biomonitoring studies of glyphosate. Seven cohort studies and fourteen case-control studies examined the association between glyphosate and one or more cancer outcomes. Our review found no consistent pattern of positive associations indicating a causal relationship between total cancer (in adults or children) or any site-specific cancer and exposure to glyphosate.

 There is more to a good screen then just resolution. TN panels are cheap display usually found on budget netbooks, it's an insult that Apple is selling a $1000 machine with such a screen. The pro line on the other hand uses IPS which are vastly superior.  




  Isn't the point of a GMO is that you spray MORE pesticides?

Only herbicides, not insecticides like neonicotinoids. You can spray the same amount of neonics on GMO or conventional crops alike. 




 barely beats the 4-door saloon
  
It crushed it in the drag race, and on a track the difference would be even larger.  




 You said this.
  
Well the traditional approach usually limits the amount you spray because it can in turn damage the plant. GMOs are resistant to the pesticides, so they spray a LOT of them.
  
Which has nothing to do with the use of neonicotinoids. GMOs are not to blame at all for CCD.  




 Neonicotinoids are used on both GMO and non-GMO crops, there are no crops genetically engineered to be resistant to neonicotinoid application because neonicotinoids are an insecticide and not a herbicide.

 I was looking into replacing my old MBP with an Air, but the poor netbook quality screen pushed me off.  




 Except the Air uses a shitty TN display.  




 Pesticides known as neonicotinoids are commonly believed to be a contributor to CCD, Monsanto is not a manufacture of these chemicals. Companies such as Bayer and Syngenta are, blaming Monsanto in this case is idiotic. 




 [The link isn't as strong as is commonly claimed.](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0118748) 




 You are being downvoted because you are wrong. 
  
The primary suspected cause of CCD are neonicotinoids which are an insecticide. They are applied to both GMO   non GMO crops alike and its application is not harmful to plants. 
  
Common GMOs are designed to be herbicide resistant or to produce their own pesticides in the form of bt-proteins. BT-proteins are not a suspected contributor to CCD.  




 Except none of Monsanto's products are believed to be a primary contributor to CCD.  




 Don't think any herbicide has been linked to bee die off.

 Though when the authority figure made a direct order to proceed with the experiment 100% of the participants refused to carry on.
  
[Furthermore, close analysis of the experimental sessions shows that participants are attentive to the demands made on them by the Learner as well as the Experimenter [38]. They are torn between two voices confronting them with irreconcilable moral imperatives, and the fact that they have to choose between them is a source of considerable anguish. They sweat, they laugh, they try to talk and argue their way out of the situation. But the experimental set-up does not allow them to do so. Ultimately, they tend to go along with the Experimenter if he justifies their actions in terms of the scientific benefits of the study (as he does with the prod The experiment requires that you continue) [39]. But if he gives them a direct order (You have no other choice, you must go on) participants typically refuse. Once again, received wisdom proves questionable. The Milgram studies seem to be less about people blindly conforming to orders than about getting people to believe in the importance of what they are doing [40].](http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001426)

The data are inconclusive, therefore the claim (ie, conclusion) that Roundup Ready maize NK603 and/or the Roundup herbicide have a link to cancer is unreliable.

EFSA finds that the study as reported by Sralini et al. is of insufficient scientific quality for safety assessments. EFSA concludes that the currently available evidence does not impact on the ongoing re-evaluation of glyphosate and does not call for the reopening of the safety evaluations of maize NK603 and its related stacks.

  Consequently, the HCB Scientific Committee considers that the paper offers no information supporting the existence of a health risk associated with consumption of maize NK603, whether or not treated with a Roundup herbicide formulation.

**Conclusion on study Results**
  
[The significant results obtained before correction are not biologically coherent overall. However, biological data on the results would be needed to draw a definitive conclusion. At this point in time, in light of the information provided in the publication, the ECEAGs experts consider that the authors interpretations are not sufficiently corroborated by the study data. 
Moreover, during the hearing, the studys authors admitted that this study was not conclusive by itself and that, though subject to improvement, it had the merit of opening up an interesting line of research.

**TLDR:** Seralini's 2012 study is full of elementary mistakes and follows an inadequate protocol that fails to support the conclusions he makes. 




 So Monsanto is selling the same seed corn, world wide, which is all genetically identical.
  
They are not the same exact seed. The RR trait is commonly back crossed into existing plant lines, 




 Where in the article does it say that?

 They never made it criminal, they gave no binding voluntary guidelines for labeling back in 2001. 




 Luckily there are no sterile GMO crops on the market.

Yes, but it boils down to what extent of animal exploitation you are comfortable with. Frankly being 100% vegan is close to impossible, but I really wouldn't recommend allowing the perfect to become the enemy of the good.  




 I understand that there is no way to know 100% on anything, but in the case of almonds it's a pretty cut and dry case of being reliant on a domesticated/managed animal.  




 [Almond trees are pollinated by honey bees which are a non-native and domesticated incest which are trucked in from across the country.](http://www.almonds.com/growers/pollination)
  
In total, we observed 2416 flower visits by honeybees Apis mellifera
(70% of all visits), 378 by wild bees of at least 19 species
(11% of all visits), 327 by hover flies (10% of all visits) and 314
by other insects of various taxa (9% of all visits). Other insects
included flies (primarily Bombyliidae and Muscidae), ants
(Formicidae) and other infrequent visitors (Table S1, Supporting
Information). The most flower visits by wild bees were provided
by the ground-nesting sand bee Andrena cerasifolii
(Cockerell) accounting for more than 2% of all flower visits.
Sweat bees also frequently visited flowers, especially an undescribed
Lasioglossum (Evylaeus) species and Lasioglossum incompletum
(Crawford). These wild bees were present only in
orchards with nearby natural habitat. The blue orchard bee
Osmia lignaria propinqua Cresson, a species that could be managed
for almond production in California (Bosch   Kemp
2002), was only observed once.

 I meant you can. Plant patents have existed since the 30's and plant variety protection started in the 70s.  




 You can get a patent or PVP on an already existing crop, now if you modified the plant through conventional breeding or genetic engineering you can get protection on the newly created variety.

 Maybe you should read what you post. Bowman bought outbound grain and used glyphosate to select for Monsanto's trait. His actions were a willful and intentional attempt at avoiding paying Monsanto's licensing fees.  




 Polluting our food supply with their patented genes, and then seizing other farmers' crops when they test positive for those patented genes.

 What poisonous chemicals? 




 aggressively pursue farmers that grow these GMO crops despite the fact that they may spread their progeny naturally for miles around
  
Monsanto has never sued over accidental cross pollination, they only sue over willful and intentional isolation and growing without a licensee. Example being the case cited in Food Inc over Percy Scmeiser.
  
 I'll quote the actual court case.
  
[In late June or early July of 1997, Mr. Schmeiser and his employee Carlyle Moritz hand sprayed Roundup around power poles and in the ditches along the Bruno road where it bordered fields 1, 2, 3 and 4. This was part of his normal weed control practice. Several days after the spraying, he noticed that a large number of canola plants had survived the spraying. To determine why the canola plants had survived the Roundup spraying, Mr. Schmeiser conducted a test in field 2. Using a machine sprayer set to spray 40 feet, he sprayed Roundup on a section of field 2 in a strip along the road. He made two passes, the first weaving between and around the power poles and the second adjacent to the first pass, parallel to the power poles. He testified that by this means he sprayed a good three acres of field 2. According to Mr. Schmeiser's evidence, after some days, approximately 60% of the canola plants sprayed were still alive, growing in clumps that were thickest near the road and thinner as one moved into the field.[23]At harvest time in 1997 Mr. Schmeiser, who was then recovering from a leg injury, instructed Mr. Moritz to swath and combine field 2. Mr. Moritz did so, harvesting the canola in the field as well as the surviving canola along the roadside. The harvested seed was put into the box of a 1962 Ford pickup truck. The box was covered with a tarp and the truck with its tarped load of canola seed was stored in one of Mr. Schmeiser's buildings over the winter.[24]Mr. Schmeiser testified that in the spring of 1998 the seed from the Ford truck was transferred to another truck and taken to the Humboldt Flour Mill for treatment, a normal process to rid the seeds of disease before planting. The treated seed, mixed with untreated seed from his granary ("bin-run seed"), was planted in all or part of each of his nine fields, for a total of 1,030 acres.](http://decisions.fca-caf.gc.ca/en/2002/2002fca309/2002fca309.html)  
  
  
His crop did not magically become 95-98% RR canola purity overnight and the court realized this. Schmeiser was not sued over accidental cross pollination, but over intentionally isolating RR canola plants and planting the seed the following year. 
  
  
There was also the more recent OSGATA V. Monsanto case, in which OSGATA sued Monsanto over aggressive/bullying practices, the judge throughout the case because OSGATA could not prove their claim in court. 
  
  From the Court Case.  
  

[Taken together, it is clear that these circumstances do not 
amount to a substantial controversy and that there has been no 
injury traceable to defendants. We therefore do not have subject 
matter jurisdiction over this action, and it is, accordingly, 
dismissed](http://www.osgata.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/OSGATA-v-Monsanto-MTD-Decision.pdf)
  
Monsanto has actually sold these chemicals knowing that they are toxic both to humans, animals and the environment.
  
You're going to need a citation for this, but I believe you are talking about glyphosate/roundup which is generally safe and poses little harm to humans when properly used.

There was no evidence of a carcinogenic effect related toglyphosatetreatment.

Note that there was a weak but slight association with multiple myeloma that the authors suggest that further follow up is required. Also this was among applicators who inherently are exposed to significantly higher amounts of glyphosate than end product consumers.

  
Also a re-analysis of the AHS data failed to show the same link between glyphosate and multiple meyloma.

Overall in terms of increase yields and decreased pesticide use Bt-cotton has been a significant plus to farmers in India. 
  
  
Also about suing farmers, Monsanto only sues over willful and intentional isolation of their license seed. They don't sue over accidental cross pollination. 
  
Also there is little evidence that Monsanto is aggressively going after farmers. Recently OSGATA a consortium of organic farmers attempted to preemptively sue Monsanto over aggressive actions, but the case failed due to lack of any evidence provided proving the claims against Monsanto were true.

To examine potential cancer risks in humans, we reviewed the epidemiologic literature to evaluate whether exposure to glyphosate is associated causally with cancer risk in humans. We also reviewed relevant methodological and biomonitoring studies of glyphosate. Seven cohort studies and fourteen case-control studies examined the association between glyphosate and one or more cancer outcomes. Our review found no consistent pattern of positive associations indicating a causal relationship between total cancer (in adults or children) or any site-specific cancer and exposure to glyphosate.

 Ignoring the whole "carcinogen" part. You do know you can make herbicide tolerant crops with conventional non GMO techniques.  




 In the 1980s, but there market share has been continuously shrinking with competition from Russian, Canadian,   Australian mining companies.  




 Well, that's what happens when you jump to McLaren.  




 They still do, though the Lamborghini car company and Lamborghini tractor company are no longer the same.  




 This one. 









 Extremely overpriced? Iphones sell for a similar price to other top end phones by Samsung or HTC.  




 They are priced very similar. Both are around 650.  




 Vertu now are running 4.4 and have decent specs for when they were launched.  




 What monopoly?  




 Really? My 09 Macbook Pro still runs beautifully.  




 This is a myth.

 Stephen Ostroff has never worked for Monsanto. 




 Yes that's the current drug form GW Pharmaceutical, but that study was not blinded. It's the next stage that is planned to actually test for efficacy of the drug as a treatment for epilepsy.  




 Just under epilepsy most the the links were 404s and the only one that was at all relevant (blinded) had a really small sample and lack of statistical analysis.  




 How many of those are clinical controlled studies? 




 I'm just happy that my ideas are getting the mainstream attention that they deserve.  




 Alternative medicine is not marketed as a drug because it's illegal to do so the US. Hence why all herbal medicine comes with a disclaimer on the packaging.
  
 




 [I'd be shocked if either grew.](http://www.homedepot.com/catalog/productImages/400/d2/d21d4f32-78f9-4e2a-a3e9-dd99f8ef3057_400.jpg) 




 I disagree, I believe that its the governments responsibility to ensure safe guards when it comes to medication in order to ensure that there is a threshold of safety and efficacy taken into account. I don't believe that we should allow people to peddle snake oil and alternative medicine as scientifically effective treatments.  




 Are you saying those dozens of parents are lying and that it is just coincidental ?

  
Until there is actual controlled data we'll never know. It could be an actual effect, it could be confirmation bias, or it could be a placebo effect.  




 You mean supporting the current law when it comes to all medical drugs?  




 We should ban the marketing, selling, and prescription of herbal home remedies as an effective treatment for disease or illness.  




 I'm not talking about legalization of drugs, I'm talking about the use of a marijuana as medical drug used to effectively treat disease or illness.  




 A therapeutic index of 1. 




 There actually is a clinical trial being conducted at the moment looking into MMJ effect on seizures in children. So far there results look promising but the current completed phase wasn't blinded as it was only looking for safety of the concentrate/extract.  




  Just that things that only feel very good tend to be made more illegal than things just feel ok.

I think this is confirmation bias, for who cares about the things that don't make us feel good that are made illegal.  




 Again, my issue is with the use of it as a medical drug without the proper testing   studies. 
  
I'm ambivalent to its legalization and support removing it from its current DEA schedule 1 status. I'm against using it to treat disease and illness when there is no strong evidence supporting its efficacy.  




 Doctors and mmj clinics are prescribing and selling it as a drug in many states.  




 My stance is simple. MMJ lacks the required clinical evidence to support its use as a drug. Once proper testing is done I'd me fine with it being prescribed by trained professionals. 
  
You are the one who doesn't care about the actual evidence.  




 Yeah, because I desire adequate evidence before I want to see something marketed and sold as a drug.  




 [Citation Needed]  




 No one is claiming that jumping off a sky scraper is going to treat epilepsy.  




 And I agree, the punishments for marijuana use/possession are way to harsh and there is to much control over research of the plant and its chemicals.  




 Again, an anecdotal account is not sufficient evidence to base medical policy off of.  




 I don't believe marijuana is dangerous enough to be classified as a schedule 1 drug.  




 Deciding what drug to use to treat an illness or disease has nothing to do with DEA scheduling.  




 US isn't the only country, and many of these studies have been in the work long before the recent rounds of states legalizing it.
  
I'm not denying that there are too many regulations on the study of cannabis and its chemical derivatives.  




 And hundreds of families have traveled to Texas to be treated by Burzynski "medicine".  




 I don't really care what other people consume, I do care that people are marketing marijuana as an effective drug for treating hundreds of illnesses and disease without strong empirical evidence.  




 I'm not saying marijuana is bad for you, only that the evidence that supports its use as an effective medicine is weak.  




 GW Pharmaceutical is running trials in the US looking into cannabis as a treatment for epilepsy in children. They also have already put to market a cannabis based medication for the treatment of MS in Europe, and there are several trials looking into using it in cancer patients.  




 Nope, I just want some strong empirical evidence stemming from controlled clinical trials before I'm comfortable with selling anything as a drug. 




 Typo, I meant enema 
  
http://www.cancer-treatment-tips.com/coffee-enema.html 




 It's not, there are several on going trials as we speak.  




 Most illnesses that mmj is claimed to treat aren't support by controlled clinical trials. This is a fact. 




 We have anecdotal evidence that coffee edemas cure cancer and vaccines cause autism. Thank god we don't base medical decisions off these accounts. 




 You are making the assumption that this treatment is actually effective at treating seizures.  




 It's a lack of clinical controlled studies, the same threshold that any other new drug has to meet before it can be sold as a drug.  




 Studies are being done. 




 I'm against the current use of MMJ, from the lack of strong clinical data showing its efficacy to how it's administered/prescribed.  




 Self reported study and a case report. 
  
There is ample evidence to support further research of cannabis into treating epilepsy in children, but the evidence today is far short of supporting it as a proven medical treatment.  




 How? Evidence for the effectiveness of MMJ is lacking for many illnesses it is claimed to cure. Just because people have been using marijuana for "decades" doesn't make up for the lack of empirical evidence.  




 There's actually a current study going on that is looking into the effects of a MMJ extract on epilepsy in children.
  
[So far they have tested for safety of the extract and they are moving onto effectiveness of the treatment soon.](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/04/150413183743.htm) 




 No it doesn't.  




 It's not about not understanding the MoA, it's that most of MMJ health benefits are based on anecdotal accounts that are akin to snake oil and other alternative medicine.  




 This is what I believe, except it wasn't Cheney but NASA. For NASA was hiding the official tapes on how they faked the moon landing in the WTC, the Pentagon, and some random field in Pennsylvania.  




 Get out of bed and drag a comb across my head.

 All GMOs can go to seed and non-GMOs can be patented.  




 Basically you have either glyphosate or glufosinate tolerant genetically engineered crops. But you also have non GE crops that have been made herbicide resistant to herbicides such as sulfonylurea and imidazolinone.
