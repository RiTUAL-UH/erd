 those classes aren't about actually learning art. they're about having fun and that's exactly what this guy did. 




 it makes no sense to me that everybody on here is claiming they have no problem with growth hormone and then simultaneously downvoting you for saying you wish it were socially acceptable. 




 his point is that nobody can deny that steroids are taboo among the vast majority of people and he's definitely right. he's just saying he wishes it wasn't the case and all you people are advocating hgh and then downvoting this guy for saying he wishes it were socially acceptable and that makes absolutely no sense regardless of where you stand on the issue.

 reminded me of the automatic pilot from Airplane 




 First off, I got my car brand new. this is in response to the guy who followed the car thief because he recognized the car from Facebook. Do people still steal newer cars? Can you get around the system and get different plates or if the theif sells, does the buyer then just drive the car unregistered to his name because I would think when you register it they'd catch you. I can't understand how stealing a car is worth the trouble.

 You are goddamn right. 




 THATS MY FUCKING COMMENT. BlockoManWINS is my other account.  




 think of it this way. when you have no friends you can wear a cloak out in public and not have to worry what people think. honestly cloaks look warm and comfortable as fuck. 




 I don't understand why your comment is acceptable and mine is not 




 got a place near there. I will definitely be keeping my eyes peeled! 




 infiniti logo is not just a circle with a triangle missing. it's a road going off into the distance. another obvious thing that took me ages to notice.

 there's no way this car is real. it's too beautiful. definitely just an urban legend.

 I made a sticky and sparten did a self post. everyone who bothered to respond liked it. 




 can confirm. One of those was me. 




 I'm not saying what he did was ok but you literally cannot mention his name now without an army of self righteous fucks suddenly pretending that they are above being upset about this. he was the carpet in the Big Lebowski. he held the show together which is why he did all the celebrity interviews. we are all sad that top gear as we know it is gone and it's oh so reassuring to me that people are so quick to demonize someone that they loved for so long. I'm done arguing about this. 




 so ALL those years of entertainment he gave you mean nothing because he made one mistake. because you're perfect and have never made a mistake. got it. 




 how about next time you leave constructive criticism instead of being passive aggresive

 I could see aquaman driving that 




 it was from a  post about sports so manly that they aren't in the Olympics or something. the guy is standing on a plank of wood being pulled by a 2 cowpower engine through some mud. the Scottish tree throwing thing was in there too.

 yeah with creepy statues and like... poems carved into trees. would be so cool 




 there are a couple issues with the font. text fields for submitting posts and the drop-down menu for "my subreddits" are too light so the font is hard to see. if I post the code will someone take a look at it?

 I tried to do that to mine and hed pee in the litter box but then hed perk his ears and launch himelf out, kicking litter everywhere, and sprint up to my roommates door where hed leave a pile of poo and just lay. I think he was just a jerk. 




 I watched a couple of them and he is extremely annoying. everything he says is redundant. it's a shame because I really like the videos otherwise 




 aw you jerks I just saw this today and was going to post it 
























 if I ever go bald I am going to march right over to gods house and take a poo on his sofa. 




 my dad was a weaver

 and now that dad is in jail nothing can take that away from us! 




 I won't claim to know how an octopus tank size effects its stress level I'm just saying that its intelligence won't have anything to do with the argument. it's a sedentary animal so if all its needs are accounted for it will stay put whereas a tang is highly energetic. it's like having a small apartment and putting a sleepy dog vs a nutty dog in it. they could be the same breed but the nutty one will be stressed and the sleepy one won't be bothered. 




 how does that make any sense? an animals territory size is in no way related to its intelligence. the only reason an octopus moves at all is to find food or mate. 




 I have an exam tomorrow and I'm going to get less than 5 hours of sleep thanks to OP. ain't even mad. 




 I'm down. let's bring a bunch of booze and figure out a way to turn this into the ultimate drinking game?

 I shall die in a pool of vomit, convulsing on the floor from heart failure but happy nonetheless 




 awww thank you sweetie I love me too :) 




 I'm going to make these for me because I love me so much :) 




 bb I'm bout to plug dis dongle in and charge u RIGHT up (    ) 




 and then a cartoon series based on the toy 




 how does this relate? particle accelerators are not that hard to understand. In fact I will explain to you right now how they work: shit is magic. 




 could you not? id like to keep my methods on the down low until it's published. 




 actually mammatus comes from the same root as mammary because these clouds looked like boobs to whoever named them. 




 I don't understand people like you. that's literally 1 bite of food. I have friends who will eat a hamburger and leave the LAST bite to waste and it makes me go ape shit. 




 it didn't smell at all it was just the taste. it's one of those things that I can see why people would like it but for the price id rather just have tuna or tako 




 marinade it first. delicious. 




 go to Greek Islands and try their octopus. it is absolutely phenomenal. my mom tells me that when I was a kid I refused to eat anything except pb j, hamburgers, and cold octopus salad 




 no way man the texture was great but it tastes the way a tidepool smells. oddly charming but all in all just bad. 




 an identified driving object? 




 my brain is struggling to turn that into a sex joke 




 incorrect. train_subject6359 shifts significantly faster with an average shift time of approximately 0ms. some say he shifts so fast that his lap times are negative. 




 I don't know that there is a wrong way to use it. 




 was he doing curls on the calf machine and going TSATT. HUNNNHHHH with every rep because if so I think you nailed it. 




 go buy as many lottery tickets as you can afford. someone upstairs has your back today. 




 I did a study the other day which conclusively proved that I don't like diet soda as much as I like regular soda and therefore regular is better. still waiting to hear back from the new England journal of medicine. 




 oooh ooh ooh that's a party foul. I wish you hadn't pointed that out. this is amazing otherwise. 




 the high rev is absolutely beautiful but I can't decide if my love for it outweighs my disdain for loud idling.

 that god damn thing is already louder than my 500w amp

 he's been living in the desert under a rock, watching reruns of 90s sitcoms no doubt. 




 because his light was about to turn green so in my haste I didnt realize the diglet was blocking part of the camera 









 just stop. nobody wants you here.

 maybe he's in Australia so when it turns upside down its actually right side up? 




 frankly I'm not sure 




 but who will clean the cleaner of the cleaner? 




 dead like your social life 




 people on reddit will go ape shit for the 800th ok looking girl to put a chicken on her shoulder but when a guy like you decides to poke fun at how tired this lame fucking joke is, you get torn apart for being bald. today is the day I unsubscribe.

 oops. dammit 









 creepy is not synonymous with scary. the way she moves has an uncanny valley effect and it is kind of creepy imo

edit: *necessarily* synonymous* 




 how many hours of planning did that take I wonder. and it even hits the target 









 9000 acres of land or ONE lamborghini veneno. seriously what the fuck. 




 ouch my wallet hurts 




 to my pearly jawfish. What the hell happened to you? I pulled up all the rocks and searched every crevice in the carpet and not a trace. I like to imagine he eloped with a babe he met on the internet. 




 I GET THIS REFERENCE. guys I got this one. did you see? 




 Anthony bourdain (bordaine? bordain?) did a special on Copenhagen in Parts Unknown. one of the most unique food specials I have ever seen!!

let me guess... PhD in philosophy 




 I want to see a gif of her being fed. oh OH and put a little underwater top hat on her! 
























 You could have a separate LaFerrari for each day of the week with that kind of cash. Assuming Ferrari would allow it. 




 This is why I always poo before driving. Takes about 4 seconds off my sprint time and adds about 20mpgs. On your marks, get set, science. 




 You might like this [v12 Fiat 500](https://youtu.be/GH2uwjk3fqM). If you look at related videos you can find the build process. I couldn't help but chuckle at the popup spoiler. 




 Because the two people trying to convince everyone that this is a ripoff are doing so based on an imgur link and refusing to provide a link to the original artists webpage. 




 He is a modern day Franz Liszt. Taking it to 11 and beyond. I bet all the bitches be swooning over his intellect. 




 If you look close you can see soft tissue. Little tentacles. Definitely still alive I'd say. 




 A bivalve! My roommate had one in his tank back when it was FOWLR. He was so proud of it. It was surprisingly active always moving to a new spot every couple days. 




 Gives new meaning to the phrase "Happy as a pig in a Tupperware thing of water" 




 Looks like its straight out of Hotrod or Napoleon Dynamite 




 Woah woah just because she has feathers on her head you assume she meant native american? As someone who is easily offended, I am offended. 




 HEY GUYS WE GOT A PEDO OVER HERE 




 Side hustle: president of mars 




 I was half expecting it to just come exploding out of the newspaper 




 You can tell just from the style that it isn't going to be funny 




 A minute thirty of my life for 2 mini revs. 




 Everyone was thinking it but its not socially acceptable to say 




 I like how the bmer (and that poorly timed white truck) is the only thing in the entire photo that's in focus. 




 Its all like (o_o  ) 




 That black bottom panel accents its hips so well 









 Oh I thought your mother produced you by binary fission. 




 Ambien. Probably more than once 




 He can talk to animals. I hear he sips Stella with silverbacks when he's bored 




 Those prefreckles tho 




 I don't know why but I absolutely love that pointy little ducktail on the huracans butt 




 (  _) 




 My name is Ra. Can confirm I wouldn't reincarnate those fucks. 




 Its too small for 1 let alone 2. 




 Cats just don't appreciate awd 




 [Pacuman?](http://i.imgur.com/2D6xUuU.gif) 




 One theory says it was sort of like a university. Maybe they just didn't need it anymore 




 [Probably this](http://imgur.com/DXRdukO) 




 I can't count that high but I agree 




 Was this like 2 days ago? I had an early exam in the burbs and the fog was absolutely bananas. 




 The money funds ecological and anti-poaching programs too. Or at least thats what they say. 




 I love fish's dopey faces. None compare to a good ol fashioned lawnmower blenny though. 




 Thats only true if the car is completely submerged. I can't tell of the front window was open but if it was, the pressure would equalize and you'd be able to open the back door.  




 Id remove the blue background ASAP but I like this! Its weirdly charming. Especially if it had some tiny shrimp  




 I spotted a pretty rare Porsche the other day (Chicago) and some German guy was like oh yeah everyone's bringing those out now that its warming up. But now the tables have turned. 




 I thought so too but I've never seen one that color and without the big front eyes 




 He was holding his front legs up like antennae. Brown body with white hairs so he looked matte white 









 I consider myself a connoisseur of quisine so maybe I can help you out. The first is shrimp eggs. The second is some kind of blackened fish? The third is ummm... a brown... loaf. Yes, a brown loaf with green stuff on it. And the fourth is a bunch of vegetables in like a broth or something. 




 Hydroids 




 I actually posted this here earlier and it got downvoted. I'm glad it ended up here regardless because IMO its gold 




 Hey i totally agree. anyone with artistic skills can do realism from a reference photo. It takes creativity and originality to do design without being cliche. I actually like those a lot. 









 You have a cool life 




 A tin of shisha, hopefully 




 Jewel has handles of vodka for $11. FULL HANDLES. For a chronically stressed, almost broke medical student this is a dream come true. 




 Once you get the hang of it they're actually really precise. I used to use mine to bother my dog. Used to. 




 There are a couple other creepy ones on my [website](http://www.studioralu.com) if that's what you're into

 I'd take my kids the fuck to school in that. I like it a lot. 




 I caught one disappearing around the corner in the garage I park in when I go to the city. Not sure if it was a 6 or an 8 but that thing sounds like a choir of snarling cat-angels. Almost brought tears to my eyes. 




 I'm a brofessor. I drink beers and pretend I know what im talking about 




 That exhaust. I bet it sounds mean 




 I saw your post in r/new and thought I was going crazy for a minute 




 Yeah Da Vinci was a no good lousy imitator too. All he did was copy Mona Lisa's face with oil paints.  




 Warp me in dude its miserable here in Chicago today. 









 Actually I'm pretty sure its called an "and thingy" 




 That is disturbing, Kate. I wonder what the science behind it is 




 reliable minotaur

My friend hired a minotaur without bothering to check its references first. Within a week, a burglar broke in and stole his adamantine tunic. Was a family heirloom too. Do your homework folks. 




 Seen one in my Chicagoland neighborhood. Black with gold calipers ( o  o ) 




 Try an osteopath for musculoskeletal stuff. Their practice revolves around it. 




 Bro I appreciate this joke twice as much as you and that's when I'm not even trying. 




 I'd eat so many m ms with that bad boy. Not even because I'm hungry but just because its cool. 




 Friends, i fear OP is kill. 




 A 




 Everything is a penis if you look with your heart 




 Yesss I'm 20 min from bolingbrook! I'm gonna go find a car I like and tell strangers that I own it. 




 [Are you *salty* about it?](http://i.imgur.com/LSxJe.png) 




 Not to mention those incomparable interiors ( o . o ) 




 Do you not realize that YOURE a shitty enthusiast? There is nothing wrong with driving a Camry or a corolla. They're sensibly priced and fairly reliable.  




 True that. My first car was a shitty 95 integra and my second was a pretty nice 2005 TL. The integra was a blast because I always felt like I could die at any minute. The TL was a bit boring in comparison. 




 Looks like its past someone's bedtime 




 Having a car that you think looks like crap is awesome. You can park anywhere you want, drive carefree, and leave it on the street without worrying about teenagers fucking with it. I miss my beat up 95 integra sometimes. 




 Constricted 




 How dare you post Stlenhag without personally alerting me. You knew he was my favorite. 




 If this car is legal then why are the boner police arresting me just for looking at it? 




 Yeah the blue squiggles one was weirdly satisfying. OP should title it "toothpaste thingies" 




 That goddamn sacrotuberous ligament 




 Also interesting: your fingers have no muscle in them. Flexors and extensors are all the way in the forearm and side-to-side-ers are in the hand. 




 Dissecting the hand and foot was a pain in the ass but not as big a pain in the ass as dissecting the ass. 




 dad you're drunk 




 If I was in a room with Adam Levine, Hitler and Satan and I had a gun with 2 bullets I'd shoot Adam Levine twice 




 He's going through and rating everyone less than a 5 and getting downvotes every time 




 Inspired by True Detective 




 $20 and my firstborn 




 Probably woahdude or imaginarymonsters 




 Absolutely! Check out my website at www.train_subject6359.com. all my work + email address is on there 




 He is awesome. I wish I could afford oils and just blatantly rip off some of his haha 




 Shopped. I can tell by the pixels. Right guys? 




 OP neglected to include a picture of him creating the universe. /r/karmaconspiracy 




 hey! I don't have a gallery. im in school so I don't have the time or money to really set anything up. glad you like it though :) 




 it's a joke 




 I had one, also last night, that a rat was trying to burrow into my stomach and as hard as I tried I couldn't get away. Shit hurt so bad. Now you know where your bred rats are going. 









 I clicked it and then switched tabs and at first an Oreos jingle came on and I was like "what the hell is wrong with this guy." But you're right the music does go pretty well! 




 ahahah i love it!
