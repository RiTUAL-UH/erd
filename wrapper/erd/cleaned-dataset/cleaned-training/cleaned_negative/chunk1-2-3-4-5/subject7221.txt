 I installed successfully an Mac OS X 10.10 Yosemite in my Dell Optiplex 780 with GeForce GT 430 through Clover.
Only using loadvbios option. 




 Just uninstall beta and remove rpetri.ch repo. The 1.9.1 version of Activator will show in search. 




 At the 1.9.2 beta 1 (reading the changelog) seems that the Touch ID force was disabled by the dev Ryan Petrich... It means that is not possible use it without an event. I dont understand why (possibly battery drain). 




 Nobody fucks with the Jesus. 




 Its a bug with Activator within the new update (1.8.4~rc1 at Ryan Petrich repo)... I think it will be corrected after new update in a few days. 




 Moranguinho desastrado.

 Natively only Air Print ready printers are supported in iOS. TruPrint was a tweak that make possible send to a big number of network printers, but its devs didnt update since iOS6.

The PDF printer for Safari (never was natively, only inside apps) at Cydia dont work with iOS 7, wait for an update too. 




 Well, it would be so much usefull, the tweaks that support those functionality are not compatible with ios 7. 




 It could be nice! air print ready printers are so few...
