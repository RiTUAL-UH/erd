 Hi everyone!

I wanted to ask all of you about how many kits from this season of Build Fighters Try you think will be released. From the first season we got 17 HG kits plus the MG kits still being released/ to be released. How many do you think we'll get from the second season? Cheers! 
























 We're already 20 episodes in and we have yet to see Sei, Reiji, Aila, or Fellini. What do you guys think? Will we see our favorite characters before the season ends? Thanks! :) 
























 I get what you're saying, but if that was the case, why even bother bringing in Ral, Allan, Meijin, and Lucas (all characters from the first season) in the first place?   
























 With the announcement of the OVAs, do you guys think we'll get a season 3 at some point? Producer Masakazu Ogawa said they were taking a "rest" for the time being, but do you think we'll get a season 3? Excited for the OVAs nonetheless. RAGE ON GUNPLA!!! 
























 Where exactly does he say they've declined? He says they're taking a break, not that they're not going to make a season 3.
