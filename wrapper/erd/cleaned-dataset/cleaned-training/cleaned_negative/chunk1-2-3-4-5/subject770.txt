 I have 1 friend I met trough gaming wich i still have contact with but we have met irl and have different stuff to talk about besides gaming, so that is no problem. And yes, some of my friends game and I have no problem with them gaming when I'm around, however, I will always stay on the background instead of joining in (In a FIFA competition on ps3 by example) 




 These are actually really good questions to ask yourself if you're afraid you might have a computer problem, thank you! 




 I never said that drugs and gaming are the same thing, drugs are bad, very bad, they destroy people's life so often while gaming is entertainment, so many people enjoy it. How could it be the same? Well, it can destroy lives aswell, believe me. Not in the way drugs do but in more subtile forms, you start to ignore the ones you love, they get frustrated.. You become unhealthy, hardly see people.. This of course will not happen when you are a casual gamer and there is nothing wrong with that, I cannot stress that enough. But there are times where it goes way beyond that, where you really need professional help in order to get way from it's grip.

This seems very weird to alot of people because they assume you can just 'stop gaming' and it's 'lack of self control'. Well, you can just 'stop drinking' too right? No.. Gaming does not indeed reward you in a fysical or material way like drug or alcohol do but sometimes, with certrain people, the rush of winning, the feeling that it gives, can be just as addicting as gambling I am sure. I'm not the worst case by far, I've seen people in the clinic go bonkers because they were denied internet access. 

I understand that all this must seems really weird for outsiders, incomprehensable even, but let me assure you, it can be really bad and it is in fact, considered a legitimate addiction by authoroties and such. 




 I would say that before anything, just like with every other addiction, you have to realise yourself that you spend way too much time on computers and need to stop. If not, nothing or nobody can help. Once you realised this it's best to seek professional advice, they will explain everything to you and then it's up to you wether to decide if you want help or not. Just one more thing, don't think 'I'm going to calm down on gaming, going to game less.' No. Just, NO. That doesn't work, you have to quit everything, cold turkey and try to last as long as possible. Because if you play 'a bit' you'll fall back into old patters before you know. 




 The irony of me doing this IAmA did not escape me either :) 




 There are alot of people who think the same as you, so did I actually. But it had been proven that you can actually be addicted to internet usage or gaming in the same way that you're addicted to by example drugs or alcohol. I went to a clinic in Holland (there aren't any (good) ones in Belgium who are specialised in this matter) where they only treat this kind of addiction, there they diagnosed me and offered to treat me but i didn't want to be internated, I wanted to get over it on my own, with the help of my doctor and parents. So far, it seems to have worked. 




 I'de have to say i was the most addicted to CoD:MW2 the most, the hours I played on that.. It was really bad. Sc2 and War of Legend (a short period, but really heavy) have been bad for me aswell. 




 Because I was going to start in Computer Science that year and I needed a good laptop to run all the software smoothly. Turns out it ran all the games smoothly aswell, not good.. And I played random so: 1/3rd For the Overmind!! I guess..:p 




 In what way do you want me to provide proof? 




 I know the feeling all too well. I think something along those lines would have applied to me aswell. Luckely, I liked sleep too much to actually get up early to game wich kept me atleast a bit healthy but still, it was pretty bad from time to time. There were weeks in the winter where I realised I haven't seen the sun in days, I was basically living during nightime and blocked out the little sun there was. 




 Yes I have, and I actually did. This was on my old laptop, instead of removing everything I bough a new one (an Alienware, stupid me) and told myself I wouln't install games anymore. This lasted for maybe 3 days and made me realise afterwards that I indeed have a problem.

No, I never got to GM but I've been Top-8 Masters frequently, I think I played too much CoD to actually get promoted (I was #1 5v5 in the esl for almost a year, this made me some money in online tournaments but this was more bad then good, since I used it as an excuse to keep playign since 'I made money with it') 




 Yes, it really is. This is the longest I've been on it in weeks just because I force myself to leave after 15 minutes each session. I love this site but it's so big and there's an endless flow of interesting stuff to find and peers to discuss with that if I wouldn't force myself to get off the PC, I would fall right back into my old lifestyle. But I really wanted to do this IAmA so I cut myself some slack :) 




 I don't exactly how or what made me realise I was addicted but suddently I started seeing that the people around me were right and I was actually spending way too much time gaming and on the internet and I decided that this is not the life I wanted to live. So I packed my bags and went to France for the entire summer with a few mates, spent our days surfing and such but I tried to refrain myself form any form of internet usage. When I got back I forced myself to stay away from the PC as much as possible and that's a battle with myself I still have to fight every day. And like I said, I started working, travel as much as possible, mostly for surfing. And the biggest thing probably, I found a girlfriend who lives a simular lifestyle, alot of travelling and such and that keeps me away from falling back into old habits. 




 Nee, Knokke :) 




 It's hard to tell to what degree since I always refused any kind of treatment or professional help. In the beginning because I tough I wasn't addicted at all, afterwards because I wanted to stop on my own. But it was pretty bad, I would wake up and start gaming just about untill I went to bed, the only thing I would do besides that was go out with friends or see my girlfriend, no classes, nothing. So I don't really know, pretty bad but not bad enough for me not to want personal contact anymore, or see my friend. 
For the 2nd part of the question, yes, I have experienced pain in my wrists (CoD and Sc2 aren't the most kind games for them) but they seem to have dissapeared now, thank God. 




 I didn't downvote you, it was a legitimate question, hence why I answered it. 




 Good question, this was hard at first, because every free moment I got, I felt that urge to play again. But I started working this year and have found some salvation if you like in surfing, I surf quite alot now, also got my coaching diploma. Basically, I try to occupy myself as much as possible with just about everything and it seems to work out. 




 Actually no, I have had a few good, stable relationships. I don't think I'm bad looking and have gotten quite good ad hiding my internet usage over the years. 









 yeah, I really didn't think this post trough I believe. However, it's almost impossible to keep results like this off the front page :(

 As a Protoss player, here is how I see the situation now:

 Thanks alot mate! Just don't expect too much of it ;) 




 Sent you a replay with Twitter, would love it if you got around reviewing it. I'm a bronze P player altough I consider myself slightly above bronze, somewhere around high silver I think, I just don't play enough. All my matches are against high(er) silver players. Thanks! 





























 Hi,

I used to have an iPhone 4s and all push notifications (Facebook, Twitter, Skype etc..) were delivered instantly to my phone. Same thing goes for my mails. I recently bought an iPhone 5 and made it a copy of my 4s but push notifcations come in with a great delay or not at all, untill I open the app. I also noticed I'm being logged out of apps more often.
Does anyone have an idea how to fix this? Make the notifications/messages/mails instant again? Because this is rather annoying. Thanks alot!! 














 Yes, this is the right size, thank you! Too bad the resolution isn't better but this is almost perfect, thanks alot! 




 This is in the perfect direction! Would love the resolution a bit bigger tough, using this as a Timeline Cover would look blurry. But thanks a ton already! 




 So, as mentioned, I would love to use this picture http://www.ilikewallpaper.net/iphone-5-wallpaper/Longboard-Girl/5972, as my FB Timeline Cover but it was an iPhone wallpaper so is way too high. I would love to see it/her shopped into a fitting enviroment or something, with the dimensions being good for FB. 

Thanks to everyone helping me! Willing to offer a small reward if I really like it!

 Alot of stuff on the Deep Web, in particular CP. Especially the way those people talk about kids just creeps me out, they act like it all normal.. 




 Yes, what mdbjd said was correct, Riot has been criticised often because they tend to fall back on nerfing something they feel is too strong, rather then trying to balance it in another way, making alot of the campions feel the same and damaging the diversity. 




 I have got a Razor Blackwidow and I must say, I'm extremely satisfied with it. Not because of any changes in my play really (the keyboard is of course more then perfect for gaming) but just the way it feels when you type, the sound and the feel with every keystroke, nothing comes close imo. Once you go mech, you'll never go back :) 




 So there's just a forth of a pixel? 




 Yeah, not all roles are correct, just made as an example. And you wouln't be forced to put it there but you could, if you chose so.. 




 I think this would be a gread addition because I believe lesser known streams will have a higher chance of attractiong new viewers. Say for example, I main ADC so that's what I prefer to watch. Now, none of the 'big ADC names' is streaming, what I usually do is watch someone else 'famous', wether he plays my role or not.

Now, if this were to be added, I might click a guy I never heard of before just because I'de like to learn from him, and when I like him, I'll probably come back.
So, this will, in my opinion, give more exposure to the lesser known streamers. What do you guys think?

 Hey, I mentioned, when I launch LoL server status says undefinded, however, when I check the website, it says all servers are up. Is it just me or is anyone else having this? Also, if anyone has a fix, most welcome! Thanks 




 IMPORTANT: Subtitle language can be changed in the bottom left! 









 I have a suggestion. Keep the light in order not to make things complicated but make it so then when you actually revive, it kinda looks like the Prayer-cape emote from Runescape if anyone's familiar with that. That would look so sick imo

 This.. Actually, I don't even know if I'de want to know. 
Actually, yeah I do..:p 




 Okay, I'll try to explain this the best way I can (note that English is not my native language). I've been thinking about how awesome/usefull it would be to see all the stats about your life, just for information/entertainment purposes or comparing to others. 
This would go from basic stuff like amount of food consumed, exact time lived, hours slept etc to really specific/weird stuff like times mastrubated, reddits read, high fives given..

Would love to hear you guys' opinions about this and what would be the n1 stat you want to see for your life?

 I worked in a pretty large fish-shop who sells to alot of restaurants. Whenever someone new guy came my boss would send them all the way to the ocean to go and get 'salt water for the lobster'. Everybody, and I mean everybody did this. Just imagine the hilarity when you see them coming back, dragging just gallons of seawater..:D 




 Thanks for the responses! However, I don't really follow Riot in their decision, not having a system like that just makes for the most ridiculous games form wich, imo, you don't learn a whole lot. It should be easier to, by example, tell the bots where to go from the start, so atleast you can decide for yourself in what team you want to play etc :) 




 Not a troll question, recently played a bot game again after a long time and I was surprised they still are retarded when it comes to lane mate. I made a team with me as Graves and then Sona, Warwick, Malazhar and Garen I believe. You would assume me both with Sona, WW jungle (but since bots don't 'jungle', him top with garen), and Malazhar mid.
Now, what happens when I start the game, I see Sona run top with Warwick, Malazhar bot with Garen leaving the mid lane for me.
Now my question, is it really that hard to make bots have some sense of awereness of where to go? I'm sure I'm not the only one who noticed this..

TLDR; Bot games are meant to learn noobs how to play but how can they when they don't come near real game compositions? Is it so hard to learn bots where to go? 




 Teemo is not OP, het gets countered just like any champ, quit the QQ'ing.

 Scared the crap out of me the first time they used it. I like the idea of a voice saying 'GG' at the end of a match, just not that voice.. 




 Thank you guys for all the answers, things are alot more clear now! Keep playing!:) 




 Allright, first of all, I haven't been playing this game for too long now (level 20-ish) and usually play AD carry (graves, ezreal, teemo etc..) Since the beginning I've been playing with first heal-ghost and later heal-flash as soon as I had it. Now, lately more and more people told me to switch heal for ignite. Granted, almost everyone runs ignite these days. But for me, it just doesn't seem right; I feel like as if heal helped me out loads more in games then ignite. And there are so many close call situations in wich I tough, if only i had me heal there instead of ignite. A feeling I hardly get the other way around..

Now, my question is, is it really that bad to run heal? Should I just keep using ignite till I get used to it? Thanks alot! 




 I agree, I don't want to generalise but it does seem like the majority of drama and bullshit is coming from the NA ladder and it's players. Makes me wonder.. 




 Blizzard please buff Ezreal to fix this!! 




 Why does everyone seem to dislike Teemo so much? 












































 For me it had to be when I saw this kid, must of been like 12 or something, come out of the store with his dad holding a pack of cookies. He looked really happy with them. Then he saw a homeless guy and his dog sitting near the entrance of the shop. 
He stopped, hesitated for a second and then went up the guy, giving him his cookies. He also asked if he could pet the dog, I could see the dad wasn't to excited about that but let him proceed. He then walked away with an even bigger smile, as if he knew what he had just done was nicer then wat I'de say 75% of adults would ever do.
Really brightened up my day.

 Hi,
So I recently upgraded to iTunes 11. Everything went great for a day or 2 but ever since then, iTunes just doensn't open anymore. I tried everything, re-installing, opening as admin, giving priority, deleted iTunes and all sub-components, cleaned registries and reinstalled. Same problem tough, just doesn't want to open..

When I try to launch it and have task manager open, it actually shows up in the list of processes, only to dissapear after a second or 5, never showing the iTunes screen or pictogram in the system bar. 
Could anyone help me please? Thanks alot!!

 This is actually very true, well said 




 No need to upvote, just wanted to tell this..

Important: I'm not a native english speaker and I will try to make this nuanced as possible.

IHonestly, 've wasn't a huge fan of Idra, he was once one of the best zergs out there but then eventually just got passed by others. Nothing bad there, but he kept his 'BM' behaviour and 'I'm the best out there attitude', something wich I tought was a pretty dumb thing to do with no results to back that up. I tough that he would just keep on sinking, trying to survive on the name he once made for himself. 

Now, I must say tough, I was really impressed the last few times I've seen him play on stage, he seems to have really dedicated himself on reaching the top level again. Wich was partially what made me open his stream this evening when I was bored. There, I was pleasently surprised, I found a well-playing Idra, explaing his tactics to his viewers, interacting and not calling people bad every 5 seconds. I really enjoyed it and even felt bad for him and the other viewers when he had to stop streaming because someone tought it would be funny to do the Clan Invite glitch thing.

Just an honest story I wanted to get out there.

TLDR: Idra improved and cleaned up his act imo, best of luck for him in the future.

 1. Often our team will be destroyed when an opposing Katarina is fed, I main adc and feel like there's little to nothing I can do to stop that single-handed. Is there anything I can do?

2. In most of my games I win my lane pretty convincingly but after that it feels like it's up to the team wether we win or not because often teammates lose their lane and I'm not good enough to carry by myself. As long as they don't lose, we tend to win but if they lose their I often get dived 1st thing in the teamfight by a 10-kill fed bruiser/assasin and get wrecked before I can deal dps. TLDR: How can I improve in 'carrying' my team more if I won my lane and they lost theirs?

 That, that and that girl are into you, you're into them. Make a bloody move 




 Would love to hear some opinions about this because I have pulled this trick aswell when I was younger, claiming I was sick to skip school or for whatever reason. The doctor usually came by and always declared me sick for a few days after heaving heard me symptoms and doing a brief check. Now I wonder if they knew I was faking but just played along (they got payed anyhow..) or because it's out of safety 'what if he really is sick, I don't notice it and something bad happens.

Hope this explanation makes sense, english is not my native language. Thanks for the replies!

EDIT: Holy.. Front page, thank you all! 




 Riot pls 




 So you don't want us to look yet you post it on reddit? I'm confused.. 









 Happen to know wich one that is? Thanks 




 As always, expect OP to deliver

 Fuck those cross-eyed rice-shitters and everything around them, backwards country, polluting the earth, not giving a shit about the enviroment, other countries, human or animal rights. Disgusting 




 I once was home alone and gaming with my headset on, about 1 am,  volume pretty loud. Suddently tought I heard a noise coming from downstairs but I tought it was nothing (we have 2 cats aswell, they tend to make some noises now and then) but the, after about a minute, heard it again.
So I put off my headset, listened carefully and aboutt 5 seconds later heard glass breaking. My first tought was still, bloody cats, bumping glass off tables. Went downstairs without turning on lights in the hallway and when I get downstairs I can see trought the living room window 2 guys, each with rocks, throwing in the glass kitchen door.
Sneak upstairs while calling the police, telling them very briefly what's going on, taking my dad's katana he keeps next to his bed and go downstairs again. Now they do see me as I enter the living room and flee. Cops then arrived, made a report but were not too happy about me getting the sword and going downstairs again. 
What I can understand, at that moment tough, I was so angry because I envisioned not me (21y old male) but one of my little sisters being home alone and them breaking in that I was enfuriated. Sorry for the wall of text

**TL; DR: Was gaming,heard noises, tought it was cats, turned out to be burglars trying to smash in the kitchen window.** 




 When should this be implemented? Anyone have an idea? Thanks
