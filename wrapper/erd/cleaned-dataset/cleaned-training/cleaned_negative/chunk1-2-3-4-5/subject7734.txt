 It could also be your own song you recorded so lets hear it. 




 One dude brought us out on the deck and sparked a joint, the other dude bought us a round and I bought some appetizers. It was one of those fucking great afternoons where everything seems great. Ya hear that? Shit is okay today! and I didnt black out during it. Now, from here on in at my own place is a different story. 




 If you can please tell me how it helped. What was the change? 









 What could have it been?

EDIT: or Providence 




 These things are really starting to come in.  




 I have seen many shooting stars but this thing was freaking close.  















































































 For example: Do you have arachnophobia and been stuck in a spider web with spiders all around? You hate wasps? Ever stepped on a nest? How did your body react? Did you freeze, pass out etc...? Can we please hear your stories...if you are able to recount them without too much pain to yourself? 
























 Any fans in ct?

 My mother has been in the hospital since thursday. Her aortic valve has to be replaced. She is getting older and not able to work as much. I help out as much as I can but I was told of a state program that can help with this. Does anyone know of this? I have searched but the state websites are like greek to me. Any help is greatly appreciated. 










































































 No, seriously. 





























 Personally, I get to create and produce any kind of meal I want for breakfast and lunch. Tell me your perks and what you do. 




















































































 Such great words. 




 I'm not sure what can be done to help but please let us know. 




 If we can somehow wipe this fucker out that would be great. This means no publicity via photo or any speculation on reasons. If you are on twitter please chime in with #avowtothepress Lets make sure the press can see this. 





























 Show your face! 





































































 I have found that it works fine. It singles out the action at hand and I don't have to see the persons couch or car lights. Are you all pissed just because? 




 Over this past weekend I uploaded a [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJ4J-c1We-s) of my friends' dog dancing to The Miami Sound Machine. First as a [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/13ndm0/my_dog_has_a_meltdown_when_i_give_her_a_beggin/c75jfpa) and then as it's own [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/13nlmy/my_friends_dog_decided_to_dance_today_for_some/). I posted it at night and woke up to it playing on The Today Show. My friend told me that after looking through the statistics it had most definitely gotten it's original traffic through reddit.


* Do you get paid to sift through sites or is it an added on job to what you already do?

* Do the hosts understand Reddit?

* Are you an active member or just a lurker?

* Can you get me a job doing this? I know how to spend too much time on Reddit.

* Can you get one of the hosts to wear a reddit alien on the air?

 How long have you been trying to get on? Do you answer the phone with such swag? Are you and Ken Jennings going to get a hot dog sometime? Is Sean Connery an Idol of yours? How excited is your family about this?

Special requests can be granted. I have a pig mask, horse mask and a guitar so use them as you wish. The past three I did were a blast. Thanks guys. 














 (I am posting this earlier today of this third week so you fucksfacers can have some time to get some kick ass shit in. I am just getting home and only 3 in but I am keeping original posts to make it easy. I have a 12 pack and 3 tall boys to go through so its on for the next 5 hours or so.)

 From what I remember I came across this site through liveleak a couple years ago. I was invlolved in the yoursay section and I think someone threw me this way. 









 I love this sub. I am 11 in and still have about two hours to pull this offf if you know what I mean. You want a video of someone saying something to someoen else? You want a video of someone singing your thoughts to someone else? Give it a shot, shit. Okay guyys drunbk now. I cant manage more videos. Next week. :) PS. You fuckers are cool as shit.
Edit:1. Done for tonight. I will be back in the next week. Get your things and stuff ready to say. :) barf.

 Of course this isn't across the board but it seems in English speaking groups and some closely related it is impossible to notice. 




 That was one of my worst fears before hand. I didn't have a drink the first 2 days. Since then over 2 weeks I have tied one on about 5 times. That means about 12-18 beers each night. I still haven't given in which blows my mind. I thought it was impossible. I honestly think I am just finally fucking done with these things. It feels great.

How has it been for you?

 









 Thanks for reading. I know this isn't mind blowing or some great story but I am glad this sub exists so I am able to get it off my chest to some people who it means something to. 
























 side note. What is myspace now? A wall of instructions? 




 The only side effect I have come across so far is being a bit spaced out and super super vivid dreams. No nightmares just super realistic mundane everyday shit with all of the people I know and in all the places I know them. Every night since my first day of being a non-smoker I have smoked in my dreams. Yet, in my dream I knew it was wrong and it was not good. I have woken up each morning thinking I had cheated. 

So far chantix has helped me deal with what I could not. Cravings. Now it's all mental. I have an argument with myself about 20 times daily. It's usually me trying to convince myself to just have one after a trigger. Not happening. I am able to get past that withing 5 minutes. I started carrying around those [plastic floss sticks](http://img.dxcdn.com/productimages/sku_47578_2.jpg). They are a great way to get the oral fixation out of the way and keep my teeth clean.

I have smoked since I was 14. I am just about to turn 35. The past ten years I was up to a 1.5-2.5 a day depending on circumstances. I feels so strong that I am on day 4 and am actually proud of myself for once in many many years. 

Thank you for reading my quick rant. 









 Oh, and no variations on any others.  









 The main thing I am anxious about is what it's like to have that last cigarette on Tuesday night.  










































































 Alfonso on blow is not somebody I would want to run into.

 I even tried taking them with two different cameras. I also tried uploading separate older pics on my laptop and they work but these wont. Anyone else experience this? 


































 Anything goes...except child support and menthol cigarettes.

Creative is always good, but not needed. You got a phone bill or car insurance bill that is behind? Maybe you want to see a concert/show and can't swing it right now (thanks josh) let me know. 

Don't be ashamed to ask for help, okay?

Edit: One electric bill shut off notice and one swedish drinker taken care of. Cheers guys. I love all of you fucking booze faces.

 Yesterday I finally caught a large mouth while out on my kayak. I ran into a guy on his bass boat and we got to talking. I was dragging a worm across the bottom by the weeds and my freaking pole went nuts. 

When I finally got him about 10 feet from my kayak he took my pole about a foot into the water. The guy who is an avid bass fisherman was actually amped/ "Holy shit dude that a biggy"

This fish finally came up and jumped over the tip of my kayak. Coolest looking thing. It was such a rush. 

Sadly I was not able to get a picture and as I was pulling it up next to me it got loose. :( The dude on the boat said it was probably a 6-7 pounder.

I know to most of you this is old news in a bucket but for me it was like christmas morning. 

Anyway I just wanted to tell my tale of it. 




 It's some new show on NBC and I figured you guys would like to know. Now, drink your piss. 




 Anyone down for a quick trip tomorrow at around 6pm at Seldens? 














 I wont mention any bands myself as to not make this a circle jerk of taste in music. Have you ever dealt with this? Do you constantly deal with this?  




 Well, I plugged the sucker in and windows couldn't find the driver. I am using a windows 7 64 bit laptop. So, I went and found the driver(s). The first one installed just fine but the second one (legacy software download) didnt. It said a a time out error. Anyway I go and download audacity because I have fiddled with it over the years and know it is a really stripped down program that some buddies of mine would use when we would write songs. Now I am able to choose the audiobox from the output/speaker menu in Audacity but it is nowhere in the input/mic menu. Does this make any sense to any of you? I am sorry for putting this in the regular askreddit sub but if any of you know a really specific sub for this please let me know and I will move it over there. I am just dying to get some of these songs down on (tape?)

 I will be bringing my kayak and fishing gear for the lake t the campground. Any tips etc? Am I able to get a fishing pass/license for a day or two or do I need to get a full license?  
























 My backyard leads directly into a state forest and there are many stone wall property barriers strewn about.  









 Gear can really ring up after a bit when I'm at the local shop. I love supporting them, but I would love to find a good site that can give me a break here and there. 





























 Does that make sense? I've seen it down before. 




 My girlfriend has seats right behind home plate and I want to see how awesome her seats are. I don't get it with my basic cable package. Any ideas? I am having no luck. I went to the nesn website but I can't figure out if the streaming is actually live or not...or if they will even be showing the game. 
























 I will work out the tangles, okay? 

















































 I just got into it last year and I am looking forward to this season. Anyone out there wanna join me and a buddy tomorrow? It's a long shot but I would love some tips on bait, lures and techniques.  




 I am a recreational kayaker/angler and would love to meet up with some of you for this upcoming season. I created a subreddit @ [r/connecticutkayakers](http://www.reddit.com/r/connecticutkayakers/) for us to plan trips, give location pointers and share pictures/videos. I personally am going to be out for the the next few days after work and this weekend is shaping up to be great. 




 I have been revisiting my youth and honestly it started with listening to the Kids Soundtrack again after almost 20 years. Yes, Dinosaur Junior and KRecords. What else you guys got? 









 I am planning on asking for a raise and would like to be able to use this as some reference. 

















































 Please. 

















































 It's a simple return. Just one w-2 


































 Yah, so? 
























 Yep, spring is ruined.  




 Anyone know what thread it came from? 




 I'll grab some beers and my fishing gear and snag some trout on a big lake. Who's in? 
























 Has anyone heard them yet this year? Was tonight the turning point? I am just waiting for the freaking hornets to start crawling out and messing my entire day up. 



























































 You coming?  





































































 Anyone have any pointers on a cool hotel to stay at and an awesome place to get Thai or Mexican food?

 









 Havent seen him live since 2002. I'm way too excited about this right now.  







































 I'm reaching middle age and I could spend a good day in the shed going through my drill bits, sockets sets and lures. All the while listening to some Supertramp.
Dont get me wrong, I love it.
What else, guys?  














 Anyone else have this issue?

 I use it as a wood working area and the kids store toys/bikes etc. I have see numerous wasps inside but have yet to find a nest. It has a lot of nooks and crannies. There are 2 allergies in the family.  









 I really don't recall him doing anything that would call for this kind of hate. Is it just a build up? 



























































 Have you found anything that has actually worked? Allergy in the household.  
























 ...and it took everything in my soul to not pick up the free lazy boy and Foosball table I saw on the side of the road. 




 Stay strong. 














 They seem to be really cheap on craigslist. Like half of what others are asking for similar trucks. 



















 "at the truck stop we go our separate ways" Journey- Separate Ways 









 Here is the breakdown.

I live in Connecticut so I need 4x4 as I have already had it with my previous jeep grand cherokee and can never go back. Winters get really rough here and my driveway is a pain


It will be my daily driver and my commute is approximately 20-25 miles a day all said and done.


I want to spend no more than $6500

I mainly need it for yard work/dump as my new house has a large yard and no woods in the back. I prefer a long bed as I will be using it for holding my kayak and summer sports gear. 

This will be my first truck. What should I be looking for? Thank you for any response.

 






















































 We made it through to 2 seasons we were able to rent quickly. Where can we watch season 3? Dying for more.  



























































 They aren't frequent at all but they are persistent when they do happen. I am currently sitting in my living room, house to myself for the weekend, 8 beers in and almost just went down to the store to grab a pack. 

I'm not, though. Just typing this out to you guys reminds me of what is wrong with that picture.

sure fucking sneaks up on ya' though, huh? 




 Let's see them.  




 I quit smoking 5 months ago and quit drinking last week. I joined the Y last week as well. I have very high cholesterol. I am 215 and 5'10. My gut is embarrassing large. 

Yesterday though when I was jogging my shins/calves in serious pain. Is this normal? What should I be doing differently? Any suggestions on what to do?
 




 Tonight on SNL boys and girls.  




 as of now i use one of those 5 dollar usb thingys that i plug my s4 usb into but all it does is pretty much drain the battery. verizon wants like 30 bucks. does that sound right? 









 She is rubbing his balls for several minutes.

He asks "you sure love doing that"

She says "I really miss rubbing mine" 






















































 I was living in Seattle and it was around '99. I had entered a contest on Becks website to win a prize package. At the time I was 21 years old, living in a rented room in a band house and barely used the internet. 

A friend of mine bought me tickets to the Beck show at Key Arena as a surprise. It was the Midnite Vultures tour and I freaking knew it was going to be a god damn funky ass shit show. I brought my "demo tape" of  various songs I had created on a shitty four track in my back pocket. I snuck in a joint and had my robot dancing shoes on. 

Ths show, of course kicked ass. The one thing that really stood out was when he did Debra he started it by being lowered down on a king size bed. I thought that shit was the smoothest thing I had ever seen (and still do). At some point I threw my tape up on stage only to see some stage hand kick it back off :(....

Cut to about 3 days after the show I receive a good size package in the mail at work (that was the only address I really trusted at that time) I open it up to find every Beck album released to date...signed by Beck, a t-shirt and a letter that explained what everything was and it said "we hope you enjoyed your VIP experience" 

WTF!!!!

I rev up my bosses beige IBM desktop and sign on to my hotmail (which I never checked...apparently) to find an email congratulating me on winning the prize package. I was to pick up my 2 VIP passes at will call at the same fucking show I went to. 

Yep. That happened. 














 Won't let me interact with it. I press the play button but it just freezes everything and closes baconreader. I even downloaded the vimeo ap but it doesn't even ask if I want to use it when opening a vimeo link. Anyone have this issue?  
























 Any luck with anything? I'm about to [purchase this](http://joby.com/smartphones/griptight-gorillapod-original?utm_source=googleProductSearch utm_medium=CSE utm_campaign=JM3-01WW gclid=CN-o8ZLL_LsCFel9OgodmhkAnA) 



















 Some things you just don't know where to put. 




 I would love for anothber story line to happen with her.  







































 I just watched the dog scene in I Am Legend and I'm sobbing.  












































 I am most likely going to do it in this next year. 




 The axis logos keep turning on and off sporadically and my screens go back to different configs.  






















































 Hard part is; I am chef by trade and around food 8-12 hours a day. 









 Fuck.  














 I want to do live mic stuff. Is this a possibility?  














 I can get a free pizza at a local pizza place but I'm sure there are some other ones.  



















 anyone run into this problem? Also, why in the hell is my wi-fi not in any of my toggle trays? 




 Are you able to use the micro usb for an external mic while using the top headphone jack as a monitor? 












































 I would like to be able to be sure it all shows up the way I would like it to. ;) 









 What do you guys think [of this deal](http://www.musiciansfriend.com/pro-audio/cad-pro-7-drum-microphone-kit-7-piece?source=3WWRWXGP gclid=CPfCk8r_07oCFQpnOgoddFcAyQ kwid=productads-plaid%5e57299776267-sku%5e270749000000000@ADL4MF-adType%5ePLA-device%5ec-adid%5e30424599627)? 




 I have never had a credit card, mortgage or car payment. Hell, I use a pay as you go phone. I am 35. I believe In had a department store card about 15 years ago with a 200 dollar limit and I can't even remember if I paid it off or not. 




 +100 ,!!! 




 I am always really curious of the state or town these pictures are coming from. Love this sub. Stay cool, y'all. 


































 I can also add 100 dollars of my own money as well.

I want to be able to record my vocals and some live guitar/bass/drums.

what say you

:) 









 Saturday while I was on the highway all of a sudden my truck slipped out of gear revving the hell out of my engine. Now, It wont work in D or R. 1st and second still work manually. They kind of go into D and R and feels like it starts to go but not really. It moves a tiny bit.
I went and pulled the codes

P0735

P1270

B1600

P0171

None of this looks good.
In have had a strange electrical issue for a while. Says door is ajar when its not, engine light go on and off, blinker is sparatic and makes a gritty noise half the time. After all this went down now the blinker works absolutely perfect while it hasn't since I've owned it.
Anyone advice on where I should start besides of course bringing it the shop. Im going crazy not knowing and nobody is around until tomorrow. 





























 I played every day for about 2 years while I was living out in Seattle. I sure miss it. Thought I would check on here to see if anyone was near me to play sometime...and where? 














 If so, how was the experience? 

4 year degree, trade school or whatever. 

Any financial aid? 

Any tips?

Reason being I am tired of what I've been doing all along. I never went to school and there is no future (that I want) financially in what I currently do.

 




 Along the lines of the ones we did in high school but maybe something that takes into account what we have already done so far.
 





























 I'm talking about a 3 bedroom house with full attic and a shed that i just need to rig for year round heat. 

i now only really have late nights etc for the recording. 
























 I'll leave mine in the comments.  





























 Specifically 11/26/78 




 Why don't I see usernames on posts when they are links?  



















 Check out the entrance to America's favorite past time. ;)  




 These guys give out an outrageous amount of fries when you order them.  

Next and last clue at 1130 




 **SUPER DUPER SECRET SCAVENGER HUNT THING**

It's the city where [these guys formed](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe4EK4HSPkI)

Next clue will be coming around 11 am, ensuring anyone who wants or has the time to get in on it...can. 

 



















 Just shoot us mods a message or make it known in this thread. 

This year me and my SO both have parents in the midst of serious health issues whom both reside in separate states far too many miles apart.  Meaning I will be doing a much smaller dinner at home.

Location is Deep River

 









 I can't. What's up with that?  




 Last week redditgifts sent us mods a message informing us that a user would be posting clues to the secret box in this subreddit, and to keep it a secret. 

It somehow ended up in /r/hartford. Nothing against /r/hartford (they are a fine upstanding subreddit) but they have about 8,000 less subscribers. 

To ensure that the rest of connecticut gets to partake in this I am doing my own. 

**THE SUPER DUPER SECRET SCAVENGER HUNT THING**

To keep it relevant and not lose steam I am having it this Sunday (11/23). Be sure to keep your eyes peeled to /r/connecticut Sunday at around 8AM for the riddles/clues/etc.

The first clue will point towards the general area of the state and the next clue will be given after there is ample time for anyone from any corner of the state to make it to that area...ensuring everyone can get in on it.

I promise the box won't suck. 























































































































 Even on the cleanest of settings I'm getting a nasty fuzz . 




 Almost so much that I don't even read them. It's just become a free ad space for them to promote whatever they are releasing. 

In New York releasing a movie/book? Stop by and see Victoria.  














 I will be using an acoustic guitar, electric bass, electric guitar, drum set and a midi keyboard. I will only be recording solo. I already have

1. Garageband
2. Magellan
3. DM1
4. Funkbox
5. MusicStudio 2
6. Loopy HD

What I am wondering is what should I get for an audio interface and vocal/acoustic guitar mic? Thinking of getting a mixer for the acoustic drum recording. (want to make sure what I get is compatible)

I am going to use my bestbuy credit card to get the interface and mic. 

Whats my best bet guys/gals?

Thank you. :) 




 Anybody found a really good realistic sounding drum app? 



















 Been hearing how horrible this is going to be in the winter. It's 4x4 but that's only good for certain elements. 

What is your experience/tips/tricks?

My only other 4x4 experience was with a 97 jeep grand Cherokee Laredo. Otherwise I have owned front wheel drive sedans. 




 It's from their song Sweet Home Alabama.  





























 I'm noticing how many people coming into this cancer wing just reek of cigarettes. So many sick looking people. Fuck cigarettes. 

Obviously not every person who has cancer is because of smoking or vice versa. It's just what is in my face right now.  














 Whenever I click a vimeo link it just goes black or kind of freezes.  






















































 I got free tickets for it. What should I expect? Anyone? 



















 fuck, though. I need my garageband open to record some bad ass shit that wont go anywhere.

not kiding. 





























 Need to catch up a bit 







































 Thats right. Give me a tag line and a name. Like this.

1. Crazy shit

2. CriT 




 The Fuck. Is Wrong With U! 









 Sitting here in my shed/workshop with a few drinks and a joint. Man, this album is fucking top notch. Been years since I gave it a good spin. It was that time when I could hear Beck starting to get serious with his songwriting, if you  know what I mean.  





































































 Anyone know what I mean? 


































 What do I need to make this work? I also have I an maudio fast track.

Thank  you much in advance. :) 




 What do I need to do to make this work? I've also got an m-audio fast track interface.

Thank you in advance :) 




 I use and love baconreader for my phone (galaxy s4.) I can't for the life of me figure out how to view my own profile in the iPad version. 



















 Been using Microsoft and Android my entire life (I'm 35).
I bought it manly for the use of and easy access to GarageBand. Android doesn't have anything close for me. 

I'm new here guys. What do I need to know?


So far the main thing I have an issue with is the keyboard. I'm very used to swift key on my galaxy s4. Gotta say this thing has a very high quality feel.

 I have been having smoking dreams in the past week or so. One so vivid that I recall telling people in my dream that I just gave up 11 months. I recall saying it was gross and not finishing it. I didn't even finish it in my dream. 

I am on the wagon so I think that's why my dreams have been so much more vivid. 

You guys get these dreams even almost a year into no cigarettes? 


































 I could clean up a 7 computer pretty well. What should I look out to get rid of on this one? 














 Dude probably looks pissed off while eating lobster as he gets a blow job.  



















 Plan on getting a tablet for just this. Also a mic that works well with this? 

Edit: **MULTITRACKING** 
























 I just had a nightmare last night (not something I normally have) that I watched a friend from high school get mauled by a grizzly.


I haven't seen this kid in 20 years. I've never seen a bear in real life. 

In the dream I was hanging out with a bunch of friends from high school (in high school times) and there happened to be a bunch of bears around. We all notice one that snuck up on us. I bolted for the car and got in along with a few of my other friends. My other friend, Dan didn't make it and I watched him get torn apart by this bear right up against the car.


I woke up as the bear had begun prying/tearing the door apart next to me. 




 So discouraging. I need to massage the hell out of my calves and up my legs to my butt. My stamina is fine. I was barely winded.

 Lets hear them. :) 





























 With all of the advances we have had over the years with computers why are we still using the ump behind the plate? 



















 [Here are my stats](http://www.rundouble.com/user/fb:604245161/E4jLy5cB)

W2D1 was very rewarding and fairly easy. Today was a beast. I may be getting shin splints, I'm not sure. The pain was almost unbearable. Also, all of the other days I felt really good and after each workout and even sometimes got that extra burst of energy. Today afterwards I really hurt, felt exhausted and almost sick to my stomach. What am I doing wrong? I stretch before each workout. Maybe not enough? 





























 I have for many years claimed he is my favorite musician/songwriter. I was introduced to him through a friend who got some shit from some skater magazine back in early high school. That is where it began. 

Long story short...it stuck.

This last show in Providence was the first time I saw him perform in over 10 years. Life just happens. We miss simple things. This performance reminded me to never let them slip by. I don't mean just Beck but any band/musician you are into. Just make it fucking happen. 

I had such a blast, enjoyed every minute of the show and just became  even more of a fan of his catalogue. 

Side note. I became a musician because of Beck and now that i have settled down and have some stability in my ,life I am slowly gathering equipment again to produce.  



















 Scanning this sub and I'm noticing a lot of complaints.  









 I just barely made it but I did.  




 Lets meet up for a drink before or after and do a cheesy /r/beck pic for the sub. Why not, right? 









 We will be in town for a concert tomorrow night and have a hotel in the city. We want to spend the day at the beach and maybe even sunday late morning as well. I want to know from the locals which is the best for travel between the hotel and the beach. We arent coming from far (next state over) but thought I would ask you guys for the best advice. Thank you much. :) 





























 I'm amazed at the shit that gets to the top in this sub.  




 Probably should have been sent to Flint.  




 Not Flint, Michigan?  




 There was am awesome one last year at two roads. I couldn't make it but everyone seemed to have a great time via the pics etc.  




 Please show me where Obama is attempting to take away the right for someone to pray. 

Edit: can anyone?  




 My primary said that she was prepared to do a prostate exam but since we had scheduled a visit with a gastroenterologist we could just wait. I'm a dude so yah, I decided to wait. Not sure why I would feel more comfortable with a guy sticking shit up my ass but...i am.  




 Nanananananamananana I can't hear you nananananana 




 Sometimes she goes sometimes she doesn't  









 And still with a huge grin .  




 Stay out of the fucking left lane!

 At the vfw the old guy who they all made tell the story.  




 Same here. Still have them somewhere. 




 the music has been impeccable this last half of the season. 




 oooh like an extra 10 minutes  




 No, it's Mothers Day.

 kept expecting him to wake up from that attack scene. 




 but she didnt know until this episode. 




 Twisted.  




 How so?  




 Lets get back on topic of Rampart, people. 




 I started a sub years ago that never got any traction but i sure wish it would.

 Wild Hogs discussion thread. Never Forget!

 Let's all just hug it out.  




 ahhh the no shoes policies. Feels like it's been forever. 




 Funny, I'm watching Bucket List right now. Hopefully blowing some lines is on that list.  




 i, i still dont get it.  




 auto-correct is hilarious. 














 Swallows do that here where I live on a small island along the mouth of the ct river in Old Lyme, Connecticut. Really fascinating to watch.  




 lol 




 there is a gif of that actually. thought this was going to be that one but... 




 i had 33 




 Cops know about it. A bus driver filmed the altercation. I'm in the other side if the country. It's a friend of mine in Eugene. Just wondering by chance if anyone knows the guy and knows the whereabouts of the dog. Shot in the dark.  




 How do toy know it was reported?  




 "what's this thing around me neck?"  




 You think that's strictly a teenager thing? That's cute. 




 Came here for this. Not let down.  




 anyone? 









 thats quite a "in the closet" song, eh? 




 Phenomenal [album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp5_Ul-qG0w list=PLFEDE25F4A684239E) 




 booya. that shit was my jam. 




 what, no link? 




 I've got a grill full of cheeseburgers, flap steaks, and shrimp in my back yard right now. Care to join? 




 Once again, thank you. 

This isn't an event actually but kayaking season is well underway. Heading out now in old Lyme. I'd like to have a semi regular /r/connecticut  kayak gathering this summer. Get at me anyone.  




 "Thank god they know the lyrics, since I forgot them" 




 How's it hanging man?  




 I'm so afraid of this. I'm an only child raised by my single mom. She has had two heart surgeries and is now battling cancer, going through chemo. This is so very tough. I'm very sorry for what you have gone through.  




 like Polar Vortex

next up

Sun Tornado 




 luckily (knock on wood) I have never had allergies in my 36 years. 

sorry, everyone who has allergies. 




 I want to joke along but I just can't.  




 subtle? I don't think you know what that word means. 




 depending on who you are I suppose and where you live etc...

it's not black and white per say.  




 you do see what is upvoted and what is downvoted, right? 




 Yep. Seattle had some amazing places. Would spend every day in those shops. 




 Oh fuck is that like another play on Christianity? Like, wedding alter bridge?  














 She's a certified dietician?  




 sounds like an average Tuesday night. 




 right? I listen to it every few years or so on repeat for like a half an hour. The fuckin jam. 




 David Forgets was fucking hilarious. 




 who says? 




 except maybe someone eating your cupcakes? 




 yah, why don't people understand this is what boggles my mind.  




 meat sauce lasagne though, right? 
























 Did a sunset paddle last night on the lake I just moved to. Loving being able to just drag my kayak out and go. 









 The battery is bulging. Lasts 1/2 a day. Fairly heavy user. Can anyone give me the best amazon link for what I'm looking for? 


































 I've been looking online and can't seem to find anything that has convinced or otherwise. It's a scary time and while this doesn't seem like it would do any harm is it's still weirding me out. 









 I got into them really early when they were just starting to hit the scene. Loved everything and then responsibility and my 30's hit and  for some reason keeping up on albums etc went by the wayside.

I spent a good 5-6 years just throwing on the old stuff I knew or just talk radio when it came to silence.

Listening to El Pintor for my first time all the way through. (I know, i'm late) but damn its almost a better feel knowing its a trio. That video for Everything is Wrong. Holy shit is that not the coolest video. 10/10 on that video.
 





























 Not sure if it matters but I'm in the USA and they are in England. Maybe there is some weird thing that gets in the way. 




 Does this sound interesting? I can cover bass and guitar and any keys. My drums are in storage at the moment and I don't currently own a good mic. 

Lets do this! 




 Any ideas?

 It's like /r/fishing just blowing up.  



















 there's got to be something but I'm not catching it. You? 









 It's strange it happened this way. Of course Sea Change has a lot more "break up" themes but Morning Phase has the same damn feel and all I can do is pump my body full of vodka and soda...and fucking wish I had valium.

Wave might be one of my favorite tracks by him of all time. 

I'm 36, have been into all of his stuff from when I was a kid in the early 90's but this album is the god damn fucking bees fucking knees.  














 No complaints just curious.

Dude is awesome. Anyone follow anything he did the past couple decades? He was in a band called 764-Hero for a time in Seattle. His bass style is awesome.  




 http://i.imgur.com/rt4Mqz7.jpg 














 Case in point. Let's take this [Savoir Adore song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4ryqWze6U t=33)

and then this [Taylor Swift song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CmadmM5cOk t=17)

Also, as soon as I noticed this I sent a tweet to Savoir Adore and they replied that funny as I wasn't the first one to mention it. 

Fuck, both songs kick fucking ass in my book. 




 Looking to get a few people together.  














 Anyone else live in Seattle for their run?

I did, it was grand. 

[posting my favorite song by them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc0clTOXlBM)

fans of quality shit get at me if you live in Connecticut. Lets make it.  









 *sweeeet* 




 Anyone dealt with this? As always trying to contact them is hilarious. waiting back from an email...

 I plug it in but nothing pops up. Am I doing something wrong?  




 I actually had a front page post of [something related](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qaew2/i_am_a_chef_by_tradetell_me_what_is_in_your/) a couple years ago.

I'm at work with a full kitchen and ready to record. Have at it.

**EDIT** Just getting to edit the first one and going up in a minute. cheers.

**EDIT 2** This is all going to happen but it will take time. Spring project check back.  









 I introduced it to my girlfriend last month and of course she fell in love so we got in a couple episodes a night and then a good 5 or 6 on Sundays. 

Heres the thing...we decided to split up in about the 4th season so we watched one of if not the most deep, relationship heavy shows of all time...while breaking up. We have been together for 6 years. It is fairly amicable but very tough, of course. 

We live together and I am going to be the the one moving out. She has kids (from a previous marriage) which I have grown to love and consider family. This is all very difficult but a new beginning. 

The last 4 episodes starting with Nates death was just a bawling fest but the finale, which I knew was going to be one of if not the most amazing finales was going to crush us. 

Well, it did. We spent the hour or so after the ending just sobbing...talking...apologizing for everything. We are still splitting up but it was very therapeutic to have this all coincide. 

Thank you for reading.

 I do. 15 gigs left. Whats the deal you think? 


































 It's an 03 ranger. They have a lift and full shop... but is there anything I can do to "prep" before I head down there? 


































 Have you ever come across something after they have passed away as well?

EDIT: To clarify. Some alcoholics instead of flaunting it or not give a shit will attempt to hide it. That's what this post is all about. 


































 I live in Connecticut directly across from you and I thought it would be fun sometime to try and get a picture of something silly like a roman candle or something. 

I see your lights often when it's clear. 
























 I've got an 03 Ford Ranger which has been diagnosed by two shops as needing a new transmission. It's drives but I have no reverse or O/D. It shifts into reverse and when I press on the gas it budget a bit. What I am currently doing is turning off the O/D switch on the column and manually shifting 1st into second and then second into D which it then in turn shifts itself from 3rd to 4th. 

A friend of mine has an 02 Explorer which has a blown engine but a working transmission. Both of these vehicles are 4.0 4X4 and Automatic. I'm wondering if I could switch it out? The VIN#'s for both are:

Ranger 1FTZR45E63TA39056

Explorer 1FMDU73K52ZC97255

Also, if not is there any way I could buy one online on the cheap and do it myself (I'm fairly handy). I've got a general knowledge of how these work and a 250 piece craftsman socket set but would rather pay someone if it's impossible for me to do this on my own. 

 














 Keeping mine in comments. 














 Of course something so simple is eluding me.  




 Looking for a mechanic to do some work on the side or anyone who is comfortable doing a tranny switch. I have the vin numbers for both vehicles to make sure they are compatible. 02 ford explorer to a 03 ford ranger. Both automatic both 4.0. both v6. Located in Deep River.  




 Let's hear it.  


































 Why am I having such a terrible time figuring this out? 














 In the late 90's I owned a [Boss BR-8](http://www.bossus.com/gear/productdetails.php?ProductId=437) and I recently came upon a dozen or so of my zip discs.

I have an [iomega zip 100](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Iomega-Zip-100-Drive-USB-100MB-pc-mac-compatible-usb-powered-nice-/201267810149) which is allowing me to download the files. They are in vs3 and vr8 formats. 

Does anyone know where to go from here? Has anyone had any luck? In a perfect world I would love it if there was a Boss app that would just accept these files and let me connect it via fire cable on my ipad.

Yah, right.

I own a windows 7 laptop and an ipad 4gen.

Any ideas?

Thanks for reading. 
























 Sure hoping so.  



















 I think they held on to some big guns in the writing department for this series finale via 4 episodes. There was a time where I was falling "out of love" with the show but these past 2 episodes have really brought me back and now I'm super sad its really going to end.

 I am preparing myself by starting to watch Six Feet Under all the way through (again)
