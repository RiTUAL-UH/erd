I've been enjoying r/aviation for a while now, and often see fantastic pictures taken from airplane windows.

Then, I thought, what a good idea for a subreddit. I was surprised I couldn't find one, so took a chance and started my first sub. If you also like pictures taken from airplanes, please promote, subscribe and contribute! Thanks. [r/picturesfromplanes](http://www.reddit.com/r/PicturesFromPlanes/).

PS - I hope this isn't considered SPAM.
**TL/DR: PicturesFromPlanes, new sub.**

 I was just curious as to how (and if) they go about salvaging equipment from a crash like Flight 214. Is there a company that specializes in doing that? Is everything just written off? Any information would be appreciated. 










































































































































































































































 I kind of wish I'd become a pilot... 



















 Seems to me most folks here aren't down with writing 750 characters or more. 




 I mean, besides to obvious, swimming pools and such. 




























































































































 I was thinking about guitarists. Take two people at the same age, teach them guitar the same way, have them practice the same amount, etc. One person is invariably going to excel over the other. The same thing applies with other things, like sports, games, etc. Why? 














 Wow. Close call for me. 2007 Mini idling rough, slight clacking sound. Checked oil, thought there was plenty. Nope. Turns out it was down to ONE quart. Gasp. No harm done, but I will be checking properly every few weeks from now on... 











































































































































 Even if you aren't currently on death row, you can still answer. I would have fried clams, flank steak, garlic mashed potatoes and a double IPA to wash it down

 I think it would be fun to be a golf ball, because you'd fly high and fast through the air. 
























 And get offa' my lawn while you're at it! 































































































































































































































































































































 Getting Chinese food, want something new... 





























 It's raining. Again. 










































































 Just throwing this out there for discussion. I noticed Sunday when Bell was near the sideline on a few runs, he stepped out like Franco used to, rather than smashing into the defensive man, like Bettis loved to do. I am conflicted, because I loved the way Bettis would punish people, but I also want Bell healthy for a loooong time. Thoughts? 


















































































































 Me - I don't know my blood type. Or CPR. Seems those are good things to know.
