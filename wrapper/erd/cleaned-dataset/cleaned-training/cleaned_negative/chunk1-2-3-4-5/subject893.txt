 For instance if you live in a blue state would it even matter if you voted Republican?  





























 And if you could specify what political party you align with that'd be great. 



















 AR style rifles or "assault weapons" as they are commonly referred to are the main target of gun control. IMO this is the direct result of sensationalism on behalf of the media. I believe that anyone who thinks that AR style rifles are any worse than any other gun is uneducated on the matter and should have no say. I believe that anyone who uses an AR style rifle as an example of why we need gun control is either A) a politician using fear mongering tactics to further their cause, or B) a voter who is uneducated on the matter and should not have a say. I believe so because AR (Armalite NOT assault rifle) style rifles function exactly the same as any other semi automatic rifle. The difference is that AR style rifles have creature comforts that make them easier to carry around and use for long periods of time (like when you're hunting). CMV.

 Edit: shit this blew up. Also, TIL Redditors complain about things they can easily avoid. 

Edit 2: the amount of you that want condoms banned concerns me.

Edit 3: TIL Redditors hate toilet paper.

Edit 4: TIL Many redditors don't know the definition of the word "product"


Edit 5: OK, based on my inbox it seems like most people have decided on cigarettes, crocs, dildos, cell phones (I'm going to interpret that as smartphones), axe, and toilet paper.

Edit 6: Add soda (particularly coke), alcohol, and social networks to the list

 For the past few months I've had this thought/worry in my head. I know it's not true but I can't get it out of my head. It's this strange thing that I don't want in my head. If it were true then I would be shunned by society and I could be sent to prison. Again, I know it's not true but I still can't get it out of my head. 



Recently (past week) I haven't been able to stop thinking about it whereas I can usually push it to the back of my mind. It has caused me to become very depressed and stressed out. The thought that it could be true just pushes me over the edge. I don't know what to do. My research tells me that depression and anxiety can cause strange thoughts. If meds can get this thought out of my head and keep it from controlling my life then I want them. 














 I've ordered [this](http://www.cigarsinternational.com/samplers/58017/ci-taster-pack-mild-medium/#p-27068) yesterday.

I think I'm going to order [this](http://www.famous-smoke.com/montecristo+premium+cigar+assortment+4+pack+cigars/item+37285) if I end up enjoying cigars.

I'm pretty excited though and I really want to try one today. unfortunately we don't have any "real" smoke shops in my town. We pretty much have a few head shops disguised as smoke shops. Should I just wait or is there something I can pick up at a gas station that's worth trying? 




 **My 5 Questions:**

1. Did you feel in danger at any time?

5. Was it fun?

 Keep in mind that I'm not afraid to get dirty. I'm willing to work construction, garbage, etc. Basically I don't have a problem working a blue collar job if it means I can make some cash. 









 I was out of control. I had a two large big mac combo a day problem. One day as I was driving away from the drive thru with my first big mac of the day I started regretting my choices. I looked down at it and tossed it out the window right then and there, and I haven't touched a big mac since.

 Hey! So a few of my friends and I discovered an abandoned logging road awhile back. We drove pretty far down it until it became impassible via car. We scouted it on Google maps and it turns out it branches into a system of out of use logging roads, some of which lead to a coastal town that we all like visiting. Using Google's routing tool we discovered the whole trip would take ~8 hours on quads. But that figure could be off. We plan in borrowing a few ATV's, I believe the guy said they were 400cc Yamaha Utility quads.



What we plan on bringing:


Each Quad and rider will have:

*2 gallons of spare gas

*sleeping bag

*Camel Bak and spare water

*Hatchet+manual chainsaw

*Emergency water purification tablets and MREs

*Toilet paper

*Eating utensils

*Lighter

*clothes

*flair gun

*walkie talkie




Split between the three quads:

*tent

*gas powered chainsaw

*fire starters

*cooking stuff

*repair tools





Now I'm debating whether or not we need a collapsing toilet seat. We'll be about 20 miles from a major highway most of the time, but there will be logging camps nearby most of the time. Can you think of anything else we'll need. I think we might be able to do the trip in one day but I'm preparing as if we'll come across obstacles or won't be able to ride as fast as google suggests we can. It also depends on if there's anything we'll want to explore.  









 Edit: just realized that I fucked up the title 



















 There's obviously still a demand because people are buying foreign cars with M/T's. 




 Seeing as I won't be able to visit NYC until spring break at the earliest I'd like to know a bit more about the surrounding areas and whatnot.  





























 I think it may have been a reply to a Q on AskReddit. I also think it may have hit the front page. He later edited in a drawingof it that he made when he was a kid. I'm pretty sure he was located in Colorado at the time and his story was confirmed by another Redditor who saw the same thing and also lived in Colorado.  









 **My 5 Questions:**

1. Were you in the city or at the base when the battle happened?

2. Did any of you expect to see combat during that deployment? 

3. IMO One of the, for lack of a better word, funniest scenes in the movie was when the Delta operator went on his "safari" and got dinner. Did that kind of thing actually happen? 

4. What did you do after being discharged? 

5. If you could go back in time knowing what you know now, would you still join up?

Somebody could ask around in /r/military. 




 John Marston has a special ability called "Dead Eye". It allows him to seemingly slow time while still retaining normal mobility, target enemies, and increase general combat effectiveness. 


In GTA V each character has their own special ability.


Franklin can slow time while driving.


Trevor takes less damage while dealing more.


Michael can slow time while shooting.


All three are watered down variants of "Deadeye". But wait! The plot thickens! In RDR John Marston has three conflicting personalities. He is a family man that just wants to get back to his family. He wants to better his lifestyle at all costs. He is a rough around the edges cowboy. 


Franklin has inherited the dreamer personality. All he wants is to get out of the ghetto.


Michael represents the family man. His end game is to be closer to his family.


Trevor represents the rough around the edges cowboy. Sure, he's insane, but he also has a caring personality. 




 Seriously, I got a medium Pepsi from Arby's today and it was like a big gulp from 10 years ago. 




 Seriously. Especially in the college hill/friendly area the retaining walls turn so many intersections into dangerous, blind, corners. Anybody know how to get the ball rolling on a fix for this? In the meantime I might put up some of those domed security mirrors.

 Basically my choice at this point comes down to ROTC. How can I tell the quality of a program? 




 As a prospective cadet I'd like to know a few things. 


What is the PT schedule?  Sorry if this is obvious, but I couldn't find it kn the website. 



Does being a cadet prevent you from having a good time and partying?



Is the teacher/CO strict in comparison to other ROTC programs?  









 I'm looking for a solid college commuter. I've got a car, so it won't be my only mode of transportation. My commute is 4 miles in 25-30 mph residential neighborhoods, and 6 miles on a 45 mph freeway.





Here's what I'm looking at: the Ninja 300 (abs?), the Suzuki Boulevard S40, and the CBR250R, but I just read that they are coming out with a CBR300R, so I might wait for that. I'm also thinking about getting a used H-D Iron 883 sportster. Other suggestions are welcome. My budget is ~5500, although ideally I'm buying a nice used bike in the 3500-4500 range.

 We know from some nifty detective work by users on this subreddit that Brian will return. The question is, how? Stewie has destroyed his time travel tech and has no way to build a new time machine. However, we also know from S4E30 that they have time travel tech in the future, and that future stewie (stu) is in possession of this technology.



My theory is that the Griffin's will make a time capsule for their future selves. Stewie will leave a letter for Stu in the time capsule begging him to come back to the present and help save Brian. We will then have an episode from Stu's perspective as he reads the letter and travels back in time to save Brian. 




 A month or two ago I changed my Microsoft account email because I had lost access to the old email. Since then every time I log onto xbox.com it tells me something has gone wrong, and every time I try to go to the billing information part of my xbox I get an error code (I'll check to see what it is later) and then I can't change anything. Any idea what's wrong? I want to download some DLC's, but I can't until I add a credit card. 




 I know you guys are not lawyers but I thought I'd ask.



It seems like online bitcoin gambling is legal, or at least a grey area. Would the same apply to brick   mortar bitcoin gambling? Say you had a system where they sent you a bitcoin payment, and you then gave them an equivalent amount of chips. When it comes time to cash out, you send them a digital bitcoin payment. Since bitcoin is not considered legal tender (yet), would this get around gambling laws? It seems like it would because there is no exchange of cash between parties



Edit: US gambling laws.

 I occasionally attend confession. Not to right myself with a God, but to have a way to get stuff I feel guilty about off my chest. Many would say that by attending confession and reading the Bible I am a Catholic.  Basically where do we draw the line between subscribing to a religion and agnostics, and then agnostics and athiests? Can an athiest believe in any form of higher power (luck, superstition, etc) or would that make them an agnostic? 









 In the coming months should it still be treated as an investment or is it becoming a true currency? The reason I ask is because I was introduced to bitcoins when the silk road bust happened, and it has become a very intriguing investment option to me. 




 And do you believe that that's a good or bad thing?

 Hey all. I have been looking at spec miatas on racing junk and I've found one I like, but I have a few questions. I presume, but I'd like confirmation,  that buying a ready to race spec miata with high miles and putting another motor in is cheaper than making a lower mile miata race ready, correct? I'm pretty heavy, 240 lbs, can I make weight in a 1.6 or should I try to find a 1.8?



Finally,  and this has nothing to do with those questions. Why are SM's with wins more expensive?  In a driver dependent format like SM the car's pedigree doesn't seem like it would matter. 




 I'm probably not using the correct term to describe them, but I have examples.

--

On an ask reddit thread a few days ago there was a guy who mentioned he's part of a growing group that has decided not to identify as any race. Regardless of their birth race they have decided to mark, or write in, "other" as their race on forms.

--

There was a guy on reddit a few days ago asking how to tell his girlfriend that he wouldn't be getting her an engagement ring because it's an outdated practice.

--

Theres also the people who have decided to give everything a PC name. For example instead of referring to a male as just a man they feel the need to call them a cisgendered man.

--

Finally there was the guy who decided Sir and Mam aren't PC enough and is trying to create a gender neutral version.

Now I get these are of varying levels of extremity but I'd like your opinion on these types of people. 




 It doesn't seem like a religious thing and there is no proof that fapping in moderation is harmful.  I don't get it.

 I made an Italian friend over the summer. He was by no means a smoker, but he would always have a cigarette in hand at parties. After I asked him about It he explained that in Europe, especially Italy   France,  smoking is much more accepted, and that many people there are social smokers. Why is it that in the US we have the mentality that you can either kill youself as a heavy smoker or you don't smoke at all, whereas occasional smoking is commonplace in Europe? 




 So I woke up a few days ago and my left foot hurt. The pain feels like soreness. It's now a few days later and my foot hurts when I walk. The pain is coming from the top of the foot a little ways behind the big toe. Any ideas as to what is going on? I'm 18, male, overweight but not to the point that I can't play football with my friends, not currently on any medication. 




 My dream for college has always been to attend a high caliber school, and (don't hate) join a fraternity. Due to certain circumstances I can't get into the types of schools I wan't to go to as a freshman. Is it possible to transfer into a school like USC after your freshman year? I can't do it after my sophomore year because I won't be able to join a frat.

 I'm looking to buy my first Evo!!!!!!!!!!! The guy wants 18k for it. I know I should be wary of mods, which this has, and it also has a new transfer case which makes me think it had the whine of death at some point. I'm not sure if that leaves lasting damage.

So I'm looking at an Evo viii/ix or a WRX right now. But I'm looking for alternatives because those are pushing it in terms of insurance ccosts. Any ideas? Must be fast, built post 2000, able to handle snow, and less than 14k. Manual transmission is a plus. It doesn't need to be a four door but I do need to be able to squeeze four people in. Also why do Evo IX's still cost 20k+

 I'm in the market for an '08+ WRX. I know I should look for salvage titles, and I assume if it has mods I should checkout the tranny, but what else? Is their a difference in performance between the hatch and the sedan? Finally will they be much cheaper when '14 rolls around? Because I'd love to get an STI, but I can't afford one at the moment.

 I'm an American and I'm planning on visiting Ireland soon. What should I do? What shouldn't I do? For instance my ancestors were Irish. Do Irish people get annoyed when we talk about that? Is there pub etiquette that we may not know about? etc. 




 Like what genre? 




 Mine are:

Hero of war - Rise Against

Where were you (when the world stopped turning) - Alan Jackson

Otherside - Macklemore (I'm not sure if this song is actually that sad. It might be because I was in a bad place because a close family member relapsed when I first heard it, and I associate it with that.)

There are a couple more I just can't think of them now. Will edit if I do. 




 Are you trying to maximize the human experience? Do you use them to study? Just curious. 




 A little background, I'm a senior in high school searching for work/paid internships over the summer. My high school diploma is coming with something that basically says I specialized in business   marketing while I was there. I'm not sure if other states do this, but here in Oregon it's called Career Aligned Mastery (CAM). For privacy reasons I will not put my resume up, but I have some questions.

Is it appropriate to list my tutor as a reference? If I'm applying for a summer job online can I say that I have a high school diploma? I have not graduated yet, but I will by the time I've started working there. Finally, do I mention the CAM or will they not care? 




 Context: you can get as much as you want, whenever you want, totally for free. BUT the drug has not been studied, so there is no way of knowing if it will screw you up in the long run. 

NZT-48 is the pill from the movie Limitless.

My answer: Yes I would. A drug that unlocks every scrap of information you have ever heard or seen in your life while simultaneously giving you limitless motivation is too good to pass up. 




 Did you notice any changes to your senses or your physical abilities? Do you have any stories that you feel like sharing? 




 It'll be primarily on flat, paved, bike paths. I'm looking at the mercier kilo TT and the Fuji track classic right now. I'd like to get a single speed for ease of use, but I'd consider geared bicycles. Fixies without a flip flop hub are out of the question. On both those bikes I would replace the handlebars, and put a second rear brake lever on the drop bar. Any other suggestions? My budget is $650. 




 Hey all! In preparation for college next year I've decided to start trying to live on less than $50.00 per week including food, transportation, and entertainment. Today I decided to spend a bit extra on lunch because I've started riding my bike instead of driving. The review will be broken into two parts: The angry whopper, and BK's new satisfries.

Angry Whopper: Initially I was going to get chicken strips, but when I saw the pic of the angry whopper I had to try it. It's your standard sized whopper with pepperjack, bacon, jalapenoes, and a spicy sauce. The picture made it seem like they would put french fries on the burger for you, however mine did not. I sat down in the BK and opened the box. The burger looked similar to the picture. It is pretty messy. It wasn't too spicy it just had enough kick to the point that you could feel it. all in all 7/10 (on the fast food scale).

Satisfries: (medium size) These were the reason I went to BK. I had been wanting to try them. They are crinkle cut, and healthier than the classic BK french fries. I didn't get ketchup so I just a them plain which was fine because they are decently salty. They're not crispy at all. I would compare them in terms of size and texture to steak fries. Despite the mixed reviews I enjoyed them. They have more of the soft potato filler stuff in them than your stereotypical fast food french fry. They tasted like the fries at 5 guys except less greasy. 8/10 just don't expect them to taste like BK's classic fries. 







































 I watched the first episode of the season and the second made no sense. So I looked at the order of episodes on the wiki and it's completely different from Netflix. 

Edit: I'm also down a few drinks so sorry for the grammar.  









 I really want an open air truck but the broncos are too expensive, the wranglers are too common, and there aren't any clean scouts around these parts. Is there any other type of open truck?  









 What did he do to you? I know that he spreads the party school rep, but that doesn't really seem like enough for most people I've talked to to dislike him.  














 The weight room in my high school has an assisted pull up machine. I have never seen one of those before in my life. Have I just not been looking hard enough or is it a rarity?  














 So yesterday I was weightlifting and one of the guys I was lifting with wanted me to do deadlifts. The form he showed me felt off but I went with it, legs straight and at shoulder width back bent when picking up the weight. After a few reps I felt a twinge on the lower right side of my back, initially I didn't realize what it was because it wasn't excessively painful, but I soon stopped when I realized ehat was happening. Since then I've had sort of a dull soreness in that lower right area of my back. I can't really feel it when I'm standing or lying flat on my back. Yesterday it seemed to go away when I was taking a hot shower. I really don't want to deal with a doctor but I also really don't want to screw up my back permanently. I know for certain that I won't use anymore free weights or do back exercises until I've researched proper form.

**tl;dr** Was deadlifting with straight legs and bent back yesterday and felt slight twinge. Today I have a sort of dull pain on the right side of my lower back that goes away when standing or lying flat. What do I do?

**edit**

I did a sort of stretching exercise and if I lift my knee so thet it's at a 90 degree angle while my body is turned to the right of my waist then when I put it down I feel a popping in my back.  









 My only riding experience is the MSF course. I was just offered a great deal on an FZ6 but I'm worried that it might be too much bike. I am a big guy, ~260 lbs so I have been looking for something bigger than a 250. My other options are an SV650 naked, and a ninja 500. I know the SV650 is tame for a 650 so I'm not as worried about grabbing too much throttle and launching myself to my death. 









 I really want to watch Common Law which aired for one season during the summer of 2012. It's a USA show so I'm surprised that it's not on instant.  


































 I've got two pairs of prescription ray ban sunglasses and now I need a non script pair for when I wear contacts, not looking to spend another $200.

 We're staying about an hour south of SB but I'm going to go check out SBCC this week. Our entire group is coming. What can two high school seniors and four middle aged parents do in SB for a day? 









 How's it ride? How hard is it to build?  Is it comfortable for longer rides?

 So I saw some scratches on my car today located below the driver's side headlight.

http://imgur.com/a/eN8rO#0

I don't know what did it. There have always been scratches there, but I'm not sure if they were that bad. I feel like if I was hit/sideswiped at some point,  or conversely,  scratched someone else unknowingly then I there would be scratches above those. I do tend to pull forward pretty far when I park so it could be damage from a bush but I'm not sure. Any ideas? 
























 Are aviators and wayfarers still cool? 









 I'll be moving soon for college. The campus is sketchy to say the least... There are at least two days out of the year that I know for a fact I won't be able to keep my bike on campus, and there's still a lot of vandalism and theft and shit year round. Have any of you used a storage unit as a garage? I want to at least be able to take the bike out on weekends. I don't see why there would be any problems, but before I try to figure out the logistics I'd like r/motorcycle's opinion. 




 I'm not looking for anything difficult. Just looking for swooping curves and straights to really open the car up on. Preferably out in the country.  









 I had a Facebook friend "come out" as a polygamist today. He had recently been married but they got divorced. He is now in a relationship with a couple he met online.  



















 I tried to watch Dallas, the remake of the show about the oil family, and I made it about halfway through the first season before I gave up. My mistake may have been trying to binge it, but it felt like it was just dragging on and a bit overly dramatic. Should I give it another try?

 So I'll be attending a CCC in fall with the goal of transferring to a UC and becoming a resident. My parents will be sending me the maximum amount of money possible without claiming me as a dependent so that I can pay off tuition and housing. Now, my question is, once I become a resident can they claim me as a dependent again without putting me in danger of losing my in state tuition or residency?  




 I'm 18 and have about 100 lbs to lose, but the thought of having saggy skin for the rest of my life concerns me. I'm going to lose the weight regardless because that's a bigger issue, but as long as I'm at the very beginning stages of weight loss, are there any preventative measures I can take? I know I should take it slow, but I also want to lose as much as possible before college starts in august. 














 We've been debating for about 15 minutes now. I say no, he says yes, and the internet seems undecided. Unfortunately we're not able to test our respective hypotheses at the moment.  



















 I've never really understood it because nobody is actively promoting rape or saying it's ok, and rarely do people defend rapists. But the term "rape culture" implies (to me) that most of society is actively promoting, committing,  and defending rape. 




 I really wanted to go to a mid-top tier UC as a freshman, but alas it proved to be too hard to do as an out of state applicant. I have made the decision to attend SBCC and attempt to transfer to UCSB, USC, UCLA, or any other solid California school. In an attempt to squeeze the most enjoyment out of my few years of higher education I have also decided to stay in a private dorm (Tropicana Gardens). My concern is that I was going through some posts regarding SBCC on this sub, and it seems like SBCC students are discriminated against. Apparently they are even forced to wear a wrist band to get into Isla Vista (wtf? I didn't realize that IV is a gated community). Will being a CC student cause me much grief? I'm mainly going to SBCC so that I can transfer into a good school, but I'd be lying if I said that stuff like Deltopia didn't help me make my choice. I don't want to get kicked out of parties or hassled for being a CC student. So, what's the deal? Will I be able to live happily alongside you guys? 




 So I'm going to be visiting SB with my parents during spring break to check out Isla Vista, SBCC, and downtown SB. I'm looking for a place where I can rent a scooter or a small motorcycle so that I can kind of explore without my parents. The only place that comes up on google is Moto Loco, but their website doesn't seem to confirm that they rent any motorized two wheeled vehicles. Any ideas? 




 It is one of the best war documentaries that I have ever seen. It's as powerful as Restrepo. The premise is that a tight knit group of childhood friends enlist in the National Guard together. They are deployed to Afghanistan in 2008. The movie starts with them preparing for their deployment, but by far the most powerful part is that they interview the family members as well as the soldiers during their deployment. Finally, it follows their transition back into society and their struggle with PTSD. It'll make you want to cry, it'll make you want to laugh, and it'll make you angry.  

















































 So there's a really cool tour company located in Hawaii that I'm very interested in working at for a summer. A youtuber that I follow is friends with the owner and he is frequently featured in videos. I wouldn't work as a tour guide obviously, but if I sent him a resume with my qualifications and said that I'd be willing to do any job for near minimum wage, do you think I would get a response?

A bit about me, I'm in college and my work experience is limited. I'm studying business/marketing. 














 I was talking to a Hawaiian friend and he was complaining thaf nobody sells spam musubi here. Now I want to try it. 









 So I'm wondering if these are symptoms of depression and/or anxiety. [I posted a related question here yesterday](http://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1y1mg7/can_depression_cause_you_to_blur_or_confuse/)

So about six months ago a thought popped into my head. I won't say what it is because it makes me uncomfortable. Basically the thought was, what if I'm a (x)? From there it started spiraling out of control.  I couldn't get the idea that I'm a (x) out of my head. At first it was no big deal, but eventually whenever I started planning for my future (college, after college, etc) the thought would pop into my head and I would tell myself that I couldn't do the things I want to do for fear that I'm a (x) and won't be able to control myself. That made me sad, but I pushed on. Around two months ago (when i was at the peak of my depression) I had a horrible intrusive thought related to the idea that I'm a (x). Basically in reality the course of events went one way, but the intrusive thought took them another way. However, in the past day or so I haven't been able to separate the two in my memory. Consciously I know that one is false and the other is true,  but something in me keeps trying to convince me that the intrusive thought is reality,  which it is not. It's really messing with my head. 

I decided to test this problem I have with keeping reality and my thoughts separate. Minor stuff was easy. If I told myself that on Monday I went out to lunch with John when in reality I went with James, could always pick out the lie. Same with very major stuff like when I tried to convince myself that I didn't get a traffic ticket two years ago. But there were some things that happened anywhere from two months to two years ago that I consciously know which one is the truth and which is the lie, but something in me says otherwise. 


**TL; DR** 

Consciously I can separate truth from reality,  but somethinv between my conscious and my subconscious is trying to convince me that something I imagined is reality. 









 I suspect I have depression. I plan on getting checked or tested or whatever, but something peculiar has been happening to me recently. I seem to be mixing a memory with an intrusive thought that happened at the same time (a month and a half ago) as the event I'm remembering. Now, I know which one happened and which one was the intrusive thought, but they're slowly becoming less separate and I fear that if this continues that I wont be able to distinguish them in 5, 10, 20 years from now. Now, the event in question happened during a two week span in which I was more depressed than I had ever felt in my life. Like I was seriously fucked up. I had a lump in my throat the whole time, intrusive thoughts were happening multiple times a day, I was nervous the entire time, I nearly had panic attacks. It was the first time I had ever thought to myself "Fuck... I need to get help". I was even crying when I was by myself which is very unusual for me. Now, my second question is, once I'm on meds, or my depression is gone, will it be easier to distinguish memories? One of the reasons I'm sure that I have depression is that I'm only 18, yet all of my memories have been blurring together. Like on thursday I couldn't remember whether several events had happened on monday, tuesday, or wednesday.

 I've never been baptized or anything like that either.

 I've never owned a motorcycle but I've been wanting one for a while. Accidental broadcast has convinced me that owning a DS would be the bee's knees. I've got no more than 2750 to spend. Is there anything that's smaller than 500cc, reliable, and fun in that price range? I'm looking to do ~80% commuting and 20% trail, sand, forest type exploring. 

There's a '99 WR400F on Craigslist in my price range if you think that's worth getting.

 In the past if two countries were going to war with each other it was very easy for the respective Gov'ts to spread propaganda that demonizes the other country and it's citizens. Today I communicate with Europeans, Asians, and South Americans on reddit every day. I predict that most if not all of the wars involving first world countries for the rest of civilization as we know it will be fought against insurgents and disconnected third world countries. 









 I usually listen to the KNRQ morning show on 103.7 but lately I've been wanting to mix it up.  I don't really care about the music,  at least in the morning, I mainly listen for the banter. 









 She still doesn't think it's a good idea, but she agrees that squids inflate the crash data. [The findings can be found here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_findings_in_the_Hurt_Report)

Some interesting points:

23) Motorcycle riders with previous recent traffic citations and accidents are overrepresented in the accident data.

24) The motorcycle riders involved in accidents are essentially without training; 92% were self-taught or learned from family or friends. Motorcycle rider training experience reduces accident involvement and is related to reduced injuries in the event of accidents.

27) Almost half of the fatal accidents show alcohol involvement.

35) Motorcycle riders in these accidents were significantly without motorcycle license, without any license, or with license revoked.

43) Seventy-three percent of the accident-involved motorcycle riders used no eye protection.

44) Approximately 50% of the motorcycle riders in traffic were using safety helmets but only 40% of the accident-involved motorcycle riders were wearing helmets at the time of the accident.

55) Less than 10% of the motorcycle riders involved in these accidents had insurance of any kind to provide medical care or replace property.

 The term "mass shooting" has become synonymous with aimless killing, usually involving schools, or someone firing into a crowd. But I've noticed that recently many shootings that would have been reported on as gang violence five years ago are being called mass shootings. The same goes for murders perpetrated in a public place.  









 Victor Pride from [Bold and Determined](http://boldanddetermined.com/) does a great job of introducing people to nootropics, or life hacks as he calls them. He does an especially good job of [introducing people to Modafinil](http://boldanddetermined.com/2012/07/12/become-mighty-modafinil/). Here's the issue, he makes it seem like using nootropics, especially modafinil, will turn you into a Greek God capable of taking on armies and solving the riddles of the universe. He makes it seem like if you pop some modafinil today, then tomorrow you'll wake up as a billionaire. The issue is that when Victor Pride tells some kid that using Modafinil is going to be like using NZT-48, and it isn't, that kid is either going to tell everyone and their mother that nootropics are modern day snake oil, or he's going to try something stronger, like a high dose of adderall. I think that while he introduces people to nootropics, he is ultimately going to cause harm to the nootropics community. You've heard *my* opinion on the matter, but I'm genuinely curious to know what you think. I'm also curious to know if you think newcomers should be warned about him. 




 I've been saving up for a while now to get my first bike. I really want a WR250R, but they are so expensive used that I think I might just get another bike and trade it in when I get more funds. I found this Buell Blast:

http://www.cycletrader.com/listing/2009-Buell-Blast-110572701

I like the looks of the bike and I've come to the realization that I won't have any use for a D/S until I move to California in nine months, so maybe a street bike is just what I need. My concerns with the Buell is that they've been discontinued so parts will become scarcer and scarcer, I'm not sure how easy it is to get them serviced, and I'm not sure if it's as good a first bike as say a Ninja 300 or 500 or a CBR250R. I'd like your thoughts on the matter though. Buy this and ride it while I save up for a WR250R or just wait until I can afford the bike I want? 




 My evidence:

- The Mother has never been referred to in present tense by the narrator

- Whenever future Ted talks about her he sounds kind of sad. Definitely the whimsical, romantic Ted we've come to know and love.

- The last episode is titled "Last Forever"

- At the end of the last episode Ted makes a comment to the mother. "Nothing good happens after 2 AM (future Ted then interjects to say to his son, "except for you, luke)" before they set off to the hospital. After 2 AM.

- The producers decided on the ending early on. No matter how much they changed the plot around it wouldn't mess with an ending that results in her death.

- at the end of the "Time Travelers" episode Ted is seen pleading for more time with the mother. He wants 45 more days.

- The mother never narrates.

- She is never in any flash forward beyond 10 years or so. 




 Hey all! I'm new to this sub, but we recently had a men's rights victory at my school that I felt like sharing. My school has a daycare center that students are allowed to volunteer at. They receive credit for volunteering and if they do it for more than two semesters they become a paid employee. In the years prior to this school year, male student volunteers were not allowed to change diapers or escort the kids to the bathroom, even the boys. One of the male students saw the inequality in this and petitioned the parents of the daycare children to allow male students to change diapers and escort kids to the bathroom. He succeeded! 





























 Especially when it comes to things you wouldn't think to look up when driving in another state. Like lane splitting in CA or no right on red in NY.

 So I start college in the fall and they offer an EMT training/certification course. It's something I'm very interested in but I'm pretty out if shape. Lifting wise it's not that bad because I've been lifting for about 5 months now, but cardio and BF% wise I'm waaay out of shape. 237lbs, 5'9. But I have lost about 10lbs so far! Anyways would it be better to take the class and get certified once I'm more in shape or would I be good to go now? 









 Special thanks to /u/CongratsOnYourBike (and the rest of rideit) for [his advice](http://www.reddit.com/r/motorcycles/comments/2b5hl0/why_cant_i_use_the_clutch_properly_its_so/cj201cr). To be completely honest, I was about ready to write off motorcycles as a lost cause, but today was so fun once I got the whole pressing thing.

So I'm wondering how I can practice more. My instructors recommended that I come back and take the intermediate rider training or practice for awhile before I really try to hit the streets so I don't stall out in an intersection or something. I can work on all that friction zone stuff at my house, but to practice braking my issue is that the nearest large empty parking lot is a few miles away. Any ideas on what I should do? 




 So I just finished my first day of my MSF course and they've got me on a GN125. I can't get the clutch right. I'm either rocketing off the line uncontrollably or I stall out. I get off the line correctly about 50% of the time and the rest I'm just having trouble. Do you have any tips or tricks? The parking lot we're using is weird because it's sloped a bit so you have to apply more throttle depending on ehat side youre on. I need to improve clutch control because I really do not want to fail tomorrow and have to pay another 200 dollars. 









 Iirc the most dangerous place for motorcyclists is actually within the city, specifically in intersections. Which makes me wonder, why doesn't cycling have the same reputation as motorcycling? In the city a bicyclist is basically a slow motorcyclist with less protection.

 I found a 2000 KTM EX250 for $1825, but I can't tell you how many times I've seen someone make a joke about getting their buddy a tool kit with their KTM.

 So I'm looking for a sort of casual shoe/boot that could work with most outfits. I'm not the type of guy that wears kicks or leather boots. I primarily wear Nike frees, vans, and topsiders.

I'm open to suggestions though. I'm buying my first bike, a GS500E in a couple weeks. It's a standard/naked.

Edit:

Here's a bunch of different shoes and boots for motorcycling. I'm not looking to spend more than $150

The alternative being this GS500

http://eugene.craigslist.org/mcy/4558114417.html

I know these prices aren't great for these bikes but the local market isn't great either. To get cheaper prices I'd have to go to Portland and then ride the bike through portland and on the interstate for 2hrs which I'm not sure I'd be comfortable doing right off the bat.

So six months ago I wouldn't touch a salad with a ten foot pole and the only time I did anything that would get me out of breath was when I went up stairs quickly. 4 months ago I started a strength and conditioning class at my high school which got my mile time from a ~16:40 to a ~13:15, which is great! but I wasn't progressing fast enough! So, I go to the gym twice a day now! In the early afternoon I go do a 40-60 min cardio/light lifting workout, and on the way I stop and pick up a cobb or caesar salad and a bottle of water. Then in the evening I go do a 40-60 minute light cardio/heavy lifting session. I haven't been completely keeping track of my calories but I think I'm eating around 1800-2000 per day. I've been supplementing creatine and whey protein so that I can continue to build muscle mass while in caloric deficit. 









 I kind of want to try a [teatox](http://www.bootea.com/products/14-day-teatox), partly to prove to myself that I can, partly because I'm hoping that it'll clear my mind, and partly because I think a strict plan will help me cut calories.  









 So I'm starting at a CC in California and I noticed that they offer an EMT course and it got me thinking. Would it be possible to work as an EMT Basic and attend school full time? The primary ambulance company in the area is AMR btw. I figure I could take the EMT course this coming term, get fully certified over spring term and start working over the summer, assuming there's a job opening.

 I found one for 3k and I'm tempted to pull the trigger. Would it be too powerful or too unreliable or anything like that? Im 5'9, 230 lbs, riding experience is limited to the MSF course. 

Side note, most if the bikes I'm looking at are 70's/80's motorcycles, primarily British and Japanese, are old bikes just a bad idea in terms of reliability and safety?  
























 I've been to two gyms in my town (a YMCA, and a local athletic club) and neither have had an area to deadlift, nor have they had the big bumper plates. 






















































 Often times I'm in a rush and have little money so I'm forced to go to McDonald's, BK, or DQ. What are some healthy options from drive thru restaurants? I always skip the soda. Usually at mcdonalds I'll get the 10 pc mcnuggets with medium fries. At DQ I'll get the 6 piece chicken strip basket. At BK I'll get a burger and medium satisfries 




 So I've been bench pressing for about 4 months, and in that time I've also tried DB press at least once a week, but anytime I'm using dumbells that are actually hard to lift I have trouble balancing them and keeping my wrists from wobbling and keeping them in control through the rep. I don't  have this problem when I'm bench pressing. Any tips or advice?

 My favorite breakfast of champions is:

[1 scoop of Optimum Nutrition Oats and Whey](http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B002DYJ0K2?vs=1) - ~200 calories

10 oz of 1% milk - 125 calories (12.5 cal an oz)

1 banana - 105 calories

Blended all together gets you a surprisingly filling ~425 calorie chocolate banana breakfast shake. Toss it in your shaker and mix occasionally to prevent the protein powder from settling.

 So I've been lifting for about 3.5 months now and I'm at this kind of weird inbetween stage where I could really do either a beginner or intermediate workout. I'm looking for something that I can do 5-6 days per week. My primary goals are strength building, fat loss, and muscle growth. 

I'm so confused by the different workout plans and I have no idea how to decide. I've looked at a [P/P/L Routine](http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=149807833) but it seems like it'll leave you with an underdeveloped lower back. I've looked at [Cory Gregory's program](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/cory-gregory-fitness-360-lifted-up-training.html) and that one also looks good but I would probably have to sub out day 6 for a rest day. 




 I'm thinking about starting this now. This would be my first legitimate workout routine, previously I've just been following a loose list of lifts set up by the weightlifting teacher at my high school but I've just graduated so I figure I should start a legit program. My goals are fat loss, strength gains, and a bit of bodybuilding. 

Here's the workout:

http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=149807833

I'm concerned about underdevelopment of the lower back woth that program but I figure I can just do the variant that includes deadlifts. 

I'm also eyeing this program, but it might be a bit much. If I did it I think I'd sub out the 500 and 1000 rep days for cardio days.

 I've seen a lot of bodybuilder bro science that says 1-2gallons per day (how is that even possible???) But I'm having to dig pretty deep to get a legit answer. Anyone know? 









 Would using protein powder work to help me lose weight? My plan is to use it as a meal for breakfast and occasionally other meals if I'm in a rush. The stuff I'm looking at is 120 cal/24g protein/1g sugar per serving so I figure it's healthy enough and the protein will fill me up nicely while also help in me take a nice chunk out of my calories. I do lift and have been doing so for about 4 months.

Edit: 

Secondary question,  for meal replacement would it be better to use whey or casein? 




 I'm trying to lose weight but I don't want to lose my gains. Would it work for me to take creatine for a week every once in a while or a few days a month so that I can pack on some muscle without getting the water weight side effect of regular creatine use? 














 My doctor put me on 150mg of welbutrin about 3 months ago and it worked for a while but it seems like my depression is coming back. Not as badly as before but it's definitely there. I'm going off to college im two and a half months so do you think it'd be best to ask my doctor to bump me up to 300mg or to wait and ask the college medical center? 




 I was doing modified dips yesterday, feet up on a bench and hands on boxes on either side of me, and after the first rep my collarbone started hurting like a bizatch. I could only do one more before the pain became unbearable. It hurt for about ten minutes afterwards and then went away and I continued my workout, even doing bench press with no problem. I chalked ut up to me being heavy and not having trained for that exercise before. Today though my left collarbone has a slightly dull pain when I move my left arm or head. Can DOMS occur around your clavicle after dips or do I have another problem?

At the time of the workout the pain was probably a 7/10, now it's a 2 or 3/10

 So I'm looking for a low calorie/carb/fat/sugar, high protein powder that I can use to supplement small meals. My goal is to cut weight. Here's my problem though, protein powder brands are confusing as fuck. I've been told that muscle milk is straddling the line between a genuine protein powder and a full meal replacement powder. That's the only brand I actually know of and I'm wary of consuming powders from a ranfom source.  
























 Material,  graphic lifespan, etc 









 It's a modification of your standard bench press sets. I put my usual BP weight, 25 each side, on the bars using 5lb plates. I do 10 reps for each set, and remove 10lbs after every set. For the last three sets I increase the number of reps by 5 so that on my very last set I'm doing 25 reps with just the bar. My friend that showed it to me called it a burnout but I've come to learn that a burnout is something else. 




 I've been lifting for about 3.5 months now. Gained a bit of muscle, haven't lost any weight. I'd rather lose weight than gain muscle but doing both would be a huge plus.  




 Idk if you guys saw but the Daily Nexus released a list of all the Guachos that died this year. 11 total. It also makes me wonder just how many Isla Vistans die every year. I think that every year on either may 23 or may 28 we should have a paddle out to honor all those that fell on that tragic day and all those that die each year in Isla Vista.

 "I mean, they say you die twice. One time when you stop breathing and a second time, a bit later on, when somebody says your name for the last time."

Let's not give that monster what he wanted. Let his second death happen when the last reporter utters his name. However, let's make sure the people that died at his hands live on forever.  




 Anyone want to get the ball rolling on this?

Here is an article on the shooting:

http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/isla-vista-rampage/gunman-kills-least-six-uc-santa-barbara-shooting-spree-n113931

Summary: A SBCC student tired of being rejected by women decided to have his "day of retribution." He stabbed his three roommates, ~~all believed to be chinese exchange students~~ two of whom were exchange students and one was an American, and then went on a shooting spree in Isla Vista where he intended to kill sorority girls. He ended up killing two sorority girls and one male UCSB student. 7 other people were wounded either due to bullet wounds or being hit by his car. The shooter wrote a 140 page manifesto detailing his hatred of women and outlining his plan to get revenge on society. He also posted a video on YouTube which is essentially a condensed version of his manifesto. 





























 I wouldn't mind a bit of dropkick murphys or blink 182.  And Radical Something even has a song about us 









 Didn't go, anyone got pics or vids so I can see why I too should be obsessed? 














 The only way I could get it to turn off was by removing the battery which I've done twice but that didn't work. 




 I want to work on a ranch next summer doing work like mending fences, digging irrigation, herding cattle, but I've got no experience in agriculture. Honestly, I kind of want to do this because being a cowboy sounds like a fun adventure, even if it requires doing a lot of dirty work. Next summer will be after my freshman year of college, what kind of part time work can I get to help build my resume for this? Currently I've got a line on a construction job. What websites advertise these jobs? I'd prefer to work in Wyoming, Montana, or Colorado at a larger ranch. Thanks for your help! And I apologize if the answers seem obvious to you guys but this whole industry is confusing to a kid that grew up in a city.  









 IE: scumbag steve type posts, bad luck brians, good guy gregs, etc 




 I was telling my friend about a forearm tattoo I want to get that has lettering and he was saying that typically a forearm tattoo has the bottom facing the wrist and the top facing the elbow which seemed counter intuitive to me because I wouldn't be able to read my own tattoo without putting my arm in an awkward position.  












































 I know that we're considered one of the most bike friendly cities especially due to the bike lanes they add whenever they repave streets, but it seems exceedingly dangerous,  especially because a lot of bikers don't follow the rules of the road. I've seen one biker get hit in my years here, and I've been in and seen plenty of near misses. Just today I was walking on the bike path by SEHS and I saw some kid fly into the parking lot at 10-15 mph and nearly get hit by a car that didn't see him.

Until Eugene expands the bike path a bit more I'm afraid that I'll always view them as a bit of a nuisance.  














 I've never really been on campus at night but last week I was driving around campus at 11 o'clock on a friday night and I was surprised that I didn't see any house parties during my travels. I'm obviously nit planning on dropping in, but I've heard that there's one street that has a bunch of parties.  









 So I'm a fat ass but I've started taking a strength and conditioning class to get in shape and lose weight. Running hurts my back like a bitch. I think I need to lose more weight before I can actually run. Should I use an elliptical, or bike, or some other stationary machine instead? 

Lifting is no problem although I did jack my back up doing SL deadlifts but it's almost back to normal now. 














 Basically are there any that are not massive fast food chains? 





























 Sweet thanks! If you don't mind my asking, who do you buy from? I'm leaning towards onemedstore but I kinda like the discretion provided by bitcoin. 




 I think the more concerning failure rate is for the 7ft wall test 




 Eh kind of. MEPS is supposed to filter out those that are medically unable to serve. They don't really check your physical strength or anything like that there.  




 I'm planning on buying 30 to start and then I might purchase 90 if I like the stuff and that should hopefully past me through the school year at which point I'll see about getting a prescription from my doctor back home. 

The three sizes intended for envelopes are

35.5 in

5x5.5 in

11x5.5 in 




 The problem is that for several of the tests the failure rate for men is at or below 1%, whereas for women it's in the 10s or 20s. Fiscally speaking, it would be irresponsible to pursue this if half way through training a quarter of the women get dinged out. 




 I took it freshman year of high school for about six months but I remember it not doing much for me. Gave me headaches though.  




 What dude your post history involves grow advice, questions about tor, and references to smoking weed several times.  









 Bro. Double double and animal fries. 




 Yaaaaasssssss 




 The article I found said that he mostly did this over the course of his senior year so I think it's safe to assume that he was 18 for at least some of it. 




 I'm shocked!  SHOCKED I SAY! 




 OP deliver with pics 




 Younger than 16 is actually very serious and should be treated as such. We're talking about a freshman in high school. What you neglect to mention, or didn't read, is that he did this to **10 different kids**, not to the same girl ten different times, and he intended to share the films. By your own standard he's getting off easy at 2.5 years per victim.

Edit: I should add that I didn't know this guy. I graduated from SEHS this year, but the general attitude among seniors was that freshman girls are off limits. They're basically kids. Hell, some of them aren't done with puberty or have even started it for that matter.  




 Yeah I'll definitely talk to a transfer counselor to get the specifics.  I think my total GPA is still above 3.65 but I'll have to double check. If I kill this year I can raise that though.  









 So I'm currently attending SBCC (Isla Vista FTW) and I love it here but after spending some time exploring the UCSB campus I've decided that that's no longer my first choice for transferring. I'm also really enjoying my investing class so I figure I might enjoy a business related career. 

So here's the thing, I've looked through my credits and I've taken almost all of the courses required by Cal. I just need to take a 19 credit load next semester to finish up the reqs. Of all of the UC transferable courses I've  taken I've gotten mostly A's with a few B's mixed in there, but my non-UC transferable courses are mostly B's. The transfer website says that they only calculate your GPA based on your UC transferable courses. Can someone with experience in this tell me if my non-UC transferable courses are going to hurt my chances? I'm not sure if what they're saying on the website means that they totally ignore those courses or that they look at them but don't consider them as much in their final decision.  




 Like armodafinil is OTC in Canada?

 Weed maybe but that's because it literally grows on trees. Everything else is far more difficult to get than alcohol in my experience.  




 I'm not sure I understand your complaint. I summarized the situation and provided the relevant quote.  









 That's not disregard. Disregard would be seeing a school bus full of children go into a lake and say fuck it someone else will eventually call the cops and go on with your day. This is pure unadulterated psychopathic hatred for humanity. 




 Here's anothe awesome pond in Oregon.  It's called blue pool and you can go cliff diving there. I think it's about a 45 min drive + 5 mile hike from Eugene.

 Oct 4th I believe 




 Oh and just a reminder, the gopro hero 3's software and some if its hardware was absolutely terrible when it came out so let the camera junkies mess around with it for a few days and give feedback before you pull the trigger.  




 Comes out on October 4th so we won't know for sure until then but it's essentially a very bland gopro. Just press the top button and it'll turn on and record. Hold it and it will take time lapse shots. Records in 1080p at 60fps or 720p at 30fps and auto adjusts for light conditions. If you just need something to cover your ass in case a driver does something retarded or you want to record track days then this is a good choice. If you're looking to record fancy videos for a documentary or highlight video or whatever it will do but the GoPro hero 4 or Hero 3 will give you a broader range of recording options. 




 Why? For most division one starters on good teams football *is* a major. It leads to a job, and one that will pay more than you'll earn in a life time at that.  




  How the fuckity fuck fuck can someone get a fucking education when they spend an entire semester training and practicing to play fucking football

By putting in work. All of these kids playing div 1 football know what they're getting themselves into. Likely their varsity teams in high school had incredibly rigorous training programs. Some of them like Jonny Manziel take easy course loads because they know they'll go pro. Some of them like Colt Lyerla do that and fuck up. And some of them like Marcus Mariota, arguably the best div 1 QB right now, put in work. Marcus Mariota earned a general science degree in three years. Now he's taking a lax course load for his senior year so that he can get drafted. 

Here's a list of Oregon players from the 2019 season that were honored academically.

 Why? 




 Saying wtf doesn't have to be out of disgust. It could be a quizzical wtf. Honestly tho, how much time do you people spend on reddit if you're critiquing semi off topic posts and slight misuse of memes?

 Honestly it depends. Girls in high school have a much easier time getting laid. If the teacher was disgusting or maybe even just average looking I'd probably be singing a different tune, but if he was a moderately attractive guy I wouldn't. I know my high school self would've jumped at a chance to geg with a teacher because I sure as shit wasn't getting any elsewhere.  




 That depends on if there's an implication of consequences for not having sex. It'd be rape for my boss to say she'll fire me if I don't fuck her, or my schools president to say she'll expel me. But if either of them just say "wanna fuck?" It's not illegal. No matter how unprofessional. If this kid had been 17 these teachers would be out of a job. Not facing jail time.  




 There are only 12 US states where they have to be 18 before it's legal for an adult to have sex with them. In the other 38 it's either 16 or 17. This is not some terrible crime that's only legal in the hick country. In most states the only thing wrong here is a lack of professionalism. 

http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ages_of_consent_in_North_America 




 16 is not a child. That's the age of consent in most states.  




 It has as much to do with the attractiveness of the perpetrators as it does the gender. If these women were hags it'd say race. If it were some bradley cooper looking motherfucker it'd say sex. Honestly though, what heterosexual sixteen year old male would turn down a three way with these two?

 What other reason is there for someone with a mobile body and sound mind to commit suicide? 




 What was irrational about my comment? The fact that modern medicine means that you can end mental suffering without suicide?  




 There is not a single person on earth that has thought about suicide, seeked help, and regretted not going through with it after the fact. Medication, therapy, whatever. There are things that work to combat depression in the modern realm of medicine. And I don't give a fuck what people say, suicide is fucking selfish. No matter how much you believe otherwise there will be somebody that is seriously affected by your suicide and you may have unknowingly sent them on the road to suicide.  




 Because they're not even facing a problem yet. It's a fucking preemptive measure. Euthenasia should be for true incurable pain and suffering. Not depression and sadness,  and definitely not expected depression and sadness. 




 There are very few reasons for which I think assisted suicide should be allowed. This, this is not one of them.

 Snowden is a narcissist and a traitor. He has been caught lying about so many things that I don't trust a word out of his mouth at this point.

 A bit about me: I currently go to SBCC and live in Isla Vista. After talking to my transfer counselor I've learned that I can probably transfer to USC and start as a sophomore in the fall of 2015 if I take certain classes this spring. USC was actually my second choice behind UCSB but I didn't get into either and I decided to TAG into UCSB rather than attend one of the four years I did get into. 


* Enough about me though, what I'm wondering is, how is the greek life at USC compared to the scene on DP here in IV? Am I going to feel let down by it after I've experienced Halloween and Deltopia? 

* Coming from a middle class family that hasn't done anything spectacular,  what are my chances of actually getting a bid from a good fraternity? (My cousin is an ATO so that could be cool).

* Does the USC campus have a college town vibe or does it feel like you're in a big city?

Thanks! 




 if you want a device to get things done, to not play with - Blackberry is what you get.

That was true like 5 or 6 years ago when the blackberry waa making the only widely produced phone that resembled a smartphone and had a full keyboard but nowadays it doesn't matter. Iphone, Galaxy,  it doesn't matter because they all have business apps, full keyboards, and ease of use. If you just want to do business then any of the major smartphones will work for you just about equally.

 I crashed my bike today and now my confidence is a bit shot.I haven't ridden regularly for about four years and I bought the bike on Thursday to get around school and I've ridden it pretty much everyday since and I've loved it! However, tonight I was going for a ride and asi pulled away from the stop sign I stood up and pedaled which threw me off balance and caused me to crash in the middle of the street. Honestly I'm lucky I was under a street light so the oncoming car saw me and stopped. I managed to get away with a few minor scrapes on my elbow and what feels like a bruised rib. My main problem is I'm embarrassed, my confidence is shot, and I'm a bit scared to go riding again. Any advice?

I am not looking forward to that. Between the 3.5 million semi truck drivers, 233k taxi drivers, 650k+ bus drivers, and the rest of the driving jobs in the US, commercial self driving car technology is an unemployment time bomb waiting to explode. This is the one technology that I truly think needs to have sanctions placed on it for commercial use. 




 Another one here 




 That's the issue. I can't be there for him. We go to different colleges now and his new "experienced" friends came up with the idea to try edibles. I'm honestly worried about him getting that high with people stupid enough to give a first timer an edible. I gave him advice like eating a full meal beforehand? only taking a bite and giving it time to kick in, but I can just tell that this is going to go south. 




 So my friend has decided to get high for the first time, I personally don't have a problem with this. I do have a problem with his method however. For his first high ever he will be using edibles.......... I told him that this is a terrible idea and he should smoke for his first time because it'll be easier to control his intake level but he refuses and says I'm iver reacting.

 Fuck I miss oregons friendliness. It's just not the same down here in socal. 




 Mine resistant has become a buzz word for the police militarization crowd. When looking at MRAPs the key word for police is armored. If you're rolling up to an active shooter situation in a squad car you're in for a bad time. The fact of the matter is that even a .22 can penetrate every part of a car except the engine block. 

[Here is a video if a .22lr and common pistol rounds being tested on a car door](http://youtu.be/lkYBd9p3b8M). Whether it fits your agenda or not you need to admit that it's well within reason for police departments to own an armored vehicle.  




 So where are the people that launched the original story alleging police corruption to the front page less than 3 hours after it was posted? Where are the 4k+ upvotes? 




 That's just ridiculous.  Everyone knows that the Internet was invented by Bill Gates and Steve Job when they were in college.

 That's backwards retarded and completely misleading. Those rules of engagement are to some extent unique to the US, and were set by Obama. Before 2010, when the Taliban was still using gunfire as a common tactic, it was fire on people that were threats, especially in close quarters areas. Something else to think about:

 Not really. Nobody even needed to reload. They all probably just dumped a 13ish round mag which would be reasonable if they were by themselves. It takes a matter of seconds to shoot a magazine that size. They may not have realized that all of them were shooting in that time.  




 If you wamt to do that then you include all, but if you want to use at as a measurement of the probability of the success of your marriage as the guy I was replying to was, then you don't. Got it? 




 If you're going into combat with a bunch of 180lb men you should be able to carry at least one of those men on your back. The current standards for men is what the army has decided proves that you are in good enough shape to do that and anything else that gets tossed at you in a war zone. War is not about fairness. It's not about letting a 100lb feminist play dress up and pound her chest while saying she can do a man's job. If she truly wants to go to war she needs to be able to prove that she can pull her own weight and the weight of anybody that gets in a jam while they're out in that war zone.

 So I'm making my first weed purchase tomorrow and I'm wondering if I'll need a ziploc or jar or something to contain the scent once I bring it back to my dorm. The RAs have a see it, smell it, hear it policy for checking people.  














 So I've moved to a new town for college and I've been having a bit of trouble making friends and the few friends I have made are pretty straight edge. But I've always had a bit of an interest in weed so I'd like to try it for the first time. I've met a dealer but he's a bit of an asshole and definitely not someone I really want to spend much time with. 









 I'll update with pics later, but essentially there's a pink area that extends out to where the plastic surgeon did the electric cauterization and then there's a grayish area where the original mole was. I'm slightly worried that the doctor may have missed some and that it'll regrow.

Edit: kind of grainy but here are pics

 So here's the deal, I've got a mole in the middle of my face and it's always bugged me and I want to get it removed before I go to college. I had an appointment with a dermatologist and they referred me to a plastic surgeon because they couldn't get the scar to flow with the natural lines of my face. The plastic surgery place was slow to get back to me and it's now a week and a half from the time I leave for college and I'm just now getting the appointment set. I originally wanted to have the procedure done here abd then have a doctor in my college town remove the stitches, but it seems like that might not even be possible at this point,  so if I had a consult here would the doctor be able to send his notes to a doctor in my college town so I could have it done right when I arrive or is that unlikely/illegal/impossible etc?

Edit:

Conversely, is it possible to have the procedure and consult done in the same appointment?  




 I was helmet shopping and the store owner was hard selling me a high viz kabuto kamui. The price is around $250 and it seems like a decent helmet. It's got the eye glasses insert port things, a drop down sun visor, an antifog insert, and a quick clip chin strap thing. 

Apparently the company is new to the US so the products are being sold more cheaply than they normally would. The guy at the store basically said that they're only a step below Shoei.

Is that true? If it is then it seems like a pretty good deal but I'm not sure.  




 A couple weeks ago I overhead a conversation at the DMV but it's just now dawning on me how amazing this guy is.

 So I arrived at the DMV and took my number. Usual DMV shit. I've got like a 90 minute wait time. I go take a seat and end up eavesdropping on a conversation that's happening behind me. It's this 20 something black kid talking to a 40 something Hispanic dude with a fairly thick accent. They're shooting the shit and doing the normal small talk thing and the hispanic guy gets around to asking the kid what he does. The kid says that he usually works construction but hasn't been able to find a job lately. They talk a bit about construction and then the hispanic guy tells the kid how to apply for a job at McDonald's and how it's a great place and whatnot. At this point I'm sorta rolling my eyes and thinking what the fuck is this guy talking about. The kid says he's applied everywhere and no one is hiring. The hispanic guy says to apply to a specific McDonald's location and that he can get the kid some hours. At this point the kid asks how he can do that and the hispanic guy replies that he's the owner of that location. The kid asks how that came to be and the hispanic guy says that his family immigrated to California ehen he was about 10. During high school he knocked up his girlfriend and took a job at McDonald's to pay all the bills. He worked at McDonald's for 20 years before he was promoted to manager and after 5 more years he had saved up enough money to purchase a franchise location. 


I'm blown away. I look at my life and myself and I know I couldn't do that. I couldn't work at a fast food restaurant for 20 years to support my family. That man is a better man than me and he's only ever worked at fucking McDonald's.  









 So I picked up a high viz kabuto kamui today for $250 and now I'm off to check out bikes. The guy said that it's one of the better helmets in the price range, which I believe. He also said that it's of Shoei quality but since it's new to the US it's not as pricey yet. Not sure how true that is, but I'm happy with my purchase!  




 So the basic strength test is that you need to lift a stretcher loaded w/ a 150lb person with help. That's easy enough with deadlift training but I was talking to some EMTs and some people over in /r/ems and they said that deadlifts are all fine and good, but more often than not you're not going to have time or room to use proper DL form and I'll be carrying the stretcher in awkward positions on stairwells and stuff. So that said, I'm doing Coolcicada's PPL right now, but I want some suggestions for a workout that will strengthen all the little muscles in my back so I don't snap it if I'm lifting a 210lb dude from a weird position.  




 I just moved to town and I'm looking for a place to gamble. Primarily hold 'em and blackjack. How is the gambling there? Are they fair (or at least as fair as you expect a casino to be) or is it kind of shady? 




 I'm looking for a place with a large selection, particularly of helmets, but most of the places in the area seem to be smaller gear stores attached to bike dealers. I know I can order from revzilla but I prefer buying helmets in person 




 So I'm in a car doing 45 on a four lane road and I've got a car in front of me, a motorcyclist slightly behind in the lane next to me and a car in front of the motorcyclist. This van is coming up behind me doing 55-60 and the car in front of me decides to slow down to turn right. Well, the van doesn't see us slowing until the last second so to avoid rear ending me he swerves into the left lane still going ~55. The motorcyclist somehow sees him at the last second and guns it while swerving into the space in front of me.

If that motorcycle didn't have that reaction time I would be telling a different story. Stay safe out there. 







































 I did everything you're supposed to do. I showered after every workout. I changed clothes after workouts. I dried my shit off after every shower. But one day I fucked up. It was a particularly hot day (95ish F) and I did my usual mid day cardio workout. I was in a rush so I skipped my post workout shower and went straight to my next location. I then went to my afternoon weightlifting sesh and ran into my buddy. We got to talking and I ran out of time so I skipped the shower again. The next day I pop in the shower and **HOLY MOTHER OF JESUS WHAT THE FUCK.** My left thigh and the left side of my balls were burning like a mother fucker. Now I've gotta spend 2-4 weeks using antifungal cream on my junk before my shit stops burning or I can have sex that isn't painful and embarrassing. 


Be careful ladies (yes you too) and gentlemen. This stuff sucks. 
























 Because this wasn't an OD in the sense you're talking about. If my doctor prescribed my a lethal dose of oxycodone then he probably would be charged with malpractice and maybe even negligent homicide. This however, happened because someone was selling adulterated pills. In all likelihood these people took what would have been a non-lethal dose of mdma but it ended up containing enough of the adulterant to kill them. 














 Front or back. Think of your head as a clock 




 Almost like nobody wants to do salvia, and if they do do it they never want to do it again 




 It's in late January.  I don't think so but my doctor has been considering getting me off them soon so maybe I'll wait until EDC to hang with molly 




 I've been digging Galantis lately, check out Runaway (U   I). So Young So High by Dada Life is pretty good too. Oooh and Colors by Tobu. That's all EDM but it doesn't have the insane bass drops.  




 So I've been taking welbutrin for a bit less than a year now -150mg XL (extended release?) and I'm planning on rolling for the first time at an upcoming festival. The interactions page on erowid cautions about how welbutrin can alter the effects of mdma but doesn't really go much more into it. Is there anything I should be worried about? I went through an extremely depressed phase for about four months before I started taking welbutrin and it helped immensely. I occasionally miss a dose but it doesn't cause any noticeable changes when it happens. 




 I think that's a pen or something like that 




 Looking for a place to take a buddy for his 20th 




 A lot of states eother already have or are adopting an 8.50ish minimum wage. Assuming 8.59hrs a day552 we get just under 20k. If they work six days a week we get 23k.  




 Honestly that's verging on lower than full time minimum wage pay in a lot of states so if you're salaried w/out commission at that then you're getting gypped to hell. 




 What about mephedrone? 




 I just went on the edc website to buy tickets for edc vegas 2015 and it says it tickets are unavailable. Is it sold out or what's the deal? 




 I read the same thing. Seems a bit ridiculous though.  Nicotine, caffeine, adderall, even exercise,  are going to more effective with much less risk. 




 Most people use "dab" rigs. Which can either be a their own smoking device or just a something that replaces the bowl piece on a bong. You'll heat up the concentrate with a torch lighter usually. Concentrates can also be vaped. 




 Im motivated as fuck right now so tomorrow I'm gonna get a fresh mile time 




 I haven't been able to do a full body pushup since middle school or maybe even elementary school and I just fucking did one! It's 1am and I started thinking to myself "You've gotten stronger and you've lost 40lbs, I bet you can do a pushup" and I got onto the floor in my boxers and fucking did one. 




 I know of all of those except for bordeaux (although after googling it I've found that it's the size of a small US city so that makes sense). I also could point them out so long as borders were drawn on the map because I actually paid attention in geography class. 




 Op is probably a nurse 









 Yes. As far as I know it's *only* legal for **certain** tribes to use in the process of a religious ceremony.  




 18 year old here. That's definitely not true.  




 So I bit off more than I could chew and decided to take a course without taking the skill advisory course beforehand. Couple that with an absolutely horrific professor and it being my first semester of college and I kind of fucked up. I'm at SBCC right now and trying to TAG UCSB and apply to Berkeley L S and UCLA. Can this course hurt my chances/void my TAG or am I good? It's not UC transferable.  I'm expecting a C or a D. 




 There aren't exactly many non-corporate cell phones nowadays and they've become somewhat of a necessity in this day and age.  




 I just don't get them. All of my friends talk about weird shit when they're stoned but even at an [8] I only really feel it in my body with the exception of being really happy. 




 Banging coke or shooting smack on a regular basis is much more dangerous than morbid obesity. Dabbling in shit like weed and MDMA and psychedelics is not. 




 No. It's not. Go to any college campus in the US and you can find an addy source in 10 minutes if you really look.  




 I know that dance safe sells mdma test kits maybe they have one for coke 




 Except for the two assholes that have the tips of their noses showing. They just look silly 




 It's for packing the bowl down as you're milking it 




 HOW DO YOU DO THAT ON YOUR LAPTOP [7] 




 And it's almost like you missed the *shred of normality* part 




 I wouldn't chill with someone if I found out they got a sexualized horse tatted on their bicep 




 You should though because it means that someone doesn't get to have thanksgiving with their family. 




 Alright, does devoid of friends with a shred of normality work for you? The moment summer comes around and she puts on a tank top they're gone. 




 What's gamergate? 




 I like to take a walk by myself to smoke a j before bed

 He posted another picture of a guy "cleaning up after the riots" that was wearing the same letters. My guess is that this is some sort of guerrilla advertising for the Alpha Omega Theta frat 




 That have those! I saw a uh documentary about one... 









 Lorde makes me uneasy 




 Honestly I got a plain black leather wallet with an O pressed into it at the duck store for $20 and it's lasted through four years of daily use now 




 Nah op just needs to send him the key 




 So for the past two weeks, and occasionally throughout the past couple of months, what I've been doing is drinking water throughout the day and maybe having a power bar or something like that and then just eating dinner. I find that it's easier for me to not snack during the day when I can distract myself from my hunger than at night when I'm trying to go to bed. So I usually eat a 1000-1500 calorie dinner that can keep me stuffed. Will this adversely affect my weight loss or is it effectively the same as eating three 500 calorie meals a day without snacking?  I'm 18/M/5'9/210ish lbs. 




 Unfortunately (lol) I'm in socal 




 I want a cb300f so bad but I'm also hoping to get ABS. Kinda sucks that that's not an option for those 




 There's a bong I really want (A medicali slyme!) but it's $200 so I'm waiting in the hopes that grass city will have a cyber Monday sale.  




 After going on their locator and filtering to only include stores with gas stations I've found that there are five in Oregon, several in Washington, and several in every major city in california.  




 I haven't had the chance to ride one yet but I REALLY want the black and yellow model. 




 You can camp on most of the channel islands 




 IV reppin over here 




 Never seen one with a gas station out here on the west coast. 




 I've lived in California and Oregon and never seen one with a gas station 




 7-11 has gas stations? 




 I dont think they can ding you for being well hydrated. If you eat salty stuff it'll help keep your piss yellow 




 They're probably carrying some a glock of some sort. 15-22 rounds depending on what kind  




 you cant really speak on the matter because you've never been in combat. Everything I've read says that you sort of lose count when you go into flight or fight and just shoot. It also wouldn't take more than 10 seconds to shoot 14 rounds so it's not an obscenely high amount. 




 How do you like that medicali bubbler? 




 You're probably fine but I would drink a bunch of water until then just to be safe. Just carry a water bottle with you wherever you are and refill it whenever you can. Try to get clear piss haha 




 I've gotten the spins twice now and it's terrible. Don't know what causes it. 




 How are you inhaling? You need to draw the smoke and then open your mouth and inhale air. That should force the smoke that's in your mouth and throat into your lungs. 




 Thanks! 5'10 









 I did but they're always ripping tobacco out of that bong so I mightve got some left over stuff from the bottom of the bowl. 




 So I'm not a stoner by any means. I'm rather new to this whole world, but usually it takes me about two bong hits to get me decently stoned. Last night however I took a super small bong hit and things started out normal. After about 5 minutes though I started getting pretty dizzy and when I walked my legs tingled. After I came down 2ish hrs later I noticed that my hands were kind of shaky when I was playing 2048. 




 I've always described it as: an alternate timeline in which Robin and Ted had stayed together right from the get go

 They're down voting because people that care about what meme you use, unless it's just absolutely retardedly wrong, are annoying as fuck.

 I mean for most "major" weight losses you'll be left with loose skin. It can go away, especially if you're young and it's your first time losing and all that jazz but for a lot of people it doesn't go away unfortunately.  




 Isn't that a bit sketchy? I feel like if there are any complications it'd be better to be in the US. 




 Those girls are making pennies on every dollar that people drop in their rooms. I can't tell you how many times I've heard popular cam girls complaining about bills or talking about a day job. I sincerely doubt that there are more than a few camgirls making excessive amounts of money.  




 That's some CSI shit right there 




 I get what you're saying. I suffered through depression for most of my senior year of high school.  I honestly considered killing myself a couple times. I was lucky in that the first antidepressant i tried with my doctor worked. If you have access to modern medical care then I think that you should try every antidepressant available to you before you consider killing yourself. At the same time, I recognize that what I went through is no life worth living. If you've exhausted your options and can't get out of that depressive state then, and only then, do I think you should be given the opportunity to commit assisted suicide.  




 The people taking it are usually uneducated villagers from rural china that truly believe in old fashioned eastern medicine. They don't deserve to die because the chinese gov't is doing a poor job at educating them about modern medical techniques and dispelling the myths of ancient medicine.  




 So why can't the federal rulings on gay marriage that have been happening be applied universally to overturn all gay marriage bans? 




 Definitely not. Kinda looks like she has an EDM/rave type outfit on. 




 No it moves like a handheld camera 




 I honestly didn't even think about it. The first time I ever smoked weed there was tobacco in the bowl for the third hit I took but I didn't rip a full bowl. The people I was with would take a hit and give me the bong to clear the rest. This time was only my third time smoking weed and I figured that it wouldn't be too different but it just completely fucked me up. My friend says I took way too big of a hit. I milked it all the way up the bong before pulling the bowl. I still feel a bit anxious and my tounge still feels weird but I'm doing better. I skipped my classes for the day to recover. 




 No I don't think he did. I'm just concerned because I still feel off and it's been almost 17 hours. I feel slightly dizzy and lightheaded 




 Oh I know the weed wasn't laced as I've smoked from that batch before. I was worried because i didn't pack my own bowl. It was packed by a friend's friend that does molly and adderall and he got the tobacco out of a sack he has pinned to the wall. 




 Well the recreational shops won't be open until July but you can probably ask around more openly for some weed now 




 Yeah it sucked. I'm still feeling kind of anxious and my tounge still wants to be on the roof of my mouth but otherwise I'm feeling better. I felt terrible yesterday tho. It was bad enough that I honestly thought that it had been spiked with something else for a bit. 




 It wasn't my very first time. I've had cugs a few times before. Usually they give me a headrush and I'm good. I live in a dorm so I was over at a friends place a few doors down when they offered to make me a chop. I still feel off and a bit nauseous and nervous today 




 Oh shit I just woke up after falling asleep maybe 30 min after I posted this. Hopefully I can elaborate a bit better now and you guys can maybe tell if this is a normal reaction. So I took a hit of a bowl loaded with weed and tobacco. Almost immediately I felt like I was going to throw up. I managed to walk back to my room and then the room started spinning. My whole body felt super tickly and numb. I also couldn't stop putting my tounge to the roof of my mouth and my teeth were clenched and it felt like I had stomach acid on the back of my throat.

 It's still happening. Clenching teeth. Tounge feels hot. Body tingling. Room spinning 




 It's worse. I cant control my tounge 









 I do care about quality. I don't have $400 to spend on glass though.  




 A sad attempt at less than a quarter of the price. Not everyone can drop hundreds on glass. 




 I'm looking at this one. Also is grass city discreet with their packaging? It'd have to go through the dorm mail system and my roommate might end up accepting the package and he's antiweed.

 Box is balanced precariously on the vertical stick. Cat touches the horizontal stick which is tied to the vertical and it knocks the box off balance.  




 maybe one of the fucks down voting me could explain why?

Because it's not a blanket term. You wouldn't say that nigger is a derogatory term for white people would you? It's like a worse way of calling a woman a bitch. Yes, we call men bitches too but the meaning and offensiveness is different when directed at a woman.  




 It's the fact that he used it in a professional context that makes it bad. Especially because I assume that OP is American and it's a rather derogatory term for women here. The punishmwnt is retarded tho. 




 But he plead for no jail time so everything you just said is irrelevant.

 Animals that were raised on GMO feed would not be labeled when sold as meat, nor would their dairy.  




 I ended up voting no. I don't think GMO labeling is the greatest idea and the way the bill is written doesn't really help the pro labeling side as much as they'd like either

 I think they changed the rule a month or two ago. It was initially implemented to stop people from linking askreddit comments but i guess they decided to undo the blanket ban.

 I haven't been in eug for a few months but I think I remember her being a shorter lady. Possibly with a hunchback.  




 So last night around ~10 I went out with a friend and we smoked with some people using a bong. I hit it twice with just a bit of smoke left in it and it didn't do much and then the third time I took a pretty big hit that gave me a nice body high and a bit of a head high. About 45 minutes later I went home and crashed super hard. It felt like I got an amazing nights sleep and woke up well rested but all of today I was really tired and spacey and I almost fell asleep in my business class. I got home and napped for like four hours. Was that from the weed or did I just not get as much sleep as I thought I did? 




 Or if the cop had been a state trooper and not a deputy then this guy would've been in the wrong. 
 




 I read the whole thing. He could be wrong depending on the officer or if deputies are granted state trooper privileges.

 I'm thinking of building my own bike. I want it to be really lightweight, where's a good place to look for frames and all that stuff? 




 Yeah I guess I'll probably get the kilo. A shop around here carries Fuji's. How would the declaration or feather stack up to the TT? 




 In my dorm building atm but I'll be moving out soon. My bigger concern is weekends and work because I usually lock up off campus. 




 I know that the components aren't of the highest quality but bike theft is a huge problem where I live and I'm not sure that a nicer bike would last. I'm currently riding a Retrospec B SS and loving it! It really got me into cycling and I think I want to pick up a second bike. Enter the attack. Currently I think that I'm riding 10-20 miles a week, 30-40 if I really get going. I'm trying to ride more though so I'm trying to eventually do 10 a day for exercise plus whatever I do when I'm commuting.

http://www.vilanobikes.com/vilano-attack-fixed-gear-bike-track-bike.html 














 I absolutely love the single speed bike I got about a month and a half or so ago. I've been commuting on it and riding maybe 20ish miles a week. 50 if I'm really going strong. I was considering buying a motorcycle but I think I might want to invest in a higher end road bike for commuting and fitness. Any recommendations? I'd like to spend no more than $1,000. I like the simplicity of the SS but I realize that upgrading to a geared bike might be worth it for when i start doing longer rides. 




 Look for something in the description of the bike that says "flip flop hub." That allows you to flip the back wheel and make it a SS. I got [this bike](http://www.retrospecbicycles.com/b-series-fixie.html) about a month ago from a shop in my town and I absolutely love it. It's simple and lightweight. My only complaint is that it's terrible at absorbing bumps.

 I've been trying to lose weight and I picked up a SS for college a few weeks ago and I've literally never had so much fun exercising.  




  But wait, isn't the federal government in the US currently trying to claim that encryption is something that only people with something to hide would use?

No. The circlejerk blinded people so much that they couldn't actually read past the title of that story. What he was actually saying is that since encryption can be used as a weapon, companies selling encryption software need to start making a good faith effort to confirm that the person buying the encryption software lives inside the United States.
