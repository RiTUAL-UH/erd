 I am out of shape and not buff like Ken. If i had him flattened out with both arms around his neck I would have finished him no doubt. I don't care if Ken is over the hill. There is no way he shouldn't have finished that in that position. I don't buy it. 




 what about old man strength? and the massive  of cycle of steroids Ken just did?  




 The ease with which Kimbo got up should be convincing enough if Ken's inability to finish was not.  




 worse! it was fixed 




 because ken wasn't actually trying to submit him 




 because it was 




 I think so. 




 Ken lost that on purpose! **FIX**

 Ken is the most fake person in MMA. Kimbo can't even walk, but I am rooting for him to KO Ken.  









 I honestly think Jimmy might take the job and never give it back, just like Tom did.

you're right, we do have to incentivize it, both monetarily and with shine 




 Could crossfit maybe make an impact?  




 that sounds about right 




 For the masses, yes it kind of does.  




 I think you have identified the cause of the problem.

we can't all be andrew luck fans, can we? 




 Other countries have lifters who are in the olympics at 19 or 20, and our lifters aren't lifting anywhere in the same universe as them. Why are these tiny nobody countries, no offense  I just mean in terms of population and work presence, putting elite lifters up there and we're not? Even North Korea is kicking our butts. North Korea! The country we make fun of all the time and is starving to death.

 I got to see Moon towards the end of his career. He was special. 









 We have our three major sports and hockey as a 4th major regional sport. Soccer isn't on the radar. We did just beat Germany though, so the future is bright.  




 thanks, he's been right about so much! 




 ah, thanks 




 It bothers me that the Chinese dominate. I respect their athletes, but I wish we'd value weight lifting.

 You're rihgt, there could have been many different motives, but cccam's razor = hate crime 




 how is it unethical? it was a hate crime, it is relevant  




 Because America is run by corporations and special interests like the NRA (national rifle assocation). They own about 95% of all politicians. They don't serve the interests of the citizenry. Also, our values are defunct. We have mass shootings all the time, but people value extreme gun rights more than they do people's lives. This is why it's a lot easier to purchase a gun than it is to vote. 




 right now 




 about what? like which particular bit of his are you referring to? i'm genuinely curious  




 i'm not caught up on the american lifting scene, hence my question 




 Not sarcasm. We do though if you consider all the sports.  




 u want sugar coating?  




 How is it disgusting? Isn't that exactly what happened?

 Thanks. So, we have pretty much nothing? :(

 Mayweather has already defeated Cotto, Alvarez, and Pacquiao. Amir Khan appears beneath his level. 

Why not put Golovkin in front of Mayweather and watch what he can do? Beating an undefeated, soon to be 20 knockouts in a row, and larger fighter would be the most difficult challenge of his apparent options, and if he wins, it would solidify his position as TBE. 

**Money** vs **GGG** 
























 HBO does with boxing. It gives more information to the viewer and improves the viewing experience.  The UFC added vegas odds, so why not make this change?  














 My school offered an unsubsidized loan that covers only half of my tuition. I think I have reached the 57.5k total limit. I have to find the rest of the tuition, a few thousand in nursing school fees, books, etc. I'm male. I have a previous bachelors degree in a social science. 90% of the 57.5k is from nursing school. A $10-15/hr job probably won't cut it.  I could use some realistic ideas. Nothing illegal.

 Great engines, horrible name. I get it, they are economical and they give a boost, but could Ford not come up with a more attractive name for their turbocharged engines? "Eco" sounds weak and un-American.  

















































 The Lakers 2015 first round pick of course.  Top 5 protected in 2015, top 3 protected in 2016/7, unprotected in 2018.

Would the sixers be interested in Goran Dragic and or Gerald Green?  














 Assuming Jose is still the Champ at the time. Would this date be perfect?

 They'll recycle it, I'm sure of it. And Hillary's army hasn't even got started yet.  




 what are you doing to Silva's thumb? 




 is there a comprehensive list of where Sanders will be? I'd like to go if he comes to my hometown 




 They lost their coach and many players. Their QB isn't playing up to expectations. The three teams in their division are better.  




 did someone play my mix tape?  




 a lot can happen from now and next november  




 while it's reaching to take something out of context that he wrote before most of us were even born, I'm sure it won't stop Hillary's Pac's from using it 




 If he wins Iowa and New Hampshire his chances become real. 




 He doesn't have the same mechanics bruh! It's apples and oranges.

Just look at their footwork and releases.  




 He's pure. The only thing I have heard negative about him so far is he wrote some erotica like 40 something years ago. When they try to catch him by calling him a socialist or wanting to raise taxes etc, he doubles down on it and wins. 














 For a a short QB they won't pay more than Cam Newton? you're overpaying 




 The best I can do is WR Jaron Brown and a second round pick.  




 it's not the colbert report, it's stephen colbert 




 it's not the colbert report, it's stephen colbert 














 It's a typo. They listed him at [6'7](http://search.draftexpress.com/profile/Anthony-Brown-6222/), which means they rounded up from 6'6 1/2. If he was 6'8 1/2 with shoes they would have listed him at 6'9.

 The Lakers signing somebody, be it Gasol or Aldridge or somebody else.

 I actually think he'll be an all-star in a few years.

 There's substantive issues to take with Clinton, but they focus on nonsense.  



















 Please let him be the Republican nominee!  




 What if my religion is against straight marriage? I want to impose my values on everyone! No more straight marriages!  









 You're right. She could have grown. She should embrace that angle and tell how republicans they can do the same.  




 Totally. You can't use your religion to impose your morality on other people. What if my religion is for gay marriage? Your religion can't impose its  values on laws of the land over mine.  




 Hillary used to say marriage is between a man and a woman. But now apparently she's LGBT supporter #1. 

She's an opportunist.  



















 We are unfortunately the minority.  




 Why not strip Aldo? Make it so only Conor can become the champ if he wins.  


































 Stop subjecting yourself to fox news and stop with the CAPS.

 I'd rather have him Congress than as a VP that Hillary will shove off to the side while she's taking her husband's advice.

 I'll be voting for him 100% and I'm talking to many people I know and trying to get their vote too.

 Love Makwan, but he isn't ready. He should try beating someone with a wikipedia page first.  




 Maybe he missed every ethics meeting ever?  




 If the ACA unravels million of people would stand to lose health insurance. Many of them would be in red states. I think if Republicans get their way on defeating the ACA, it will assure Democrats take the Presidency and both the House and Senate.  




 Sanders is the only moral candidate.  




 You realize the Bush administration set us on a death spiral and the Obama administration brought us back, right? Sanders would bring up the middle class. You know what people in the bottom 50% do with money? They spend it. His rebuilding infrastructure alone would do wonders for the economy. Millions of new jobs and many positive externalities.  




 Paul wants a flat tax. Neither will happen, unless congress goes pure red or pure blue. Does this take away from the fact that Sanders would be the best President possible for 99% of Americans?  









 Len is garbage. Pick 13 is likely garbage. The two other picks are likely not worth much either. Bledsoe is all we'd really be giving up. 




 Bledsoe, Len, pick 13, 2016 first round pick, 2017 Heat pick.

 It says gymnasium, not oven. 




 His brother is a politician in England :) 




 You should reconsider your views on socialism. Learn more about it. 




 What if I told you Sanders's positions are aligned with the public more than Paul's was? And even more than all the so called mainstream aka corporately owned candidates?  




 I was wondering where the photonic cannon was in the finale against the borg.

 he wrote that think like 40 years ago, he's old, he too far left, etc etc BS 
























 So you get the far superior player and a pick? Good lucking signing Aldridge and Love.  




 Other Suns fans will have different opinions, but I agree with you and I think the front office is fickle.  














 It appears he's on the block and Phoenix will take a half decent offer because they're eager to unload him. What are possible trades and what is the best Phoenix could do?  




 Because I don't have to buy food from the one grocery store you go to. I don't have to chicken with broccoli to live. I can substitute ramen and cans of tuna and live off of that. But if I need a particular procedure, what choice do I have? I think you should reconsider.

We really don't have to reinvent the wheel. We have medicare and we can use that as our base. Just look at every other developed country. There's not that much mystery. Single payer would be better.  




 These are great questions!!! Let's hope we hear them in the debates.  









 oh, this is making me remember stats 




 why? 









 The markets of supermarkets and heatlhcare are very different! If I don't buy Safeway's overpriced  produce, I'm not going to die. I have many other options to buy groceries. I can even grow some food myself. Now, what happens if I need medical care? The inelastic demand curve says I have buy the product no matter how much everyone is going to rip me off. If there was medicare for everyone the government can bring down prices drastically just like every other country does. That is the power of a single provider.  




 [God wills it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ez6wfJWVCeI), Sanders will win! 



















 this is a win for democracy and Americans  




 It never is to get progress. It can be done though. 




 which website is giving those odds? 




 it makes sense 




 exactly 














 Let's not confuse the 2% who are part of organization with those that support it. [42%](http://pnhp.org/blog/2009/04/03/how-many-doctors-support-single-payer/) support it according to one source. With the implementation of the ACA and it's success, those numbers could be even higher if a survey was conducted now. 




 This is a great ruling! It gives power to the people rather than politicians.  



















 Just when we think we're becoming more progressive and humane as  a country, we're reminded that we still execute people. We have a long way to go. 









 Great observations, it definitely would be a huge plus for business. 

[Many doctors](http://www.pnhp.org/) are for single payer FYI. 

Fuck insurance companies. 

Fuck politicians.  




 the merc s class assure me they aren't 




 That's called true love. 




 no, that's not for us, we prefer paying a lot more than you and getting less care and paying a lot more for procedure sand medications cause 'Murica  




 GGG should start talking up Floyd as much as possible like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGIIleYLpRY)

 Sanders has a 11/1 hance according to vegas. I think you're very optimistic if you think you have a 1 in 11 chance of dating her. 




 Free agents don't want to play for Sarver.

 A little bit, but not like for profit medicine.  




 He's not repealing the law. He's trying to add something better. 




 Why doesn't he sit out until they pay him? If he's only making 1.5m it seems like it's worth it. 




 Yes for the rich it's the best. For your average American it is not. 




 He **did not** fight for the public option. He gave it up faster than girl on prom night.  




 He is. Let go of conventional thinking. 



















 government actually is more efficient FYI 




 Jesus? Who's that? Never heard of him.  




 Yes, I can see it now. Can we put you out of business? No, you wouldn't like that? You'd prefer to keep charging twice as much as you need to? Ok.  




 I'm sorry. 




 you could maybe get a new job?  









 I think it could show confidence and leadership if one of the republicans declared it. Somebody has to set themselves apart. 




 republicans? lol 




 You  have to at least try even if it's going to fail at first. Obama could have set a bridge for it if he delivered the public option that he promised. 




 Wait, what? doctors can barely make a middle class living? do you know doctors? because all the doctors I have come across and know are making a ton of money

I'm totally for abolishing for profit healthcare and pharm though 




 Jewish carpenter who works for the poor and those in greatest need? Where have I heard that before? 




 Some doctors are greedy pigs. Some doctors actually know how to use medicare to make a lot of money. If everyone was insured they would get care from their PCP instead of waiting to get seriously kill and go to the ER.  




 When there is one giant insurer they set the price. They tell companies what they will pay and they make them compete. It lowers the prices significantly! We have so many other countries that prove this. It's why things costs so much more in America. 

Single payer will reduce costs.  




 If anyone is peacocking, it's Trump or maybe Jindal. Sanders is realizing his goals. 




 You know that medicare currently sets the prices, right?
 




 And the high prices due to inelastic demand is immoral.  




 Did they say it though? 




 Obviously private insurance companies would be **-**, but the money saved from their profits and administrative costs would be a **net gain** for the economy.  




 that's another monster 




 Yes, govt is the insurance company just like they are for medicare and for vets. It doesn't stop you from purchasing anything though. 




 [like this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Health_Care_Act) 









 I can count. You can't be more than 100% sure. If you say anything more it means you're lying.  




 Fisher was a role player. Curry lead his team.  




 he has mad cardio too bruh 




 but the other candidates don't

hillary doesn't 




 considering we pay double to triple what other european countries pay while providing inferior care to those european countries, I think we could use a change 




 that's not nice 




 Whenever someone says they're over 100% sure they're wrong.

 Curry. Better shooter and better teammate.  




 She won't directly answer the question to not seem like she's taking anything for granted. She'll say something about her supporters and her mission etc etc. 




 Luck you! 




 Yes we do. It shows that his momentum and support is large everywhere he goes.  




 I think they have more empathy but more in touch? That's definitely arguable. Clintons make more in one month than Bernie's net worth. 




 You're  right. For profit is immoral and inefficient.  




 You haven't heard others saying it now, have you? 




 What kind of odds are you giving me? 




 You are not as you are born. You are as you make yourself and as you live your life. Just look at Jindal. 

Same here, I'll support the Democratic nominee. I won't be excited about it though. Hillary is a corporate democrat. 




 Not quite a solid argument there bud. 














 I'll be excited when I see Bernie leading Hillary in a poll. 




 I'm sure he knows this. He's pretty busy. I think you have to be strategic where you go and in what order.  














 You're right, his supporters currently are almost exclusively white. That will change. There is no other candidate that matches up to Bernie in terms of record or policies that support minorities.

 legally though?  




 I think a lot of the west coast and other parts of the country would love to see him in person. 




 It is Hillary's to lose. And there is a lot of time to lose it. 









 I think we need to get [Lenne Hardt to introduce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-wCXgS_dYE) Bernie. Some pyrotechnics wouldn't hurt either.  




 It's still early. We'll see how things start shaping up towards the end of the year. 




 Bernie cares about the environment and he won't sacrifice it to corporate overlords because he's not a puppet like all the republicans and Clinton.  




 His plugs are even worse than Trump's elaborate comb over, but at least he's super tall. It would definitely be a different dynamic if it were a three way race, but I think being the only alternative to Hildawg is working out for Bernie. 




 You're right. He and his campaign realize this though and they're working on it. Plus, early states create momentum.  














 if only i could bet legally on sports and whatnot in my state :/ 

but I can't, not even draftkings 




 People love Bernie too. 




 I saw him 11/1 at another site.  




 You got a time machine bruh? Because if you do, he's 11-1 right now and we can become very rich! 




 McCain had lapses and said questionable things. Sanders is sharp. 




 He's running as a Democrat. If he loses the primary, he's not running as a third party candidate. 




 No he's not :) 

About the same age as John McCain when he ran. And Sanders is healthy and sharp.  




 As an Atheist, no Yoel. I'm not going to go for Jesus. This is a secular country. Keep your religion to yourself.  




 I bet they pull a Jon Jones and delete that tweet.  




 You can thank God and such, but keep the proselytizing to yourself, especially when it is bigoted and not PC. And you can be sure this will blow up beyond MMA. When that happens, you can be sure he's suspended or cut. Whatever action the UFC decides to take, Romero brought that upon his self.  




 Without being political or talking about religion, let's just the Abrahamic religions are not tolerant of homosexuality. This is what happens when proselytizing goes wrong. 




 Will he get suspended or outright cut?  




 what did he say exactly? go for jesus not gay jesus? i couldn't understand him 




 all they need are headlines and soundbites

facts don't matter to the media 
























 This is the nature of the game and sports. Some of the best players of the 90's made less in their entire careers compared to average players of the 2000s. 




 If Romney decided to come back in, would he be a big favorite? 




 Good for her! Women will vote for Hillary for the same reason Barack Obama got almost all of the black vote. She's one of them. I'm not saying it's logical, but it's how people think. 




 Does it seem like teams are overpaying players just so they can lock them up and not pay them when the new CBA takes effect? 




 because certain people were raised to be prejudiced and not like brown or black people 




 People like to vote for people who look and sound like them.  














 Not that bad? Just the wars and disastrous tax cuts that lead to a near depression economy make him horrible to me. And there is so much more too.  




 Why doesn't he tell ownership if you don't pay me now I refuse to sign with you ever again? I'm only playing to keep my stock up and sign with another team when the time comes. 




 will Aaron Rodgers be there? 




 What did you expect signing all those AARP expendables?  




 if biden announced though he'd be second :/  




 LeBron won't like this 




 I'm sure fox execs are yelling, get those damn interns to find something! read them again!  




 Bush is known for his endless wars, tax cut for the rich, and destroying the economy. Obama got a lot accomplished and has a strong resume in the history books! 









 That's kinda cool! will you be like matt damon in elysium or borg in star trek now?  









 Interim title fight over regular title fight? really?  



















 Steroids will now be allowed as long as you don't inject during the match. Half time is ok.  




 I think it's more of the banks and corporate puppeteers than Hillary per se 














 who is the main event now??? 









 This should be obvious to everyone. I don't even think he's that racist. I think he's pandering to the voters in the party. 




 she's supporting hillary now and doing her dirty work 




 We just need enough of them not to, but I know you're right. 




 Until she starts up again. Give it time. There is a lot of time between now and the primary election. She deserves criticism. She came out of nowhere to attack Sanders. Not his positions, not his policies, but the man. Why did she do this? Who is she working for? 



















 So, what about the issues? what about substance? Oh right, it's easier to just attack a source and not talk about those things like claire mccaskill. 




 oh yeah? people in western europe struggling to escape? like germans want to run away from their universal healthcare and free university education?  




 why don't you worry more about content than sources? there is no desperation, it's a hail marry to begin with  



















 Why are you making an ad hominem attack? Why don't you just address the content? Some politicians are more in touch with people than others. Reliability is a fair issue. 




 Voting record bruh. I'm good.  




 She's not that liberal. She is a corporate democrat. She is a warhawk. She has a voting record. Are you familiar with it? Her backers are banks. She voted  for the war. And they are not lies or smears. They simply asked people who they thought the mansions belonged to.  




 We can and we should. We don't because Wall Street owns all of the republicans and half of the democrats, those like Hillary Clinton, Claire McCaskill, everyone who voted for the trade deal, and the President himself.  




 You mean Hillary Clinton's campaign donors? 




 To me Hillary is no different than republicans. She's a corporately owned and a warhawk. Sometimes conservatives are right about issues and in their criticisms.  




 I think it's important to consider material based on the content rather than making an ad hominem judgment. Wall Street is paying for her campaign.  




 No, of course not, just like I would not vote for someone only based on their sex. But it raises important questions. Can she relate to me? Where did she get all that money? IMO no she can't and she got that money from her Wall Street friends who pay her millions of dollars every year for speeches and are paying for her campaign.  




 Because they concentrate their wealth at the cost of everyone else. Us "wingers", what does that mean again? Well, anyway, we believe in equality, social mobility and the [American Dream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acLW1vFO-2Q).  



















 All the revenue streams you listed will not be realized by a majority of fighters.  




 We need to catch and surpass Hillary Clinton's 990k. 




 exactly! i wish someone with skills would do some Sanders Dragon Ball Z animations  




 they obviously spent the minimum money on this project and don't care at all about the fighters

they're robbing them and insulting them 




 It's indicative of Reebok's leadership. Any competent company would have oversight and checks.

 He talks about it more in the actual 60miutes story, but I can't seem to find it. He basically said they have horrible leadership, a bunch of clowns working for them. I think UFC's kits are further evidence of that. 




 They're a horrible corporation on the decline. Listen to what the [Crossfit owner said about Reebok](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKnMQKU_-b8).  




 are we doing a betting pool? i'm going to say 12,000

 crossfit is ditching reebok once their contract is up

the owner hates reebok 




 that sounds about right 
























 This is telling of the quality of Reebok. Crossfit will leave them when their contract is up. Reebok is a garbage brand and they have some of the worst higher ups in the clothing business.  




 I wish. I can't afford that either. If only there was a free event.  




 I can buy 4 of the pride shirts or one ugly Reebok shirt? It's not really a choice. 




 it is possible they'd have to pay WWE if they used CM Punk? 




 i was trying to be funny 




 they own his likeness, i'm sure they knows they'll be using his name long after he's dead  




 ;)

 this guy [sums it up](https://twitter.com/acmalin927/status/615898673658986496), the uniforms take away individuality  




 there is a [Georges](https://twitter.com/fishisoff/status/615898902256947200/photo/1) top too 









 very lol 




 was there even one fighter who looked genuinely happy?  




 That design could have been thrown together in under an hour. I would never wear Reebok's ugly clothes.  




 this kit was disappointing  




 that smacking noise he's making with his mouth is very annoying 




 happens sometimes 




 typical UFC

the problematic start is symbolic of their fight kit and the reebok deal 




 You're right. He doesn't have to reach all of them. Just enough of them at the right times. 









 The USA is not the UK. And Labour is much further to the left than Sanders. 




 fox news will spin this and say we have to begin bombing Iran ASAP 




 they got citizens united and still get to execute people, you can't win em all bad guys!  




 If only there was protection. We need to protect American jobs. We can have a strong economy if people make livable wages, like in all of those well paying manufacturing jobs that have been shipped overseas   Americans should not have to compete with slave labor.  





























 let's see if he can it up with the new testing policy, his cycling windows might have to get larger, but jacksons is good at what they do 




 This isn't new. This is what she does. People know what she is before training with her. And her fighters never break down mentally in a fight. 




 are these kits like a big chunk of the supposed pay ufc fighters are getting? do they get some coupons or vouchers for meals at the soup kitchens too? 




 beer goggles bruh

and that voice! omg, I want to be Matt Hamill 




 as it should be, champs can't miss weight, none of this Paulo Filho BS 




 If the Dems can win the next two presidential elections there is a very good chance the court could be drastically reshaped to be progressive 6-3. 




 Say the Rebels win. What are the chances they turn on Irael in a decade or two? 




 How do NATO allies feel about this?  




 great video! 














 If the average American can what? 

Get rid of the cap on social security taxes. This does not affect the average American at all. If you expand medicare it will bring costs down. Those are the primary social costs. 

And take it easy on defense spending, corporate welfare, and tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires. And stop the banks for gouging everyone.  




 That's dishonest, so republican style for sure. 

But it wasn't socialism that ruined Greece. It was Greece that ruined Greece. A country can function only so long when people retire young, nobody pays taxes, and everyone wants services. 

Western Europe shows us what democatic socialism is.  




 **Boxing**. Heavyweight champion of the world! **Klitschko vs James**

He has great footwork, balance, height, and reach.  




 or vice versa?  




 i bet he  could practice for a few months and play on any team 




 what particularly? granted, he's very fast, but he's too big to be running sub 10second 100's or sub 20 second 200's 




 Imagine Megatron but even bigger. LeBron is crazy fast too! 

 




 there are many people whose parents lose it 




 you want the 2nd pick for a first rounder next year?  




 he's 11 to 1 so you're wrong :) 




 Barack campaigned as a progressive. He ended up governing as a center of right moderate. He didn't even try to get the public option. Somehow he's called a socialist by the right who more insane every day with the tea party. The Jewish guy who is a socialist democrat is the only honest candidate. He puts American workers first. He doesn't have corporations and the banking industry backing him like Hillary Clinton. 

I think you're making a good choice.  




 there's like a 2% chance of that happening
 




 thank you, you were right 




 He should not take VP if offered. Why would anyone want to be her VP? We all know Bill will have more power than the VP. Also, Bernie does great work in the senate.  




 Muslim? Since when? And gay? Did you see some polling somewhere that you would care to share with me? 

Personally, I'd like to see an atheist become president but i'm not holding my breath. 




 he panders to racists and is now #2 for the GOP 




 and free speech is something the government can't hinder, as far as the company you work for? oh yeah 




 It's not rehosted. Rings of fire does the program.  




 and he has decent feet! dirk 2.0 









 Kristaps Porzingis 




 The answer is not that simple. The race is dynamic and there are many factors we have to consider. I'm sure it will depend on each particular state. 




 can't reach more catholics if people are drowning and dying off 














 [no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31g0YE61PLQ) 
























 your goals are mediocrity  




 lol 




 I think they are. They're playing at a high level. 

He's old but not "old". 




 because i asked this question? 




 their two best players, guards, are in their prime 

they got an experienced center

 




 never heard it before

to us a kit is something that you have to assemble 

or the real name of Jon Snow  




 we'll see 




 In my mind Steve Nash never left.  




 So your rommate is a woman transitioning into a man?  




 he's listed as PF  









 timmy will list himself as PF no matter what

that's how he do 




 I have so many stories. If there are Lakers jerseys when I got to my seats, I always sigh.  




 why would he want to play for the spurs? they're old, he has to play center, and what kind of numbers is he going to get there? 

he should come to phoenix, light it up! we run and get buckets, none of this "defense" mess 




 The obnoxious Lakers fans at Suns games. Seriously drunk lady, stop screaming for a minute.  




 I hope Love will be able to feed his kids with only $110,000,000. After paying his agent and taxes, that might only be like $70,000,000, smh.  




 done 




 and 720 

much better! 




 oh ok, maybe they can fix it? 




 did you forget him selling picks for cash? we could have had deng and rondo 




 i don't think it works like that, i think someone recorded the event with a cell phone from 2003 




 144p? really?  




 you're  gonna be crushed when he signs with the spurs

just forget about it, if we get him then you can celebrate, but otherwise you're just setting yourself up for heartbreak  




 don't forget to put "no homo" after your response everyone

*not that there is anyone wrong with being homo, just saying* 




 any chance cheapskate Robert Sarver would be ok going a little over the cap? 




 that's wild 




 that's a lot of money to clap 




 how does the tax work? is it double each dollar your'e over the cap? or another way? 




 after James left, yes 




 i'll have to check them out, thanks 




 but see, LeBron is hurt early in the season so they have time to develop without him rather than depending on him

it would be different 




 thx 




 what? how does that even work? are the numbers listed somewhere? 




 You mean kind of like how it already is?  




 If Kyrie and Kevin stay healthy, I say they make the finals and lose.  




 so how much are the cavs going over the cap and how much luxury tax are they going to pay? 




 transracial? lol jk 

what's it like having a trans roommate? i'm thinking maybe less worse than non trans people? 




 I hear you! people give so much hate when you're relaying facts and they confuse it as normative positions  




 lol 




 i like leaders like bernie, not people catching up like hillary 




 Why not do a short deal with an option and then he can get upgraded soon enough? 




 First round pick and any player that didn't have a big money commitment.  




 does bledose get traded for him or does phoenix keep bledose? maybe we unload the morris twins trash? 




 Must be Portland Degeneration-X! 




 We have been here many times before. We get close a lot and are let down.  




 what are the chances he's traded to the one or two teams he blows off?  




 it will free him up big on offense for sure 




 solid analysis  




 dirk is the exception, not the rule 

you should have brought up robert parish 

been like he has 3 more contracts left 




 what about NY? 




 i think you're reaching just a bit lol 




 they said this? lol 




 good points 




 Thanks.  




 agenda: break the story or guess correctly so they become big 




 This is supporting your earlier prediction. 




 This is enough for me to get my hopes up so I can later be disappointed. 




 As unlikely as it may be, James leaving is still in the realm of possibility.  




 good answer, thanks

 




 He's about to turn 30 and signing probably his last contract of his career. 




 f*ck em 




 "reload this page"  




 interesting move!  




 damn 




 could he decide to sign and scrap those meetings?  




 seriously!  




 with whom? 




 are you in europe?  




 why not?  




 i almost feel bad for knicks fans, almost 




 thanks bro 




 why do you think this? because i think we're at best his 3rd choice 




 that doesn't mean he can't take his sweet time though 




 it's exhausting  




 Because I can't think much more of this.  




 my head and fingers hurt 




 yes, thanks 




 ok, thanks 




 so it could be higher?  




 That's not soon enough. 




 Lakers should keep Russell, and unload everything else of value to get as many picks as possible and then try to get Ben Simmons.  




 Until Ben Simmons comes along.  




 i'd take him over our politicians who regularly sell us out to corporations and banks 




 this is true, she's still a lot better than anyone with the bad guys

but she can very far to the left and I think she will Obama us

i only believe Sanders will put americans first instead of the banks and corporations 




 are you really? lol

because it would be funny that I asked a tax accountant this question 




 Can't he still get the high contract from Portland and get traded with that contract to Phoenix?  




 Robert Sarver trading player for cash, like with Deng or Rondo. 




 [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iTrqHvTk_0) 




 that's true 




 this is only impressive if you're 100% straight  




 and what's your tax rate?  




 he's trying to pull a kevin costner in draft day 




 why not? as long as someone doesn't have a no trade clause
 




 please based god! 




 this is wild! he'd get his rep back up if he pulled this off 




 We'd finally upgrade from just competing for the 8th seed every year.  




 Goodwin is better than booker.  




 what if they dealt him to someone else?  




 like what?
 




 I'd go for this!  




 One man one woman.  




 because it's a reality we have to acknowledge and I am not delusional in thinking what I post or don't post will change the results of the primary election  




 at committing felonies  




 Amare? But he doesn't rebound. Only jump shots.  




 The two largest markets can't get any quality free agents. NBA needs to back to the rigging business.  




 Bernie Sanders stood for gay rights before it became popular.  









 Kobe.  




 fantasy value is taking a hit with him being the 3rd option and not putting up his old numbers  




 Iowa? do you guys have early voting? I'm hoping you lead the way 




 What can we expect from Love next season? will he be a 20/10 player again?  




 so maybe 5'10 or 5'11? 




 Glad to hear you think for yourself, but you're the exception unfortunately

  




 there is? what is the hard cap? where is that info? 




 Historically, height has been a factor in presidential elections.  




 they're using a team based model on an individual based sport

also, their product is shit 




 you don't have to  like it but it's how many people vote

don't shoot the messenger  














 Get boards and pass him the ball.  









 I thought there was not a hard cap in the NBA like there is in the NFL? Is this wrong? Why don't top players like James have their teams spend well over the cap since they're selling out every night and getting them more TV money just for being with the team??? 









 She got money from regular people, but you know Wall Street is eager to have her at the helm. The banks can't give her money fast enough. It would be so sweet to see Sanders wreck the banks!  




 There's always some chance.  




 when is the **next** TV deal go into effect? or rather, when does the one about to start expire? 




 more like 1000% 









 You can't leave earlier? While it is a gamble, if I were you I would go because it could be an opportunity to be part of something historical that you could look back on. What's the worst that can happen? You waste a tank of gas and an evening?  




 there is a convergence in Wisconsin  









 that was not just MSNBC, that was everyone 




 years of gay rumors apparently  














 He couldn't see the tax cuts would hurt the economy? really?

you felt safer because he started a war with Iraq? you know the Bush administration taking out Hussein and dismantling their military led to the destabilization of the region and the formation of ISIS, right? 




 is Te'o bringing his girlfriend? 




 I want to go!  




 You're the majority. Most democrats and republicans vote this way. The race is about the people in the middle.
