 I took him to mean it in that way as well. I see more Akalis carrying than Zeds at the moment though, but that's silver elo. Where I see Akali having an easier play style than Zed (but still damn hard to master) with less fancy mechanics to mess up due to the poor mechanical play from the lower masses. 




 I don't think WE is useless at the stage in its parts WW works very well with AS and recurve bow and dagger give a lot of AS making his early clears much quicker. At least I always make those two first unless I plan on ganking mid more. 




 If can vouch for that! Had a game last night went WE first then finished FF went Tabi and SV and RO then BOTRK. Ended a 48 minute game with 10/0/20 the enemy team was ahead for a large amount of the game. Safe to say they flamed me quite hard in post game lobby. I would 100-0 their carries every TF.
(Edit for grammar) 




 A lot of people say to go WE if you are behind when you start ganking and BOTRK if you are ahead. Personally I always start WE then finish FF I usually have enough gold by the time I stack it up to have both. Two tank items depending on team comp and who's fed. Then BOTRK but alas I am a lowly silver player so I'm probably doing it all wrong! 

I do agree BOTRK is a stronger item but is a lot more expensive and by hitting the power spike of FF and WE by the 17 minute mark or so I think it helps out a lot more for the early to mid game. 

Correct me anyone if you think I'm wrong would like to know if what I'm doing is correct. 




 Ah ok. I didn't watch the vid because I'm in work just presumed it was for junglers!
 




 I will have to try this, I've lately had great success jungling with ww at silver elo and never once thought that perhaps I should invade solo. High risk high reward I suppose! Although as ww I do always pink my red before going blue at the start anyway so I never get solo countered only by 5 man groups which has happened a fair few times!  




 I main ww and I use the exact same path and always hit 6 at around the 7 minute mark. I've tried the other routes but find the one you use the most efficient due to his sustain and lack of need to clear both buffs quickly. The only time I will deviate is if I fear being invaded at either buffs.

Also another quick note if you don't already do this is to start with a pink and save your 50 remaining gold for your first back don't waste it on a hp pot at the start its really not needed on ww. 
























 *Ensure ..... I highly doubt he's going back in time to buy insurance. That's just way to convoluted for any time travel paradox.
Edit: Although it could make him rich with the payouts..... 




 His probablity logic is not off. They have a higher chance of having a smurf on their team because there is 5 people that you don't know if they are or not but only 4 on your team. So smurf chances are stacked in their favour unless as he suggested you are a smurf yourself. Of course that doesn't diminish the odds of the four on your team of course, but still higher chance on theirs. 




 I don't think mmo's which are a different type of game in all honesty but still a game with major updates, content and balancing still don't require you to be a certain pvp rank or have completed so much content to be a QA tester. So why should it be different for riot? 




 Quality assurance tester. 




 I don't think that Is the point the op is trying to get across. I completely agree hiring people based on their skill of the game is just silly, if it is true of course. That aside I have never heard of this from any game before other than their usually being a stipulation of a love for the game in question.
Edit: For spelling. 




 I'm sure that isn't supposed to be possible, in ranked at least, in normals I'm not sure. 




 I am not entirely sure because I don't use target champs only. But I would imagine Riot had intended to not use both at the same time because that would make poking through the wave incredibly easy and thus would have set attack move to override target champ only. As I said not entirely sure but it makes sense to me. 
























 Looks like dad might have lost something you're not aware of. His bandaging skills are bad ass. He's done this before clearly.... 
Edit: pressed save too early and missed something out. 




 Obvious mistake, is obvious.... 




 Yeah blame the chain for not helping its disabled employee's more tbh. Totally their fault clearly haha. But again a 60 year old deaf lady who doesn't even attempt to lip read is kinda silly. And yes I'm aware that we should make changes for them and not the other way around but its the simple things that are taught to deaf children all around the world to help them overcome these things. So yeah she did it on purpose imo. 




 Not sure on this but I think like 99% of deaf people learn to lip read pretty damn well. Sounds like she was trolling you. Unless she was looking away from you through the entire situation which you said she wasn't. To be honest a badge reading I'm deaf does not prepare you for how to deal with the situation and that persons employers should be taking more steps to avoid this kind of thing. Totally not your fault. Although a little less laughing could have been avoided perhaps..... p.s. I'm from wales too woop. 




 I think you know why you got banned. You stated your self that you had been chat restricted more than once. Perhaps you should have changed your ways? No sympathy. 




 Lol no witch hunting and you post his stream. Think that's kinda the same thing, but hey helps us see who it is! This is all over reddit at the mo as well nothing new :( exploits galore lately...  




 I wouldn't say those stats are fantastic but the winrate is suggesting to me you got lucky. 
























 That is hilarious dude. I've seen that movie twas pretty bad, but if she's who I think she is she wasn't so bad. Glad you got away with it all. What did they expect from you!  




 Yes this. Without a doubt with the new online harassment laws in place you can certainly tear her a new one with very little effort. 




 If you didn't know who Nicole Aniston was why did you say it? I smell a vintage porn perv! 




 After re-reading I see you didn't drink it till you got there. Fair enough then :) still an alcoholic though! 




 Tl;dr socially inept alcoholic drinks and drives, and doesn't kill anyone ..... kudos. 




 Lol clearly. But at least you retorted with a comprehensible answer excluding you from being an idiot at least :D 




 Ah makes perfect sense then cause that shit was nigh on perfect! 
























 This is a standard during lots of matchups for wukong. Pretty much anyone with high poke or sustain and you're not too clued up on the matchup you Should start flask and pots. 




 I don't see why this post is dumb at all! A lot of people do make this mistake though and every time I dread to think what it would be like I their shoes.... 




 Probably best to distance yourself for her own good imo. But no harm in being friends with her if you think you can. 




 Definitely not a good idea dude..... feel for you bro. 




 Reminds me of the time when I was a child and called my friend a dildo I was about 7 at the time. I said it because it reminded me of armadillo. Till my step dad heard me and told me to go ask my mother what a dildo was ...... 




 Seriously? That tax system is insane. And here we are in the UK with our 10,000 tax free allowance and we still complain..... 




 Hos before bros dude. Tap it and forget it.
