 Some "normal" protagonists have negative qualities that make them more foolish than "normal". Which protagonists do you think are "perfectly normal"? 




 [Ri Akitoshi](http://myanimelist.net/character/68553/Akitoshi_Ri) in Area no Kishi is Korean. (Ri is the Japanese pronunciation of Lee.)

Kim Daesun, who appeared as an opposing player for Tsujido Academy, is also Korean. His name less Japanized than Ri's, although both live in Japan. 




 Have you disliked an adaptation for diverging from the original? Have you ever thought that a significant change from the original made an adaptation better?

 Do you tend to like anime based on likable characters? A good message about life? Great animation quality? Enjoyability? Or something else?

 Jeju replaced its provincial flag in 2009. See how it was ruined.

 Just so I'm clear, I'm not asking for the most painful way to kill off your least favorite character. I'm asking what are good ways for a character to exit a show permanently.

Tag spoilers, of course. 









 I'm thinking of picking up Banks' Culture series. Do you recommend it as a must-read, or as an OK series, or not at all? 




 What books made you happy or euphoric (not amused or laughing) to have read them?

Some books that I liked are:

* The Stranger, by Camus
* The Unbearable Lightness of Being, by Kundera

I'm not looking for any horror, tragedy, or romance books, though.

 There are some long-running manga that either:

* Drags the main story to run as long as possible
* Starts new arcs that are not related to the beginning of the manga

What are manga that:

* Has a clear beginning, middle, and end
* The end is concludes the story from the beginning
* Doesn't drag 




 For anime that have a remake or a second adaptation, do you watch the original/first adaptation or the remake/second adaptation?

For example:

* Space Battleship Yamato
* Sailor Moon 




 And why do you keep watching it? 




 To be a good cross-genre novel, does it need to portray each genre well separately, or does it result in a wholly different genre than the parent genres? 




 And if so, what is the best example that you know of?

 Compared to other artists or groups. 




 The antagonist should be an individual, not a group or a concept. 




 For those who write fiction, how do you choose names for your characters? Names of people you know? Names with relevant meanings? Or names that you think sound good? 




 What novels have you read which made you least likely to think some passages could be cut without impacting the story? 




 Not necessarily *blind* optimism, but opposite of cynical.
