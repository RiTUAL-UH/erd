 Still, I can't help wondering if the puritanism found in some places in the Pali Canon is an historical artifact, resulting from a general disparagement of the physical body that seems to have become common in India and elsewhere[...] such attitudes were apparently part of the cultural milleu the Buddha was raised in. Or did they arise afterward, and were inserted into the Canon later?

Whether or not such metaphysical considerations were a factor, other, more basic issues must have been important. Some of them are obvious and have already been mentioned. Monastic sexual activity would be a distraction to say the least, and expend a lot of energy that would be better used in other ways. Think of how much time and effort sexual affairs and liaisons can involve, even when they are not secretive. Add to that all the tensions and jealousies that would be created within the Sangha.

Already it becomes apparent that having a more relaxed attitude toward sex would be fatal to the spiritual focus of the community. However, at least two other concerns must also have weighed heavily.

We tend to forget that until the 1960s there was really no reliable contraception. Since Buddhism prohibited abortion and infanticide, sex meant babies, and all the work of caring for them and raising themespecially the unremitting daily task of providing enough food, which is incompatible with a mendicant life. The consequences of this can be seen in the cautionary tale of Japanese Buddhism. Japanese culture has always viewed our natural urges as...well, natural. That very much includes the sexual urge, and many if not most temple monks had common-law wives and children before they were legally permitted to marry after the Meji Restoration. The task of providing for them eventually transformed the temple into a family business, with the oldest son expected to become a priest to keep that temple business in the family, regardless of whether he had any religious inclinations. As a result, Japanese Buddhism today is a thriving (and lucrative) industry focusing on funerals and memorial services, and not much else.

One more factor may have been the most important of all. Buddhist monastics are traditionally dependent on lay support. This means that the Sangha must be very sensitive to the expectations of their supporters. For example, Chinese monks and nuns became vegetarian not because their vows required it but because the laity began to expect it. Also, needless to say, it wouldn't do to have monks seducing their supporters' daughters (or sons). Moreover, laymen and women would not look kindly upon sharing their hard-earned food and other resources with renunciants who, instead of devoting themselves to their spiritual practice, spend time dallying with lovers.  Even today, when monks in southeast Asian countries like Thailand are discovered with girlfriends, it's sometimes the local lay community that takes the initiative in forcibly disrobing them.

To sum up, there are many strong reasons for the Buddhist Sangha to be strictly celibate. Which of these were the important factors? Early Buddhist texts do not help us decide among them, but my guess is that all of them were.

How does this shed light upon our situation today? If it is more or less inclusive, there are major implications for Western Buddhism, because few if any of those reasons for celibacy are valid for lay practitioners today.

Yes, there are still times (periods of intensive practice) and places (within practice communities) when sexual abstention is obviously wise to observe. Few Western Buddhists, however, still look upon nature, women, and sex as impure entanglements to be avoided. Most of us don't have to worry about what our lay supporters think, because we don't have any, at least not in the traditional sense. Today we have access to effective means of birth-control, so babies usually aren't an issue unless and until we want them to be. A new category of Buddhist has become common in the West: less than monastic in lifestyle (hence not subject to Sangha vows or regulations) but also more devoted to practice than laity have usually been.[...]

So...does that mean we can breathe more easily now, as we accept and enjoy the new sexual freedoms? Not quite yet. There is another aspect of sexual relationships that we need to be aware of, and it's one that is not usually acknowledged.[...]

Our own cultural perspective should not be taken for granted, as if it provided some universal standard. Present Western attitudes are historically conditioned too, in this case by a myth about romantic love that evolved in late medieval Europe[...]

Although some of the emphasis has shifted from finding the right spouse to finding the right sexual partner, there is still the same expectation of personal fulfillment whether through romance or sexual intimacy. Buddhism questions that conscious or unconscious expectation, just as it challenges other myths that predispose us to seek happinessthe end of *dukkha*in an unskillful way.

Sexual intimacy is a source of pleasure and gratification, and a very nice one it can be; it can also help create and sustain deeper, more meaningful relationships. Nevertheless, the sex drive is basically biological. Sex is an appetite. We do not use our sexual organs; they use us. That is why there is ultimately something delusive about the myths of romantic love and sexual fulfillment. Sex is nature's way, and marriage is society's way, to reproduce the species. Genuine happinessthat is, the end of *dukkha* for any of the parties involved has little if anything to do with it.

 **The Method of Discourse**


We often find references to four stages in which the Buddha would initiate and conclude a discourse. The first stage is represented as "pointing out" (*sandasseti*), that is, indicating the problem. If it was in reference to an individual, the Buddha would explain that person's situation. If it concerned an event, thing, or phenomenon, the Buddha would attempt to create some "agitation" (*samuttejeti*) by emphasizing the non-substantiality of the individual, event, thing, or phenomenon. This is the process of deconstruction, intended to avoid any ontological commitment. If the discourse is concluded at this point, the person to whom it is addressed will be left in a state of anxiety. During the third stage, the agitation is immediately appeased (*sampahaseti*) by pointing to a way out of the problem. This is the process of reconstruction or redefinition, which is achieved through the positive doctrine of dependent arising explaining the subject, the object, and morality and freedom. In doing so, the Buddha recognized the capacity of language to communicate the content of human experience, whether that relates to facts or values. In the final stage, the Buddha makes no effort to convert the hearer to his way of thinking, for the hearer tends to accept his explanation without much ado (*samadpesi*).

The discourse (*dhamma*) formulated in terms of language thus becomes the means of communication. Communication, not only among those who speak different languages but also among those who speak the same language, becomes impossible if one adopts either of the approaches toward language criticized by the Buddha, namely, strict adherence or transgression. The first would imply that each conception utilized in language has its incorruptible object (ontological commitment) unavailable to human experience, while the second would imply that human experience is incommunicable through language (that is, linguistic transcendence). The Buddha seems to have realized that the former is more perverse that the latter. His method of communication therefore deals first with the problem of ontological commitment and then with linguistic transcendence. 


This is an extremely significant method of communication and conversion, based on the Buddha's understanding of human psychology. His contemporaries, who failed to understand the psychological significance of this method of discourse, saw him as a person possessed of the magical power of conversion (*vaan my*). Yet there was no magic or mystery involved. All that the Buddha did was carefully observe the intellectual maturity and psychological state of each person and provide a discourse that would produce beneficial consequences for him. The Chinese version of the Agama passage that refers to the four stages rightly characterizes them as the Buddha's "skill in means".

"Skill in means" does not imply converting someone by discoursing on something that is obviously false. In fact, the two stages of causing agitation (*samuttejana*) and appeasement (*sampahasana*) correspond, respectively, to deconstruction of solidified conceptions through analysis (*vibhga*), which is the function of the doctrine of non-substantiality (*anatta*), and reconstruction of the same conception by the method of explanation (*vykaraa*), which is achieved through the principle of dependence (*paticcasmuppda*). Both these processes allow for a great degree of flexibility and are intended to eliminate both absolutism and nihilism.

'A History of Buddhist Philosophy - Continuities and Discontinuities' by David J. Kalupahana, (University of Hawaii Press; 1992) pp.65-67. 









 The preparation for the bodhisattva path is the unification of body and mind: the body works for the mind and the mind works for the body. The hinayana shamaha and vipashyna practices make the mind precise, tanquil and smooth in the positive sense - precisely being there, rather than dreaming or sleeping or hazily perceiving. We can make a cup of tea properly, because the body and mind are synchronized.

Then we are ready to leap on to the bodhisattva path, to open to the joy of working with sentient beings, including oneself. The bodhisattva makes friends with himself as well as with others. There are no mysterious, dark corners left of which to be suspicious; no surprises can occur to destroy the bodhisattva's spiritual intelligence, his dignity and heroism. This is the first step, the first *bhumi* or spiritual level.

The word 'bhumi' in Sanskrit, or the word *sa* in Tibetan, means 'earth' or 'level' or 'ground', the ground where you can relate with yourself and others. There is no mystification, no confusion; it is obviously solid earth. In other words, it is the equivalent of the basic sanity, fundamentally being *there*. Since the bodhisattva knows his body and his mind and how to relate with the two, the whole process becomes 'skillful means' because of such transcendental security. Which is more like being *in* security rather than being secured, rather than watching yourself to make sure everything is okay. That fundamental security comes from realizing that you have broken through something. You reflect back and realize that you used to be extraordinarily paranoid and neurotic, watching each step you made, thinking you might lose your sanity, that situations were always threatening in some way. Now you are free of all those fears and preconceptions. You discover that you have something to give rather than having to demand from others, having to grasp all the time. For the first time, you are a rich person, you contain basic sanity. You have something to offer, you are able to work with your fellow sentient beings, you do not have to reassure yourself anymore. Reassurance implies a mentality of povertyyou are checking yourself, 'Do I have it? How could I do it?' But the bodhisattva's delight in his richness is based upon experience rather than theory or wishful thinking. It is *so*, directly, fundamentally. He is fundamentally right and so can delight in generosity.

 Furthermore, if we cling to our being Christians, Jews, atheists or Buddhists, we 
will always be worried about what people may think of Jesus and the Christians, of Jews, 
of atheists, or of Buddha and the Buddhistsand when those with whom we identify are 
insulted, we will get offended and suffer, and we might even be willing to fight and thus 
run the risk of suffering blows, pain, bruises, wounds and even death (or to cause any of 
these damages to our opponent). However, if we defeat our adversary we will remain 
dissatisfied as well, since we will never be able to convince him that we are right, and he 
will keep on having a negative opinion of Christians, Jews, atheists or Buddhists. This 
dynamic is at the root of conflicts between groups, and in particular of warswhich, 
given the characteristics and number of present weapons, in the best of cases produce a 
drastic acceleration of the process of self destruction of humanity and, in the worst of 
cases, might cause the immediate destruction of life on our planet. Thus Krishnamurti 
was right when he asserted that, so long as we are this or that (which, as will be shown in 
the next chapter, in the context of this book means so long as we delusorily value our 
being this or that), we are responsible for wars and for confrontations between groups, 
with all their negative consequenceswhich nowadays may even involve global 
destruction.

      Memory is a prism through which 

     yesterdays's light is passed;

     Split into a rainbow of moments 

     each colored more dimly than the last. 

     How will today's light look tomorrow

     Would the filter of time be as brutal

     if that prism were two-way?

 I asked this question a while back in /r/AskLiteraryStudies - [link](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskLiteraryStudies/comments/1l83m6/portrayals_of_healthy_sexual_relationships/) . Can anyone think of examples in literature in which a long-term sexual-relationship is depicted as happy, healthy and non-neurotic? 





































































 I've realised that I've been practising the karuna-bhavana instead of the metta-bhavana. At the Triratna centre that I go to they teach the metta-bhavana to beginners. Whenever I do it I find myself trying to 'put myself in the shoes of' whoever it is I'm visualising. For, how can one love someone when one does not make an attempt to comprehend their situation? This entails compassion - i.e. karuna. 

Today, while going through the stages of the metta-bhavana I felt truly powerful paroxysms of pity. It was difficult to breathe and stay seated upright. It took a great deal of effort to regain composure.

I understand now why the karuna-bhavana is reserved for more advanced practitioners. What I would like to know is if anyone has any tips on how I can practise the metta-bhavana without having this problem again? How can one try to demarcate the metta-bhavana from the karuna-bhavana? 




 I was racking my mind to think if I'd read any novels (and plays/poems) that portray a positive, lasting sexual relationship.

Just as I was writing this, I remembered the relationship between the protagonist of McEwan's 'Saturday' and his wife. Apart from that, I found examples a bit thin on the ground.

Can anyone provide me with examples in literature in which a long-term sexual-relationship is depicted as happy and healthy and non-neurotic? 














     I've been high and I've been low. 
    And I know which I'd rather be. 

    At the top of the atmosphere it starts to get lighter - 
    All the colours, whiter and whiter.

    Around us all, beyond the air, 
    The whirling, crushing cosmos bear,
    Lonely. Unfair.

    The cosmos absorbs us all so small.
    Still love. Still pity.

Moral of the story: Cherish wise attention. Value a-voidance.
 




 I've been high and I've been low. And I know which I'd rather be. As you get to the top of the livable atmosphere it starts becoming lighter - more enlightened. Beyond - the vasty dark cosmos. Wise attention. Value a-voidance. 




 Does anyone have a memory from before you learnt how to speak?  


































 Meditation is about stilling the mind so we can see clearly. Meditation is about getting into the actual life and experience of our consciousness. Meditation reveals how wonderful life could be. How free we could be. Meditation, and a simple ethical life, reveals the deep habits that have been a vital condition for evolutionary success: the single-minded urge for supremacy over other members of our own species; the survival of the fittest; of the quickest; of the strongest; of the randiest; the survival of the most cunning and selfish; of the best at supporting and promoting of oneself and one's kin; and, of course, the selfish exploitation of other species.

Probably all currently surviving species have been a condition in the extinction of all other competing or edible species. We are the first species to attempt to enforce fishing quotas and to limit our urges to hunt. Meditation and an ethical life increasingly reveals another possibility - a life beyond self-clinging beyond self-promotion - a life of empathy. Shantideva says, 'When fear and suffering are disliked by me and others equally, what is so special about me that I protect me and not the other.'

All of us need to respond to the suffering in the world. Are we going to respond more like an animal or more like a Buddha?

 I had a house party the other day and have several opened but unfinished cans of lager that have gone flat. It seems wasteful to pour them down the drain. Does anyone have any suggestions as to what I should do with the lager? 




 I believe that the following passages prove that the figure of Jesus should be considered, using the language of today, **a blood-thirsty terrorist**:

* "But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them  bring them here and kill them in front of me. (Luke 19:27 NIV)

* "He that is not with me is against me..." (Matthew 12:30 KJV)

* "Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword." (Matthew 10:34 NIV)

I believe that were he simply an advocate of peace and 'turning the other cheek' it would be unlikely that the Romans would have scourged and crucified him. It is my view that he was most likely a perpetrator and advocate of violence, and that his subsequent portrayal as a pacifist is the result of historical revisionism. 





































































 I believe that belief in the divinity of Mohammed, and therefore the inviolability of the Qu'ran, is a central part of being a Muslim. In accordance with the fact that the Qu'ran instructs Muslims to ''wage war against the unbelievers'', ''cast terror into the unbelievers' hearts'', and ''forsake this world for the next'', becoming a terrorist is the logical outcome of being a Muslim. CMV.

EDIT: I have changed my view somewhat (see below). Thank you to everyone who contributed to the discussion.

 I was watching a moth pottering around. Do they live lives of constant fear? Or can they experience joy and happiness? Was wondering if it would be humane to squash it or not.

 Human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell commented on the passing of Baroness Thatcher, saying she was extraordinary for mostly the wrong reasons, but going on to say: I dont rejoice in her death. I commiserate, as I do with the death of any person.

He continued: In 1988, the Thatcher government legislated Britains first new anti-gay law in 100 years: Section 28. At the 1987 Conservative party conference she mocked people who defended the right to be gay, insinuating that there was no such right.

During her rule, arrests and convictions for consenting same-sex behaviour rocketed, as did queer bashing violence and murder. Gay men were widely demonised and scapegoated for the AIDS pandemic and Thatcher did nothing to challenge this vilification.

 That the thought of men being made to play Doom^TM and then being given a gun (or an Xbox controller) and being asked to kill **human beings** doesn't trouble you. 

 









 I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and presume you're a troll.
 




 What he thinks... means nothing

To criticise with compassion is more skillful than to criticise with hatred. Hatred blinds. Someone doesn't need to be a degree-laden 'psychiatrist' to have meaningful things to say. George Lucas has created beautiful films (American Graffiti), and has self-consciously exploited the study of personality archetypes as successfully as anyone else (Star Wars). But more important than that - he is an elder of our tribe. Something tells me you had forgotten that. Correct me if I'm wrong.

All bodies pass through the universal substance, as it were into and out of a rushing stream; cohering and cooperating with the whole, as do our physical members with one another. How many a Chrysippus, a Socrates, an Epictetus has been engulfed by time! Remember this where you have to do with any man or thing whatsoever. 




 Has anyone else reported Foldit or Eyewire causing the 'blue screen of death'? Or is it just coincidence? 




 That website has a .mil ending. 

Doom^TM is ugliness layered upon ugliness. The words 'modern military' conjure up images of Americans killing Pakistani families with Xbox controllers. And yes that is going on. 




 Linking it there shouldn't discount my arguments (which you can respond to if being logical should take your fancy. lol!). If I had submitted it to /r/getUndisciplined however...  




 So that's what they mean when they say 'butthurt'... 




 You can subscribe to religious ethics without realising you are subscribing to religious ethics.

 **Protestant work ethic** *n.* the view that to be successful through hard work is a person's duty and responsibility, which, according to Max Weber's analysis, first evolved in Protestant Europe through the teachings of Calvin. 




 Another reason it is called that is that the video game industry obeys that holiest of capitalist maxims - thou shalt not kill the cash cow. (Sometimes Moses reminds me of myself...) 




 Thought so; you were just blustering.  




 You should look at /u/rawkuts's example. I hope she is able to change some of your views too. 




 Very good. 




 How much of it do I have to play before I 'help science'? 




 * I know I'm not the only one who thinks it's a ridiculous name so you're wrong there.

* Why is it called that? and Does it involve killing?

* Just because someone is a good artist doesn't make them a good person. I'd rather have Eminem as an associate than a son-in-law. And by 'old school games' I take it you're not referring to chess? 




 Wrong, wrong, wrong.

I was trying to discourage those, (perhaps you fall into this category, perhaps not), who stumble blindly in the hell-realm that is addiction to video-games. I know a man who is in his thirties and plays video games. People mock him behind his back about it, and he has admitted to me that he feels 'shame' (his word) about his habit. True story. I, out of compassion, would like to save others from his fate.

And, **I was trying to encourage** the rays of hope out there, (One must never abandon hope. It was not without reason some Catholic theologians called despair 'the one unforgivable sin'), the comparatively enlightened video game apologist (like rawkuts) into singing in this chillest of chill lands. 

I don't know what you are or aren't envious of. I can assure you however that the video game prison looks less attractive from the outside than from within.

Perhaps drugs can help one ['to strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield'](http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/174659), perhaps they can't. One thing for sure is that they make for a better [Lotos](http://www.bartleby.com/42/638.html) than does video games. 

Edit: added brackets for clarity 




 Is there greater wisdom than: 'Forgive them, Father. They know not what they do'? If there is, is that what you were employing with your snide dismissal of Lucas in your second paragraph? You might think I'm being facetious but this exchange, I believe, highlights precisely the foibles that civilised fellow-produce-of-the-Big-Bang and enlightened 'fellow passengers to the grave' shouldn't have. 




 What on earth do you know about Buddhist teachings on ego and pride?

 It wasn't merely smug condescension. When I was a philosophy undergraduate at university they said the SEP was often more advanced than our purposes required. Equating an unknown Reddit user with an undergraduate philosophy student is not condescension (unless, perhaps it occurs in a sub such as /r/Academia). 




 Best comment yet. Still looking at your first link. The first comment to make me think of delta-ing someone. (Such a shame that it looks like a dunce's cap, though. Why couldn't they have picked any other letter?) 




 a) The science seems to state that video games do have a negative effect - http://www.psychology.iastate.edu/faculty/caa/abstracts/2010-2014/10ASISBSRS.pdf. Read that and see if you then disagree. 

b) Other things being bad does not mean that video games are good.

c) I think you missed some of the subtlety of my original explicatory comment. I said that any good engendered by games is nullified by the pallid tone in which they cast 'reality'. Perhaps you'd like to tell me more about Spec Ops. My prejudices are telling me that, going on the first two words alone, the game is not one made by a devotee of Francis of Assisi or the Lord Buddha! Please disabuse me.  




 The suggestion that an American soldier could possibly not be morally corrupted I consider risible. (If that's 'rude or hostile to other users', then sobeit. I'd find it rude and hostile to humanity for me not to say it.) 




 Everything is conditioning. I parse from your comment then that you subscribe to the 'Protestant work ethic'. I'd say that someone or something 'corrupted' you into thinking that. Additionally if I found other assumptions of yours that I believe don't cohere with reality I believe I would attribute them to either corruption or ignorance. 




 An overly jaundiced take on proceedings. 




 Sorry I had overlooked that. Some things strike different people as needing to be justified.

Here's one: [Violent Video Game Effects on Aggression, Empathy, and Prosocial
Behavior in Eastern and Western Countries: A Meta-Analytic Review.](http://www.psychology.iastate.edu/faculty/caa/abstracts/2010-2014/10ASISBSRS.pdf) 




 You truly don't see this?

Yes. It might help you to understand where I'm coming from if I told you that I'm beyond Good and Evil inasmuch as I think instead in regards to that which is *kusala* and *akusala* or 'skillful' and 'unskillful'. The idea that some people know more and are wiser than others is non-negotiable and incontrovertible to my mind.

Relevant: 

"Abandon what is unskillful, monks. It is possible to abandon what is unskillful. If it were not possible to abandon what is unskillful, I would not say to you, 'Abandon what is unskillful.' But because it is possible to abandon what is unskillful, I say to you, 'Abandon what is unskillful.' If this abandoning of what is unskillful were conducive to harm and pain, I would not say to you, 'Abandon what is unskillful.' But because this abandoning of what is unskillful is conducive to benefit and pleasure, I say to you, 'Abandon what is unskillful.'

"Develop what is skillful, monks. It is possible to develop what is skillful. If it were not possible to develop what is skillful, I would not say to you, 'Develop what is skillful.' But because it is possible to develop what is skillful, I say to you, 'Develop what is skillful.' If this development of what is skillful were conducive to harm and pain, I would not say to you, 'Develop what is skillful.' But because this development of what is skillful is conducive to benefit and pleasure, I say to you, 'Develop what is skillful.'"

 * I think my point was that video games become **more powerful** by virtue of their being **less open to interpretation**. I've not played Final Fantasy 10 (DAE think that is a ridiculous name. Like, 'Last of the Mohicans 2: Back with a vengeance!'). Is there a conscientious objector option or does one have to contort oneself into 'killer mode'?

* It wasn't an arbitrary statement/belief, sadly. I'm trying to help people. The lives that I will 'save' and the potential I will emancipate is worth my time. Of course it would be better if nothing had to be 'put down', that better world does not exist. Here in this world is suffering and dissipation. There are those things that lead to suffering and dissipation. And there are those who encourage, and those who discourage, those things that lead to suffering and dissipation. Often the opposite of dissipation leads to suffering. As often, and arguably more dangerous, is when the opposite of suffering leads to dissipation which then leads to increased suffering.

* Eminem has talent. I wonder what his 'Elegy for a Gamer' would sound like. Full of withering criticisms, no doubt! 




 *  I can't imagine anyone who wakes up in the morning and vows to devote themselves that day to the common good of all sentient beings

 There are people who do that. There are people who make the vow to do such a thing in a public ceremony. It is not uncommon in parts of the world.

* You are a 'moral relativist'. I am not. I am an 'enlightenment humanist' and, from the sounds of it, you are not. Our views of the world are incompatible.

* Hamlet may have said that but it is obvious he didn't believe it. 




 Was it the 'poverty of imagination' one?

May I ask that you not remove the comments of anyone who insults me. The insulting doesn't bother me, but the removal of potentially cogent content does. 




 I have played them and consider the time I spent on them time wasted. I do have acquaintances who play video games. I have noticed it having a detrimental effect on their 'lives'. A coldness, flabbiness, bareness characterised by grim companions and ethical indifference. 




 Poems can teach wisdom and represent beauty. Video games are more like sport without exercise. 

'When you pick up the controller something switches off in the heart.' 




 The 'I'd wager' prefix flags the conjectural basis of my comment. A conjecture not without reason however. I know, and have sources to prove, that commercial video games have been used to train killers in the past ([Marines being made to 'play' 'DOOM'](http://imgur.com/a/iImUQ#8WNhipK)), I can't think of any that have been made to instil caring into nurses or competence and compassion into doctors and surgeons. 




 Note my 'otherwise healthy' bit. 




 'Violence' and 'rampant capitalism' are 'life-skills'. I just don't think they're particularly noble ones.

 If it makes someone happy, how is that a bad thing?

You don't believe that such a thing as corruption exists?

 Reddit has a real-world application (research and propagandising, for example) which makes it disanalagous with video games. 




 What's your point? 




 How is what you choose to spend your time on morally superior to what a person who plays video games chooses?

Because I try to engage with things that are helpful, salubrious, or improving (- 'That makes better; spec. that improves the mind, understanding, or character; that makes agricultural improvements.) I believe that she who plays video games does not do so for reasons as noble as my motivators. 




 http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/action/#NatActAge

http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/personal-autonomy/

Are these helpful or would you rather something more basic? 









 I can't imagine anyone who wakes up in the morning and vows to devote themselves that day to the common good of all sentient beings would decide to spend the day playing board games in front of the television. 

Nonetheless, I will say a few words in their favour. Board games at least (usually?) require human contact so they have that going for them. 

With television, the consumption of the content can obtain with the agent's agency comparably intact. I am presented something, and then   I am beholden to no-one (not event the writer or director or leading lady) as to what opinions, and conclusions I have. I can 'make of it' what I like. With a video game I have to acquiesce with its creator to consume the content. Whatsoever she considers a door, I have to see as a door. Whatsoever she considers a task, I must consider a task. Whatsoever she considers the goal, I must assume as the goal. Whilst, one cannot 'fail' at 'The Godfather' (1972: Paramount Pictures) through being aghast at the characters' misdeeds, one could never possibly win at 'The Godfather: The Game' (2010: EA Games) without having to replicate (via your *avatar*) acts 'fearsome' and cruel.

An insect is capable of making the sort of decisions involved in Tetris. A human life wasted on such things is a sad thing however. If I was feeling poetic I'd say (after [Blake](http://www.poetryloverspage.com/poets/blake/to_see_world.html), of course)

      A Tetris brick that falls right down

      Touches the heartstrings without a sound. 




 * I am trying to say "it's so immoral you cannot justify using it". 

* Life has bigger, bolder, more pressing, and more puzzling puzzles than any video game. Ergo, those bigger, bolder, more pressing, and more puzzling puzzles will provide better braining training. 




 * The first article you quoted was awful. 

 So the fact that video game players are better at
'using a joystick and looking one way while reaching in a different direction' shows they are better at 'laparoscopic surgery'? I'm glad that no one actually believes that playing video games makes one a qualified surgeon. I'd wager that the surgeons who play video games would be worse surgeons than those that don't because they would take life less seriously and value human life less.

* 'Brain flexibility'? What kind of newspeak is this? I'd rather have a strong intellect, or a keen perception than a flexible brain. Quisling had a flexible brain. If I was a military general, I'd like recruits with 'flexible brains'. All the better to turn them from men to animals.

 And, surprise, surprise! Look who funded the study:

This research was supported by Air Force Office of Scientific Research (www.afosr.af.mil) grant FA9550-10-1-0268, Army Research Laboratory (www.arl.army.mil) grant

* I think the acid test to that would be if on your deathbed you wished you had played more video games. If you're telling me you believe you would, you have either my disbelief or my contempt and pity. 




 I think I also anticipated some of your thrust with my 'otherwise healthy' caveat in my explicatory comment above. 




 To state that one has the choice between 'seeking entertainment' and 'silently contemplating the mysteries of the universe' is a false dilemma and shows, if I might be so bold, a poverty of imagination.

Do I believe that with this precious human life, with so many different things to do, finding ways simply to 'pass the time' is a waste of time? Yes I do. The time will pass whatever we do. It is our responsibility to use it well. 




 * I have played, seen, and can name a video game.

* I am talking about the universe in which this 'morality system' takes place. If one were to 'save a tribe of villagers from a volcano' on a video game one would, on one level of consciousness, associate saving tribes of villagers from a volcano with what you did whilst playing that game. The necessary meaninglessness of the video game world (i.e. its video game-ness) has a toxic influence on a 'morality system' that has to exist in the world outside the game console, television and gamer ecology. The difference between saving a tribe of villagers and not saving a tribe of villagers on a video game has no effect on the number of lives lost (except perhaps that of the 'gamer', but that's an argument for elsewhere). The difference between saving a tribe of villagers and not saving a tribe of villagers - in real life - does have an effect that can be equated in terms of suffering caused and human lives lost. The 'morality system' cannot be equivalent or comparable between the two 'worlds'.

* 'Brutality beyond the minimum' is a phrase that has been forged by video games, I'm sure. I'll leave you to work out the irony. Correct me if I'm wrong.

* I don't think 'concomitantly' is a particularly difficult word. Let me know if you still don't understand what it means.

* It was George Lucas. His comments can be read here: http://www.theverge.com/2013/6/13/4427444/lucas-spielberg-storytelling-in-games-its-not-going-to-be-shakespeare-usc  




 In your examples the simulators are being used qua medicine/therapy not qua games. My argument is that in cases where they are 'merely games' they have no utility. 




 *All* video games. 




 In and of itself, no.

 **The Ladder of St. Augustine**

BY HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW

* * *
     
     
     Saint Augustine! well hast thou said,
     
      That of our vices we can frame

     A ladder, if we will but tread
     
      Beneath our feet each deed of shame!


     All common things, each day's events,
     
      That with the hour begin and end,

     Our pleasures and our discontents,
     
      Are rounds by which we may ascend.


     The low desire, the base design,
     
      That makes another's virtues less;

     The revel of the ruddy wine,
     
      And all occasions of excess;


     The longing for ignoble things;
     
      The strife for triumph more than truth;

     The hardening of the heart, that brings
     
      Irreverence for the dreams of youth;


     All thoughts of ill; all evil deeds,
     
      That have their root in thoughts of ill;

     Whatever hinders or impedes
     
      The action of the nobler will; 

     

     All these must first be trampled down
     
      Beneath our feet, if we would gain

     In the bright fields of fair renown
     
      The right of eminent domain.

     

     We have not wings, we cannot soar;
     
      But we have feet to scale and climb

     By slow degrees, by more and more,
     
      The cloudy summits of our time.

     

     The mighty pyramids of stone
     
      That wedge-like cleave the desert airs,

     When nearer seen, and better known,
     
      Are but gigantic flights of stairs.

     

     The distant mountains, that uprear
     
      Their solid bastions to the skies,

     Are crossed by pathways, that appear
     
      As we to higher levels rise.

     

     The heights by great men reached and kept
     
      Were not attained by sudden flight,

     But they, while their companions slept,
     
      Were toiling upward in the night.

     

     Standing on what too long we bore
     
      With shoulders bent and downcast eyes,

     We may discern  unseen before 
     
      A path to higher destinies,

     

     Nor doom the irrevocable Past
     
      As wholly wasted, wholly vain,

     If, rising on its wrecks, at last
     
      To something nobler we attain. 



















 **A GURU - WOULD I TRUST ONE? (Analytical Meditation)**

- Did I educate myself, who taught me the things I know? 


- Could I have learned to talk, read, write without relying on a teacher? 


- Could a sceptical 6-year old ever learn to read, without having a positive and open attitude? 


- Is it possible that other people know more than me? 


- Do trustworthy people exist at all? 


- What qualities would I expect of a real spiritual teacher? 


- Would I recognise a real spiritual teacher when I met one? 


- Would I like to have a spiritual teacher to make good progress or just to get rid of the responsibilities for my own life?

**Dumur**: How was the new edition of Nietzsche's Complete Philosophical Works established?

**Deleuze**: The problem was to reclassify the posthumous notesthe Nachlassin accordance with the dates Nietzsche had written them, and to place them after the works with which they were contemporaneous. Some of them had been used in an abusive way after Nietzsche's death to compose The Will to Power. So it was essential to reestablish the exact chronology. This explains why the first volume, The Gay Science, is more than half composed of previously unpublished fragments dating from 1881-1882. Our conception of Nietzsche's thought as well as his creative process may be profoundly altered as a result. The new edition will appear simultaneously in Italy, Germany, and France. But we owe the texts to the work of two Italians, Colli and Montinari.

**Dumur**: How do you explain that Italians rather than Germans did the job?

**Deleuze**: Maybe the Germans were not in a good position to do it. They already had numerous editions, which they were fond of, despite the arbitrary organization of the notes. Also, Nietzsche's manuscripts were in Weimar, East Germanywhere the Italians were better received than any West German could have hoped to be. Finally, the Germans were undoubtedly embarrassed at having accepted the edition of The Will to Power created by Nietzsche's sister. Elizabeth Forster-Nietzsche put together an extremely harmful work that privileges many Nazi interpretations. She didn't falsify the texts, but we know well enough that there are other ways to distort an author's thinking, even if it is merely an arbitrary selection from among his papers. Nietzschean concepts like those of "force" or "master" are complex enough to be betrayed by a selection such as hers.

**Dumur**: Will the translations be new?

**Deleuze**: Completely new. This is especially important for those writings toward the end (there have been some poor readings, for which Elizabeth Nietzsche and Peter Gast are responsible). The first two volumes to be published, The Gay Science and Human, All Too Human, have been translated by Pierre Klossowski and Robert Rovini. This doesn't mean that the prior translations by Henri Albert, and by Genevieve Bianquis, were badnot at all. But if they were determined to publish Nietzsche's notes with his works, they had to begin from scratch and unify the terminology. On that note, interestingly enough, Nietzsche was first introduced in France not by the "right," but by Charles Andler and Henri Albert, who represented a whole socialist tradition with anarchical colorings.

**Dumur**: Do you think a "return to Nietzsche" is taking place in France today? And if so, why is it?

**Deleuze**: It's difficult to say. Maybe there has been a change, or maybe the change is taking place now, with respect to the modes of thought which have been so familiar to us since the Liberation. We were used to thinking dialectically, historically. Today it seems the tide has turned from dialectical thinking toward structuralism, for example, as well as other systems of thought.

Foucault insists on the importance of the techniques of interpretation. It's possible that in the actual idea of interpretation is something which goes beyond the dialectical opposition between "knowing" and "transforming" the world. Freud is the great interpreter, so is Nietzsche, but in a different way. Nietzsche's idea is that things and actions are already interpretations. So to interpret is to interpret interpretations, and thus to change things, "to change life." What is clear for Nietzsche is that society cannot be an ultimate authority. The ultimate authority is creation, it is art: or rather, art represents the absence and the impossibility of an ultimate authority. From the very beginning of his work, Nietzsche posits that there exist ends "just a little higher" than those of the State, than those of society. He inserts his entire corpus in a dimension which is neither historical, even understood dialectically, nor eternal. What he calls this new dimension which operates both in time and against time is the untimely. It is in this that life as interpretation finds its source. Maybe the reason for the "return to Nietzsche" is a rediscovery of the untimely, that dimension which is distinct both from classical philosophy in its "timeless" enterprise and from dialectical philosophy in its understanding of history: a singular element of upheaval.

**Dumur**: Could we then say this is a return to individualism?

**Deleuze**: Yes, but a bizarre individualism, in which modern consciousness undoubtedly recognizes itself to some degree. Because in Nietzsche, this individualism is accompanied by a lively critique of the notions of "self" and "I." For Nietzsche there is a kind of dissolution of the self. The reaction against oppressive structures is no longer done, for him, in the name of a "self" or an "I." On the contrary, it is as though the "self" and the "I" were accomplices of those structures.

Must we say that the return to Nietzsche implies a kind of aestheticism, a renunciation of politics, an "individualism" as depersonalized as it is depoliticized? Maybe not. Politics, too, is in the business of interpretation. The untimely, which we just discussed, is never reducible to the political-historical element. But it happens from time to time that, at certain great moments, they coincide. When people die of hunger in India, such a disaster is political-historical. But when the people struggle for their liberation, there is always a coincidence of poetic acts and historical events or political actions, the glorious incarnation of something sublime or untimely. Such great coincidences are Nasser's burst of laughter when he nationalized Suez, or Castro's gestures, and that other burst of laughter, Giap's television interview. Here we have something that reminds us of Rimbaud's or Nietzsche's imperatives and which puts one over on Marxan artistic joy that comes to coincide with historical struggle. There are creators in politics, and creative movements, that are poised for a moment in history. Hitler, on the contrary, lacked to a singular degree any Nietzschean element. Hitler is not Zarathoustra. Nor is Trujillo. They represented what Nietzsche calls "the monkey of Zarathoustra." As Nietzsche said, if one wants to be "a master," it is not enough to come to power. More often than not it is the "slaves" who come to power, and who keep it, and who remain slaves while they keep it.

The masters according to Nietzsche are the untimely, those who create, who destroy in order to create, not to preserve. Nietzsche says that under the huge earth-shattering events are tiny silent events, which he likens to the creation of new worlds: there once again you see the presence of the poetic under the historical. In France, for instance, there are no earth-shattering events right now. They are far away, and horrible, in Vietnam. But we still have tiny imperceptible events, which maybe announce an exodus from today's desert. Maybe the return to Nietzsche is one of those "tiny events" and already a reinterpretation of the world.

     Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed 

    The dear repose for limbs with travel tired;

    But then begins a journey in my head 

    To work my mind, when bodys works expird:

    For then my thoughtsfrom far where I abide 

    Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee, 

    And keep my drooping eyelids open wide, 

    Looking on darkness which the blind do see: 

    Save that my souls imaginary sight 

    Presents thy shadow to my sightless view, 

    Which, like a jewel hung in ghastly night, 

    Makes black night beauteous and her old face new.

    Lo! thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind, 

    For thee, and for myself no quiet find. 
 



















 At that sound the bent shape of the king sprang suddenly erect. Tall and proud he seemed again; and rising in his stirrups he cried in a loud voice, more clear than any there had ever heard a mortal man achieve before:

  Arise, arise, Riders of Thoden!

  Fell deeds awake: fire and slaughter!

  Spear shall be shaken, shield be splintered,

  A sword-day, a red day, ere the sun rises!

  Ride now, ride now! Ride to Gondor!

With that he seized a great horn from Guthlf his banner-bearer, and he blew such a blast upon it that it burst asunder. And straightway all the horns in the host were lifted up in music, and the blowing of the horns of Rohan in that hour was like a storm upon the plain and a thunder in the mountains.

   Ride now, ride now! Ride to Gondor!

Suddenly the king cried to Snowmane and the horse sprang away. Behind him his banner blew in the wind, white horse upon a field of green, but he outpaced it. After him thundered the knights of his house, but he was ever before them. omer rode there, the white horsetail on his helm floating in his speed, and the front of the first ored roared like a breaker foaming to the shore, but Thoden could not be overtaken. Fey he seemed, or the battle-fury of his fathers ran like new fire in his veins, and he was borne up on Snowmane like a god of old, even as rome the Great in the battle of the Valar when the world was young. His golden shield was uncovered, and lo! it shone like an image of the Sun, and the grass flamed into green about the white feet of his steed. For morning came, morning and a wind from the sea; and darkness was removed, and the hosts of Mordor wailed, and terror took them, and they fled, and died, and the hoofs of wrath rode over them. And then all the host of Rohan burst into song, and they sang as they slew, for the joy of battle was on them, and the sound of their singing that was fair and terrible came even to the City. 



















 *"If you started in the wrong way," I said in answer to the investigator's questions, "everything that happened
would be a proof of the conspiracy against you. It would all be selfvalidating. You couldn't draw a breath
without knowing it was part of the plot."*

*"So you think you know where madness lies?"*

*My answer was a convinced and heartfelt, "Yes."*

*"And you couldn't control it?"*

*"No I couldn't control it. If one began with fear and hate as the major premise, one would have to go on the
conclusion."*

*"Would you be able," my wife asked, " to fix your attention on what The Tibetan Book of the Dead calls the
Clear Light?"*

*I was doubtful.*

*"Would it keep the evil away, if you could hold it? Or would you not be able to hold it?"*

*I considered the question for some time. "Perhaps," I answered at last, "perhaps I could  but only if there were
somebody there to tell me about the Clear Light. One couldn't do it by oneself. That's the point, I suppose, of the
Tibetan ritual  somebody sitting there all the time and telling you what's what."*

[Aldous Huxley, 'Doors of Perception', 5758]


**I. General Introduction**


A psychedelic experience is a journey to new realms of consciousness. The scope and content of the experience
is limitless, but its characteristic features are the transcendence of verbal concepts, of spacetime dimensions,
and of the ego or identity. Such experiences of enlarged consciousness can occur in a variety of ways: sensory
deprivation, yoga exercises, disciplined meditation, religious or aesthetic ecstasies, or spontaneously. Most
recently they have become available to anyone through the ingestion of psychedelic drugs such as LSD,
psilocybin, mescaline, DMT, etc. [This is the statement of an ideal, not an actual situation, in 1964. The
psychedelic drugs are in the United States classified as "experimental" drugs. That is, they are not available on a
prescription basis, but only to "qualified investigators." The Federal Food and Drug Administration has defined
"qualified investigators" to mean psychiatrists working in a mental hospital setting, whose research is sponsored
by either state or federal agencies.]

Of course, the drug dose does not produce the transcendent experience. It merely acts as a chemical key  it
opens the mind, frees the nervous system of its ordinary patterns and structures. The nature of the experience
depends almost entirely on set and setting. Set denotes the preparation of the individual, including his
personality structure and his mood at the time. Setting is physical  the weather, the room's atmosphere; social 
feelings of persons present towards one another; and cultural  prevailing views as to what is real. It is for this
reason that manuals or guidebooks are necessary. Their purpose is to enable a person to understand the new
realities of the expanded consciousness, to serve as road maps for new interior territories which modern science
has made accessible.

Different explorers draw different maps. Other manuals are to be written based on different models  scientific,
aesthetic, therapeutic. The Tibetan model, on which this manual is based, is designed to teach the person to
direct and control awareness in such a way as to reach that level of understanding variously called liberation,
illumination, or enlightenment. If the manual is read several times before a session is attempted, and if a trusted
person is there to remind and refresh the memory of the voyager during the experience, the consciousness will
be freed from the games which comprise "personality" and from positivenegative hallucinations which often
accompany states of expanded awareness. The Tibetan Book of the Dead was called in its own language the
Bardo Thodol, which means "Liberation by Hearing on the AfterDeath Plane." The book stresses over and over
that the free consciousness has only to hear and remember the teachings in order to be liberated.

The Tibetan Book of the Dead is ostensibly a book describing the experiences to be expected at the moment of
death, during an intermediate phase lasting fortynine (seven times seven) days, and during rebirth into another
bodily frame. This however is merely the exoteric framework which the Tibetan Buddhists used to cloak their
mystical teachings. The language and symbolism of death rituals of Bonism, the traditional preBuddhist
Tibetan religion, were skillfully blended with Buddhist conceptions. The esoteric meaning, as it has been
interpreted in this manual, is that it is death and rebirth that is described, not of the body. Lama Govinda
indicates this clearly in his introduction when he writes: "It is a book for the living as well as the dying." The
book's esoteric meaning is often concealed beneath many layers of symbolism. It was not intended for general
reading. It was designed to be understood only by one who was to be initiated personally by a guru into the
Buddhist mystical doctrines, into the premortemdeath rebirth experience. These doctrines have been kept a
closely guarded secret for many centuries, for fear that naive or careless application would do harm. In
translating such an esoteric text, therefore, there are two steps: one, the rendering of the original text into
English; and two, the practical interpretation of the text for its uses. In publishing this practical interpretation for
use in the psychedelic drug session, we are in a sense breaking with the tradition of secrecy and thus
contravening the teachings of the lamagurus.

However, this step is justified on the grounds that the manual will not be understood by anyone who has not had
a consciousnessexpanding experience and that there are signs that the lamas themselves, after their recent
diaspora, wish to make their teachings available to a wider public. 




      Joyful to have
     Such a human birth,
     Difficult to find,
     Free and well-favored.	

     But death is real,
     Comes without warning.
     This body
     Will be a corpse.

     Unalterable
     Are the laws of karma;
     Cause and effect
     Cannot be escaped.	

     Samsara
     Is an ocean of suffering,
     Unendurable,
     Unbearably intense.

 Talking about ethics is seen by some as rather old-fashioned, (Note however my use of the word 'highly' in the title of this post), but I would assert that some games are more ethical than others. I also think that a game can be a good game and be bad and a bad game can be good. Make of that what you will.

 Never having played it I'm not able to comment with certainty. Personally,  if I'm being honest with myself, the 'indirect good' I've experienced from playing video games is quite limited indeed. 




 It's a matter of opinion. I'd say the above games are ethical on account of the good that they do over and above passing the time and entertaining.

 Very mandala like. 









 Perhaps. There's a big difference between 'putting an end to fracking in its entirety' and not starting it where it has hitherto been illegal, however. 




 Every social society involves some form of agreement to treat your fellow members well

I don't think so. Such an agreement is certainly more explicit in Freemasonry than other groups.

 taking an oath to provide assistance to members of a group makes you incapable of acting rationally

That's not what I'm saying. Partiality and irrationality are not identical terms. 

 if you abuse the public trust, then you aren't acting as a Mason.

So long as that credo is at the forefront of their mind then good on them. When that is ignored society as a whole suffers. 

If it is the case that justice is not perverted through the existence of Freemason cabals, then I retract my insinuations to the contrary. The way things are, however, I will be offering no such retraction. 




 We can't just freeze and starve to death until someone comes up with a hydrogen car and replaces our source of the majority of our electricity. The current demand must be met, or our entire infrastructure would collapse.

You're putting the cart before the horse. If the demand and will for clean energy is there then the economy and energy industry can reorientate accordingly. The German government intends to garner 60% of energy from renewables by 2050. Other nations should follow suit. For the United Kingdom to lift its ban on fracking at this moment in time is a misstep that could have dire consequences both actually and qua gesture politics. 




 It's also the whole 'burning fossil fuels thing'. We should be looking for fewer ways to pollute the atmosphere not more. 




 The Freemason tenets of 'brotherly love' and 'relief' aren't negative in and of themselves but they become so when it enters into a sphere where equality before the law and [the principle of equal opportunities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_opportunity) should remain paramount.

    Though absent long,	

These forms of beauty have not been to me,	

As is a landscape to a blind man's eye:	

But oft, in lonely rooms, and mid the din	

Of towns and cities, I have owed to them,	

In hours of weariness, sensations sweet,	

Felt in the blood, and felt along the heart,	

And passing even into my purer mind	

With tranquil restoration:feelings too	

Of unremembered pleasure; such, perhaps,	

As may have had no trivial influence	

**On that best portion of a good man's life;**

**His little, nameless, unremembered acts**	

**Of kindness and of love.** Nor less, I trust,	

To them I may have owed another gift,	

Of aspect more sublime; that blessed mood,	

In which the burthen of the mystery,	

In which the heavy and the weary weight	

Of all this unintelligible world	

Is lighten'd:that serene and blessed mood,	

In which the affections gently lead us on,	

Until, the breath of this corporeal frame,	

And even the motion of our human blood	

Almost suspended, we are laid asleep	

In body, and become a living soul:	

While with an eye made quiet by the power	

Of harmony, and the deep power of joy,	

We see into the life of things.

 And WW2 was caused by jingoistic horseshit. But not based on. 




  Civil War deaths are based on incomplete returns

Does this mean a deserter would count as a death? I could imagine the sons and grandsons of the pioneers would have been rather prone to upping sticks and starting life anew on the hoof. Perhaps the number of 'recorded deaths' is a grossly inflated figure. 














 'Naga' is sometimes used to mean 'elephant' or a generic, large, fearsome monster, too. 














 Helpful comment. I studied this at school but was never presented with that information in such a clear way. Of course, it's a very complicated subject. One could dedicate one's life work to working it out and you could still have much to learn. I regret the charged manner in which I headed the picture. Arguably redeemed somewhat by your post. I'm sure an equally lucid case for the other side could be made. Terrible business all told. As an Englishman one can't help feel things were largely the fault of the British. Oh well....

 Does it? Also, saying how I 'differentiate video games from other forms of entertainment' wouldn't be required to make a valid and sound argument that video games are a waste of time. 




 Or maybe it was thinker or writer. I think he mentioned a desert at some point too.

for decreased empathy and prosocial behavior.

 What are some activities that you think are more useful than playing video games? 




 Nope. It was non-fiction. 




 I touch on that in the CMV thread. John Stuart Mill expresses some of my thoughts in chapter two of Utilitarianism - the section containing the famous statement about it being 'better to be Socrates unsatisfied than a pig satisfied'. I also touch on that which makes relationship between the consumer and creator of games different to the creator/consumer relationship in music and movies. In short, games require a greater acquiescence and obeisance from the consumer towards the creator than other media. Additionally, the active participation of the gamer as an agent within the game is a cause of harm. The artificiality creates anomie, through the toxic effect of the necessarily meaningless and unimportant game-world, whereas the mimesis with the real world encourages immorality/immoralism through conditioning (e.g. encouraging violence). 

I also imply, in an aside, that games bring out the bad of competitive sport (brutishness, ruthlessness, and tribalism/egoism, etc. etc. ) with none of the benefits - e.g. exercise.  




 A discussion of my statements, and my (partial) recantation can be found here: http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/26gjxf/cmv_i_believe_that_playing_video_games_is_morally/ 




 I believe that playing video games is a waste of time and a corrupting influence on an otherwise healthy human being. My first objection to video games is founded on the belief that they do nothing good. My second objection is that they do something bad. [edit for /r/philsophy: Moreover, I believe that playing video games is morally indefensible.]

I cannot think of any good that video games do. Where things that resemble video games have a practical implementation they are not called 'video games'. A pilot learning on a flight stimulator has an equivalence to an air traffic controller monitoring a graphic of in-air flights. Neither is playing a game because neither is using a tool that has real-world importance. Whereas a 'video game' is a trivial enterprise, ('game'), in a dimension that doesn't truly exist. The 'video' is just electronic pixels producing an illusion. Existence pertains to that universe that we live in. That of time, space, feeling, and suffering.

The 'unreal world' setting of video games leads to the conditions arising that result in their real-world harm. Whilst I can imagine a game developer with the best intentions trying to create a game which tries to instil good character traits in the 'gamer', I believe her attempt would be fruitless. Any encouragement of positive characteristics would necessarily be concomitant with a diminution and tainting of the 'real world' through association with the 'unreal world'. This leads to apathy and alienation.
Furthermore, if the game developer doesn't approach the project of making a game with the best of intentions then the game will inevitably enforce or reinforce bad character traits. A game that is made with disregard to encouraging moral virtues will lead to a game that encourages immorality (or amorality - as covered above). I believe that this has happened and is happening. It is well illustrated by these comments made by a leading creative

"Hardcore gamers basically love to watch the baby hit the floor. They said I want a game where I can shoot somebody in the head and blow their head off, so the gaming industry moved in that direction. So thats what theyre doing. And you cant empathize with somebody youre going to kill, so that whole idea has gone out the window."

(Games that encourage a ruthless, competitive win-at-all-costs mentality are equally guilty in their ability to clip the 'Angel's wings' that is human potential).


I believe that video games are good for nothing more than as a good example of how to waste time and corrupt. (And that there are better ways to learn such lessons!)

 OK. 




 Is there such a thing as an unwounded soldier? 




 Thus was Mr. Pickwick brought face to face with the difficulty of seeing his own counsel.  He could not understand why, having retained the services of a professional man and paid for them, there should exist any impediment to prevent access to him.  I wont discuss to-night the advisability or non-advisability of dividing the profession of the law into two parts, but I do say that any system which prevents litigants having the fullest personal communication with those they have paid to represent them is an anomaly and an absurdity.

But Mr. Pickwick was a person of determination, and he did see Serjeant Snubbin, and he delivered to that learned gentleman a short address that was well worthy of his attention, as it is of every member of the Bar, including your very humble servant.

Gentlemen of your profession, sir, continued Mr. Pickwick, see the worst side of human nature.  All its disputes, all its ill-will and bad blood, rise up before you.  You know from your experience of juries (I mean no disparagement to you, or them) how much depends upon effect; and you are apt to attribute to others a desire to use, for purposes of deception and self-interest, the very instruments which you, in pure honesty and honour of purpose, and with a laudable desire to do your utmost for your client, know the temper and worth of so well, from constantly employing them yourselves.  I really believe that to this circumstance may be attributed the vulgar but very general notion of your being, as a body, suspicious, distrustful, and overcautious.  Conscious as I am, sir, of the disadvantage of making such a declaration to you, under such circumstances, I have come here, because I wish you distinctly to understand, as my friend Mr. Perker has said, that I am innocent of the falsehood laid to my charge; and although I am very well aware of the inestimable value of your assistance, sir, I must beg to add that, unless you sincerely believe this, I would rather be deprived of the aid of your talents than have the advantage of them.

 Some good and bad arguments either way. See if you can add to them. 









 [In 1904, Elizabeth "Lizzie" Magie designed a board game to demonstrate the tragic effects of land-grabbing. In this game, oligarchs enrich themselves at the expense of tenants, the latter of whom only grow poorer as available land decreases and the cost of rent increases. Anyone interested in traveling a non-trivial distance has to pony up for a railroad ticket. Anyone desiring light and water had better open their wallet. And crossing the wrong landowner sends a player directly to jail. The poorer the proletarian player gets, the more he or she is squeezed; there is nowhere to go that doesnt demand a fee of some kind, and there is no respite. The game ends only when everyone is driven penniless into the ground, but for a single aristocrat who now owns everything. Lizzie Magie named her grim reflection of life The Landlords Game, but you probably know it better as Monopoly.](http://mentalfloss.com/article/48787/retrobituaries-elizabeth-lizzie-magie-inventor-monopoly)

 Why?  









 Last time I got a BSOD I got a few in quick succession. I deleted recently downloaded software and it went away so I think it was definitely that then. That made me think it was that reason this time too. I've had a disconcerting rattling from my laptop recently so it's probably/possibly linked to that and not software after all. 




 It was your tone as much as anything. The Buddha was said to have combined intelligence with love. This is an advanced practise - one requiring speed and deliberation, precision and equanimity, strength and tenderness. It has been said that 'hatred is the near enemy of intelligence'. Can you understand how that might be the case? 




 I have 'delta'd' someone who, to my mind, managed to deserve it. One's man's argument is another's debate. Whilst I was curter than I would have liked to have been as a result of needing to keep up with the oncoming traffic and not neglect anyone (that is until this thread was censored and civilisation's progress impeded in the process), I believe I have helped expose some 'home truths' to those who would otherwise not have heard it through the moans of enablers, nor smelt it through the fetid miasma of their own inertia and self-deceit and have learnt one or two things myself about the brave, unheralded labours of some of my fellow men and women of science who are attempting to redeem video games.

I will only change to improve! Semper fidelis!  




  #8710;

Sadly ~~one of~~ the mods ~~(_____)~~ has deleted this thread so people won't get to see your helpful post. Which is a shame because it might have stopped less people dying from horrible, currently incurable diseases in the future. Because of ~~_____'s~~ actions (which I believe are the result of being 'butthurt' over having her 'holy-cow' of video games openly disparaged) many more people may die long, slow painful deaths than would have otherwise.

I must emphasise however that I am giving you the Changer's Cap for your help sciencey game links - they could (potentially) be useful whilst still being little more than a numbing (nay, infantilising) pastime for the player (as is common to all video games) - and not your last two points.

Your spouse point is not a good one. They will become each other's [enablers](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=enabler) and probably(/possibly?) bring disappointment to their friends and relatives.

As for playing Lego, St. Paul said it well when he said 'When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.'

 ...Alienation and reification are the two ideas most commonly
associated with critical theory. The former is usually identified
with the psychological effects of exploitation and the division of
labor, and the latter with how people are treated instrumentally, as
things, through concepts that have been ripped from their
historical context. Pioneering studies of alienation and reification
had already been undertaken by Western Marxists during the
1920s, but the Frankfurt School provided a unique sense of how
these complex categories impacted upon individuals in advanced
industrial society.

They investigated the ways in which thinking was being reduced
to mechanical notions of what is operative and profitable, ethical
reflection was tending to vanish, and aesthetic enjoyment was
becoming more standardized. Critical theorists noted with alarm
how interpreting modern society was becoming ever more
difficult. Alienation and reification were thus analyzed in terms of
how they imperiled the exercise of subjectivity, robbed the world
of meaning and purpose, and turned the individual into a cog in
the machine.

Auschwitz was seen as incarnating the most radical implications
of alienation and reification. It was the watershed event that
shattered optimistic assumptions about progress even more
radically than the Lisbon earthquake did during the eighteenth
century. With images of the Nazi concentration camps still fresh,
Hiroshima and Nagasaki destroyed, new reports emerging about
the Soviet Gulag, and McCarthyism on the rise in the United
States, it appeared to the Frankfurt School as if Western
civilization had generated not human development but an
unparalleled barbarism. They knew that something more was
required from radical thought than the usual stale critique of
capitalism....

 Dear Leo,

I still await with palpitating eagerness the 18-page letter that you have promised me. I imagine that it will be something in the nature of an epica soul-exposing, world-defying human documentand I am asking in advance for the publication rights in Boston. Upon receiving your MS I will Fanny Butcher it something like this:

"Leo Adams, a small town boy who made good in Chicago and went to New York to let his hair down has just aroused the interest (to say nothing of the passions) of his contemporaries with one of the boldest American literary efforts since Eddie Guest he could write poetry. His story will live in the anals of literature.

"Working with a modern metre, a Washington Square setting and a limited vocabulary, he carries us back to the daze of Greece when Socrates went blind with passion at the sight of the limbs of a youth and when all a young boy had to do to be successful was to get under a good man and work his way up.

"Though sadly hampered by the English language's notorious lack of synonyms for the capital "I", Mr. Adams reinforces his style with the sincerity of his belief in himself and savors it with a sensuality so austere that one is led to believe that he himself is more staid than stayed with.

"His purple interludes are at once reminiscent of Oscar Wilde and Frank Harris. He is not, of course as Wilde as Oscar but neither is he, on the other hand, as Frank as Harris, though if sufficiently Harrised he might go Wilde.

"If left alone, this young man will go far but we doubt if he will find his way back."

He was in the fields, when I came back.

In between, what long hours,

What centuries might have elapsed.

Did he look up? His arm half

Lifted was more to ward off

My foolishness. You will return,

He intimated; the heart's roots

Are here under this black soil

I labour at. A change of wind

Can bring the smooth town to a stop;

The grass whispers beneath the flags;

Every right word on your tongue

Has a green taste. It is the mind

Calling you, eager to paint

Its distances; but the truth's here,

Closer than the world will confess,

In this bare bone of life that I pick.

To cars going the other way we were a quick loud noise, a flash; seen from aboveeven a crop duster would have given you the perspectivewe were nothing like thatnot loud, not powerful, not affecting much at all, not leaving any ruin, not making any noisewe were just some little black thing puttering straight on the straight road, producing only the smallest buzzing sound, crawling through this flat, terrible grid.

 The ensuing morning brought reflection with it, as morning usually does; but widely different was the train of thought it awakened in the different persons who had been so unexpectedly brought together on the preceding evening...

The reflections of Sir Mulberry Hawkif such a term can be applied to the thoughts of the systematic and calculating man of dissipation, whose joys, regrets, pains, and pleasures, are all of self, and who would seem to retain nothing of the intellectual faculty but the power to debase himself, and to degrade the very nature whose outward semblance he wearsthe reflections of Sir Mulberry Hawk turned upon Kate Nickleby, and were, in brief, that she was undoubtedly handsome; that her coyness MUST be easily conquerable by a man of his address and experience, and that the pursuit was one which could not fail to redound to his credit, and greatly to enhance his reputation with the world. And lest this last considerationno mean or secondary one with Sir Mulberryshould sound strangely in the ears of some, let it be remembered that most men live in a world of their own, and that in that limited circle alone are they ambitious for distinction and applause. Sir Mulberry's world was peopled with profligates, and he acted accordingly.

Thus, cases of injustice, and oppression, and tyranny, and the most extravagant bigotry, are in constant occurrence among us every day. It is the custom to trumpet forth much wonder and astonishment at the chief actors therein setting at defiance so completely the opinion of the world; but there is no greater fallacy; it is precisely because they do consult the opinion of their own little world that such things take place at all, and strike the great world dumb with amazement.

 Provision of mental health services for young people varies widely across England, with entry-level care largely funded by local authorities, which are trying to slash spending.


Research has found young people who do not receive help in the early stages of their illness can suffer serious consequences, often needing time in hospital or remaining ill during adulthood.

Young Minds submitted a Freedom of Information request about funding of child and adolescent mental health services for 2014-15 and the previous four financial years.

It had responses from 99 out of the 151 councils it contacted.

More than half had made cuts over the last five years, while nine councils had kept funding at the same level.

The biggest reduction was at Birmingham City Council, from just above 2.3m in 2010-11 to 125,000 in 2014-15, a drop of 94%

 Very useful. Some stuff on there I'd not come across before - or certainly not in such a succinct form.

I'd translate it as 'experiencing happiness in the happiness of others'. A lot of the Sanskrit and Pali origins are well worth checking out further.

Seeing the delight of others in this cheat sheet is a good opportunity to bask in some mudita, mind. :)

 1941 




 Remember the fuss about a Danish cartoon depicting the prophet Muhammad? I still think the anger of some Muslims silly. But inexplicable? Ive had to think again.

[...]Dorothy L Sayers [was suggested as a topic] for my Radio 4 series 'Great Lives'. Sayers, a committed Anglican, wrote a cycle of plays about Jesus, 'The Man Born to be King', which the BBC broadcast in the 1940s. There was outrage. Heres the Lords Day Observance Society, whose formal complaint to the BBC spoke  believe it or not  for many conservative Christians:

Christian people have been shocked at the announcement of the proposed impersonation of our Lord Jesus Christ in a Sunday Play on the wireless . . . the first time a radio impersonation of Christ has been attempted anywhere in the world . . . bordering on the blasphemous . . . a contemplated violation of the Third Commandment which forbids taking the Name of God in vain.

That was little more than 70 years ago. Today we would struggle to understand how there could even have been an issue. Listen now and the only thing that might surprise you is how posh theyve made Jesus: He sounds like a Conservative MP.

Piya Tan glosses it along the lines of 'don't turn the Buddhist teachings/way of life into a commercial enterprise'.

I think it could be understood to have a metaphysical as well as an ethical dimension. The Dharma should be its own reward. You don't follow the Dharma to receive something other than the Dharma; you act according to the Dharma and consequently it is the Dharma you receive. 

A banana trader would expect to receive, say, money for his bananas. A devotee of the Buddha who expects to trade the Dharma for money in a similar fashion would be acting wrong-headedly.

 *L'esprit de l'escalier* literally translates as 'the spirit of the stairs'. The saying evokes passing someone on a flight of stairs and wanting to have said something but only thinking of it a few moments too late as, say, you have gone up and they have gone down. One only realises the best thing to say after more time spent thinking (conscious rumination or subconscious gestation). I was punning on 'stairs'. Both stairs, and 'reflection and doing nothing' elevate one.

Edit: I remember now that the pun worked on another level too: *l'espirit d'escalier* is the key to going deeper. Typical *l'esprit d'escalier* - remembering to add this now! 




 I know that's how it's used. I was deliberately being more expansive.

 Good to hear. 




 Specifically referring to allegations of torture:

**The Winter Soldier Investigation**

In Detroit in 1971, several soldiers described incidents of torture, though they
refused to name the soldiers who had tortured.^51 ... They gave their own names and
presented their discharge papers, identifying when and where they had served,
and they detailed when and where torture occurred. The soldiers at Winter
Soldier did not describe bizarre tortures never reported elsewhere, as in other
accounts, and at least as far as torture is concerned, there is nothing here to
make one question Senator Mark Hatfields decision to read this account into
the Congressional Record in 1971....

Steve Noetzel offers the earliest account of American telephone torture,
situating it in the Mekong Delta region between 1963 and 1964.^52 Soldiers who
served in the mid-1960s repeatedly mention telephone torture and less commonly
beating. There are two accounts describing the use of dogs in torture
and singular accounts of suspension, water torture, and ear boring.^53 One soldier
describes an incident of field interrogation using knives in which the prisoner
was killed because the medics would have become suspicious.^54

Don Dzagulones, a former military interrogator, gave the most detailed
account of interrogation and torture. Dzagulones described field telephone torture
as well as dehydration, which left nothing that was traceable.^55 As in
other testimonials, Dzagulones does not mention official training for torture.
Rather, he describes how commanders in Vietnam exercised benign neglect
(If people did find out about it, they just let it go, because it was an accepted
practice). He also describes how he learned techniques... after the official instructors turned the class over to Vietnam
veterans (invariably the instruction would turn to various methods that
theyd seen or heard or used in torturing people in Vietnam).^56 ...

Let me turn now to the criticisms of Winter Soldier. Guenter Lewy has
sharply questioned the accounts soldiers provided. In particular, he sharply criticized
the unwillingness of soldiers to name those who committed war crimes,
arguing that in American jurisprudence, guilt is always personal. Lewy also
summarized the results of the investigation of the Winter Soldier allegations by
the Naval Investigative Service. The most damaging finding consisted of the
sworn statements of several veterans, corroborated by witnesses, that they had
in fact not attended the hearing in Detroit. One of them had never been in
Detroit all his life. He did not know, he stated, who might have used his name.
The report also identifies another soldier, an African-American, who asserted
that a member of the Nation of Islam helped him prepare his testimony.^59

But the appearance of exactitude here is deceptive. Unlike other critics,
such as Sheehan and Moyar, who have exposed fabricators by name using unclassified
military files, Lewy does not give the names of the fake speakers at
Winter Soldier, and guilt, as he so correctly states, is an individual matter. Collective
sin belongs to theology, not history, and it is a mistake to tar everyone
at Winter Soldier with the faults of specific individuals. In 2004, Lewy was no
longer certain whether he saw the file that described these allegations. In an
interview with the Baltimore Sun, Lewy states that he does not recall if he saw
a copy of the naval investigative report or was briefed on its contents.^60 The
cursory bibliographic information, which offers neither the date of the investigation
nor a reference number, suggests he never saw it.


Efforts to find this file have thus far failed. The Suns reporters were not
able to secure it, and Paul ODonnell, the spokesman for the Naval Criminal
Investigative Service, reported that they were searching for a copy of the report.
^61 In addition, a military librarian with access to classified databases was
unable to find the file listed in any database. Perhaps one day a FOIA request
will recover this file and two other files Lewy cites.

The lack of names, the probable oral character of the summary, and the
absence of the hard copy raise troubling questions about Lewys allegations.
Furthermore, during the 2004 presidential campaign, conservative groups put
a great deal of energy into finding anyone who would discredit the Winter
Soldier investigations. If, as Lewy insists, there were veterans who were outraged
that someone used their name falsely to make claims of atrocities in Vietnam,
this was the time for them to have come forward. But by the end of fall 2004,
only one soldier came forward, Steven J. Pitkin.^62 If Pitkins account is true,
it does not fit the allegations in the NIS file. Pitkin does not state someone
impersonated him at Winter Soldier; rather he retracts the account he offered
there. So where were the several soldiers whose were so outrageously impersonated
at Winter Soldier? And where was the African American who had received
help from the Nation of Islam in preparing his testimony?


There are also troubling questions about the Pitkin affidavit. Pitkin apparently
filed his affidavit twice. His first affidavit was filed on August 31, 2004,
and it was immediately contested. Another veteran, Scott Camil, filed his own
affidavit on September 11, 2004, pointing to falsehoods in the Pitkin affidavit.^63
Pitkin subsequently filed a new affidavit on September 15, 2004. This new affidavit
was surprising in its own right since his close friend from the 1970s, Nancy
Miller Saunders, believed he was dead.^64 At any rate, Pitkins new affidavit states
that he falsely described incidents of rape, brutality, atrocities and racism at
the urging of presidential candidate John Kerry.^65 This is problematic for another
reason: Pitkins statement at Winter Soldier does not describe incidents
of rape, brutality, or other atrocities. Pitkin speaks thrice in the transcripts of
Winter Soldier. The first and longest testimony is a generic statement about
the dehumanization caused by war. Here, Pitkin uses the word atrocity to describe
U.S. press coverage and his army training stateside, but not to describe
specific incidents of violence in Vietnam...


One last fact raises questions about the political motivation behind the
affidavit. Pitkin is the easiest veteran to associate with John Kerry at Winter
Soldier because he is the only one to appear with him on film. It is thought provoking
that given all the soldiers Lewy claims were impersonated at Winter
Soldier, only and especially Pitkin came forward to denounce it.


At the moment, then, Pitkins affidavit seems unreliable and Lewys claims
about Winter Soldier are as nearly hearsay as the ones he is criticizing. Recently,
a group of anti-Kerry veterans have received and made available some
21,477 pages of FBI documents on the Vietnam Veterans Against the War.^67
Perhaps in time, the lost file or FBI files similar to it will appear, allowing one
to identify the liars. But the continued absence of the Naval Investigative File
suggests that Lewys contact deliberately misled him and Lewy mistakenly
found the contact convincing.


Two other features of Lewys discussion of torture are also troubling, suggesting
that his assessment of American torture in Vietnam is less than evenhanded.
Despite his criticism of testimonials about American torture in South
Vietnam, Lewy is quick to accept testimonial literature when it pertains to
Communist torture. Unable to show North Vietnamese government documents
authorizing torture, he argues nevertheless that the uniformity in the
testimonial literature suggests that torture was government policy. Lewy faults
gullible antiwar criticism, arguing that they should have known the North Vietnamese
would torture given past testimonials about Communist practice during
the Korean and Franco-Vietnamese wars.^68

This is the standard application of the Nuremberg rule of course: uniformity
of practice indicates uniformity of intent. Indeed, there are important continuities
in Communist torture practices, although the testimonial literature
also indicates significant variations during the Vietnamese and Korean conflicts,
as I document in chapters 3 and 17. Lewy is right to criticize the antiwar
critics on this point. By the same token, however, the French tortured in Vietnam
as did the South Vietnamese, and the uniform pattern for the latter also
strongly suggested that the South Vietnamese had an official torture policy too.
Lewy mentions South Vietnamese torture in one sentence, stating only that the
ARVN was known for their bad treatment and torture of captured VC. Lewy
does not even mention French torture during the Vietnamese conflict.^69

It seems odd that Lewy applies one set of rules for acceptable evidence and
interpretation for Communist torture and quite another for American torture.
Lewy is correct that retrospective testimony about the past is highly problematic,
but so too is proximate testimony. Proximity to the incident may occlude
judgment and perspective, and the real situation may become more apparent
with time. General Massu believed that torture was effective and necessary at
the time he acted in Algeria, but came, correctly, to the opposite conclusion
thirty years later. Does this mean his later testimony is false or unreliable? Again,
it is rather surprising that Lewy does not even mention this possibility, seeking
to rule out all retrospective testimonial literature in principle when it comes to
American veterans testimonies of torture.^70 ... 

Ultimately though,
the testimonial evidence does not disagree too much with the position Lewy
wants to defend, namely, that torture was not official government policy issued
from Washington, DC. The testimonial evidence describes instead a local,
semiofficial policy that existed for all the reasons Lewy outlines.

From *Torture and Democracy* (2007) by Darius Rejali 




 I googled a name at random off that CID document. He still upheld his testimony in an interview in 2010. 

More convincingly, the book *Torture and Democracy* by Darius Rejali contains the following passage in the Appendix - 'A Note on Sources for American Torture during
the Vietnam War':

Furthermore, during the 2004 presidential campaign, conservative groups put
a great deal of energy into finding anyone who would discredit the Winter
Soldier investigations. If, as Lewy insists, there were veterans who were outraged
that someone used their name falsely to make claims of atrocities in Vietnam,
this was the time for them to have come forward. But by the end of fall 2004,
only one soldier came forward, Steven J. Pitkin.^62 If Pitkins account is true,
it does not fit the allegations in the NIS file. Pitkin does not state someone
impersonated him at Winter Soldier; rather he retracts the account he offered
there. So where were the several soldiers whose were so outrageously impersonated
at Winter Soldier? And where was the African American who had received
help from the Nation of Islam in preparing his testimony?

 My suggestion is to not play them. Playing video games is a waste of time. Your time can be put to better use. 




 Since the first day of the WSI event and for more than thirty years since, individuals and organizations have sought to discredit or at least minimize the painful revelations brought forth at that event. Critics have claimed that participants were frauds; that they were told to not cooperate with later investigators; that their testimonies were inaccurate or just plain fabricated. To date, no records of fraudulent participants or fraudulent testimony have been produced.

 **1 January, 1839**. Talked of my getting on in Oliver Twist; of the descriptions
of squalid vice in it; of the accounts of starvation in the Workhouses and
Schools, Mr. Dickens gives in his books. Lord M[elbourne - the Prime Minister] says, in many schools they
give children the worst things to eat, and bad beer, to save expense; told him
Mamma admonished me for reading light books.

**Sunday, 7th April 1839.** Lord M. was talking of some dish or other, and
alluded to something in Oliver Twist; he read half of the 1st vol. at Panshanger.
Its all among Workhouses, and Coffin Makers, and Pickpockets, he said; I
dont like that low debasing style; its all slang; its just like The Beggars Opera;
I shouldnt think it would tend to raise morals; I dont like that low debasing
view of mankind. We defended Oliver very much, but in vain. I dont like
those things; I wish to avoid them; I dont like them in reality, and therefore
I dont wish to see them represented, he continued; that everything one read
should be pure and elevating. Schiller and Goethe would have been shocked
at such things, he said. Lehzen said they would not have disliked reading
them. She dont know her own literature, said Lord M., for that Goethe
said one ought never to see anything disagreeable; he wouldnt look upon
the dead; and thats just the same thing. Its a bad taste, he continued,
which will pass away like any other, but depend upon it, while it lasts its a
bad, depraved, vicious taste; now just read Jonathan Wild, he said to Lord
Torrington, and Amelia, and see if it isnt just the same thing.
