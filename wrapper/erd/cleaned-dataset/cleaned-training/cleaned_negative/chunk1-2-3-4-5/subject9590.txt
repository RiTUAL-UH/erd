 equals one of my balls being the size of a clementine  




 Thanks for the figurative slap in the face you are right but emotions are powerful things 




 Think I'm gonna retaliate with doxycyclin and learning from this experience sorry to disappoint you 




 This seems to be the general consensus of the thread and I would like to thank all of you for not letting my emotions get the better of me 




 Drunk plus how good sex feels without a condom equals I'm a dumbass 




 I let my emotions get the better of me cause I'm fucking pissed off. Everyone in this thread is right doing anything to him is childish and not going to change anything in the long run 




 Then I find out I'm a horrible judge of character and lose faith in humanity 




 A little fucking callous but you make good points. 




 You could be completely right but I'm usually a very untrusting person because I have had the shit manipulated out of me before. She has proven herself to me thus far but of course she could just be a manipulative bitch and be incredibly good about it. If i find out that's true goddamn I don't know if I could trust anyone ever again. 




 Like I said i trust her a lot and I'm usually a very cynical person. You could definitely be right but I think I'm a good judging people and she has proven herself to me though. But everyone in this thread saying to be the better man are correct. I'm letting my emotions get the better of me. 




 She figured out he was cheating on her about a week after she had gotten an STD test and was clean. She dumped him immediately afterwards and we met about month later. I now have chlamydia and epididymitis because of an admittedly lapse in judgement on my part(bareback).

Her last boyfriend was obviously a huge piece of shit. I trust her story 100% because she got an IUD and had to get tested before that. I had also gotten tested recently and the only girl I have fucked since then is her. I am 99.9999% sure that I am the only guy she has fucked since the breakup, we have a very open and trusting relationship.

I just found out about the STD so obviously emotions are running pretty high. He not only cheated on this girl that I care for a lot but also gave us both chlamydia. What would you do in this situation reddit?

**EDIT**: One of the first times reddit has actually been productive for me instead of counterproductive. Y'all are right I am letting my emotions getting the better of me and this is mostly my fault

 I suggest watch the documentary When you're strange. It's narrated by Johnny Depp and tell the story of the Doors in a very entertaining way. Although I guess you'd have to fuck up hard to make something about Jim Morrison's life not entertaining.

If you like that read the biography No One Here Gets Out Alive

 Let's face it, this school is fucking hard... especially when professors refuse to give out practice tests or only give out one(*cough* physics department *cough*). I think it would benefit everyone if we put together a r/gatech word server where anyone could upload materials from classes they previously took(like a fraternity or sorority word). I could probably set something up if there's any interest... 




 Oh all the time. One time a few friends and I were tripping on acid and we decided to throw milkdrop up on one of the projectors. Got a few weird looks from the kids trying to study(fucking nerds) but it was a great experience 




 I don't think reddit would benefit from people ignoring this so much as not misinterpreting it. It's not saying plagiarize and copy, it's saying take things that speak to you from various sources and make them your own.

 For some reason, my hands and feet sweat excessively at all times. Even as I'm typing this now, I can feel the grimy, clammy sweat building up on my hands and it's really uncomfortable. This always makes handshakes pretty awkward, I definitely would be pretty grossed out if I shook someone's hand only to find it wet with sweat. Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this? Of course I know the ol' wipe your hands on your pants trick, but that just doesn't quite cut it for me any more...

I can do a decent posh accent(or so I've been told by actual british people) and I've thought about just one day starting to talk in a british accent and never stopping. Sure I'd loose all my friends probably but eventually I could make new friends who wouldn't know I'm actually american. I'd get so many more chicks that way it'd be awesome 




 Hmmm, how about saying it was an interesting movie made me think about things I never would have thought about before? Does that make me sound stupid?
 









 Jim Morrison for sure 




 Yeah, he has a ton of really mind blowing videos. My favorite is where he somehow subconsciously convinces like 30 mall goers to raise their hands in the air at the same time with just a few announcements over the loudspeaker.

Honestly, I can't help but be skeptical that he didn't stage some of his videos but everything I've watched paints him as a honest down to earth guy who wouldn't stage things just to increase his ratings.

Here's the video if anyone's interested: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOEKdaXIEHc

 Get outside man. Go hiking or something. Go look at nature and try to comprehend the trillions of complex organic reactions that are occurring right before your eyes.

 Wow I never knew how much of an asshole Edison was. Electrocuting an elephant in front of a crowd of people proves nothing and I'm sure he knew that, its just the general public didn't have much of an understanding of electricity at the time.

 I don't get this viewpoint at all. Technology has progressed enough so that things like instant replay can be used in soccer. Sure coming up with rules so that this could be implemented without drastically changing the game play will take a bit of thought but I believe it is possible. 

In this world cup, in almost every single game I've watched, the refs have made at least one bad call that would have been overturned by an instant replay. Why would you resist trying to make the game more fair? That goal England scored yesterday would have drastically changed the game. The disputed goal this article talks about would have drastically changed the game. 

Change is a good thing if it's done right.

 I took a 4000 level intro to neuroscience class last semester and it blew my mind. What defines 'you', your personality, inhibitions, vocabulary and memory is in fact tangible and malleable.

 Yeah mental illness scares the fuck out of me, I read a story here from a paramedic send to a girls house by her mother because she was having an episode again.

He walked into the house and found the girl sitting by herself in the living room. Apparently as he walked in she stared at him for about 30 seconds and that stood up completely inhuman way that he said looked like something a human could never do. She then said something along the lines of I am the devil incarnate. She then held her hand up in way it seemed like she was holding something and said to him I Hold here the key to enter the gates of hell and walked up to him.
He has absolutely no belief in the supernatural and he still said it was the scariest thing that has ever happened to him and it still freaks him the fuck out to this day. 




 So say the main character of this game is a paranoid schizophrenic. For example maybe he is the only person in this world to have telekinesis or something along these lines and despite his mental illness he has to overcome it to save the world. You would have to deal with that, all along dealing with things like hearing voices, hallucinations and other paranoid schizophrenic presents. You wouldn't be able to tell what was real and what wasn't although maybe there would be a subtle ability to recognize a pattern to get to the bottom of this. The game would be a total mind fuck but it would be really interesting to deal with problems and eye opening for people who don't know much about this disease 




 I think you should reread my post man. Dont think you fully understood it

 So recently I've been on a huge comedy kick and I'm looking for more shows to keep this bender going. I love seinfeld and curb, WLIIA, scrubs, seasons 2-12 of the Simpsons, Aqua Teen Hunger Force, Metalocalypse, squidbillies, superjail, venture bros, and a ton more there's no need to list. As you can see my tastes are really diverse and I'm open to anything, recommend me a hilarious new show and you won't regret it. 

I also love british humor  




 Would that entertain you for eternity though or would you eventually get tired of it? I remember in the movie trainspotting they described the the feeling of shooting up heroin as far better than any orgasm you will ever have. This would be the exact same thing everyday and it just makes me wonder would you eventually get bored of pure bliss? 




 I always thought if I was groundhog dayed I would try a bunch of crazy drugs I would never try otherwise. I specifically thought of H, I've dabbled in opiates, even took OCs a couple times but never tried heroin. But in your predicament, you might as well make the best of it.


There are no downsides, you can't OD, you can't build up a tolerance, no money worries, etc. So I was wondering from people who have tried this, would doing heroin all day everyday make you feel good enough that you wouldn't mind being stuck in one day over and over again for an unimaginable amount of time? I think the writers of groundhog day said Bill Murray spent about 9000 years in his day. 


Of course psychedelics would be really fucking interesting too and many other drugs would be a lot of fun but I have a feeling that it'd be kinda hard to find those in Puxatony.

 I'll do my best to explain a 4D cube(hypercube). First we'll relate the 2nd and 3rd dimensions because it is much easier to comprehend. We begin with a 2D square, this is simple enough it exists in only the x and y planes. To get a 3D cube from a square, we draw another square with the same x and y coordinates but change the z coordinate. Now you have two squares, one above the other, and you can simply connect all the vertices to form a cube.

A cube exists in the x, y and z planes which intersect at 90 degree angles with each other. To get to the fourth dimension we need to add another plane which still intersects with the x, y and z plane at a 90 degree angle. I personally can't imagine what this looks like, I'm not sure if it's even possible for us to comprehend it, but mathematically it is possible. Lets call this fourth dimension w for simplicity's sake. A hypercube is simply two cubes with the same x, y and z coordinates, separated in the w direction, and connected at the vertices. Mathematically simple to describe, but a bitch to imagine.  




 I think common sense predicts that 




 It would probably be well before that actually... 




 DUH 




 Yeah I've thought about what a 4D object would be like quite a bit. The 4th dimension would be a direction that is perpendicular to the up and down, left and right, and away and towards directions(x, y, and z). A 4D creature observing us would be able to see all sides of us along with everything inside of us all at once. 

If, say a 4D sphere were to pass through our world, to us it would look like a small sphere that appears out of nowhere and could even hang in midair, gradually gets bigger until it reaches a maximum size and then shrinks and disappears. The easiest way I've found to even kind of understand is to imagine us observing/interacting with a 2D world and kind extrapolate what it would be like to the interactions between a 4D world and a 3D world. 

Carl Sagan has a great video I'm sure you can find on youtube where he explains the 4th dimensions with the poetic yet scientific style he was famous for.  




 I always thought those were called hyper-cubes... but yeah thats four spacial dimensions. I have no idea what the fuck three time demensions would be like.

One spacial dimension is easy enough to imagine however but it's hard to even think of time as a dimension, how the hell can you have 3D time? Such a mind fuck  




 Here's what NASA has to say about it. Still not much explaination though

http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/about/information/science_faq.html#36 




 One of the reasons I posted this is I was hoping someone could explain it. Although I doubt it's possible for our brains to comprehend three time dimensions, it's hard enough trying to imagine a fourth spacial dimension. 




 Yeah I know right, I definitely can comprehend this it's so simple and intuitive!

 One good topic is how good at parallel parking I am. Always a great conversation starter 




 I'm about to be 23 years old and I've been depressed since about 14 or 15. At first I really had no reason to be depressed, I had a good group of friends, was part of the "popular" crowd, like that matters. I think what really kicked it off for me was getting pretty bad acne for most of high school. It hurt my self esteem and I don't think I've ever really recovered.

I am seeing a psychiatrist and am on lexapro and klonopin for anxiety. The depression is really just killing my work ethic which mean I'm struggling in school and lately I feel I've been even withdrawing from my friends here in college. I dread being awake and sleep way too much. Here is a little something I wrote while I was feeling really bad that I think outlines how I feel every day.



Suddenly, unexpectedly consciousness returned with a forceful jolt. Whatever he was dreaming, it was long gone to him now, it shattered like a glass dropping from a great height. He could feel a cold sweat encasing his body and threw off the blankets. It all quickly came back to him and, just like every morning, he wished it hadnt. The inanity, the despondence, the overwhelming feeling of dread accompanying each day, he could not imagine life without it. His only solace was that he could feel himself becoming more and more numb to it each morning. Maybe someday he would wake up and it wouldnt bother him anymore, maybe someday this would become normal for him, but today was not that day.

I was just wondering if you could give me any advice on how to get out of this tailspin. The only time I'm happy is when I am seeing a girl and I have been broken up with twice probably due to my depression. I just want to feel motivated and normal again.

No idea why I like it and it disgusts me in real life or if its real but I guess it's the whole domination/power thing. When im having sex with I'll get into dirty talk a bit like "you've been such a naughty girl" etc... Wow that sounds fucking lame typed out but I think the whole exchange is fairly normal. I may be just jaded by porn so someone please let me know if this is odd or I am fucked up freak.

 I agree the fact that he grouped both acid and ecstasy with meth just makes absolutely no sense... I probably thought similarly when I was like 16 but that was 7 years and a few trips ago.

Don't get me wrong they're not healthy for you by any means, ecstasy more so than acid, but they're definitely not meth. 




 Sounds like you really don't know much about drugs at all. Anyone who has any sense would tell you coke is a much worse drug than acid... care to explain your reasoning? 




 I agree about time for me to take off if you know what I mean ;)

 Get better friends 




 Congratulations! I can't really relate, I've been blessed with a really fast metabolism but I'm sure that will slow down as I get older(only 22 now). 

Right now, I can basically eat anything I want, be completely sedentary and not gain any weight whatsoever. Add the fact that unless I'm eating one of the few foods I absolutely love, I see eating more as an inconvenience than anything and you get my 6' 135 lbs self. 

Opposite ends of the spectrum I guess, I can definitely feel the physical effects of being slightly underweight but I still consider myself very lucky.

PS you speak English better than half of the native speakers here.
 









 Well yeah, I wouldn't say it to someone I just met or am just acquaintances with but with my girlfriend or other girls I'm decent friends with I am sure I'm not offending anyone. Maybe it's just my personality but it's very obvious I'm joking as I'm usually a very nice and pleasant person.

Also it's not like I do this all the time or even very often at all. 




 Have you ever posted anything that wasn't a personal attack or racial/sexual slur? Why the fuck would you keep posting with -785 karma? People here seem to despise you.... for good reason too. You have no room to comment on the content of anyone else's posts. 

Keep up the good work

 Are you are jumping to conclusions like that dude from office space. I take responsibility for my actions as you can see in this thread but fuck you 




 Yep this was a huge wake up call for me why are fucking biological urges to reproduce so strong it's not fair 
























 I'm wondering if this type of movement would be applicable to improve all-terrain vehicles, maybe something kind of like that robotic pack mule. Probably not because of the whole volume to surface area ratio thing. Even if it was, I'm sure this would have been at least considered in the engineering process of the robot mule. 




 Well he also started drinking so heavily after Watergate that his staff actually had to take the nuclear codes away from him.

He was a pretty shitty guy in all reality and might have started a nuclear war if he had been able to.

 If I could actually write, I would have had the character turn to run and see another one in that direction. Turn a different direction, same thing.  




 Hahah I'm sorry but I had to edit that. I kind of feel bad because it was almost too perfect of a typo but that's just too embarrassing. 




 I know, right? Imagine walking through somewhere like the woods or a poorly lit park at night and seeing something weird out of the corner of your eye. You look and its one of those things just standing in the distance. After a moment or two it starts slowly walking toward you. As it gets closer you begin to notice there are others surrounding you doing the same thing and there's no where to run, no way to get away.

I wish I could actually write well because I feel like this would be scary as shit, but I'm just a lowly engineer.

Edit: I wish I could put into words the scenario I'm imagining, creative writing is fucking harder than I thought. If someone wants to actually make this into a well written scary story go for it.
 




 I don't remember learning about anyone other than Einstein and Bohr throughout any of my schooling up until college/ 




 Ah, welp looking back on what I wrote he's right. I had to pull an allnighter last night getting ready for a couple exams I've got on Monday so I'm not exactly the most coherent person right now and those study aids make me ramble like a mad man too. 




 This is going to sound really condescending but I don't understand why stuff like this is a big deal and gets so many up votes just because someone is wearing something related to reddit. If I saw something like this I would probably think "oh cool he must really like Reddit" and go on my way.

 Reddit is one of the biggest if not the biggest social media aggregate sites on the internet.
 It's not like it's some like super secret esoteric club, I'm 24 and almost every single one of my friends goes on Reddit at least occasionally. I just feel like sometimes people have this idea that it's a close knit community and you're automatically going to be great friends with someone just because they are a redditor too and I just don't think that's the case. 
But hey, I guess Karma is pretty cool. 




 What are you talking about? I'm talking about the 2chan denko thread, which is what the 2 comments above mine were referencing. If you haven't read it, you should do it, it's possibly the most cringy thing on the internet 




 After reading that, I can't help but feel a little sorry for the denko guy he was just naive, a bit off his rocker and incredibly socially maladjusted(not that that excuses any of his behavior). Her shitty friend on the other hand, was the true villain who knew exactly what she was doing, what a sociopath.  




 Honestly, whenever something like this happens I just type the acronym into google and the meaning of the it pops right up at the top.

 Any idea how big the DC metro area is compared to say, the Atlanta metro area? How long does it take to drive to DC from NOVA?

Also I've always heard DC is the one of the most dangerous cities in the US? Any idea how it compares to say Atlanta? In case you can't tell I live in ATL so I'm just trying to get a reference 




 You're a true hero... Is this all in Austin?

 Here's a video of the paint being added http://vimeo.com/45021408 




 I would think  it's possible that dogs are innately able to recognize some human aspects better than animals because of the thousands of years of selective breeding. It would be interesting to take at look at the difference of response in wild dogs.

The way dogs naturally communicate puts a lot of emphasis on the tone of the barks and other vocalizations so I would think they would have some response. My guess is the wouldn't understand what is trying to be conveyed as well because they don't understand what different tones signify for humans. 




 No... pitch has nothing to do with volume, it is how deep or high pitched your voice is. It's kind of hard to define tone now that I think about it, I guess it's the way you say things so I guess tone depends on your cadence. 




 I like HotWheelz personally 




 Yes but .001 is not equal to .001%. .001 is equivalent to .1%. If you were trying to get 1% of something you would multiply that something by .01. 5% you multiply by .05. 90% you multiply by .9.

I know how to do basic math maybe you should take a second to actually read what I'm saying 




 That's .1%! To get 1% of something you multiply by .01 not 1 




 This is wrong... just because a pattern is random and non-repeating doesn't mean it contains everything...  




 Actually .001% of 7 billion is 70000 




 What are you talking about 




 I was just talking about this particular reference to Gloria 




 It's from the show Modern Family 




 I had a friend in college who completely went off the deep end. Gradually over the course of a couple weeks he got farther and farther removed from reality. He bought his close friends all kind of gifts that there was no way he could afford, completely destroyed his apartment, writing all over the walls and trashing it, and was convinced people we after him. He even thought at one point he had created a light saber and the FBI had broken into his house and stole it. He moved out of his apartment and began living on a volleyball court behind our fraternity house(he was a brother too) in a tent. This all climaxed when he took off all his clothes and started walking around the house naked with a knife in his hands. Scary stuff, the mind is a delicate thing. 




 Some people equate legality with safety. They think oh if it's legal it must be safer than actual weed when the reality is very much the opposite.

 My direction in life is not too bad. I'm taking a semester off now but will graduate in the fall with a masters in biomedical engineering. I have severe anxiety and have don't really have any friends back home which is where I am now. I'm a bit social inept and a lot of times I have trouble holding conversions especially which people I don't know. It's hard to find hobbies because everything I once enjoyed doesnt seem interesting due to the depression. I am trying to work my way out of this, have been on anti depressant for 5 years but the only thing that makes me actually be able to enjoy life is opiates and obviously thats not an option.

Something is just wrong with my brain chemistry I think. Even back in the when my first hook up was with the girl who ended up prom queen I still thought about suicide alll the time 




 After being incredibly depressed over half my 23 year old life, it makes me jealous as fuck 




 I'm the same way. I couldn't stand to think how my family would react. I don't want to die so much as just never have existed in the first place. I guess being chronically depressed for over half my life will do that to you

 Yeah that's actually what I meant to include as a counter to his point but I just now realized what I posted actually seems like evidence of his point, time to edit 




  A "prisoner" begged to leave and Zimbardo allegedly "encouraged" him to stay to the extent that the prisoner returned to the other prisoners, telling them that, "we aren't allowed to leave". There were also other instances where people were kept against their will and not because of social embarrassment.

From http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1pt80c/psychological_experiments_gone_horribly_wrong/cd5w6k7

It seems he "encouraged" participants to stay but did not say you're allowed to leave. According to a reply to this post a couple student actually did leave the study.
 




 I was born in Poughkeepsie. Glad to know my hometown is keeping up the good work 




 I remember seeing this book sitting on the coffee table at home and seeing the cover. A little bit of me died that day, life was never the same and it definitely didn't help my fear of the dark, although I was more scared of being abducted by aliens than anything else.

I was a strange child. That alien phobia never quite went completely away and I've told friends about it recently. If they ever play a practical joke on me involving aliens I honestly would freak the fuck out. Especially if it was anything like this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hl8lnZjMcos

Life is cute, but you are cuter. 

Mount my pecker, purple daughter

I'm pretty good at skill shots and most times I'll just throw them where I think the enemy will be. I'm sure a lot of variables contribute to where I place them but aiming the shot happens so fast I could never really explain my thought process, only that I felt the player would move there so I aimed there. I wonder if it's the same type of deal.

 I go to school at Georgia Tech, but I'm from Texas and honestly Atlanta is still worse in terms of racism. I think it has something to do with the large black population of the city, especially in the areas around campus which are significantly worse off. I think it has a lot more to do with socioeconomic status than race but around here black and poor really do seem to go hand in hand and this stereotype is often re-enforced. 




 Looks like its going down down in an earlier round

 Yeah considering drug legalization doesnt effect addiction rates [^1](http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/europe/120718/drug-decriminalization-portugal-addicts), it is much better for people to get unregulated black market drugs than regulated, pure drugs which they would be using anyways.  




 For me a bad trip on acid(never had a bad one on shrooms) is kind of like taking the anxiety and uncomfortable feeling I get when I'm too high or in the wrong environment and multiplying it by 10. I've tripped probably at least 40 times, the last time over a year ago. That was such a bad trip I had to leave my friends because I was paranoid and was at the point where my mind was racing too fast to even be able to form coherent sentences. By the time I wanted to say something, my mind was already somewhere else so anything I said would have be incoherent babble.

I've also convinced myself I was crazy a couple times and that this time I had taken it too far, taken too much acid and I was never gonna come back down. Those trips sucked a lot but a good trip on acid is equally as mind blowing, in an opposite, amazing way.

TLDR: Acid is a hell of a drug  




 Admittedly, I do not know much about linguistics but languages fascinate me. Years ago, when I was in high school I remember browsing the wordreference forums where a similar question was asked and there were some languages with properties that astounded me.

I can't contribute, studying languages unfortunately took a back seat to engineering for me after high school but I figured this would be the best place to ask. 

I may xPost to askReddit if this gets enough interest.

Just have to point that out considering you did it five times 




 Here ya go 
 Because the liberal left has convinced everyone that McCarthy was as bad as Hitler. The dude was pretty much right, and the rise of state-owned assets and banking which is a component of socialist thinking is what led to the crisis we're in right now. Most Americans, and redditors for that matter, can't accept that voting people in to spend other people's money regardless of whether or not they deserve that money could lead to a shortage of that money and a resistance to hiring to spend that money.

 I was at Bonnaroo one year when he was headlining the last day(think it was 2011?) which means he was the only show at the time at a festival of 100,000+ people. So, a fucking huge crowd to say the least and one of my favorites shows I've ever seen but what really stood out to me was there was a girl in the very front row with a shirt that said "It's my birthday today!!!". He proceeded to call he up on stage in between songs and get the entire crowd(at least 80,000 people) to sing her happy birthday. He has always seemed like the most down to earth celebrity and that just cemented it for me. 




 If you get this up in arms about bow hunting you need a reality check... Nature is fucked up, humans are fucked up and neither you or anyone else are ever gonna change that. Hope self perceived moral superiority makes you happy 




 I understand the dislike of people killing for fun with guns but for food with bows and arrows? Like people did for hundreds of thousands of years? The kind of killing that is constantly happening in nature? Granted it's with simple tools, but that's kinda our equivalent to a bear's claws and strength.

 My fraternity house is literally a minute walk away from the stadium for Georgia Tech in Atlanta and a ton of people would drive by it to park on gameday. We would stand out in the road(not blocking traffic obviously) with a beer and a sign saying you honk we drink and basically every car that went by would honk. Whenever cops would roll by all the time and do their little *woop woop* siren and we would finish the can. It was awesome.

 Pulling the old Sir John A. Macdonald, only Canadian Prime Minister to win six majority governments.

  One famous story is that during an election debate Macdonald was so drunk he began vomiting violently on stage while his opponent was speaking. Picking himself up Macdonald told the crowd, "see how my opponent's ideas disgust me."

In another version of the story, he responded to his opponent's query of his drunkenness with "It goes to show that I would rather have a drunk Conservative than a sober Liberal.". 




 You're correct, thank you. I believe everyone should unequivocally be treated with respect unless they do something making them lose it. I am just curious but you're right there really is no way to explain the whole gender spectrum, it just is. 




 Go the fuck away 




 I've never understood the term gender fluid. I 100% believe that due to brain chemistry, hormones, etc. some people who were born one sex feel like the other. I'm not saying I don't believe that people are actually gender fluid and feel like different sexes at different times, I just don't understand at all what would cause this. 




 I want the world to know 




 Not even just his stuff haha... OP got my car stolen by leaving my keys in my unlocked car. 




 Remeber that time you got my car stolen? None of this surprises me at all 




 I'm pretty sure what he was thinking about, something to do with a copious amount of drugs. 

This is the same kid that got my car stolen by leaving my keys in my unlocked car outside a party in a sketchy area. Luckily I found my car at 7AM next morning parked just around the corner from where I had parked it. The keys were sitting **on my hood** in plain view so I guess someone had a fun joyride in it. Somehow he always gets super luckily with the dumb shit he does. 




 I'm just guessing here but I bet the reasoning is to try to prove they're an "alpha" male not a push-over pussy "beta". Combine that with the severe social ineptitude that these people are bound to have and you get this creepy, disturbing shit. 




 I ashamed to even be able to answer this but its called "negging" and it is the dumbest thing ever, especially for the type of severely socially inept people that the PUA "technique" appeals to. 




 Don't forget about /r/AnimalPorn ,  all the badass animals of the world together in a sub!

 No he sensationalized it pretty heavily. I can't see anything constructive about adding 2 base pairs to DNA, when life seems to do fine with just 4. Maybe it will give us more choices with amino acids, etc. but considering we can't even really design our own proteins now due to post-translation modifications and not understanding folding and a whole number of other issues.

This is pretty cool I guess but nothing super ground breaking and I believe it implies that we are close to things like designing our own proteins that nature could never design when in actuality we are pretty far away. It also really doesn't seem like this author understands the whole transcription and translation process and how this applies to building proteins

BTW fuck you ryan 




 Rob Ford for President 2016. fuck the constitution we need him here in the states 




 So we should just disregard 90% of the community because of your opinion? 




 But it does bring a group of similar minded people together. I am subscribed to /r/drugs but I never really post there. I will admit sometimes the posts get me cravings to do those drugs but it has not increased my overall drug use at all and is a very knowledgeable and for the most part level-headed community. 




 I always thought brilliant writers hold most of the cards compared to publishers, especially if they're as established as Fitzgerald(I'm not sure if he was at the time though I guess). I would think he could put whatever he wants in his book but I guess that's not true.  




 Oh wow yeah! Ba$h was the shit. I remember i would go to his arena(?go bash) and fuck around with him because you had like unlimited repels and thor's and boosts and all the values for the ships were messed around with. It was a lot of fun 




 For some reason the only name I can remember from back then is Callidus. NO idea why that stuck with me. 




 So I guess I got butthole gainz wasted last night haha? Don't really remember writing any of this 




 I can't remember.. can't even remember what squad I was in but it wasn't like a top tier one, maybe second tier squad. 

I played dep all the time and could break some ankles as scout too. This is annoying me that I can't think of what my name was but I'm sure it was really dumb, I was 12. 




 So it's a 2d game where you control various types of ships using only the key board. Tab is shoot rockets, ctrl is bullets. It's basically like that old school asteroids game where you except multiplayer with 8 different types of ships, objectives(CTF, king of the hill, etc.) and ton of different weapons. The objectives on the maps are super fun, the game has a great community and it's really easy to pick up but hard to master. It's definitely worth the 5 minutes it takes to install it and try it out.


 




 Come play. It literally takes 5 mins to dl and install and I'm getting a nostalgia overload. It would also be nice to have a few more people playing. 




 Fuck that hell no. Moistening is the most female thing I could possibly think of, you gotta do it bareback and dry as the Sahara

You could probablu try to email someone from that thread and ask.

 The trick is to start shitting a couple times a day for a couple of days. This should be more than you usually do and you may need supplements to reach your shit quota. This is rip your butthole to shread. Now comes the hard part. For the next 2 weeks you are allowed one shit a week. This allows the tissue to heal. After these 3 weeks you will notice some sick gains in your butthole strength. Feel free to post pictures of your technique and I'll take a look at em ;)

 I changed it! sorry about that it was the first one that popped up on google and it seemed legit. 




 I'm not sure but I changed it to a different website that has brrn updated more recently just in case 




 Probably around 02-04. I cant remember my name for the life of me or what guild or whatever it was called i was in. I used to be really good at dep and scout 




 Yep I'm currently on trench wars getting absolutely massacred  




 I don't remember what my username was but I do remember callidus was fucking amazing and I would always dep for her. Miss playing soldier too, and the #2 scout damn good days 




 Sounds like that might have been Trench Wars. People still play, there's usually 60-100 people on and peak times.

Edit: actualy 158 on right now on that server 




 That's the only server I played for the two years I really played continuum and I just liked it a lot better than Trench Wars or Extreme Game. Maybe I don't know the nuances of those servers well enough but I long to play some metal gear. Does anyone else feel similar? 




 I know it's awesome. I should have described it more when i made the post but I was too lazy. What servers did you play on? I played Metal Gear CTF 




 What server? I played metal gear CTF and its so much different I still haven't quite figured out trench wars and that other big server, extreme games maybe? 




 I have a script for xanax... after all the opiates I've done, benzo's dont really give me much euphoria, a little, but not a lot. 




 Is it bad that that movie made me want to swindle and manipulate the shit out of people and fuck them over completely in the process so I could get that kind of life and do that many drugs and fuck so many dimes. 




 Dude it was all about metal gear. I loved that server. It's not up anymore though =( 




 Oh.. I guess I'm more of a TagAmateur than a Tag pro. I'm only like 15 degrees 




 And be sure to inject butter directly into your blood stream every 4 hours to alleviate the debilitating emotional pain 




 Do you think you're better than me? You're a pussy with your pristine asshole than isn't so covered with scar tissue that you can poop in under 2 hours. I laugh at you before you laugh at me 




 I would periodically move things around their desk around while they are focused on something else. Maybe move a notebook from a drawer onto the desk. Maybe move a pen they just had in their hand onto the other side of the desk. Things that would be physically impossible to happen. This would be very subtle, maybe once or twice a month at most. Gradually I'd start doing more obvious things, like unplugging their monitor or making a stapler fall off their desk for no reason. 

Maybe after 6 months of this, I would start writing messages to them, either using a pen and one of their notbooks that is out of sight, or distracting them enough to write something like **LEAVE THIS PLACE** OR **WAKE UP** on their computer. Maybe I would do this with notes or if they are working on something in word, just type it in the middle of their document. Eventually they would begin to doubt their sanity. As they neared the breaking point, if I sensed they we're going ot loose it soon, I would draw dickbutt in paint and tile it as their background. I would then write "turn around" and have a couple hundred thousands dollars in my hand(which I had stolen using telekinesis) and give it to them to maybe make up for the torture. 




 Do you want me to sit in a corner and rust or just fall apart where I'm standing?  




 I'm currently toughing my asshole up. I started with singly ply and then I found half ply, next the finest grain sand paper available. I gradually increased the grain fineness over the course of the past two years and now I use steel wool and I feel manly as fuck. 

It's like that ass pennies sketch. If i ever am uncomfortable around someone I just think their candy ass can't wipe with steel wool, they don't deserve to be in my presence.
 




 Well I(along with many many other people I assume) am a completely different person on the internet than I am in real life. I would never even think about saying anything like that to anyone I know. It's kind of like how you change how you act, even if only a little, depending on the people you're around 




 COuld I be your unlikely morbid, depressed and callous robot penguin sidekick. 




 Or you could just spend a dollar or 2 extra to avoid the butthole pillaging altogether.  




 For each their own... anonymity breeds weirdness 




 [Continuum](http://www.subspace.co/). Archaic game the is incredibly addicting and fun

Edit: Wish I had put more effort into this post, I feel like it could be much higher up 




 I seriously think they should make a tagpro type game with a 3d engine. Maybe something a little like LoL, you would have skills(like jukes or spins or sprint) which would be on a cool down. Maybe even different classes(scout, defender, etc.) too but you would move with WASD.

Edit: Just to clarify how I'm picturing it: It would still be CTF. The only way to die would still be running into each other, or maybe some type of special move. Maybe there would be some projectile type attacks you could aim with the arrow keys, but of coursee they would have cooldowns.

Can anyone elaborate on why this would be a bad idea. I don't care of downvotes I'm just curious
  




 To be honestly I was just trying to type the weirdest possible thing I could ala /u/mroglolblo or /u/_vargas_. Just wanted to try it out, had never done it before

If you want to read some stories kinda like that except a millions times better go through mrog's history

Here's a preview
I wouldn't want to have sex with the queen but it could be kind of hot if she watched. She has always seemed like she has a "wry" sense of humor and has always struck me as a woman of intense curiosity. How cool would it be to bring a chick back to your place and she sees the queen sitting in a chair in the corner as you frantically undress each other and she stops and says "oh gosh, it's you!" "It is an honor your majesty!" and she awkwardly curtsies while covering her tits with one hand, "charmed my dear, now start fucking!" At first she is really demure and tries to be as tender and "proper" as possible, missionary only etc. and the queen starts shrieking "none of that, when I said start fucking, I meant start FUCKING!!!" and maintains steely eye contact with her 




 So OP's picture is literally the first one to come up for chinese english tattoo on google image. [Here's the second](http://i.imgur.com/hRGQoJh.jpg) 




 Plot Twist: His boss is a transvestite and he caught her right after she had finished jackin it. 




 I mean what I wrote is just as plausible as the OP's story honestly. 




 Only thing left to do is post this picture of an intimate situation between two people publicly for literally everyone I even kind of know can see it. 




 That's when you say oh here let me wipe that off for you and pull out your rock hard dick and ever so tenderly get every drop on the tip of your dick. 

The moment is finally here! That skill you've been practicing for months, that you've put your life and soul in, it's moment has arrived. You lie down and prepare. Pushing your dick down as far as it will go you steady yourself. Using the cock pushup acquired dick strength, you let her rip. The the cum is shot in a perfect arc right into your own open mouth. A flawless dick catapult. The man juice in your mouth tastes better than ever before, you literally have an orgasm in your mouth.

 Don't forget to run it under some warm Code Red first. 




 Wish the same thing could have been said about his pituitary gland :(. He was such an amazing person 




 Aw. Guess just exorbitant amounts of coke will have to fill the void. 




 I don't know if I could handle those Zefs there though(unless they look like Yolandi). Are they like the SA version of chavs? 




 The name roach is very fitting for them 




 Does this imply most of his novels underwent similar censorship? 




 You forgot the type a horrible comment step somewhere before exit out. 




 Watching that movie makes me want to do so many drugs. Does anyone know if ludes were actually as awesome as they make them out to be? 




 For snorting coke, I'd say the norm is 20-40 mins between lines depending on how much you have 




 Can you provide proof for any of this? The majority of other posts in this thread seem to say the exact opposite. 




 I envy you as well. I've got a 5 hours left till my engineering degree and my recent lack of a social life has kind of left me unmotivated to put my all into school. I am on medication of depression and anxiety but I feel some kind of therapy would help but so far the 2 therapists I've seen haven't really helped. 




 For some reason I read that as conversation... I'm a pretty quite guy and sometimes have trouble holding conversations with 
people I don't know well and was just seeing if maybe that type of therapy would help me but I guess some other type of therapy would be much better
 




 7What about the amazonian(I think) fish thing that swims up your urethra when you pee and lodges itself in there.  




 Can I ask what you symptoms you were treated for. 




 It seems to be it's just a bit more specific than his earlier claim and meant to clarify. 




 Of course inflation has a bit to do with it as well. 




 Who cares? Your'e a fucking dick 




 I know right. I speak a little German so I understood maybe like half of it but it was like a really weird mix of german and english 




 Don't forget about your duderuses either. 




 Do you mean alprazolam? Altrazaplan isn't anything
 




 Yep, I remember reading in biochem that the best internal combustion engine is only around 30-40% efficient in harnessing the energy produced by breaking C-H bonds, while our bodies are 60-70% efficient. 




 What? That's crazy I live in Texas and it's only around $3.30-$3.50 




 I found [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/23dyes/recap_the_failed_moderation_and_gaming_of/cgyf5y4) a little while ago... Take it with a grain of salt obviously
 




 Ah I see, didn't catch that 




 I've tripped more times than I can count and I was want to say you have a really good idea of what it's like for someone who hasn't done it. I would definitely recommend trying it at least once, but only in the right environment. It's really just gives you a whole new perspective on things and is quite interesting. 




 It's still on? I thought it got canceled cause I've only seen a few episodes. 




 Thank you that's really interesting and I would never notice anything like that. I also appreciate you being so civil cause I honestly don't understand why this question got so much hate. 




 I never said she looked better with no make up on.. I meant this style of make up. Maybe I didn't word it quite right but this is just ridiculous. I asked a legitimate question I was curious about Sorry for trying to expand my horizons a bit 




 Haha I'm suprised anyone understood that at all... so many typos damn swype 




 I think we're not on the same page. I was talking more about the neuroscience part like /u/mroxiful  




 Yes 3 legs on the ground at all times makes walking very simple but what about for walking over things? What about getting away from predators? Etc. Is it the most efficient for all these factors which highly influence the life and death of the insect and in turn the strength of the colony.
 




 Same. I'm done wasting my time arguing about it, what a waste of 45 minutes. 




 Thanks, I didn't know about the earlier models but it makes perfect sense. 




 I guess /r/science spoils me in this regard 




 Maybe it is that simple, but I'm sure there are other factors at play. Yes 3 legs on the ground at all times is great but what about for walking over things? What about getting away from predators? Etc. Is it the most efficient for all these factors which highly influence the life and death of the insect and in turn the strength of the colony. 

It obviously is because insects have 6 legs but what I'm trying to say it's not just basic geometry by any means. 

Source: Many classes from my biomedical engineering degree and a little bit of critical thinking 




 Maybe it is that simple, but I'm sure there are other factors at play. Yes 3 legs on the ground at all times is great but what about for walking over things? What about getting away from predators? Etc. Is it the most efficient for all these factors?  




 Exactly! Many cases.. not all. 




 Maybe he did and couldn't find anything so he decided to ask the person who was making the claim. I'm willing to bet that's the case actually.

Any critical thinking, scientifically literate person would do the same thing. 




 I think you are probably right but just because it seems to make sense doesn't mean it's necessarily true, and if it is true it shouldn't be too hard to do a google or google scholar search to provide a source and remove all doubt 




 I can and I'm sure he can too, but just because it seems to make sense doesn't mean it's true by any means.  




 It makes me sad that some people so blindly believe things that they would condescendingly question why you don't. 




 Do you have any idea what that robotic pack mule was 4 legged and modeled after mammals, than after something like this. Maybe the who size difference and surface area to volume ratio thing? 
























 Either that or the admins are stepping in... 




 I agree that would be great but I feel police today have a vested interested in keeping their current focus. I don't know if changing their focus would be possible without a lot of resistance from current police departments. 




 But changing what we call officers would have no effect at all on their actions and priorities. 




 I'm guessing this was somewhere in Williamson county? 




 Or add some salt 




 Yeah I guess I didn't make it clear but I actually have watched all of season 2-7 and for the most part it was fucking great. Just finished "All good things..." like 2 days ago which was a fairly fitting end for the TV show. 




 Out of curiosity I started watching TNG at the end of season 1 right before Riker got his beard because I caught a couple episodes on BBC: America before deciding to watch the whole thing and just wanted to continue from where I'd been watching. How good is the first season? After finishing season 7 it's going to be hard to go back to the beginning and I always have qualms about the first season of shows I think because of the Simpsons season 1. 




 One of the reasons for this has been the fact that we have over the years seen an excess of young players from continents like Africa or South America, who have been sent over or brought over by clubs to take trials that haven't worked out for them. And the players just don't have the money to be able to go back to their countries.

From [this article](http://www.npr.org/2014/04/06/299708689/after-scandal-barcelona-football-club-banned-from-trades) I found when I was trying to figure out what was going on 




 "The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist."

Fuck I love Kevin Spacey too much not to include a House of Cards quote too. 

Ive always loathed the necessity of sleep. Like death, it puts even the most powerful men on their backs. 




 I would think that the less serious cases of ebola are also less likely to get hospitalized or  to report it, making the morality rate skewed higher than it actually is. Just a guess though. 




 I feel in a post-technological collapse world, unless it was caused by something which would damage electronics, microprocessors and the like would become somewhat of a mine-able or forage-able resource for a time. There would people left to with enough knowledge to build new computers from scavenged parts or maintain old computers which still function. Granted this would might only happen once basic needs such as food and survival are taken care of, but perhaps not. Computers may be a big enough boon to planning how to rebuild infrastructure, beginning from the basics of providing water and food to an area of people, that they would remain useful as long as the power needed for them could be provided, 




 Do you hear your own voice super imposed over what you are actually hearing? No the two are distinctly separate for me. I imagine it would be the same visually. I can imagine an image without it impeding my ability to see why would this be any different? 




 I'm scared hold me 




 I don't know personally I've had especially coherent insightful thoughts while tripping. One of the many things I realized from the many times I have tripped is that words are constraining. 

There weren't words for many of the sensations I felt, there was no way to describe my altered perceptions to anyone else who had never experienced it. It made me realize how truly confined  I am to my own body and words which were created, if you will, by someone who is not me. 

Stephen Colbert once said, in an interview out of character, that every person had two names. One that describes him as other people perceive him, and one totally ineffable to anyone but himself that describes who he truly is. I think that principle also applies to a persons thoughts and feelings and it takes an especially eloquent person to transcend these barriers. It made me wonder if I will ever be able to know anyone else as they truly are. 




 Just to let you know next time you need to press enter twice when you want to start new line, not once. 

Or you can put 4 spaces in front of something to make reddit display it as code Like this: 

    Syntax error
    ?
    Syntax error
    h
    Syntax error
    /h
    Syntax error 




 You are truly a great person and I wish him all the best. This has made something I or anyone I know have never experienced much more real to me.  As a recently graduated Biomedical Engineer I really hope I can contribute to improving cancer treatments at some point in my career because cancer is fucking fucked. I can't even find the words to describe my feelings towards it.  




 Haha how embarrassing 




 Haha oops I didn't watch it because I had already seen it. Thought they were different interviews 




 She said in an other interview that she tried teamspeak/vent/whatever and people recognized her voice...

Edit: I'm a dumbass and didn't watch this video before commenting because I had seen  itbefore.  




 Maybe it's just me but some unnecessary euphemisms, especially that try to downplay a particularly serious situation don't sit right with me. For example that some employees will be "more impacted" due to "company restructuring", instead of just calling it what it is, necessary company layoffs because the company has been under performing. 

This situation already sucks, no one ever wants to have to get rid of employees or be laid-off themselves but when this does happen, everyone knows what's going on. These euphemisms don't help the situation at all, you can do something like this in a respectful manner without treating adults like children who can't handle the reality of what's happening..  




 After 2 drinks a lot, if not most, men at least will have a BAC below .08. 




 What is up with this ref. The majority of the calls he has made have been wrong and have also had a game changing effect. 




 I figure incineration is pretty good at getting rid of pathogens too so I was just wondering what the point of doing both is. It seems a little redundant. Maybe it's autoclaved prior to transportation to an incinerator or something? 




 Out of curiosity what is the point of autoclaving it before incineration? Just to ensure that no pathogens are spread prior to destroying it? 




 That's really interesting, it'd be awesome if it was actually him. I wouldn't be surprised.  




 No but I also don't believe *every single* post that mentions a company in any way is definitely posted by that company as a means of cheap advertising. I'm sure it happens but I don't jump to that conclusion without evidence. Throw in the fact that OP's account is over a year old, has a decent amount of karma and does not mention this company any other time and I feel that it is a reasonable doubt. 




 Did you ask him about the details? Why did he do it? Where did he end up landing after parachuting out of the plane? How did he get from there to a town and eventually to Mexico? What did he do with all the money, why did very little of it enter circulation etc.? 




 That's really interesting. Was his story convincing enough that you actually believe it?  




 Story? 




 It will definitely be a good game. I'm hoping di Maria will be able to play, Argentina looked a little lackluster today without him. 




 I wouldn't be surprised if Neuer saves all 5 if it comes down to penalties but I would be surprised if it even comes to penalties. That's not Germany's style 




 I agree. It was the polar opposite of last game 




 Yep, penalties are kind of lame... 




 The ESPN stream can't take the pressure. Gah stop buffering! 




 I guarantee he's studied the shit out of Argentinian players and how they take penalties. I bet keeping him in was planned and he's gotten helped preparing by Krul too 




 I agree but a game like this game could easily go on for a very long time. I don't know if that's the right thing to do either. 




 Childrens hospital was filmed at the hospital afterwards but since that show changed locations in the last couple seasons it makes sense that the hospital is gone n ow 




 Yeah I agree getting hit with a shot is much much worse, goalies are a crazy, tough breed. 




 Yeah you're right, I guess it was just during practices now that I think about it. It was 6 years ago so everything is kind of blurred together at this point. It did make practicing in the 100 degree Texas heat a bit more bearable. 




 As a former college attack, it also kind of sucks to get beat on by 6' poles. 




 Definitely did they same thing playing attack except I didn't wear elbow pads at all. Getting beaten on with 6' titanium poles is a bit less intense than what goalies had to go through though. 




 They definitely do, he must have been just fucking around and not in an actual game or something. 




 Yep my highschool in Texas had enough people for 3 separate teams, JV, D2 varsity and varsity. Really fun sport I miss it a lot, especially playing attack and not have to run constantly all game. 

I don't really miss getting beaten on with 6' titanium sticks all the time though. I never wore elbow pads either and took the actual shoulder pads off my shoulder pads so they was just chest pads too. Probably wasn't the smartest thing to do. 




 I'm reading Shogun right now, actually left the last 20 pages for this evening. I've been wondering how historically accurate it is...Are you saying it's not very accurate? If you've read it

Edit: in the book the samurai, especially the lower tier ones, seem to take bushido pretty seriously but have no qualms about disregarding it when it is useful to them.  




  they weren't bound by some code of honor or anything like that

Uhh isn't that exactly what bushido is? 




 Except that's not how it works. As far as I know, the reddit fuzzing algorithm basically took the actual number of upvotes and varied it by a certain percentage. This percentage increased with the total number of votes. They then took varied the number of downvotes in the same manner so the comment's total karma was relatively close the to the actual comment score. 




 Go for it man. Maybe if you look back on these post in 5 years when you're 18 you'll realize how much of a douchebag you are but have fun until then. 




 Next time be cordial when trying to make your point. It may have been valid but berating people like that is going to nothing but make you look like a huge fucking douchebag 




 You're a braver man(woman?) than I. I didn't dare to venture into the putrid cesspool that is surely his comment history. The strange thing is he is not a negative karma troll just a angry man. I would imagine he is very socially inept if he figured that would be an effective way to make his point. 




 I didn't believe it either but a doing a quick google produced   [this](http://articles.latimes.com/2014/jan/27/world/la-fg-north-korea-meth-20140127). 




 I know right! All I did is say what everyone else is thinking, I don't think I deserve gold for it, but hey I'll take it! 




 Hey, asshole

OP is doing some genuine good in the world. Maybe the charity he chose to donate to isn't the best possible choice but that is no reason to insult him. 

Your further promotion of this radical organization will not be tolerated.

Tolerated by who? You think arrogantly think you're speaking on behalf of all of reddit. You think OP is actively promoting this organization out of malevolence and not because he is trying to help?  Fuck off 




 Germany didn't play their best but I feel Germany was by no means lethargic 




 Let's hope Mueller is ok! 




 What a great game! 




 No it's in our interest to Germany to win i believe. 




 Give that corner to Klose! 




 For once Klose off key and off target =( 




 One of the best matches so far! Since so many good games in this WC! 




 No they can't! 




 Neuer... best goalkeept in the world! 




 Oezil! Too good of a passer 




 I'm just glad it wasn't against the US 




 Me too! Germany has always been my favorite team because the US normally isn't very good. I'm so conflicted! 




 Schweinstieger scores in the 87' to win it for Germany. 




 Ahh so out of character for Lahm why that back heal? 




 If you mean a devastatingly effiecent, wurst eating, beer drinking badass then I agree 




 You guys are good! Definitely a world class team, 




 I've got a raging efficient German boner too! 




 This world cup is fucking awesome. 




 If Ghana wins 3 teams have 3 points. It means we have to beat Portugal to have a advance. Otherwise if Germany wins we are in I believe 




 By scoring a goal! That's how 




 That frontflip! 




 Klose! 




 It seems like they have potential to go far in this tournament 




 Get your shit together Germany. Deutschland ueber alles(ausser USA) 




 Most upsets in the world cup group stage ever? I'm not losing hope, Deutschland ueber alles(ausser USA)! 




 I know right. Wtf! 




 Hope he's in good enough form! 




 Warum spielt Schweinsteigter heute nicht? Ist er zu alt geworden? Bitte antworte mir auf English mein Deutsch ist Scheisse ich habe Deutsch nut seit zwei jahren studiert(If you can't tell already lol) 




 I swear that just looks like a blink not a wink. Am I seeing things?

Edit: One more question for an ignorant American, why is Schweinsteiger not in? Is he out of form? He's my favorite player 




 Yeah and my retarded post was definitely 100% serious  




 As much as I hate this reddit cliche very relevant username. Mr. Broken leg's is too, the seven at the end obiously refers to his age 




 Unfortunately that makes a lot of sense. Thanks, hope I helped you feel a bit more productive today. Good luck on the BAR! A shot in the dark but I'm guessing from your username you're at VT law or did undergrad there? 




 I'm not sure if you would know this but would her sentence in the US would have been much harsher? Let's say she was charged with battery, reckless endangerment, hit and run and hopefully a couple other charges the prosecution could have added on(criminal negligence?) 




 I found some stuff I've already posted multiple times but /u/TheMSensation is the better internet detective as you can see above 




 Not even close! She should have gotten attempted vehicular manslaughter but I'm pretty sure that's not a real crime. Maybe assault with a deadly weapon? 




 Apparently the video poster commented "she got away lightly with a 2 year suspended, 200 hours community service, 2 year ban and had to pay the victim 500 compensation". 




 The man suffered a broken leg and  she got away lightly with a 2 year suspended, 200 hours community service, 2 year ban and had to pay the victim 500 compensation according to the video poster 




 Haha you beat me finding it by 1 minute! I found the video OP's comment "she got away lightly with a 2 year suspended, 200 hours community service, 2 year ban and had to pay the victim 500 compensation"  




 So the original video poster ended up saying this "she got away lightly with a 2 year suspended, 200 hours community service, 2 year ban and had to pay the victim 500 compensation"  




 Not only that she deserves to lose her freedom for a couple years at least. Hope she got charged with attempted vehicular manslaughter or something like that. 




 To my American ears that sounded pretty tame but I'm sure its not. Would that be the British equivalent to fuck your work you fucking piece of shit?   




 I really want to figure out what happened to that piece of shit. I hope someone finds a follow up article or something that states her punishment 




 That was definitely my favorite post I read that entire day. You brightened my and I'm sure any others day, rolled with the punches so people were laughing with you not at you and I guarantee everyone in your workplace knows you now. This could have happened to anyone. People know that and this will open up more doors than it closes.  




 Are you by chance related to DICK PLACE? 




 You are a dick. 




 First 32 seconds and last 10 minutes! I'll take it 




 It was really good! Definitely better than a lot of TV shows on the air today. I could see this being a sketch on WKUK or something along those lines 




 Here's a big more context for anyone who hasn't had a chance to google the first quote yet.

UN Chief Weapons Inspector Hans Blix, revealed in an interview in 2003 that Vice-President Dick Cheney said to him we will not hesitate to discredit you in favour of disarmament. In other words, tell us there are WMDs or we will claim youre incompetent and go to war anyway. 




 That's exactly how I feel about fringe. 




 They could probably even use my high school stadium! 




 Honestly I had to try pretty hard to come up with someway to disagree with you but I felt it was necessary 




 I feel like the meme format detracts from the seriousness of the situation a bit though. Maybe its just how I view memes but this post would have hit front page regardless of how it was posted and a news story would have given more context. I came into the comments to figure out who this group of people is and some more insight into what exactly this petition is for. I haven't really found anything except shitty jokes and this loser I went to high school with but I guess that's reddit for you. 

Fuck you ryan 




 Tiger got to hunt, bird got to fly;

Man got to sit and wonder 'why, why, why?'

Tiger got to sleep, bird got to land;

Man got to tell himself he understand. 




 My high school offered basically all AP classes and I took everyone I could except for US and World history. I also got credit for every test I took and even passed an addition AP test for a class I never took. I ended up coming into college with 28 hours although I think some of my AP credits didn't count toward my major and weren't part of that 28. I was just shy of the 32 hours required to be considered a sophomore 



Also, a lot of colleges limit the amount of hours you can come in with out of high school. I didn't know you can come out of high school with an AA/AS degree but what I did was tough enough. Be careful not to push them too hard. 




 True I worded that wrong, should have said some scientists. I personally believe that we have no idea the full extent of the chain effects eliminating mosquitoes would cause or whether the good would outweigh the bad. I just wanted to point out a different perspective. 




 Mosquitoes may be one of the few organisms that we can live without, and many scientists believe that their elimination would cause no ecological harm.
