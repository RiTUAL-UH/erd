 From Wikipedia:

By 5 August the brigades of the Australian 2nd Division were exhausted and were to be relieved by the Australian 4th Division. While the relief was underway on the night of 56 August the Australians were subjected to an extreme bombardment, because the salient they occupied could be shelled by the Germans from all directions, including from Thiepval which lay to the rear. On the morning of 6 August a German counter-attack tried to approach the O.G. Lines but was met by machine gun fire and forced to dig in. The bombardment continued through the day, by the end of which most of the 2nd Division had been relieved. From its twelve days in the line, the division had suffered 6,848 casualties. At 4:00 a.m. on 7 August, shortly before dawn, the Germans launched their final counter-attack. On a front of 400 yards (370 m) they overran the thinly occupied O.G. Lines, catching most of the Australians in shelters in the old German dugouts and advanced towards Pozires. For the Australians, the crisis had arrived. At this moment, Lieutenant Albert Jacka, who had won the Victoria Cross at Gallipoli, emerged from a dugout where he and seven men of his platoon had been isolated, and charged the German line from the rear. His example inspired other Australians scattered across the plateau to join the action and a fierce, hand-to-hand fight developed. Jacka was badly wounded but as support arrived from the flanks, the Australians gained the advantage and most of the surviving Germans were captured. No more attempts to retake Pozires were made.

 Dad would never talk about the war. All he would ever say was "I did my duty". My Uncle told me about D-day. After my Dad died I found an Air Medal (with three Oak Leaves), but I have never been able to find out what he did. He never flew after the war, but worked for Lockheed for the rest of working life. Again, he was close-mouthed about work, but he was usually at a Lockheed facility in Palmdale.

There were boxes of photos from the war in the attic. Quite a few pics of paratroops loading up, long lines of C-47s.

He met my Mom in Orleans in 1944. Buts her's is another story.

In accomplishing her 100 missions Corsair 122 logged more than 400 hours flying time; her total hops, including tests and reconnaissance flights, reached an amazing 178. Built for air combat, Corsair 122 proved her versatility by accepting 1000 pound bombs slung from her belly and without strain or protest developed into the hottest dive bomber with wings. Were their blood in her fuel line instead of 100 octane she would be wearing the purple heart for the patch on the leading edge of her wing attesting of the accuracy of Jap antiaircraft fire. She has covered all the Jap bases in the Marshall Islands like the morning dew.

 Pyroclastic flows descend the south-eastern flank of Mayon Volcano, Philippines. Maximum height of the eruption column was 15 km above sea level, and volcanic ash fell within about 50 km toward the west. There were no casualties from the 1984 eruption because more than 73,000 people evacuated the danger zones as recommended by scientists of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology.

 *Hell's Angels*, Howard Hughes, 1930. Even today the air combat scenes are among the most believable (alas 3 pilots and a mechanic were killed during the production). The explosions are real, unlike the flash and noise spectacles since. And Jean Harlow uses the line "wait here while I slip into something more comfortable" (she's wearing very little to begin with) for the first time. Because it's pre Hayes the dialog gets a bit spicey.

These motorcycles were popular for their high performance. Besides being hand built, with many optional performance modifications available, they came from the factory with documented dynamometer test results, allowing the new owner to see the horsepower produced."

 Lieutenant Randall H. Cunningham and Lieutenant (junior grade) William Driscoll pictured in an F-4 Phantom II fighter. On May 10, 1972, during aerial combat over North Vietnam, the pair shot down three enemy MiG fighters before their aircraft was hit by a surface-to-air missile, forcing them to eject. These three kills, combined with two recorded previously, made them the Nay's first and only aces of the Vietnam War.

 I believe he was stationed in or around Orleans and they met at a cafe. They said very little about those times.

 Dad was just out of High School. He went to Lone Pine High School. After he graduated he helped build Manazar, where fellow Americans of Japanese descent were interned, while he waited until he was 18 to join up.

During the war there was rapid advancement  for many; I expect he was a [Direct Appointment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brevet_%28military%29#Modern_usage) (paragraph 2) 1LT. 




 The C-47 is an utterly reliable aircraft, tough and versatile. For my money the Lockheed [Constellation](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Lockheed_R7V-2_turboprop_Connie_in_flight_c1953.jpeg) wins the beauty prize, though. 




 I'm American. If my French was better I could become a citizen of France anytime. My kids would like that because then they, too, could be French citizens. It's on my to do list. 




 Dad was very bright, and there was a great need for pilots is what I presume.

Edit: He joined the Army in April, 1942 at 18. He said "We weren't a bunch of four F'ers and joined up as soon as we were old enough." 




 Dad wouldn't talk about the war. All he would say about it was "I did my duty". After he died I found an Air Medal (Bronze Star) with a couple oak leaves. No luck finding out why he got them.

After the war he and Mom lived in Germany as part of the occupation but she hated it. He would never fly again but always loved aircraft and worked for Lockheed for the rest of his career. Again, he would never say what he did and was usually out in Palmdale.

Mom would never talk about the war, either. I believe they both went through some very bad stuff. She only went back home once, 50 years later, for a visit and it was utterly foreign to her, although she was proud of being French and never became an American citizen. Her Dad didn't survive the war and my Uncle was *Maquis* and is still living in a tiny French village, at 93, outside Orleans, where my Mom was born. He helped with communications, and still has homing pigeons. 




 Yes, he and my Mom, who was French, were part of the German Occupation until 1947. 




 It's such a shame he wasn't allowed to play for a wider audience throughout his career. So many more persons would have enjoyed his amazing talents.

 The best means to screen for colon cancer is a colonoscopy. Gastroenterologists usually perform the procedure, so the availability of specialty care may be a barrier.

All persons with a first degree relative (i.e. Mom, Dad, Brothers, Sisters)  with colon cancer are at increased risk and should have a colonoscopy every five years. The procedure is done with conscious sedation; one is not unconscious, but is unaware and cannot recall the procedure if the anesthesia is done properly. The most unpleasant part of the test is drinking stuff that makes you poop until the colon is cleaned out so the colon can be visualized.

Most colon cancer starts out as a small bump called a polyp that takes many years to become an invasive cancer so there is plenty of time to find them and remove them, thus preventing cancer. 

If one is not high risk screening should start in everyone at age 50 and be repeated every 10 years

 Basilone's Medal of Honor citation reads as follows:

The President of the United States in the name of The Congress takes pride in presenting the 

MEDAL OF HONOR to
SERGEANT JOHN BASILONE UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS

for service as set forth in the following CITATION:

Medal of Honour
For extraordinary heroism and conspicuous gallantry in action against enemy Japanese forces, above and beyond the call of duty, while serving with the 1st Battalion, 7th Marines, 1st Marine Division in the Lunga Area, Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands, on 24 and 25 October 1942. While the enemy was hammering at the Marines' defensive positions, Sgt. BASILONE, in charge of 2 sections of heavy machine guns, fought valiantly to check the savage and determined assault. In a fierce frontal attack with the Japanese blasting his guns with grenades and mortar fire, one of Sgt. BASILONE'S sections, with its gun crews, was put out of action, leaving only 2 men able to carry on. Moving an extra gun into position, he placed it in action, then, under continual fire, repaired another and personally manned it, gallantly holding his line until replacements arrived. A little later, with ammunition critically low and the supply lines cut off, Sgt. BASILONE, at great risk of his life and in the face of continued enemy attack, battled his way through hostile lines with urgently needed shells for his gunners, thereby contributing in large measure to the virtual annihilation of a Japanese regiment. His great personal valor and courageous initiative were in keeping with the highest traditions of the U.S. Naval Service.

The President of the United States takes pride in presenting the NAVY CROSS posthumously to

for service as set forth in the following CITATION:

For extraordinary heroism while serving as a Leader of a Machine-Gun Section, Company C, 1st Battalion, 27th Marines, 5th Marine Division, in action against enemy Japanese forces on Iwo Jima in the Volcano Islands, 19 February 1945. Shrewdly gauging the tactical situation shortly after landing when his company's advance was held up by the concentrated fire of a heavily fortified Japanese blockhouse, Gunnery Sergeant BASILONE boldly defied the smashing bombardment of heavy caliber fire to work his way around the flank and up to a position directly on top of the blockhouse and then, attacking with grenades and demolitions, single handedly destroyed the entire hostile strong point and its defending garrison. Consistently daring and aggressive as he fought his way over the battle-torn beach and up the sloping, gun-studded terraces toward Airfield Number 1, he repeatedly exposed himself to the blasting fury of exploding shells and later in the day coolly proceeded to the aid of a friendly tank which had been trapped in an enemy mine field under intense mortar and artillery barrages, skillfully guiding the heavy vehicle over the hazardous terrain to safety, despite the overwhelming volume of hostile fire. In the forefront of the assault at all times, he pushed forward with dauntless courage and iron determination until, moving upon the edge of the airfield, he fell, instantly killed by a bursting mortar shell. Stouthearted and indomitable, Gunnery Sergeant BASILONE, by his intrepid initiative, outstanding skill, and valiant spirit of self-sacrifice in the face of the fanatic opposition, contributed materially to the advance of his company during the early critical period of the assault, and his unwavering devotion to duty throughout the bitter conflict was an inspiration to his comrades and reflects the highest credit upon Gunnery Sergeant BASILONE and the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life in the service of his country.
