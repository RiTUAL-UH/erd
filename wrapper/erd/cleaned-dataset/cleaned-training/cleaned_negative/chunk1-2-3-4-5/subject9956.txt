I tried demo and i love it, but i do not have enough money at the moment (and i am going to write an article on it when i get it). Sciency rockety stuff! I would be very grateful :) 




 I have a spare copy of this great game. Actually, it is my the most favorite game ever.
Post the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything and i will decide. 




 So, a few weeks earlier a guy stopped me near the place i go to school. It turned out the guy is a Hindu preacher, trying to sell some books about Krishna and talk people into religion.

I kinda like him, we talk for a moment every time i go that way, but he appears to be very brainwashed/clearly instructed. First, when i told him i am an atheist, he tried to tell me atheism is a religion (i told him it is in fact absence of faith). Today i told him i read The God Delusion and he went on how atheist don't know facts and write about it (i even told him Dawkins has all sourced), whereas religious books are true (particularly his own religion's one, obviously, because when i told him e.g. Bible and Quran are just books, that it is not an evidence of anything, he seemed to agree).

I am not sure if it's worth trying to learn him at least anything, I don't know if he listens. But I don't particularly like arguing with people, so i am not pushing anything.

 Hi everyone,

i do not expect to be many Czech people here, but i am going to post it anyway. With help from couple of other Czech bronies i managed to finish Czech Subtitles for the first part of [Brony Chronicles](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2EOfhvvURY feature=player_embedded).

It was difficult, but i am proud of it. I do not expect it to be well-received here, but even if one person find it useful i will be happy.
BTW yes, i already posted it on Czech forums.

It it for 720p version downloaded off YouTube.

 When my cat lies somewhere, she put her legs and tail under her so she looks like a little furry blobby bean. It's adorable.

I just wanted to share with you. 




 Say it with a picture! 




 It's old, useless and powerless, i just want to be sure it won't shock me or something. 




 After five troublesome years i can finally rest from it and study English. 




 Here is a download link to the torrent, thanks to the loyal seeders it is quite fast.

 Can i set all except characters/objects/buildings on minimum and maintain good fps? What has the biggest impact on performance?

**DEEP WEB**, not the surface one
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Web 




 We've seen it in many movies and experienced in many games - enemy/alien threat is overpowering some major USA city, in the end the military/goverment decides to send a nuclear missile in there. Could that be a real scenario and under what circumstances? 












































 Psychonauts is an older game, yet it is my THE MOST favourite game ever and i will tell you a few reasons why:

* It's very different than any other games in terms of its originality
* Art style is fantastic even with limited texture resolution and limited amount of polygons
* The game is very humorous and funny
* Each level offers its own unique gameplay 
* Game setting is quite joyful and the plot is intriguing
* It has many things to collect, which serves not only for a sole purpose of being collected, but it's important for game progress.

Albeit it's an older game, the time hasn't taken anything from its enjoyability. If you pass off on it, you will miss one of the most original games ever created. 



















 I tried to Google, but i am not much smarter. 



















 I was going there, because some awesome things there were mistaken for uncool. Have we won?

 We got NMM, Discord, Chrysalis and Sombra. We all are excited by possibility of seeing some of them again, but every season so far introduced at least one new villain. Who do you think it will be in Season 4?

 Starswirl the Bearded was a powerful magician, who lived more than 1000 years ago. He invented spell to transform a pony (unicorn or pegasus) into an alicorn. The regal sisters used this spell to become alicorns and thus defeat Discord (and then Sombra). They kept the book for themselves and Celestia is testing her pupils (many generations of them). If they prove themselves to be worthy enough, Celestia reward them with turning them to alicorns. 












































 There is Derpy trying to open cookie jar with her hooves without succes, cursing "What kind of sadistic retard invented this crap?!. In the next panel is Celestia opening the cookie jar with her magic and she says something like "Hohoho". (i love her expression while she's doing so, that's why i am looking for it) 










































































 Today i found quite shocking (and somehow truthful) quote from Terry Deary: 
"I've no interest in schools. They have no relevance in the 21st century. They were a Victorian idea to get kids off the street. Who decided that putting 30 kids with only their age in common in a classroom with one teacher was the best way of educating? At my school there were 52 kids in the class and all I learned was how to pass the 11-plus. Testing is the death of education. Kids should leave school at 11 and go to work. Not down the mines or up chimneys, mind, but working with computers or something relevant. Everything I learned after 11 was a waste of time. Trigonometry, Boyle's law: it's never been of any use to me. They should have been teaching me the life skills I was going to need, such as building relationships, parenting and managing money. I didn't have a clue about any of these things at 18. Schools need to change."

 I enjoy fanfics, where ponies are getting drunk (no clopfics), i read a couple of 'em, but i want more.  




 Hi, a 7305 days ago, i was born here in Prague. Today I am 20, and i am no longer a "teen". Here's a few notes:

- i i am kind and friendly
- i am timid and shy
- i would want a family one day
- i am an atheist

Anyway, happy birthday to me! :)

 After playing a real obscene number of hours in Kerbal Space Program, I got into Simple Rockets pretty well, even landed on the Smoon and Smars - it is a bit easier thanks to being 2D - but I can't seem to be able to match velocity with rendezvoused-with ships. Docking was one of my favourite activities in KSP and I was quite good at it, but afaik there is nothing like relative velocity nullifying marker in SR. I managed to dock only once, and it was not very graceful, which is displeasing.
I don't know how to use that grey thing. 




 It was on Reddit some months ago, it was a project of a group of students of Spanish language. I need it quickl, thanks. 









 a) Every so often I experience a bug where the ship starts to rotate (using reaction wheels, it consumes power) by itself and only SAS keeps it in check and I can't get rid of it (not even by reloading). I suspect it has something to do with using physical/time warp or SAS toggling while rotating. Does anyone else experience this? How to get rid of it?

b) Is it possible to jettison an engine without having it set as an action group? 




 The beginning of the conversation is lost (it began at Omegle, it was basically that he is a Messianic Jew and he believes in the creation by Yahweh). This is copy paste of our email conversation (without names, emails and greetings); I would like to know what do you think of my reasoning, if I should improve something. Thanks.

 E.g. if I was dreaming about riding a rollercoaster which was about to smash into a wall, a cat jumping on me in the real world would project itself into the dream as the impact.

I don't think that the message needs to be spelled out. In this form it is quite obvious.

Aside from the message, it is extremely well done. 




 Hello!
I am quite fond of KSP, and this caught my eye as something I would surely enjoy (building bases/ships/...). It is on sale, however, I can't spend money on it this month. I would be very thankful to whoever would be so generous as to gift me,  and I make sure to pay it forward in the future. :)

 It was an issue we came upon today in school while discussing animal mistreatment. 









 This question occured me today - do the turning radars at KSP point at some specific point or trajectory in space? Is is possible that there are some undiscovered easter eggs? 







































 Fellow froods and froodesses!
Every Earth year on May the 25th, we hold a tradition of visibly carrying towels around with us, because on this date, there is a regular increase in flying saucers fly-bys, though we can't see them easily due to SEP field, and we have to be prepared for sudden untold adventures, Earth demolitions or serendipitious petunia materalizations.

In every case, this act also serves as a homage to Douglas Noel Adams, who ~~wrote~~ received from extraterrestrial beings this utterly extraordinary trilogy in five parts, and decided to share it with us.

Whatever happens this day, don't panic. Or every other day, for that matter...

Just reading this makes me sick. They use religion as an excuse to slaughter each another. It is surreal. 




 I am interested in reading Krauss's book Universe from Nothing, and I'd like to know if the recent discovery of gravity waves affect that hypothesis in any way, and how?

If this question makes no sense, I am sorry, I am no scientist. 


































 Ever since 0.23.5, I am often experiencing a weird time warp/gravity physics bug, where all parts of my vessel except the main part (capsule or whatever) go limp (as if in a freefall without horizontal speed), it becomes fixed (meaning it doesn't move and it is not affected by neither pressing keys or burning) and the trajectory changes rapidly even when not burning. When I try to time warp again it says that the time warp cannot be used under acceleration, or it disassembles rapidly. 

It happens in orbit around Kerbin. 




 I've seen a mod that adds giant asteroids (FSAA or something like that) as parts, but no mods that make them appear like vanilla asteroids. I understand that they would be virtually unmovable, but cool bases could be built on them. Is there any engine constraint preventing this? 














 I have passed both levels in practice tests, but I have a dilemma. I was almost bored when doing B2, but I am not very sure I can pass C1 again, though I did good in the practice test. 




 I run it on an old notebook (to process one chunk of data lasts several hours) and I don't know if I actually contribute to anything. And I heard some skepticims about whether one should run it. 

























































































 It seems to make the game a lot more realistic, if harder. Or there could be an option to toggle KSP/realistic gameplay.

What is the reason for not having incorporated it in the game yet? 









 Today I decided to play Ace of Spades Classic once again, so I go to a server and join the blue team. After changing several maps, one turns up where blue team is having its ass kicked really hard, when a message suddenly appear in the chat:

 We may not be winning in the game, but we are winning in our hearts.

Thank you, random stranger, for encouraging me a little.

 Come on sucker, lick my battery! 




 Do you think it had some connection to THE box or to Rainbow Power? Surely if she was studying somethingunrelated, they could just make her sitting and reading silently? 


































 She's an indoor cat, and we don't plan her to have kittens anyway, so we're going to get her spayed. I googled about it and what are the benefits, but I still feel bad about how drastic it seems and that she won't be able to reproduce. It is just sad :( 









 I sometimes go there to see what retarded things people say there, and it never fails me laugh. But it also enrages me a little, when I what turds can people spew of their mouths, and how ignorant some of them are - religion serves them as an excuse to not seek reason, to abandon critical thinking, to embarras themselves. Cattle do not see the stars and think they are special in the universe. In comparsion with immersity of the universe, we are uncomparably less than nothing.

I hope there won't be a shortage of people who publicly present reason, science, atheism etc. to people, because I have a grave feeling that it might actually be possible for the world to become a place where non-believers would be put ot death, if there would be no vocal opposition.

Just wanted to get this off my chest, carry on, or discuss it, if you wish. 














 I am watching Frozen right now (had heard that it is a nice progressive fairy tale) and it is well known that Disney movies work for majority of people, they can make people smile and cry at every age. Why exactly is that? 









 What if all those things with right arm are just a running joke to tease us, just like with the snail? Are there some solid pieces of evidence implying that he is really going to lsoe his arm?

I just watch the series, I haven't read comics or anything other yet. 














 [In the newest infostorm](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/265-Kerbal-Space-Program-Asteroid-Redirect-Mission-The-FAQ) there was this passage.

 **What is this Claw thing?**

The Advanced Grappling Device, or claw, is your primary means of capturing an asteroid. The Claw works very much like a docking port, however, it doesnt require a mate node to dock to. That means it can grab on to almost any object. Once grabbed on, you can even transfer fuel from the grabbed objects (provided they have any). 

Does this mean that regular docking ports become less useful? This wording implies that I can just launch a fuel tank tank with a probe on it into orbit and suck from it with this claw thingy. 














 I posted some shops to /r/photoshopbattles a few times, but I actually enjoy more cutting people/things out than think what witty should I do with it. 





























 A few weeks ago I have read an article about possible human colonies floating in Venusian atmoshere, and a question occured to me whether something like that would be possible to build in atmosphere of some Kerbol system planets?

I read on the wiki that lighter probes don't even need a parachute on Jool, so I don't think it would be completely impossible. What do you Kerbal rocket scientist think?

 I do it just as a hobby, don't get any money. 
























 Life would have been much easier.

**Edit:**

Utterly meaningless coincidence: 

Bartledanian books are 100 000 words long. According to the [Words to Pages](http://www.wordstopages.com/) converter, a book with 100 000 words written in Arial font size 12 with double spacing would have 365.3 pages. That is almost exactly the same number as number of days in a year. 









 Whoever posts best inspirational quote wins and I'll send them the key. 




 Just because it is so nice and quiet here 









 I get that you can carry 1000 books in a reader everywhere, but paper books are flexible, have "personality", last potentially a very long time and frankly, do you really need to read 15 books at a time? 




 No posts. I am not longer interested in it, so anyone else can take care of it. 


































 I know there is no point to it without mods beside satisfying feel, but i would like to ask you what do you think should be there, how big it should be and so on.

EDIT: Without mods of any kind

 I think we should get a bot which would after typing something like "BibleVerse: Part XX:XX" respond with corresponind verse from standard King James Bible.

Commenters on this sub often adress some verses, so this could be useful. I wonder whether this idea have been proposed before, if it was, i am sorry.

Same could be done for other holy books too.  




 It's because of authority of the person who said them? Or because the quotee formulated the idea so well that a quoter feel they don't need to add anything?

And why some people hate quotes so much?

 



















 I was on Minmus with Bill and Bob. On the top of a lander there was a rolling probe, so i rolled it about 1,5 km away, did some measurements and flew with Jeb to collect data (well, more slid than flew).

When i was a few tens of meters from it, i switched to probe to slightly angle it for convenience. When i wanted to switch back, there was no Jeb.

He disappeared.

I was confused at first and looked for him all over, but he simply vanished. I went to Astronaut Complex and he is listed as MIA.

What the hell?

BTW when i planted the flag i named it Jebediah's Vision after that creepypasta; coincidence much? 




 [SteamID](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197997373039)

It released yesterday, but i don't have any money. It is on sale now. I would be very grateful and make sure to pay it forward later. 




 I play on lowest setting due to my old PC, but i was thinking if i could afford to make my game a bit prettier without losing performance. 









 After almost 300 hours of playtime i found out how to rotate parts in 5 steps and how to clone. I feel stupid. I was thinking how people make Death Stars and bowling balls and lithobraking stuff and it never occured to me to google it.
If i did not watch some Manley's video i wouldn't know it... I thought i figured the game by myself. Well, i have a lot to learn yet.

Edit: And of course the rest of controls too, i forget to mention it. 




 I am browsing interwebs and what i don't see like announcement that the Octodad sequel finally came out! I am extremely happy, but i remember i ran out of my allowance for this month and will have to wait and buy it when it will be not on sale anymore.

So please, if someone could give it to me, i would be very grateful and make sure to pay it forward later.

 I am pleased. I love oatmeal. I think i am going to make myself a cup. 




 The question of money would be put aside, because people would realize the utmost importance of expanding into space, so all materials and workforce would be for "free" (people could even volunteer for working on some tasks like manufacturing parts, which would then be send to ~~World Space Center~~ Starfleet from all over the world; those who participate in programme would get all they need from governments) 


































 Note: I am a fan of 2005's Doctor Who. I am not planning on watching older series, i am quite content with the new.

I must say it is one of the best series i've seen. About a year ago i started to hear from my friends how good it is, they posted DW related things on Facebook and i am naturally quite open-minded, so i put it on my imaginary "To watch" list, but i did not rush in any way, actually, it was one of my new classmates who gave me needed push.

First episodes were feeling like it was a cheap TV production - it probably was, and i do not complain - and it got better with time. I love series which have consistent universe, and DW satisfied me in this way.

Not everyone may see it same, but i like how they put homosexuality in there every so often - i am not a homosexual or in LGBT community, but i am happy for those people, i support them (of course i like gay jokes and so on, but that is different). I also felt some atheist themes in the series, that was pleasant too. I also very like the Doctor's "no guns" policy, it's not something you can see very often today.

I sure am going to continue watching, though i call myself just a fan (don't really have urge to call myself whoovian yet; maybe this will be my backup fandom)

 There is always someone who hasn't seen something yet. 




 I flew to the Mun and collected high amount of scientific data, but i underestimated needed power to get back to Kerbin, and poor Kerbal must have EVAed (of course with data) and set himself on stable orbit. So i send first rescue - it was a probe with four solar panels, i don't know how, but i managed to position the way that no light could reach them, thus rendering probe dead. For my second try i attached two 1x6 automatic panels to it and i even managed to get rendezvous orbit - but in the wrong way! Now i am going for my third try. Wish me luck!

EDIT: Finally! That was insane, it took 4 tries before i managed to pick up poor Kerbal, and then i had to position vessel hanging on a parachute so he won't fall off his seat (another valuable lesson - always using capsules). 









 If i add an addon, will it render my vanilla profile save unusable in vanilla again, even if i don't use modded parts? 




 I have googled a bit, but i can't see nothing. 














 What is the point in rescuing Kerbals?

Have you ever collided with a piece of debris from your earlier launches?

Do you consider mods cheating? 




 I landed dozen or so manned modules on Mun, i learned to dock on orbit (i started to build a space station) and i got a few new upgrades.

 I have never been particularly good at multiplayer shooter games (and I don't play them often, so I am not very skilled), usually I was in the bottom half of the scoreboard, but I always enjoyed myself.

What are your feelings about it and about low-scoring players? BTW I am not looking for comfort, so please speak your honest opinion.

- Philae bounced twice and travelled some distance, but somehow managed to land again and it is stable, but it is rather unknown if it is on its side or upside down or what

- most instruments work, ESA getting science data

- all means of firmly attaching to the surface failed (that is bad for drilling, isn't it?)

- no panorama photos were released yet

Edit: Lol, it was actually three landings 


































 If something goes wrong and the lander bounces off despite the engine pushing it "down", will its mission be considered entirely unsuccesful? Do they have one shiot only or can they try to push it down again after bouncing off?

 I installed WD Black 1GB yesterday, but neither Windows nor Disk Management can see it. I plugged SATA data cable into the motherboard and I am powering it through [SATA-Molex adapter](https://i4.alza.cz/ImgW.ashx?fd=f3 cd=MK297a i=1.jpg) plugged into a cable that was until now powering only 2 fans. I checked the cables and they seem to be plugged well.

Edit:I forgot to add Troubleshooting tag, sorry.

EDIT2: Issue solved, thanks for help.

 It is on sale now, but I really don't have any money left, and it has been made available on Linux now. I'd be grateful if someone were so kind and gifted me (of course I'd pay it forward). :-)

[My Steam ID](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197997373039)

The base game would be enough.

EDIT: I just got it from one of my friends. 














 By idle I mean when they sit somewhere and stare at things. Do they asses dangers and look on their environment for changes or what? 




 If you put a small engine on the bottom of a rocket/tank with larger diameter than  that of said engine, then when you attach something to the engine from below it creates fairings, but those have only the engine's diameter.

It can be secured with struts, for sure, but it looks ugly as hell, and having to meddle with Procedural Fairing's interstage fairings is a bother.

Is there any mod which makes it right?

 I have 64-bit Ubuntu and tried to apply this patch, but it does nothing for solving the mk1podCockpit/model problem for me. :( 




 After X hours of building I am exhausted, so I am going to make it simple:

I have to plug the GPU and 2 fans (front and rear) into the PSU.

GPU has connector, which is split in two, each of them looks like this

 I o x x x I

Both fans also have dual connectors, but they are each different:

 I x x x x I

 I o o o o I

"x"s represent pins, "o"s are holes

The PSU is modular, and I have one cable which corresponds to GPU's and fans' connectors. 


From PSU end, it goes like this:

 I o o o o I

 I o o o o I

 ----------------------------

 I o o o o I

 ----------------------------

 I o o o o I

 ----------------------------

 I o o o o I

 ----------------------------

 IooooI    (a small header connector)

How should I plug it all to the PSU? It doesn't seem doable. 














 I bought some new hardware and got a Radeon Silver Reward code. Since I am not in need of any new games at the moment, I decided to give it away here. You can get 2 games this way.

For my amusement, draw a squird (squirrel+bird) drinking Bailey's out of a shoe, the best/most humorous drawing wins the code (I'll PM it to the winner).

EDIT: It is over, /u/saad93 is the winner. 




 I am about to order all components for my first build and I was skimming through my picked parts when I noticed that PSU was 430 V and recommended voltage for GPU was 500 V.

So I searched for a bit and found a similar question here on BaPC where was said that recommended GPU voltages are for the whole system.

I also used a PSU calculator and it showed me that even less voltage is needed (400 V), so that confused me even more.

How do I make sense of it?

Link for picked parts:

http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/2efx5f/build_ready_is_this_good/

If it turns out to be OK, this post might be regarded as Build Ready I guess. 




 I have decided on my first build, but today I remembered that people recommend to install OS on a SSD. The problem is that I do not have enough money at the moment to buy both at once, so I am torn if I should get a SSD first and add HDD later, or go for some SSHD.

I have to decide quick, since I am going to buy all components tommorrow, so if you could recommend me some drive, it would be great.

Here are the parts I have picked.

My budget is maybe 20 000 K (960.20 USD), this build without SSD would cost me 23 741 K (1139.81 USD).

I can add a new screen and SSD later, but it is going to suck until then (my current screen is a tiny 1024x768 one).

I would appreciate your help with rating this build and, if possible, recommending something cheaper. I didn't make this [Build Ready], because I am not entirely sure yet.

Thanks

What in the actual fuck... Really, this is an example of the perverted religious culture.

 






















































 I'd argue it is very hard growing up in Western culture and not know anything about religion. 




 I would have no problem with religion if people wouldn't believe it. 




 Of course there is a heat shield,I forgot to mention it. 




 Good idea, thanks 




 I am currently designing a lightweight escape pod for two Kerbals, basically seats on a cubic strut with a parachute with fairings (but I don't think they're necessary now). now I have to just solve the stabilization during activating small separating boosters, because it tends to spin instead of keep firing retrograde. 




 You did good. Some people created a dumbfuck religion out of it and try to make it last as long as possible - blame them for that we do not know yet what happens.

 As Cooper is falling in the black hole (or is it already *somewhere else*?) we can see he is falling towards [a spherical structure](http://i.imgur.com/vFciagz.jpg). Given his relative size to [the space of the tesseract](http://i.imgur.com/LD4OvfQ.jpg) and assuming a "chamber" in there is taken as a cubic space with every side being one clearly visible rectangle (or mabe rather the dimensions of Murph's room), I'd assume it could be estimated how many "chambers" there were, but I can't do the math. 




 "Probably a dozen times since their deaths I've heard my mother or father, in a conversational tone of voice, call my name. Of course they called to me often during my life with them  to do a chore, to remind me of a responsibility, to come to dinner, to engage in conversation, to hear about an event of the day. I still miss them so much that it doesn't seem at all strange that my brain will occasionally retrieve a lucid recollection of their voices."

Just thought it would be nice to point it out, since Google search turns out twisted versions of this quote. 









 For me it is a horrible/overly complex UI. That is the reason why I do not play many strategies/MMOs, I just want to have fun without having to learn what all buttons do and so on. But if I immediately think the game is worth it, of course I can sacrifice the time learning it. 




 One of my cats purrs very easily and so I can clearly hear changes in purring, and I noticed about 3 "levels" of purr she gives off depending on the amount of her satisfaction and contentment. The usual purr can then be accompanied by a "deeper" purr or even another sound.

It is mindboggling that it is not funded more. 




 Almost all of my EPL bases are on planets (and one is in orbit above Kerbin), but I haven't as of yet tried to make a functional base on an asteroid. I am not sure if it can be mined without additional plugins (and screw realism, infinite fuel asteroid deposit ftw). Can it? 





























 I have built a base on Duna, but I can't get the converter to convert. There is everything - drill, karbonite tanks, pipes and so on - but the damn thing is stubborn as Jeb. I have tried various pipe flows but it doesn't help. Isn't there a mod which makes it work automatically?

 I want to buy it, but I am not sure about this. 




 I saw some bottles of cider in Tesco and thought it would be nice to drink some again, so I bought a few, but it gave me 
tummy ache and a little bit of diarrhea and I was lying in bed all day. Is cider supposed to do that? Poor Applejack. 





























 I remember nothing else about it, but I saw it maybe 15 years ago 



















 Hi, just a quick question, in some games (currently Just Cause 2) VLC's global keybinding doesn't work. I like to listen to my music instead of in-game music and while it is just a matter of alt-tabbing for 2 secs to make it work and then going switching back to the game, it disrupts the experience. Does anyone know a solution? 
























 I mean, it is fun to have your rovers jumping, tubmling and exploding, but if you seriously need to get somewhere far it is a nightmare, as the rover easily slides. Is there a mod which improves that? 







































 Firstly, some of you may criticize me for this, but I mean no harm - I was browsing FB and look at some dude's profile and there was [this photo](http://i.imgur.com/Zp0JW6k.jpg) of him with his girlfriend. It made me happy for them.

Most people would consider them rather... not pretty, but they don't mind. They found each other, and you can really see their happiness. There is hope for every one of us. 












































 It has this adventurous feel, almost nostalgic. Why is it so obsure, I heard about this twice (the first time I forgot about it). 









 I just saw a ultrasound photo on my feed from my other cousin. 














 The other day I bought a carrot and when I turned a corner to a dark alleyway it hopped out of the bag, pushed me on the ground and brutally beat me up while laughing evily. 







































 In Pale Blue Dot Carl mentions his colleague who visited New Guinea highlands and found a tribe that was ignorant about technology but not about the Moon landing and the astronauts. I googled, but I can't seem to find what tribe it was. Can you help me? 
































































 As of now, shockwaves are only a visual effect and I think that's a pity. It wouldn't have to create a chain reaction, just disassemble things in proximity and push them away (or just push away if more distant). I kind of miss this feature. I googled but to no avail. 









 I built an EPL base on Minmus, but I cannot use it properly because there are two fuel ducts endpoints above the launchpad left over from positioning it and they clip with vessels and fuck shit up. Can't grab them and I doubt I can shatter/smash them with robotic arms. I set up a second launchpad, but I don't want to abandon this one.

[Look](http://i.imgur.com/MEQLMqd.jpg) 









 Upon "finishing" my 0.90 career mode, I started a new game with a couple of other mods, namely Karbonite, Extraplanetary Launchpads, and SCANSat so I try building fully self-sufficient bases elsewhere and explore the system more easily.

I have finally understood how those work, but I am having problems setting the SCANSat big map to the resources mode. It just still displays altitude map. I have sent a probe with both Magnetometer and SAR detector in a polar orbit of Minmus (I don't know whether SCANSat detector is enough). Do I have to activate the magnetometer? It didn't show the option before activating the detector, but activating the detector keeps my energy drained at 0.01, so I have no way to check, because it won't let me.

 


































 I fail to see any reason why it would not be possible, but I haven't tried it yet. The transfer rates should be high enough for it to function. 




 There was a scheduled whatnot with the central heating in our building, he was one of the workers that came here. I did not expect that at all, I was in a bad mood and it made me very happy to see him. I love meeting my old friends. :')

I am just curious, because it must be fucking hilarious. 







































 Specifically, I think of how much would Sun bulge if it was orbiting the Earth and not the other way around. 



















 Often I have problems with the scale of this game and I think "Wait, real galaxies have fucking lots of stars, but it can't be this much.". I am in disbelief when I fly across any galaxy.

 Can I have it? 




 Dammit, this is too good. 




 Why not just replace the word "fat" with "feminist"? They're practically synonyms by now. 




 dunno 




 x-post this to /r/AnimalsWithoutNecks  









 I think it is because movies/shows are linear, noninteractive, and long in comparison with other forms of media. You devote an hour and a half to get a feeling out of a movie, with a song it is just a few minutes - low investment, big reward. 




 I supported the campaing, I hope everything goes smooth. 




 True perfection. 









 /r/titler is better 




 :'D 




 That's the inherent risk of space travel. But space is usually very empty, so the chances are relatively low.  




 What is wrong with admiration for those people? They seriously are amazing. 




 My people need me!

 Bad luck OP? :D 









 You look wholly melted. No wonder, such cute kittes. Hnnng 




 No, I saw it on FB. Feel free to post it there yourself. 




 Yep, I mean, I didn't have a job unless I was almost 22, a year ago. 




 Depends how old you are. 




 Only IAVS thing about this post is the question... 




 Dattup.

Is anyone else stuck at work? 




 Fire resistant?! 









 So I don't get shocked touching the components when blowing the dust if I let it discharge a few minutes first? 




 Ppi isn't the only factor determining visual quality.

 No burn center's can help this boi now 




 Good, good. 




 YES!

 Yes, now I got placebo-vaccine autism (now I actually have two autisms, since I am Brony, right?) and fart chemtrails. 




 What good new science book would you recommend me?

 It was sooo good 




 After that I read that recommended daily dose is 3-4 tablets and that it shouldn't be exceeded. Hehheh. 




 Imagination is limitless I guess. 




 But... but I saw that one GMod video and Billy is still alive! D: 




 It just wants to steal your fingernail. Little mean mofo. :3 




 What? Why would anyone put Christians in a meat grinder? Is there a demand for Christian sausages or what? 




 I think this can but help USA.  




 Pentium II Skynet is near! 




 You got the point, but I'd say be glad it is becoming dilluted... 




 Ummmm... I am at work atm, but I have to see that video when I get home. Can't decide what is a bigger glitch - this or the Danny's Device.

 Ok, cousin. I'll be there in an hour.

 I haven't tired of that yet :P 




 I skimmed through, just a bunch of dentist/medical stuff, nothing really interesting (aside from the very hot student, of course). I guess she is studying to be either a dentist or a nurse (if it's legit and not scripted).

BTW at the end when she squirts the teacher comes to her and discovers what she was doing and is berating her, it gets extremely awkward, a boner killer. Geez, we all should learn to just pass things like this in silence, discreetly, we are sexual beings, after all.

 ...and I love it. Till now the only GTA I've properly played was GTA:SA - it was amazing for its time, but there were missing things and in GTA IV it's quite polished - I love the driving physics, car damage, the police ain't so bad, plenty of side activities to do, Niko is a reasonably ralatable character, I might learn to better understand accents. 

It was because I had read about GfWL and R* Social Club that I was skeptical about it (I hate when games push me into logging in in some service that has no value for me (Steam is an exception) and it serves only as DRM that pirates will workaround anyway... 









 ...and dictators die... 




 That's the problem with KSP, there are many useful keyboard shortcuts, but the game won't tell you about them. 




 I wish there was, but afaik there isn't. 




 There is that black-and-yellow strip under the staging gui that has no use, so I though perhaps there could be a staging lock button that would activate/deactivate spacebar staging. I am suresure many of us accidentally deconstructed our space stations when hitting spacebar with elbow/cat/piss bottle/whatever, so I think it would be a useful feature for 1.1. 




 Can I get it powdered? I don't have the time to ground it myself. 




 That would be a standard good dad reaction, I think. 




 That seems more likely. 




 I love when cat licks my hair.

 I read the Hitchhiker's before I knew about Marvel Thor, and I think they're pretty different.

 Btw my tablet has a bad habit of duplicating words or eveneven messing up entire sentences adding deleted thingsthings, anyone know howhow toto fix it? 









 There is something for everyoneeveryone in HHGTTG, I love it. 




 Hi, I just want to say that people often confuse me for you, and that the similarity of our nicknames is purely incidental. :-) 




 No, I am not him. I was asked a couple of times before though. I have identified with this nickname since primary school. Copypaste of my username's origin :

It has nothing to do with fun. It has to do with panting. "Funt" means to pant in Czech and when I was little and used to go to school with my sister I would pant because she was bigger and older than me and I had problems to catch up with her. Idk exactly when it happened, but she called me "funk" a couple of times, I think, and I made a nickname out of it later. It is not easily translatable, but I think "the little one who pants" could be fitting.

Btw it's uncanny, though, we both live in Europe and I am just a few months older than he is. 




  One cool thing about FAR is that it gives you tons of information about how your aircraft will perform right in the SPH

Assuming you know how to interpret the data. :D 




 I was pretty content with 1.0 aero, but I am going to try the hell out of this. 




 There is a overlap. 




 Send a rescue mission right away. 




 I am the same.

Btw have some feels

 So there would be a lot of hypertext, right? 




 You should go to the doctor who told you that and say "Dismal sperm count? In your face, ha!" (   ) 




 I know. I slapped on so many engines because I couldn't get to Bop and I didn't know atomic engines use only LF now.

 YOLO 









 I am proud to be the first day presser. 









 I think it will not because of all the shitty air your breathe out. Not even lactobacillus wants to smell your boogers. 




 Misleading thumbnail, I thought it was a big sausage. 









 The more horrible the better. 




 Which .cfg? 




 It can take a moment, and sometimes you don't have those few seconds, for example when tumbling down a cliff. 




 True, but rockets IRL are not so wobbly. 









 You tried to mine on Bop, didn't you? 




 ooh right, I almost forgot 




 I couldn't agree more. I can't wait till this gets in games. 




 *bites lip* 




 Hahaha, it is so cute how the flail their limbs ineptly :D 




 I do - ejectable rescue modules. Basically fairing "capsules" with seats on cubic struts with parachutes and slightly tilted sepratrons. I tested that, it works great. Just shoot retrograde and it comes down.

Edit - and of course heat shields, how could I forgot to mention them 




 We should just rip everyone's genitals off so they are not distracted while working. 




 Good day Mr. TheMindsEIyIe, could you come with us, please? 




 They should really make that you can strut the payload to the fairing like you can with procedural fairings. 




 Or sideways 




 If only I had known this yesterday... 




 I should try and make ground-space missile sometime. I am not sure what mod I'd need though. Lazor Systems? 




 Ace Jebediah - what a guy! 




 Uh, where we're going, we, uh, don't need no antennas. 




 Yes. 




 Humans make determinations of things they haven't tried all the time. I very much doubt you don't. 




 Thanks for nightmares. 




 Are you 12? 




 It's after midnight here, I'm in bed.

 Not enough meds, then.

 Oh, fantasies 




 Sandstorm 




 I actually began to buy Mountain Dew every so often because of Reddit... 




 Darude 









 Well, I played laser tag in a reputable arena and I don't think this is better. 




 "You'll walk... With a limp!" 




 Reddit is like Monty Python, but completely different. 




  Also the button does not feel pain. It is a button

Ok you got a point with this one. 




 I'll pass, real laser tag is better. 




 Didn't you know? The /r/gaming is all about nostalgia. 




 You are admitting to being a part of the problem - you want the button to last as long as possible, and we all want to know what happens when it runs out. You are despicable.

What if the button is in pain and it screams PRESS because it eases its pain? 




 I wouldn't change my flair for anything. 




 The button clearly says "BUTTON PRESS BUTTON PRESS IT BUTTON THE BUTTON PRESS IT PRESS THE BUTTON BUTTON BUTTON PRESS IT THE BUTTON THE BUTTON PRESS BUTTON IT PRESS IT THE BUTTON PRESS IT NOW", so you are clearly commiting a heresy against the button by waiting. Pressing the button should be your duty since the button commands you so. 




 All purples are equal. 




 Kerbal Space Program: The Prequel 




 A few days ago I landed on Minmus but realized I hadn't restored one of my science instruments, so I went down from the orbital station with a jetpack -if it weren't for ragdolling, I wouldn't have enough monoprop left to do that. 




 I strongly disagree, ragdolling is very fun in KSP. I would keep the ragdolling but as other people have pointed out in this thread, the issue is the recovery. When you want to ragdoll you just let it be and when you don't you should be able to instantly recover. 




 Why do you think it doesn't fit? 




 There was a thread when OP asked what would people do with their clone. A lot of people answered they'd fuck themselves. So, if you'd fuck your clone, your copy must also be pretty much into it. 




 Why? 




 If dV requirements stayed the same, then from Eve to low Moho orbit is is takes 1600 m/s of dV according to this tool

http://ksp.olex.biz/

Something something Oberth effect, like in a sense that a burn is more efficient when done closer to the source of gravity or whatever (except in case of plane change), so it is not very much higher with planets closer to the Sun. 




 Purple Master Race 




 But you liked it, right? 




 My own pronunciation is a wreck. 




 Oooh, I might've seen some of it when I was little-r, but I don't remember it very well. Might see again I suppose. 




 I probably haven't seen those movies because I don't get it. 




 Funny thing with DistantObject, though. I was playing with that in 0.90 and the DO planet dots were not showing up where they should be in map view, but danced around. Idk, I have not installed DO in 1.0 yet. 




 HL3? Maybe, idk. A new mascot guy? I don't see why not, but there is only one change so far, so there is no sign that is should be a pattern.

BTW the current one with the head turning is pretty creepy imo. 




 .cx

 ( o  o) 




 heh 




 Consoles aren't either. 




 "money this with buy"

-st. ermagherd 









 Honestly, I think I'll install it when I get home. 




 My brain hurts. 




 I dare not guess. But the idea of an interplanetary orbital station which flies from place to place stripping places of their fuel and science is strangely attractive. Maybe even smaller inter-asteroid station would pay off with science gains (considering the negligible dV requirements for moving between them). 




 Moho and Tylo are like muggers who stop you in an underground crossing at night and take all your dV.

Eve and Laythe are like pedophiles who lure Kerblings into their cellars with science and lock them up.

"Hey kiddo want some science?" 




 I am also planning to design something like that. 




 I am addicted to alt+F5 




 I once drove a wheeled module 50 km on Duna to my base. Never again. 




 More like a "computer" simulation - I imagine Saint's Row-esque small cyberspace box to test your stuff in without consequences. 




 From my experience, NERVA tended to overheat when on a large craft, but it is still quite efficient. I think it would be amazing on very large crafts constructed in orbit, which I have never done. Eh, I think I should try it and fly it in orbit over Duna. 




  Looks more like a four dimensional engineer to me, though.

The next update is leaking. 




 It is the only way to be sure. 




 Ain't a launch if it ain't blowin'. 




 Is there a mod to unblacklist all names? 




 No, it's just funny how on reddit there are always found people of the same profession field (jest pretenders aside). It is amazing.

BTW any advice for home cleaning?

BTW2: Have you played Viscera Cleanup Detail? 




 So you say keep your best for the last few seconds and leave the apartment only after you have prepared a breakfast for her?

Are you really? 




 It is a common misconception that only guys piss on seats. Women can somehow do it too. 




 I think I am predestined to be a wizard. 









 no, I was being genuine, because I cannot Seem to think of any 




 I meant knowledge about religion in general, not just the useful bits. 




 What about heat? That kill Kerbals.

[My design is somewhat simpler](http://i.imgur.com/05wzTZL.jpg) (sorry for it not being transparent, there are two cubic struts on top of each other with 2 batteries and 2 seats on sides and 1 parachute on the top inside).  I tested it and it works, the fairings proved to be necessary since the heat/hot air killed the kerbal even behind the heat shield. The spin stabilization works, no need for a reaction wheel. 




 Can you think of some examples of religion-exclusivities?
