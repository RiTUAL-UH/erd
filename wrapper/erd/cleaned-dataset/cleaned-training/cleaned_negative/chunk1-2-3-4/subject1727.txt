 I think there are probably some 'good' elements within the intelligentsia that are probably trying to expose things. I think Assange might be one of those conduits...  




 claim 6 dependents like I do...

 She couldnt really believe that right? I mean shes just trying to get attention right?   RIGHT!?


Also, equating "trickle down economics" with bussiness job growth is just stupid... these are the people running the country... Either a true believer, a complete idiot, or evil... 




 Who liberty is being infringed upon by Cliven Bundy? The liberty being lost in that situation is Cliven Bundys... the arbirary line being drawn in that situation is STILL THE GOVERNMENT...

Bundy in my view actually has a legitimate homestead claim on that land predating federal regulation. In the legal sense its a matter of original appropriation and mixing of labor with the land that the family has established. 

Thats not to say that the land isnt truly the property of Native Americans which Im sure used the land before whites. They have the claim of original appropriation and in my view a right to the land. but within the current legal paradigm Bundy has more right to the land than government... 




 Thats completely different. Private property rights prevent that and even if you do I can seek compensation in the courts. Governments cannot own property. Borders are nothing more than the outlines of the territorial monopoly of the state.

Individuals have the right to travel while not infringing of others personal property. Just because foreigners enter the country doesnt mean they are just going to be going all willy nilly crazy and "come live in your house, eat your food and fuck your girlfriend..." lol thats obviously absurd.

I agree wholeheartedly that immigration should not be subsidized though. Just like it is not moral to prevent someone from following their own feet with the monopoly of force called government... it is likewise not moral to force taxpayers to pay for them... 




 Most arent ready to identify all as human beings having the same unalienable rights. My liberty doesn't somehow become null and void just because I cross an imaginary line drawn arbitrarily on a map by politicians... Every individual has the right to travel to better his circumstances... 

The startling thing is that there are probably around the same amount of 'illegals' fleeing the United States right now for freer countries and better opportunities. 

I agree with your proposal. People are not 'illegal' just because government gives them that designation. They are free. The problem with immigration policy as this article points out is that it is subsidized. The drug wars affect also should be considered. By ending the drug war, opening up borders, and killing subsidies, the market will put these people where they are most needed and most productive.  
























 So suicide prevention hotlines are feeding information to police? WTF *...added to my list of NEVER CALL* 




 Tom woods has some good information on this:

 Actually, there have been many controlled experiments proving traffic laws, speed limits, and stop sign/lights actually impede the natural flow of traffic and in the case of speed limits can actually be dangerous(especially when set to low.) 

Much of the world actually dont use any system of regimented traffic laws. In those countries traffic moves much quicker as individuals negotiate their way on the roads...   




 You mean taxing the shit out of employers doesn't create jobs? *noooo* 




 It had a legislator but no executive branch of government... 




 I think Joesph played a significant role in the awakening of people to the fed... It seemed the original Zeitgeist gained steam just as Ron Paul was flaming the issue. I think we owe him alot. Even for just getting people to think about alternative ideas... 

His 'solutions' however are nothing I would ever want to be apart of ever.... 




 and this is even though they have dramatically raised the costs to do this...

 this gets more infuriating every time I see it... 




 Silly Snowden..... doesn't he know all good in the world springs forth from government and if we didn't have our wise betters in Washington loyally toiling for the public good that we would all be savaging for worms in the ground and living in huts!? That 5-year-olds would be working in mines!? That our toasters would explode and our homes would collapse!? Think god for our benevolent public servants! I can eat a ham sandwich with piece of mind now! /s 




 ever time i ever posted anything there its got dogged.... I think the last comment I got was:

more crap from the Mises Institute clogging up the interwebs...

...so your comment is encouraging...  




 yeah i heard this a while back, that illegal voting blocks have the numbers to determine close elections but as libertarians I really think we should really be welcoming these people. Not just because the statist idea of borders is an initiation of force but because most of these people are fleeing failed socialist regimes. Contrary to popular belief I bet illegals hold fundamentally libertarian beliefs. Its the Hispanic Americans that are mostly leftist...  




 I pay around 58% 




 yes they are called progressives... 
























 What does a group created and sustained by the state, that fights with other states about being a state have to do with a poly-centric law society...?? 




 lol thanks:) 









 good point... whos to say what 'hate speech' will no longer be protected by the first Amendment on the new 'free and open' internet... 




 wanna keep something 'free and open' - regulate the shit out of it... lol these ppl... 




 I love this guy. It was so classic when he [told a statist on facebook that they were to stupid to vote and that they shouldn't!](http://dailycaller.com/2014/09/20/libertarian-nominee-in-n-c-senate-race-calls-voter-ignorant-moron/) he was polling at like 11 percent until then... lol

[Also looks like hes launched a strong internet ad campaign](http://www.medicaldaily.com/pro-marijuana-ads-hulu-nc-politician-sean-haugh-goes-all-pot-legalization-307869) 




 Uh yeah... in a free market bad actors fail... you dont need more government to undermine what government is doing in the first place... you need the exact opposite....
