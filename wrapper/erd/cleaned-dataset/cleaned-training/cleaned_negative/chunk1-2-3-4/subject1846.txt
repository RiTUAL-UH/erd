 Damn, this made me really sad for some reason. I just want to give her a hug. 









 Ok, thank you! Love the whole video! 




 The clip at 2:10 with a the back of some guy's head giving a speech or something to a bunch of people in gray jumpsuits, sitting down. 




 The clips with all those people in the gray jumpsuits, where are those from? 




 Came here to say this, lol! 




 Oh so sorry m'lady, it's not often you see a beautiful woman such as yourself on sites such as these. You must be very intellectual, are you an atheist by any chance? 




 It's a secret or I wouldn't understand? 




 Here's the thing. You said a "black person is in prison."
Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.
As someone who is a scientist who studies blacks, I am telling you, specifically, in Ebolatology, no one calls black people prisoners. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.
If you're saying "negro family" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Niggerae, which includes things from niggers to negroes to lightskins.
So your reasoning for calling a black person a prisoner is because random people "call the black ones prisoners?" Let's get sandniggers and mexicans in there, then, too.
Also, calling someone a nigger or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A nigger is a nigger and a member of the negro family. But that's not what you said. You said a black person is a prisoner, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the negro family niggers, which means you'd call lightskins, sandniggers, and other races prisoners, too. Which you said you don't.
It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know? 




 My friends joke that I am Jewish because I have a big nose, guess I am Jewish now! 




 Which guy? 




 My favourite from that episode is when he says he's 2/15ths aboriginal. 




 It says Iron Man is 6 foot 5 but isn't Downey Jr. shorter than 6ft? 




 Thanks for your answer and I will definitely check out that book! Thanks! 




 These days, you can't talk about war veterans without talking about PTSD. It gets a lot more attention now than it did a while ago, and I was wondering how it was back in the times of muskets and even swords. Did it happen as commonly as today? Was it treated as a real problem? How did people 'cure' it?

 I often get these kinds of thoughts. I suddenly become aware of how easy it would be for me to just whip out my dick and rub it on random people. 




 Nice try. 




 Yeah I know, the problem is I need to shoot from farther because the camera lens doesn't have the greatest macro capability. 




 HAHAHAH This is incredible, you are incredible. 




 The only good thing that came out of this tragedy is that it really helped us unite with our brothers down south.

 I am a big fan of Louis CK, and I would love to know more about how he was on the set of parks and rec, as Dave. What is he like in person, and while working on a show?

 If Warner Brothers revives the Harry Potter franchise with a new storyline, are you going to be making an appearance? 




 Thanks :) 




 Thanks so much, buddy! 




 I just learned of this recently in my high school history class. At the Battle of the Granicus, Alexander the Great was about to be killed by Spithridates, a satrap, from behind. As his arm was striking, Cleitus the Black severed his arm just before he could deal the finishing blow. Cleitus the Black was a commanding officer of Alexander. I did a project on the battle. It was really like out of a movie. What's ironic is, later in Alexander the Great's conquest, he killed Cleitus in a drunken quarrel. 




 She's streets ahead if you ask me. 




 Thanks!

 Ok, thanks a lot!
