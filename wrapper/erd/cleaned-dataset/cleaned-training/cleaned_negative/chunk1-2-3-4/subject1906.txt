 are the Muslim extremists? sorry, too soon Ik.

Seriously though, these 'sound' as though acts of true desperation. It is not as though NK has a lot of allied countries.

Worrisome as the economic situations of the poor keep plummeting in so many places globally. 




 ' "This action is an unjustified provocation against the feelings of 1.5 billion Muslims," the authority, Dar al-Ifta, said." '.

Get over it already! If you don't like what you see either stop looking at it or out your own eyeballs. Stop attempting to dictate what other people choose to think/draw/write/imagine/love/teach/wear/believe/and so on   on   on etc.

The Heart Of The World-The Elder Brothers Warning (documentary The Kogi Elder)    http://vimeo.com/103812927   
  About: ""The Heart of The World: Elder Brother's Warning was filmed by Alan Ereira for the BBC in 1991
"In a desperate attempt to prevent further ecological catastrophe and destruction, the Kogi Mamas broke their silence and allowed a small BBC film crew into their isolated mountaintop civilization to hear their message and warning to Younger Brother (those (un)conscious people who mashing up our environment). The subsequent messages and warnings were voiced in this documentary. After the documentary was filmed, the Kogi Mamas returned to their work in isolation and asked outsiders to not come to their land.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Kogi soon realized that their message and warning had not been heeded by Younger Brother, and instead, as they had predicted, many catastrophes occurred and the natural world continued to be devastated at an even more rapid pace.[7] In turn they contacted the same filmmaker twenty years later to give one final message. This became Aluna, a documentary made by the Kogi Mamas themselves in which they give a second warning and say that they have chosen to share their secret sciences with Younger Brother so that Younger Brother can help change the world for the better."

  The Pass was actually confirmed as results of an avalanche

 That is what you said initially.   
  Then you tossed in a Wiki page, the first sentence of which refers to 'avalanche' as "plausible":"but avalanche damage is considered one of the more plausible explanations for this incident.[4]"

 It goes on: "Possibly negating the avalanche scenario is that investigators saw footprints leading from the campsite, with no obvious avalanche damage noted."

 /u/Iamnotyours makes a very good point regarding these 2 incidents.

 oh my, have to agree.
 "PETA euthanizes nearly 90 percent of the animals it takes in, a rate often criticized by other animal groups. PETA defends its practices, referring to itself as a shelter of last resort - a place that provides a merciful death for animals too sick, old or otherwise unfit for adoption.

But state regulations call for a minimum holding period of five days, said Debra Griggs, president of the Virginia Federation of Humane Societies. Pickups are also required to be reported to a locality's animal control.

"In Maya's case, PETA did neither of those things," Griggs said. "It's a serious violation."

Aside from that, she said, the video shows "a happy, healthy, sweet dog on its own property, and that flies in the face of everything we believe in - not only about our pets but our property rights in general."

 Opinions are influenced by one's gender though, IMHO.  

Forced wearing of the hijab, or of any other enforced clothing, will often have gender-specific reactions as to 'how important is it?', as an example.

Let me see what people are saying..ah ok, here ya go: http://www.ted.com/conversations/23808/how_does_gender_affect_formula.html

oh and 'gender bias' is a thing. Google. 




 The hijab is a VERY obvious sign of the oppression of the female populace, it those countries where it's wearing is not a choice.  




 Google always thinks I am a male.

 Here is the problem.  Young Michael Brown was a tall, large teenager, he looked like a grow man, ' he was 6' 4" (1.93 m) tall and weighed 292 lb (132 kg).

Mr. Brown was 18 years of age. An adult.

I can understand how intimidating a young man of that size might be.

Michael may or may not have been a bully; reports say he was much better than that, but the video!!

I give my warmest heart felt condolences to his parents, family, friends.

I know of no one with a perfect child; we are each   every one, simply human.

Now why burn down you town?  Honest it is a very bad reflection on the black/white relationships here in the USA.

Please calm down out there, peaceful protest will garner far more support than the videos of a liqueur store being broken into,the toy store, the etc. shops.

sorry  am rambling, it sucked to have to call my son (working in a Newark hospital, just to review the 'if you get stopped by an officer keep your hands in plain site on your steering wheel. If you are asked for ID tell the officer that you will need to reach into you back pocket, ask is that ok?  Always speak respectfully." 

If you should get arrested, call your parents! You are entitled to a call.
Keep your mouth shut until you have  a lawyer, say nothing.

But for goodness sake , the images of looting in the community liqueur store, toy r us, etc you all are setting back race relations like 50 years!! 

Just stop the stupidity, fires do not help.
 




 ty, my son is working ER rotation in Newark Nj tonight.  I appreciate all news. 




 thanks.
 




 can you share those please? 




 oh. That makes sense somehow, thanks:) 









 I paid my rent, gave my son a 125 check   took him out for an inexpensive dinner for his birthday,  ( he is in school). I spent 25$ to renew antiviral, bought some little food, am basically ok atm.

But I am literally down to pennies, and was wondering if I could borrow 35$ from someone until my next pay day, 11/21.

I know many are in much more need, I am happy to have a roof, a wonderful child, lights   internet access, but naturally all my grand planning has left out a few odd things like a prescription renewal, and that cup of coffee I usually buy before my 12 hour work days a couple of times a week. 

I have no idea how this works, how money gets moved about, but scouts honor I will pay back the 35 next Friday the 21st (will probably be after work, like 8pm ish est)

I have had backpackwayne added as a friend for ages, unbeknownst to him, as at one point I was having terrible trouble finding a job that could pay my rent in nyc, and he was so wonderful in offering advice and listening to my laments!  (so now I rent a room in jersey city btw).

Not a druggie, not a drunk, work at low $ job atm, planted daffodils (free from the city), love life, love my family, love tghis sub, and always wish I could help more. 

Anyway I thank you for your consideration. Would be greatly appreciated! (lol though I warn you again, I will need to have it explained how this actually works:)

Thank you all amazing people!

 Teen Driver Charged In Hit-And-Run Death Of Ariel Russo, 4, Accused Of Dragging Police Officer
September 3, 2014 5:05 PM 














 I'm an American with deep respect for the members of our military. Today I have heard countless people wishing others a "Happy" Veteran's Day. When I think about my great uncle's mustard gas poisoning; what my father saw liberating concentration camps   afterwards, returning with yellow fever from Panama; my brother's stories of being dropped behind enemy lines in Vietnam..well I just weep, and say a very quiet 'thank you'.  I can't seem to bring myself to think of Veteran's Day as 'happy' knowing the hell so many have gone through. While it was still armistice day, I can see people using 'happy', but now? My question is this: What sentiment would you folk like to hear on Veteran's Day, today   in the future?   thank you all. 




 I just came online, and my multi bar is gone. Anyone else getting this? Any clues why this has occurred? 




 My Italian aunt (mom's sister) has always told me that my father's father was 'black Irish'. Now I have gone on the assumption that this meant he had dark hair/brown eyes, possibly a remnant (in my eyes) of that dang Roman invasion of ages ago.   However! I have searched 'black Irish' here   in r/history   r/Irish history   /r/ Irish....only to find that Montserrat video:(   So! Please historians, more in depth info pretty please??? 
























 Someone please explain why I need to wait 8 minutes between saying "that's old" and saying "you all seriously need to stop making me laugh, my computer is getting nervous.  
And yes, you do totally win!"

umm seriously, tell me what is it that I am doing too much?  '

(after my original wait time expired said"no nipples?" to the naked woman/man poster. Still was required to wait another 8 min.)  WHY???

also what is the FC named? May take me until tomorrow to ask that here. And yes I saw the side post link, put it did not work on this differently advantaged comp of mine. 



























































 I haven't received any notice to go to court, just a letter from landlord's lawyer telling me to pay or they will begin court proceedings. I know I will have to go, but am so afraid of an immediate lock-out.  

Will I get any time to finish packing?  

Please help, I need info!!! 









 Seem's to me I read BBC, CNN, Huff.post and just see redigested news I read here first. (BBC is actually much better, please forgive me). MSNBC also seems so slow.

http://history1900s.about.com/od/famouscrimesscandals/a/rasputin.htm 




 yea that really surprised me seeing those two little sections. 




 I suppose IF in fact the statements are false he could. That is a big IF though. 
Also IDK if there is a warrant for the arrest of an adult is that considered open to public knowledge? I would think so; I'm not a lawyer though.

Edit many hours later, fyi:  ( yea from wiki:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_defamation_law)
"Defamation law in modern practice:
Defamation law in the United States is much less plaintiff-friendly than its counterparts in European and the Commonwealth countries, due to the enforcement of the First Amendment"....etc bla bla...
  "One defense is reporting or passing through information as a general information or warning of dangerous or emergent conditions, and intent to defame must be proven. Also, the truth of the allegedly defamatory statement will always negate the claim (whether because the plaintiff fails to meet his/her burden of proving falsity or because the defendant proves the statement to be true).[11]"

so you see? the burden of proof of innocence often appears to fall upon the plaintiff in these cases.  

"Libel is a method of defamation expressed by print, writing, pictures, signs, effigies, or any communication embodied in physical form that is injurious to a person's reputation, exposes a person to public hatred, contempt or ridicule, or injures a person in his/her business or profession." fromhttps://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/libel

I want to be real clear here that I am in no way standing up for a pedos nor anyone else's right to harm children. Nor am I presuming the perhaps defamed, originally accused (Joe if u lost track) man to be guilty.   

 




 yea they have a kind of old school sound. lol def not electro-pop.

 They claim to have found after taking the computer from the Joe guys brother, and taking this brother's word that Joe was the one that down loaded it?

Then waiting 6 years before looking at the evidence on the computer??

I think there is room for doubt, due to the inept handling of this case from start to the current state of affairs which I hope is not the end. 




 yes stunning isn't it? It's just morally incomprehensible. And not just the policing side, the DA side of things smells so bad I rather think a higher level of investigation on this entire fiasco should be conducted. 




 Idk if we need boots really as much as robos to build things like weapons systems and mining ops. 




 The entire story seems a fiasco! They seized Joe's computer based on his brother's say so? then...
 "For nearly six years, nothing happened. Its not clear why, but perhaps because the original detective retired in 2007.

The computer sat at the state police Computer Crimes Unit in Lansing without being forensically examined. A note in the file in 2007 shows state police couldnt find the search warrant or consent form to search it. By 2008, records show, state police were considering destroying the evidence after a review of the complaint showed issues over burden of proof" "

So for 6 years this accused pedo was allowed free reign!!! (on his upgraded computer no doubt). Outrageous.

The arresting the wrong guy part is the least of it almost, though I have to ask, if they thought  Dean was the man, they (thankfully as it turned out) allowed him to remain in a home with 4 children?  

ok brain is broken now, too much lack of logic for me in this story. 




 Billy Dean Rowe being the one falsely accused.

Though who the hell knows, maybe they both are innocent. Seems everything else was majorly botched, so I can't put a lot of stock in the supposed confession that the Billy Joe guy is purported to have made. This is one messed up story.

There was a poppy nailed to the wall?

Surely an about-when can be determined as to when this was built. Maybe it was built as a rudimentary shelter from either bombs or weather?

Also btw, it is illegal to sell off personal papers/photos generally.  I have personal knowledge as well of at least 2 people contacting the buyer and making an arrangement for the return of their stuff. 




 Wow, thank you:) 




 this one would even work with mixed races. We could have 'nigllas' and 'chinllas' (lol also apparently a picturesque place in Peru),; even chingers (hmm another one that is already a word, so idk), etc.

 Well you know the whole Russian attitude toward homosexuality   all that:) 




 When certain substances such as corticosteroids   opioids are introduced exogenously I believe the body decreases endogenous production in response over the course of time. 

Were we able to develop formulas for individualized optimum levels of various neurotransmitters, and introduce some sort of bio-sensor coupled with IDK, nanotechnology I suppose,  able to block/release the assorted neurotransmitters in response to the bio-sensors readings.. then we could potentially all be an emotionally stable, happy happy army I suppose.

 As I understood it when I got nosy during the Steve Jobs Brazilian wheelchair pic moment, the technology to do a head transplant theoretically exists, but the real problems surround the connection of the spinal cord to the brain.   Quadriplegia is the likely outcome.

It is frightening to think of the extended lifespans of the 1% once the little issues regarding spinal cord connection are worked out.

 someone needs to contact the person in the photo, she may have some sort of 'intellectual' (ahrmm) property suit.  




 I have a dreadful fear that this look will become a trend for spring or something. 




 see that was where my brain was heading, increased entropy   all that ,but all this surface tension talk has me ..idk, interested. 




 oh thank you for starting my morning off with a good laugh!  Sorry about the girl, hope the next one hugs you in the religion's non-approved fashion :) 




 Yea I've seen similar situations where one among a group of irl friends  suddenly dies. It seems to sometimes spur others on to make improvements in their own world (I am thinking specifically of one young man that died of an overdose; not long after at least one of his good friends went sober, so yay to that). 
The online friends thing is slightly more difficult I thing in terms of mourning, although things like this happen: http://puu.sh/btytv.jpg  They are planting flowers in memory of a friend.

 arg ok I am replying to a bot.. I did say the original dates from 1938 but this was released in '42.

I added the 'short description' as a commement as it isn't all that short.

Help please, oh bot of wonder?? pretty please? 




 Hi sorry if I have submitted wrong (hope not!)  

The original film dates from 1938, this version was released in 1942.

Film plot courtesy http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_Br...
Miss Carol (Diana Durrell) is an idealistic teacher in a remote one-room schoolhouse. A native of the Ozarks herself, she is determined to stop the practice of child marriage, in which older men marry teen or preteen girls. Her campaign raises the ire of some local men, led by Jake Bolby, who drag her into the woods one night with the intention of tarring and feathering her. Before they can do this, however, Angelo the dwarf and Mr. Colton arrive with a shotgun to save the day.

Following this, Jake Bolby comes across young Jennie Colton swimming naked. When her father dies, Bolby decides to take advantage of the opportunity to blackmail her mother into letting him marry the girl, threatening that otherwise he will see her hanged for murder. After he "courts" Jennie by giving her a doll, the two are married. It later turns out that this ceremony was illegal, as child marriage had been banned several days prior, but this point quickly becomes moot. Before Bolby can consummate the union, he is gunned down by Angelo. Jennie leaves his house with Freddie, and the movie ends. 









 we may need a new sub, something like trashy home decor maybe.

I really had doubts on the posting, and I thank you for your help in modding this wonderful sub.

cheers! 




 I have lost a couple of friends that I played with on a mmorpg.  It felt similar to losing rl friends:( 

I met the mother of a player ( I did not know that young man, but recognized his name when she used it as her email), and I felt such an immediate connection to her   to her loss, I think more so than had I not realized he was a player on that game. 

Internet mourning is a real thing.

Thank you for the reply, I was rather curious as to the question myself:)
 




 curious as to why you are asking. 




 I think that the sort of 'magical thinking' of childhood extends a bit longer than most seem to believe.  
 
 That there is some sort of argument within the minds of semi-grown children as to whether "I wished my friend would die because I was mad, and she did, so it must be my fault' vs. " No that can't be correct, I didn't really want her to die   didn't hit her with that car". 

Just seems the magical thinking continuing must have some sort of contributing factors, be those drugs, isolation, wacko parents, idk.

ok just speculating here, pardon me. 




 Was there a note or something that indicated why he choose this route? He really seems like an amazing kid. 




 I don't even know where else to put this, yes it is a bit long(60min) but includes every manner of morbid crazyness including tarring   feathering, alcoholic man beating wife, child marraige , etc. 

It is billed as an educational documentary, but more like a social guidance film perhaps. 









 Why would  Gd even need to have an assigned sex?

 'Glad They Cleared Up That Mistake
February 15, 2015 by Hemant Mehta 

Boyd W. Thomas wrote a letter to the editor of the Lexington Dispatch (North Carolina) thats just gloriously weird. It begins like this:
God states that seven kings must come before the rise of the Antichrist. Revelations 17:10 says the seventh king will reign for a short amount of time. Is Barack Obama the seventh king?
I guess when the article ran, though, the headline said something like Is Obama the Antichrist? Which caused the editors to have to correct their mistake in an even more memorable way:
 *[here they duplicate the Correction as printed in the Dispatch, it made me chuckle]
So the headline is now accurate on the website. Even though the letter itself, which is the real problem, will never see a correction.
Because Murica.'

 arg ok I am adding this from wiki: 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Bell#Life_after_prison
Conviction[edit]
On 17 December 1968, at Newcastle Assizes, Norma Bell was acquitted but Mary Bell was convicted of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility, the jury taking their lead from her diagnosis by court-appointed psychiatrists who described her as displaying "classic symptoms of psychopathy". The judge, Mr. Justice Cusack, described her as dangerous and said she posed a "very grave risk to other children". She was sentenced to be detained at Her Majesty's pleasure, effectively an indefinite sentence of imprisonment. She was initially sent to Red Bank secure unit in St. Helens, Lancashire  the same facility that would house Jon Venables, one of James Bulger's child killers, 25 years later.[1]

After her conviction, Bell was the focus of a great deal of attention from the British press and also from the German Stern magazine. Her mother repeatedly sold stories about her to the press and often gave reporters writings she claimed to be by her daughter. Bell herself made headlines when, in September 1977, she briefly absconded from Moor Court open prison, where she had been held since her transfer from a young offenders institution to an adult prison a year earlier. Her penalty for this was a loss of prison privileges for 28 days.[6]

For a time, Bell also lived in a girls' remand home at Cumberlow Lodge in South Norwood (in a house built by Victorian inventor William Stanley).[7][8]

Life after prison[edit]
In 1980, Bell, aged 23, was released from Askham Grange open prison, having served 12 years, and was granted anonymity (including a new name) allowing her to start a new life. Four years later she had a daughter, born on 25 May 1984; Bell's daughter did not know of her mother's past until Bell's location was discovered by reporters in 1998 and she and her mother had to leave their house with bed sheets over their heads.

Bell's daughter's anonymity was originally protected only until she reached the age of 18. However, on 21 May 2003, Bell won a High Court battle to have her own anonymity and that of her daughter extended for life. Any court order permanently protecting the identity of a convict in Britain is consequently sometimes known as a "Mary Bell order."

In 2009, it was reported that Bell had become a grandmother 




 hmm. I tend to want to err on the side of the child.  I know there seem to be some that are born lacking the capacity to be empathetic.

I still hope that as a society we will take measures to ascertain the possible source of such horrifying behavior, and to remedy whatever may have been behind the fury   lack of control.

re the Mary Bell  case: http://www.theguardian.com/uk/1968/dec/18/ukcrime.childprotection
  "Dr Westbury's inquiries indicated that the matter was the responsibility of the health department of the Ministry of Social Security said the judge. But the department "require time to consider what they are to do and no specific time is indicated."

He continued: "It is an appalling thing that with a child as young as this one, one has to take into consideration such matters. I am not entirely unsympathetic but anxious as I am to do everything for her benefit, my primary duty is to protect other people.

"There is a very grave risk to other children if she is not closely watched and every conceivable step taken to see that she doesn't do again what she has been found guilty of. In the case of a child of this age, no question of imprisonment arises. I have power to order a sentence of detention and it seems to me that no other method of dealing with her in the circumstances is suitable."

Life detention, he said, did not mean that the person concerned was kept in custody indefinitely or for the rest of their natural lives. The position could be considered form time to time."


Adding this, just started watching but it seems ok: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFhGzE_xRI  The Mary Bell Case 




 I once worked in a children's home/hospital. We had a young girl that was HIV positive (this was back in the mid '80's).

Everyone was very happy for her when she made her first communion (yes it was a Catholic place.). Someone bought her a pin to commemorate the occasion, and while pinning it on the girl inadvertently poked her skin.

This resulted in an infection which overcame her,   she died soon thereafter.  =(   true story.

Also the use of intoxicants, even just alcohol, may lead one to the belief that the long, soulful eyes thing is communication.

I once had a long and interesting ..conversation ..with some guy I met in Paris waiting for a train to Spain. I spoke no Spanish that week, he spoke no English. We managed to converse so well we actually argued as he thought that my asking where he was from was a racist question. Lol I know this sounds bizarre, but somehow we communicated.

  (Reuters) - Russia is ready to hold talks on a new agreement to control conventional arms in Europe, a Russian Foreign Ministry official said on Wednesday, after Russia announced the end of its participation in the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe.

"We are ready to look at the possibility and carry out corresponding talks on a new agreement which would adequately address new realities... and take into account the interests of the Russian Federation," Mikhail Ulyanov, director of the ministry's department on arms control, told the Interfax news agency.

While I tend to believe most reading this particular thread have the sense to not simply run to the doctor   demand a prescription based on what an anonymous voice on the internet has told them, I thought it warranted mention that not every drug is compatible with every person's situation.

 What /u/jewelsteel said makes sense. 

I want to add though that I withdraw from people when things in my life get tough. It's just what I do. This could be loss of job, financial difficulties, almost anything particularly worrisome. 

I'm fairly pedestrian, so I'm betting there are plenty of others that do the same.

 "According to the WHO classification of 1995 [10] used in this study designed in November 2008, FGM/C can be divided into four types:

Type I: Excision of the prepuce and part or all of the clitoris.

Type II: Excision of the prepuce and clitoris together with partial or total excision of the labia minora.

Type III: Infibulation. Excision of part or all of the external genitalia and stitching together of the two cut sides, to varying degrees.

Type IV: Pricking, piercing, incision, stretching, scraping, or other procedures harming the clitoris or labia, or both.

Types I, II and III of FGM/C present severe health consequences that have been well documented by several authors. The immediate health complications include shock, haemorrhage, infections and psychological consequences [11-13]. The long term health risks consist of chronic pain, infections, cheloids formation, primary infertility, birth complications, danger to the new born and psychological consequences [13-18]. Even FGM/C types I and II, sometimes considered as more innocuous, may involve severe health complications. For example, they have been reported to provoke unequivocal complications like shock, haemorrhage, urogenital complications [12], obstetric complications [18] and sexual dysfunction [15].

Despite the documented adverse effects of FGM/C, a recent review article states that its overall prevalence has declined very little [19]."

 This paper seem to place the possible origin outside of china (http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Black-Death.pdf)

"Infection and migration
Spread of the black death in Europe. 
 The plague disease, generally thought to be caused by Yersinia pestis, is enzootic (commonly present) in populations of fleas carried by ground rodents, including marmots, in various areas including Central Asia, Kurdistan, Western Asia, Northern India and Uganda.[15] 
 
Nestorian graves dating to 1338-9 near Lake Issyk Kul in Kyrgizstan have inscriptions
referring to plague and recent investigations by the Russian archeologist Chwolson show a high incidence rate and are thought by many epidemiologists to mark the outbreak of the epidemic, from which they could easily have spread to China and India.[16] 

In October 2010, medical geneticists confirmed that the plague came from China.[4] In China, the 13th century Mongol conquest disrupted farming and trading, and led to widespread famine starting in 1331 with plague arriving soon after. The population dropped from approximately 120 to 60 million.[17] The 14th-century plague killed an estimated 25 million Chinese and other Asians during the 15 years before it entered Constantinople in 1347.[18]

The disease may have traveled along the Silk Road with Mongol armies and traders or it could have come via ship.[19] By the end of 1346 reports of plague had reached the seaports of Europe: "India was depopulated, Tartary, Mesopotamia, Syria, Armenia were covered with dead bodies".[20]

Plague was reportedly first introduced to Europe at the trading city of Caffa in the Crimea in 1347. After a protracted siege, during which the Mongol army under Jani Beg was suffering the disease, they catapulted the infected corpses over the city walls to infect the inhabitants. 

The Genoese traders fled, taking the plague by ship into Sicily and the south of Europe, whence it spread north.[21] Whether or not this hypothesis is accurate, it is clear that several existing conditions such as war, famine, and weather contributed to the severity of the Black Death."

 While I agree that this does seem a hoax post, I think your presumption that a 70 yo will be unable to understand what trees is after 1 day on reddit is mistaken.

I am not quite 70 (yet) but got off the defaults on ..think it was the 2nd day on site. I stumbled on trees (which I am not subbed to) in some roundabout way ( I do sub to /r/marijuanaenthusiasts though so maybe I was looking up an actual tree? lol idk).

70 years olds   those near/aapprox that age are often active on many sites, so the lingo thing is moot. I know a few personally.

Ageism is so unattractive. 




 "One girl said: "I turned up at the police station at 2/3am, blood all over me, soaked through my trousers to the crotch. They dismissed it as me being naughty, a nuisance."

Another told the authorities: "The Asian men felt they ran Oxford. That was exciting. People were afraid of them. I felt protected. People respected them."

Fear is not respect. Subjugating young girls may be the theory that these geniuses have developed to aid the acceptance of certain facets of a culture; these facets have no place in western societies.

 Remember when you were a child, and were told   thus believed that 'you can be anything you want to be, if you are willing to do the work' ?

Well lots of folk are 1. Not told that.  2.Not getting the education required to move on to a position of hope; neither at home nor through public education. 3. Do not innately possess, nor have it nurtured in them, the inner fire required to succeed against all odds. 

I can go on   on.  Truth is we can (almost) all survive in the wild were we not to cave in to despair, and were we to think.  Would help if one's parent(s) took one out for a walk in nature now   then, or had the sanity to think of their child(ren) as just that and not a buddy nor an albatross, and spent a lil time actually teaching them the silly things their parents taught them, and the ones before as well.  Oh gee I seem to be going on   on despite myself.

-- A resilience master plan that provides a framework to address and expand on the institutional, adaptation, preparedness, and recovery strategies;

--An adaptation master plan that describes specific projects and initiatives for the city to undertake that increase the city's resilience with particular attention paid to shoreline protective measures, new buildings and flood proofing for facilities;

-- Design standards that ensure building designs allow for floodplain management compliance and also maintain the desired streetscape environment;

-- A capital improvement plan that describes projects, budget, and funding sources for capital investments that improve resiliency.

-- An urban environmental design plan that describes strategies that mitigate storm impacts, including stormwater management techniques;

-- Amendments to the zoning and building code that require approaches to rehabilitation and new construction that are more resilient, but still maintain the character of existing neighborhoods.

 Conclusions

Based on the available data, and using internationally accepted methods to assess the
evidence with the most appropriate analytical techniques, WHO concludes:

1. Caesarean sections are effective in saving maternal and infant lives, but only when
they are required for medically indicated reasons.

2. At population level, caesarean section rates higher than 10% are not associated with
reductions in maternal and newborn mortality rates.

3. Caesarean sections can cause significant and sometimes permanent complications,
disability or death particularly in settings that lack the facilities and/or capacity to
properly conduct safe surgery and treat surgical complications. Caesarean sections
should ideally only be undertaken when medically necessary.

4. Every effort should be made to provide caesarean sections to women in need, rather
than striving to achieve a specific rate.

5. The effects of caesarean section rates on other outcomes, such as maternal and
perinatal morbidity, paediatric outcomes, and psychological or social well-being
are still unclear. More research is needed to understand the health effects of
caesarean section on immediate and future outcomes. "

WHO proposes the Robson classification system as a global standard for assessing,
monitoring and comparing caesarean section rates within healthcare facilities over time, and
between facilities. In order to assist healthcare facilities in adopting the Robson classification,
WHO will develop guidelines for its use, implementation and interpretation, including
standardization of terms and definitions.

Very weird. Does this island attract future serial killers?

oh jeez worse. "From August 1838 ten Aboriginal prisoners were sent to Rottnest Island (known as Wadjemup to the Noongar, possibly meaning "place across the water"[8]). After a short period when both settlers and prisoners occupied the island, the Colonial Secretary announced in June 1839 that the island would become a penal establishment for Aboriginal people and, between 1838 and 1931, Rottnest Island was used as a prison to transfer Aboriginal prisoners "overseas".
"It has been estimated that there may be as many as 369 Aboriginal graves on the island, of which five were for prisoners who were hanged."

 Wow,  I am so thrilled that I just read "The father was not charged with any crime.

Chitwood said the man was just "acting like a dad", and he didnt see anything to charge him with.

Asked whether he had any issues with the fathers actions, Chitwood said: "Not as a police chief and not as a father."

Police Chief Chitwood is the type of person I would happily elect to higher office.  

..and Go Dad!! for acting like a father and still having the sense to not carry it so far as to endanger himself with a jail term.

 Climate Change, Water, and Risk Current Water Demands Are Not Sustainable

Climate change will have a significant impact on the sustainability of water supplies in the coming decades. A new analysis, performed by consulting firm Tetra Tech for the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), examined the effects of global warming on water supply and demand in the contiguous United States. The study found that more than 1,100 counties -- one-third of all counties in the lower 48 -- will face higher risks of water shortages by mid-century as the result of global warming. More than 400 of these counties will face extremely high risks of water shortages

He shot his brother Trevor Pimentel, 16, in the leg before killing himself

Kevin and Trevor had been cooking about 6pm when an argument erupted

Their mother, Helen Campochiaro, 38, was working one of her two jobs 

Relatives say she was a single mom who kept a gun for protection and that the boys had been brought up with gun safety

On a Go Fund Me page set up one day before the shooting, Campochiaro asked for help in raising a deposit for a new home"

 why do you say that "(16 year old probably lied)" ?? 




 why do they have enough bullets for this to have occurred, yet apparently not enough food for the 3 boys?  Or were they arguing about what type of rice is the best?

Idk, this is very sad. 

The mother and another brother (age 18) were not at home. I hope the 16yo will recover well, and go on to lead a wonderful life; the mom   elder brother as well.   http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/03/25/food-argument-leaves-2-brothers-dead-1-wounded/70467588/

Edit to add that I really! hope that the gun did not belong to any of the children. IDC, if this was the parent(s) loaded gun that did this, let them suffer. I just really hope it was neither the 18 nor 16 year old's. 




 crap, you mean I need to look again and not back out after the annoying captions? crap. taking a deep breath...cul

edit: was worth it:) 




 I have learned to despise emojis somehow. I'm actually glad that they are unsupported by chrome. Then again, I am one of 'those' people that have never had a fb account.  ok, 'nuff said 8-D

ok and some people interpret that as a male sexual organ! sue me! 8D 




 Thanks for making me actually lol:) 




 More worrisome to me is what kind of "petty, selfish, discriminatory piece of shit" teachers go along with them?
  "East High Principal Ken Thiessen says, Teachers told the parents they would prefer he not wear the letter on his jacket."

 I'm seeing different reports on how many are missing, most seem to be saying 2.

This young man, Nicholas Figueroa, is being searched for by his family. He was on a lunch date at the sushi place apparently. 
The woman he was with has been found, and is hospitalized.

 "Thank's for uploading the amateur film, filmed by the American tourist Benjamin Gasul during his visit to Europe in spring 1939. Benjamin Gasul visited Warsaw in early May 1939, and filmed in one of the streets in the old Jewish quarter in Warsaw, about four  months before the German attack on Poland on September 1, 1939.
Benjamin Gasul was born into a Jewish family in Riga in 1898, and emmigrated to USA. in 1910's."

 "Dear Madame Lori Bernstein it`s very said and highly unjust what You say,
that movie was obviously produced before German Nazis conquered Poland.
Date of movie: May of 1939
Date of German nazi invasion on Poland: September of 1939
In the moment which is presented in movie there were NO ghetto in Warsaw.
I would appreciate if You look on Warsaw Ghetto history at YadVashem Institute website: http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/holocaust/about/03/warsaw.asp

In that time (presented at movie) Polish Jews were living in all sites of our tolerant community. Jewish and Polish people where living, studying and making businesses together.
And Polish people are the biggest worldwide group helping Jews in World War II, look again at website of YadVashem...:
http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/righteous/statistics.asp

In our country (only in Poland and Yugoslavia in occupied Europe) helping Jews was endangered by inmediate death penalty to all members of family helping Jews (by giving shelter food or whatever). That execution was realised by German Nazi soldiers in home where they found such a family.
http://www.ushmm.org/learn/timeline-of-events/1942-1945/german-poster-announces-death-penalty-for-aiding-jews

Among the others who risked lives of their friends Polish Jews where members of my family (my Grandparents). And forgive that question, but what Your family did to help Jews in Poland?". 




 If it was a benefit of her employment, she likely wasn't paying for it, or was doing so at a discounted rate.  Perhaps they capped the coverage. 




 She was working in the field. Supposedly it was part of her employees benefit package. 




 I can't come to a conclusion one way or the other. 

She was born in Germany, but attended high school in USA   was working in job in which I think she would have needed good language skills.

 ..and on that note, good night!   




 low sodium concentration in blood = hyponatremia.  It is relative. 




 the condition is not about fluids, but about sodium concentration.

so either too little sodium or too much water in the blood, basically. 

 




 think so.  low sodium concentration in blood. 




 Im the one thats hurting. Im the one thats lost everything that means anything to me, said Garrard. (the grandmother). Quote from:

 would you then please post something related from an unbiased party please?  or maybe a link for the first line of your post?? 




 I literally just said aloud " Good Work!".  =) ty 




 No. It just takes effort here. 

I have a bad habit of ...say eating a tomato, and being all like 'gee that was yummy!', and thus saving some seeds.

I have become more conscious of where the fruits   vegetables I eat come from of late. 

Also just research your seed sources. Do a simple  search of say 'non gmo seeds' or 'organic seeds', and read! the results. They twist language a lot on the advert sites,in case u hadn't noticed:)

I need to link this simply on the grounds that I searched as I recommended above, and I have some sort of combined ' No! this is bs! attitude combined with  a 'gee, that sounds so sweet:)' attitude.

( also IDK what all is the truth in this, nor do I work for any companies mentioned, nor for those unmentioned. In fact I need a job:) )


 




 on the other hand, it is good to know:) 









 A female, pretending to be a male, working as such in a patriarchy, is
honored by the government as the " ideal mother of Luxor governorate."

oy vey!!

:)))) 




 Does anyone have an interest in working out the first usage of 'homeboy'??  

I have heard/read at least 2 different origins in the last minute:) 




 He sees the lone pedo to his east in the pic.  

(Hell maybe he is simply caught up redditing through his glasses?? The guy looking east while all else look west)

Third row-ish north    third row-ish west from the bottom right corner. 

EDIT: is that op???  looking at the google glass instead of the kid???  time traveler!!! 




 try not to buy the genetically altered seeds. Just don't. 

At least not " seeds treated with neonicotinoid pesticides produced by the German chemical giant Bayer.

And that may be very bad news for honey bees, which remain in a dire state of health, riddled by large annual die-offs that have become known as "colony collapse disorder" (CCD)."

http://www.motherjones.com/tom-philpott/2012/03/bayer-pesticide-bees-studies

 




 that is not the same distributor (bayer) as OP. Thank goodness!! 




 sadly, you are correct.

Finland and Poland too are fairly tough. Put our troops there??   Like this?

 "State attorney general
  
The state attorney general in each of the 50 U.S. states and territories is the chief legal advisor to the state government and the state's chief law enforcement officer. In some states, the attorney general serves as the head of a state department of justice, with responsibilities similar to those of the United States Department of Justice."  

from wiki: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_attorney_general

So yes, the state attorney general is a power office. 




 I think maybe she is a young woman allowed little freedom. 

Perhaps she has been schooled at home, not often going outside, and perhaps had the sun moon/day night explained to her as "the sun circles the earth, then the moon comes out. Like when I spin this coin, the sides facing us change."

Or so I would like to believe:) 




 hell, the image in my head is haunting me! 

That child, that 5 year old baby, has been majorly screwed with; I just hope s/he will be able to somehow recover, forget, move on, have a wonderful life:)  

I can hope:) 




 Is this Stew Pit? 




 It was in both /r/buildapc and /r/pcmasterrace by op /u/LittleBowsa. Sorry can't link atm. 




 I really enjoyed that, thanks for making me smile. 




 This is really awesome, ty. 




 thanks:)  Must have:) 




 yea I'm pretty sure she should be looking for an obstetrician. Hope s/he has awesome eyes. 




 It did send me off of a wiki journey where I have learned something about steatopygia, elongated labia, Saartjie Baartman, and the Khoikhoi people.  

All morbidly interesting, though I may need a drink now.
 




 Holy smokes.  A 5 year old found the baby. To me this the worst part, as horrible as it all is. 
 
"the baby's body was found on the kitchen counter by a 5-year-old relative who was dropped off to wait for his bus to school. 

The knife used on the baby was found placed in the dead baby's hand, Deters said." 




 I like 'OK'.  No one really knows... this is an interesting obituary, of the etymologist who, "FOR much of his long career studying language Allen Read sought the origin of OK"
    "Mr Read showed how, stage by stage, OK was spread throughout North America and the world to the moon, and then took on its new form AOK, first used by space people and frowned on by purists. This being an exercise in the academic world, there remain some doubters. Some believe that the Boston newspaper's reference to OK may not be the earliest. Some are attracted to the claim that it is of American-Indian origin. There is an Indian word, okeh, used as an affirmative reply to a question. Mr Read treated such doubting calmly. Nothing is absolute, he once wrote,nothing is forever.

 My high history teacher told us it was a password for the underground railroad. 




 I guess people that do these sort of bizarre things are geniuses? 
No idea. 




  If it was a white or Asian teacher referring to a black student with the 'n' word every time she called on him in class,  would you be satisfied with a 5 day suspension???

Editing to add I am happy that the kid was unfamiliar with these slurs. Thankfully he had not experienced that particular reference (raghead taliban) prior to encountering this genius of a 'teacher'. 

First encounters with blatant racism can be pretty traumatic. I will be surprised if the parents don't file a suit in civil court for damages. 




 I find the story sad actually. her husband dies before the baby is born,  then So as to protect myself from men and the harshness of their looks and being targeted by them due to traditions, I decided to be a man  and dressed in their clothes and worked alongside them in other villages where no one knows me.  The daughter marries, husband  has something happen which leaves him unable to work, so grandma is continuing to work to support them all   the grand kids.  




 look at the actual article. It isn't this simple. 




 no that's some quality 5 head..maybe a 6. 




 souls for sale?? 




 I must have missed that in my outrage, it's too soon for me to look again though. Hope whatever your dad is doing helps and does no harm. 




 yes! and shore up Alaska.
