And if he condones the use of Sarin by the Rebels, but not the regime, then he will lose even more credibility. His red line should be for anyone using Sarin. This isn't a game. I think we just need to stay out of it. Its not our fight. Are we going to have to go to war with these rebels in 15 years after arming them to the teeth?

 I agree. The most effective change needs to be done on the State level. Which is how our country is supposed to work. We do not need a larger federal government making general policies for everyone without understand what effects it has on individual local economies. Everyones needs are different. Plus I do not think we grasp the problem enough to implement broad federal changes at this point.. Things need to be done on the state level and done with what is best for that States environment. The problem with this is citizens always try to make change on the federal level. The biggest impact we can have is starting local and seeing what works best for individual communities. Things that work will translate into general public policy.  




 I agree. Its the nature of the beast. Automation will reign supreme in manufacturing. at some point. 




 I apologize if I took your comment wrong. But increasing minimum wage overnight would be very damaging to the bottom line. I would love to increase pay for all of our workers. But there has to be a realistic option that would not cause businesses to close their doors or leave communities jobless because all companies have pulled out. It has to be a slow and methodical change. We just cant add millions of dollars to our costs overnight and not expect a catastrophic event.  




 You seem to have no grasp on reality. If 1000 people lose their jobs that will be a much larger drain on the community than having people work, pay taxes, be provided health insurance, retirement plans (which we match), etc. Take that away and the local economy would be drained from all of the extra social services and less tax revenue. Tell your local commissioners to have all companies like mine shut there doors. Then come back and tell me what happens to your economy once this happens. You think its bad now it would be catastrophic doing things your way.  




 I am not forcing anyone to keep their job. They choose to stay here and work. If they can find a better job or higher paying job whats stopping them from going to get it? I am not keeping them here against their will. Most of our employees are happy with their jobs. Plus we susbsidize our employees healthcare. Which costs us $millions$ a month. A MONTH. They pay a 1/4 of the total cost of their health insurance because we subsidize it for them. Like a lot of companies do. 




 So you think the almost 1000 people we employ would be able to find another job when we are one of the largest employers in our region? lol It would just cause even worse conditions for people in the local economy. And I am not forcing anyone to work for me. They choose to work for us because we provide them with a job. Which is better than no job? Welcome to the world economy. Welcome to the giant sucking sound. Welcome to reality. 




 I agree that automation will kill lots of jobs. Increasing wages forcefully will only accelerate the idea of automation. Businesses have to continue to create their products. We are a world economy and a balance must be met to compete. If Americans want higher wages that just means less jobs. So take your pick. Less pay more jobs or more pay less jobs. That is the reality.  




 If my company went out of business almost 1000 people would lose their jobs and there is nothing in this area that would be able to fill them. So tell me how that would benefit the local economy or the overall economy? We are in the process of eliminating jobs with automation because margins are so thin as it is. You do realize US manufacturers have to compete with 3rd world countries correct? So we have to keep a balance or people will lose their jobs and be even worse off. This is not black and white. You cant just say *increase wages* and it not cause a ripple effect.  




 We are. We are in the process of transition. Our company has increased automation by almost 20% in the last 5 years. 




 No it wont. If I were to increase pay it would wipe out my margins leaving me selling my product at a loss and eventually shutting our doors. That would help the economy correct? Us shutting our doors taking health subsidies, jobs, and state federal taxes with it. Thats what you think is good for the economy? 




 They are laborers. Labor is a direct business cost.  




 My company doesnt provide a benefit? lol If my company went out of business almost 1000 people would lose their jobs and there is nothing in this area that would be able to fill them. So they would become an even more drain on the social system than they already are. If they want to make more money. They need to go get training and learn a skill that demands more money. And if increasing worker pay causes inflation to the point where the increase in pay is depleted by inflation cost in goods purchased then they would be in the same place they are now. Still requiring subsidies. On top of that my company pays out $millions$ in healthcare costs to subsidize the employees healthcare. Just like many businesses do. If we did not subsidize their healthcare they would be an even bigger drain on  social services.  




 I can only pay what my company can afford. Businesses are in business to make money. Just like employees get up and go to work to make money. We pay our skilled laborers a decent wage. 




 This is exactly what is happening or going to happen. Working smarter = less employees and more automation. So what would be the point of increasing wages if less people would be getting a wage? How does that help? We already pay our skilled workers a decent wage.  




 Yes they are. This is why we are seeing manufacturing move to places like Vietnam or Mexico. 




 Exactly. Increasing the minimum wage will only accelerate this from a Manufacturing standpoint.  




 "Skilled" laborers make more than minimum wage. Machinists, electricians, plc programmers, etc. are paid above minimum wage for their skill.  




 They wont pay more. If you force a company like mine to increase pay which hurts the company, we will just move our operations overseas and no one will have a job that relies on my company to provide for their family. We have done everything we could the last 6 years to decrease costs and compete with China. Increased labor costs would push us over the edge and require us to move our operations to keep our customers. Customers will not pay more if they know they can go somewhere else and get it cheaper. Which would happen. 




 Well I can only speak from a manufacturing standpoint. And if I remember correctly we are trying to ramp up manufacturing in the States. This would cause us to lose out to countries with lower labor costs. The only heavy turnover I get is from people that just don't like to show up to work. Workers cant go get a better paying job doing the same thing at other manufacturers either. Cause they are in the same boat as me. We are actually replacing workers with machines to increase productivity. I will not create work ethic for someone else. If they want a job and work hard they will get hired. If they do well I will look for ways to promote them.  




 Inflating cost of goods to give people more money is inflation. The same people I just gave the raise to would pay more for the products they were buying. Depleting any raise I gave them. Aside from that it would cause my company to lose business to manufacturers in other countries like China that have lower labor costs.  




 I know the company I work for is the only manufacturer in the United States for the product we make. If we were to increase costs it would force our customers to look at manufacturing from other countries. We have done all we can to compete with other countries as it is. Increasing costs would cut our legs out from underneath us. 




 Kind of hard to cut costs when you have already done that. The recession caused manufacturers to run lean and thin. They are already running lean and thin. Not much more room to cut. 




 My margins are almost non-existent. What little profit we do make we use to increase production capacity or hire new workers when demand increases. With an increase in direct labor costs I would no longer be able to do that. In fact it would cause me to sell my product at a loss resulting in possible closure of my operation.  




 I can tell you from experience. I manage a company that manufacturers goods. If I was forced to increase direct labor costs, with the thin margins I am already at, it would cause me to let workers go or increase the costs of my goods.  




 No one said it is the only cause of inflation. It will just cause more inflation. Its apparent no one in this thread has ever owned or managed a business. You cant just pull money out of thin air. Companies have to compensate for this increase in labor costs. They will do this by letting workers go or increasing prices on their goods. This is basic economics. This will be passed on to the consumer.  














 It will cause inflation.

 "I have already intimated to you the danger of parties in the State, with particular reference to the founding of them on geographical discriminations. Let me now take a more comprehensive view, and warn you in the most solemn manner against the baneful effects of the spirit of party generally.  
  
This spirit, unfortunately, is inseparable from our nature, having its root in the strongest passions of the human mind. It exists under different shapes in all governments, more or less stifled, controlled, or repressed; but, in those of the popular form, it is seen in its greatest rankness, and is truly their worst enemy.  
  
The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge, natural to party dissension, which in different ages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is itself a frightful despotism. But this leads at length to a more formal and permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries which result gradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the absolute power of an individual; and sooner or later the chief of some prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his competitors, turns this disposition to the purposes of his own elevation, on the ruins of public liberty."
