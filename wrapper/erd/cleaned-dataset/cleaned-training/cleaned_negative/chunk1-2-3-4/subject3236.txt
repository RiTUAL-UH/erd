 your welcome mate 




   Its winter in Australia right now

hahaha sorry I didn't thought about it.. I recreated the logo from scratch. [here the psd](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3jagjlacGj2MXQzUmdpeE41RGc/view?usp=sharing) 




 I run Win 7 x64 with 8 GB Ram and with Photoshop CC 2014 I didn't have any problem. Then I did a format and upgraded to CC 2015. Since then I can't render videos when I send and animation to render and photoshop crashes once in a while in various cases. Is anyone experiencing similar situations?
