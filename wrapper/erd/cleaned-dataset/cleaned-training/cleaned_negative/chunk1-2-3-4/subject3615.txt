 This article in the *Washington Free Beacon* was the only source of info (all other articles merely repeated the vague details from the Free Beacon)

http://freebeacon.com/national-security/cia-official-dies-in-apparent-suicide/

Even stranger still was the TIMING of the release of the article: 11:46 PM on a Friday night. It was also just one day after the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence had voted to release the $40 million Torture Report which looked into CIA actions in the post-9/11 era. There was also some hearings on Benghazi that week as well...

So NO ONE at any news organization has been able to follow-up on this in the past month? 


 












































 Very suspicious timing for release of this info as well--article was published at 11:46 on a Friday evening...All follow-up articles were derived from this original Washington Free Beacon article and no other info has been published--**no name/age/sex of victim, no date or time of death, no location of incident, no official cause of death**...

A senior CIA official has died in an apparent suicide this week from injuries sustained after jumping off a building in northern Virginia, according to sources close to the CIA.

CIA spokesman Christopher White confirmed the death and said the incident did not take place at CIA headquarters in McLean, Va.

We can confirm that there was an individual fatally injured at a facility where agency work is done, White told the Washington Free Beacon. He was rushed to a local area hospital where he subsequently died. Due to privacy reasons and out of respect for the family, we are not releasing additional information at this time.

A source close to the agency said the man who died was a middle manager and the incident occurred after the man jumped from the fifth floor of a building in Fairfax County.

Many agency employees are known to work under stressful conditions and high stress is considered a part of the profession, for the three general types of employees: Intelligence analysts and support personnel, technical services operators, and members of the clandestine services, the agencys elite spying branch.

The CIA is known to operate or rent space in a number of semi-secret locations in the country, including at least one high-rise building in Tysons Corner.

The agency also operates a number of top-secret facilities used by its clandestine service officers, including agency safe houses.

No other details of the death could be learned.

The agency is currently engaged in a high profile dispute with the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.

Sen. Diane Feinstein (D., Calif.), chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, has said the CIA has blocked efforts by the committee to investigate harsh interrogation of terrorists.

Committee staff members working at a CIA facility in Northern Virginia to investigate agency interrogation practices also have charged that the CIA covertly searched the agencys computers that were being used in the investigation.

The agency subsequently reported that several Senate staff members had improperly and possibly illegally removed classified material from the CIA. The FBI was asked to investigate the mishandling of classified information in the case.

The agency is under pressure from Congress to declassify a 6,000-page report on agency interrogation techniques, including waterboarding, used to glean information from al Qaeda terrorists captured after the 2001 attacks on Washington and New York.

The agency also this week came under scrutiny from the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence over the agencys role in obscuring the facts surrounding the Sept. 11, 2012 terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya.

Former CIA Deputy Director Michael Morrell told the committee that agency analysts concluded that a protest took place in advance of the attack that killed four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens.

Morrell testified that subsequent information revealed this judgment to be incorrect.

The CIA was operating a facility in Benghazi with a large number of agency personnel whose activities had not been made public.

Speculation about the CIA annex in Benghazi has focused on the agencys role in supplying weapons to Libyan militias that in turn were shipping the arms to Islamist rebels in Syria.

 According to Daniel Ellsbergs *SECRETS: A Memoir of Vietnam and the Pentagon Papers* (2002):

However, in the fall of 1961 a highly secret, dramatically revised national intelligence estimate turned the strategic world that had preoccupied me for three years upside down. The missile gap favoring the Soviets had been a fantasy. There was a gap, all right, but it was currently ten to one in our favor. Our 40 Atlas and Titan ICBMs were matched by 4 Soviet SS-6 ICBMs at one launching site at Plesetsk, not by 120, as in the latest national estimate in June, or by the SAC commanders estimate of 1,000 I had heard of at SAC headquarters in August. The specter of a deliberate Soviet surprise attack suddenly appeared, with the new estimates, to have been a chimera. 

...the new estimate was kept effectively secret from Congress, the press, and the public, and it had a comparably imperceptible effect on military programs. It was after this secret recognition that the Soviets  had deployed four liquid-fueled ICBMs to our forty that the Kennedy administration decided, in the late fall of 1961, on the appropriate size for the projected force of U.S. solid-fueled Minuteman missiles: one thousand. That was less than the 1,600 to 6,000 that the air force had earlier requested, but it was down only to the level that Secretary McNamara had earlier decided on *before* the new estimate. (pages 32-33)

**THREAT INFLATION**

------------------------

The 6 paragraphs below are taken from Chapter 7 of a free online book *The Pentagon Labyrinth* (2011). Full article "Follow the Money" by Andrew Cockburn (2011): http://pogoarchives.org/labyrinth/07-cockburn-w-covers.pdf

------------------------------

Recall that following victory in World War II, the U.S. rapidly disarmed, disbanding its huge conscript army and slashing weapons production. The economies of our allies and enemies in the recent conflict lay in total ruin. Although the Soviet Union controlled eastern European states overrun by the Red Army during the war, this was by prior agreement with the U.S. and Britain. Suddenly, in the spring of 1948, senior officials of the Truman Administration suddenly began issuing ominous warnings that the Soviet Union was bent on war and might attack at any time. A warning to that effectwar could come at any timewas solicited by the chief of army intelligence from the U.S. commander in Germany, General Lucius Clay, and duly leaked to the press.

Why?

The answer is clear for anyone who remembers to follow the money. The aircraft corporations who had garnered enormous profits during the war on the back of government contracts had discovered by 1947 that **peace was ruinous**. Despite initial high hopes, the commercial marketplace was proving a far harsher and less accommodating environment than that of wartime, especially as there were far more companies than required by the peacetime economy. Orders from the civilian airline industry never lived up to expectations while efforts to diversify into other products, including dishwashers and stainless steel coffins, proved disappointing and costly.

Something had to be done. In the spring of 1948 senior officials in the Truman Administration, including Secretary of Defense James Forrestal, suddenly began warning that the Soviets were on the brink of unleashing a surprise military attack against Western Europe. There was **no evidence** that the Soviets had any such intentions, a point, as declassified documents now make clear, that was well known to the senior officials. In fact Stalin, the Soviet leader, was enjoining the powerful western European communist parties from any revolutionary action and refusing to aid the Greek communists in their civil war against the U.S.-backed government.

This cause (need for stimulus in the aerospace industry) and effect (war scare leading to sharp increase in defense appropriations) was pithily summed up at the time by Lawrence D. Bell, President of the Bell Aircraft Corporation: As soon as there is a war scare, there is a lot of money available. And so it proved. The aircraft procurement budget soared **57**% as the overall Pentagon procurement budget exploded by almost **600** percent from less than $6 billion in 1947 to more than $35 billion in 1948 (in contemporary 2011 dollars). The industry, not to mention powerful institutions linked to its fortunes, such as **major banks**, was saved from collapse.

Apart from a brief relapse pending the outbreak of the Korean war in 1950, war scares, otherwise known as **threat inflation** would thereafter be a regular feature of the U.S. political and economic landscape. It mattered little what the Soviet enemy was actually doing, or in a position to do. All that was required was for an announcement that intelligence had revealed an ominous gap between U.S. and Soviet capabilities, and the money flowed. The missile gap on which John F. Kennedy rode to victory in 1960 yielded an immediate fifteen percent hike in defense spending. Years after the money had been appropriated and spent, **it was openly admitted by the relevant defense secretary, Robert McNamara, that in fact the gap had been entirely in favor of the U.S.** Similar, if less infamous episodes recurred featuring bombers, tanks, ships, anti-ballistic missiles and, most comprehensively, defense budgets themselves.

Embarrassing realities, such as serious shortcomings in our putative enemies capabilities, have generally been kept out of sight of the taxpayers. Equally, explosive cost overruns and technical disasters generate, at most, short term scandals. Pleas to cut the defense budget have rarely yielded much of a political dividend. Indeed, in former days, the very size of the budget, irrespective of its components, was touted as a necessary part of our deterrent. One of the more successful gaps of the cold war years was the greater size of the Soviet defense budget. **The Soviets didnt announce how much they were spending on defense** (even if they knew the real cost themselves, which is dubious); so the figure publicized by the military industrial complex was based on an ersatz calculation of the presumed cost to the Soviets of duplicating U.S. programs and systems. I.E., the cost of a Soviet swing-wing bomber would be assessed on the basis of the cost of a similar U.S. effort. Therefore, as Ernie Fitzgerald, the consummate Pentagon whistleblower of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, once observed, every time the B-1 bomber has a cost overrun, the Soviet defense budget goes up! In other words, the more dollars we wasted, the more dangerous the other side became, which justified our wasting even more dollars, and so on.

 George Tenet (former director of CIA): he missed 9/11--and here he looks at the camera and states We do not torture. We do not torture. We do not torture. We do not torture.  

Obviously, there are many other examples--James Clapper, Bill Clinton (etc)...but this interview on *60 minutes* takes the cake as far as Im concerned.  Tenet twists and turns in his chair and repeatedly tells whopper after whopper--all while attempting to get publicity for his book!!!

(I would have linked the full cbs interview if I wasnt so *opposed* to cbs--but I would encourage you to watch it)

 from Page 84 of *The Commission: The Uncensored History of the 9/11 Investigation* by Philip Shenon (2008):

The offices were in a seemingly undistinguished nine-floor federal building between the White House and Georgetown. **The building was secretly owned and operated by the CIA**, used as downtown office space by the agency. It was ideal for the commission because it qualified as a so-called SCIF, the acronym for secure compartmentalized information facility, which meant that it had security measures that allowed for the storage of highly classified documents. Apart from witnesses called to private interviews from the commission, only people with security clearances would be allowed to enter the commission's offices; all cell phones and other electronic devices had to be left at the door. Each of the staff members at K Street was provided with two computer hard drives--one for classified information, one for unclassified information.

-------------------

The CIA has already gone to great lengths to cover up the torture  and the unreliability of the testimony published by the 9/11 Commission.

The CIA has blocked release of the Senates torture report for years. In addition, it has taken many other actions to try to keep the lid on the torture program.

For example, the CIA videotaped the interrogation of 9/11 suspects, but falsely told the 9/11 Commission that there were no videotapes or other records of the interrogations, and then illegally destroyed all of the tapes and transcripts of the interrogations.

9/11 Commission co-chairs Thomas Keane and Lee Hamilton wrote:

*Those who knew about those videotapes  and did not tell us about them  obstructed our investigation*.

Government officials decided not to inform a lawfully constituted body, created by Congress and the president, to investigate one the greatest tragedies to confront this country. We call that obstruction.

(And **the chairs of both the 9/11 Commission and the Official Congressional Inquiry into 9/11 said that Soviet-style government minders obstructed the investigation into 9/11 by intimidating witnesses**. We believe that some of the minders were from the CIA.)

--------------

The committees preference was for the CIA to turn over all responsive documents to the committees office, as had been done in previous committee investigations.

Director Panetta proposed an alternative arrangement: to provide literally millions of pages of operational cables, internal emails, memos, and other documents pursuant to the committees document requests at a secure location in Northern Virginia. We agreed, but insisted on several conditions and protections to ensure the integrity of this congressional investigation.

Per an exchange of letters in 2009, then-Vice Chairman Bond, then-Director Panetta, and I agreed in an exchange of letters that the CIA was to provide a stand-alone computer system with a network drive segregated from CIA networks for the committee that would only be accessed by information technology personnel at the CIAwho would not be permitted to share information from the system with other [CIA] personnel, except as otherwise authorized by the committee.

It was this computer network that, notwithstanding our agreement with Director Panetta, was searched by the CIA this past January, and once before which I will later describe.

In addition to **demanding that the documents produced for the committee be reviewed at a CIA facility**, the CIA also insisted on conducting a multi-layered review of every responsive document before providing the document to the committee. This was to ensure the CIA did not mistakenly provide documents unrelated to the CIAs Detention and Interrogation Program or provide documents that the president could potentially claim to be covered by executive privilege.

http://cryptome.org/2014/03/feinstein-14-0311.pdf 














 

...the CIAs torture program ended up deceiving the 9/11 Commission. Specifically, the 9/11 Commission Report was largely based on third-hand accounts of what tortured detainees said, with two of the three parties in the communication being government employees. The 9/11 Commissioners were not allowed to speak with the detainees, or even their interrogators. Instead, they got their information third-hand. The Commission itself didnt really trust the interrogation testimonyyet published it as if it were Gospel.

New York Times investigative reporter Philip Shenon noted in a 2009 essay in Newsweek that the 9/11 Commission Report was unreliable because most of the information was based on the statements of tortured detainees.

As NBC News reported:

* Much of the 9/11 Commission Report was based upon the testimony of people who were tortured.

* At least four of the people whose interrogation figured in the 9/11 Commission Report have claimed that they told interrogators information as a way to stop being tortured.

* One of the Commissions main sources of information was tortured until he agreed to sign a confession that he was NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO READ.

* The 9/11 Commission itself doubted the accuracy of the torture confessions, and yet kept their doubts to themselves.

The CIA has already gone to great lengths to cover up the torture  and the unreliability of the testimony published by the 9/11 Commission.

John Brennan, the director of the CIA, said the claims by members of the Senate intelligence committee were spurious and wholly unsupported by the facts, and went as far as suggesting the committee itself may have been guilty of wrongdoing.

The battle stems from a hotly contested report into the use of torture by the CIA in the interrogations it carried out after 9/11, whose conclusions are so explosive that it has yet to be declassified, despite exhortations from the White House that a summary should be published. 

Earlier on Wednesday reports surfaced that the CIA inspector general had opened an inquiry, said to have been referred to the justice department, into claims that CIA employees had acted improperly. Suggestions that the CIA had monitored the computer networks of committee staffers had shocked the senators that sit on the panel. Some observers believe that such actions might be criminal.

Senator Mark Udall, a member of the committee who has been vocal in his critism of the CIA, had earlier written to Barack Obama alleging that the president knew about the unprecedented action carried out by the agency.

So, in light of today's article regarding the CIA spying on U.S. Senators investigating the torture allegations--what do you think happened to the 9/11 Commission staff???

---------------

The CIA Inspector Generals Office has asked the Justice Department to investigate allegations of malfeasance at the spy agency in connection with a yet-to-be released Senate Intelligence Committee report into the CIAs secret detention and interrogation program, McClatchy has learned.

The criminal referral may be related to what several knowledgeable people said was CIA monitoring of computers used by Senate aides to prepare the study. The monitoring may have violated an agreement between the committee and the agency.

 Phase 1 means canceling your cable--because cnn, fox, cbs, abc, nbc all still get paid (even if you don't watch them). All MSM webpages and newspapers would be boycotted as well--they have FAILED us and do not deserve our money or support. If there was a widespread boycott the MSM would start paying attention to us!!! This seems even more important now that we are no longer FREE to assemble without fearing our own government SPYING on us.

Phase 2 demands an independent investigation of 9/11 and all of the crimes which surround it including the financial and war crimes of the Bush/Cheney administration. The hearings must be open and under oath--no hiding behind closed doors. We, the People deserve to know our true history--in fact, we have PAID for it with our tax dollars and our soldiers lives. 

Phase 3 will lead where the evidence points.

The aircraft corporations who had garnered enormous profits during the war on the back of government contracts had discovered by 1947 that **peace was ruinous**. Despite initial high hopes, the commercial marketplace was proving a far harsher and less accommodating environment than that of wartime, especially as there were far more companies than required by the peacetime economy. Orders from the civilian airline industry never lived up to expectations while efforts to diversify into other products, including dishwashers and stainless steel coffins, proved disappointing and costly.

Something had to be done. In the spring of 1948 senior officials in the Truman Administration, including Secretary of Defense James Forrestal, suddenly began warning that the Soviets were on the brink of unleashing a surprise military attack against Western Europe. There was **no evidence** that the Soviets had any such intentions, a point, as declassified documents now make clear, that was well known to the senior officials. In fact Stalin, the Soviet leader, was enjoining the powerful western European communist parties from any revolutionary action and refusing to aid the Greek communists in their civil war against the U.S.-backed government.

This cause (need for stimulus in the aerospace industry) and effect (war scare leading to sharp increase in defense appropriations) was pithily summed up at the time by Lawrence D. Bell, President of the Bell Aircraft Corporation: As soon as there is a war scare, there is a lot of money available. And so it proved. The aircraft procurement budget soared **57**% as the overall Pentagon procurement budget exploded by almost **600** percent from less than $6 billion in 1947 to more than $35 billion in 1948 (in contemporary 2011 dollars). The industry, not to mention powerful institutions linked to its fortunes, such as **major banks**, was saved from collapse.

Apart from a brief relapse pending the outbreak of the Korean war in 1950, war scares, otherwise known as **threat inflation** would thereafter be a regular feature of the U.S. political and economic landscape. It mattered little what the Soviet enemy was actually doing, or in a position to do. All that was required was for an announcement that intelligence had revealed an ominous gap between U.S. and Soviet capabilities, and the money flowed. The missile gap on which John F. Kennedy rode to victory in 1960 yielded an immediate fifteen percent hike in defense spending. Years after the money had been appropriated and spent, it was openly admitted by the relevant defense secretary, Robert McNamara, that in fact the gap had been entirely in favor of the U.S. Similar, if less infamous episodes recurred featuring bombers, tanks, ships, anti-ballistic missiles and, most comprehensively, defense budgets themselves.

Embarrassing realities, such as serious shortcomings in our putative enemies capabilities, have generally been kept out of sight of the taxpayers. Equally, explosive cost overruns and technical disasters generate, at most, short term scandals. Pleas to cut the defense budget have rarely yielded much of a political dividend. Indeed, in former days, the very size of the budget, irrespective of its components, was touted as a necessary part of our deterrent. One of the more successful gaps of the cold war years was the greater size of the Soviet defense budget. The Soviets didnt announce how much they were spending on defense (even if they knew the real cost themselves, which is dubious); so the figure publicized by the military industrial complex was based on an ersatz calculation of the presumed cost to the Soviets of duplicating U.S. programs and systems. I.E., the cost of a Soviet swing-wing bomber would be assessed on the basis of the cost of a similar U.S. effort. Therefore, as Ernie Fitzgerald, the consummate Pentagon whistleblower of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, once observed, every time the B-1 bomber has a cost overrun, the Soviet defense budget goes up! In other words, the more dollars we wasted, the more dangerous the other side became, which justified our wasting even more dollars, and so on.

 It's been 50 years since JFK/MLK/RFK were fucking whacked--the USG is still holding 1,000's of records...

It's been 70+ years since WWII--the USG is still holding 1,000's of files on Operation Paperclip, dropping nukes on Japan, and even the Pearl Harbor event which began the U.S. entry into the war...

It's been almost 100 fucking years since the 1920 Wall Street bombing--yet the USG has still NOT released the FBI records that Hoover racked up...

**SO DO YOU REALLY THINK THE USG WILL RELEASE 9/11 RECORDS**??? 


































 1. President Truman created the CIA in 1947--but he also approved a secret codicil in the Marshall Plan of 1948 which allowed the CIA to ransack at least 5% of the $16.5 Billion the plan was given to rebuild 16 cities in Europe and 3 in Asia. The amount the CIA received was at least $680 million--big money back in those days, but it also helped spread their political slush money around the world. Truman was quite naive when it came to the CIA--his early director appointees exited the agency quickly. Truman exhibited his reservations about the CIA 15 years later: exactly one month after JFK was whacked he wrote an editorial in the Washington Post seriously questioning the activities of the CIA:
"For some time I have been disturbed by the way CIA has been diverted from its original assignment. It has become an operational and at times a policy-making arm of the Government. This has led to trouble and may have compounded our difficulties in several explosive areas." 
http://www.maebrussell.com/Prouty/Harry%20Truman's%20CIA%20article.html

2. Eisenhower warns of the Military Industrial Complex in his final statement as President. He also spoke the words "I want to resign" after being caught in a CIA lie about U2 flights over USSR. Eisenhower was a WWII war hero with NO political experience. He appointed Allen Dulles as director of central intelligence and his brother J.F. Dulles as secretary of state. The U.S., in short order, overthrew Iran in 1953 and Guatemala in 1954. Eisenhower also OK'd the assassinations of Patrice Lumumba and Fidel Castro on the same day. http://lippard.blogspot.com/2007/08/brief-history-of-cia-1953-1961.html So--to recap--that's 2 presidents, and BOTH of them definitely fucking felt betrayed by the MIC...we all know what happened to the 3rd, JFK...

3. JFK was whacked--most likely with the CIA leading the pack: 
The Secret Service stood down.
Dallas and Texas law enforcement stood down.
Military intelligence, which is normally enrolled to provide presidential security, stood down.
The FBI stood down.
These elements opened the door to the assassination, but did not have the resources to deliver the shooters and the complicated cover story and witness elimination program that followed.
Corrupt elements of the CIA and their long term friends and colleagues in organized crime did.
And they did it because their very survival was at stake. http://www.veteranstoday.com/2013/11/21/jfk-assassination-the-death-of-hope/

4. So out of the first 3 presidents in the post-WWII era: Truman regretted creating the CIA, Eisenhower was glad to retire because of the CIA/MIC bullshit; and JFK was fucking DEAD. Next up: LBJ. Somehow he found the time to sell his Halliburton stock on 11-22-63--but don't worry he still made $6 million in General Dynamics stock (about $60 million in today's dollars) after he amped up the war in Vietnam. In Octorber 1964, Martin Luther King, Jr earned a Nobel Peace Prize for his non-violent campaign against racism--MLK was the youngest man to receive the prize. Unfortunately, MLK also received a blackmail letter sent by the FBI--the letter also called for MLK to commit suicide and the content of the letter is still partially redacted to this day. In April of 1967 MLK began to vociferously oppose the war in Vietnam. Operation Minaret was run by the NSA and placed MLK, Whitney Young, U.S. Senators, anti-war protestors, Muhammad Ali--and even journalists under surveillance. The NSA had been created in 1952--by the mid-60's they were already shredding the U.S. Constitution. In April, 1968 MLK was assassinated--there is now a great deal of evidence which points towards the FBI and the U.S. military being the assassins. Before America could catch it's breath--just 4 months later-- Robert Kennedy was assassinated, too. RFK had been leading in the democratic party race for the presidential election. RFK posed a double threat because he was speaking out against Vietnam--but he might also run an actual investigation into his brother's killing if RFK had been elected. America was caught in a useless war, it's leaders were being shot down, the public was protesting at the White House and the Pentagon. LBJ, in one of his last interviews at the White House, admitted to Walter Cronkite that he thought there might have been a conspiracy to kill JFK. Like the Warren Commission, the truth was kept from the public and the footage wouldn't air until after LBJ's own death. 

4. Nixon gets caught up in Watergate--an obvious CIA set-up. Why would Nixon send known CIA operatives to break-in to DNC headquarters and allow them to do so in such sloppy fashion? How does ONE security guard catch FIVE burglars? Why would "professional" burglars carry so many direct links to the CIA and the White House? http://www.salon.com/2012/05/05/watergates_final_mystery/

5. Carter is undercut by Reagan's plot to free the Iranian hostages (Reagan's VP was GHW Bush--a former CIA director). Reagan breaks his own rule: "We do not negotiate with terrorists"...before he even enters the White House:
But its how Gates began his meteoric rise in the U.S. intelligence community during the Reagan years that has remained most cloaked in mystery. As a young CIA official in 1980, Gates was implicated in secret maneuvers to sabotage President Jimmy Carters negotiations to free 52 U.S. hostages then held in Iran, a failure by Carter that doomed his reelection. Gates was identified as one of the participants in a key October 1980 meeting in Paris allegedly also involving William Casey, who was then Reagans campaign director; George H.W. Bush, a former CIA director and then-Reagans vice presidential running mate; Iranian emissary Mehdi Karrubi; and Israeli intelligence officers, including Ari Ben-Menashe who later testified under oath about what he witnessed.http://consortiumnews.com/2013/06/08/second-thoughts-on-october-surprise/

6. Reagan/Bush manage to cover up Iran-Contra. CIA/military fingerprints all over this one. If the truth had come out--GHWB would most likely NOT have been elected President (and the republicans would have been seriously wounded in next election). http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB2/nsaebb2.htm

7. GHW Bush is President--U.S. goes to war with Iraq. In re-election campaign Ross Perot mysteriously decides to withdraw from the election (was he threatened?). He then re-enters which splits the vote--and Clinton is elected.

8. Clinton--was the whole Monica Lewinsky scandal a CIA-NSA-neocon operation to assure republican victory in the next election? $40 million spent to investigate. As the impeachment vote is taking place in the House of Representatives--the Speaker (a republican) resigns due to his own sexual dalliances--was this all designed to insure a republican victory in the upcoming elections?

9. GW Bush/Cheney elected--U.S. goes to war with Afghanistan and Iraq. $13 million spent to investigate 9/11 while TRILLIONS are spent on the MIC...

10. Rumors swirl that Obama told his donors "I don't want to end up like Martin Luther King." Press fails to even ask him if the rumor is true. Is the President of the United States of America being controlled by the CIA-NSA-DoD??? http://mondoweiss.net/2013/06/reneged-progressive-promises.html

 Full Letter: http://consortiumnews.com/2014/01/07/nsa-insiders-reveal-what-went-wrong/

------------------

"The sadder reality, Mr. President, is that NSA itself had enough information to prevent 9/11, but chose to sit on it rather than share it with the FBI or CIA. We know; we were there. We were witness to the many bureaucratic indignities that made NSA at least as culpable for pre-9/11 failures as are other U.S. intelligence agencies...

...My first day on the job at NSA was 9/11. I was immediately charged as the lead NSA executive to find and deploy the best technology at NSA for the fight against terrorism....

...Thats where I found the pre- and post-9/11 intelligence from NSA monitoring of some of the hijackers as they planned the attacks of 9/11 had not been shared outside NSA. This includes critical pre-9/11 intelligence on al-Qaeda, even though it had been worked on by NSA analysts. I learned, for example, that in early 2001 NSA had produced a critical long-term analytic report unraveling the entire heart of al-Qaeda and associated movements. That report also was not disseminated outside of NSA.

Make no mistake. That data and the analytic report could have, should have prevented 9/11...

...In short, when confronted with the prospect of fessing up, NSA chose instead to obstruct the 9/11 congressional investigation, play dumb, and keep the truth buried, including the fact that it knew about all inbound and outbound calls to the safe house switchboard in Yemen. NSAs senior leaders took me off the task because they realized  belatedly, for some reason  that I would not take part in covering up the truth about how much NSA knew but did not share.

When the 9/11 Commission hearings began, Director Hayden chortled at executive staff meetings over the fact that the FBI and CIA were feeling the heat for not having prevented 9/11. This was particularly difficult for me to sit through, for I was aware that NSA had been able to cover up its own culpability by keeping investigators, committees, and commissions away from the truth." 









 1. **Edward Snowden**: "My name is Ed Snowden, I'm 29 years old. I worked for Booz Allen Hamilton as an infrastructure analyst for NSA in Hawaii...I've been a systems engineer, systems administrator, senior adviser for the Central Intelligence Agency, solutions consultant, and a telecommunications informations system officer." (from first interview with Glenn Greenwald http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/jun/09/nsa-whistleblower-edward-snowden-interview-video)

2. **U.S. Marine--Blaine Cooper:**  "Hi, Mr. McCain. I mean this with all due respect (to you) as an elected official of our country. We, the people want you to be representative of the people--and for this great nation. But for far too long now the rest of Congress, including the executive branch along with the judicial and legislative--have turned your back on the American people and their core values and principles. i can say, with great confidence, and speak on behalf of all Americans that your actions against this country are treasonous. All of you--against the will of the American people--have aided and abetted the enemy. You and the rest of Congress, including the President of the United States, have went against the will of your people in Syria. Regardless of your position and vote (whether it is a "yes" or "no") is still a political smokescreen. I Believe wholeheartedly you do not care about the will and well-being of America or it's people. You lie to the American people about chemical attacks in Syria. The American people know that it was our government that is most responsible. There is strong evidence, including video, that these attacks were carried out by Al Qaeda and you advocate starting war, maybe even world war, by taking the same attack and blaming it on Assad. President Barack Hussein Obama has been supporting terrorism. The United States has been funding and aiding organizations including the Muslim Brotherhood and Al Qaeda for many years now--the same enemy we're supposed to be defeating on the battlefield. At least one country in this world stood up against this government terrorism that you guys support in Egypt...(cont.)

3. **Russ Tice**: "They went after high ranking military officers. They went after members of congress. The Senate and the House - especially on the intelligence committees, and on the armed services committees and judicial. But they went after other ones too. They went after lawyers and law firms. Heaps of lawyers and law firms. They went after judges. One of the judges is now sitting on the supreme court that I had his wiretap information in my hand. Two are former FISA court judges. They went after state department officials. They went after people in the executive service that were part of the White House - their own people! They went after anti-war groups. They went after US companies that do international business around the world. They went after US banking firms and financial firms that do international business. They went after NGOs like the red cross and people like that that go overseas and do humanitarian work. They went after a few anti-war civil rights groups...Now here's the big one...June 20th interview on Boiling Frogs...http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPyxeqcCjkc (full 1hr+ radio interview)

4. **Cornell West:** "We elected a black president and that means we are less racist now than we used to be. That's beautiful. But when you look at the prison industrial complex and the new Jim Crow: levels of massive unemployment and the decrepit unemployment system, indecent housing: white supremacy is still operating in the US, even with a brilliant black face in a high place called the White House. He is a brilliant, charismatic black brother. He's just too tied to Wall Street. And at this point he is a war criminal. You can't meet every Tuesday with a killer list and continually have drones drop bombs. You can do that once or twice and say: 'I shouldn't have done that, I've got to stop.' But when you do it month in, month out, year in, year out  that's a pattern of behaviour. I think there is a chance of a snowball in hell that he will ever be tried, but I think he should be tried and I said the same about George Bush. These are war crimes. We suffer in this age from an indifference toward criminality and a callousness to catastrophe when it comes to poor and working people."http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/may/13/cornel-west-they-say-i-am-unamerican

5. **Richard Belzer**: "...not wanting to go through with the Bay of Pigs and wanting to get out of Vietnam--that's why he was murdered. Because there's so much money that was made in Vietnam--tons of money--and that prolonged the war without reason. Eisenhower warned us about the military industrial complex and Kennedy understood it. He came in office and inherited the Bay of Pigs from Eisenhower and the CIA and some of the people in the military lied to Kennedy about what would happen in Cuba. So the reach of the CIA has gone beyond it's charter. He fired Allan Dulles, the head of the CIA. He said I'm going to shatter the CIA into thousands of pieces because they went beyond their charter. **They're supposed to be covert**--they're not supposed to be starting wars. Even Harry Truman was appalled at what was going on because some elements of his government were getting nazi war criminals into our country illegally--subverting the will of the Nuremberg trials--because we wanted the neo-nazi scientists. There's a lot of dark stuff--but it's in the public domain. There's thousands of pages that can't be released until 2075. But there's an interesting thing in 2014--England's statute of limitations on certain things can come out. And what we're going to find out from that is Allan Dulles--who was the CIA head fired by Kennedy--was later on the Warren Commission...Allan Dulles should have been hung for treason for what he did during World War Two. He worked for the nazis throughout the war--hid money for American and English bankers. He was one of the most contemptable people ever--Allan Dulles." (last 3 minutes of 15 minute May, 2013 interview: http://www.politico.com/multimedia/video/2013/05/richard-belzer-book-tackles-jfk-conspiracies.html)

6. **Thomas Drake**: "From the recent disclosures of Edward Snowden, the US government has routinely violated on a vast industrial scale the Constitutional protections afforded its own citizens, while also disregarding the internal integrity of other states and the fundamental rights of non-US citizens. I know. Because I was eyewitness to the very foundations of a persistent surveillance state greatly expanded in the deepest of secrecy right after 9/11. I was there at the beginning." (Must See 16 minute speech before EU Parliament Sept. 30, 3013...speech/full transcript at:http://www.whistleblower.org/blog/44-2013/2981-nsa-whistleblower-thomas-drake-statement-before-eu-parliament-committee)

7. **Paul Sperry:** "The Saudis deny any role in 9/11, but the CIA in one memo reportedly found incontrovertible evidence that Saudi government officials  not just wealthy Saudi hardliners, but high-level diplomats and intelligence officers employed by the kingdom  helped the hijackers both financially and logistically. The intelligence files cited in the report directly implicate the Saudi embassy in Washington and consulate in Los Angeles in the attacks, making 9/11 not just an act of terrorism, but an act of war."
http://nypost.com/2013/12/15/inside-the-saudi-911-coverup/

8. **Tegan Mathis**: "America's national security leaders, who had run foreign policy since WWII, decided to get rid of President Kennedy. In early 1963, President Kennedy -- in an effort to cut the CIA leadership and the Joint Chiefs out of the loop -- handed all responsibility for covert operations in Cuba to Army Secretary Cyrus Vance (a civilian). Army Colonel Alexander Haig became Secretary Vance's liaison to the Cuban Brigade...The official version of Haig's service under Vance says he provided social services for the Cuban Brigade members. (He provided them with employment and educational opportunities.) But this is just a cover story. In reality, Haig was an intelligence officer. His duty was to train the Cuban Brigade members to oust Fidel Castro. Yes, that's right, Al Haig wasn't really a social worker. Surprise, surprise! ...But here's the thing: In addition to training the Brigade members to oust Fidel Castro, Haig trained a select few of them to oust President Kennedy. Here's the other thing: Every stage of the operation was supervised and funded by Attorney General Bobby Kennedy, right down to the creating of a legacy for the patsy, Lee Oswald. Oswald was evidently supposed to travel to Cuba to play a peripheral role in the anti-Castro coup plan. Bobby Kennedy unwittingly had a hand in almost every aspect his own brother's assassination. Because the 1963 plot to oust Castro was an ultra-secret operation, so is the plot they used to murder President Kennedy. The two plots are one in the same. In other words, the truth about the John F. Kennedy assassination is still, to this very day, buried beneath the plot to oust Fidel Castro. (For those of you familiar with this subject matter, Lamar Waldron and Thom Hartmann refer to the secret plot to oust Castro as the "Almeida coup plan," but they don't understand that the plot was actually used to kill Kennedy.)...Howard Hunt had recruited the Cuban Brigade members for the CIA dating back to 1959. When Vance put Haig in charge of the Cuban Brigade in 1963, he also put him in charge of Hunt. But Hunt, like Haig, had turned against the President. When Hunt was linked to the Watergate break-in in 1972, all hell broke loose. By then, Haig had become a top aide to President Nixon. And all or most of the Watergate burglars had worked with or for Haig and Hunt in 1963, some of them on the plot to murder President Kennedy. This is what Watergate was really about. With the help of fake journalists like Bob Woodward, Haig led all of the attention away from Hunt and the CIA and towards Richard Nixon's Reelection Committee (or CREEP). In the end, Haig forced Nixon out, and Ford issued an all-encompassing pardon that took all of the attention off Haig and his fellow assassins. That's really all there is to it. (Tegan Mathis wrote: *Against Them: How   Why Alexander Haig, Bob Woodward, Donald Rumsfeld,   Richard Cheney Covered Up the JFK Assassination in the Wake of the Watergate Break-In*...from comments posted in May 9, 2013 article by Russ Baker... http://whowhatwhy.com/2013/05/09/jfk-rfk-mlk-the-questions-remain/)

9. **Preston James, Ph D**: The sealed executive sessions of the HSCA should be released. These were the highly classified executive sessions with folks like Marita Lorenz and Frank Sturgis of OP40 who testified and provided numerous photos and docs. They were given immunity in exchange for cooperating. The records provided included a photo of the Op40 crew at the Motel the night before with Jack Ruby and much more. Ask Gaeton Fonzi, he knows but Ill bet he wont admit it...When Frank Sturgis was arrested in NYC right before the HSCA Hearings, he made one phone call, supposed to Gaeton Fonzi, who then contacted infamous mob attorney Frank Nelson who came and bailed Sturgis out of jail the next morning. The executive sessions boxed and sealed evidence is filled with so much smoking gun evidence that it would have brought down the whole US intel system and much of the USG, which basically was transformed into a huge criminal syndicate by those who murdered JFK. What is in the sealed files?  That the JFK Assassination was a deep black USD covert operation run right out of the JCS with LBJ, Bush1, Nixon, J. Edgar Mary, Lemnitzer, Lansdale, E Howard Hunt, Phillips, and CIA/Op40 doing the shooting with numerous others ops and mafia brought in to provide false leads. If the boxes were opened now and released 100% as is, they would still probably bring down much of the USG and American Intel, since many of the same power control groups who did it are still in power and are completely illegitimate. One of the boxes contains a signed finding by LBJ that JFK was a clear threat to US national security. And there are numerous videos taken from Dealey Plaza which show what really happened. These videos are the real deal, not morphed and edited like the faked Zapruder film.

---------------------

These quotes shocked me and made me question what the TRUTH really is. 2013 was filled with Snowden revelations--but there were quotes from other veteran NSA whistleblowers as well which corroborated what Snowden was saying. It was also 50 years since JFK being assassinated--these quotes about JFK made me think about the possibilities...

edit: might be best just to type your favorite quote and let them be upvoted...be a good idea to double-check and see if they were actually written/spoken in 2013 (all of these definitely were--the date can be found in the link)...

 "Regarding possible conspiracies, to this day I have serious doubts that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. I certainly have doubts that he was motivated to do that by himself. Im not sure if anybody else was involved. I dont go down that road, with respect to the grassy knoll theory and all of that, but I have serious questions about whether they got to the bottom of Lee Harvey Oswald. I think he was inspired somewhere by something, but I cant pin anything down on that. Ive never spent a lot of time on it. But I think, after a certain period of time, and that period of time may well have passed, **it is totally appropriate for a country like the United States to open up the files** on whatever history can be shed light on. I think that is appropriate. It has to be done in the right way, by the right entities or people, but certainly by a valid historian or for some valid analysis; I think that everybody would benefit."

 "Intelligence is a sacred cow...The CIA isn't worth a damn." --Nixon

Nixon fired Richard Helms on Nov. 20, 1972 but allowed Helms to stay on until March 1973. On Nov. 21, Nixon appointed his own man to the CIA--James Schlesinger, and told him to "Get rid of the clowns. What use are they? They've got 40,000 people over there reading newspapers."

Schlesinger then sent out a memo at the Agency part of which read:

I have ordered all senior operating officials of this Agency to report to me immediately on any activities now going on, or that have gone on in the past, which might be construed to be outside the legislative charter of this Agency.

I hereby direct every person presently employed by CIA to report to me on any such activities of which he has knowledge. I invite all ex-employees to do the same. Anyone who has such knowledge should call...and say that he wishes to tell me about "activities outside CIA's charter." 









 "Were the Soviet Union to sink tomorrow under the waters of the ocean, the American militaryindustrial complex would have to remain, substantially unchanged, until some other adversary *could be invented*. Anything else would be an unacceptable shock to the American economy." (emphasis mine)

--George F. Kennan in preface of Norman Cousins's 1987 book The Pathology of Power

The implications of this quote definitely startled me a bit when I first came across these words about a year ago. After looking up his wikipedia and learning Kennan was a career diplomat and historian--he seemed to be an influential insider who helped mold the Truman Doctrine and thrusted the U.S. into the Cold War. But Kennan was more than a player in creating U.S. foreign policy after WWII--he was actually at vital meetings that helped create a brutal, under-handed agency mindframe that was often out of control.

It wasn't until I read **Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA** (2007) that Kennan lost the gentlemanly diplomatic facade and was exposed as something quite sinister. The book contains a quote from a 1948 secret report which was sent to the U.S. State Dept, the White House and the Pentagon in which Kennan called for "the inauguration of organized political warfare". Another memo sent to Sec. of Defense Forrestal called for the formation of "a guerrilla warfare corps". Obviously, these are much different purposes than what the original function of the CIA was stated to be--an intelligence agency updating the President on world events.

Even if you know some of the sordid details of the CIA--Tim Weiner's book *Legacy of Ashes* will make it quite clear that Kennan's memos were taken seriously--and if only HALF of what Tim Weiner writes is true then America has been subjected to the biggest CON JOB ever. The book weighs in at 809 pages with almost 200 pages of notes/sources and much of the info is from the CIA's own files. It begins with the end of WWII and proceeds chronologically without getting bogged down in code names. Direct quotes are used often, sometimes they even jump off the page: "We killed thousands of Communists, even though half of them probably didn't know what Communism meant. (CIA pilot Al Pope)".

After reading the first 60 pages it's stunning how the CIA was able to disregard all laws and procedures in the U.S. to get initial funding. For the first year or two Wall Street bankers were asked to chip in by sending a million or so overseas--then they could mark a special code on their tax form and write it off. Other familiar names quickly enter the picture--Allan Dulles, John Foster Dulles, Richard Helms, Richard Bissell. The drive for power was matched by the increase in funding--by 1948 the CIA had somehow ransacked 5% of the Marshall Plan money which came out to $680 million over 4 years through a secret clause.

So, right from the start, the CIA finances were crooked, Americans--often even the President and congress-- unaware. The stated mission of intelligence gathering was taking a backseat for much higher stakes of assassination, funding/training militia groups--laws simply did not apply in any way to the CIA. The Agency was gambling and it's actions were often sloppy and self-defeating. The enemy was anyone who didn't openly reject communism and bend over for American business. From Japan to Iran to Guatemala to the Congo--the Agency poured in cash to political parties and journalists. If that didn't work the proper militias or henchmen were supplied with weapons and hired.

As I pondered the first three chapters of Legacy of Ashes two questions raced through my mind: can the U.S. possibly be much deeper in debt than the $17 Trillion they are telling us? Secondly, could 9/11 have been perpetrated by the CIA to destroy (permanently) financial records and to further fund the defense/intelligence sectors?

The reason I ask these questions is because of the enormous economic fraud from the inception of the CIA which was perpetrated by the Dulles brothers and the Wall Street bankers who backed the Agency. On top of that is the fact that the CIA is but one of a myriad of defense and intelligence arms of the U.S. and you have to question why Americans have not demanded an open audit immediately. Just in the intelligence/homeland security field there are now well over 3,000 government agencies and private contractors churning out over 50,000 reports a year. The Dept. of Defense has no actual audit in recent memory--though there are rumors an audit was made in 1993. No one has ever seen an actual audit for the CIA (let alone the entire defense/intelligence budget). Even today, the CIA's budget total is written on a piece of paper and then shown to a senior senator of the Intelligence Committee--no one else (outside of the CIA and possibly the President). Now multiply that process 20 or 30 times for all the other major U.S. Government agencies.

*Legacy of Ashes* proves the President has often been oblivious to the plans being played out by the CIA. Justice has been subverted--every law in the U.S. and internationally has been laughed at and spat upon while the party goes on in CIA mansions around the world. After just one dozen years of existence the CIA had played the politics of fear so successfully that Eisenhower was giving the OK to assassinate Lumumba (leader of Congo) and Fidel Castro in just one meeting. There's a reason they won't release most of the files for 50 or 60 years--because the citizens of the U.S. and the world would demand an actual investigation (one which doesn't involve puppets).

The dangerous threat these defense and intelligence agencies present to freedom and democracy--especially when added to the Edward Snowden revelations--should stop you in your tracks. I highly suggest you read the book and seriously consider the implications of these agencies being allowed such an extreme lack of accountability. In the end even Presidents Truman and Eisenhower had many regrets over their dealings with the Agency--Truman regretted creating it and Eisenhower even blurted out "I would like to resign" after he had been burned (and exposed) by a CIA operation which involved the U2 spy plane.

 do you honestly think that after 50 years the American press is going to tell you the TRUTH???

there may be journalists who tried--but in the end it is the editors   publishers decision what to print.

we know from Russ Tice that the editors just run to the government to get approval--so QUIT watching American media--it's PROPAGANDA.

there is a reason "The Men Who Killed Kennedy" was made in England.

there is a reason "The Dark Side of JFK" was published in Europe.

the TRUTH cuts too deep. the TRUTH shakes the walls at the the three letter agencies.

the TRUTH will NOT be revealed on cnn or cbs or abc...

 "The NSA must be shattered into a billion pieces and it's leaders who violated the law immediately brought to justice. It must be defunded and **the thievery must stop**. Over 3,000 government agencies and private contractors have **screwed the taxpayers** out of TRILLIONS since 9/11. On top of that, the American taxpayer has been funding Industrial Espionage for private corporations. As a **Final Insult**, millions of Americans have repeatedly been spied on and victimized without due process of law being followed." 




 For example: how did the government cover up the JFK plot?

EASY--they intimidated witnesses and monitored everyone's phone   mail. Certainly makes killing those who knew too much a lot easier. Makes "journalists"  much easier to control as well. Covering-up 200 deaths over the next 15 years becomes pretty easy too.

We are finally finding out the lengths the government will go to control us--by spying on Martin Luther King, active U.S. senators, public figures like John Lennon and Muhammad Ali. Even the Smothers Brothers QUIT rather than continue having their work chiseled down every week by the TV censors. I'll bet even Oliver Stone is thinking about WHY he had such a hard time making "Apocalypse Now". No wonder it was so easy for the "film reviewers" to berate and belittle "JFK" when it came out--they most likely had the script for months before seeing the movie.

Then there's the journalists--who have been spied on, harassed and sometimes even killed. From Dorothy Killeen to Michael Hastings--I even recently saw "Dirty Wars" by Jeremy Scahill where he is harassed during the filming of his documentary. Ever wonder why reporters don't "follow the money" into the Pentagon or CIA???

It is becoming clear that the "news" is pure propaganda that is approved ultimately by government agencies--there is NO FREEDOM OF THE PRESS--it is a mirage.  





























 excerpt from washington post/business...

Booz Allen, based in Tysons Corner, has been a local fixture for years, employing thousands and providing management and consulting services to the government, particularly the defense and intelligence agencies. It even sponsored a local golf tournament  the Booz Allen Classic  between 2004 and 2006. It also became a leader among the contractors supplying tens of thousands of intelligence analysts to the government in recent years, including technologists such as Snowden.

Those government contracts, and thousands more like them, in 2008 made Booz Allen a ripe acquisition target for Carlyle Group. It paid **$2.54 billion** for Booz Allen as a deep recession took hold. Fearing the risks of taking on too much debt in the midst of a financial crisis, Carlyle put up **50 percent cash** instead of its normal 30 percent. It borrowed the rest to buy the company, which was then privately held.

Upon the close of the deal, the less profitable international and commercial business was spun off to become Booz   Co., leaving Carlyle with a government-only company. After the split, the new Booz Allen Hamilton established an **incentive-based compensation** structure that gave the remaining partners a stake in the firms success. In effect, said one person close to the deal who was not authorized to speak publicly, **you got to eat what you killed**. http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-06-11/business/39896957_1_carlyle-group-nsa-firm

-----------------------------

excerpt from the guardian june 10, 2013...by julian borger...

**The current director of national intelligence (DNI), James Clapper**, who issued a stinging attack on the intelligence leaks this weekend, is a former Booz Allen executive. The firm's **current vice-chairman, Mike McConnell, was DNI under the George W Bush administration**. He worked for the Virginia-based company before taking the job, and returned to the firm after leaving it. The company website says McConnell is responsible for its "rapidly expanding cyber business".

**James Woolsey, a former CIA director** was also a Booz Allen vice-president, and Melissa Hathaway, another former company executive also once worked as the top aide on cybersecurity to McConnell when he was DNI. The company headquarters in the leafy Washington suburb of McLean in northern Virginia, close to CIA headquarters and home to former and current intelligence officers.

Snowden's decision to reveal his identity as a computer systems administrator for Booz Allen Hamilton, directly handling National Security Agency IT systems, raises significant image problems for the **$6bn company** and its 25,000-strong staff, which has traded on a bond of trust with sensitive clients, particularly the intelligence establishment. http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/09/booz-allen-hamilton-edward-snowden

 Top 3 JFK free documentaries on youtube...

1. Attorney Mark Lane's 1966 book/film "Rush to Judgement" documents the accounts of about 20 witnesses in Dealey Plaza on 11-22-63. The witnesses all had excellent views of the tragic events, yet, had their testimony ignored by the Warren Commission. By the time the documentary came out many Americans had been effectively, and continuously, sold the OSWALD MYTH by the repetitious drones of the FBI and Warren Comm. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAnX7atkpyA

2. "The Men Who Killed Kennedy" Parts 1-9 (1988-2003)...While Ken Burns was taking documentary films to new heights by covering the Civil War, Baseball and Jazz, the English produced "TMWKK" series which covers many avenues--some being shocking for their plausibility and others covering aspects which stretch science and imaginations a bit too much. Very telling that this was made in England--and that the last 3 parts were BANNED from American TV. Also notable is the number of witnesses who only speak out as they retire from their jobs--including 16 doctors from Parkland Hospital who all make corroborating statements regarding JFK's wounds. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2agPurqFJk

3. "Evidence of Revision" Parts 1-6 plus extras (2006)."Documents which define history should belong to the public, not private interests"...My favorite Epic Documentary Masterpiece which delves into the assassinations of JFK, MLK and RFK. The film has a wealth of rare, live footage from the days the events occurred as well as info from recently released intelligence files. "E of R" boldly steps into arenas that will challenge your thoughts on the history of American defense/intelligence agencies as they became involved with Vietnam. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBxMJFQd04 ...(Part 6 of "Evidence of Revision" is 2hrs8mins--some versions cut off the end)...

 "Informed sources in Washington have been leaking stories about the reorganization of the Secret Service for months, forever insisting that all that's needed to prevent a repitition of Dallas is more money, more men, more informers...the Secret Service is feeding a special computer the names and data of all known individuals, groups and organizations who might try to kill the president....Jan 1, 1968 should be a red letter day on the calendar. As from that date, presidential assassinations in the U.S. will no longer be practicable--thanks to the all seeing eyes, all hearing ears and divining brain of the magic robot that will start functioning at Secret Service headquarters that day." (from Prologue, page 9)

**"Since these snipers were operating out of a closed area which was controlled by the police, and was a Sheriff's parking lot, they cannot possibly have been there, or have remained undetected, without police connivance."** (page 21)

"Ever since I first accused (Chief of Police) Curry and his Chief of Homicide J. Will Fritz, of having been directly implicated in the JFK murder, I have been waiting to hear from these gentlemen, or at least one of them, through his lawyer, but alas, in vain." (page 22)
"For even greater effect, my British publisher (took out) a two-page spread...which explicitly invited those named in the book to sue him, and me, for libel so the case could at last be aired in a court of law... There is nothing more frustrating in the world than to not be able to get a libel suit out of somebody you've called a murderer to his face. And a presidential murderer, to boot." (page 23)

----------------------------

Deputy Sheriff Roger Craig also writes about this...

**"Let us examine this parking lot. It was leased by Deputy Sheriff B. D. Gossett. He in turn rented parking space by the month to the deputies who worked in the court house, except for official vehicles. I rented one of these spaces from Gossett when I was a dispatcher working days or evenings. I paid Gossett $3.00 per month and was given a key to the lot. An interesting point is that the lot had an iron bar across the only entrance and exit (which were the same). The bar had a chain and lock on it. The only people having access to it were deputies with keys."**

http://www.ratical.org/ratville/JFK/WTKaP.html

Roger Craig's story is a bit painful to read--he was harassed and terrorized by the FBI or the CIA because he was willing to talk to reporters and tell them what he knew...Roger Craig even went a bit further and did some investigative work for Jim Garrison--and in light of the recent NSA/FBI revelations--maybe what he said in his writing will be seen in a new context...

 Harry Truman in Washington Post editorial Dec. 22, 1963...(the editorial only ran in the morning edition--it was pulled from other editions)

For some time I have been disturbed by the way CIA has been diverted from its original assignment. It has become an operational and at times a policy-making arm of the Government. This has led to trouble and may have compounded our difficulties in several explosive areas.

I never had any thought that when I set up the CIA that it would be injected into peacetime cloak and dagger operations. Some of the complications and embarrassment I think we have experienced are in part attributable to the fact that this quiet intelligence arm of the President has been so removed from its intended role that it is being interpreted as a symbol of sinister and mysterious foreign intrigueand a subject for cold war enemy propaganda.

With all the nonsense put out by Communist propaganda about "Yankee imperialism," "exploitive capitalism," "war-mongering," "monopolists," in their name-calling assault on the West, the last thing we needed was for the CIA to be seized upon as something akin to a subverting influence in the affairs of other people.

I well knew the first temporary director of the CIA, Adm. Souers, and the later permanent directors of the CIA, Gen. Hoyt Vandenberg and Allen Dulles. These were men of the highest character, patriotism and integrityand I assume this is true of all those who continue in charge.

But there are now some searching questions that need to be answered. I, therefore, would like to see the CIA be restored to its original assignment as the intelligence arm of the President, and that whatever else it can properly perform in that special fieldand that its operational duties be terminated or properly used elsewhere.
We have grown up as a nation, respected for our free institutions and for our ability to maintain a free and open society. There is something about the way the CIA has been functioning that is casting a shadow over our historic position and I feel that we need to correct it.

 







































 otherwise, how would the U.S. have over 1,000 foreign military bases?

otherwise, why would the U.S. only take military action against smaller countries with inferior armies and weapons?

i may be wrong about the number of foreign military bases--but whatever that number is--we still have a lot of them...even our base in guantanamo is based on stealing and bullying--i think we acquired it  at the end of the Spanish-American War in 1903--the lease may have been signed under duress and does not end (which is illegal) and the payment is $2,000 per year...supposedly, Cuba has cashed only one of these checks and has demanded the lease be torn up ever since.

edit: the contract with cuba was upped to $4,000 in 1934--since then only 1 check has been cashed. 




 1. Comments by **Tegan Mathis** (posted in comment section of an article titled "JFK-RFK-MLK??? The Questions Remain" by Russ Baker on whowhatwhy.com)...

If you want to know the truth about the JFK assassination, here it is:
After the Bay of Pigs, the Berlin Wall, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Limited Test Ban Treaty, the Peace Speech, the orders to withdraw troops from Vietnam, etc., America's national security leaders, who had run foreign policy since WWII, decided to get rid of President Kennedy.
In early 1963, President Kennedy -- in an effort to cut the CIA leadership and the Joint Chiefs out of the loop -- handed all responsibility for covert operations in Cuba to Army Secretary Cyrus Vance (a civilian). Army Colonel Alexander Haig became Secretary Vance's liaison to the Cuban Brigade. The Cuban Brigade was the army of Cuban exiles who carried out the Bay of Pigs operation in 1961.
The official version of Haig's service under Vance says he provided social services for the Cuban Brigade members. (He provided them with employment and educational opportunities.) But this is just a cover story. In reality, Haig was an intelligence officer. His duty was to train the Cuban Brigade members to oust Fidel Castro. Yes, that's right, Al Haig wasn't really a social worker. Surprise, surprise!

But here's the thing: In addition to training the Brigade members to oust Fidel Castro, Haig trained a select few of them to oust President Kennedy.
**Here's the other thing:** Every stage of the operation was supervised and funded by Attorney General Bobby Kennedy, right down to the creating of a legacy for the patsy, Lee Oswald. Oswald was evidently supposed to travel to Cuba to play a peripheral role in the anti-Castro coup plan. Bobby Kennedy unwittingly had a hand in almost every aspect his own brother's assassination.
Because the 1963 plot to oust Castro was an ultra-secret operation, so is the plot they used to murder President Kennedy. The two plots are one in the same. In other words, the truth about the John F. Kennedy assassination is still, to this very day, buried beneath the plot to oust Fidel Castro. (For those of you familiar with this subject matter, Lamar Waldron and Thom Hartmann refer to the secret plot to oust Castro as the "Almeida coup plan," but they don't understand that the plot was actually used to kill Kennedy.)
Howard Hunt had recruited the Cuban Brigade members for the CIA dating back to 1959. When Vance put Haig in charge of the Cuban Brigade in 1963, he also put him in charge of Hunt. But Hunt, like Haig, had turned against the President.

When Hunt was linked to the Watergate break-in in 1972, all hell broke loose. By then, Haig had become a top aide to President Nixon. And all or most of the Watergate burglars had worked with or for Haig and Hunt in 1963, some of them on the plot to murder President Kennedy. This is what Watergate was really about.
With the help of fake journalists like Bob Woodward, Haig led all of the attention away from Hunt and the CIA and towards Richard Nixon's Reelection Committee (or CREEP).
In the end, Haig forced Nixon out, and Ford issued an all-encompassing pardon that took all of the attention off Haig and his fellow assassins.
That's really all there is to it. But if you want to know more, read my book, Against Them: How   Why Alexander Haig, Bob Woodward, Donald Rumsfeld,   Richard Cheney Covered Up the JFK Assassination in the Wake of the Watergate Break-In. Or, if it's easier for you to believe that Alexander Haig was a social worker to the Cuban Brigade, that's cool too.

**2.** Comments by **Preston James, Ph D** (posted in comments of article titled "The JFK War: The Case of Federal Judge John Tunheim" by Dr. James Fetzer on VeteransToday.com)...

Excellent article. The sealed executive sessions of the HSCA should be released. These were the highly classified executive sessions with folks like Marita Lorenz and Frank Sturgis of OP40 who testified and provided numerous photos and docs. They were given immunity in exchange for cooperating. The records provided included a photo of the Op40 crew at the Motel the night before with Jack Ruby and much more. Ask Gaeton Fonzi, he knows but Ill bet he wont admit it.

When Frank Sturgis was arrested in NYC right before the HSCA Hearings, he made one phone call, supposed to Gaeton Fonzi, who then contacted infamous mob attorney Frank Nelson who came and bailed Sturgis out of jail the next morning. The **executive sessions boxed and sealed evidence** is filled with so much smoking gun evidence that it would have brought down the whole US intel system and much of the USG, which basically was transformed into a huge criminal syndicate by those who murdered JFK. What is in the sealed files?

That the JFK Assassination was a deep black USD covert operation run right out of the JCS with LBJ, Bush1, Nixon, J. Edgar Mary, Lemnitzer, Lansdale, E Howard Hunt, Phillips, and CIA/Op40 doing the shooting with numerous others ops and mafia brought in to provide false leads. If the boxes were opened now and released 100% as is, they would still probably bring down much of the USG and American Intel, since many of the same power control groups who did it are still in power and are completely illegitimate. One of the boxes contains a signed finding by LBJ that JFK was a clear threat to US national security. And there are numerous videos taken from Dealey Plaza which show what really happened. These videos are the real deal, not morphed and edited like the faked Zapruder film.

**3.** "...not wanting to go through with the Bay of Pigs and wanting to get out of Vietnam--that's why he was murdered. Because there's so much money that was made in Vietnam--tons of money--and that prolonged the war without reason. Eisenhower warned us about the military industrial complex and Kennedy understood it. He came in office and inherited the Bay of Pigs from Eisenhower and the CIA and some of the people in the military lied to Kennedy about what would happen in Cuba. So the reach of the CIA has gone beyond it's charter. He fired Allan Dulles, the head of the CIA. He said I'm going to shatter the CIA into thousands of pieces because they went beyond their charter. **They're supposed to be covert**--they're not supposed to be starting wars. Even Harry Truman was appalled at what was going on because some elements of his government were getting nazi war criminals into our country illegally--subverting the will of the Nuremberg trials--because we wanted the neo-nazi scientists. There's a lot of dark stuff--but it's in the public domain. There's thousands of pages that can't be released until 2075. But there's an interesting thing in 2014--England's statute of limitations on certain things can come out. And what we're going to find out from that is Allan Dulles--who was the CIA head fired by Kennedy--was later on the Warren Commission...Allan Dulles should have been hung for treason for what he did during World War Two. He worked for the nazis throughout the war--hid money for American and English bankers. He was one of the most contemptable people ever--Allan Dulles."

--**Richard Belzer** in May 10, 2013 politico.com interview with Patrick Gavin promoting his new book *Hit List* (watch last 3 minutes of interview)... 









 "Were the Soviet Union to sink tomorrow under the waters of the ocean, the American military-industrial complex would have to remain, substantially unchanged, *until some other adversary could be invented*. Anything else would be an unacceptable shock to the American economy."

 1. Attorney Mark Lane's 1966 book/film "Rush to Judgement" documents the accounts of about 20 witnesses in Dealey Plaza on 11-22-63. The witnesses all had excellent views of the tragic events, yet, had their testimony ignored by the Warren Commission. By the time the documentary came out many Americans had been effectively, and continuously, sold the OSWALD MYTH by the repetitious drones of the FBI and Warren Comm.

2. "The Men Who Killed Kennedy" Parts 1-9 (1988-2003)...While Ken Burns was taking documentary films to new heights by covering the Civil War, Baseball and Jazz, the English produced "TMWKK" series which covers many avenues--some being shocking for their plausibility and others covering aspects which stretch science and imaginations a bit too much. Very telling that this was made in England--and that the last 3 parts were BANNED from American TV. Also notable is the number of witnesses who only speak out as they retire from their jobs--including 16 doctors from Parkland Hospital who all make corroborating statements regarding JFK's wounds.

3. "Evidence of Revision" Parts 1-6 plus extras (2006)."Documents which define history should belong to the public, not private interests"...My favorite Epic Documentary Masterpiece which delves into the assassinations of JFK, MLK and RFK. The film has a wealth of rare, live footage from the days the events occurred as well as info from recently released intelligence files. "E of R" boldly steps into arenas that will challenge your thoughts on the history of American defense/intelligence agencies as they became involved with Vietnam.

These 3 films expose the shocking events in many ways the American public was unable to see at the time. The public was not allowed to see the Zapruder film until the mid-1970's (there were only still images released until then). Even 50 years later, there is a great deal of files the government still will NOT release--as if 50 YEARS LATER it is still a national security issue. The films often present evidence the JFK assassination was a COUP D'ETAT and an action which allowed the military, intelligence, financial, and energy sectors to expand their will upon the American people--and the world. You might totally disagree with this conclusion--but to NOT view these films (and do other research) would be a short-sighted failure to question the *official* government version. Authorities have only released info in a painstakingly slow drip-by-drip manner--and has treated Americans like SERFS who do not deserve to know the truth about their own history.

All 3 films dive fearlessly into territories that are difficult for many of us because they challenge our beliefs--which can be threatening. Certainly, to truly begin to understand the events it requires a great deal of thought and a vast storage of memory--but these documentaries take giant leaps into asking the right questions and should leave your brain cells rattling a bit as you realize some of the many theories which directly EXTINGUISH the OSWALD MYTH. (if you have not seen them all docs are FREE on youtube--just be advised to make sure you are watching the FULL version...example: the full version of MLK (part 6) in "E of R" is hard to find and also has rare, shocking photos of lynchings which are presented in a historical context to show the vicious racism which existed into the middle of the 20th century).

In 1949, the CIA installed a pro-American colonel, Adib Shishakli, as the Syrian leader. He won direct American military assistance along with covert financial aid. The CIA station chief in Damascus, Miles Copeland, called the colonel "a likeable rogue" who "had not, to my certain knowledge, ever bowed down to a graven image. He had, however, committed sacrilege, blasphemy, murder, adultery and theft." He lasted four years before he was overthrown by Ba'ath Party and communist politicians and military officers. 

In March 1955, Allen Dulles predicted that the country was "ripe for a military coup d'etat" supported by the agency. In April 1956, the CIA's Kim Roosevelt and his British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) counterpart Sir George Young tried to mobilize right-wing Syrian army officers; the CIA delivered half a million Syrian pounds to the leaders of the plot. But the Suez fiasco poisoned the political climate in the Middle East, pushed Syria closer to the Soviets, and forced the Americans and the British to postpone their plan at the end of October 1956.

In the spring and summer of April 1957,they revived it. A document discovered in 2003 among the private papers of Duncan Sandys, Prime Minister Harold Macmillan's defense secretary, spells out their effort in detail.

Syria had to be "made to appear as the sponsor of plots, sabotage and violence directed against neighbouring governments," it said. CIA and SIS would manufacture "national conspiracies and various strong-arm activities" in Iraq, Lebanon, and Jordan, and blame them on Syria. They would create paramilitary factions and spark revolts among the Muslim Brotherhood in Damascus. The creation of the appearance of instability would destabilize the government; border clashes manufactured by American and British intelligence would serve as a pretext for the pro- Western armies of Iraq and Jordan to invade. The CIA and SIS envisioned that any new regime they installed would likely "rely first upon repressive measures and arbitrary exercise of power" to survive.

Roosevelt identified Abdul Hamid Serraj, the longtime chief of the Syrian intelligence service, as the most powerful man in Damascus. Serraj was to be assassinated,along with the chief of the Syrian general staff and the head of the Communist Party.

The CIA sent Rocky Stone, who had cut his teeth in the Iran operation, to serve as the new chief of station in Damascus. Accredited as a diplomat, a second secretary at the American embassy, he used promises of millions of dollars and unlimited political power to befriend officers in the Syrian army. He represented his recruits in reports to headquarters as a crack corps for an American-backed coup.

Abdul Hamid Serraj saw through Stone in a matter of weeks.
The Syrians set up a sting. "The officers with whom Stone was deal- ing took his money and then went on television and announced that they had received this money from the 'corrupt and sinister Americans' in an attempt to overthrow the legitimate government of Syria," said Curtis F. Jones, a State Department officer sent to clean up the mess Stone left behind. Serraj's forces surrounded the American embassy in Damascus, seized Stone, and interrogated him roughly. He told them everything he knew. The Syrians identified him publicly as an American spy posing as a diplomat, a veteran of the CIA's coup in Iran, and a conspirator with Syrian army officers and politicians to overthrow the government in exchange for millions of dollars in American aid.

The revelation of this "particularly clumsy CIA plot," in the words of the U.S. ambassador to Syria, Charles Yost, had consequences that reverberate today. The Syrian government formally declared Rocky Stone persona non grata. That was the first time that an American diplomat of any stripebe he a spy working undercover or a bona fide State Department officerhad been expelled from an Arab nation. In turn, the United States expelled the Syrian ambassador to Washington, the first expulsion of any foreign diplomat from Washington since World War I. The United States denounced Syria's "fabrications" and "slanders." Stone's Syrian co-conspirators, including the former president, Adib Shishakli, were sentenced to death. A purge of every military officer who had ever been associated with the American embassy followed. 




 Could the 2 year+ delay of the official 9/11 Commission also have served to allow the CIA-NSA-DoD Cabal to neutralize any individuals stepping forward with information which the Cabal didnt want to become public? 

from Page 84 of *The Commission: The Uncensored History of the 9/11 Investigation* by Philip Shenon (2008):

The offices were in a seemingly undistinguished nine-floor federal building between the White House and Georgetown. The building was secretly owned and operated by the CIA, used as downtown office space by the agency. It was ideal for the commission because it qualified as a so-called SCIF, the acronym for secure compartmentalized information facility, which meant that it had security measures that allowed for the storage of highly classified documents. Apart from witnesses called to private interviews from the commission, only people with security clearances would be allowed to enter the commission's offices; all cell phones and other electronic devices had to be left at the door. Each of the staff members at K Street was provided with two computer hard drives--one for classified information, one for unclassified information.

 According to Daniel Ellsbergs *SECRETS: A Memoir of Vietnam and the Pentagon Papers* (2002):

However, in the fall of 1961 a highly secret, dramatically revised national intelligence estimate turned the strategic world that had preoccupied me for three years upside down. The missile gap favoring the Soviets had been a fantasy. There was a gap, all right, but it was currently ten to one in our favor. Our 40 Atlas and Titan ICBMs were matched by 4 Soviet SS-6 ICBMs at one launching site at Plesetsk, not by 120, as in the latest national estimate in June, or by the SAC commanders estimate of 1,000 I had heard of at SAC headquarters in August. The specter of a deliberate Soviet surprise attack suddenly appeared, with the new estimates, to have been a chimera. 

...the new estimate was kept effectively secret from Congress, the press, and the public, and it had a comparably imperceptible effect on military programs. It was after this secret recognition that the Soviets  had deployed four liquid-fueled ICBMs to our forty that the Kennedy administration decided, in the late fall of 1961, on the appropriate size for the projected force of U.S. solid-fueled Minuteman missiles: one thousand. That was less than the 1,600 to 6,000 that the air force had earlier requested, but it was down only to the level that Secretary McNamara had earlier decided on *before* the new estimate. (pages 32-33)

**THREAT INFLATION**

------------------------

The 6 paragraphs below are taken from Chapter 7 of a free online book *The Pentagon Labyrinth* (2011). Full article "Follow the Money" by Andrew Cockburn (2011): http://pogoarchives.org/labyrinth/07-cockburn-w-covers.pdf

------------------------------

Recall that following victory in World War II, the U.S. rapidly disarmed, disbanding its huge conscript army and slashing weapons production. The economies of our allies and enemies in the recent conflict lay in total ruin. Although the Soviet Union controlled eastern European states overrun by the Red Army during the war, this was by prior agreement with the U.S. and Britain. Suddenly, in the spring of 1948, senior officials of the Truman Administration suddenly began issuing ominous warnings that the Soviet Union was bent on war and might attack at any time. A warning to that effectwar could come at any timewas solicited by the chief of army intelligence from the U.S. commander in Germany, General Lucius Clay, and duly leaked to the press.

Why?

The answer is clear for anyone who remembers to follow the money. The aircraft corporations who had garnered enormous profits during the war on the back of government contracts had discovered by 1947 that **peace was ruinous**. Despite initial high hopes, the commercial marketplace was proving a far harsher and less accommodating environment than that of wartime, especially as there were far more companies than required by the peacetime economy. Orders from the civilian airline industry never lived up to expectations while efforts to diversify into other products, including dishwashers and stainless steel coffins, proved disappointing and costly.

Something had to be done. In the spring of 1948 senior officials in the Truman Administration, including Secretary of Defense James Forrestal, suddenly began warning that the Soviets were on the brink of unleashing a surprise military attack against Western Europe. There was **no evidence** that the Soviets had any such intentions, a point, as declassified documents now make clear, that was well known to the senior officials. In fact Stalin, the Soviet leader, was enjoining the powerful western European communist parties from any revolutionary action and refusing to aid the Greek communists in their civil war against the U.S.-backed government.

This cause (need for stimulus in the aerospace industry) and effect (war scare leading to sharp increase in defense appropriations) was pithily summed up at the time by Lawrence D. Bell, President of the Bell Aircraft Corporation: As soon as there is a war scare, there is a lot of money available. And so it proved. The aircraft procurement budget soared **57**% as the overall Pentagon procurement budget exploded by almost **600** percent from less than $6 billion in 1947 to more than $35 billion in 1948 (in contemporary 2011 dollars). The industry, not to mention powerful institutions linked to its fortunes, such as **major banks**, was saved from collapse.

Apart from a brief relapse pending the outbreak of the Korean war in 1950, war scares, otherwise known as **threat inflation** would thereafter be a regular feature of the U.S. political and economic landscape. It mattered little what the Soviet enemy was actually doing, or in a position to do. All that was required was for an announcement that intelligence had revealed an ominous gap between U.S. and Soviet capabilities, and the money flowed. The missile gap on which John F. Kennedy rode to victory in 1960 yielded an immediate fifteen percent hike in defense spending. Years after the money had been appropriated and spent, **it was openly admitted by the relevant defense secretary, Robert McNamara, that in fact the gap had been entirely in favor of the U.S.** Similar, if less infamous episodes recurred featuring bombers, tanks, ships, anti-ballistic missiles and, most comprehensively, defense budgets themselves.

Embarrassing realities, such as serious shortcomings in our putative enemies capabilities, have generally been kept out of sight of the taxpayers. Equally, explosive cost overruns and technical disasters generate, at most, short term scandals. Pleas to cut the defense budget have rarely yielded much of a political dividend. Indeed, in former days, the very size of the budget, irrespective of its components, was touted as a necessary part of our deterrent. One of the more successful gaps of the cold war years was the greater size of the Soviet defense budget. **The Soviets didnt announce how much they were spending on defense** (even if they knew the real cost themselves, which is dubious); so the figure publicized by the military industrial complex was based on an ersatz calculation of the presumed cost to the Soviets of duplicating U.S. programs and systems. I.E., the cost of a Soviet swing-wing bomber would be assessed on the basis of the cost of a similar U.S. effort. Therefore, as Ernie Fitzgerald, the consummate Pentagon whistleblower of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, once observed, every time the B-1 bomber has a cost overrun, the Soviet defense budget goes up! In other words, the more dollars we wasted, the more dangerous the other side became, which justified our wasting even more dollars, and so on.

Seems to be pure Fearmongering 101...INFLATE the threat and fund some more Defense/Intelligence NOW!!!

The 2014 National Security Budgets of the U.S. and Russia are estimated at:

**FACT:**  U.S. has gone over $1 TRILLION for 2014 (if the last $65 Billion goes through that Obama requested for Defense in early July goes through).

**FACT:**  Russias 2014 National Security Budget is not even at $75 Billion

SO, the U.S. spends OVER 10X what Russia is spending on National Security in 2014. In fact, the additional $65 Billion Obama recently requested is almost the *entire* amount that Russia will spend for National Security in all of 2014.

Mike Hayden and Vito Potenza drove down from Fort Meade after lunch on February 19, 2004, to give Jim Comey his first briefing on the program. In the Justice Departments sixth-floor SCIF, Hayden got Comeys attention fast. 

Im so glad youre getting read in, because now I wont be alone at the table when John Kerry is elected president, he said. The witness table, Hayden meant. Congressional hearing, investigation of some kind. Nothing good. Kerry had the Democratic nomination just about locked up and was leading Bush in national polls. Hardly anyone believed the next administration would climb as far out on a legal limb as this one had. That was one reason Hayden pushed for some kind of congressional notification.

Seems to be a PATTERN here--as if they clearly KNEW they were breaking the law. 












































 In a May 2011 speech, then-Secretary of Defense Robert Gates described the Pentagons business operations as an amalgam of fiefdoms without centralized mechanisms to allocate resources, track expenditures, and measure results.  My staff and I learned that it was nearly impossible to get accurate information and answers to questions such as How much money did you spend and How many people do you have? 

http://www.reuters.com/investigates/pentagon/#article/part2

A search in the Budget Overview document for the word "audit," for example, will take you to page 7-34, among others, where you will find that DOD set a goal of reaching 100 percent readiness to audit its assets and liabilities by the year 2017, but the last column shows that the indicator of progress made toward that goal in FY 2010 was deleted at the request of the Comptroller, who happens to be the chief financial officer of DOD! Furthermore, the auditability asserted for 2017 would not include any audits of specific weapons programs!

 I find no logic in comparing the wars the U.S. began after 9/11 with WWII (which was put in motion by Hitlers invasion of Poland). I find it equally offensive to simply accept the justification that there are fewer casualties in todays wars."

After 9/11 the U.S. literally raced off to war without even conducting proper, thorough investigations of what ACTUALLY took place. Evil Dick Cheney even asked Senator Tom Daschle, who was on the Intelligence Committee, [NOT to investigate 9/11 on several occassions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePOIhhd9Jr0).

Afghanistan offered to turn UBL over to U.S. authorities if the U.S. provided proof he had ordered the strikes--but the U.S. didnt even respond. Instead, the CIA began operations in Afghanistan by going  around Tora Bora throwing millions of dollars in cash to local tribes...Of course, the CIA came up empty handed.

We all know the intelligence was cooked on Iraq to give Bush/Cheney their useless, illegal war.

 I was impressed with Shenons *The Commission*--but definitely do understand David Ray Griffins frustration with Shenon. I think part of what Shenon has attempted to capture in *The Commission* and *A Cruel and Shocking Act* was the inner workings of the way the 9/11 Commission and the Warren Commission functioned; meaning that Shenon was not trying to reveal the truth of what happened on 11-22-63 or 9/11. Shenon was more interested in the structure of the commissions, how the information flowed and the personalities which ended up controlling the output. 

Personally, I find this approach to be obtuse--how could Shenon not find a way to follow up with some investigation at the NSA?

The fact that it takes 5 years and $40 million to edit" the Torture Report should also tell you a lot about how CROOKED the US government is--and how incredibly NAIVE Americans are. In comparison, the 9/11 Commission was initially funded with $3 million and given just 16 months to complete their fictitious report.

 A Little History...

--------------

In 1949, the CIA installed a pro-American colonel, Adib Shishakli, as the Syrian leader. He won direct American military assistance along with covert financial aid. The CIA station chief in Damascus, Miles Copeland, called the colonel "a likeable rogue" who "had not, to my certain knowledge, ever bowed down to a graven image. He had, however, committed sacrilege, blasphemy, murder, adultery and theft." He lasted four years before he was overthrown by Ba'ath Party and communist politicians and military officers. 

In March 1955, Allen Dulles predicted that the country was "ripe for a military coup d'etat" supported by the agency. In April 1956, the CIA's Kim Roosevelt and his British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) counterpart Sir George Young tried to mobilize right-wing Syrian army officers; the CIA delivered half a million Syrian pounds to the leaders of the plot. But the Suez fiasco poisoned the political climate in the Middle East, pushed Syria closer to the Soviets, and forced the Americans and the British to postpone their plan at the end of October 1956.

In the spring and summer of April 1957,they revived it. A document discovered in 2003 among the private papers of Duncan Sandys, Prime Minister Harold Macmillan's defense secretary, spells out their effort in detail.

Syria had to be "made to appear as the sponsor of plots, sabotage and violence directed against neighbouring governments," it said. CIA and SIS would manufacture "national conspiracies and various strong-arm activities" in Iraq, Lebanon, and Jordan, and blame them on Syria. They would create paramilitary factions and spark revolts among the Muslim Brotherhood in Damascus. The creation of the appearance of instability would destabilize the government; border clashes manufactured by American and British intelligence would serve as a pretext for the pro- Western armies of Iraq and Jordan to invade. The CIA and SIS envisioned that any new regime they installed would likely "rely first upon repressive measures and arbitrary exercise of power" to survive.

Roosevelt identified Abdul Hamid Serraj, the longtime chief of the Syrian intelligence service, as the most powerful man in Damascus. Serraj was to be assassinated,along with the chief of the Syrian general staff and the head of the Communist Party.

The CIA sent Rocky Stone, who had cut his teeth in the Iran operation, to serve as the new chief of station in Damascus. Accredited as a diplomat, a second secretary at the American embassy, he used promises of millions of dollars and unlimited political power to befriend officers in the Syrian army. He represented his recruits in reports to headquarters as a crack corps for an American-backed coup.

Abdul Hamid Serraj saw through Stone in a matter of weeks.
The Syrians set up a sting. "The officers with whom Stone was deal- ing took his money and then went on television and announced that they had received this money from the 'corrupt and sinister Americans' in an attempt to overthrow the legitimate government of Syria," said Curtis F. Jones, a State Department officer sent to clean up the mess Stone left behind. Serraj's forces surrounded the American embassy in Damascus, seized Stone, and interrogated him roughly. He told them everything he knew. The Syrians identified him publicly as an American spy posing as a diplomat, a veteran of the CIA's coup in Iran, and a conspirator with Syrian army officers and politicians to overthrow the government in exchange for millions of dollars in American aid.

The revelation of this "particularly clumsy CIA plot," in the words of the U.S. ambassador to Syria, Charles Yost, had consequences that reverberate today. The Syrian government formally declared Rocky Stone persona non grata. That was the first time that an American diplomat of any stripebe he a spy working undercover or a bona fide State Department officerhad been expelled from an Arab nation. In turn, the United States expelled the Syrian ambassador to Washington, the first expulsion of any foreign diplomat from Washington since World War I. The United States denounced Syria's "fabrications" and "slanders." Stone's Syrian co-conspirators, including the former president, Adib Shishakli, were sentenced to death. A purge of every military officer who had ever been associated with the American embassy followed.

 This is part of the problem--DISSENTING VOICES are being categorically stricken from the main stream media, and now from the larger subreddits as well. 

The media has become fully complicit in the Pep Rallies to go to war in Syria. Far too often we are fed headlines with unsubstantiated facts. Then a few days later the facts dissolve into dust, but the headline has served its purpose: to strike fear and hate into the U.S. taxpayers so the CIA and the NSA and the Pentagon can proceed with their bombings and their spying and their killing.
 




 Maybe the U.S. told Germany they will never get their gold back if they investigate. 




 and Why is RT--a Russian funded station--the Only channel still asking questions??? 




 Which is why I found Amy Zegarts findings to be shocking--the intelligence oversight committees between 1985-2005 ranked LAST in hearings held every year except for one. 

In the "Age of Terrorism" you would think we would demand a more public display of evidence. Instead, we know more about Casey Anthony than we do about the 9/11 terrorists. There have only been 2 criminal trials related to 9/11 in the U.S.--Zacarias Moussouai and UBLs driver (forget his name).  




 Surprising how quiet Americans are about the systemic consitutional violations conducted by the NSA since 9/11. Theres only been 1 writer (Lucy Steigerwald) that I know of who was bold enough to even suggest we think about some prosecutions (and that was for the Torture)...

I guess the CIA is considering changing up the infrastructure as well--the Wash Post had an article which Ray McGovern cited in his latest editorial over at Consortium News.  




 Most Americans dont even realize how many countries the U.S. is actively conducting operations in...

-----------------

It is time for members of Congress who truly care about rule of law, oversight and the financial security of this country to speak up. Why? Because, first and foremost, the AUMF continues to contravene congressional oversight. For example, when the Obama administration sent 100 "military advisors" to Uganda in the name of counterterrorism in 2011, Congress received a simple note from President Obama. No oversight.

More recently, after unilaterally negotiating a "status of forces" agreement with Niger, the administration sent a note to Congress saying that it was sending 100 troops to the country. This week, we sent troops to Mali. Again, no oversight.

This is the new normal. Statistics provided by Special Operations Command (pdf) indicate that special forces groups were operating in 92 different countries in March 2013. The AUMF premise, no matter how it gets tweaked, is enabling a system of eternal warfare, a reality that is not only financially untenable for a nation in deep debt, but also ethically indefensible.

http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/05/authorization-use-military-force-blank-check 




 the other problem is the massive privatization of the military-intelligence sectors--how do we have any idea what they are doing? Dana Priest and William Arkin wrote the book Top Secret America (which was also a WaPo special investigation, then a Frontline documentary)...

* Some 1,271 government organizations and 1,931 private companies work on programs related to counterterrorism, homeland security and intelligence in about 10,000 locations across the United States.

* An estimated 854,000 people, nearly 1.5 times as many people as live in Washington, D.C., hold top-secret security clearances.

* In Washington and the surrounding area, 33 building complexes for top-secret intelligence work are under construction or have been built since September 2001. Together they occupy the equivalent of almost three Pentagons or 22 U.S. Capitol buildings - about 17 million square feet of space.

 Yes, History Commons has some surprising strains. Regarding the 70s oversight committees, last year Foreign Policy published an article that was based entirely on just one page of an internal NSA history which proved the NSA was spying on Sen. Frank Church (among many other Americans). I think it was Page 83 of a 2 Volume history--what do the other pages contain (and how many total pages are there)?

GLENN HASTEDT, AUG 23 2013

A starting point to deciphering how effectively Congress has handled its intelligence oversight responsibility here is to look to existing studies of congressional oversight.  They depict a weak oversight system marked by two characteristics.  First, it is overwhelmingly reactive, rather than anticipatory: it acts as a fireman responding to a problem rather than as police officers on patrol looking for problems.  Congressional oversight is thus sporadic.  It occurs when a fire breaks out and ceases when the fire is extinguished, to return again should smoldering embers produce another fire.

This pattern is very much in evidence in intelligence community oversight.  Four major intelligence fires have been put out.   In the mid-1970s the fire was widespread illegal Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) activity within the United States including wiretapping and mail openings.  In the mid-1980s controversy centered on the Reagan administrations covert action program in Latin America.  The 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States brought forward the third congressional wave of intelligence community oversight.

Most recently we have witnessed a rapid series of fire alarms set off by disputes over the conduct of the Global War on Terrorism.  Collectively they can be seen as constituting a fourth major fire.  The first involved a secret warrantless surveillance program authorized by President George W. Bush in October 2001 giving the NSA  the authority to intercept communications between individuals on American soil and individuals abroad without judicial approval, in essence circumventing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance (FISA) Court.  The second centered on the nature of the techniques used to interrogate suspected terrorists at the Guantanamo Naval Base.  The third involved the increased use of drone aircraft to kill suspected terrorists, especially Americans.  The NSA revelations are the most current fire alarm to be set off.

Amy B. Zegart 	The Roots of Weak Congressional Intelligence Oversight 

Another senior intelligence official noted that oversight had deteriorated so much during his career that I dont even know what good oversight looks like anymore.[12] Overseers agreed. One legislator who served on a congressional intelligence committee called oversight horrible and said that improving even the intelligence budget process would mean that somebody in Congress would have to die.

These qualitative impressions are supported by two quantitative metrics most frequently used to evaluate oversight: hearing and legislative productivity. Tracking hearings held by fifteen House and Senate committees in 1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, and 2005, I found that the intelligence committees ranked at the bottom every year except one. In 2005, the House Intelligence Committee held just 23 hearings (both classified and unclassified), compared to 77 hearings in the Energy and Commerce Committee,
91 in the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, and 104 hearings held by the Foreign Affairs Committee. Intelligence committees also trailed behind others in producing legislation. In a comparison of legislative productivity among four major Senate policy committees, intelligence again ranked last. Between 1985 and 2005, the Senate Intelligence Committee considered an average of just six bills per year. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee considered an average of 118 bills per year, the Senate Banking Committee considered 161 bills, and the Senate Commerce Committee considered an average of 241 bills each year.

First, a brief history. After revelations about abuses by the CIA and other agencies in the 1970s, Congress struck what Stephen Vladeck, a professor of law at American University, calls a grand bargain, to accommodate the paradoxical need to submit secret programs to democratic oversight. New legal constraints on intelligence activities would be enforced not in public but instead behind the veil by the intelligence committees and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (also known as the FISA court). As Colorado Senator Mark Udall said at the Intelligence Committee hearing, This committee was created to address a severe breach of trust that developed when it was revealed that the CIA was conducting unlawful domestic searches.

The Snowden leaks indicate the bargain has broken down. In essence, the delicate balance Congress sought to strike thirty-five years ago now appears to be tipped, rather decisively, in favor of the intelligence community, Vladeck explained in an e-mail.

Intelligence officials have done some of that tipping themselves, by withholding information from the public and lawmakers. On Wednesday, Wyden said the committee had been stonewalled by intelligence officials; indeed, none of his questions received direct answers, although Wyden did receive promises from officials to get back to him by specific deadlines. Wyden also cited several incidents in which officials had given inaccurate testimony in public hearings. Last March, for example, James Clapper told Wyden that the NSA did not wittingly collect data on American citizens, a claim we now know from the Snowden leaks to be false.

Denis McDonough Supported Intelligence Oversight When Bush Was President
Posted: 10/28/2014 by Ali Watkins and Ryan Grim

In 2006, with the Bush administration resisting efforts by Congress to look into the execution of its global war on terror, the Center for American Progress published a thorough document outlining the role of transparency in democracy.

Previous Senate and House Members of the intelligence committees were notably different from their successors today," the report lamented. "They were more interested in performing their oversight function responsibly than in protecting the executive branch when a committee member was of the same party."

The paper's lead author: Denis McDonough.

Today, it's McDonough, the White House chief of staff, who is protecting the executive branch from Senate Democrats fighting to perform their oversight function.

But in 2006, Center for American Progress fellow McDonough was deeply unsatisfied with the state of intelligence oversight in the U.S. Congress. Its completely lacking and soft, he wrote in his report on the subject, and the committees are far too deferential to the executive branch.

 The CIA, the Pentagon and Wall Street run the show.

If you dont believe me--then why does it take 6 years and $40 million to EDIT a Torture Report???

FYI: If anyone at the Justice Department actually gave a fuck about the U.S. Constitution + the Bill of Rights--then the Upper Brass at the NSA from the past 13 years would have been read their rights before an actual investigation began. (And, YES, the NSAs corporate criminal partners such as Booz Allen should be included as well.)

I have no doubt that if the Justice Department ever got around to defending the laws of the U.S. that the Pentagon would just start another useless Trillion Dollar War--which looks to be coming up soon anyways.

 ----------------------

There is also a history of Saudi money being used by the CIA (which GHW Bush was director of in 1976)...

From [Consortium News](http://www.consortiumnews.com/2000/121900b.html):

Weinberger was one of the first officials outside the White House to learn that Reagan had put the arm on **Saudi Arabia** to give the contras $1 million a month in 1984, as Congress was cutting off the CIA's covert assistance through what was known as the Boland Amendment.

Handling the contra-funding arrangements was Saudi ambassador **Prince Bandar**...
In 1985, the Saudis doubled their annual contra gift from $12 million to $25 million...


-------------------- 




 Some great tidbits in the History Commons Timeline that allow you to connect the dots--Cheney saved the Reagan-Bush presidency by defusing the Iran-Contra investigation...Cheney was then rewarded with the Sec. of Defense post under GHW Bush...I also didnt realize that David Addington was asst general counsel for the CIA during Iran-Contra (addington would become Cheneys attorney in the OVP under GW in 2001).

from http://www.consortiumnews.com/2000/110500b.html

-----------------

But the Reagan-Bush administration was not ready to tell all. Immediately, the administration and Republicans on Capitol Hill moved to counter and to contain the scandal. For his part, Bush insisted that he was not in the loop on the Iran-contra business.

Cheney to the Rescue

One of the key congressional Republicans fighting this rear-guard action was Rep. Dick Cheney of Wyoming, who became the ranking House Republican on the Iran-contra investigation. Cheney already enjoyed a favorable reputation in Washington as a steady conservative hand.

Cheney smartly exploited his relationship with Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., who was chairman of the Iran-contra panel. Hamilton cared deeply about his reputation for bipartisanship and the Republicans quickly exploited this fact.

A senior committee source said one of Cheneys top priorities was to block Democrats from deposing Vice President Bush about his Iran-contra knowledge. Cheney kept trying to intimidate Hamilton, the source said. He kept saying if we go down that road, we wont have bipartisanship.

So, Hamilton gave Bush a pass. The limited investigation also gave little attention to other sensitive areas, such as contra-drug trafficking and the public diplomacy operation. They were pared down or tossed out altogether.

Despite surrendering to Cheneys demands time and again, Hamilton failed, in the end, to get a single House Republican to sign the final report.

Only three moderate Republicans on the Senate side  Warren Rudman, William Cohen and Paul Trible  agreed to sign the report, after extracting more concessions. Cheney and the other Republicans submitted a minority report that denied that any significant wrongdoing had occurred.

The watered-down Iran-contra majority report essentially let Vice President Bush off the hook. Bushs political career was saved.

With the Iran-contra scandal contained, Bush mounted a 1988 presidential campaign that set the modern standard for negativity, race-baiting and a win-at-all-cost ethic. In 1989, Cheney became Bushs defense secretary.

 Perhaps the Saudis were helping the CIA create an enemy. After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the US defense industry needed to replace Enemy #1, the Communists...

"Were the Soviet Union to sink tomorrow under the waters of the ocean, the American militaryindustrial complex would have to remain, substantially unchanged, **until some other adversary could be invented**. Anything else would be an unacceptable shock to the American economy."

 The U.S. has spent about [$10 TRILLION in total National Security Budget since 9/11](http://www.pogo.org/our-work/straus-military-reform-project/defense-budget/2014/americas-one-trillion-national-security-budget.html) including about $5 TRILLION on the useless wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. 

The lies of the Bush-Cheney War Criminals have all been shredded--there were no WMDs in Iraq, there were no Iraqi-Al Qaeda connections. The Bush-Cheney administration claimed Usama bin Laden (et al.) planned and carried out the attacks of 9/11--yet the administration balked when Afghanistan offered to capture and turn over UBL if the U.S. could show proof that UBL committed the 9/11 attacks. 

Instead, Bush-Cheney never provided any evidence--they sent in the CIA into Afghanistan with plenty of CASH on hand to pay off Afghan warlords to help hunt UBL in Tora Bora. Apparently throwing millions of dollars around in foreign countries doesnt always guarantee success--so the U.S. military went to war in Afghanistan. 

Back in the U.S., the Bush-Cheney War Criminals began covering up 9/11 by asking the Joint Congressional Inquiry into 9/11 NOT to investigate--in fact [Dick Cheney asked Tom Daschle NOT to investigate several times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePOIhhd9Jr0). The CIA, the FBI, the NSA all stonewalled the 9/11 Commission at every turn as well. In the end, the 9/11 Commission co-chairmen wrote a letter in the *NYT* accusing the [White House and the CIA of OBSTRUCTING the 9/11 investigation](http://www.salon.com/2008/01/02/obstruction/).

General Wesley Clark is also on the record stating the [Bush-Cheney War Criminals intended to go to War with 7 countries in 5 years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RC1Mepk_Sw). 

I dont know what exactly happened on 9/11--but I do know the U.S. government is LYING and the 9/11 Commission Report was a WHITEWASH. If you havent looked into any of these issues I would urge you do some research--because the USA seems to have become fixated on war. 

The list of countries the US has bombed and/or attempted to overthrow the government of since the end of WWII is most likely much longer than you think. Lately, I definitely worry that eventually the world is going to get sick of the US bullying its way around the globe with boots on the ground in over 100 countries.

I posted [Notes from an interview with White House Deputy Chief of Staff Josh Bolten](http://www.scribd.com/doc/231427854/DH-B2-Josh-Bolten)--on page 4 it states that Dick Cheney gave the order to shoot down Flight 93, then verified it was shot down and called POTUS to let him know it was shot down.

In the comments for the Josh Bolten post, someone questioned where exactly all of these documents were coming from...the best answer was from u/pubestash:

I'm surprised this hasn't gotten more attention. Maybe its just assumed to be true here already but this is some strong evidence from official documents stating that 93 was shot down by Cheney.

These do look legit btw, here on [archives.gov](http://www.archives.gov/research/9-11/faqs.html) is the FAQ for the 9/11 commission documents and they say how NARA will be making these available online. The scribd profile is of those people scanning the documents.

 throughout the 1990s the UN conducted weapons inspections in Iraq which included satellite photos and input from intelligence agencies (CIA, Mi6, etc)...The US knew Saddam had nothing, yet the Bush-Cheney administration was salivating to go to war in Iraq.

 TIME to OPEN UP some more FBI-CIA-NSA files...Unredacted, of course. 




 Documents which define history should belong to the public, not private interests."

I would argue that all FBI-CIA-NSA files should be released unredacted no later than 8 years after creation. This would act as a deterrent to government officials abusing their power--and allow We, the People to know our true history. As taxpayers, we have also paid them to act in our interest and deserve to know the TRUTH. 




 I was surprised this wasnt the #1 news story of the day--glad it made it to #1 in r/politics...

Interesting that Beverly Gage (who found the uncensored letter) wrote a book in 2009 on the 1920 bombing of Wall Street. Even though almost 90 years had passed, Gage couldnt get the US government to release any new files. You would think a Yale history professor would have some connections...

Well, Im glad she scored big on this one...but Id love to see pressure for the release of more FBI-CIA-NSA files!!! 




 I also think its time to open up more FBI-CIA-NSA files!!!!!

Pretty depressing how often Obama has quoted MLK/JFK/RFK, yet he has failed to demand the release of their files...its almost like Obama forgot they all got WHACKED.

An interesting side note is that Beverly Gage wrote a book on the 1920 bombing of Wall Street--she couldnt get the US government to release any files...over 85 years later!!!

Its also time to take J. Edgar Hoovers name off all federal buildings.

Army Intelligence first began spying on MLKs family back in 1917...the FBI opened their file on MLK in 1947.


 









 Maybe someday the soldiers will come to understand that they were sent to war in Iraq, Not for WMDs, Not for Iraqi connections to Al Qaeda, Not because Saddam Hussein had tried to whack GHW Bush--but because in November, 2000 Saddam Hussein had detached Iraq from the PETRO-DOLLAR.

**Saddam Turns His Back on Greenbacks
By William Dowell for TIME. Monday, Nov. 13, 2000**.

Europes dream of promoting the euro as a competitor to the U.S. dollar may get a boost from SADDAM HUSSEIN. Iraq says that from now on, it wants payments for its oil in euros, despite the fact that the battered European currency unit, which used to be worth quite a bit more than $1, has dropped to about 82[cents]. Iraq says it will no longer accept dollars for oil because it does not want to deal in the currency of the enemy.

The switch to euros would cost the U.N. a small fortune in accounting-paperwork changes. It would also reduce the interest earnings and reparations payments that Iraq is making for damage it caused during the Gulf War, a shortfall the Iraqis would have to make up.

The move hurts Iraq, the U.N. and the countries receiving reparations. So why is Saddam doing it? Diplomatic sources say switching to the euro will favor European suppliers over U.S. ones in competing for Iraqi contracts, and the p.r. boost that Baghdad would probably get in Europe would be another plus.

 They also have buildings which go [up 4 levels...and DOWN 12 floors](http://video.pbs.org/video/2365004424/).

The 9/11 Commission offices were also located in a CIA owned/managed building (source: Philip Shenon, *The Commission*)...wonder if they were SPIED ON by the CIA-NSA as well... 




 Has anything been done about the NSA spying on U.S. citizens? Have the upper brass at the NSA been read their rights? In the 70s, according to [James Bamford](https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/10/02/the-nsa-and-me/), the attorney general actually took this step. Interestingly enough, Bamford was also working with a secret 6,000 page document.

But my biggest battle with the NSA came before my book was even published. Without the agencys knowledge, I had obtained the criminal file that the Justice Department had opened on the NSA. Marked as Top Secret, the file was so sensitive that only two original copies existed. Never before or since has an entire agency been the subject of a criminal investigation. **Senior officials at the NSA were even read their Miranda rights**.

Obamas first words were basically Look forward, not back. So, NO...nothing will be done.
 




 [HERES](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1109052-senate-intelligence-report-list-of-cia-findings.html) the list that McClatchys news got in trouble for leaking...seems written with the intention of putting everyone to sleep. also troubling is the CIAs constant Propaganda Wurlitzer chiming in before the Torture Report even comes out.

The Pentagon swallowing Trillions of dollars since 9/11...shipping cargo jets filled with billions of dollars to Iraq--no receipt needed (just sign here...wink, wink). No wonder [the Pentagon wont submit to an audit](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/pentagon/#article/part2).

They cant [release their 9/11 files](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/classified-pages-911-report-may-implicate-key-u-s-ally/), but they sure can spend those Billions upon Billions of dollars that rained down after [the towers exploded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUDoGuLpirc) on TV.

They cant tell if a country has WMDs or not, but they sure can jump into a useless war (and then extend it for a decade).

They couldnt find Usama bin Laden--even though they were paying the Afghan warlords millions and the Pakistanis billions.

They cant believe Americans would buy into this whole cascade of lies and willingly keep paying for more.

the investors make money... 




 Furthermore, the 9/11 Commission Report contained at least 2 chapters which relied heavily on testimony of detainees gained using torture--which makes the evidence inadmissible. 

Once you consider the fact that the 9/11 Commission was initially funded with $3 million and 18 months to produce their report; and that the SSCI funded the Torture Report Summary with $40 million and allowed the CIA-approved attorneys 4 years to slice, dice and blackout the findings--now you might be able to understand what a WHITEWASH the 9/11 Commission was.

 NOW HIRING: U.S. Boots on the ground Christmas 2014 tour in Iraq...Syria Summer 2015

Call U.S. WAR, INC for an interview

 




 James Angleton, written off as a crank and a madman by his critics, had the hardest job in the CIA: keeping the enemy out. What he learned before his death was that we are our own worst enemy. 

When I ventured to his pleasant house in Arlington in late 1985, I found him coming to grips with this thought. I realize how I have wasted my existence, my professional life, he told me. He was not bitter--just uncomfortable with the thought. His entire being told him that his beloved intelligence community had been penetrated by the Soviets with agents of great skill. He understood why his colleagues in the CIA eventually grew tired of his mole hunts and his efforts to protect the place. I was always the skunk at the garden party, and even your friends tire of that, he said.

The last time I saw James Angleton, his face, always thinner than thin, had changed little, even though the cigarettes he would not give up had destroyed his lungs with cancer. The other cancer that was eating away at him was the suspicion and fear that came with his job. He was a man estranged by his career from his wife and children and dying in total emotional isolation.

Within the confines of his remarkable life were most of Americas secrets. You know how I got to be in charge of counterintelligence? I agreed not to polygraph or require detailed background checks on Allen Dulles and 60 of his closest friends. His monologue would stop only for a sip of tea or a violent fit of coughing. They were afraid that their own business dealings with Hitlers pals would come out. They were too arrogant to believe that the Russians would discover it at all. The real problem, Angleton concluded, was that there was no accountability. And without real accountability everything turned to shit.

All the trappings of Angletons legend were gone by this time, except for his love of exotic tea. But now, this man who had struck fear into most of his colleagues--the man who had been able to end a CIA career with a nod or a phone call--unassuming house seemed empty. You know, the CIA got tens of thousands of brave people killed...We played with lives as if we owned them. We gave false hope. We--I--so misjudged what happened.

I asked the old man dying how it all went so wrong. With no emotion in his voice, but with his hand trembling, Angleton replied: Fundamentally, the founding fathers of U.S. intelligence were liars. The better you lied and the more you betrayed, the more likely you would be promoted. These people attracted and promoted each other. Outside of their duplicity, the only thing they had in common was a desire for absolute power. I did things that, in looking back on my life, I regret. But I was part of it and loved being in it...Allen Dulles, Richard Helms, Carmel Offie and Frank Wisner were the grand masters. If you were in a room with them you were in a room full of people that you had to believe would deservedly end up in hell. Angleton slowly sipped his tea and then said, I guess I will see them there soon.

Angleton has been portrayed as a lunatic and even a torturer, and, as this book has documented, he did harm to many colleagues. However, I hope this book also clarifies who he really was and gives the reader a sense of the man whose lifes mission was to protect the CIA from the enemy. As he told me, Sometimes you can find the real enemy right in the mirror.

At the end, he seemed grateful for the release his lung cancer brought him. I am afraid whatever sins I have committed in my life, he said as he sipped his tea, have now come home to roost...I am fundamentally a failure. I failed to protect the CIA, because there was no real desire to secure the place from the Soviets. I never understood the great advantage the Russians had over us...As Americans we just hold no real value in secrecy. God, it was such a simple explanation.

 One count of aggravated assault? There were 2 people in the car that he showed menacing threatening behavior towards...How long did the off duty cop hold them illegally for? plus the off duty cop also cut the vehicle off...

If this was an average citizen who did this he would be charged with several different illegal acts--I hope the prosecutor increases the charges accordingly. 









 So WTF did McGovern do? He didnt even fucking enter the event--yet these thugs arrest him and pile on charges.

SHAME on these cops--they would be more in place under Stalin.

So now Americans cant enter an event to ask a simple question without getting roughed up and charged with multiple crimes? 

Keep fucking sleeping America... 




 shhhh...behind the Grassy Knoll was the [**Dallas County Sheriffs' PARKING LOT**](http://jfkmurdersolved.com/dpmap63.htm)...(a key was needed for entry/exit)

------------------------

Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Roger Craig wrote:

"**Let us examine this parking lot. It was leased by Deputy Sheriff B. D. Gossett. He in turn rented parking space by the month to the deputies who worked in the court house, except for official vehicles. I rented one of these spaces from Gossett when I was a dispatcher working days or evenings. I paid Gossett $3.00 per month and was given a key to the lot. An interesting point is that the lot had an iron bar across the only entrance and exit (which were the same). The bar had a chain and lock on it. The only people having access to it were deputies with keys**."

 So, its not because the CIA is filled with psychopathic criminals who are willing to lie or kill to cover up their rampant 67 year crime spree??? 




 FYI: Even people who were on the 9/11 Commission have stated they were LIED to and [OBSTRUCTED by the White House](http://www.salon.com/2008/01/02/obstruction/) and the CIA. 

At least 2 chapters of the 9/11 cOmmission Report were based in large part on testimony gained via TORTURE--which makes the evidence" inadmissible.

Senator Bob Graham also wrote a book about how the investigation by the Senate-House Joint Intelligence Committee was never allowed to investigate fully due to Bush/Cheney/CIA/FBI foot dragging.

Anyone who has looked into the facts KNOWS that the CIA and the DIA both knew some of the hijackers were in the U.S. in January 2000--but both the DIA and the CIA failed to notify the FBI that there were al qaeda in the U.S. The DIA operation which identified the hijackers was called ABLE DANGER--both cbs and cnn ran stories on the program in August of 2005: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME0iKZdoYXs 









 So, McGovern is on a BOLO list for an arrest in which the charges were dropped...

FUCKING ridiculous.

Heres a question for Patreus: "Hey, Patreus--did the NSA OUT YOU from your CIA job...or was it your Pentagon comrades???"

 Just look at William Blums Table of Contents page from his book [*KILLING HOPE: U.S. Military and CIA Interventions since WWII*](http://williamblum.org/books/killing-hope#toc)

 Bush couldnt even talk to the 9/11 Commission without Shrimp Dick Cheney going along to hold his hand. Neither were placed under oath, there were no notes allowed to be taken and it was considered an informal talk. 

But, yeah--Im sure they told the truth.

 "Those who can make you believe absurdities, can make you commit atrocities.

--Voltaire 




 The host was really trying his best to throw words into Russells mouth and stop him from finishing his points. when the host brought up 9/11 (out of the blue) I think he was just trying to bait him into making a statement which couldnt be logically discussed in the 3 minutes left on the show...so, Russell did a good job to sidestep the question by saying he is open minded on the subject. Im assuming Russell mentioned 9/11 in his book and the host wanted to drop that question in to make him look like a fool.

Russell did get one great line in: The time when people trust politicians--thats over, thats in the past." 




 I think the members of congress who questioned 9/11 were all railroaded out of office. 




 Peter Dale Scott addresses this issue in his articles, lectures and books:

----------------

In American history there are two types of events. There are ordinary events which the information systems of the country can understand and transmit. There are also deep events, or meta-events, which the mainstream information systems of the country cannot digest. I mean by a deep event one in which it is clear from the outset that there are aspects which will not be dealt with in the mainstream media, and will be studied only by those so-called conspiracy theorists who specialize in deep history.

 Russell handled him pretty well--he definitely stiff-armed a couple of questions and re-phrased them so he couldnt get painted in a corner...

If you havent seen it, the last time Russell was on bbc was worth a watch, too... 




 Atheists were much more likely to believe both republicans and democrats allow the CIA and the Pentagon to commit conspiracy after conspiracy--and then cover them up using crooked investigations and fake commissions. 




 Thanks for your work at ae911truth...just had a couple questions:

1. We know the WTC steel was quickly shipped off--much of it to be recycled in China and India--but, what were the most important pieces to analyze for a proper investigation? and what percentage of these pieces were investigators given access to? was WTC 7 handled the same as the Twin Towers? 

2. Wondering if you think the victims (and their families) have been silenced with a non-disclosure agreement which Feinbergs 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund may have contained...

**edit**: unfortunately, I wont be able to stick around for the AMA--hope someone can copy/paste these questions in the AMA...definitely will check it out later this afternoon...thanks to the mods and ae911truth--hope to see more AMAs in r/conspiracy!!! 




 theres still a lot of people coming round and realizing they have been lied to by the US government--NSA whistleblower William Binney just signed the ae911truth petition this year...(he did an interview on the Corbett Report with Richard Gage) 




 Even without the Torture Report, the evidence gained regarding 9/11 has already been tainted: 

--------------

And that the CIAs torture program ended up deceiving the 9/11 Commission. Specifically, the 9/11 Commission Report was largely based on third-hand accounts of what tortured detainees said, with two of the three parties in the communication being government employees. The 9/11 Commissioners were not allowed to speak with the detainees, or even their interrogators. Instead, they got their information third-hand. The Commission itself didnt really trust the interrogation testimony  yet published it as if it were Gospel.

New York Times investigative reporter Philip Shenon Newsweek noted in a 2009 essay in Newsweek: The 9/11 Commission appears to have ignored obvious clues throughout 2003 and 2004 that its account of the 9/11 plot and Al Qaeda's history relied heavily on information obtained from detainees who had been subjected to torture

 Theyll spend 6 years investigating--then pay $50 million to have CIA-approved attorneys shred the report down to under 500 pages...then release the watered-down version which omits the names and places... 




 I used to think Brand was an a-hole...now, I think he is respectable for the fact that he will speak his mind and doesnt just let the media run him over...Its just fucked that no one can mention 9/11 without a tear in their eye and a fucking flag wrapped around them. To question what exactly happened shouldnt be seen in a negative light. To be clear: the 9/11 question he largely just sidestepped--but it seems likely he wrote something in his book which definitely questions the Official Story.

9/11 was the Crime of the fucking Century--how many CSI and reality crime shows do people watch mindlessly every night? But to question real life crimes which actually matter is frowned upon because the media has brainwashed the citizens.

 I doubt if the frontline doc included Thomas Drake's (et al.) letter--it was released January 2014 or so...

So, in addition to NSA Insiders' claiming the NSA obstructed the 9/11 Commission--we also have the Co-Chairs of the 9/11 Commision who claimed their investigation was obstructed by the White House and the CIA...Glenn Greenwald wrote an article in 2008: http://www.salon.com/2008/01/02/obstruction/

In fact, when former 9/11 Commission member Max Cleland was asked if there should be another 9/11 Commission, he said: "There should be fifteen 9/11 Commissions!!!"

http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2014/07/911-commissions-forum-shows-dc-works-4.html 









 there's nothing wrong with working at an apple store...but Thomas Drake was a legitimate whistleblower who was forced to incur huge legal bills while being stripped of his lifetime profession as an intelligence analyst...Thomas Drake is most likely making a fraction of the income/benefits that he was making inside the pentagon. In the end, if I remember correctly, Thomas Drake was forced to plead guilty to a lesser charge--just to make the case go away and take the stress and financial pressure of endless legal bills off.... 




 Thomas Drake was still FUCKED by the system--he is now working at an apple store (after a lifetime in u.s. intelligence)...so don't sugarcoat that shit they threw at him...

-------

Full Letter: http://consortiumnews.com/2014/01/07/nsa-insiders-reveal-what-went-wrong/

------------------

"The sadder reality, Mr. President, is that NSA itself had enough information to prevent 9/11, but chose to sit on it rather than share it with the FBI or CIA. We know; we were there. We were witness to the many bureaucratic indignities that made NSA at least as culpable for pre-9/11 failures as are other U.S. intelligence agencies...

...My first day on the job at NSA was 9/11. I was immediately charged as the lead NSA executive to find and deploy the best technology at NSA for the fight against terrorism....

...Thats where I found the pre- and post-9/11 intelligence from NSA monitoring of some of the hijackers as they planned the attacks of 9/11 had not been shared outside NSA. This includes critical pre-9/11 intelligence on al-Qaeda, even though it had been worked on by NSA analysts. I learned, for example, that in early 2001 NSA had produced a critical long-term analytic report unraveling the entire heart of al-Qaeda and associated movements. That report also was not disseminated outside of NSA.

Make no mistake. That data and the analytic report could have, should have prevented 9/11...

...In short, when confronted with the prospect of fessing up, NSA chose instead to obstruct the 9/11 congressional investigation, play dumb, and keep the truth buried, including the fact that it knew about all inbound and outbound calls to the safe house switchboard in Yemen. NSAs senior leaders took me off the task because they realized  belatedly, for some reason  that I would not take part in covering up the truth about how much NSA knew but did not share.

When the 9/11 Commission hearings began, Director Hayden chortled at executive staff meetings over the fact that the FBI and CIA were feeling the heat for not having prevented 9/11. This was particularly difficult for me to sit through, for I was aware that NSA had been able to cover up its own culpability by keeping investigators, committees, and commissions away from the truth."

"So what if we tried to OVERTHROW the Venezuelan government. 

That's what the CIA does--OVERTHROW governments who don't bend over for our corporations.

How can our embassy serve with only 17 on staff??? How are we supposed to recruit and train mercenaries for the next operation???

This is impossible...Randolph, get Langley on the phone--now!!!"

In 1950, the u.s. had about 300 nuclear weapons, by 1960 the u.s. had over 18,000 nuclear weapons. Good thing Ike was there to stop the MIC from getting out of hand!?! 




 I pointed this out on wednesday...in my own softspoken style 

http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2x4ke5/anyone_notice_it_wasnt_a_local_chicago_news_paper/ 




 I first watched this over a year ago...now it seems even more true--especially the part about the "war on terrorisism" being FAKE...

http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2xizds/think_about_it_the_cia_was_most_likely_involved/ 









 For me, one of the most intriguing items I've come across is the fact that the CIA was most likely involved in the planning of the World Trade Center--going all the way back to before 1960. This fact changes the manner in which the WTC complex should be looked at: as a CIA built asset which the Agency surely used in many ways unknown to the citizens and occupants of the WTC complex. It has shifted my thinking a bit towards Larry Silverstein being more of a victim than a planner. More importantly, by seeing the WTC as a CIA asset and creation--the questions about access to the WTC to pre-install explosives fades away. It inherently implies the WTC was a financial center for the CIA since the early 70's when the towers opened up, and that the destruction of the WTC complex may have been an intentional good-bye to financial records of the CIA from the 1970's on. We also know Enron had CIA connections and benefitted from the destruction of the WTC complex (which included the SEC office). Was Enron just the tip of the iceberg?

There is no doubt about the Rockefeller-CIA connections--but it is hard to come across articles which research this issue. I went thru the indexes of books by Peter Dale Scott, Michael Ruppert, Kevin Ryan, Russ Baker, Tim Weiner, Joseph Trento--not much there! Russ Baker did have an eye-catching paragraph which shows the power the Rockefellers had over the president of the united states:

----

(page 310, Family of Secrets)

Less well known is that David and Nelson Rockefeller used the takeover as a pretext to prevent the Iranian revolutionaries from withdrawing petrodollars from the Chase Manhattan Bank in London, where the shah kept most of his assets. According to several thoughtful accounts, the shah's looted billions were crucial to Chase's then shaky finances. Their withdrawal could have precipitated an international financial crisis. The hostage crisis then provided a justification for the Carter administration, under pressure from Rockefeller interests, to seize all of Iran's assets.

The only other bits and pieces I've found were from:

1) ["On the Trail of the Assassins" by Jim Garrison:](http://np.reddit.com/r/911truth/comments/2suotr/was_the_nyc_world_trade_center_created_by_the_cia/) One paragraph from this book started me thinking about this possibility...

2) [Maurice Phillip's research](http://somesecretsforyou.blogspot.com/2010/10/permindex-cia-link.html)

John Kerry might have said it best: "If you're smart, you graduate high school and go to college...if not, you end up in the military." 




 its definitely a tactic...they also do things to make searches difficult as well... 




 Lots of people will end up DEAD under U.S. bombs in Iraq as the defense industry executives celebrate by attending killer toy conventions in between rounds of golf with some generals...u.s. pilots will rejoice in their higher kill ratios and receive nylon award ribbons in a plastic display box to show off to their families how they flew a $100 million aircraft and dropped bombs on people who had no airforce...

if all goes as planned, the u.s. will have boots on the ground in Syria by the end of summer--and some psychopath at the cia will take photos over Assad's dead body as they attempt to identify whatever remains...YES, overthrow of Syria is the goal at the pentagon and the cia--they have been trying since 1949!!!

 Youtube does this quite often to 9/11 related videos--especially ones that get a large number of views...I noticed youtube take down "Press For Truth" when it had a high number of views--the doc was put back up but without the 1 million+ number of views...

still, it would be great to send off some letters to one of the youtube squareheads and let them know how much more their product sucks ass than it did 5 years ago. 




 also contains a link to Painful Deceptions by Eric Hufschnid--an early book/slideshow which questioned 9/11...pretty interesting to view if you haven't scrolled it before...

 I was thinking that the Dept. of Defense should change their name back to the World War 2 name: the War Department...

but **Eternal War Department** could fit...or maybe just **WAR, INC.** 














 well, fuck...shit--that was HARD WORK...what was it 2 or 3 days for firstlook to get some relevant fucking info on this place? (and get it approved by their corporate attorneys)

meanwhile, the fucking sycophants over at the Chicago Tribune and the Chicago Sun-Times continue to give the fucking CPD a FREE PASS on this one--even though the CPD has a DARK fucking history...(look up John Burge if you want to know more)...

this story shows Exactly what is wrong with the fucking u.s. corporate sycophantic press--an entire CPD building operating OFF the Fucking Record for fucking YEARS...local press don't give a FUCK--it takes an article from fucking England to break this story...if this doesn't show YOU why we all need to begin to take action against the u.s. corporate presstitutes, then nothing will.

 I think the U.S. should apoligize to Iraq and LEAVE...over a decade of useless war stirred up by the sloppy u.s. overthrow and invasion which has cost TRILLIONS...millions of Iraqi lives ruined because the Neocons at the Pentagon wanted to take over the Middle East...at what point DO YOU consider this GENOCIDE? Our tax dollars are being used to ruin Iraq, Afghanistan--where the US has also installed Puppet Regimes that can only be held in place with US military presence...

Michael Hastings quoted a 2008 RAND study which was interesting: they studied over 600 terrorist organizations since 1968--only 7% of the organizations came to an end via military action...43% of the groups came to a political settlement...40% were ended via local law enforcement-intelligence actions...another item Hastings brought up was what Gen. McChrystal called "Afghan Math"...if there are ten insurgents and you kill two--you may end up with twenty insurgents...so, 10-2 does not equal 8...10-2 equals twenty...yet, the u.s. persists in dronings and air strikes...

why did the u.s. invade Afghanistan, pay warlords to chase UBL, then allow UBL to get away into Pakistan? then they paid Pakistan $3 billion a year in "military aid"...ten years later they raided UBL in Pakistan..

what a FARCE!!!

 I remember back in 2002 when Dick Cheney predicted the Iraq War would cost $85 Billion "if everything went well."

He was only off by a few TRILlION dollars.

http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_cost_of_the_Iraq_War

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/9961877/Cost-to-US-of-Iraq-and-Afghan-wars-could-hit-6-trillion.html

 




 how many more Iraqis will lose their lives under u.s. bombs? the last estimate i saw counted over 3 million Iraqis dead due to u.s.-u.k. military actions and sanctions since 1990...how many more refugees will there be? what if things get out of control and the u.s. ends up with boots on the ground in Syria? it seems like this is all about overthrowing Assad to me. 














 don't worry--the u.s. will pay for some mercenaries, too...

...and we all KNOW this is just leading to an all-out invasion of Syria (and the overthrow of Assad)...the u.s., the pentagon and the CIA have been drooling over that!!! 




 So, you didn't realize that Cheney and Rummy split that missing $2.3 Trillion?  




 I remember when Shrimp Dick Cheney said the Iraq War would only cost $75 Billion--if things go as planned.

 Urban fighting is the most sophisticated, complex fight there is, Mr. Barbero said. Multidimensional. Its direct fire. Indirect fire. Precision fires. If you want to gain support from the occupants, the Sunnis, you cant go in there and just run with it. So it has to be a very, very precise application of firepower against an enemy that has no regard for the population and will indiscriminately use violence to hold on. Theres no way the Iraqi Security Forces will be ready for this kind of fighting.

 I used to buy the NYT--but now I realize how often they OMIT stories and how many NYT writers have moved on...Chris Hedges, Tim Weiner, Stephen Kinzer...the NYT held up James Risen's big scoop on the wrireless overreaches of the Bush administration for over a year before Risen went out and got a book contract--then the NYT finally published his story (which won a Pulitzer...finally)...now I see the NYT as a dolled up disinformation campaign with nice fashion, antiques, and auction updates... 




 guardian article:

 "It is every citizen's first responsibility to question the government."

--Ben Franklin, *Conspiracist* 




 good...after years of not having cable tv--my mind has finally erased those evil fucking bastards!!! 




 of course I wasn't implying the mayoral election isn't news--but I could literally scream from the number of times the front page has been infiltrated with Wrigley Field rehab updates instead of, say, how the Pentagon has Never submitted to an AUDIT...the Trib, the NYT, cnn, cbs, abc, nbc--they have all FAiLED to investigate and question--and given a Free Pass all too often...the "news" papers/media now resort to asking the DOJ before printing an article on Edward Snowden or the Patriot Act...the scariest thing is that Americans believe this vacuous reporting--at least in Russia the citizens know they are being lied to

and, YES, I would be happy to see the Chicago Tribune go OUT OF BUSINESS--the editors and publishers FAILED to protect the public interest long ago... 




 I grew up reading the Chicago Tribune...in 2nd or 3rd grade my school began a reading program where we read the paper twice a week...I have studied the de-evolution of the Tribune, how it has become a vacuous chatterbox for corporate interests and become nothing but an unofficial Propaganda Wurlitzer for the Pentagon. 

Sports is an entertainment that has become elevated to distract citizens from what is really important--the Tribune has regularly taken the top portion of their front page (which used to be devoted to "hard news") and used it to promote these vacuous "news" stories (mostly sports, sports, tv, movies and...sports)....

i would challenge you to take a sheet of paper and write down every Chicago athlete you know--MLB, NFL, NBA, etc...now write down every Chicago local, state or federal politician you know...which list is much, much longer? 




 i would urge you to quit giving the msm your business--even watching, viewing or reading them continues the cycle of disinformation which the msm has become accustomed to feeding its readers...even by watching cnn, msnbc, abc, cbs (etc.) you are paying them to misinform you (the cable companies pay every channel a portion of your bill, the companies also gain ad revenue offf of their number of viewers)...the corporate msm has failed to be the 4th estate, they have failed to seek the truth and bowed to their corporate masters...the Trillions of dollars of the Iraq-Afghanistan Wars have become more important than reporting actual facts...

 




 the guardian--all the way from England...(they have NYC office, too)

someone kindly posted a link below... 




 First of all, the "news" has become limited to issues which do not question the government. Take for example, the Iraq War and the "Free Pass" the u.s. press gave Bush-Cheney. The publishers and editors have decided they will not upset the readers with stories which make the readers Think...the Chicago Tribune, on a daily basis, updates its readers with sports, tv, movies ON THE FRONT PAGE...I would bet the Tribune has more sports writers than it has writers covering national security...what is REALLY news?  The Tribune has become just an unofficial u.s. state department-pentagon Chatterbox which simply regurgitates the latest press release and fails to investigate to uncover Real facts...

link to today's front page of the Chicago Tribune: 

http://www1.newseum.org/todaysfrontpages/hr.asp?fpVname=IL_CT ref_pge=gal b_pge=5 




 news is comprised of articles which affect the lives of the readers--political, economic, legal issues...

the Chicago Tribune, for the last decade, has devoted part of its front page to sports, movies, food, tv...its no wonder they didn't break this important story--the Tribune is too busy with sports and entertainment to have noticed...I would even bet that the Tribune has more sports reporters than it does Chicago news reporters...in any case, this story is just another example of how corporate u.s. media FAILS to seek the Truth and expose it...

 nice..i thought Grover sounded more like a project which started from Darpa...

.funny how i won't read WaPo anymore--but crazy late nite comments...Hell Yeah 




 i thought that was just some odd bitcoin reference...llamacoin makes another Loftus reference in those posts... 




 Helms was DCI from summer of 1966 to Feb. 1973...so a 1973 tape of a retired Helms could be pretty interesting...Helms became known for talking too much on Capital Hill during the house-senate investigations of the 70's... 




 in the comments by BillCaseyHoneyPot it said that Goss was lucky to be alive because "Roman" is still around...I was just looking at that photo of what is supposed to be Porter Goss with members of Operation 40 (which has Frank Sturgis covering his face and Goss sitting nect to Felix Rodriguez) 




 Zabiullah Mujahid is mentioned--quite the wiki profile...

http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zabiullah_Mujahid 




 nice catch with the SK...certainly could be mindless rantings of someone who thinks he's Kim Philby... 




 1. is GROVER...what is it? a satellite or computer system that sweeps everything?

2. is the 3/4" audio tape from 1973: seems to be a reference to Nixon-era White House recordings--we know there was quite a bit erased from what was finally released to public...including a 10 minute segment

3. LOFTUS seems to be a computer

4. SR-91...what is it? a satellite? u.s. or russian?

fyi: u/SargeantForbin posted a slideshare which shows the original cryptome link (below)...it wasn't a capture of the wapo page--it was just a re-typing of the comments by BillCaseyHoneyPot

 




 thanks for pasting...i'm surprised this didn't get more upvotes--pretty friggin' crazy!!! 




 supposedly, ISI helped set that up...the ISI chief was in Wash, DC on 9/11 with PorterGoss, Bob Graham...after 9/11 an article from India pegged the ISI chief as having a money trail to one of the hijackers--so the ISI chief stepped down...

there was plenty more....including a long code, about 20 (numbers and capital letters) which was listed...BillCaseyHoneyPot was being a bit taunting--unclear if it was a joke or whatnot...strange that the comments have been scrubbed from wa po and now cryptome is down and the link 404'd...

 i'm just half-way thru the book...but in 1951 the defense budget was $13.5 billion...in 1953 it was $50 billion...the Airforce also demanded fleets of planes for the nuclear weapons as well...by the mid50's the u.s. was capable of keeping 1/3 of its B-47 and B-52 fleets in the air at all times...(made possible thru air refeuling)...the u.s. had hundreds of air refueling planes...this was done in case the u.s. should be attacked by by russia with nuclear weapons--the u.s. could only assure a response if planes were in the air...
so you could definitely say, the u.s. military doesn't give a damn about the environment...we are still dealing with nuclear waste storage problems--which the corporate media won't cover (its in new mexico)... 









 the world trade center was created by the CIA and David Rockefeller...WTC 1 and WTC 2 had asbestos problems and were expendable--more useful as a modern Reichstag Fire than as the obsolete Two Front Teeth of America...WTC 7 contained offices for the CIA, the Secret Service and the SEC...see r/911truth for a link to "The New Pearl Harbor" (the best documentary on 9/11--the final two hours cover the Twin Towers)...

After completing the new manual, Patreus gets picked to return to Iraq to put his revamped theory to the test. He asks for twenty thousand more troops and gets them, increasing the overall number of forces  in Iraq to a hundred and fifty thousand, or a 15 percent increase. What follows is eighteen months of brutal fighting, at the cost of over one thousand American lives and over ten thousand Iraqis killed. Behind the scenes, McChrystal, operating his own Phoenix-like Special Ops program, wipes out "thousands," according to McChrystal's deputy, Major General Bill Mayville, noting that "jSOC was a killing machine." Violence does, however, eventually decline, and Patreus--and counterinsurgency--is able to take credit for creating the conditions for a face-saving withdrawal. COIN, it appears, is fully vindicated. The surge becomes a modern military myth, one eagerly embraced in Washington by those in the media and political world who'd been complicit in starting the Iraq War.

A closer inspection of the surge myth reveals a murkier set of factors. One of the major turning points in the war is in Anbar province, when local tribal leaders decide to turn against Al Qaeda. This starts happening a year before Patreus returns to command and has little to do with American military strategy. Analysis crediting the turnaround in Anbar usually ignores the reason why Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) was able to establish a foothold there in the first place: American bungling for the first three years of the war. The tribal leaders welcomed Al-Qaeda to fight the American occupiers, but then realized they'd made a significant tactical error. Al Qaeda in Iraq eclipsed the American occupation in brutality and stupidity--as one tribal leader would say, he would have "worked with the devil" to beat Al Qaeda. The tribal leaders realized that they weren't just fighting the Americans--the new Shiite-led government in Baghdad was also keen to wipe them out. Faced with the brutality of AQI, coupled with a sectarian cleansing campaign originating from the highest levels of the new government in Baghdad, the tribal leaders, mainly Sunnis, make a desperate play: They tell the Americans that for the right price, they'd partner with them. American soldiers start to hand out bags of cash to insurgents--about $360 million spent in just one year. Overnight, former enemies who had killed Americans for three years became "freedom fighters." ("They are true Iraqi patriots," as one American general will describe his former enemies.) We find a way to buy off the enemies we'd created by invading--the strategy is akin to digging a hole in the desert, then filling the hole with cash and dead bodies and calling it a victory.

Jake came up to me. "We'll hunt you down and kill you if we don't like what you write," he said. "C. will hunt you down and kill you."

[note: Jake McFerren is General McChrystal's top civilian political advisor responsible for helping foster international relations with the 44 coalition countries involved in Afghanistan. Jake was also McChrystal's West Point roommate and drinking buddy....C. was a member of the SAS, the most elite British commando unit]

(page 88)

"Sorry about threatening to kill you," Jake said. It was the first time anyone in the group had acknowledged the blowout on Friday night. 

"Yeah, geez, the guy is just trying to do his job," McChrystal said. 

"No worries. Like I said, it happens all the time, but yeah, you're probably the highest rank to do so," I said.

I laughed, and they didn't.

(page 73-74)

Over the past year, journalists had regularly been given intimate access to McChrystal and his staff.  A reporter for the New York Times spent a few days in Kabul with him, producing a profile that found McChrystal's only fault was that he worked so hard, "he sometimes affords little tolerance for those who do not."  He described his running habits: "eight miles a clip, usually with an audiobook at his ears."  A writer for the Atlantic had enjoyed a good stay, writing an article titled "Man Versus Afghanistan."  He asked if McChrystal was Afghanistan's only hope. He found reason to believe: "eight miles a day, eating only one meal a day, and sleeping four hours a night--itself expresses an unyielding, almost cultic, determination."  Time magazine had put him as runner-up for Person of the Year, opening with an anecdote about a competitive "eight to ten mile" run he had with General Patreus. 60 Minutes spent the most personal time with him: He allowed them to film while he was jogging around the base. They'd all told the same story:McChrystal as a modern combination of saint and ninja, a "Jedi Knight," as Newsweek called him. 

-------

(page 75)

As a country, we'd changed since Vietnam--the ghost McChrystal and his generation of military leaders desperately wanted to exorcize. The fear that their wars, too, could end in disgrace: "It's not going to look like a win, smell like a win, or taste like a win," Major General Bill Mayville, McChrystal's director of operations, would tell me. "This is going to end in an argument." An argument they were determined to win. One of the first books McChrystal read after arriving in Kabul was Stanley Karnow's "Vietnam: A History."  McChrystal called the author to ask if there were any lessons that would apply to Afghanistan.  "The main thing I learned is that we never should have been there in the first place," Karnow reportedly told him. It wasn't what the general wanted to hear.

-----

(page 76)

The lesson our leaders took from Vietnam was not, it turns out, how to avoid another Vietnam.  It was how to seal off the horror: to ensure that only a small group felt and saw it. An all volunteer military, and a further reliance on the most elite, specialized soldiers to do the nation's work we prefer to ignore.  Entering houses at midnight and shooting unarmed men while they sleep. A widespread acceptance of drone strikes, killings committed by remote control--McChrystal watched a man on a videofeed in his headquarters for 17 days before he ordered the strike on a compound to kill Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. He went to see the dead man's body: the pictures of the corpse were displayed at a press conference, a modern day version of putting a man's head on a spike.

------

(page 110)

I had downtime to digest the reporting. A question persisted: What was the motivation behind McChrystal's decision to have me tag along? Was it that Rolling Stone would reach a demographic of young officers and recruits they wanted to impress? Would it confirm the view that the team held of McChrystal--that he was a "rock star," as they regularly called him? Dave explained that Special Forces operators had a healthy disrespect for authority; Rolling Stone fit this self-styled image perfectly. They were building Brand McChrystal--ballsy, envelope-pushing, risk taking. New York Times Magazine cover? Done. Time cover? Done. Atlantic cover? Too easy. 60 Minutes profile? No worries. Rolling Stone? Boom. It was a natural evolution of a very aggressive media strategy to establish McChrystal as a contender for the greatest general of his generation, on a par with Patreus.

(pages 142-143)

Insurgents are Afghans. What is essential for success is not to kill the insurgents, because they are the Afghan people. If you kill the insurgency, you kill the Afghan people you came to protect, and there's nobody left to win over. 

If you kill two out of ten insurgents, you don't end up with eight insurgents. You might end up multiplying the number of fighters aligned against you. McChrystal calls it "Insurgent Math." If you kill two, he said, "more likely you're going to have something like twenty. Those two that were killed, their relatives don't understand that they're doing bad things. Okay, they think. a foreigner just killed my brother--I got to fight them."

Afghan Math: 10  - 2= 8 (wrong)...10 - 2= 20 (right)

-------

(page 205)

The manual performs a rather impressive sleight of hand: tying counterinsurgency to the War on Terror. The vast majority of the fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan is not against any combatant who poses a threat to the United States homeland. But to justify the tremendous outlay of resources and lives it requires to enact a counterinsurgency plan, the theories claim that COIN, somehow, is an effective way to deal with transnational terrorist groups like Al-Qaeda. That this is patently false does not give the movement much pause. A RAND study "How Terrorists Groups End," commissioned in 2008, explicitly points out that the best way to defeat terrorist networks is not through military force, but through law enforcement. The authors looked at 648 terrorist groups that were active from 1968 to 2006. In 40 percent of the cases, policing is "the most effective strategy," with local intelligence and police agencies able to penetrate and disrupt the terror groups, while 43 percent reached a political accommodation with the government. The study states: "Military force led to the end of terrorist groups in 7 percent of the cases," and that military force has not "significantly undermined (Al-Qaeda's) abilities."

 So, what ever happened to the bbcs program about 9/11 that was going to use ALL satellite images??? the bbc announced it last year--but havent seen it posted...

 The Guantanamo Bay lease is fucking ILLEGAL--any fucking judge in the USA would throw that lease out of court because it is a PERPETUAL lease (it has **NO END DATE**)... 




 YES...I do have a problem with allowing the CIA/U.S. military forces to be judge, jury and executioner for the people of the world.

YES I do have a problem when the CIA-US military KILL and KILL and KILL so corporations can PROFIT 




 Obama is responsible for the hundreds of drone strikes he has ordered around the globe..(each drone strike IS an act of war) 




 So what do you call it when the USA steals Guantanamo Bay from Cuba?

What do you call it when the USA overthrows the Queen of Hawaii and takes Hawaii?

What do you call it when the CIA pumps in millions of dollars to back political parties in Italy?

What do you call it when the USA bombs and bombs and bombs other smaller countries around the world?

 will most definitely check it out--thanks for taking the time to write the insightful comment...i've actually wanted to see that movie for quite a while...

 




 Was the NYC World Trade Center created by the CIA back in the 1960's???

I recently purchased a copy of "On the Trail of the Assassins" by Jim Garrison (1988 edition, paperback).  I knew the Oliver Stone movie was based on this book--so I was glad to part with the 25 cents the book was priced at.  I'm pretty familiar with the JFK whack job, so there wasn't anything too surprising until I got to page 100--the last paragraph reads: 

According to these articles, the CIA--which apparently had been conducting its own foreign policy for some time--had begun a project in Italy as far back as the early 1960's. The organization, named the Centro Mondiale Commerciale (the World Trade Center), had initially been formed in Montreal, then moved to Rome in 1961. Among the members of its board of directors, we learned, was one Clay Shaw from New Orleans.

So, the CIA seemed to be actively creating "World Trade Centers" around the globe so the CIA could conduct under the radar financial transactions. This money was going to back political parties in Italy--what other types of tranactions were being conducted? Very likely the CIA wanted these "World Trade Centers" for their ever-expanding series of front companies which often dealt with black market money from drug sales and arms dealing. Those of us who have read Peter Dale Scott (or some Michael Ruppert) are quite familiar with the accusations that the OSS/CIA have long-standing drug and mafia links going back to WWII. Possibly, the CIA very early on began to realize the illegal monies gained in the black markets were the easiest way to fund all of their other subversive activities--with the added bonus of NOT having any oversight by those pesky politicians (who don't need to know CIA business anyways). 

Interesting to note that the NYC WTC used eminent domain to take over the grounds on which the WTC would be built on--this could be assured with CIA backing. We know Rockerfeller had deep CIA connections. Agency man Phillip Agee claimed his first task in the CIA was to do background checks on employees of Rockerfeller's Standard Oil. Rockerfeller also had much to do with the planning of the WTC in NYC. Was the NYC WTC, from the beginning, designed as a CIA front? 

The biggest reason Jim Garrison lost the Clay Shaw trial was because he counldn't definitively link Clay Shaw and the CIA. We now know that Clay Shaw was, in fact, heavily involved with the CIA. After Clay Shaw's death in 1974, Richard Helms was called before the House Sub-Committee on Assassinations and testified that Clay Shaw was involved with the CIA. "On the Trail of the Assassins" also goes on to show the CIA creating Centro Mondiale Commerciales around the globe in the early 60's--I can just imagine Allen Dulles traveling and contacting his endless supply of men like George De Mohrenschildt and Clay Shaw...the book also notes how Clay Shaw's operation was shut down in Italy for "espionage activities" in 1962. So, the CIA knew these fronts were risky and must be considered expendable at a moments notice.

You may also be able to view pages 100-104 of Jim Garrison's book on google--it does give some more background...I would type the pages in but i am on my ipad travelling...

 amazing that Ruppert wrote this in 2001-2002 (over 100 points)...most likely the Putin interview has been erased from the record...

 The Pentagon spends BILLIONS of dollars every year on Public Relations...

So, it is certainly within reason that the Pentagon-CIA would make some distractions.

(Check Michael Hastings article where he states the Pentagon spends $5 billion per year on PR...it was in Rolling Stone...on my phone--otherwise i'd post link) 




 **CONTAGION**

That one word speaks volumes for how the Pentagon views any individual or group which does not support the political, economic and military goals inside the Pentagon/CIA. 

Anyone who has not yet read Tim Weiner's *Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CiA* or Stephen Kinzer's *Overthrow: America's Century of Regime Change from Hawaii to Iraq* should do so immediately.  
 




 May as well put a FOR SALE sign on the Statue of Liberty, too. 




 Good question--the CIA has an Inspector General who investigates within...In 2004 the IG CIA released a report--but its been such a long, convoluted, twisting story I have no idea if that report is the same as the 6,300 page 2009 Report...the 6,300 page report needed to be whittled down--so the Senate Select Cmte on Intelligence (SSCI) decided to pay CIA-approved attorneys $40 million to splice, dice and redact the report so it could be released to the SERFS of America. As a bonus, the SSCI gave the CIA-approved attorneys 4 years to do so. 

http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/torture_archive/index_ig.htm

In any case, this has been dragging on for over a decade. The first articles looking into systemic torture by the CIA-US military came out in 2002.

--former CIA Director George Tenet while promoting his fucking book

(awarded Presidential Medal of Freedom by GW Bush)
 




 I highly doubt that the all too complicit pack of Puppets which calls itself the US press allowed GW Bush just 4 questions and under 3 minutes of time in which to question the president on a regular basis. 




 It certainly could be that GWB was just a puppet put in place so Cheney could run his evil operations while GWB played it like a bumbling, innocent FOOL. 




 Even more frightening is the *executive power* which VP Dick Cheney carved out under the POTUS--the extreme secrecy and wide range of illegal actions was (partially) exposed in Barton Gellmans book *ANGLER: The Cheney Vice Presidency*. 

But, yes, I would definitely agree that it is insulting to Americans how much Bush/Cheney were able to keep hidden. Seems to be one of the larger ironies: 9/11 was the standard answer to everything, yet they couldnt stand in front of the public and answer questions under oath to the 9/11 Commission.  




 Pretty sure I saw the Crown or Pritzker (sp?) names caught up in the TAX HAVEN stories which broke out last year (and were overwhelmingly IGNORED by the establishment media). 

http://www.icij.org/blog/2012/11/offshore-world-allows-some-play-outside-rules 




 Opening Statement: The Vice President and I just finished a...a, um--a good conversation with the 9-1-1 Commission. It was wide-ranging. It was, uh, important. Uh, it was, uh, it was just a good discussion and I really, I appreciate the members, um...I want to thank the chairman and the vice-chairman for bringing the commission here...and, uh, giving us a chance to share views on different subjects...and they had a lot of good questions...and, uh, Im glad I did it, Im glad I took the time. Its an important commission, and its important that, uh, they ask the questions they ask so they can help make recommendations necessary to better protect our homeland. It was a--I enjoyed it. Let me ask--answer--a few questions...

-----------------

Interesting that GW Bush couldnt even complete his FIRST sentence: after he says the vice president and I just finished a... Bush pauses before he can find the right word. Bush can only use a very broad word to describe 
the conversation because Bush and Cheney were not placed under oath during the conversation. 

Interesting that Bush comes out by HIMSELF, without Cheney--is this designed to fool everyone? 

The other interesting bit of Bushs opening statement is that he shakes his head side-to-side (which means NO) before he says the words better protect our homeland.

GW Bush then goes on to answer 3 questions and rudely tell a 4th reporter that he already answered his question yesterday.

If the 9/11 Commission was so important--why did it take Bush so long to, Not Testify--but have a conversation" with them? Why is the press conference last only 5 minutes afterwards? Why are only 4 questions asked?

There are more interesting moments during the 4 Question Press Conference--what can you find?

----------

While I was trying to find the full press conference, I checked C-Span. First I searched for video Bush 9/11 Commission...here is what pops up: http://www.c-span.org/search/?searchtype=Videos query=bush+9%2F11+commission+

I then made my search more specific and searched for video Bush 4/29/2004--still NO GW Bush press conference!!!

WHY are they REMOVING this EVIDENCE from the record? (its available on youtube thanks to researchers like Jon Gold)...You can literally find thousands of GW Bush videos--but anything to do with 9/11 Commission seems to be missing INTENTIONALLY from the record...Isnt that what CRIMINALS do--remove or destroy evidence???
Anyone who has looked into this can see a much longer pattern of the Vice President and the President attempting to obstruct or disrupt the investigations looking into 9/11...

In addition to UNDERFUNDING the 9/11 Commission, the Bush-Cheney war criminals also acted quickly to Cover Up the evidence and impede any meaningful investigation...

+ The government shipped much of the WTC steel (aka the evidence) to China and India to be recycled ASAP (isnt that what criminals do--destroy evidence?)...

+ Within 10 days, the government was looking to pay off the victims relatives and forcing them to sign confidentiality agreements in order to receive money from the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund...the families were also given a strict deadline in which to make their decision.

+ Dick Cheney asked Sen. Tom Daschle NOT to investigate 9/11 on several occasions. (Sen. Daschle was on the Joint Intelligence Inquiry into 9/11).

+ GW Bush wouldnt testify to the 9/11 Commission UNDER OATH and BEFORE THE PUBLIC (hes just the President--what did you expect?)...

+ The 9/11 Commission Co-Chairmen wrote an editorial in the *New York Times* claiming the investigation was obstructed by the CIA and the White House.



 









 I heard some guys brag about TORTURING people...do you want their names, too?

Dick Cheney seemed to be leading the pack... 




 GREAT point...The Gary Webb allegations have to be re-analyzed.

Never really thought about this before, but didnt the laws against marijuana come into play in 1937...2 years after alcohol was legalized.

The War on Drugs made our prisons madhouses and had extremely negative effects on many other countries as well...

 YES, the war profiteers couldnt figure out how to go back to a peace time economy--it seemed much easier to spread some fear to get the war machines turning again. The 6 paragraphs that Andrew Cockburn wrote were pretty shocking to read when I first came across them (linked above). 




 McClatchy (sic?) News reported these last spring--article was quickly taken down and an investigation into leaks ensued...somone copy/pasted to document cloud before the article was expunged... 




 Very sound argument, although I would go back a bit further--back to the 1947 National Security Act which renamed the War Department, centralized the military and created the CIA. There is quite a bit of evidence that the Cold War was played like a drum by the Pentagon and sent over the CIAs Wurlitzer...

 Zegart was really quite serious with her research--wish she had given the comment a bit more context by indicating if the person was serious or half-joking (its on page 4). 

Thanks for the great AMA!!! 




 I was shocked by the 2nd part of the quote...

One legislator who served on a congressional intelligence committee called oversight horrible and said that improving even the intelligence budget process would mean that somebody in Congress would have to die.


 




 I guess there used to be 8 Congressional Committees who handled different aspects of the oversight--it was cut back to just 2 Committees around 1980 I think--supposedly due to committee members leaking info. As for Congress doing its job--I came across this shocking quote:

-----------

Another senior intelligence official noted that oversight had deteriorated so much during his career that I dont even know what good oversight looks like anymore.[12] Overseers agreed. One legislator who served on a congressional intelligence committee called oversight horrible and said that improving even the intelligence budget process would mean that somebody in Congress would have to die.

Amy B. Zegart (2011): The Roots of Weak Congressional Intelligence Oversight 

http://www.hoover.org/sites/default/files/research/docs/futurechallenges_zegart.pdf

 Any thoughts on the seemingly complete loss of Congressional Oversight of the intelligence agencies? (Runaway NSA, CIA spying on SSCI, FBI-NSA spying on Senator Frank Church, Barton Gellman reported in his book that Cheney receives NSA printouts on State Dept. officials, Russ Tice allegations, etc.)

 




 I wouldnt doubt it if my posts in r/worldnews (and other major subs) are eyeballed and brigaded (most likely by humans!). Techniques seem to be: downvotes, comments using negative language which have nothing to do with my comment, stacking comments above mine which results in my comment being pushed down, the entire article/post being erased by mod or user...

Of course this isnt happening every time I post a comment or link--but one day I think these techniques were used on me in 3 consecutive comments I made. A large part of it is the subjective enforcement of the rules which the mods in the larger subreddits censor the articles with. 

Articles questioning authority (Pentagon, CIA) seem to be stricken from the record. I feel this is dangerous--imagine if the MSM had allowed more voices of dissent in the run up to the Iraq invasion in 2003. 




 Thanks for the info--Im just making my way thru Alfred McCoys *A Question of Torture* which reviews the history of the CIAs interrogation/torture experiments. I dont ever remember hearing about the Capitol building incident from 1983...WOW.

I read Beverly Gages book *The Day Wall Street Exploded* last year. She included Notes on Sources which is quite detailed and clear in that she was Shut Down in her attempt for new info the US government had on the 1920 Wall Street bombing. Gage did recently strike some GOLD though--a few weeks ago the *NYT* published her article on how she found the UNREDACTED FBI-MLK Suicide Letter. (She found it at the National Archives while doing research on J. Edgar Hoover) 




 Sprey was right about nations walking away from the F-35...last week, the UK just placed another huge" order--for FOUR more F-35s (Ill bet they would order LESS of them if they could)...

 Buckley was on the debate team at Yale, so YES he's formidable. I definitely found some of his statements to be wild--youre 100% right about the I dont care who killed Kennedy statement. 

It appears to me that Buckley used his into of Mark Lane to paint him with the Left Liberal corner. Buckley then asks his first question: 

-------------

WB: Id like to begin by asking Mr. Lane this: it is widely alleged that sinister forces who have a vested interest in suppressing the real truth as to the identity of the assassin have been here and they are killing off crucial people--former strippers at Rubys joint in Dallas, a truck driver, roommates of Oswalds--that kind of thing. How come if you were the man who has changed history, these forces havent bumped you off?

---------------

*have been here* 

HERE seems very out of place.

Buckley is obviously working with notes--this seems an outlandish question to open the interview with. I think Buckley was trying to knock Mark Lane off balance from the start. Didnt work!! 




 Ive watched this 4 or 5 times now--each time through I notice more. Youre definitely spot on about Buckleys darting eyes--it looks like he intends physical harm to Mark Lane at some points (on the split screen). 

Not familiar with the NLP reference--but surely it makes an impression when Buckley mentions the Soviets, then physically acts out pressing a button--then goes on to mention Oswald and he (Buckley) holds out his hands as if he was shooting a rifle. 

There are also points where Buckleys EARS move--I think this may be from tightening the jaw...is this a sign of anger?

Never knew about Mark Lane getting caught up in the Jonestown mess.

Havent watched the Baldwin-Buckley debate yet. It is worth mentioning that the U.S. painted communism/socialism as an Evil Menace in a much more pronounced and effective manner than in England. Many of the labor strikes of the early 20th century blamed the violence on socialists. There was also the [Wall Street bombing of 1920](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_bombing) which was blamed on socialists--with very little hard evidence. In fact, in 2009 a Yale American History professor, Beverly Gage, wrote a book about the incident--and was unable to get any additional files released for her book--almost 90 years later. 
 




 [William F.Buckley, Jr.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_F._Buckley,_Jr.): Skull   Bones at Yale--where he was also an informer for the FBI...in 1951 Buckley was recruited by the CIA and worked with E. Howard Hunt--including 1 year in Mexico City...founded the *National Review* in 1955...

Be great if someone could help make some observations and analyze their meaning...

Within the first 7 minutes Buckley also impersonates Oswald and holds out his hands like he has a rifle and shoots it...

 Never heard about these pre-9/11 raids either...

-----------------------

September 5-8, 2001: Raid on Arab Web Hosting Company Precedes 9/11 Attacks  

The US Joint Terrorism Task Force conducts a three-day raid of the offices of InfoCom Corporation, a Texas-based company that hosts about 500 mostly Arab websites, including Al Jazeera, the Arab worlds most popular news channel. [GUARDIAN, 9/10/2001; WEB HOST INDUSTRY REVIEW, 9/10/2001] Three days after the initial raid, the task force is still busy inside the building, reportedly copying every hard disc they could find. It is not clear how long these websites remain shut down. [GUARDIAN, 9/10/2001] InfoCom began to be seriously investigated by the FBI in late 1998 when the name of an employee was discovered in the address book of bin Ladens former personal secretary. There also was evidence of a financial link between InfoCom and a top Hamas leader (see October 1994-2001). InfoCom is closely connected to the Holy Land Foundation. Not only are the two organizations across the road from each other in Richardson, Texas, a number of employees work at both organizations. For instance, Ghassan Elashi is both the vice president of InfoCom and chairman of Holy Land. [GUARDIAN, 9/10/2001; NEW YORK TIMES, 12/20/2002] A local bank closes Holy Lands checking accounts totaling about $13 million around the same time as the raid on InfoCom, but Holy Lands assets are not officially frozen by the government. [DALLAS BUSINESS JOURNAL, 9/7/2001] The US will shut down Holy Land and freeze their assets two months later (see December 4, 2001) for suspected ties to Hamas. Holy Land is represented by Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer   Feld, a Washington, D.C., law firm with unusually close ties to the Bush White House. [WASHINGTON POST, 12/17/2001] 




 Millions of Americans watch crime dramas and reality crime shows every night...but ask questions about the biggest crime in American history and youre a Conspiracist...

+ Never mind the fact that the government shipped the evidence to China and India to be recycled ASAP (isnt that what criminals do--destroy evidence?)...

+ Never mind that experienced pilots say they couldnt have flown a 757 or 767 into the WTC at the speeds the FAA tells us the planes were flying at...

+ Never mind that, within 10 days, the government was looking to pay off the victims relatives and forcing them to sign confidentiality agreements in order to receive money from the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund...

+ Never mind that there are over a dozen firefighters who will tell you they heard multiple explosions at the WTC...

+ Never mind that Dick Cheney asked Sen. Tom Daschle NOT to investigate 9/11 on several occasions. (Sen. Daschle was on the Joint Intelligence Inquiry into 9/11).

+ Never mind the fact that GW Bush wouldnt testify to the 9/11 Commission UNDER OATH and BEFORE THE PUBLIC (hes just the President--what did you expect?)...

+ Never mind that the 9/11 Commission Co-Chairmen wrote an editorial in the *New York Times* claiming the investigation was obstructed by the CIA and the White House.

 Imagine being shackled, your head is covered with thick black plastic so you cant see, you are then transported like cattle to another country, placed in a small room (or even a box) in which strange, intense loud music was played, the temperature may be drastically changed--if youre lucky they take you out for an hour per day, but maybe they leave you in there for 48 hours...After a certain period you begin to lose track of time as your senses shut down and your brain malfunctions into a state of shock. Maybe they feed you with enormously oversalted food and give you 1/2 glass of water. This is all legal because they havent caused your body physical harm!!!

Obviously, Im not saying that every prisoner at Guantanamo was treated this severely--but all of them were transported in shackles, with blacked out goggles on and most likely endured sleep deprivation, loud noises and other degradations...Prolonged exposure to these methods often cause severe mental trauma (sometimes in 48 hours).

The book [*A Question of Torture: CIA Interrogation, from the Cold War to the War on Terror*](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0805082484/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_dp_ss_3?pf_rd_p=1944687542 pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1 pf_rd_t=201 pf_rd_i=0299234142 pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER pf_rd_r=1EVRY4N9N3Z7RFCJR2YD) (by Alfred W. McCoy, 2006) goes much further into the issue, beginning with research the CIA funded in the 50s--much of it conducted in U.S. universities and hospitals. The doctors even published their research in medical journals afterwords.
At one point in the 1960s, the CIA made their rookies be subjected to these methods and a large portion of them couldnt finish the treatment (I think it was a week long).

What most people dont understand is that the U.S. military trained Iraqi police/militia forces in torture methods after the U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003. [The guardian made a documentary](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/06/pentagon-iraqi-torture-centres-link) last year centered around a U.S. officer named James Steele and his direct ties to Donald Rumsfeld. One has to question if teaching torture methods to Iraqis helped fuel the extremely horrifying headlines we saw from Iraq about large numbers of bodies being found beheaded. Most likely this was a back-and-forth, but I think that training, funding and feeding this type of torture program likely has much to do with the growth of ISIS and their brutal methods. The U.S. didn't just commit torture--the U.S. outsourced torture which may have helped feed the extremely vicious cycle of bloodbath after bloodbath. 




 Mark Mazzettis book *The Way of the Knife* covers quite a bit of Afghanistan/Pakistan--not sure if it specifically covers kidnapping/renditions. You can find a free pdf of the book at [r/TSBD](http://np.reddit.com/r/TSBD/) (Texas School Book Depository)--its #7...from index:

theres also a book *Monarch: The New Phoenix Program* which mostly covers Vietnam era operations--what happened in Afghanistan may have had its roots in the operations from the 60s and Central America in the 80s...heres a free pdf of the book by Philip Marshall: https://archive.org/stream/MonarchTheNewPhoenixProgram_441/Monarch#page/n1/mode/2up

Philip Marshall also did a book about Iran-Contra with Peter Dale Scott which is posted at r/TSBD (its #10)


Other authors to do keyword searches on would be Jeremy Scahill and William Blum + kidnapping + Iraq/Afghanistan + JSOC... (etc)

also try searching on wikileaks--they released tons of info on Guantanamo, Iraq, Afghanistan (most of which wont pop up on fucking google) 




 Im just starting to read one of Alfred McCoys books which begins with a brief history of the CIA research programs of the 1950s--scary fucking shit these CIA-funded doctors did with their research. Worst of all is the way the CIA attorneys squirm out of human rights agreements and then go on to bend and twist the meanings of words so the methods used arent considered torture. 

Imagine being shackled, your head is covered with thick black plastic so you cant see, you are then transported like cattle to another country, placed in a black cell (or even a box) in which strange, intense loud music was played--if youre lucky they take you out for an hour per day, but maybe they leave you in there for 48 hours...After a certain period you begin to lose track of time as your senses shut down and your brain malfunctions into a state of shock.

 thanks...looks like there are quite a few good candidates 




 I dont know why Roger Stone gets downvoted into oblivion...the last article I saw he said that the CIA considered whacking Nixon on 2 different occassions--which would actually gel with many others (such as Russ Baker) who theorize that Watergate was just a CIA operation designed to take Nixon out of office. Wish Russ and Roger would chat for an hour or two and post on youtube!!! 




 Thanks--glad you liked r/TSBD--its pretty much set up as a reference tool. 

I would definitely look forward to trying to get some authors, activists and/or documentary film makers for AMAs...r/conspiracy has grown from 75K to over 260K in the year and a half since I joined reddit. I think an achievable goal should be to have at least 2 AMAs every month by January.  




 Id love it if GG and JR chatted once a month...wish GG would start a once a week interview show (it must be nice for him to not be attacked) 









 Yes, its scary what the U.S. has done to Mexico, Central and South America while fighting the fake War on Drugs. I have also come to realize that the U.S. media has negatively effected my perception of people from the Middle East. As a child the media coverage of the Iran Hostage crisis greatly impacted my views about Iranians. Its only been more recently that I have been able to understand that the hostage crisis was actually blowback from the CIA 1953 coup detat in Iran. Not sure when the CIA files actually began to come out--but Im pretty sure that was never mentioned on *Nightline* (which began airing to give late night coverage of the hostage crisis). 

I guess the movie about Gary Webb is experiencing turbulence--I saw an online petition to pressure the studio (either they have shelved it or are cutting out parts). Even though its just a movie, I hope it gets released...I read in James Risens book *State of War* that NSA director Hayden actually watched *Enemy of the State* (with Will Smith)...(for some reason cryptome took the first page of chapter 2 out) http://cryptome.org/nsa-program.htm 



















 

the editor of consortium news worked for the AP and helped expose Iran-Contra...

As one of the reporters who helped expose the Iran-Contra scandal for the Associated Press in the mid-1980s, I was distressed by the silliness and propaganda that had come to pervade American journalism. I feared, too, that the decline of the U.S. press corps foreshadowed disasters that would come when journalists failed to alert the public about impending dangers.

Also by 1995, documents were emerging that put the history of the 1980s in a new  and more troubling  light. Yet, there were fewer and fewer media outlets interested in that history.

E. Snowden: I take the threat of terrorism seriously, and I think we all do. And I think its really disingenuous for the government to invoke and sort of scandalize our memories, to sort of exploit the national trauma that we all suffered together and worked so hard to come through to justify programs that have never been shown to keep us safe, but cost us liberties and freedoms that we dont need to give up and our Constitution says we should not give up.

B. Williams: But you can see how it happened. Guys with box cutters spent $200 using our own aviation system to take down our own buildings and smash into the Pentagon and a field in Pennsylvania. What are we going to do? Its a non-traditional enemy  the expression is, an enemy we cant see. What are we going to do?

E. Snowden: You know, and this is a key question that the 9/11 Commission considered. And what they found, in the post-mortem, when they looked at all of the classified intelligence from all of the different intelligence agencies, they found that we had all of the information we needed as an intelligence community, as a classified sector, as the national defense of the United States to detect this plot. We actually had records of the phone calls from the United States and out. The CIA knew who these guys were. The problem was not that we werent collecting information, it wasnt that we didnt have enough dots, it wasnt that we didnt have a haystack, it was that we did not understand the haystack that we have.

The problem with mass surveillance is that were piling more hay on a haystack we already dont understand, and this is the haystack of the human lives of every American citizen in our country. If these programs arent keeping us safe, and theyre making us miss connections  vital connections  on information we already have, if were taking resources away from traditional methods of investigation, from law enforcement operations that we know work, if were missing things like the Boston Marathon bombings where all of these mass surveillance systems, every domestic dragnet in the world didnt reveal guys that the Russian intelligence service told us about by name, is that really the best way to protect our country? Or are we  are we trying to throw money at a magic solution thats actually not just costing us our safety, but our rights and our way of life?

Former NSA Officers Thomas Drake, William Binney (et al.) Accuse U.S. Government of 9/11 Cover Up

"The sadder reality, Mr. President, is that NSA itself had enough information to prevent 9/11, but chose to sit on it rather than share it with the FBI or CIA. We know; we were there. We were witness to the many bureaucratic indignities that made NSA at least as culpable for pre-9/11 failures as are other U.S. intelligence agencies...

...My first day on the job at NSA was 9/11. I was immediately charged as the lead NSA executive to find and deploy the best technology at NSA for the fight against terrorism....

...Thats where I found the pre- and post-9/11 intelligence from NSA monitoring of some of the hijackers as they planned the attacks of 9/11 had not been shared outside NSA. This includes critical pre-9/11 intelligence on al-Qaeda, even though it had been worked on by NSA analysts. I learned, for example, that in early 2001 NSA had produced a critical long-term analytic report unraveling the entire heart of al-Qaeda and associated movements. That report also was not disseminated outside of NSA.

Make no mistake. That data and the analytic report could have, should have prevented 9/11...

...In short, when confronted with the prospect of fessing up, NSA chose instead to obstruct the 9/11 congressional investigation, play dumb, and keep the truth buried, including the fact that it knew about all inbound and outbound calls to the safe house switchboard in Yemen. NSAs senior leaders took me off the task because they realized  belatedly, for some reason  that I would not take part in covering up the truth about how much NSA knew but did not share.

When the 9/11 Commission hearings began, Director Hayden chortled at executive staff meetings over the fact that the FBI and CIA were feeling the heat for not having prevented 9/11. This was particularly difficult for me to sit through, for I was aware that NSA had been able to cover up its own culpability by keeping investigators, committees, and commissions away from the truth.

 anyone got a telescope so I can get a better look at that gash??? 




 the CIA has been helping the Qataris, the Saudis, the Jordanians and the Turks to pump in cargo planes filled with weapons into Syria since 2012...came across this article from March, 2013--every once in a while a small dose of truth seems to leak out

http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/25/world/middleeast/arms-airlift-to-syrian-rebels-expands-with-cia-aid.html?pagewanted=all _r=0

furthermore, Liz Cheney (Dick Cheneys daughter) began funding opposition groups in Syria and Iran as far back as 2005

http://prospect.org/article/commissars-town 




 True--the CIA loves a pliable dictator willing to bend over--especially if there is oil involved...it often ends up being a big bloody mess. 

Im pretty sure the proposed Iran-Iraq-Syria pipeline is what has sparked the current Syrian situation...

 




 some think the U.S. was FIRST...

or...

 Not sure if I can ask this but...Why would reddit ban you?

Congrats--I see *SKYGATE* has 31,000+ views...has youtube ever taken it down? I have seen this happen to other films--they take it down to keep the number of times viewed LOW.

THANKS for speaking out and hope that it hasnt caused you trouble with your job/family. 




 Saw your film--thanks for the info...I hope more people take the time to watch it. It is pretty mind-boggling that the planes were exceeding the speed they are designed for and could still be driven with accuracy by amateurs.

Still uncertain who to believe about cellphones being able to make calls from 20,000-30,000 feet in 2001...Seems most likely the cellphones would be cut off in a short time frame or experience quite a bit of interference...What about the AirPhones on the planes? have you looked into it? 

also, I recently saw this 9/11 Commission memo which states that WH Deputy Chief of Staff Josh Bolten said that Dick Cheney ordered Flight 93 shot down. After Cheney confirmed the shoot down, he then called President Bush to let him know it was shot down on his (Cheneys) orders. (slide down to Page 4)

U.S. policy in Iraq, from 1990-2003, was about REGIME CHANGE.

Chemical weapons, biological weapons, nuclear weapons were all just used to strike FEAR into the U.S. taxpayers. The U.S. knew exactly what Saddam had because the CIA and Mi6 were pumping information from intelligence/satellite sources to the UN Weapons Inspectors.
