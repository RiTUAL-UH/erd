 If your a fan of It Follows I highly recommend you watch The Guest. It is a action/horror/thriller with a lot of the same vibes and similar music. I personally love It Follows because of the pool scene, the music, and the last shot which sticks with you
 
























 Tarantino making a sci-fi Space epic. Something that takes place in a huge universe yet at the end of the day focuses on the main characters and their dialogue. 
























 people would shit bricks if this ever happened.   One can dream 
























 Cars 2.................lol jk

I Recommend Fast 5. Its the best in the series by far ( in my opinion)
