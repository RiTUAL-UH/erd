 Meeting girls parents, normally this wouldn't frighten me but she's graduating and i'm going to be spending apparently a significant amount of time with them alone. (college, not highschool)
Its an outdoor graduation, and its gonna be about 85 degrees F.  So i'll be wearing dark slim chinos and either a jcrew popover, or ocbd.
narrowed it down to these 4 pairs. http://i.imgur.com/bzUNAPj.jpg 

Normally wear boots for work, so the rogue wingtips wont bother me in the heat if you think they would work well.

personally was leaning toward the left pair, but not sure if they aren't casual enough for the occasion.  Never really dealt with this graduating stuff.

 A tank that says mastermind shouldn't be labeled as a "mastermind tank" unless its a tank top made by mastermind.
change that. unless your targeting the legal knock-off grey area market demographic. 




 chukkas or desert boots maybe.  Normally I dont care for toms, but i think matched with that shirt something interesting could be made. 




 I mean top notch celebs always wore high fashion, but fashion itself evolves over time. Rappers normally wore hood shit, there was alot of evisu and red monkey jeans. 
Streetwear itself started in the mid-late 70's/ early 80's.  brands like stussy and 10deep were specifically geared towards surfers.
Groups like Pharell and the clipse were the main reasons street wear blew up, they started wearing bape, supreme, and pharell started bbc.
I don't remember much more than that, its about when I got into clothing. Pharell came out in dem bapes and i was like I DONT KNOW WHAT THOSE ARE BUT I WANT THEM. 




 there once was a time when streetwear wasn't mainstream.  These things go in waves. Give it 5 years and there will be something else. 




 you could also check out sites like gilt, myhabit, and jackthreads.  Depending on you're area find outlet stores, nordstrom rack, saks fifth off fifth, etc.
but yah a job is pretty key, and don't get discouraged.  The amount you make is never enough, same for most everybody. 




 that second link is proper sketchy 




 If you're in the north-east you could check out barneys new york, and the tannery in Boston.  There's probably more, but those i'm 100% of. 




 pinroll 




 "reputable tailors in your city"?  




 great idea for a thread, but maybe change the title. A little misleading. But yah hope this comes through. :D 




 thanks, yah im hoping they stretch a bit. not as much as my past experience with apc. but they are a tad bit tighter than i'd normally wear. 




 for retail price they are better than I expected, and for sub $100 they far exceed my expectations.  and thanks! might shorten em a little, but figured i'd give big ass cuffs a shot.  mixed opinions on reddit and in real life haha 




 sweet, i was a little worried. out of the box they are one of the roughest pairs ive had.  was expecting the twill to be much lighter. 




 meh, they are for the ALS association. best friends dad just got diagnosed with it. made a donation and figured i'd wear the bracelets.  Normally i'd agree, but yah. circumstances. 




 http://imgur.com/a/tzmh8#0
Told myself I'd never get a pair.  Always thought I was too old for n f, thought their label was too tacky, and they had way too many gimmicks.  Found the skinny guys on karmaloop for ~$70 and figured i might as well give em a shot, seeing as how my apcs were about ready to become retired.
Sorry for the grainy quality, decent camera was too far away, and ms paint cropping.. 




 Yes they do, But if you only wear them on the weekends then just don't wash them at all.  Not because your a denim head, but because you don't want them to fade.  Hang em up and spray febreze on them every sunday night. 




 The only way their customer service could be better is if they would ship their offices to Boston so I could visit. ;)
cant wait for my kickstarter UH's and launch slims as well :D 




 It looks like monster hunter 3, and only showed more than 4 people on screen in a brief clip at the very end.  
I am very excited if it happens, but something screams skeptical. 




 Selvedge certainly does have to do with longevity. the extra stitching goes throughout making the denim itself more dense and durable.  It just happens to also ensure the edge of the denim doesn't fray (finishing edge).
realistically if your levis have lasted years then I would expect apcs to be the same, it all depends on how hard you wear them. 




 I believe the originals should be shipping this month (end of last month), and other fabrics will be shipping over the next 2 months.  Personally awaiting the Super heavy's which are slated for may shipment. 




 like Athosicus said... pretty much just hurdles, and high jump. lol 









 indigo paint. fixem' right up... 




 "curvy", "friction from walking" lol... Try a denim skirt... not much friction there... 




 keys on belt loop, everything else in shirt pockets.  If you don't have shirt pockets, then make shirt pockets.  Oh and put your eraser in the backpack, don't need dem shirts be disappearing up infront da honnies. 




 30 isn't that old, and you can still pull off streetwear without looking weird.
Streetwear unlike most sects of fashion has a huge range, spanning from skater to hip-hop to high fashion esque.  Sure a 30 year old man might not want to wear a pink camo bape hoodie, and ballin ass evisu jeans.  That would look pretty weird.  
Essentially what i'm getting at is just toning down a little bit.  Maybe pick up some 501's or other straight leg jeans, somewhere between baggy and slim.  Personally i'm even a fan of krew chinos if you want to go with a slightly more mature look.
Rather than wearing hoodies every day you could try out some LRG or mishka button ups.  Even just pick up some plain 'ole crewnecks. 
Replacing a whole sneaker rotation I dont see as being a problem, depending on your line of work.  Most grown men wear sneakers now adays.  Plus buying lots of shoes can get expensive.  But if you have the cash maybe check out some clarks desert boots.  They are more "adult" than sneakers in general, yet still look very young and hip.

Sorry to drone on, but i'm 27 and went through the same thing a few months ago.  I wore strictly streetwear for 5+ years, and am trying to move in a more mature direction.  But you always can mix in a few street staples to make a look come through.
gluck mate 




 If streetwear is just a trend then its a long lived trend.... I mean Stussy, 10deep, and vans alone have been around for 25-30 years individually.  Sure in the last 5 years the "streetwear" market has grown substantially, and I see that slowing down.  Imo it has stood the test of time, and it will always have a place in the fashion industry. 




 ACK, was ~4:00 am before work. I done goofed. 









 yah dishonored was really good.  Its just strange that these developers are all like, "need a name".  "OH I KNOW, lets pick something silly that starts with a C!" 




 dead space 3 









 boots, and general wear should do the trick 




 Aston Grey Rockcastle's.  Got em at DSW, I'd try and get into a DSW and try em on if you're thinking about buying.  They run huge, I had to size down 1.5 




 thanks, I sized 1 down.  Tried on 2 sizes down, and was really paranoid about crotch blow before they got a chance to stretch.  They are a little too big on my waist now, so i just wear an undershirt and tuck it in + belt.

Im on the same boat. Thinking of trying japan blue, or 3sixteen.  They seem to be the most comparable in value/quality.  Also hanging in to see if Gustin releases info on their 18.4oz selvedge indigo they talked about on here.  Although i'm not in a huge rush, still loving my apc's.  




 not sure exactly to be honest.  I spill chemicals on them at work from time to time, along with general wear and tear. 




 I washed them once, and I work in a factory where I wear them daily. Im guessing thats why I have significant wear around my thighs. 




 yea, essentially taking the sides in.  Giving the body a more flattering look.
Although even that might be tricky considering the pocket placement is really close to the side seam.  But i'm no tailor so it could be a non-issue. 




 be wary of breaking them in then deciding you want them hemmed.  Im guessing you meant try them on, and make up your mind. You just dont wanna start getting fades then make the fades look unnatural by hemming. 




 it was an in the moment type picture
http://imgur.com/a/wiwvn 









 not an expert, but the shoulders and arm holes look too big.  Probably not worth tailoring costs.  You could get it tapered, and maybe try it with a casual look. 




 Good lookin out, but yahh. Boston to SF is a long ways to go for a shirt. :(  Although I could deal with not being in -3 degree weather right now. haha 




 thanks for the quick response. Ya i'm pretty skinny. ~6'/150lbs, So I will probably hold out.  My local shops havn't gotten them in yet, i'm hoping they do eventually. 




 Mainly has anyone tried the fit. I need slim shirts, and they don't seem to make it in slim.
elbow honeycombs would be killer I think. 









 planetside 2... 




 give it 15-40 wears, they will size up to about a ~36.  From the waist to the bottom of your knees will stretch substantially.  So don't fret if they feel too tight.  If you like the tight look maybe check out the ns petit slims.  Can't say much for rescues, never owned a pair.
Also be careful until they do stretch.  Dont wanna blow the crotch out on a fresh pair. 




 scr8 up out da han dynasty? L Bu'in it an all dat? Teachin dem numbers? word. 




 the type on back is done beautifully. stencil, and spray? or by hand/ruler? Either way I love it. 




 my thoughts exactly. 









 I am and have always been primarily a PC gamer, and I love steam for what it is.  I just want to get other peoples opinions on what the big deal is with steam box/big picture mode.
I've had a living-room computer since the x800AIW card, which at the time was a really niche market.  But seriously. Most budget computers have hdmi out, and will be able to run more games and at a better quality than the "steambox".  Atleast with the given specs as of now, not to mention at a fraction of the cost.
A computer with HDMI out will also let you run your choice of OS whilst regular old steam at the same time.  The big picture mode web browser seems really clunky. The library section is also horrible when you have a descent sized game collection.
The lan party aspect of the steam box is intriguing, but in the same light for ~$1000 you could get a solid m-atx gaming rig with a lan case.  It wouldnt be as small, but atleast it could run AAA games decently.  Plus the steam box is marketed as a console killer, hence nix lan parties unless you are replacing your big computer with a small computer an a big TV.
Not trying to be a hater, just genuinely interested in other peoples opinions. 




 I foresee a horrible ending.. .

 Dark Souls pre-purchase.  I work hard for the money I use to buy games.  Therefore I buy games I deem very worthy of my money.  I feel dark souls would be worth my money, although with speculation of it being a crumby port job I'm not sure if I can swing it with my budget.
Im not sure if you can gift pre-purchases, either way I appreciate what you're doing. Great morale boost for the community as a whole :D 




 :D Yah I stumbled across it there when I was looking for the same case myself.  Great case, great price, and ncix has great service/fast shipping.  Hope you enjoy
PS Depending on what aftermarket cooler you go with make sure you check the depth specs. my Cooler master 212 evo has about a quarter/eighth inch of clearance from the case side.

 From what I understand they do stay forever.  Although individual server admins have the power to wipe their servers at any given point.  Essentially clear the world and start fresh.  Mainly wipes happen if the world gets over encumbered by tents/barbed wire/sandbags/etc, and or hacks.  So there isn't exactly periodic flashes, and technically given really bad luck your tent could be wiped the next day.  




 right on, didn't mean to cause a stir.  Thanks for clearing that up. 




 .. Ys origin's normal price is 11.99, not 19.99.  Flash deal price should be like ~5..  Bare in mind I just woke up and could be not thinking straight.

 I thought both the new consoles were supposed to be able to output at 4k.  how about we just wait and see about the framerate. not to mention 4k tvs/monitors  probably won't be in the average consumers houses for another 4-5 years anyhow.

 and if we're talking about the far off ps5 future I'm sure tech will evolve so as to create solutions keeping costs about at standard price. last gen was a much bigger advancement making the jump from 4:3  to 16:9  imo. 




 Every GTA game has come out on PC eventually, why is everyone so down like this one wont.

I'm not saying it will be soon, but it will likely happen eventually. 




  my computer has also been hooked up to my tv for 8 years or so. so I guess I might not be the target demographic. 




  most of the games I pay are in the steam eco-system. but not all of them, that sort of worries me. 




 If you're trying to get in shape, and new to denim I would absolutely go sub 200. Probably even cheaper.
A. make sure you actually like wearing raw denim.
B. It would suck spending a considerable amount of money on denim then losing weight.  Personally I would wait until you are happy with your weight and arent going to fluctuate much before spending big money. 




  buying multiple pairs of sub $200 denim rather than one pair of higher quality denim 




  rogue didn't cost 270 million dollars to make. 




 dreamcast  had a killer lineup.  jet grind, sonic 3d, shenmue, alot of other weird obscure imports. not to mention you can burn games on cds without modding  if your info that.
 the rest I'm impartial to, they are all good bets, but Saturn games might be a tad on the pricey side, if that matters to you. 




 2 out of 5 are free.  the rest combined are probably cheaper than this pack costs. 




 Somewhat interested in picking up a ps3. What are you looking for before I bother you for pics 




 My thoughts exactly. 




 Looks like they are working on it though. 

"The game isn't running on my Windows 8 machine. What do I do?We're sorry to say that Rogue Legacy is not officially supported by Windows 8. Some people have successfully managed to get the game running in that OS, but we can't provide support for those versions. We will be releasing an official version for Windows 8 along with the Mac and Linux versions." 




 Rogue legacy doesn't support win8. Maybe you could try running in xp compatibility mode. But not sure if there's any way. 




 Do you have windows8? 




 Trying something radically different than my usual slim fitting work wear. 









 normally don't care for pocket stitching, but those are absolutely beautiful.  Love the details.  Would love a fit pic when you get a chance! 




 not to mention, no matter how fast your network is you would have more latency streaming it to your pc than plugging your console into a monitor.

 shin megami tensei IV, Animal Crossing, Monster hunter III/IV.

 Not to mention OCBD's might not work depending on what he does for a living.
absolutely plain tee's, maybe try out a colored denim chambray. (personally think its a bit more casual than an ocbd) 




 If you want the 5 panel style, but don't need the brand behind it check out the ASOS brand. They are around $20, I haven't had any experience with them but for that price i recon its worth a gamble.
http://us.asos.com/search/5-panel?hrd=1 q=5+panel
 




 they've been 35-50ish for years.  roughly the same price as a 5950 authentic fitted cap.
the price will vary dependent on brand, and no they probably arent worth 25% of the construction/material price.  How would a company, particularly small brands make money if they were closer in actual vs retail pricing.

 I'm not looking for a single $1000 item, I'm looking to go shopping in Paris with $1000 for clothes which I believe is fairly frugal.
I thought quite a bit on where to post it, and took a shot. But im guessing in /r/expensivemalefashion they would tell me i'm being unrealistic and frugal. 




 because I'm not asking how to dress myself properly,  I'm asking for places to shop at under a budget. Perhaps local insight, if there are any French users. 




 Anywhere I should check out, looking to get a few interesting key pieces.  I know I could easily spend way more than $1000 on clothes in Paris, and am looking to make it stretch as much as possible.
Normally I'd consider myself to dress in the grey area between street wear and high fashion.  APC's/naked and famouse/Jcrew/and all sorts of different boots.
Also am specifically looking for things that would be hard to come by in the US.  I'm in Boston, so average high fashion is readily available (barneys, saks, neiman, riccardi)  Maybe some interesting mid-range french brands. The best example I can think of would be Supreme NYC, not that I would normally wear supreme but when im in NYC I go there because its such a hassle to get supreme outside of nyc.
Sorry to ramble on, and thanks in advance.

 thanks for the input guys, and yes the left pair is navy blue.  




 I wore the same pair of apc's to work atleast 4 days a week for about a year.  The only reason I stopped was because they developed some noticeable holes, and I didnt want people to ask why I never changed my pants.
Granted I work in a factory, so im guessing this is much more acceptable than day to day office wear. 




 "There are always the people who get a coat and they just look like pedo's."
priceless. 




 personally i'd go with a 5 panel cap if your gonna go with a cap at all.  Granted I guess it depends on your style.
HUF, Stussy, if your on a budget asos. 
























 Probably a Tucker Blair belt, but i cant find that specific model though.

 Maybe new in box, the name zelda sells units.the more units sold means the less valuable it will be in the long run.

 If you go up to NH at all you could check out myriad games and double midnight comics.both great gaming spots about 45 mins north of boston

 I dunno about raws. "Here's a pair of really expensive denim." "Wtf they are stiff, uncomfortable, and I want to wash them." "Naw man it's cool just wear them for the next three months...trust me".

I mean I love me some raw denim,I just don't think they are great for someone who doesn't care.  Personally I'd say a pair off dark washed denim,jcrew or something of the sort. 




 Nintendo needs to give up the virtual skoal. 




 Yea they opened a store in boston recently too, dropped in today and the sale was pretty great.seemed it was 50-75% off everything except a small section of next seasons line.

Pretty sure it's gonna be my new between season go to spot! 




 Yea my thoughts exactly, I wouldn't hold my breath. but it would be a great surprise. 









 sports cap and normal attire.  if its really cold i'll wear a sports beanie and normal attire. 




 faux fur isn't "pretty much the same thing" as coyote fur. 




 is that good at factory.jcrew as well? probably your best bet. :D Super cute though! 




 Solid chinos, and they sometimes drop around that price between seasons.

 




 [gap GQ collaboration](http://www.gap.com/products/gap-gq.jsp)  has alot of solid pieces, really depends what your looking for.  Some of those Baldwin denim pieces look really nice though. 




 If you have a couple extra bucks, these would be a solid pick-up for sure.

 I've always looked at fashion boards as an extended group of friends.  If you are around a certain group long enough you begin to act, dress, and like the things the group as a whole likes.  Every board had their select few individualists, sometimes they are the creative's, or industry people, or even just the ones with the most money and they tend to spark trends in the community.the only way to get "beyond"the group is to leave that specific group.
I'm a hypebeast person from 06, when I joined wdywt consisted of evisu, and red monkey jeans, bape hoodies, and dunks.  User/blogger Neek was the first to start posting fits of 501stf,wtaps/cukkas, and solid colored tshirts.  at first it wasn't well regarded "too sufu" a month later and it was the biggest entire forum paradigm shift I ever remember seeing.
 




 idk. god of carts..  or cart of war. 




 It's a fitted hat for the winter, it can be bought at lids in the winter... 




 that possibly herringbone fishtail parka is real tight.

and this whole fit is something special. http://fuckingyoung.es/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/CIVILIZED_fw14_lookbook_fy4.jpg

 War of the roses, if you don't mind only multi player.the sword pay is super rewarding 




 build a cheap pc, get 4 wireless 360 controllers and do the steam streaming thing.  All the couch co-op and cheap steam games you need.

Buy a ps4 if and when there are exclusives you want to play. 




 solid jeans,I love mine.They're really soft.although I ripped a belt loop off of mine last week...in Montreal.thanks for the giveaway, and someone enjoy! 




 game, depending on what time/where.  Maybe we could have it in Copley square, and if it rains we could move into the prudential food court or something.
Seems easily accessible for someone unfamiliar with the city, and not in the middle of the commons if it starts raining.

I can say they fit similar, we have very similar bodies, and I happen to be a person that has worn many different brands of T-shirts.  Sorry I don't own white T-shirts so a black one will have to do in this compare and contrast picture I have taken. 




 Gap tees fit very similarly, the necks aren't quite that large though. 




 Worked adequately on my 660ti. Wired pi, wireless ac300 pc.it's how I beat dmc, dark souls wasnt a great experience though.  My only problem was getting my 360 dongle to work with the pi, wound up just leaving the dongle on my pc.and bringing the controller to another room. 




 Yah I got the opacity mask working just fine.meant to work in rgb anyhow, habitually work in cmyk due to work.but thanks for the advice! 




 argh, thankyou... Forgot to work in rgb, clipping masks dont like cmyk gradients for some reason.  But ya Got it sorted out.

 I want to cut the circle out of the mesh, "minus from front/back"  




 I want to minus a circle from that mesh, am I out of luck?  









 I'm a graphic designer who currently works in print production.I've always wanted to get into ui/menu design.  Really,I just don't know where to start.do you know of any indie devs around the city who would be looking to give a guy a chance and get free work in return.either that or any indie designers who would want to take on an apprentice?  Thanks for all your work! 




 Sorry if this is a dumb question, anyhow.
My first credit card was a CapitalOne Platinum card, It was just about the only card I could get with very little credit history.  After a year or so my credit score is ~700, and I was pre-approved for the Cap quicksilver card.
If I have 2 cards in my wallet, one with a higher APR and no rewards and the other the opposite I don't see myself using the platinum card any more.  I don't want to close my platinum card, and lose all the history I built with it.  I also don't want to keep it unused and have that go against my credit score, as little as it may actually effect it.

I'm also planning on applying for the Discover it card, and don't really care to keep track of 3 credit cards.  I'm very responsible with credit, and 90% of the time I don't carry a balance from month to month unless I'm hit with a last minute emergency in which I clear it off as quickly as possible.  I'm just not the most organized person in the world, so the thought of carrying around 3 cards scares me.

Thanks in advance. 




 Getting more money for mk vs dcu than for bf3 it's bonkers, nobody could be looking for that game.

 I am planning on buying a condo in the next month, I will be taking a 30-year mortgage and am not sure whether to go with an adjustable or fixed rate.
I'm accounting for my finances with no over-time at work, and I will be fine making payments with either loan.  I'm planning on paying the loan back within 10 years.  For the moment going with an ARM would save me on monthly payments for when I am not getting over-time.  (its slow season now)  For 2/3rds of the year I am planning on making double/triple payments.
Would I be wise to stick with the best % fixed rate mortgage?

I have about enough finances saved up to pay it off in full if things get bad, but I would rather build more credit.  I also don't want to buy a cheap condo in full and have no just-in-case money left.

PS. thanks to everyone who helped me out in my rent vs buy topic from a couple days ago.   




 Dracut, lowell, haverhill. Depending what you consider around. 25-35 minutes away is close enough for me. I work out of Chelmsford ma. The cheapest I've found near the city proper is Malden, but the cheap cheap end was like 130k 




 Thanks a lot, I'm going to have to look into a buying agent and see what I come up with.  Glad to hear you made out well on your condo!! 




 Absolutely atleast 5 years.
The place I have my eye on currently, well one of many.  The one I'm waiting to hear back from has been on the market for about half a year, and has already lowered their price about 10k.  It isn't a very convenient area, it just happens to be very very convenient to the place I work.  I do need to have it seriously checked out though, if I get serious on this one.  Because that length of time tends to make me nervous.
Thanks for the advice! 




 Thanks a lot, I would have absolutely overlooked that. 




 I promised my mom I would before she moves to Florida, I'm staying in the Boston area.  The last thing I need is for her to be worrying about me, when she needs to be worrying about herself.
Figure there is no harm in meeting with the guy once and seeing how I feel.

 




 Thanks, I will have to look into that.
At the moment I'm looking for a one bedroom, in hopes that my girlfriend will move in when she is ready.  For now I want to prove i can be fully independent, and if she moves in we would be making about 100k in total together and could pay it of quick, and or live like king/queen.
I went into more detail why she can't at the moment a little further up, but ya after dealing with roomates for years I don't know if i can go back to it. 




 Thanks, average in my area is only about $150.  A few im looking at are around $250 with gas heat included.  When I was renting, during the winter my gas bills were around $250 alone.  So at that price it seems to even out. 




 Me and my girlfriend are pretty serious, but at the moment I need to do whats best for me.  Since moving back home I have an hour commute to her, and a 45 minute commute to work.  The places I am looking to live would be within 25 minutes from her, and 10-odd minutes to work. ~200 a month in gas in my civic is getting old.
She doesn't have a car, She moved to the states when she was 16 and has had Boston public transportation ever since.  Wherever I look at I anticipate bringing her, and value her opinion.  But for the moment I want to prove that I can be completely independent by myself, and hopefully she will move in with me eventually.  I can't afford to live walking distance from the subway by myself, and need to be safe if anything happens between us.
Just to clarify, she makes more money than me.  She doesn't drive because she never needed to drive, but she's working on it. (I don't want anyone thinking poorly of my lady ;))
 




 I don't want land, I grew up in suburban NH and have plenty of land.  I hated every minute of any yard work, and shoveling I've ever had to do.  I would love to get a townhouse maybe, but its out of my budget at this moment, and will likely be for the next 5-10 years. 




 Thanks for the input. I have 65k is saved up.so even after a dp I have some wiggle room.have an appointment next week with a financial advisor.is there anything you would recommend asking or telling an advisor? 




 I'm 28 years old and was renting for a few years.  My father passed away last year and I moved back in with my mother. (not trolling for sympathy, just giving context).
My childhood house is going on the market, and I need to come up with something to do soon/within the next few months.  Condo's in my area are in the 75-100k range, and I have enough money saved where I could comfortably put in a 30% dp.  If anything goes completely awry I have enough saved where I could probably buy it outright.  
I make about 40k, and am happy at my job and don't intend on leaving it or my area any time soon.  It also works out with the loan I'd be taking plus average hoa fees in my area that I could live in a nicer condo for cheaper than renting.

I strongly oppose going back to having roomates, and I don't want a house (after maintaining my current home over the past year).

edit: also I know this isn't the reality sub, but if anyhow knows about how firm condo prices are it would be appreciated.  I don't want to offer 65k on an 80k condo, planning to settle between 70-75 and have my offer seem like a slap in the face only to not hear back.  (I don't know if condo's are like houses, and owners expect an offer, or if they expect to get the asking price.)

Any opinions or advice would be greatly appreciated, hopefully y'all can help me from giving myself more headaches. 




 Crazy Titch 




 are you sure its your videochip? do you have windows 7/8 32 bit or 64 bit?  32 bit isn't supported and could lead to some of those same problems 




 Shoe goo works wonders 




 I'm sure there are more tv addicts out there than gamers, but thats old news. Gaming is still relatively newer, and still has weird stigmas attached to it. Personally gaming is more addicting to me because it is more engaging than those other things.

Edit: Also when you finish a show you are done, you have to wait for next week. Same with a book.  With mmo's and mobas, things that people are generally addicted to there is no end. You can keep playing forever with no real reason to stop 




 Strange, ya sometimes if things are too close to a Wi-Fi source they won't connect.maybe try using the cable and getting all the system updates, if you haven't tried that yet.if that doesn't work you might have to contact support.heh 




 Did you try moving the ps4 further away? 




 I agree, permanent.  If they aren't friends at first it wont take too long before they have some sort of chemistry. 









 Rakim ran shit 




 2, just because the blazer in the first picture looks crap. 




 might be good to include your price range. 




 you can program a game using the Commodore, you can't on the arari or the coleco.in the most basic sense I guess every console is technically a computer, but not really. 




 Search, then post... 




 The commodore was a computer, and no one ever took sides with the colecovision.

 




 I received an email stating that my account info was changed.  For some reason there is no button in the email to say no it wasn't.  All of my information was changed, so i can't retrieve my account.
I had no credit card info stored, and 10 dollars in my "wallet".  My library is all backed up.
Is it worth calling customer support? is there anything they can do? should i just bite the bullet and make a new account? 




 Madvillainy then mmmfood. 




 Jimmy boi is aiight 




 Rayman will last twice as long(if not more), and strider is half the price.  They are both great games, rayman is arguably better.  But i haven't had as much experience with strider.

essentially either way is a pretty good bet
 




 anyone else having this issue? Seems like it's trying to launch the full game. Giving me the error "you don't own the licensing"
baffled



Solved. If anyone else has this issue go to settings/psn/restore licenses 




 Absolutely not 




 tmtm 




 A lot less work than making 14k 




 people have been predicting these things every day for the last 10-odd years. lets take a break for the day. 




 Try soaking them more often.they will fade slower, but the denim will stay more healthy and less prone to crotch blowout. I almost never wear these because of all the holes, and am kicking myself for not soaking em more often.  




 Atleast you don't have to worry about indigo bleed ruining your shoes. 




 I started off with Venomancer, was pretty good too me. Lots of aoe and dots, can hold down a lane pretty well
 




 raw denims been becoming mainstream for a long time.  Similar to how street wear used to be exclusive to small boutiques, and now its available at zumies.


5 years ago you saw Raw denim at high-end stores/some boutiques, now you can get it at urban outfitters and macy's.

Not that there's anything wrong with that.

The niche market likes it, the famous people start wearing it, the rest of the world wants it. It is what it is 




 APC NS, roughly 1.5 years. 1 soak 1 wash.

 ack, thanks for the info. 




 Just last week I upgraded my service to a triple play deal, because it worked out to be cheaper than my current tv and internet separate bill.  along with upgrading my internet from performance (25MBps) to 50*.
Today I go outside and find a box from comcast, inside was a technicolor TC8305C MONSTROSITY.  I called comcast to say I did not want it, only to find out I had a tech coming to my house in 2 days, I had no idea about this.
Currently I have a asus RT-AC68R, and a Motorola SB6121.  Am I going to need this outrageous technicolor box to add digital voice to my package?  Or is there an inline solution they can do.  I dont want another 2.4GHz device mucking up my signal (I have a pretty large house, and have a few devices stuck on 2.4 still)
Is my best bet to pay comcast for a phone line that I don't use, and continue paying AT T for my phone service? 




 February is probably a safe bet 




 True, the other day I got my jcrew selvedge chambray stuck between some pressing rollers at work.rather than being smart and turning off my machine I instinctively ripped my shirt out. I lost a button, and was amazed it didn't get torn at the stitching.if their quality starts to diminish I'll just have to go elsewhere. 




 In the summer, sometimes.also depending on the cut of my pants.

I have a 197X austro daimler AD S, which im trying to convert as cheaply as possible, hence why i'm looking at retrospec.
Just getting back into cycling, and don't want to drop a lot in case its just a passing phase.
Also if anyone has recommendations on quality budget cranksets/wheels I would love to hear. (as quality as budget can be)
