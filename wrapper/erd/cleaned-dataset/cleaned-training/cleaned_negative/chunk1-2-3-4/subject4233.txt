 Joseph Ferdinand Gould (12 September 1889  18 August 1957)[1] was an American eccentric, also known as Professor Seagull. Often homeless, he pretended to be the author of the longest book ever written, an Oral History of the Contemporary World (or Oral History of Our Time). He inspired the book Joe Gould's Secret (1965) and its film adaptation (2000), as well as being a character in the 2009 computer game The Blackwell Convergence.

Interesting read.

 The good thing is for some reason I have probably 6 seasons of the show to catch up on. 
























 Drink beer and eat takeaway and watch DC movies. We are too old to be doing that but fuck you. 




 Probably couldn't get a Taxi
