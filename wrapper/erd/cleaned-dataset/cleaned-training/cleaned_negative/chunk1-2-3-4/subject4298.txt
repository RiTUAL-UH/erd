 YOU FUCKED MY CAT TOOOO!?!?!?

dude, I'd get checked if I were you, that cat is a fucking whore 




 I've only known one person IRL who likes it, which is my brother.

I'm not gonna take the time to describe my brother in great detail, but he is the second dumbest person I know. He's also the furthest thing from a 'nerd' 




 Hey, I remember that, I was there too! 




 dude, I don't even know... I'm gonna go watch TV 




 How about DigiDesign? 




 I'd eat the butter whole and then when he eats ME, i'll kill him slowly with high cholesterol!  




 Other than it not being funny, most people who are smart enough to use the internet don't like the show, so there's *that* 




 I would give myself omnipotence. I'm getting sick and tired by my lack of omnipotence 




 meh.

It's ok

 Probably not the day I was born 




 Because they like it rough ;) 




 I'd tell you, but I don't wanna be an associate to a violent murder and/or kidnapping

 What are your strengths? 




 I'd probably be a politician 




 Which n word?

narwhal?

neverland?

*nostril?* 




 Plain and simple: They wanted enough time to pass before mentioning Jon (Arin's post explaining WHY they didn't mention him was not a lie, despite Jon disagreeing with it)

They didn't want people flipping their shit over Jontron mentions or fighting over wanting the show to be what it was and not what it is. They wanted the show to move forward and not live in the past. Meanwhile, plenty of people, Jon and Nicole included, loved to troll you guys HARD on this sub

Finally enough time had passed when they felt like nobody would flip out over breaking the vow of silence. Dan had been there way longer and they reached a point where one of his serials was the longest running one. A perfect time to drop the silence. And NOBODY flipped out over it except for Conspiracy Grumps (it kind of killed it, TBH) Sure, plenty of people were shocked, happy, and glad to see it, but they didn't have a nerdgasm.

I don't think it was ever a breakup thing or a lost friendship. I think one guy just simply moved too far away to be involved. When your partner abandons you, you don't focus on the past, you focus on the present and doing your best to make a good product, which they did. Part of that required not mentioning Jon so that people didn't grow to loathe Dan or even Arin because it wasn't the way it started (And this sub particularly grew to loathe Arin) And they made the right choice because the show got exponentially better when Dan joined

 It's not about what THEY want... it's a matter of us showing our dominance and degrading them. Kinda like dogs marking their territory.

Only we give them baby gravy instead of peeing on them (though there are some folks who are into that as well)

 I make comedic films, CG animations, VFX shorts, and even a few songs coming up.

All of that primarily parodies video games, like my first song here;

 care to provide an example, as OP asked? 




 Arin cheated on him with Dan, so Jon ran away to NYC to become a model... I think he became quite successful:

 He does, but a lot of it might be fueled by the shitty part of this fanbase.

He's definitely the funniest though, hands down 




 All of them 




 I was right though. I doubted it was an alternate title 




 This one time my brother's digestive system wasn't working right and he shat out undigested spaghetti and sauce. I know this sounds fake but it's completely real. We were camping, he took a dump in the woods, then called us over to show it to us (it had little bits of digested fecal matter, but mostly looked like a dropped plate of pasta) My dad took him to the doctor the next day, I don't remember anything past that and it never happened again. 




 While they kinda feel like the same game at times, Majora's Mask for me. But only barely, primarily due to the creepiness of it and I never played it as much as I played OoT when I was a kid, yet I still remember it being more fun.

But OoT is a better icon in video-gaming and is the best representation of a perfect Zelda game 




 Not at all. Just a mediocre video made by Rocketjump. 




 funny stuff, man! 




 Fire. Literally fire everywhere, as far as the eye can see.

At least that's what FoxNews tells me 




 I'm saying that there is no original you. There are all these universes happening at the same time, without the presence of the others. They don't pop in and out of existence, they merely change when things happen in them. Sometimes those things don't happen in the others and over time the two will not be similar at all.

Even in other, similar universes, the person that looks, acts, and thinks like you isn't you. He doesn't share your atoms, your conscience, or your universe. He is a different person entirely

 like this:

ooxlxoo! 




 Well, what I mean isn't that the other universes are created when possibilities are presented, it's that those moments are where each universe starts to veer into its own, beginning with the most miniscule of differences. There wouldn't be an original 'you' just a different one.

A question I just thought of, though...

In an infinite universe, where mathematically speaking, anything that is possible or thinkable can and will eventually happen, then wouldn't THAT be in a way, predestination/fate? 




 That guy that did the thing. It mattered 




 and I'll make **this sound:**

 Posting this because my second daughter was born today and I immediately thought to myself "this is no time to make jokes.... save them for reddit :)  












































 God, what goes through someone's fucking mind when they see a video and decide to negatively comment on it without even watching it?

"I skipped around through it and the 45 seconds I watched were fucking terrible." 

Translation: "Didn't watch - Still Criticized!" 

Seriously, go fuck yourself if you're this type of person! People work hard on videos and your comment isn't wanted or needed! 









 I used to do stand-up but stopped doing it to pursue filmmaking/improvised comedy. Recently, some new opportunities have arisen that may require me to do some stand-up on the side. I wanna talk about subjects that actually interest me, and definitely subjects that haven't been done to death. I've written some jokes on Star Trek, a few on being married that send up the "married life cliches" in stand-up and sitcoms, and a few on death that lead into the concept of Hell. I'm most proud of the last ones because, not only do I think they are the funniest bits, but it's a very interesting subject that I don't think I've heard many comedians talk about. The only thing that comes to mind is George Carlin's "but he LOVES you" bit.

So, I'm wondering, what are some topics you, as an atheist, would love to hear some comedy about? You know, there's SO many things that comedians could touch on but they don't, I just want to know what the community itself wants. 

edit: For reference; here are some examples of the Hell material: "... I mean, you never see a father trying to discipline his kid going "HEY! BILLY! Quit hitting your sister with the stick or I swear to Christ I will punch you in the fucking face! And I'm not JUST gonna punch you.... I'm gonna punch you...... FOREVER!!!

Also, "The belief in Hell clearly stems from these peoples' history of being abused as children as well as living in a society that recommends and accepts it. It implants warped views of justice in their minds and gives them a sense of an unavoidable cosmic malevolence.... trust me, I googled it..." 

















































 My daughter is two years old and I've been thinking a lot about when the time comes when somebody in our family tries to push religion on her. It'll definitely happen and it'll likely start with something they'll see as "small and harmless" like the concept of heaven. I'm trying to prepare my way of explaining it to her when she asks me about it, tell me if this sounds good:

"Well, a lot of people believe that when we die, we go to a special place called Heaven. Grandma, Grandpa and a few people we know believe this, but they don't know for sure. NOBODY knows for sure if it's real or not or even what it's like. We DO know that when we die, some people have these very realistic dreams and sometimes people go to heaven in these dreams where they'll be happy. Sometimes they see old friends or family members who made them happy. Sometimes they go to their favorite place in the world that made them happy in life. I think this is why people want heaven to be real, they want to be happy. But it's far more important to be happy here and now, while you can. Dying is a natural part of life... we're given a short time on this earth to experience happiness, sadness, anger, delicious food, fun, responsibility, and to do or create something important that makes everyone else's lives better. As for what happens when that time is over... NOBODY knows, even if they tell you they do. NOONE knows because noone's ever lived to tell about it.

 That's the only reason I could think of that anyone would wish they could change their sexuality.

But what they really mean is, they wish that people didn't hate others so aggressively for something that doesn't affect *their* lives at all.

She seems really competitive when she's playing a video-game.

 If you've ever been in a live-action video, you'd probably understand what an uncomfortable experience it is. You have these bright lights on you, a camera pointing at you, a microphone dangling over your position, people behind the camera watching, and an audience in the future will be viewing your every move expecting to be entertained. The main thing that defines good acting is the ability to put that awkward situation past you and be entertaining or funny or portray a character with emotions.

Ross has a great technique of playing his uncomfortable awkwardness for laughs. Ross's mannerisms in the live-action videos are a character unto themselves. He's often at his funniest in those videos

 I get what you're trying to say, but a remix is just something that uses the actual work but adds or changes it a little. For a parody, you would have to reproduce the music (thus, the imitation) AND change the lyrics. Neither that nor a parody are abstract concepts, they're pretty clear.

But remixes can be protected under fair use as well, as long as they meet certain government standards, unfortunately, one of the requirements is that it can't be done for profit without permission 




 No they cannot! That is the goddamn point! You can't sing small portions OR large portions! I'm not spamming, people like you just keep refusing to do any research! Fair use is clearly defined by law and that is not someone's opinion!

If you need different links, I can provide you with some, none of which you can't find yourself on google, but I assure you that they will all say the same thing. Here's one that debunks that weird '30 second rule' that people throw around. (one you probably believe, which is why you seem so adamant on your factually disproven position)

http://studentpressblogs.org/nspa/the-non-existent-30-second-rule/ 




 No, then they are **commenting** on the other target. Parody just means a piece of writing, music, etc., that imitates the style of someone or something else in an amusing way.

If they were 'parodies of the other target' then they would be imitating THAT target. Parody doesn't mean 'make fun of' even though it is usually a requirement to achieve effect.

I can reproduce the music and melody but change the words to, for example, "I'm Coming Undone" by Korn to "I'm cumming on Jon" and it would be considered a parody, even though I'm not commenting on the song itself. 

Not every parody has to be a Bart Baker video where you literally just trash the artist for the duration of their song 




 Why do you think they are protected legally? 

They aren't 'false claims.'

They performed songs on record without the rights. You can't do that, they can't do that, random people on youtube can't do that.

It is called INFRINGING! It is illegal and it puts their business in jeopardy!  

Take a moment to actually READ this, and I suggest you do the same for other topics before posting and perpetuating a misconception:

http://www.songrights.com/infringe.htm 




 For the same reason there are movies and other copyrighted works on youtube. Youtube can't police everything all the time when hours of content are uploaded every minute.

Just because people do it doesn't mean it's legal 




 In case you see this, Suzy:

We love you!

 




 Even if the videos aren't monetized, it's still illegal to perform a song without the rights 




 No. It's a legal thing. Maker is trying to cover the Grumps' seven asses against copyright infringement claims.


http://www.songrights.com/infringe.htm 




 Parodies don't have to be focused on the original work. It's perfectly okay to make fun of another target. 

Weird Al for example, I can't think of an instance other than that Nirvana song where his work commented on the original 




 It should end with a T-Shirt Commerical.

The shirt being advertised says "Gone Grumps" 




 True, the parody solution is the only viable one they have, even if they just change the last line. (They could re-upload those episodes with the singing parts edited to parody songs, or just censor them out)

I even posted this suggestion a few weeks back and a few morons decided to comment about how evil Maker is for taking the videos down (despite just protecting the channel by doing so) and that anyone can sing covers, yadayada. I deleted it because I didn't feel like debating with a bunch of stupid fucks. (Hardly a debate if it's fact vs opinion) I feel like too often on the subs I have to correct misconceptions a lot of people have over the business side of entertainment.

But man, everything I hear about Australia makes it sound so much better than America 




 People who hate Suzy and people who don't know how a business functions seem to be so adamant about this.

Everyone else either doesn't care or silently disagrees with the creepy fucks (and trust me, that 'everyone else' is exponentially higher than the vocal minority) 




 and hopefully the Grumps will unlock him and he'll be a special guest soon (and periodically in the future) 




 A couple of creepy fucks did a creepy fuck thing to try to prove that Suzy is Super-Hitler or something.

Over something that doesn't even involve Game Grumps.

Seriously, this fanbase... wow... 




 There is an actual legal problem, it's that singing songs you don't have the rights to is copyright infringement.

http://www.songrights.com/infringe.htm

A lot of people here have a misconception about this, thinking it's something covered under fair use, but that would only work if Game Grumps was a review show (and reviewing the song in question)

While youtube's automated "third-party content" detector does suck, they can repeal false claims. But if they get flagged with proof that they infringed on someone's song sitting right square in the middle of the video, it won't go over well for them.

I know it seems unfair and I know you see it everywhere on youtube, but it is illegal to perform cover songs without permission. (And, you'd be surprised to see how many covers have been flagged and now all the ad revenue goes toward the copyright holder) 




 no you cannot

http://www.songrights.com/infringe.htm

edit: Lol, I got downvoted for posting a fact. God, this sub is stupid 




 You can't sing songs for 10 seconds, 5 seconds, not even 2 seconds (if you can even fit it in that short of a time)

It's copyright infringement and that has the potential to get them flagged, which puts their business in jeopardy.

Just because you see people on youtube doing cover songs does NOT mean it's legal. You also see people post clips of movies they don't own. 

http://diymusician.cdbaby.com/2012/03/on-posting-cover-songs-on-youtube-music-licensing-law-explained/

edit: Lol, I got downvoted everywhere that I posted facts. God, this sub is stupid

 it wasn't the fanbase. It was the subreddit. The subreddit is full of shitty people.

The existence of ventgrumps and conspiracygrumps is proof of that 




 Yeah, but what if Jon lives in another city? Like, all the way across the country?

Man, that'd suck wouldn't it? 




 Suzy is the greatest goose in the gaggle of Grumps 




 She wasn't referring to the fanbase, just the subreddit.

And was she wrong?

Literally everything you said is inaccurate, except for saying that Game Grumps makes money from their videos. (not your fault though, people perpetuate these myths so much that it becomes one of those things accepted as "common knowledge" even though it's completely wrong) 




 You don't need to "see evidence" to understand how a multichannel network functions.

Maker has access to the channel, that doesn't mean they control it.

Multi-Channel Networks (MCNs) are entities that affiliate with multiple YouTube channels, often to offer assistance in areas such as product, programming, funding, cross-promotion, partner management, digital rights management, monetization/sales, and/or audience development"

They pulled the videos because those videos were infringing on copyright. If all of those videos got flagged at the same time, and Youtube accepted the claims, the channel would be shut down immediately, considering that it only takes three strikes.

Maker was not acting maliciously, they were protecting the Grumps, even if the Grumps think they should be able to sing random songs.

They still can sing songs as long as they change the words and make fun of them, therefore classifying it as a parody. They'll soon realize that and I'm sure they'll go back an re-edit those videos to include parody versions of the songs they are singing (or at least censor those parts) 




 Cover songs are NOT covered under fair use!

People HAVE been flagged for this before, it's just extremely rare because most record companies don't care about people just singing a song. (but why risk your business over this? Just don't sing songs)

But yes, it is copyright infringement, regardless if it's considered a cover.

http://www.songrights.com/infringe.htm 




 That doesn't make them in control of the Grumps. It just means they have access to the channel in case of situations like these 




 I just shat after an hour or two of constipation.

It was like the weight of the world being lifted off my shoulders

Or, more realistically, out of my anus 




 Best thing I've ever read on Conspiracy Grumps 




 That's the most common myth people believe, but the truth is, it's infringement regardless of the amount of time.


If you are doing a video that falls under fair use (a review, a critique) then using 30 seconds is protected. Game Grumps is not a review show.

And they would also have to PROVE fair use, it's not automatically assumed.  




 Ah, the classic "I say something therefore it is true and I will reiterate it as often as possible" technique. 
Like I've never seen that technique from a marijuana user.

Marijuana is not healthy. There is no reason it should be illegal, but it is definitely not healthy. It's not terrible, but neither is it healthy.

And science disagrees with what you say science says about weed:

 It wouldn't be via Maker, it would be between themselves (Maker does not control any of the channels that sign with it. Multichannel Networks function like talent agents.) And an NDA wouldn't prevent them from talking about Jon, just behind the scenes details.

Arin explained why they didn't talk about Jon, WAAAAAY long ago and there is nothing sinister behind it:

http://www.reddit.com/r/gamegrumps/comments/1j21po/thank_you_all/cbae3uj 

Once all that emotion died down it was okay to talk about him again 




 lol, no. It's not Maker's rules, Maker doesn't own Grumps. It's a simple business decision, don't do anything that might get your video flagged for copyright infringement.

And no, it isn't covered under fair use. You cannot sing or play a song that you do not have the rights to in a video that you are monetizing. Plain and simple.

Arin is smart enough to know that it's best not to risk getting his channel taken down over something as dumb as singing some song. 

Though, as long as they parody the song, changing the words/making fun of it, then they have free reign.


EDIT: Lol, why the hell was this downvoted? Because people "disagree?" I'm sorry folks, but that's the sad truth. That doesn't mean you downvote something. Do a small amount of research on copyright infringement, fair use, and the way MCN's function. 




 lol, okay 




 lol "unfortunately"

 People downvote factually accurate information on this sub quite often. I don't know why 




 10/10 




 Man, I wonder if he's ever shit himself and subsequently delayed a video for a decade 




 I didn't know about it until Arin said it. And this was one of my favorite games growing up 




 No, they'd just get the video removed or more likely, claim all of the revenue on the video. I think they'd only sue if the person kept re-uploading the video, fully aware of his/her copyright infringement.

But they'd have to send a cease-and-desist before they brought the person to court 




 It's possible that they were singing songs owned by Universal Music Publishing, which Maker signed a deal with them that allows their partners to use their library of music.

It's also possible that Maker just didn't see those videos where they were singing those songs 




 I don't know why they haven't yet. They're such big Disney fans, Arin has an awesome Keyblade as decoration, and the game is phenomenal!  




 We need to start a petition 




 Maybe for an hour-hour and a half one-off. I really loved the Endless Ocean videos, but those work well the way they did. I wouldn't want to see it as a series because it would last for the rest of my life (damn, imagine how much longer it'd be if they played as a stealthy character in Skyrim) 




 They need to play Pokemon Snap. It'd be a nice, short, but funny series. Lots of laughs to be had with throwing the apples and poison balls as Dan describes the horrific animal abuse Arin is inflicting upon these creatures 




 Well, this is a *fine pickle!* 




 I can make it. You just kinda flap your tongue between your lips really fast while breathing in slowly

Edit: I guess my statement required some downvotes for some reason 




 It tastes pretty good, actually 




 Mad Dog 20/20 




 Yes, in the contract, they do ask for access to your password (they kinda need it to view the ad revenue so they can determine their share of the profits.)

Something like this makes sense. Put a video on private so that no claims can be made against it until the Grumps resolve the issue by either censoring the singing or changing it to a parody of the original song.

Here's something I feel everyone who doesn't understand what a MCN like Maker is or does should read: (it covers all the basics)

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-channel_network 




 To protect the Grumps from legal action from the songs' owners.  Plain and simple. They may have had an insider tip that some people in the industry were litigiously searching for copyright infringements on youtube.

All it takes is three strikes and your channel is shut down permanently. Game Grumps has more than three videos that could be flagged for copyright infringement. And Youtube treats you as guilty until proven innocent.

Exchange of advice for money was *just an example* of the services that MCNs provide. For Game Grumps specifically, they find better brand deals and targeted advertising toward the demographic their audience is categorized as 




 You can't "display an entire work" if the work is interactive. One person's experience playing a game will be different than another's. Again, watching a video of gameplay is not the same as playing a game. 

The LP video is a separate product entirely.

Fair use is a defense for when someone is taken to court over an issue such as this. (Civil laws are also upheld in court, in case you didn't know)

Two of the things a court would use to determine if Fair Use applies are:
the nature of the copyrighted work (In LP cases: a platform for the real product, *Commentary* to be provided)
the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyright work. (This varies based on the game's quality, but it at least represents an honest portrayal, as opposed to game trailers or reviews)

Last, but certainly most important, **there is no absolute rules as to how much of a copyrighted work may be copied and still be considered a fair use.**  http://itlaw.wikia.com/wiki/Fair_use

 




 I didn't say they were parodying the game, they are providing commentary. Fair use protects parody AND commentary, two different things entirely. Distributing a video of them playing a game, with commentary, doesn't infringe copyright, because the game is not meant to be observed, but interacted with.

The legality of these videos hasn't been established because nobody's ever questioned it, but one day when someone brings a LPer to court (likely Nintendo) it will (hopefully) rule in this industry's favor, because they are not releasing the same product as the game company. Watching gameplay and playing a game are not the same thing.


My point is, it's in a grey area now, legally, but as long as it is a grey area, Nintendo is not entitled to that revenue. 




 I meant from a legal standpoint. If it's youtube we're talking, the biggest enemy is their policy of "you're guilty until proven innocent. And we won't listen to you when you try to prove your innocence" 




 The first one with Jon 




 Nintendo's been the biggest enemy since Let's Plays became a thing.

Truth is, Nintendo isn't entitled to the revenue because the players are providing commentary, which is the purpose of watching them.

This is considered a "transformative" use and is protected by copyright law.

I think the Grumps will just ignore Nintendo's greedy behaviors and play whatever they want 




 True, but usually deals like this would specify when they'd expire, if they do 




 lol, yes, i was being silly 




 Maker studios has signed a deal for their partners to be able to monetize and cover for the full library of music that is registered under Universal Music Publishing. http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1538590/universal-music-publishing-inks-deals-with-fullscreen-maker-studios

"I'm having a waking nightmare,

I'm seeing colors in the sky...

Everybody wants to know about me,

but they don't know about my........

big ol' penis, flopping around,

it's three big feet of pleasure.

Put it in your mouth and put it in your vagine...

Everyone's having a real good time,

when they're hanging around my big floppy penis.

Can't quite stroke it really fast.

Covering three feet of skin with your hand isn't really easy.

Here's how fast I can jack my whole dick,

"Hah, ah, ah, ah, aaahhh."

That includes the back and forth motion,

let's do it again, "Ah aahhh."

"Ah ah ah ah ah ah aaahhhh..."

That's how fast I can jack my peen.

Everybody thinks that they have seen my penis,

but they haven't,

'cuz if they have...

they'd shit themselves.  




 Maker does not own his content, so his partnership with them is irrelevant. Youtube is an international platform and they also do not own his content. 

Okay, I guess I didn't realize (or care) where he lives, but it seems he currently lives in England.

A quick search of England's definition of Fair Use seems to indicate that their copyright laws are nearly identical to America's.

BUT, I just found a neat little thing during my quick research:

Maker studios has signed a deal (as has Fullscreen) for their partners to be able to monetize and cover for the full library of music that is registered under Universal Music Publishing. http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1538590/universal-music-publishing-inks-deals-with-fullscreen-maker-studios

That's a pretty big conglomerate and is likely where he's getting this music from (I don't know though, I've only seen a video or two of his, and immediately had to click away before I destroyed my laptop) 




 I didn't miss it, I just felt like rectifying it. Too many people seem to think hearsay = fact 




 pretty loose with the word "confirmed" aren't you? 




 Sweden doesn't recognize all of the U.S's copyright laws.

There is also no broad statutory limitation of fair use or fair dealing in Sweden, so he's far more protected in this area than anyone from America, where you literally can't even sing a song without the rights to do so, or a mechanical license and royalty payments. 




 Not fact. Straight up myth

Edit: I already received a downvote for being factually accurate, so lemme post this here:

Fair use is a defense one can use if taken to court for using a copyrighted work without permission. 

In its most general sense, a fair use is any copying of copyrighted material done for a limited (less than 30 seconds) and transformative purpose, such as to comment upon, criticize, or parody a copyrighted work. Such uses can be done without permission from the copyright owner.

Game Grumps singing random songs (in most of their cases) even people on youtube singing cover songs are NOT covered by this. It's illegal because it is a violation of U.S copyright law 




 They weren't "assimilated" by them. Too many people fail to understand what a MCN is and what it does. This is what it boils down to; a channel signs with them and they find good brand deals, better CPM rates, advice for growing a fanbase, or production assistance in return for a very small cut of the channel's profits. The end.

Maker doesn't own them, therefore they couldn't have 'assimilated' them. They're still an independent channel. MCNs function like a talent agency.

As for whether they started out **partnering** with Maker, that depends on whether or not Egoraptor and Jon were partnered with them before starting the channel 




 You may now *kiss the bride*  (under his breath) ......ya filthy animal....

 Will Jacques and Arin ever finish off the creators of Sonic 06? 




 man, people will complain about anything 




 I want you to know that I watched the whole video and didn't learn ONE DAMN THING! :) 




 Well, Arin originally conceived of the show as a podcast.

I'm curious as to what the format of it was before they decided to include gameplay 




 Maybe he's just working on something that just hasn't come out yet.

Like more Table Flip or editing Guild Grumps. Or maybe business-y shit. Or some secret, unrevealed projects. 




 you are correct. He's also in others.

 Warning: Mature Content.

I've been looking to create more improvised content on my youtube channel.

I need to get my improvisation chops up because I'm conceptualizing a daily improv show/webseries 




 Why not a monthly Toon Grumps on Grumpout or Arin/Ross's channel? 




 What if they cancelled Game Grumps on April 1st purely by coincidence?

"Oh, Ross, I didn't even realize it was April Fool's Day... they all think we're joking..." 









 lol, the end of your comment had my sides hurtin a bit :D XD 




 There are so many explanations out there, but the gist of it is, it's impossible to put out content on a consistent basis. Therefore, the CPM rates are low (cost of an ad every time it reaches 1,000 people) and when your paycheck is low when you're already only putting out a video every few months, that's impossible to live on.

 Yeah. It looks more artistic and significant with polygonal graphics.

God, I miss the polygon era. Everyone's nostalgic about 16-bit graphics, I'm nostalgic about N64/PS1 graphics

 why does every rap battle on youtube have to steal the format of ERB?

And why are they so quiet? It's like they were recording the lyrics, but didn't want their mom to hear them. Not to mention that they don't enunciate a lot of those words, and rap in mumbles. Did they think it was okay to not be understandable as long as they include subtitles?

I'm not usually critical, but my god, that was horrible
