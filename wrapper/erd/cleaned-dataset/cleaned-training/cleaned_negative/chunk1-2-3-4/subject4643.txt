 Senior animal trainer Mike Alexander and a team of four experts spent a total of 19 weeks preparing the critters for their film debut. Once the animals became accustomed to sitting with the trainers (each squirrel was trained one-on-one), they were taught to pick up a nut and place it in a metal bowl. The bowl was eventually replaced by a conveyor belt for the film.

 I don't think so. I don't remember any scene like that from the movie. 




 Are those greenscreens outside the windows ?? 




 And Hardline. 














 Yeah, it will be a huge difference in audio(compared to 2CH in torrents) as you have a surround system as the blu-rays have uncompressed sound. You may notice a mild difference in video. The color would  appear more vibrant and grainyness and blockiness would be bare minimum. 




 Brazil  




 Each camera captures footage of the fight scene from different angles. This is helps in completing the fight in a single take.  




 As someone who was just like you, I have recently started collecting blu-rays. I think it is really worth if you respect the art form of movies. Here is my piece of advice :

* Learn about the region coding of blu-ray discs and players. Buying a region-free blu-ray player is a great advantage if you want to import from other countries.

* Work you way through bargains and box-sets first. This really helps to start a collection.

* You might wanna wait and see if 4k blu-rays, which will be released by the end of the year are reasonably priced or not. If they are, then you could buy a 4k blu-ray player (If you have a 4k TV or if you are planning to buy so in the near future).

 This is exactly what I thought about Guardians of the Galaxy. The story drags itself around back and forth and doesn't end anywhere but to a sequel. By the way, World War Z wasn't critically acclaimed in the first place. It has 68% on rt and 7/10 on imdb. It was just an 'ok' movie.

 I would add 'King of Comedy' to that list. 









 The uploader put great effort into editing the audio. But, as Stanley Kubrick's interviews are very rare, it was worth for sure. 
This meant that you'd hear Kubrick talk for about 3 or 4 seconds and then have a translator jump in and repeat what he said in French at a louder volume. Usually the translator would step in and cut off the first or last words that Kubrick was saying, or sometimes just talk over the top of him, making it even more difficult to listen to. Maddeningly, the translator would sometimes interject after he said only three or four words! Ciment's English-language questions were spoken over in French simultaneously, often rendering them impossible to hear.

 [For anyone interested about the story in the movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EShApFSrXqw)  




 **Fun Fact** : Walt Disneys last written words were apparently Kurt Russell

As Walt Disney laid on his deathbed, suffering from lung cancer, in 1966, the story goes (later confirmed by Kurt Russell) that he scribbled on a piece of paper the name Kurt Russell. He died never writing another word.  Many have speculated what this could have meant, including the famous actor himself, Kurt Russell who in a 2007 appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live said, Its true. I dont know what to make of that. I was taken into his office one time after he died and I was shown that. Russell was a child actor at the time for Disney, having just signed a ten year contract with the studio.

 [A message to young people from tarkovsky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Vvdtaaprzw)


"What would you like to tell people?"


"I dont know I think Id like to say only that they should learn to be alone and try to spend as much time as possible by themselves. I think one of the faults of young people today is that they try to come together around events that are noisy, almost aggressive at times. This desire to be together in order to not feel alone is an unfortunate symptom, in my opinion. Every person needs to learn from childhood how to be spend time with oneself. That doesnt mean he should be lonely, but that he shouldnt grow bored with himself because people who grow bored in their own company seem to me in danger, from a self-esteem point of view."
