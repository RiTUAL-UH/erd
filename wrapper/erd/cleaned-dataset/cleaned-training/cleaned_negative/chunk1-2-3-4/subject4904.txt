 Ranked games should feature brackets and placement. So yea no stacking.

Angry, no.  I like reminding scrubs what they are.

 ^Huge offender , always with his other "streamers" and "proz"



Go buy some more viewers. 




 Team stack more scrubs.    Takes a lot for me to do more then just lurk, but you guys team stack like WHOA.  See you in the Ranked Games, where you will fall like the brick you are.

 Hi scrubs.

Since you guys decided to riun the 2x XP for me and my wife, we each took a different region and spectated.   We frapped across several games, complied the footage and uploaded as private videos to youtube.    We then gave hirez access.  Personally we identified over 60 players using it across 1 or more games.  I sincerely hope I was responsible for your ban.

 don't eveb waste your time dude. this entire. sub is a place for streamers whoax at 30 viewer to whore more viewers, baddies to take there 1 %. of footage where they killed sone one(not uncomnon for it to be a single kill entire video) abd circle jerk about their narrow view that each class has only one viable loadout.

thet even ban smoke nades in "competitive " play.  scrubs

 Works wll with teams relying on there Artemes to chesee them a win, or making Odin AOE comp, and you pop ulti. 

I often traded the Aura to allies chest for a Frozen mallet since they expect me to follow them, when they should follow the baby wrecking ball, which allowed me to slaughter the enemy.    









 Tim Tebow of gaming? 

Gimme a break, nice win though.
