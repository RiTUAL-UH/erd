 Tortilla Flats by John Steinbeck

I would definitely recommend this book to any veteran transitioning over to the civilian world. It's a really great book that portrays the brotherhood of soldiers and how its a lifelong bond that helps brothers through difficult situations. It does this through the story of 3 poor veterans of World War 1.  




 I disagree. 

I know of many others things that very closely relate to being a parent. Yes, being a parent involves a mass amount of time and dedication, in which you are legally obligated to dedicate such time. However, many other things require lots of time and dedication. The only difference is the ability to give up on those things without legal/social repercussions.

Or maybe youre just passing these people in there off time, what if they use the fuck out of their suv from the hours of 8-5, hours of working people. Hours you most likely do not drive... being a musician and all... 




 Damn dude, your brain is already damaged if you're legitimately concerned and asking this question on Reddit instead of researching it yourself or seeking medical advice from a medical provider. You're done, that brain has been vaporized. 




 Because I can afford it and I like it. I'm sure if you could afford something and liked it, you'd have one.

 That's also the locket that was struck by a projectile while he was a junior enlisted officer. It was given to him by his uncle, who was a great military officer in the American Revolution. Before his marriage to Rachel, Jackson kept a picture of his mother in the lockett. He had it repaired before his wedding and the picture of his mother replaced with Rachel's picture.

 I mean he could have never even fought any of these guys, I mean it is an autobiography, but I like to believe he was the Shaft of his generation. 




 From his narrative, Frederick Douglass went around chesting up to slave owners, learning to read and write through perseverance and deceit, and then became a free man who worked to tear down the institutions of slavery.

 The PDSA Dickin Medal, recognised worldwide as the animals Victoria Cross, is awarded to animals displaying conspicuous gallantry or devotion to duty while serving or associated with any branch of the Armed Forces or Civil Defence Units. The PDSA Dickin Medal is the highest award any animal can receive whilst serving in military conflict.

 After just a couple of hours drifting, the boat exploded. Most believe that a Soviet torpedo hit and sank the Struma. The Turks did not send out rescue boats until the next morning - they only picked up one survivor (David Stoliar). All 767 of the other passengers perished. 









 The festival was staged on the area of a former freight station. The capacity of the enclosed location was limited to 250,000 people,[6] but more than one million visitors were expected, based on the experience of previous years.

Entrance should have been granted at 11:00, but was granted at 12:00 CEST.[7]A 240-metre tunnel from the east and a series of underpasses from the west met at a ramp that was supposed to be the only entrance and exit point of the festival area.[8] A smaller ramp existed between the underpasses from the west. Because of overcrowding, police at the entrance began announcing over loudspeakers that new arrivals should turn around and head back.[9][10] The side of the tunnel that was the entry of the parade area was closed, but people continued to enter the tunnel from the rear, despite being told it was closed. The deaths occurred as the ramp between tunnel underpasses and the festival area became overcrowded.[11][12]

There was some debate as to how the deaths occurred. Some reports suggested they were caused by people falling off a staircase as they tried to escape the tunnel.[13] However, autopsies showed that all of the fatalities were due to crushed rib cages.[13][14] A 2012 scientific analysis of the causes of the disaster dismissed the earlier descriptions of the incident as stampede or crowd panic, and instead found evidence for a phenomenon called "crowd turbulence".[1] 









 After the earthquake, survivors began injecting opium on a large scale. It was easily accessible, due to Bam's location on a trade route for drugs coming from Afghanistan and Pakistan. By 2006, over 50% of men and roughly 15% of women were addicted. The youngest addict was reported to be 11 years of age. Construction workers have historically been large injectors, and the rise in addiction may be attributed to them passing needle onto the public. An anonymous UNICEF worker claimed that drugs were slowing reconstruction and lessening motivation.[37]
