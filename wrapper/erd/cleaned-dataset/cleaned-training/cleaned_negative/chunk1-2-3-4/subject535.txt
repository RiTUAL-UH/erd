Seralini ran a bastardization between a sub chronic toxicity study and a carcinogenicity study, with using only 10 rats per sex per group and running it for 2 years.  
  
Also Seralini did not run any statistical analysis on mortality or tumor prevalence. His data, due to sample size and short duration was inadequate to determine if any of his observed effects were statitically significant.

The retraction statement could have been clearer, and should have referred to the relevant COPE guidelines. The data are inconclusive, therefore the claim (ie, conclusion) that Roundup Ready maize NK603 and/or the Roundup herbicide have a link to cancer is unreliable.

EFSA finds that the study as reported by Sralini et al. is of insufficient scientific quality for safety assessments.

**TLDR:** Seralini's 2012 study is full of elementary mistakes and follows an inadequate protocol that fails to support the conclusions it makes. 




 A big issue with the rat (Seralini) study was the very small sample size, it was small enough that they were unable to do any statistical analysis on tumor prevalence and mortality.  




 Monsanto has never sued over accidental cross pollination, they've sued over willful and intentional isolation of their seed and growing without a license.  




 and that their conclusions were predetermined (e.g., pseudoscience).
  
[Citation Needed] 




 Just to point out that the study that WTCMolybdenum4753 is citing was originally retracted for being of fundamentally flawed study design and conclusion.  




 That's because most GMOs such as corn are hybrids and don't bread true, [you get a similar effect with non GMO hybrids.](http://www.researchgate.net/publication/41560478_TRANSGRESSIVE_SEGREGATION_IN_F2_GENERATION_OF_MAIZE_HYBRIDS_GROWN_FOR_GRAIN_AND_SILAGE) 




 Yes, while there was a time in which sterile seeds/GURT was being developed they have never been brought to market.  




 This is due to them being hybrid varieties, not to being genetically engineered.  




 I stopped caring about Goodall when it came out that she plagiarized her book.  




 Seralini's study was retracted for being fundamentally flawed and down right worthless.  




 The WHO and Lancet studies should be honestly looked at and considered without prejudiced.
  
They are the same study.  




 [Here is a published response to Jack Heinemanns's study.](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14735903.2014.939842) 




 It's just that bird law in this countryit's not governed by reason. 




 I didn't call glyphosate a carcinogen. 
  
Edit: Apparently this was a joke that flew past my head.  




 They should see if they can get the specs of the Surface 3 into a phone, maybe down clock the CPU a bit for thermal/battery reasons.  




 Germany is much more fond of the precautionary principle than the US is.

 [Here is a point by point response to the book/film Genetic Roulette.](http://academicsreview.org/reviewed-content/genetic-roulette/) 




 Yes, some of them are written or funded in part by Monsanto but not all of them. One of the larger ones cited "the AHS" is [not.](http://aghealth.nih.gov/collaboration/) 
  
Also just because a study might be funded or authored by someone who has a conflict of interest does not mean that the science is flawed or inadequate.  




 What developed nations actively ban the use of glyphosate?
  
 There have been issues with farmers dying from direct contact with it since it came into use.
  
The only real cases of farmers dying from glyphosate exposure are easily suicide related when the farmer consumes large amounts of a concentrated solution.

 According to Argentina's union of medical professionals, Fesprosa, glyphosate, not only causes cancer. It is also associated with increased spontaneous abortions, birth defects, skin diseases, and respiratory and neurological disease. 

  
Here are some studies and reviews on the safety and risk of glyphosate.

There was no evidence of a carcinogenic effect related toglyphosatetreatment. The lack of a plausible mechanism, along with published epidemiology studies, which fail to demonstrate clear, statistically significant, unbiased and non-confounded associations betweenglyphosateand cancer of any single etiology, and a compelling weight of evidence, support the conclusion thatglyphosatedoes not present concern with respect to carcinogenic potential in humans.

Note that there was a weak but slight association with multiple myeloma that the authors suggest that further follow up is required. Also this was among applicators who inherently are exposed to significantly higher amounts of glyphosate than end product consumers.

  
Also a re-analysis of the AHS data failed to show the same link between glyphosate and multiple meyloma.

[Epidemiologic studies of glyphosate and cancer: A review](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273230012000943)
  
To examine potential cancer risks in humans, we reviewed the epidemiologic literature to evaluate whether exposure to glyphosate is associated causally with cancer risk in humans. We also reviewed relevant methodological and biomonitoring studies of glyphosate. Seven cohort studies and fourteen case-control studies examined the association between glyphosate and one or more cancer outcomes. Our review found no consistent pattern of positive associations indicating a causal relationship between total cancer (in adults or children) or any site-specific cancer and exposure to glyphosate.

 The few times that I've used the base 5k I've noticed it a little during certain task. Also several reviews have also documented slight performance issues with the base GPU. The performance of the base might not be too big of an issue to you, but that is heavily dependent on the kind of work/programs you will be using.  




 The McLaren F1 is also a lot more expensive and rare then the LaFerrari.  




 There are a handful on the open market, and while Ferrari claims to make "x" amount of their hyper cars they rarely do. The Enzo sold a good 60+ beyond their official figure.  




 Stig's problem was due to the car not being set up properly in terms of its suspension.  




 You do know that GMO tomatoes don't exist on the market right? 




 There are several on the used market already.  




 Or Ikea! 




 I'd stay away from the 5K unless you are going for the top of the line version. The base mobile GPU is going to struggle pushing that many pixels.  




 They are better, but if you run the computer at the quasi full HD resolution you will get the occasional dropped frames and sluggishness.  




 Monsanto has never sued over accidental cross pollination of their crops. 
  
About the Schmeiser case.  

 I'll quote the actual court case.
  
[In late June or early July of 1997, Mr. Schmeiser and his employee Carlyle Moritz hand sprayed Roundup around power poles and in the ditches along the Bruno road where it bordered fields 1, 2, 3 and 4. This was part of his normal weed control practice. Several days after the spraying, he noticed that a large number of canola plants had survived the spraying. To determine why the canola plants had survived the Roundup spraying, Mr. Schmeiser conducted a test in field 2. Using a machine sprayer set to spray 40 feet, he sprayed Roundup on a section of field 2 in a strip along the road. He made two passes, the first weaving between and around the power poles and the second adjacent to the first pass, parallel to the power poles. He testified that by this means he sprayed a good three acres of field 2. According to Mr. Schmeiser's evidence, after some days, approximately 60% of the canola plants sprayed were still alive, growing in clumps that were thickest near the road and thinner as one moved into the field.[23]At harvest time in 1997 Mr. Schmeiser, who was then recovering from a leg injury, instructed Mr. Moritz to swath and combine field 2. Mr. Moritz did so, harvesting the canola in the field as well as the surviving canola along the roadside. The harvested seed was put into the box of a 1962 Ford pickup truck. The box was covered with a tarp and the truck with its tarped load of canola seed was stored in one of Mr. Schmeiser's buildings over the winter.[24]Mr. Schmeiser testified that in the spring of 1998 the seed from the Ford truck was transferred to another truck and taken to the Humboldt Flour Mill for treatment, a normal process to rid the seeds of disease before planting. The treated seed, mixed with untreated seed from his granary ("bin-run seed"), was planted in all or part of each of his nine fields, for a total of 1,030 acres.](http://decisions.fca-caf.gc.ca/en/2002/2002fca309/2002fca309.html)  
  
  
His crop did not magically become 95-98% RR canola purity overnight and the court realized this. Schmeiser was not sued over accidental cross pollination, but over intentionally isolating RR canola plants and planting the seed the following year.

The overall trend is striking. From 1980 until 1987, opium production only gradually increased. However after the defeat of the Soviets, opium production skyrocketed. This alarming trend was affected by a drought that occurred between 1995 and 1998. After the drought during Taliban rule, opium production surged to over 4,000 MT in 2000 (Blanchard 2009, 4). In 2001, the Taliban, caving into international pressure declared opium production illegal (Blanchard 2009, 3). This campaign was very effective, and in 2001, only 200 MT of opium was produced. But, in 2002, when the new, weak Karzai regime took control over Afghanistan, opium production increased and reached record levels, with an unprecedented yield of 8,200 MT, or 193,000 hectares in 2007 (Blanchard 2009, 4). The rise in the opium economy has created many opportunities for insurgent groups, militia, and warlords to finance their operations against one another.

  Trying to blame the life expectancy gap of wealth by saying it is due to obesity is a wild stretch.
  
I'm just saying that you haven't offered any evidence in defense of your original claim. Your data needs to be normalized to take into account obesity and socioeconomic status.  




 Considering that something like 80% of public schools in the US serve fast food
  
[Did you just pull that figure out of your ass? The actual figure is closer to 24%](http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/business/SNDA3summ.pdf) 




 That doesn't prove what your quote is saying is true or not. Your data for expected life and income/education is not normalized to take into account obesity. There could be a chance that the reason why rich people live longer is due to that most are of a healthy weight, for we already know that obesity rates do in fact correlate with poverty and lack of education.  




 They are wrong, just by your weight alone puts you into a higher risk tier and any medical professional worth his/her salt should not ignore the pending risk. It would be like telling a smoker who appears healthy not to worry about the risk of smoking.

 You're doctor might not be aware of the current scientific knowledge on the risk associated with obesity. 




 In this large prospective study, obesity was strongly associated with the risk of death in both men and women in all racial and ethnic groups and at all ages. After we accounted for potential bias owing to preexisting disease and residual confounding by smoking status by using midlife BMI values and restricting the analysis to participants who had never smoked, we found that even moderate elevations in BMI conferred an increased risk of death. The risk among participants who were overweight at the age of 50 years was 20 to 40 percent higher than that among participants who had a BMI of 23.5 to 24.9 at that age. The risk among obese subjects was two to at least three times that of participants with a BMI of 23.5 to 24.9. The risk of death among underweight participants was attenuated.

 For the time being, but the fact that you are obese (BMI34) means you are at increase risk of chronic obesity related illness and disease. 
  
But over time, this group began to develop risk factors for chronic disease. After 10 years about 40 percent had become unhealthy obese, and by the 20-year mark 51 percent had fallen into the unhealthy category, the study found....This study suggests that obese people will eventually develop risk factors such as high blood sugar and bad cholesterol that lead to chronic illness and death, Bell and Freeman said.

To examine potential cancer risks in humans, we reviewed the epidemiologic literature to evaluate whether exposure to glyphosate is associated causally with cancer risk in humans. We also reviewed relevant methodological and biomonitoring studies of glyphosate. Seven cohort studies and fourteen case-control studies examined the association between glyphosate and one or more cancer outcomes. Our review found no consistent pattern of positive associations indicating a causal relationship between total cancer (in adults or children) or any site-specific cancer and exposure to glyphosate.

 There is more to a good screen then just resolution. TN panels are cheap display usually found on budget netbooks, it's an insult that Apple is selling a $1000 machine with such a screen. The pro line on the other hand uses IPS which are vastly superior.  




  Isn't the point of a GMO is that you spray MORE pesticides?

Only herbicides, not insecticides like neonicotinoids. You can spray the same amount of neonics on GMO or conventional crops alike. 




 barely beats the 4-door saloon
  
It crushed it in the drag race, and on a track the difference would be even larger.  




 You said this.
  
Well the traditional approach usually limits the amount you spray because it can in turn damage the plant. GMOs are resistant to the pesticides, so they spray a LOT of them.
  
Which has nothing to do with the use of neonicotinoids. GMOs are not to blame at all for CCD.  




 Neonicotinoids are used on both GMO and non-GMO crops, there are no crops genetically engineered to be resistant to neonicotinoid application because neonicotinoids are an insecticide and not a herbicide.

 I was looking into replacing my old MBP with an Air, but the poor netbook quality screen pushed me off.  




 Except the Air uses a shitty TN display.  




 Pesticides known as neonicotinoids are commonly believed to be a contributor to CCD, Monsanto is not a manufacture of these chemicals. Companies such as Bayer and Syngenta are, blaming Monsanto in this case is idiotic. 




 [The link isn't as strong as is commonly claimed.](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0118748) 




 You are being downvoted because you are wrong. 
  
The primary suspected cause of CCD are neonicotinoids which are an insecticide. They are applied to both GMO   non GMO crops alike and its application is not harmful to plants. 
  
Common GMOs are designed to be herbicide resistant or to produce their own pesticides in the form of bt-proteins. BT-proteins are not a suspected contributor to CCD.  




 Except none of Monsanto's products are believed to be a primary contributor to CCD.  




 Don't think any herbicide has been linked to bee die off.

 Though when the authority figure made a direct order to proceed with the experiment 100% of the participants refused to carry on.
  
[Furthermore, close analysis of the experimental sessions shows that participants are attentive to the demands made on them by the Learner as well as the Experimenter [38]. They are torn between two voices confronting them with irreconcilable moral imperatives, and the fact that they have to choose between them is a source of considerable anguish. They sweat, they laugh, they try to talk and argue their way out of the situation. But the experimental set-up does not allow them to do so. Ultimately, they tend to go along with the Experimenter if he justifies their actions in terms of the scientific benefits of the study (as he does with the prod The experiment requires that you continue) [39]. But if he gives them a direct order (You have no other choice, you must go on) participants typically refuse. Once again, received wisdom proves questionable. The Milgram studies seem to be less about people blindly conforming to orders than about getting people to believe in the importance of what they are doing [40].](http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001426)

The data are inconclusive, therefore the claim (ie, conclusion) that Roundup Ready maize NK603 and/or the Roundup herbicide have a link to cancer is unreliable. Dr. Sralini deserves the benefit of the doubt that this unreliable conclusion was reached in honest error.)](http://www.elsevier.com/about/press-releases/research-and-journals/food-and-chemical-toxicology-editor-in-chief,-a.-wallace-hayes,-publishes-response-to-letters-to-the-editors#sthash.2el1IrEj.dpuf)
  
Here are some responses to the original 2012 Seralini study, finding short comings in both design and statistical methods used.

[Here is the original EFSA report that highlighted short comings and error in the 2012 Seralini study.](http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/2986.htm)   
  
  
EFSA finds that the study as reported by Sralini et al. is of insufficient scientific quality for safety assessments. EFSA concludes that the currently available evidence does not impact on the ongoing re-evaluation of glyphosate and does not call for the reopening of the safety evaluations of maize NK603 and its related stacks.
 
  
[Here is Health Canada's response.](http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/gmf-agm/seralini-eng.php)  
  
  
Based on Health Canada and CFIAs review of this information [the Seralini study], the authors conclusions concerning the long term safety of NK603 corn and glyphosate are not supported
  
[Food Standards Australia/New Zealand](http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/consumer/gmfood/seralini/pages/default.aspx)  
  

  
On the basis of the many scientific deficiencies identified in the study, FSANZ does not accept the conclusions made by the authors [Seralini et al] and has therefore found no justification to reconsider the safety of NK603 corn

Here is a great quote on their opinion on Seralini 2012  
  
It should never have been accepted for publication in a scientific journal. The process of peer review which is usual before acceptance for publication in scientific journals has clearly failed here.

[High Council of Biotechnolgies conclusion.](http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/doc/2986ax1.pdf)
  

  Consequently, the HCB Scientific Committee considers that the paper offers no information supporting the existence of a health risk associated with consumption of maize NK603, whether or not treated with a Roundup herbicide formulation.

**Conclusion on study Results**
  
[The significant results obtained before correction are not biologically coherent overall. However, biological data on the results would be needed to draw a definitive conclusion. At this point in time, in light of the information provided in the publication, the ECEAGs experts consider that the authors interpretations are not sufficiently corroborated by the study data. 
Moreover, during the hearing, the studys authors admitted that this study was not conclusive by itself and that, though subject to improvement, it had the merit of opening up an interesting line of research.

I also like this quote I found by Tom Sanders who is a professor of nutrition and dietetics at King's College London.
  

Republishing data that was faulty in the first place in study design and analysis does not provide redemption. Furthermore, it is now possible to publish almost anything in open access journals 
  
[Also the republication was not peer reviewed.](http://retractionwatch.com/2014/06/26/republished-seralini-gmo-rat-study-was-not-peer-reviewed-says-editor/)
  
Here is a quote of Seralini admitting that the goal of the study was to ban GMOs.
  
["What we want to achieve with this study is a moratorium"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njd0RugGjAg amp;t=10m45s)
  
**TLDR:** Seralini's 2012 study is full of elementary mistakes and follows an inadequate protocol that fails to support the conclusions he makes. 




 So Monsanto is selling the same seed corn, world wide, which is all genetically identical.
  
They are not the same exact seed. The RR trait is commonly back crossed into existing plant lines, 




 Where in the article does it say that? 




 What happens if he just so happens to fall into a life boat? 




 With the new speed limits on the 'Ring I doubt we will see a car beat the 918.  




 Monsanto caused 9/11 and faked the moon landing.  




 It allegedly also crashed into a cow.  




 All GE seeds on the market are fertile, sterile plants have never made it to market.  




 They never made it criminal, they gave no binding voluntary guidelines for labeling back in 2001. 




 Luckily there are no sterile GMO crops on the market.  




 I wish they'd run pikes peak with an F1 car, it would be interesting to see how much faster it would be.  




 And lab-grown diamonds are still expensive as fuck.  




 Except this hasn't been true in years, DeBeers no longer hold a monopoly over the diamond market.  




 This isn't very fun when the matchmaking system doesn't properly account for the advantages gained when playing with a full party.
  
Then make your matchmaking system account for it. Just prioritize matching to take into account group size, Halo 2 did this back on the original xbox.  




 I much as I like the i8 I really wish BMW would make a pure ICE version to compete with the 911   R8.

 IIRC the issues with the tires is that the wire straps to hold them in place rusted and failed. So the water current causes the tires to continuously sift and move about destroying any bit of coral that might grow.  




 Well the PS4 is also 1080 while the X1 is only 900.  




 Just a typo. 




 I'd ask for the world's rarest truffle. Then while they were searching for it, I'd tunnel my way to freedom. Of course, then I'd miss eating the world's rarest truffle...quite the quandary. 




 Yields and cheaper/simpler pest management solutions.  




 Couldn't almost any fruit or vegetable be considered "not vegan" by that logic?
  
Yes, but it boils down to what extent of animal exploitation you are comfortable with. Frankly being 100% vegan is close to impossible, but I really wouldn't recommend allowing the perfect to become the enemy of the good.  




 I understand that there is no way to know 100% on anything, but in the case of almonds it's a pretty cut and dry case of being reliant on a domesticated/managed animal.  




 [Almond trees are pollinated by honey bees which are a non-native and domesticated incest which are trucked in from across the country.](http://www.almonds.com/growers/pollination)
  
In total, we observed 2416 flower visits by honeybees Apis mellifera
(70% of all visits), 378 by wild bees of at least 19 species
(11% of all visits), 327 by hover flies (10% of all visits) and 314
by other insects of various taxa (9% of all visits). Other insects
included flies (primarily Bombyliidae and Muscidae), ants
(Formicidae) and other infrequent visitors (Table S1, Supporting
Information). The most flower visits by wild bees were provided
by the ground-nesting sand bee Andrena cerasifolii
(Cockerell) accounting for more than 2% of all flower visits.
Sweat bees also frequently visited flowers, especially an undescribed
Lasioglossum (Evylaeus) species and Lasioglossum incompletum
(Crawford). These wild bees were present only in
orchards with nearby natural habitat. The blue orchard bee
Osmia lignaria propinqua Cresson, a species that could be managed
for almond production in California (Bosch   Kemp
2002), was only observed once.
