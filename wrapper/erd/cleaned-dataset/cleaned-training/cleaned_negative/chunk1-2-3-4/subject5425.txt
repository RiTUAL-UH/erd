 very cool! 




 very good! 




 very cute! 




 I learned the 7/11 breathing method from a counselor...you breathe in for 7 seconds, then out for 11....this will bring a panic attack under control
Hope this helps! 




 pretty cool idea! 




 very cool! 




 very cool pic 




 I certainly don't mean to wait until they are three to read to them, I am just saying by that age they will learn to enjoy chapter books 




 Seems like your food budget is extremely high...you could easily cut that in half I would think 




 I have figured up how much it costs us for mortgage and utilities.  Me and my boyfriend each put $200 in our joint account a week.  Our expenses are about $1200 a month so we have extra in there for home maintenance, a snowblower, lawn mower, etc.  We each pay our own car insurance, cell phones, and 1/2 of the food...keeps things simple, I only write 3 checks a month from the joint account and all the bills are paid. 




 gorgeous! 




 great pic! 




 awesome! 




 what kind of dog is he? very cute! 




 happens here too 




 great pic! 




 so cute! 




 cool!
 




 very cute...have an upvote 




 Plus I think freezer jam tastes so much better than canned!
 




 Read to your kids alot....as soon as they are 3 or so, start reading chapter books, like just one chapter each night... choose classics like Charlottes Web.  It will give them a love for reading when they learn that  not every story ends in 15-30 minutes...and kids who love to read are smarter, because they learn so much 


































 No, but I am so glad that I just let go...I got three wonderful kids and thats all I need...my point is that divorcees nowadays don't sit around eating bonbons all day 




 nope...raised 3 kids for 20 years, and received child support until the youngest turned 8, and a whole whopping $3000 one time payment of alimony...I refused to fight about it in front of the kids and he got nasty so I just signed the papers...oh and since the divorce he has literally had NOTHING to do with the kids, not even a birthday card...and he earns roughly 100k a year, while I made $20,000...but I do know this, I am MUCH happier now
 




 and Walker himself does not hold a college degree 




 Im no expert, but it sounds to me like you are watering too often...with my plants I water about once a week, being sure to let the top inch or so of soil dryout before I water again, and yes, remove all dead leaves, this will help the plant....when I water I water until it runs out of the bottom, making sure to let it drain well and not leave any water in the saucer, since many plants do not like their feet wet
Hope this helps
 




 Not really, as business doesn't get to write laws without the cooperation of government.

I think you meant to say Government doesn't get to write laws without the cooperation of Big Business. 




 I have personally worked with quite a lot of people who actually SHOULD have been on disability...bad knees...bad back...one lady who walked completely hunched over all of the time...mostly age related issues, but I had to bust my hump twice as hard when I worked with them, because even though they were trying, they just couldn't do it...I think SS needs to be expanded myself 




 My charter bill for the same services was about 185 a month, I called a couple of times to see if I could get it lowered, no dice, so I cancelled my cable completely,about 2 months ago which dropped my bill to 95 a month, they called me tonight and offered to give me back my cable for $103 for the next 12 months.  I took it because my bf loves sports and it's only another $8 a month. 




 nice!!
 




 Republicans do not check facts....they have Bill oReilly do it for them
 




 If this is really what's best for America, then I guess the children of those people who use drugs just deserve to suffer even more than they already do with parents as drug addicts huh?
 




 You can easily make some really pretty plant hangers using clothesline and a ring...google it...it'll cost about $2 or so, and would be nice with a christmas cactus or poinsettia
 




 The Fact alone that 4 BILLION DOLLARS was spent on the Mid-term elections should be a wake-up call to everyone.  Just think about what that money could have done to make our country a better place to live!
Public funding only for campaigns really needs to happen.  Our representatives don't spend very much time working for us at all.  They are out fundraising most of the time.  I read somewhere recently that they usually are in Washington 2 days a week tops. 




 very cool 




 WOW! AWESOME pic!! 




 haha so cute! 




 very cute! 




 awww...what kind of dog is he? 









 cute one! 
























 hmmm seems like he overslept and didn't get a chance to read his script before the show  




 GO BERNIE!!!
 




 Point taken.  You are right.
 




 I'm serious...I wish people would stop judging other people by their skin color, religious beliefs, orientation etc.  I am not proud to be a white american. 




 I cannot understand why this seems to be a partisan issue at all.  Sexual abuse is the same regardless of your political or religious beliefs.  Why would these politicians speak out in support of sexual abuse? 




 who knows? Probably millions, those sneaky bastards! /s 




 awesome!!! It's going to Bernie!!! 




 I wish I could upvote this more than once.  PERFECT!!!! 




 *You ask for it.*

So you think she should be a beggar?  

Do you give money to homeless people with signs?   




 I never looked at her as a "charity case"  She was a kind, loving woman who did the right thing, as did her husband and healthcare costs made her a charity case 




 wouldn't you consider a sick person with say cancer needing treatment or someone who needs insulin to treat diabetes as someone who might be desperate?  And where I live anyways if that person does not have a college degree they are probably making $15/hour or less...now if you add health problems, or mental health issues, caring for aging parents, addiction or any other stress, don't ya think we need to help them out?  and collectively we can make sure that those basic needs are met.  I think you are assuming people just don't want to work or pay, they just want a free ride, and sure those people are out there, but they are in the minority
For example we had a family friend when I was young who was 58 and her husband died of brain cancer.  She had health issues herself don't remember what I was young, but I do know she had metal rods in her for something. She had been a stay at home mom and her husband had worked for a place that built big bulldozers and equipment.  Well they weren't rich, but had a nice home and had saved for retirement.  When her husband died they had drained most of the savings on his medical bills then when she got sick and had to have surgery and therapy etc. she had nothing left.  She applied for aid and was denied because she owned a house, so she sold her house and moved into low income housing, had to get rid of her dog because he couldn't be there it was just such a sad story and she was such a nice sweet lady.  And all this time she was so sick too.  I guess that has made an impact on me and I don't want to see that happen to anyone. 




 I think you see taxes as robbery, and I don't so that is where we disagree...I am all for universal healthcare, because I don't want people whether they are family or strangers to die without healthcare so that I can have a little more money in my 401k 




 I would hope that my life is more important than anyones money, and if  i was starving, I can't say I wouldn't steal out of someones garden or something to stay alive....do you think that is bad? 




  I am outraged. I'm outraged that people are insured who should be paying out of pocket or going without treatment. I'm outraged that, to pay for it, the government has to either tax (meaning I lose money), borrow (keeping the interest rate low which means since I'm an investor rather than a borrower I lose money), or inflate the currency (which, again, since I have investments makes them worth less and I lose money

You believe some people who can't afford to pay should go without treatment?  Not everyone can afford it, but everyone is somebody's  
son, daughter, mother, father, brother, sister, or grandparent...if poor people get sick, do you believe that we should leave them to die? Is money more important that a persons life? 




 Well, I'd be super suspicious of a hello kitty wallet too /s
 




 Very well said.  I don't agree with you  about the size of government or that it is evil, it is the politics you cannot trust, but your position on vaccines makes sense to me.  I think government should be bigger with lots more us citizens working in and for the government, so that more people benefit and are better represented.  I am pro choice, and completely agree that the government has no business telling you what to do with your body  




 hear here
 




 A race between Sanders and Paul would make me proud to be an American again
 




 Go home Arizona...you're drunk
 




 


cheeseheads
 




 The Republicans have a message??  I thought they just hated on the liberals...what exactly IS their message???
 
























 My honest guess at this is that the black guy who was carrying the concealed weapon would have been shot by the police when they arrived. 




 I guess all politics aside, I would feel uncomfortable attending a church where people felt the need to carry a weapon. 




 I think they also underestimate how Bernie can motivate people to vote.  Hillary is just the same ole same ole...Bernie gives you something to vote FOR not against. 




 So the solution is.....more guns? 




 Why don't they have HRC on and start asking her questions about Bernie Sanders and his stance on the issues? 




 Thanks for the heads up! 




 This needs to go viral! 




 Just when you think you couldn't love him even more.... 




 Watched and shared 









 WTF???? 




 yes, but that was BEFORE he talked to his corporate donors, they gave him the go ahead
 




 Thanks for the link...took me about 2 minutes to email both of my Senators 




 Happy dance!
 




 Seriously, this guy is running for President? 




 whoops...she really meant to say the people of SC, not her bosses the CEOs /s 




 i love this idea!! Pint of whatever for me, donate that same amount to bernie 




 hmmm...how about a pint for me and a pint for Bernie...donate the cost of a pint of ice cream to his campaign....
or maybe a pint for me, and a pint for the Revolution
 




 Hillary Hate is rampant in the Republican party.  Did you know there is actually a PAC called stop hillary now and their one goal is to end Hillary Clintons Political career??? 




 Power to the People! Go Bernie! 




 Go Bernie!
