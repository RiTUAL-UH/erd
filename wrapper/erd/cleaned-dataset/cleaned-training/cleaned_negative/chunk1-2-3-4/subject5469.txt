McGILLAN, JOHN M. "SHORTY" - Delirium Tremens - Died Aug 22, 1891 - Age 30 Years  

He Never Blamed the Booze! 

His liver needed scraping and his kidneys had the gout, He swallowed lots of bitters 'til at last he cleaned 'em out, His legs were swelled with dropsy 'til he had to cut his shoes, He blamed it to the doctors, but he never blamed the booze! 

Then he had the tremens, and he tackled rats and snakes, First he had the fever, then he had the shakes, At last he had a funeral and the mourners had the blues, And the epitaph they carved him ..."He Never Blamed the Booze!"

"An advisory alert has been issued for a remote  volcano in the western Aleutian Islands after dozens of earthquakes were reported in the area, an early sign of volcanic unrest. 

The change means that five volcanoes being monitored in Alaska are now simultaneously active, the most in recent memory, said Matt Haney, a research geophysicist at the Alaska Volcano Observatory. "

Too many quakes from Indonesia to the southern Islands, Chile, Acapulco and volcano related swarms in the Aleutians.

 /r/StormComing is simply this: an Archive of Earth Changing Disasters and Events, manmade or natural.

It's not a place for HAARPtards, Climate Change Deniers, Flat-Earthers, or Eschatology/Rapturists to post theorems. And as we want to attract sane, logical redditors, we don't want to hear about how radiation is good for everyone.

This sub is best read using 'new' rather than 'hot' or 'top' as it is an archive of events.

We cover these types of global stories:

* Extreme Weather (including watches/warnings), torrential rains, record breaking wind events, temperatures, tornados, hurricanes, etc.

* Geologic: Landslides, earthquakes, sinkholes, etc.

* Floods and flood watches/warnings.

* Solar: Solar Storms that may have impact on Earth.

* Disease: Disease outbreaks of all kinds, including rabies threats.

* Food Recalls.

* Near Earth Objects: Upcoming close encounters with Meteors.

* Mass animal die-offs.

* Nuclear accidents and events.

* Oil and chemical spills/explosions/fires.

* Wildfires.

* Drought and impacts of drought, ie: agricultural impacts, etc.

If you want to add an Earth-changing or disaster story from the news or reliable source, please do. Since headline writers often fail, feel free to editorialize titles to fill in important details from the story- especially the location.

We have already heard from someone who saw a flash flood forecast here that saved them from swimming home from work. Other redditors have been alerted to Tornado Outbreaks and took safety precautions. So we feel we are fulfilling the purpose of the sub.

As /r/StormComing is an archive of events, there is nothing subjective about it. Downvoting anything here would be as stupid as downvoting an encyclopedia entry.

Feel free to x-post to other reddits, especially reddits that are geographically related to the area the event or warning concerns.

If you mod a related sub I'll be happy to share sidebar links. If you would like to co-mod this sub, send me a pm.

 Over the past year I have been noting rainfall records broken worldwide. People describing these events use the words: torrential, apocalyptic, unusual, extraordinary. I remember an elderly Japanese lady describing one such event (in Japan last year) in this way "The water was coming down so hard I could barely breathe, I felt like I was breathing water."

As stated, I started noting a drastic increase in these events last year- out of past 40 years of serious weather watching. 

[Here is the post I made on it 2013](http://www.reddit.com/r/StormComing/comments/1jzh7q/unheard_of_rains_861388_2013_a_few_samples/).

----------------------

Note from Kolby:

The anomalous movement of the Jet Stream continues to reflect the findings of Jennifer Francis (Rutgers) and her associates. 

In a nutshell: that warming in the Arctic is creating deeper meandering loops in the Jet Stream (Rossby Theory) and that this is *slowing* the Jet Stream, leading to 'stuck' highs and cut off lows. In other words, weather systems that would quickly pass or not be as intense are now intense and longer lasting. For example: two weeks of intense rain instead of an hour or a day. These deeper loops are also pulling in weather systems from deeper south or farther north.

Great little explanatory video: http://youtu.be/_nzwJg4Ebzo

In this case, it is superheated air being pulled up into the UK from Spain by a deep 'loop' in the Jet Stream.

 I have a good friend I have been gaming with for some time. He is an Iraq War Vet who did 6 tours. He cannot work now and lives in a very tiny town. He very much relies on his friendships in Warcraft for companionship and to provide 'something to do every day' in his life. 

His old laptop completely quit a few days ago and he has a HP Pavilion DV6 2057 cl - that he has been trying to get the game downloaded to ever since. He says it just needs a hard drive, but I think it is too old. It keeps giving him an error that states the Javascript cannot be found and another message about the graphics card being out of date.

I desperately want to do something but am in an extremely tight spot, financially. I don't even have a tree this year. 

I am heartsick that he will be spending the holidays 'alone' more or less. I thought about requesting assistance from his online friends- but he is very proud and would be upset if I did so. He needs a hard drive for the HP or even a cheap laptop that is just good enough to run the game. 

Any assistance or advice would be highly appreciated.  Thank you very much in advance.

To clarify, I posted disturbing images of health officials leaving the Ebola patients apartment in Dallas- making comparisons to recent images. 

I posted to /r/Stormcoming, x-posted to /r/Dallas   /r/texas 

The Stormcoming was immediately upvoted . 

The Dallas and Texas posts were immediately- within minutes of posting- downvoted to oblivion.

This is not something you would expect from regular redditors who want to know what the hell is going on in their areas and would have no reason to want to hide anything. 

Now I see the one on /r/Stormcoming is getting hammered.

Wtf is going on here? 







































 A few days ago- right after the Dallas Ebola patient was diagnosed, [this image was in the news.](http://static2.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1961092.1412271234!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/article_970/ebola.jpg) It shows 'Dallas Health Officials leaving the Ebola patients apartment'. 

([from this news story](http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/80-people-dallas-monitored-ebola-article-1.1960700))

They are in normal business wear. There is no 'clean' station in sight, no hazmat, no gloves, not even shoe booties. You can assume from here they got in their cars and went back to the office, maybe stopping for coffee or lunch along the way; who knows?

Now today we see [this story.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/dallas-ebola-case-spurs-concern-about-hospital-readiness/2014/10/03/4afa10b2-4b30-11e4-a046-120a8a855cca_story.html?tid=pm_national_pop)

I found it fascinating that 'before the gate of Lud' Jesus will kill Satan. This is in Islamic lore. The town is called Lydda now- but the Gate of Lud still stands. I am going to explore more about this today.

But it is sadly ironic that people would try to block others from learning of a really interesting connection. Especially when a clear trend in Kings stories that the characters with blinding, personal dogmas tend to be the true villains.

 Kristie Baugus Moon was dating Michael Pearcy when she disappeared 10/27/1999. [According to her mother, he was the last one to see her.](http://www.charleyproject.org/cases/m/moon_kristie.html) 

In 2001, Sherrif Ron Wyatt and his partner stopped Michael Pearcy.

["Wyatt and his partner stopped a car driven by Michael Pearcy who was wanted for questioning by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation."](http://www.bpnews.net/4392/bivocational-pastor-recovers-from-roadside-shooting)

Michael Pearcy shot Sherrif Ron Wyatt and Wyatts partner then shot Michael Pearcy to death.

[Michael Pearcy is the son of Mark Pearcy- both Mark and Jeff Pearcy are under arrest for being accessories and accessories after the fact in the Holly Bobo kidnapping and murder.](http://www.wsmv.com/story/26480995/remains-found-in-decatur-co-belonged-to-holly-bobo)

It is difficult to find anything on Kristie Moon. It doesn't look like there were serious searches or investigations held. It's as if no one even wanted to acknowledge her disappearance. This is the exact opposite from the Holly Bobo kidnapping where hundreds of people turned out to search and the police held numerous press conferences.

Here is where it gets strange. Sheriff Wyatt, in three different interviews over the years (all before the Bobo kidnapping), has given three different explanations as to why he pulled over Michael Pearcy. Once for 'bad tail light' and once because Pearcy had been "doing something illegal earlier in the day." The original article states that Wyatt pulled Michael Pearcy over because he was wanted for questioning by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. Which I presumed was over the disappearance of Kristie Moon. 

Now from the Associated press - a statement by Sheriff Wyatt thats a jaw dropper:

["Rita Foley with The Associate Press said that Sheriff Wyatt never expected something like this to happen in the small tight-knit community. He was visibly shaken by the news of Holly's disappearance."](http://www.examiner.com/article/holly-bobo-big-city-crime-comes-to-small-tight-knit-community-safety-tips)

Excuse me? This sheriff was shot by Michael Pearcy, the suspect in the disappearance of Kristie Moon and son of one of the guys busted in the Bobo kidnapping. 

And Sheriff Wyatt acts all surprised, like nothing like this had ever happened in Parsons, Tennessee?

Why did Wyatt give several reasons why he pulled over Michael Pearcy in the first place? Was the TBI investigating Pearcy in Kristies disappearance? It's very hard to dig up any information on this. 

We can't ask Sheriff Wyatts partner- he was killed a few weeks later while investigating a car wreck.

I just know that something stinks to high heaven in Parsons, TN.

Pheonix = 'supposedly'.  




 What the fuck language is that?
 




 Being stopped for no reason is humiliating and destroys police-community relationship.

I remember being taught in school that we were fighting the Cold War because in 'those evil countries' the police could stop people on the street for no reason, spy on them, arrest them on the smallest pretense. We went to Vietnam supposedly to prevent the spread of that behavior around the world. My beloved Uncle died for this. Now to see it codified into law and todays law enforcement officers performing it is both enraging and deeply saddening. 

Stop- just stop. This is not fascist/soviet Russia.

3. What is the origin of unique, advanced technologies that are discovered on occasion (such as the [Antikythera Mechanism](http://www.antikythera-mechanism.gr))?

4. What is the origin of similar ancient stories of massive wars that occurred on earth, many of which involved [air transit and nuclear type damage](http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/23630-ancient-atomic-bombs/), such as the Indian Vedas. 

I have been considering this since the 1990's.  




 So I was watching [a video on youtube of police officers shooting a pregnant woman](https://youtu.be/UKJZanyNUhE) who had a knife. 
I am always interested in comments and saw this interchange between Russians, and translated it:

   **Once again, afraid so killed a man/woman shoot to kill, this nation can be defeated in less than a month**

 
*Roman Brovko 1 day ago*

   Executing = fright?

 
*Antonioni Bardzini 1 day ago*

   + Roman Brovko they could safely shoot in the legs but they always shot in the chest, let the will of man will kill.


So it is how I see this 'new generation' of police officers in the U.S.. They can't manage themselves and have a strong streak of cowardice- and so they use the gun. Interesting that others, including these Russians, now see American males as cowards.

**Attorney: North Charleston police officer felt threatened before fatal shooting**
-----------------------------------------------

Slager


A North Charleston police officer felt threatened last weekend when the driver he had stopped for a broken brake light tried to overpower him and take his Taser.

Thats why Patrolman 1st Class Michael Thomas Slager, a former Coast Guardsman, fatally shot the man, the officers attorney said Monday.

Investigators collect evidence after a North Charleston police officer fatally shot a man Saturday morning.

Slager thinks he properly followed all procedures and policies before resorting to deadly force, lawyer David Aylor said in a statement.

   This is a very tragic event for all of the families, Aylor said. I believe once the community hears all the facts of this shooting, theyll have a better understanding of the circumstances surrounding this investigation.

Mondays developments filled in some of the blanks in what was South Carolinas 11th police shooting of the year. Authorities publicly identified Slager, an officer with the city since December 2009, and gave his reason for the traffic stop that led to the fatal confrontation. Police documents also revealed that Slager announced within seconds why he had fired.

Shots fired, and the subject is down, he said into his radio, according to an incident report. He took my Taser.

Walter Lamer Scott, 50, of Meadowlawn Drive in West Ashley died soon after the encounter near Craig Street and Remount Road.

He has been arrested about 10 times in his lifetime, mostly for failure to appear for court hearings and to pay child support.

The only indicator of violence in his past came with his first arrest in 1987 on an assault and battery charge.

Slager, 33, served honorably in the military before joining the North Charleston Police Department more than five years ago, Aylor said.

*He has never been disciplined during his time on the force, the attorney added.*

Slager was on a boarding team when he served in the Coast Guard in Port Canaveral, Fla., his personnel file showed. The 91 pages of documents were released Monday after The Post and Courier filed a S.C. Freedom of Information Act request.

He passed courses on how to use the Taser X26 when he was hired in North Charleston and performed well on shooting tests with his .45-caliber Glock 21. Supervisors indicated in performance reviews that he met expectations as an officer and kept a tidy patrol car.

Of the two complaints in his file, one dealt with a residents allegation of unnecessary use of force.

Slager went to the mans Delaware Avenue home in September 2013 to investigate a burglary. When the resident opened the door for Slager, the burglary victim yelled that he wasnt the suspect, the documents stated.

The man also insisted that he wasnt the perpetrator, but he later told internal investigators that Slager threatened to use a Taser against him if he didnt come outside. When the man followed the order and stepped outside, he said Slager Tased (him) for no reason and ... slammed him and dragged him.

But another officer there said Slager had been forced to use the device during a struggle. The investigators exonerated Slager of wrongdoing.

Slager will keep working during a State Law Enforcement Division investigation into whether Saturdays shooting was justified, but Pryor said he would be on administrative duty.

While the police released Slagers file, one lawmaker said the episode again points out the need for body-mounted cameras whose footage can stave off community speculation.

The city is expected to get 115 of the devices through $275,000 in state funding for that and other anti-crime initiatives.

Rep. Wendell Gilliard, D-Charleston, said it cant come soon enough. Gilliard has authored legislation to require police agencies to outfit their officers with cameras. As an alternative, he also offered a bill calling for a study of such programs. But he expressed frustration because the measures had not advanced.

People will say Im using this (shooting) as a springboard, he said. But Ive said these types of incidents will continue, and when they do, its going to be unfortunate that we are not using modern-day technology to stop the speculation and rumors.

The authorities have not said whether anyone else saw Slagers struggle with Scott.

No one called Charleston Countys 911 Center after the gunfire, and Slagers communications with dispatchers will not be made public until SLED approves it, county spokeswoman Natalie Hauff said.

SLED spokesman Thom Berry said prosecutors also would have to review the recordings and be agreeable and amenable to their release.
Quickly escalated

North Charleston community leaders have mentioned the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., in urging residents not to grow violent in light of Scotts death. But, like Missouri police said of Brown, Slager saw Scott as a threat when the officer decided to pull the trigger.

Around 9:30 a.m. Saturday, Slager noticed a Mercedes-Benz sedan with a brake light that was out and not working, the police spokesman said. He stopped his cruiser behind the sedan that had pulled into Advance Auto Parts at 1945 Remount Road.

What started out as a routine traffic stop quickly escalated after the driver fled, Slagers attorney said.

Scott ran down Craig Road, which parallels the stores parking lot and stretches southward toward the Singing Pines community. A passenger in his car stayed put.

Slager told other officers through his radio that he had gotten into a foot chase, according to the report. The police have not given details about the confrontation that followed behind the Mega Pawn shop at 5654 Rivers Ave.

But with other officers on the way to help, Slager announced on his radio that he had deployed his Taser, according to the report. But it didnt work.

The statement from Slagers attorney, though, did not say that Slager actually fired the device. Aylor said he could not offer further clarification until the officer talks with investigators.

When confronted, Officer Slager reached for his Taser  as trained by the department  and then a struggle ensued, Aylor said. The driver tried to overpower Officer Slager in an effort to take his Taser.
Felt threatened

Seconds later, the report added, he radioed that the suspect wrested control of the device. Even with the Tasers prongs deployed, the device can still be used as a stun gun to temporarily incapacitate someone.

Slager felt threatened and reached for his department-issued firearm and fired his weapon, his attorney added.

The report indicated that Slager fired multiple times, but it was not specific.

Backup officers did first aid and CPR on Scott until paramedics showed up. But Scott was pronounced dead.

Loved ones have said that Scott was a family man who recently got engaged. They insisted that he wasnt violent.

His most serious arrests came decades ago, according to his SLED rap sheet.

County police officers arrested him in 1987 on a charge of assault and battery, and he was convicted in 1991 of possession of a bludgeon.

Ten years passed before he was arrested twice in 2001 on contempt charges. He would face several similar charges occasionally during the next decade until his last arrest in 2012.

He also had convictions from 2008 for driving under suspension and having an open alcohol container in his car.

Anthony Scott met with the police near the scene soon after his brother was shot. The report did not specify, though, whether he had been the passenger in the Mercedes.

The police took his cellphone as evidence. The next day, he promised in a public statement to find out the truth about what happened.

 I will be posting warnings / reports through the day here as long as I can. 










































































 A large number of companies capture voice prints of anybody that calls them and have been doing so for a number of years. None of them disclose that they are capturing your voice print even though they allegedly are doing so as a form of two-factor authentication. Then they can associate that voice print with accounts, purchases, etc.


When combined with voice prints from other companies it becomes easier for something like the NSA to be able to identify an individual by voice print - they don't have to have their name - regardless of whose phone they may be using. Plus that allows them to associate that individual to the person whose phone they used. That would include identifying people speaking on conference room phones where many individuals can be speaking over the same line on the same call from the same phone.


If recording devices are built to produce voice recordings using the same telephone voice structure the intelligence agencies could then potentially identify all of the people speaking in a room for example without there being a phone at all if a listening device were there or nearby. 













































































































 I see more and more posters to this sub taking screenshots in dark, poorly lit places or worse, under colored lighting. No one can see the colors of the Op's x-mogs, rendering the post basically worthless.  

Leaves me wondering if the x-mogs in these dark, blurry, poorly lit screenshots look horrible or great. 

Now, get your toon to a nice, naturally lit area, (Dal, Elwynn, Jade Forest, Barrens, to name a few) zoom in so your toon is not 1/8th of an inch high in the pic and turn up your graphics. Click and post.

Thank you!!

 I love this. The eye looks so ancient and somehow wise. It looks like a combination of 3d elements with painted art.
