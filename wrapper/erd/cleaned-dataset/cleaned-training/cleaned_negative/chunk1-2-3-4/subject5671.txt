 Go Blue! 




 Aren't all games free if you do it right? :P 




 Lights,

You are coming to Phoenix on Halloween. Going anywhere to hang out after your show or going straight to the airport? 




 Don't listen to Mrknowitall666.

What he is referring too is a Currency Transaction Report (CTR) which is done by any bank when someone deposits or withdrawals $10,000.01 in a day. 

When this is done the bank will ask you for your ID and get information from you such as your employer and what you do for work. They do send all this information to the government.

Now if you owe back taxes, child support, etc. YES this money will be alerted and subsequently have your account frozen. If you are not in this situation you have NOTHING to worry about. 


TL:DR

If you are an honest citizen deposit that shit into your bank do not deposit it over time or sit on it at home.

I did this shit daily in banking.


EDIT: Added bonus unless you trigger the $10k amount in a day nothing gets reported at all to anyone except maybe a banker to sell you shit you probably don't need. 




 this photo was kept in excellent condition. I can't even keep my clean laundry from getting wrinkled

 Fuck Ohio, GO BLUE!
 




 Waiting for people to get off the phone so I could use the internet to play muh games 




 Still sat in economy too. 




 And there it is.. the realization your cities sports teams are terrible. lolol

Last time we won the series...80's.. but last I checked we still have more than you :D

 lol

Red Wings  Blackhawks
Tigers  Sox/Cubbies
and lets also look at the NFL last year - Lions  Bears (but we both know the Lions haven't been relevant since Sanders)

You can have basketball and continue losing to the 8 seed in the playoffs. 




 lol such a fucking tool. It's not my fault Chicago sports hasn't been relevant in years or they choke hard on a big black dick (Bulls). 

Tell your boys to play better next year. :) 




 Not my fault you guys can't win when it matters most :) 




 Go Tigers! 




 Damn.. upvote for tight jeans! 





























 Ahhh so it's from a crematorium????

Nice.. Glad I get to spend part of my day smelling that crap on my way to and from work.

 




 Hey sorry for the delay. No I didn't go. My ex had to cancel since her car needed to get repaired. I need to get with her to reschedule it but with the holidays basically here her and I have both been busy with family stuff.

 




 Ok, this is bothering me because I can't figure it out. lol.
On I-17 between Jefferson and Grant there is this awful smell. I have to go through this every day and I just want to know what it is. I have even detoured through the area trying to figure it out and I couldn't.

Is there a plant over there? A factory of some sort? I don't even know how to describe the smell other than its awful lol 




 I thought this was cute till I saw the cast come through.. :(
 




 My brain...it hurts.. 




 They have science consultants on the show. I'd imagine very accurate!

 ahh yes.. you are right! my bad, thanks for that correction.. Spinato's is another place I have heard great things about too though!!  




 The Codfather (Bell Road/16th st) (next to Santisi I think) is incredible. Best fish/chips I have had.

If you are looking for nightclubs, I have been to Axis/Radius and enjoyed it. 
 




 lol, well my friend let me tell you. Sheriff Arpaio is anti-illegal immigration. He routinely sets up stings to capture illegals who have crossed the border. Seeing as that we are so close to the Mexico border many wrongfully accuse the Office of being racist toward the Hispanic community. This is not true. The Office has successfully capture illegals from Canada and European countries. The majority is Hispanic however. The media HATES the Sheriff and routinely conducts reports on him. As a result the public has seemed to believe that all employees are racist toward Hispanics. This is not true though. Many of us have no ill feelings toward any culture or race. I am sure some out there have prejudices but I can't speak to that.   




 I love magnum's. I am not a smoker, but I have been getting more into wines and such. They have great prices, friendly staff, and they are very knowledgeable. I am not a wine expert or really any type of alcohol expert. Anything you recommend I should try? I am not a fan of reds and when it comes to liquor, I typically only drink vodka. I would like to get into some whiskey's and such but not sure what to try and how to try it i.e. with/without ice, etc. 




 Win! 




 That poor ZL1 :(

 I had this crush on a girl in high school for years. After we graduated she said to me, "I really like you and wished you would have asked me out."

I told her at that time my feelings for her and about the crush and she said, "oh I was just kidding around I didn't really mean that" and she walked away laughing. 




 OP is really the vandal! 




 All it takes is one little fight. 




 winner!
 




 Often called pears.... 




 The bathroom at Lafayette Coney Island in Detroit.. 

Anyone who has been there knows what I'm talking about.. 

The walk to the bathroom is terrifying. If you survive the trip you must then attempt to avoid hitting your head on the pipe that is in the bathroom. Once successfully completed beware of the cockroaches coming to take advantage of you with your pants down.

 I was really hoping to find a post from one of the girls who received a rose.. that would have been awesome.


Either way, cool video. 




 You didn't take it to Lafayette Coney Island?!?


It was nice seeing all the pictures of "home" though! 




 And that's why you always leave a note 




 I have always thought braces on a woman are attractive. The woman who cuts my hair has braces and I think it makes her way hotter. 




 Can someone teach that kid how to tie a tie?
