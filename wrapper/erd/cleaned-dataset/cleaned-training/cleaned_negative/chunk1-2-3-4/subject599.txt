 Not necessarily, there's a lot of foreign tourists in New York City and a lot of very distracted tourists. Let's face it, when lots of people go on vacation, they seem to turn their common sense off. I've seen it in National Parks, I've seen it in big cities. 




 Henry being a KGB agent working for the FBI . . . that's some The Departed level conning there. 




 New York City real estate is amazingly insane right now. Lots of very wealthy foreigners (especially from Russia and China) are using it as an investment vehicle, a place to store their money. I was listening to a podcast earlier this year and one of the hosts said that he had a friend who lived in a building in the Chelsea area and he is usually the only person in the building because all of the other apartments are owned by foreigners who are rarely ever there. 




 Probably tourists. 




 It really needs to be updated on the inside. A lot of that price has to do with location - Gramercy Park is a lovely neighborhood. I bet it will end up selling around $42 million. 




 This is a photograph of the AP Wire Bulletin that was received by KHOU in Houston on the night of April 29, 1975 (US time), announcing that South Vietnam had surrendered. 




 This is a photo of the wire bulletin that was received by KHOU in Houston (When Saigon fell it was April 30, 1975 in Vietnam, but April 29, 1975 in the US). 




 As someone who lives in a state with a big border with Mexico, I believe that there is very little that American politicians can do to stop illegal immigration. So long as there are economic/social hell holes south of the US, people will try to come here illegally.

 It's interesting how big of an impact the Fall of Saigon had on Houston and this region. I had so many classmates who were born in Vietnam and came over in 1975 or a few years later when Vietnamese fled Vietnam in boats. 




 I've seen a lot of these for New York City, interesting to finally see one for Houston. 




 Well done, bravo. 




 These days I feel anything connected to the term "Danger Zone" is now Archer property. 




 In some ways it happens everywhere, when a cold (or cool) front is moving in, it usually causes a warm up, sometimes significant, in the days before the front moves through. 




 Yep, and once you're arrested, because of politics, the DA will try to get you to take a plea even when the evidence is weak. They hate dismissing anything. 




 I stopped watching a couple episodes into the second season. 




 A concept I picked up some time ago was you can't trust a jailhouse snitch cause they'll say anything to get out of their charge, but a prison snitch, more believable because the stakes are much higher considering how snitches can be treated in prison.

 Three arrests in the early 1970s for petty crimes such as vandalism and public indecency did not prevent Woodfield from being selected in the 1974 NFL Draft by the Green Bay Packers as a wide receiver, in the 17th round (428th pick). Woodfield tried to establish himself with the Packers during Coach and General Manager Dan Devine's last season but he could not shake his problems with a trip across the country. He signed a contract in February 1974 but was cut during training camp, failing to make the team's final roster. 




 I second this. 




 Click bait doesn't bother me. 




 I'm going to say that they're incorrect about The Woodlands, seeing as Woods was the maiden name of Mitchell's wife, heck the outdoor performance venue there is the Cynthia Woods Mitchell Pavilion.  




 To me, The Strain is a fun campy type of TV show that is perfect for summertime - I don't expect greatness, just entertainment.

 Been on mobile and I've been referring to the car in my original post this whole time, sorry. The new Impalas (which aren't regular police issue) are really nice, especially the LTZ, which is essentially a Cadillac without the up pricing. Have seen an unmarked new style Impala, not an LTZ, outside the City Hall in NYC.

 No, Chevy's latest police vehicle is the Caprice PPV, which was introduced in 2013. 




 I don't think so, they she passed out   they she acted, I think he drugged her. 




 People today fail to realize marriages back then were more like business contracts. 




 I always read he was a vain man, if only Washington had made his admiration for Arnold more clear to the man himself ... 




 I'm guessing it was his university/college robe and cap. 




 Yeah, it took me a bit to recognize him. 




 I know members from Nation of Islam have been doing that too. 




 I think she was just seriously drugged. 




 At the end, with her weird facial ticks, her vibe reminded me of a Stepford Wife - Ogre gave her some kind of powerful drink. 




 I'm in Alief and most places around here have no squeegees outside or available inside. 




 Looks like a Caprice PPV. 




 Close Up of Cruiser http://i.imgur.com/FBm6ok8.jpg 




 There's another cruiser in flames now. 
Edit: http://i.imgur.com/4wDInV9.jpg 




 It's not clear if anyone was in that cruiser, a truck full of police in riot gear chased everyone off, didn't see if anyone got out of the cruiser at that time. The images are reminiscent of LA in 1992. 




 The Bowery Boys (who focus on NYC history) tweeted it last night. They live tweet during Mad Men, Turn, The Knick, and probably during Public Morals when it airs latter this year.

 Oh, I have, several people like that - none of them grew up in Houston, or even a top 10 sized city. 




 To me all of Houston is "Real Houston." That being said, I'm amused by how people who were not born in or grew up in Houston act like anything outside of 610 is a no man's land. 




 I know earlier this year there were some guys robbing women in their driveways - snatching purses as the women were getting out of their cars. Not sure if that is still going on. 




 When I go to this location, I tend to go real early in the morning, less of a crowd. Never been stalked there though. 




 I didn't know there was still a WalMart there.

 Agreed. 




 Probably a combo of both, that character has always been awkward.

 State Jail Felony to kill a cat (even a feral cat). 




 Sounds like it was not a feral cat, belonged to a family that lived in that area. 




 Can't believe this bs still happens at Baylor. I know it isn't as bad as the decades before I was at Baylor, but still annoys me. Back in the 1990s, my girlfriend was at UT and I typically drove down to Austin every weekend and would crash in her room at Jester. It was a coed floor, so no big deal there. By 2nd year at Baylor I was living at The Centre and various girlfriends of myself and my roommates were always staying over - some practically seemed to live there for periods. We never gave a f about the moral rules or what ever Baylor Admin calls them. 




 My policy is to use the article's actual title (or at least the suggest title button) whenever possible.  That being said, it is important for everyone to recognize that the headline, or article title, is typically (and historically) written by a copywriter and not the author of the actual article. Considering how newspapers have historically written headlines so as to grab a reader's attention and get the reader to read the article, I feel there has been a little too much handwringing on the internet over "click-bait" lately. 




 Cause dogs are part of the family. 




 Alief 




 I'm shocked my power stayed on, had a few flickers, but stayed on. 




 I saw a post on Facebook stating that the cat was actually the pet of a women who used the Clinic the killer worked at, but no source was sited, so not sure how accurate that information is. 




 This seems like it would be a major headache for retailers in general and cashiers in particular. 




 Here's a short article about that plane: http://www.click2houston.com/news/small-plane-crashlands-on-highway-59-near-diboll/32420348

 Considering how many people have indoor/outdoor and outdoor only cats, how would one truly know if the cat is feral or not (and whether the cat is fixed or not)? 




 Ha ha ha. Mine are indoor only, so I don't have trouble with them bringing bugs in from outside, thankfully. 




 Thankfully all three of mine go after any bugs that move. 




 Cats. 




 Seems to me that it would be more difficult to pee in the sink (unless your sink is unnaturally low) than in the toilet. 




 Ha ha ha . . . oh, wait, she's serious . . .

 I used to think I was allergic to cats, either I was wrong or my body's reaction to cats has changed. 




 Glad it worked out and that they're all getting along.

 I haven't heard anything, I know some people who've held an executive position in the government, like mayor, don't like nonexecutive elected positions (house, senate, etc.) because they're used to being "in charge," rather than being one vote among many. But then again, Cory Booker, former Mayor of Newark, seems to like being in the US Senate. 




 Looks like that's what they did when he reached back into the car. Thankfully the guy in the Explorer wasn't hit, you can see him get out of his care after the suspect was down. The white car that the suspect hit first was driven by a girl who was on her way home from high school. She suffered a concussion, but no other serious injuries. 




 [Here's video of the ending of the chase, including the shooting.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE-codzpjmw) 




 If it is just property damage, and you have comprehensive, make the claim on your insurance and let them go after the other driver's insurance company for repayment. Ain't much for lawyers to win in a property damage case if it ends up becoming a court proceeding, just their billables (or regular salary if they are a "captured firm") from the insurance companies. 




 Condolences.

 The basic kolache is [a sausage cooked inside a pastry](http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/22592/file-13438653-jpg/images/kolache_catering_dallas.jpg).

The [Kolache Factory](http://www.kolachefactory.com/) is one of the big kolache chains here in Houston.

 That's a good question. I assume there is a cost aspect (cost of purchase and cost of maintenance) combined with how the vehicle is going to be used. I assume that a Fusion is cheaper than the Ford Police Interceptor/Chevy Caprice PPV/Dodge Charger and in midtown they really don't need a lot of patrol cars with big engines. As for nontraditional cars, I did see a NYPD Chevrolet Volt, but was not able to get a picture of it.

 I think Humble might use them too, but I'm not 100% sure about that. 




 MILFS in need of comfort? 




 Sounds about right. 




 I haven't seen anything to indicate that Harris County uses red light cameras. There are a lot of traffic cameras around town, those are usually mounted on the stoplight bar. Red light cameras typically seem to be installed on the medians at intersections. 




 And because of this database I find it annoying that I have to send in a copy of proof of insurance when I do my registration. 




 They have been banned in the City of Houston, but not across the State of Texas. Many other municipalities in Texas, including Sugar Land (and probably other suburbs of Houston), use red light cameras.

 I agree, a 100ft buffer is too much of a buffer to set as red letter law. 




 Don't blame OP, that title is from the HuffPost. And, to be honest, headlines are designed to get you to read the story (and are rarely written by the author of the story). Not in agreement that the term clickbait applies here, this isn't a slideshow or fluff piece. 




 The title is a bit misleading. Filming the police is protected by the First Amendment, States cannot legislate around the First Amendment. However, courts do maintain that those filming the police cannot interfere with the police, leaving open what exactly is interfering with police. It appears that this bill is attempting to do that by setting a 100 foot distance requirement. That being said, I think 100 feet is a bit much and I do not support this bill. 




 The other day I say a couple do this during rush hour even though they were only 5 feet away from an actual crosswalk, what morons. Even if you cross against the light in a crosswalk, at least you are in an area where motorists should be aware of you. 




 I would so watch that. 
























 NPR interviewed Jules Feiffer yesterday and he said the following: 

"Well, I've had endless acts because I ran out of steam on one thing, because life happened on another thing, and I developed a resourcefulness ... where I would just look around for some other way to do what I wanted to do. If it happens too fast, you don't build these, what I used to call these "rejection deltoids," where you are so used to being hit in the face that you just get up again automatically. The kids who were successful in high school from the beginning didn't know how to do that. So they would take a couple of slaps and they'd go into their father's business."

We all need to learn to cope when life slaps us around. 




 I'm annoyed by trigger warnings, spoiler alerts, helicopter parenting, etc. but I take issue with blaming all of this on the left. I think this has more to do with changes in parenting technique than politics. 




 Same here. 




 That is some seriously ugly camo. 




 Actually, to get plates and registration he has to go to the county tax office. Bigger counties do have some satellite offices so don't have to go downtown, but the ones here in Harris County still are slow and crowded.

 Just the yelling names aspect, combined with the Middle East conversation above it just triggered my memory of that tweet. 




 You reminded me of this old tweet https://mobile.twitter.com/lsal92/status/247763296541896705

 I tip my hat to you sir or madam as the case might be. 




 Have to admit, rather shocked how sad I am that this show ends tonight. 




 Was on Saturday morning, have to admit that Signal 30 is one of my favorite Mad Men episodes. So much packed into that episode. Also, for some reason, I really like TV episodes directed by actors. Slattery kept that episode tight. As an aside recommend the "Walter Taffet" episode of The Americans, superbly directed by Noah Emmerich.

 I remember [The Eyes of Texas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKmtby53fT4) from when I was a kid. 




 I used to love browsing in that Bookstop, and of course visiting Whole Earth and Cactus while I was over there. Used to be one of the great little classic shopping strips in Houston. 




 Looks like it's 15 minutes longer. 




 Don does not have a great history with motels. 




 That drummer is so bored. 




 Then he's going to pawn it in Vegas. 




 Looks like Don was watching Redd Foxx making an appearance on The Flip Wilson Show http://youtu.be/lm6fLKz5ByU 




 Not the kind of pool I expected. 




 MW hates us. 




 I'm very disappointed  




 I'm very disappointed. 




 It did. It was kind of one of the first CDs to get away from the plastic H form. 




 I actually love Barry's Pizza. My family has been going there since it was Eddie's Pizza located on Richmond   Sage where the Chipotle is now. 




 I heard this song at a recital when I was at Baylor back in the early 1990s, it immediately made me a fan of Hovhaness. 




 There are at least 5 in that picture. Not 100% sure what happened, but I got the impression it was an assault on an officer incident. 




 Dude . . .  




 Totally understandable - I kept the cats when I got divorced, was helpful that she defaulted and never filed an answer to my petition for divorce - so I pretty much got anything I wanted. 




 Ouch 




 Whenever I have had a family member do that, they usually have a babysitter available at or near the wedding location. Not an issue for me, but is helpful for lots of the other cousins who do have kids. 




 That's an acceptable question in Mississippi. 




 Just wanted to say I really enjoy the show. As someone who has always had an interest in the history of Colonial America and the Revolution it's been frustrating how little play the Revolution has had in popular culture. I know at one point, there were more movies about the French and Indian War than about the Revolution - I guess the turn (no pun intended) came with Mel Gibson's Patriot. Now, in the Fall I have Sleepy Hollow and it's fun with the Revolution and then in the Spring I get the more serious, but still entertaining, Turn. 




 I hate Simcoe, but I love his scenes in the show. 




 Contact your local legal aid office, there is a slight possibility that what your parents did might technically be an illegal eviction. Even if that is not the case, legally you should be able to retrieve your property (not allowing you to do so might constitute illegal conversion of your property). 




 I took the Wisconsin bar exam and practiced law there for 4 years before moving back to Texas and taking the bar here. Biggest takeaway is how useless the bar exam is and how it's made more difficult just cause of a pissing war with BarBri. 




 Sure you do Daesh, sure you do. 




 Just another Spring day up in Montgomery County. 




 Hopefully the Sheriff's Department can track down the driver of the other vehicle, that way, even if you have to go through your insurance company to get your vehicle fixed, your insurance company will go after her insurance and will refund your deductible. 




 Orthopedic surgeons = doctors with Craftsman tools. 




 And that will probably increase the more we get to know McCann people. 




 That only works for politicians in South Dakota. 




 Worth listening to also, if just to hear Willie talk. 




 I remember all the Lite commercials featuring retired athletes from when I was a kid. And this storyline is another reason for Miller to keep using the throwback cans and labels for Lite. 




 Good point. 




 That scene was great, so trippy. 




 I'm having trouble believing that Daesh had any knowledge of this incident till they heard/read about it in the news. 




 I'm going to venture a guess that Daesh is taking advantage of the incident after the fact, I doubt it had any prior knowledge. 




 A couple Tuesdays back I didn't have any project to work on at the office and the weather was great, so, after hitting a bit of the MFAH, I figured I'd go to the Zoo. The parking lot was a cluster and it wasn't even 11:00 am yet. 




 Lebanon, on the whole, has always been a bit different from the rest of the Middle East. 




 Condolences. 




 You mean "escort" activity, nudge nudge, wink wink. 




 The fact that Howard wants, needs a limo just highlights the depth of his insecurities. Most people in NYC in Howard's tax bracket do not use limos, instead they get driven around in high end sedans and SUVs. But does Howard want a really nice Mercedes? No, he needs to have a limo. 




 Thanks, I'll check it out. 




 Sigh 




 More like: Crazy people meet crazy people. 




 The other week I was down by the police parking lots off of Washington and noticed a couple black ghost vehicles. 




 Not sure why this is posted here, but it is a good song.

 So Cooper was into anime before it was cool. 




 In fairness, Betty thinks all other women (and most other people) are morons.

 I will say this about Pete, when it comes to work, he's extremely loyal to Don, Peggy, and Joan.

 I tend to find "On Being" rather hit or miss, but this weekend's episode was really interesting. Since it tends to air early on most stations, I figured I'd post a link here. 




 Based on the picture, that does appear to be a valid European Union license plate issued in Germany (The D stands for Deutschland). Odd are, the owner is in the military and was stationed in Germany, bought it there, and had it shipped back to the US when transferred.

 It's a Texas thing. If I had to explain, you wouldn't understand.

 Abbott is in a hurry to show the world he's more of a nutwing than Perry was - at least I've never voted for either of those weirdos. 




 So glad that they are rebooting X-Files, came out when I was in college, so good memories. 




 I was thinking of this http://bizbeatblog.dallasnews.com/2015/04/health-inspectors-found-crickets-mildew-at-blue-bell-plant-report.html/ 




 Damn, that brings back memories, was in high school at the time and this incident was highlighted as a warning story at spring break time for several subsequent years. 




 I'm glad they aren't laying anyone off, but maybe they should considering whatever managers failed to maintain proper sanitary conditions in the plants. 




 Agree, when it returns to the shelves it will sell like hotcakes. 




 Well, it is a documentary produced by and for Netflix, which, in this era, is television. 




 Is crack really still a common thing? Has the term "crackhead" become a catchall phrase to describe someone who is freaking out on drugs (or freaking out because they are crazy and aren't on their meds)? 




 Obviously, games that take place during the work week (before school is out) will have smaller attendance giving you more chance to upgrade.

Sounds like 290 at Eldridge will be a construction cluster all weekend too. 




 Parking scams during events seem to be a thing lately. I've heard several parking scams stories related on sports radio from people who were going to Rockets/Astros games.

 Honestly, my recommendation is, if at all possible, cookout at home, pull the grill out and throw some meat on it. The three worst days of the year to eat out are NYE, Valentine's Day, and Mother's Day. 




 Just seeing the picture of those people on those manuals brings back so many memories. 




 Have you contacted any museums or historical societies in the area? Or possibly contact the [New Jersey Historical Society] (http://www.jerseyhistory.org/), they might be willing to take it, and handling the transport etc. 




 Too often when I hear gunshoots in my area of Alief, I have no idea where they are coming from. Sunday morning I heard what sounded like gunshots while walking on my own street. All I could tell was they came from the north of my location. As to what street, block, etc. . . no idea.

 I love Stand By Me, but I really love Spanish Harlem - I can close my eyes while listening to that song and be transported to 1960s New York City.

 One Christmas, my Uncle and his family came to visit and he brought his new Intellivision with them. My parents had already purchased the Atari to be a family Christmas gift, but once they saw the graphics of the Intellivision, they returned the Atari and bout the Sears branded Intellivision. Great decision, loved playing that thing as a kid. 




 While doing research for his novel Lush Life, Richard Price did a ride along in one of these NYPD taxis in the LES and talked about it for The Moth: http://youtu.be/S6LCSGv1gA4 




 The only vehicles that NYC resident pedestrians ever seem to yield to are fire trucks and ambulances. 




 It's a penthouse in Gramercy Park, that's the basis for the bulk of that price. And the NYC real estate market is insane thanks to foreign investors. 




 I saw the same in Italy, and not just marked cars. 
























 That's what it looked like to me.

 This RadioLab podcast takes a look at how the US has treated foreign prisoners of war and the controversy caused by that treatment, especially in light of the treatment of US citizens in internment camps and the treatment of US prisoners of war by enemy powers.

 Whenever police are reluctant about removing a seemingly abandoned car, my first thought is: "Bait car?" Probably not in this case. 












































 This sting has more to do with marketing related bribes and kickbacks involving CONCACAF officials and marketing companies, such as Traffic. Much of this seems to be connected to tv and radio rights for matches and tournaments, including the 2014 World Cup.

Since CONCACAF is headquartered in Miami, the US has jurisdiction. It is not uncommon for the law enforcement authorities of different countries to work together. The fact that the Swiss authorities were willing to assist the US indicates just how fed up they are with FIFA in general.

As to why now - my understanding is that certain statutes of limitations were on the verge of expiring.

FIFA doesn't like governmental interference into its secret lairs. I've seen speculation that if Blatter wanted, he could suspend all of CONCACAF and take away the World Cup slots. Not sure how accurate this is, and not sure that FIFA would want to grab the bull by the horns like that.

I think DOJ's endgame is to root out corruption in CONCACAF and hold the sleazy folks that have been in charge accountable for their misdeeds.

What happened today isn't about the 2018   2022 World Cup bidding processes; however, the Swiss government has launched its own criminal proceedings into those matters. 
































































 Haven't seen any dead birds in my area yet, but during my run this morning I did see a dead cat that looked like it got caught in the flooding. 









 As noted by others, the US investigation concerns CONCACAF. [Meanwhile, the Swiss authorities have opened an investigation into the 2018 and 2022 World Cup Bids.](http://news.yahoo.com/swiss-police-detain-soccer-officials-ahead-fifa-congress-053453976--spt.html) 
























 Which is a reminder of why it's not a good idea to drive into high water, doesn't take much to make a car float. 


































 Yep, the floodwaters brought it to the surface and floated it over to a bike path along a bayou. 


































 The afternoon of September 11th and the day everyone left because of Hurricane Rita are the two weekdays I saw Downtown that dead. 














 Had water get up into the garage, but stayed below the sheet rock. 









 A lot of traffic lights are blinking red, which doesn't make things any easier. 









 Thank you! 




 Wishing I could watch tonight, but raging storms here in Houston killed my electricity. 



















 Canadian Thugs ;-) 




 The average driver is not going to have any idea what that car is, it doesn't stand out the way Crown Vics stand out, it actually kind of blends in somewhere between the old Impalas and Malibus.

 I recommend the movie "Crossing the Bridge," which makes good use of this song.

 No cowboy hat. I have boots: motorcycle boots and tactical boots.

 Surprised that Charlie Leduff's Detroit: An American Autopsy was not on that list. 




 If I could predict the future like that, well, I'd be a rich man. Look, revisit the issue down the road, after the situation has settled down, after that asshole Putin is gone. 




 Well played, I applaud you. 




 East End area is on the rise. 




 In reality, the issue should be revisited down the road, after Putin is gone. But right now, doing this would be a spineless capitulation by UEFA to appease a thug and bully. But hey, the governing boards of FIFA, UEFA, CONCACAF, etc. do consist of a bunch of immoral bastards looking to line their own pockets. 




 Sadly, here in Texas the criminal justice system excels at criminalizing poverty. 




 The people who live in Crimea. 




 This happens all the time. Police and DA's office won't waste their time on you once you explain the situation. 




 Makes me miss The Axiom. 




 Well, they should of thought about that before jumping into bed with Putin. 




 And the problem with that is? 




 When did it have balls? 




 It's actually his tan that got me to think WTF, seems dangerous. 




 Tan Mom would be jealous. 




 If you have taken more than three consecutive sips of beer while standing, you've broken a law in Texas. When I was at Baylor a student got a ticket for farting. That's the light hearted side, the dark side is how many people get ticketed or arrested on flimsy evidence that wouldn't hold up at trial but can't hire good legal help so take pleas cause it seems easier   quicker than fighting,   then find themselves f'd financially. "Just don't break the law," is pure navet. Oh, how about this poor guy - http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article1957716.html

 I love it. Big diverse city, great museums, 5 pro sports teams, great performing arts, great food, lots of nightlife. Traffic can be hell. It's humid as hell. Summer is hot but not as hot as Austin (which has worse traffic   does get very humid). Visit /r/Houston 




 It sounds like it's Fox that is the issue. They signed a contract and now want to a new one that pays them more.

 Back in the mid-90s there was one older Capitol Police guy that seemed to spend all day around a street corner near the Library of Congress yelling at jaywalkers. Not issuing tickets, just yelling at them to wait for their light.

 I don't think it's really going to have a huge impact here in Houston, big trucks have been coming up 59 from Laredo for decades now, it'll just cut their travel time Laredo up to Houston. This past December I drove up to Marshall for a wedding, hadn't driven up 59 through East Texas in almost 10 years, damn what a much improved drive that is now. 




 Now I'm hungry for tripe Pho, thankfully I live in Houston where Pho is a staple.

 He wasn't a murdering asshole and he wasn't a saint. I respect that he made an effort to help his fellow veterans who were suffering PTSD, something Congress (or the Texas legislature) seems to have no interest in doing. 




 The Interstate 69 signs here in Houston have seemed to last, wonder if they've found a way to make it harder to steal those signs. 




 This isn't just a problem in the realm of truancy, it is a problem for a lot of low income people who get cited for various minor "quality of life" misdemeanors - loitering, public intoxication, being in a park after it has closed, etc. They get caught in a vicious circle of missing work due to arrest and court, already living paycheck to paycheck so can't pay fine, more court, maybe more jail, more work missed, there goes the job, etc. etc. etc. One of the big reasons that the federal judge shot down "stop and frisk" in the NYC public housing scenario was partly due to this happening to people who had no weapon and ended up getting summonses related to "quality of life" issues. The lead plaintiff in that case was arrested for trespassing at a public housing unit - he was waiting for his girlfriend who lived there and gave him permission to be there. The guy is a licensed security guard and the flimsy arrest, even without a conviction, could have seriously ruined his career. 




 I thought I read that only one of the dead was a Bandido, the other eight were Cossacks. Also, the impression I've gotten is that biker gangs will talk tough when it comes to the police, but in reality try to avoid violence against the police cause doing so will rain hell down upon them. MCs have clubhouses, clubhouses that are not well hidden.

 Yes, Uverse has Fox Sports 1; however, [there is a dispute between the two entities concerning carriage fees as related to NASCAR, soccer, and golf.](http://variety.com/2015/tv/news/fox-sports-1-att-in-dispute-over-fees-for-nascar-golf-soccer-1201443261/) 




 I think they were more sophisticated than that. There were several of these incidents in my neighborhood at the time, indicative of organized burglary and probably answered to someone higher up the chain who already has a fence. 




 A few years back when my house got robbed, a dog in the backyard did not prevent them from jumping the fence and kicking down the backdoor. And she wasn't a small dog, sadly she was super friendly. When I had a new door installed, they guy installed it in such a way that it will be extremely difficult to kick in. 




 I did that when I was robbed. Never heard from HPD again after the initial report. 




 You forgot to ad - Get Renters Insurance if you rent. 




 That might actually be a fun conversation to eavesdrop on. 




 The only professional league in the US that does this is Major League Soccer, since it's the only league with organized Supporter Groups (often called in Ultras in other countries).

 [This is my favorite one that happened in Houston.](http://www.fbi.gov/houston/press-releases/2013/woodlands-man-convicted-of-using-fake-cia-credentials)
I will say one thing that can be annoying here in Houston is how all the private security companies now have fleets of cars that look like police cars. Additionally, there are at least three communities (two very wealthy neighborhoods and one a commercial district) that hire off-duty LEO to patrol in vehicles those communities have furnished - and they seem to replace the cars more often than HPD. 




 I have seen Houston Police use pick-up trucks, but were always marked, and the decals indicated that their primary duty was related to dealing with Tractor-Trailer enforcement. 




 One of the reasons I hated the idea of the Astros moving to the American League, might not always beat the Cardinals, but we did get to beat them at least a few times every season. 




 Not all government vehicles in Texas say "EXEMPT" on their plates, I've seen marked Constable vehicles with normal Texas plates. Pursuant to Texas Transportation Code 721.003 it is possible to obtain regular plates for exempt vehicles. While said section lists a bunch of specific entities, I assume that No. 18 is a pretty broad coverall for all other agencies. 




 Plus the way I heard it on the news this morning, he was found in a city owned vehicle. 




 Totally forget that I had that Space Invader game when I was a kid. I also had the football game that Henry was playing on The Americans this past season. 




 Sadly, it's getting harder and harder. A lot of unmarked vehicles will have officers with armor and polos or t-shirts, but it's easy for civilians to buy that stuff too. Hell, lots of police departments, especially in tourist areas, sell the t-shirts. I know the NOPD precinct office in the French Quarter has a t-shirt vending machine. 




 I'm thinking more nefarious than that, sexual assault. 




 I believe that those episodes in the 500s are repeats, which won't necessarily be replayed in order.

 I thought it was too. 





































































 West U. and Bellaire are each municipalities with their own police departments. Also, The Villages in the Memorial area has a police department. All three will pull you over for the most minor infractions possible. 




 When I was in school, the only times we ever did any kind of field trip that involved swimming was going to the school district's indoor swimming pool. Never went to the beach on a field trip.

 Breakfast Taquitos are my sin. There's a Whataburger on my way to work, I like to pick some up for breakfast and then I have a stash of [El Yucateco hot sauce](http://www.elyucateco.com) in my office. 














 Knock on wood, so far I've avoided being arrested in Texas for drinking more than 3 sips of beer while standing. 




 And then he became Little Finger. 





























 The only reason I really know of him is thanks to the character in The Wire that was loosely based on him. 




 FIFA isn't involved in the Olympics bid process, the entity in charge of the Olympics is the IOC. That being said, the IOC is far from squeaky clean. In particular, former IOC President (1980-2001) Juan Antonio Samaranch, was a member of the Franco regime in Spain. The IOC doesn't get as much attention as FIFA because, even though the World Cup finals is every four years, FIFA plays a much bigger role in the operation of soccer than the IOC does in the variety of sports that make up the Olympics.

Q: Do officers of the METRO Police Department have the same authority as Houston Police Department officers? 
A: Yes, the METRO Police Officers have the same law enforcement authority as other licensed peace officers in the State of Texas, including Houston Police Department officers.

Q: What is the jurisdiction of the METRO Police Department?
A: The jurisdiction of the METRO Police Department is defined as any part of the county in which the 1 cent METRO sales tax is collected. This area spans approximately 1,285 square-miles, which includes most of Harris County and portions of Montgomery, Fort Bend, and Waller Counties. The METRO service area crosses several political jurisdictions and METRO Police has concurrent jurisdiction with those police agencies. However, the METRO Police Department is the primary police agency whenever an incident occurs on METRO property, such as bus stops/shelters, METRORail platforms, Park   Ride lots, transit centers, buses, and light rail vehicles. METRO Police also has primary jurisdiction of the High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) network, as well as other right-of-ways or locations where transit-related incidents occur.

Q: What types of crime does the MPD investigate?
A: MPD investigates all crime occurring on METRO property or right-of-ways (see above). METRO Police also act on information received from Crime Stoppers and individuals who report criminal activity observed on METRO property or right-of-ways.

 Uptown, River Oaks, Tanglewood, and Westchase all tend to be off-duty Police Officers, most that I've seen are off-duty HPD. 





































































 I think they used the age of 21 because, under federal law, licensed gun dealers cannot sell handguns to anyone under the age of 21. (Unlicensed gun sellers cannot sell a handgun to anyone under age of 18). 



















 Great, thanks! 




 Looks like they did an updated one - https://www.facebook.com/253123334768421/photos/a.253140671433354.61356.253123334768421/859079740839441/?type=1 permPage=1

EDIT: Looks like the earlier link had the wrong picture.
 









 According to the article, the lawsuit has been filed. They may have filed suit for tactical reasons, i.e. scaring the landowner into taking their offer; but, the landowner in this situation is retired attorney who spent his career working for the rights of Indian tribes and members of Indian tribes, not gonna scare easy and has plenty of time on his hands. I'm curious to watch how this plays out. 




 I'm not familiar enough to know how that might work under North Dakota law. I do get the sense that eminent domain is essentially a "King's X" and has a superior right to all other land rights, subject to compensation. 














 I would think a reporter would really have to go out of their way to find Paula Jones these days, guess it's a slow political news day. 




 First rule of the military - never volunteer for anything. Of course, since there is no draft, anyone in the military has already broken that rule. 




 You should be able to afford it monetarily and you should be able to afford the time necessary to take care of the pet.

 Beyond the headline, this article actually does a nice little job of highlighting just how easy it is to get arrested, and have an outstanding warrant, in New York City thanks to the concept of "Broken Windows" policing. 









 Actually, even if they lose the lawsuit, they won't actually lose their land. A ruling against them will mean that an easement will be granted for the pipeline and the landowner will still have to be compensated, but that amount will be determined by the court - an amount that will likely be less than what has been offered already. 









 As someone who lives in Houston, Texas, it really pissed me off when Texas Republicans didn't want to support federal relief in the wake of Super Storm Sandy. First of all, I know I live in an area that can get ravaged by weather and federal relief is important in our recovery from those incidents. Second, just cause I am a Texan doesn't make me an island unto myself - not only do I have a lot of family and friends who live in the areas hit by Sandy, but as an American I don't like seeing other Americans suffering as a result of natural disasters and I don't like seeing a-hole politicians play politics while other Americans are suffering. 





























 A little bit of background on the landowner, James Botsford, he's a retired attorney who spent most of his career as the Director of the Indian Law Office of Wisconsin Judicare, a legal aid law firm. He was also instrumental in the drafting and passage of the federal law that protects the use of peyote by members of the Native American Church. 














 Probably Mario Williams, he's the one that bought the Camaros for HPD.
