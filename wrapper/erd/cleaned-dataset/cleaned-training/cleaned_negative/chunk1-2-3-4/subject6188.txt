 I've got a *friend* who's been living off-island for pretty much the past ten years. Sure, he's popped back from time to time, every now and then, but as we all know, playing the tourist and actually living in Hawaii are two different things.

Life being what it is, my *friend* will be moving back to Oahu (not 100% official, but he's 80% of the way there, he's paddling his ass off and can see the Islands on the horizon!) and he'd like to know:

"If you left Hawaii in say, 2005, and came back today, what do you thing has changed the most about life in Hawaii?" 








































































































 Hoo said that?! 




 You crack me up.... 




 Size doesn't matter! 




 Do fries come with that shake?! 




  Perhaps insufficient support over the years?

Not very uplifting is it?! 




  Strange how they both face in different directions though

Better let me give you a hand...or two:~) 
























 Hey there /u/autowikibot! You subscribe to /r/train_subject6188 too?!

We're big time ladies and gentlemen! 




 What is [Ultra Seven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_Seven) you say?

"Ultra Seven ( Urutora Sebun) is a tokusatsu science fiction TV series that aired on Japanese TV in 1967. Created by Eiji Tsuburaya, this follow up to Ultraman went on to become one of Japan's greatest fantasy TV series. Such is his popularity that Ultra Seven (or simply "Seven") has appeared or at least made cameos in nearly every Ultra Series following his own and has had far more exposure than even the original Ultraman (though the original Ultraman is without a doubt the face of the Ultras).
Ultra Seven is sometimes incorrectly called "Ultraman Seven" by many sources outside Japan (or in the case of KHON/Honolulu, Hawaii, Ultra 7, as listed in TV Guide when it ran in 1975). Both the series and its hero can also be called Ultraseven (without a space), which is generally the form used when romanized." 









 What is Tanabata?

"Tanabata is a Japanese festival originating from the Chinese Qixi Festival. It celebrates the meeting of the deities Orihime and Hikoboshi (represented by the stars Vega and Altair respectively). According to legend, the Milky Way separates these lovers, and they are allowed to meet only once a year on the seventh day of the seventh lunar month of the lunisolar calendar."

It's not a national holiday, so people still have to work and it's more popular with the kids, but many places have festivals and that means food, beer and games. 


































  A virgin

We approve of virgins! 




 Life's a beach, so I'll meet you at the sandbar:~)

*-gives a little wave-* 




   I'm happy to help with any ideas you have.

Seriously, it looks great and I'm stoked.

If anything comes to me, I'll let you know, but to be perfectly honest, so far, so good! 

















































 I agree! Thanks to our CSS Wiz, /u/Handicapreader, /r/train_subject6188 is now the fastest growing sub on Reddit!^not^really... 




 Me too! In bed at 10pm tonight! 

Night all... 









 Tell me about it.

One of them stuck a "Kick Me!" sign on my back earlier today:~( 




 Thank goodness! 




 Got it. Now I've got to find Hazel...sorry, who am I looking for again? 



















 K

I'll ask for free refills too! 



















 I shouldn't be allowed near a keyboard when hungover... 




 Not the brightest bulb in the deck, am I? 














 Indeed. I think the first few goals kind of blew their minds. 




 Japan's coach is already talking about the Olympics. Guess they start qualifiers in Feb? 









 I didn't see any of it live, but I've seen enough now... 




 See? I'm always a day late and a dollar short... 














 Man, I'm watching the highlights on the news and the US women were just on target. 




 It all makes sense now!^not^really 




 Probably, but I've been beat all day today... 




  Mods are ruining reddit!!

You were paid to say that, weren't you!? 




 Juuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuust a bit hungover.

Don't know why I drank on a Sunday...back on the wagon again! 




 I'm green with envy:~) 




 Ban me!!!! 




 Yes:~) 




 There's nothing there!

Are you feeling alright? Feverish?

Shall I ~~play~~ call a doctor?! 




 Um? 

What-chu talking 'bout, Carma!? 




 Sorry, I couldn't resist! 




 If I suddenly go missing, it means they've locked me in the cellar! 




 It's true, it's blue! 




 "...warns Asian countries could see Australia as 'decadent' if same-sex marriage legalised"

Tentacle porn, soaplands, bj bars, pachinko, hostess/host clubs, cosplay clubs....

He's not including Japan in his statement by any chance, is he? 




 So....

...

...

...any recommendations for a good place to stay? 














  As a Japanese living in Chicago

Tokyo winters are like summer compared to Chicago! 




 Due to the fact that /r/train_subject6188 is now the fastest growing sub ~~in my mind~~ on Reddit, we've had to take on two new moderators in /r/Handicapreader and /u/Carmabound.

Mr. Reader has created the sky above and below us, because, well, I was drunk and/or hungover every day in high school and wasn't paying attention to my teacher in computer class. All things CSS will go through him and only him. He deserves all the credit for everything you see.

Ms. Bound will be in charge of....in charge of....well, she'll be doing the same thing I do, and that's nothing but making witty comments and having lots of pun.

I'm sure after a few months, the crew will stage a mutiny and boot me off my own sub, but lets enjoy it while it lasts, ok?

 




 Let's do it!!!!! 




   he said I would do great as a comedian.

Go for it! Can I be your ghost writer?! 




  I showed this to my friend who works for the county

Can he/she get me a job watering flowers in Waikiki?

Maybe I'm missing something, but I used to see the truck going down Kalakaua every morning and always thought, man, what a great job.
 




 Good gravy, my hangover is really showing in my comments today! 




  If all else fails, my offer to be a comedy duo still stands... and I might even have an agent.
 
At this point in my life, I'll try anything!

 Did I tell you about that?

Go on...
 




  and you're a twit

Thank you. I love you too.
 




 It's such an awesome team, Kane, Toews, Sharp(will he stay?), Keith, Shaw, Seabrook, Hossa and so on...

I was real saad to see Saad leave, but that's just the economics these days.

That said,the best move that Rocky made was pinching the Bowman's from Detroit. 




  it would be great if you could find a writing gig.

It would, but have you read my comment history?!

 




  As a Canadian

As a native Chicagoan, may I thank you for stocking my Blackhawks with your fine countrymen and bringing the Cup to Chicago three times! 




 Ah, sorry, you're right. 2014 was in Brazil, I was confused with the Olympics. 




  That's great :)

It is and it isn't. You know me, I'm such a worry-wart that I'm wondering what will go wrong, instead of enjoying it for what it is.

 Do you already have a place to stay

Yes, I'm just waiting for the realtor to confirm the exact move in date before I buy a ticket. I know it's a holiday weekend and all, but they're kinda laid back when it comes to all things business in HI.

 and a possible job lined up

No. Will have to get on this, but I went through this before when I went from Japan to Hawaii. People don't really want to talk to you unless you're there. Maybe because so many people change their minds at the last minute, but it's next to impossible to set something up via phone/internet.

 Do you have a laptop, or are you going to disconnect again?

I do, but I'm not sure what they have there. I may be offline for a week or so, but I'll try to set something up before I go, when the actual move in date is set for sure.

 




 As an American living in Tokyo, I'm just happy that I don't have to hear the locals gloat for the next four years.

Team Japan is pretty darn good though, and they do work really hard. It's just that the media coverage here is enough to drive anyone mad, unless of course your a fan of the team.

That said, ~~Brazil~~ Russia is only 2 years away, so I'm sure from tomorrow we'll be seeing how the men's Cup will coming to JP for sure!

**EDIT: Thanks to /u/tokomini for pointed out my brainfart. The Olympics will be held in Brazil in 2016, the WC was held there in 2014.** 




 Carma, it's looking pretty good at the moment.

I've got to check back in with the doc next Mon, but other than buying a plane ticket and doing some last minute shopping, I'm pretty much 99.9% sure I'll be off next month.

Strangely enough, right around my cakeday again!

Unless the doc tells me that my body is seriously fucked, it's looking like I'll be basking in the sun soon enough:~) 




 Just want to say thanks to you and all the Mods here for doing such a great job.

That's all. 




 At least I don't have to hear the locals talking about how great Team JP is for the next four....aw shit, 2016 Brazil?!  









 I didn't watch it, was Germany hungover? 




 Well, England did finish 3rd, so it's not all that bad, right?

Do you like how I pitched that? 




 I've always liked him and felt real bad for him after that WS flub. That was just shit luck and a brain fart on his part, but he's always been a hard worker and good player. 




  I thought they just took a map of the island and threw wet spaghetti in the air. Wherever it landed, that's where they put the roads.

Same crew must've done the roads here, 'cause that's pretty much how Tokyo is too:~( 




























































































































 Ew! 

Stop stickying us! 




 May I join in on the confusion?! 




 How *you* doin!? 




 [Yes indeed!](http://www.jma.go.jp/en/typh/) 




 Thank yov and in three and a half houqs, it'll be Friday! 




 Happy Thursday to you!

Happy Thursday to you!

Happy Thursday dear fans of /r/train_subject6188...

Happy Thursday to you! 




















































































 It's really awesome, but highly dark and disturbing. 
























 You and I both!

 I haven't watched it straight through from Season 1, because I didn't catch on in time, but man, what a great show.

Strangely enough, it's on DLife here in Tokyo, and D means Disney.

Anyways, I digress, I really like the stories on an individual basis, but there's an ongoing arc involving the Aaron Hotchner character and boy....

I'm not going to go into any details, because spoilers for anyone who hasn't watched it but would like to, but I'm into Season 5.

Wow. 












































 Thanks for making me lose three hours of my life...just...staring... 
























 I think I've been spending way too much time on Reddit recently.

My wife lectured me for about 10 minutes when she suddenly stopped and asked if I was paying attention, to which I replied, "TL;DL!" (too long; didn't listen) 




 Let's just both hope for the best! 




 *hatter wipes away a lone tear*

It's looking like I'll be off right around my cakeday again. My place is confirmed and next is a plane ticket.

Hopefully, I'll get a clean bill of health next week! 




 11 or 18?

Not that I'm stalking you, but you will be missed:~( 




 And that's why we love you!

Hey, by the way, aren't you going on your cruise soon? 




 Lucky lady:~) 














 How *you* doin?! 




















































































 Makes me all warm and fuzzy it does! 




 This is a great move by the Carp and I believe that it'll be the first time in a CL regular season game that this will happen.

 Oh Rob! 







































 As per [this earlier thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Madazzahatter/comments/3ce9vr/its_77_in_japan_and_that_means_its_tanabata_%E4%B8%83%E5%A4%95/) it's Tanabata in Japan! Yay! 









 Went over to Kawaguchi (Saitama) for dinner and it seems as though they're having a Tanabata candle festival going on right now in Nishi-guchi Park! Yay! A little late to promote this, but if I recall, usually 4 or 5 days before Tanabata, they have an street festival on the east side of the station.
