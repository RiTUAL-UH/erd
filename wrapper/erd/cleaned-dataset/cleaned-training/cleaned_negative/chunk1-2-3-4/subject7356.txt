 Hi Reddit,

My boyfriend has been taking Citalopram (celexa) for his depression for a month now but he has admitted that he has no desire to have sex. I asked if I could make him want to and he said 'please don't do that', I asked if he thought we would any time soon and he said he didn't know.

I was wondering if anyone with experience of this could give me some advice on what to do?
We have been together three years so it's not the end of the relationship if we don't have sex for a while, but I already really miss feeling intimate with him like that, and it's upsetting me thinking we might not get that back any time in the foreseeable future. Especially as we're so young. 
Every time anyone mentions sex I get sad. 
He won't want to change his medication as it seems to be working for him so far, and at the moment I don't think sex is very important to him at the moment. 

I would really like some help with how to handle this, what I can do, and how over people have handled a relationship without sex?

 He's only on 20mg so not a very high dose...  
























 I suppose in the future it might be a possible for him to do that, but at the moment I think he's probably better on a slightly higher dose.
I'll mention it to him at some point as an option.. Thankyou!
