 Yes, the Lions were coming off the worst season in NFL history, but he was being offered one of only 32 NFL head coaching jobs in the world. What was he going to do? Say no thanks, I'll wait for the next one.  









 Or anywhere for that matter. You basically have two part-time players instead of a full-time + part-time. 



























































 Here is my 2 cents about last nights disappointment.  

End of the 7th, Scherzer's pitch count was at 108 and he was looking mortal.  
  
Start the 8th with Veras, the unofficial set-up man. Get one out, give up hit bringing up Ellsbury.  
Ellsbury has a marked L/R split, so pull Veras for Smyly whom doesn't deliver.  
  
Since Victorino is only batting righty and Smyly's L/R OPSa is .446/.648 pull him for AlAl.  

With Alburquerque's tendencies I don't like bringing him in with runners on but he K's Victorino.  
Now AlAl gives up a single to Pedroia loading the bases for Big Papi.  
Leyland decides to go with his main reliever Benoit.

This is a bad situational match-up, while Benoit had not allowed Ortiz a xBH in 26 PA (.273 SLG), with the bases loaded you don't go with a guy allowing a .385 OBA to the hitter.  
Especially when you have an Ortiz killer in the bullpen.  
  

Phil Coke has faced Ortiz 20 times with a triple slash of .150/.167/.317  
    
Why would you activate Coke and not use him in the very situation he was made for?
  
Edit: Thank you to /u/wjg10 for the link the breakdown over at [Fangraphs](http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/assigning-responsibility-for-david-ortiz/)  
  
TL;DR It wasn't a fastball down the middle. They call it a splitter (I've seen slider elsewhere) on the outside edge just above the knees. If Benoit missed with the pitch it was not by much.

 I'm sorry, let me simplify my point. 
 i get the bowl ban being lifted since anyone who was involved is no longer w the program   

Nothing, including the bowl ban and scholarships, should have been reinstated because they would discourage future cover ups. 




 The purpose of taking the wins, scholarships, and bowls are not just to punish the guilty but to dissuade future violations. So that next time a head coach, athletic director, or university president hears that one of their employees may be diddling children on their watch they will think it's worse to do nothing.  
If Joe Paterno knew his legacy would be taken from him do you think he would have risked it by letting Jerry hang around?  
If the AD/President knew their program/school would lose the money from bowl games, the competitiveness from scholarships, and the prestige they got from the wins would they have covered it up?  
Take a look at how MLB handled Pete Rose. By banning him from the Hall of Fame and sticking with it you haven't heard of any other coaches betting on their teams because at least partially  it's not worth it.  
Of course now that NCAA pussed out they showed everyone that it's worth covering up something as atrocious as child abuse because the consequences are laughable. 




 WTF! Putting football above all was why those wins were taken in the first place.
