  Forget the tax aspect, and ask a less fortunate freind if they could use a car.If they say Yes, just give it away and you earn some respect in your comunity. If they say no just junk it for weight. Either way you will do better than getting involved with the Gov. or bogus charities. 




 SUHWEEET! 




 Large knife a swiss blade mated to a handlle I whittled from the branch of a chesnut tree. Two hidden pins On the inside are sawed ends of drill bits. Raw hide wraps on the out side.Crack in the handle came from throwing this into the kitchen wall about  1000 times,balace is perfect.
Small knife is an old hacksaw blade worked with a file and the handle whittled from a 100 year old maple that blew down in my yard.One hidden pin sawed from a drill bit and the bolster is cast like an old time knife but with epoxy and coal dust for color. 









 You can use a hand gun against a half dozen crooks with automatic weapons and not think about  picking up the better weapon of the guy you just killed.

 Nothing to cringe at here.He is a sweet animal and well mannered.She takes him traveling with her and her boy friend and he enjoys that.As in most cases, if there is a problem it is the fault of the owner not the animal. 




 Not just the body.He built the frame,suspension and just about everything else 














 He is half German shepard and half arctic wolf. My friend has the pics of his parents and all the documentation on him.She got him from a Specialized breeder. He does not look to humans first,he goes about his buisiness until you get his attention,a definate trait of wolfs.Thanks for the interest he's not mine but he is the most awesome dog I know. 



















 You are the reason I like dogs more than people.

 Just want to add that my dream knife is a Hattori 




 Love my Douk-Douk! 




 Great post,thanks.I'm a chef and love all kinds of knives,At work I've used Dexters,Victorinox,Chicago,ect. for 35 years and I would say these are more than enough for the average person.At home I keep a set of Shuns in a bamboo "shrine" on the wall and only use them for special occasions.My workaday home knives are  kershaw Pure Komachi series.These were made in Japan and are wonderfull light duty blades but don't confuse them with Pure Komachi2 which are Chinese junk.

 Love this! 









 Nieto picnic knife.This is a cool little (about 2" closed) knife.Olive wood scales and AN-58 blades and much decorative work.Fit and finish are not perfect(slight buffer burn on the corner of one scale) but very nice.Build is very tight and solid.Edge needs a bit of stropping to shave hair.Mine came with a very tiny nick in one side of the edge but I think it was just one of those things as the rest of the knife is so tightly built.Not a deal breaker for me.Custom made collector quality? No. Cool little piece of jewelery for about $40 bucks?Oh yeah! 




 Ok,back as promised.From the top down:
Kizlyar U-5:These are hand made in Russia,my #1 favorite.
Helle HE30:This is a work of art,outstanding fit and finish.heavy duty blade is razor sharp,could stand up to hard use.
Lone Wolf U.S.45:Nice utility knife,hand checkered rosewood scales.
CRKT Fulcrum:Nice unusual knife,fun to play with.
SOG Mini Vulan:Love the look of this one,Tight build, solid lock up.
Kershaw double something:Classic pattern with thumb studs and unique single liner lock.
Nieto picnic knife:I like this little piece of jewelery,more on a seperate comment.
Kershaw Scallion:Best pocket knife ever,I use this about 500 times a day.

 As an American: Where are the hookers,crackheads and trigger happy cops? 




 This kind of nonsense really pisses me off. The use of a cutting edge is the single most important development in the history of mankind.
You can survive without fire but you cannot survive without some sort of cutting edge.Every single thing that you eat, wear or use in this world   requires some sort of knife to produce. The first pocket knife used to be a rite of passage for a 10-12 year old boy,now they are taught that knives are scary terrorist weapons  that will not be tolerated.What is the result of this nonsense? I have young nephews that know I like knives and without fail, on some  X-mas or B-day I will recieve a big scary looking mall-ninja piece of shit.I use those to chop weeds out of the yard and shake my head in sadness.

 When I was a kid in the early 70's we thought we were all cool with our CAT knives...they were junk. Turned me off to Mercator for a long Time. Looking back, they were probably  Japan imports which back then were junk. Today,Japan is the same Great Quality as the Made in the USA of yesteryear if not better.Try here http://www.worldknives.com/ I have had good luck with Linder, Nieto, and the French, Swiss and Russian companies. Anything from Seiki Japan is nice. Hope this helps. 




 Great knife for the money,very well made.Carbon steel blade takes a fine edge and is easy to sharpen,has a second detent so the blade will stop at half way closed instead of just snapping shut. Try one out and post your opinion. Thanks for the interest :)

 Another beautifull knife from Helle. Gets my vote! 




 Thanks for the interest everyone. I bought this as a show piece and would not want to ruin that beautifull polish by taking it in the field.I have used it in my kitchen though and it is razor sharp and well balanced.Finger guards? we don't need no steenking finger guards,LOL!

 All these terms are just genaric now and thrown about willy nilly. they don't really mean someone is racist or a bigot or a hater. It's just pop culture.

 It,s already happening here in the US. A few years ago there was a drought and Georgia was theatening to go to war with Tennessee over a shared lake on the border.Meanwhile the Gator-aid plant in Georgia continued to use million of gallons of water every day. It is  illeagal to harvest rain water in Colorado. Ever see a picture of the fabulous fountains in Vegas? A few miles down stream people are starving because what once was a river is now a muddy trickle. Where I live, companies are lobbying for the right to drill for gas by pumping thousands of gallons of chemicals deep into the ground and for up to  a quarter mile or so laterally.In pennsylvania, where this has gone on for a while, people can light their well water on fire and whole towns have been ruined. The gas comany will supply them with trucked in water while they drill, but after they move on they are fucked. This is just in the US,it is 100 times worse in third world countries and the propblem is not the population, it is the corperations.

 Sorry dude. 




 Good point, I too have noticed "bragging rights" syndrome.
It's usually about brands, but what really bugs me is the whole
"super steel" thing. There is no super steel,different steels are made
for different purposes, period. D2 is good for a camp knife while 
carbon steel is better for a butcher knife,VG10 holds an edge forever
but if you use it to chop wood or bone it chips and takes forever to sharpen. 440c is a good all around choice used by Buck and many
custom makers for years. If it's well made and works it's a good 
knife IMHO.

 I am inclined to agree with brightbrightfish. My grandpa came here from Germany in the 30's and while he loved his heritage he never bragged about it. He played harmonica and acordian,made willow crafts, was an acomplished wood worker in the old ways ect, but first and formost he was an American.  if anyone referred to him as a German he would let them know that he worked hard to get here and even harder to learn the language and pass the tests to become a citizen of the USA and he was proud of that.Whatever happened to that way of thinking?

 I think your dad may have it backwards,This is typical of native style construction.Where the handle and blade meet both would be notched,wrapped with whatever open on the blade end, and liquid babbit(a pewter like metal) would be poured in to form the bolster.As an after thought,I imagine this was probably learned from the pioneers as I have seen old tools put together this way.

 Music evolves first from imitation then inspiration then inovation.The blues came from African spirituals . Blue grass came from colonial spirituals.Combine them and write risque lyrics: Rock N Roll! Combine all that with a Europian accent:The British invasion of the 60's. Any musician that whines about another copying his "style" is a douch.Never heard Muddy Waters complain about other artists playing electric guitar,and never heard Hound Dog Taylor complain about George thorogood playing loud distorted slide. 




 Nasty pussy. 




 I agree.That being said, I also feel that a person buying from a breeder should also have to prove their ability to understand the needs of a certain breed and their sincerity to provide a stable home.ASPCA requires this to a certain degree,it should go double  for breeders.Too many people buy pets based on their own vanity then dump them when the responsability kicks in. 




 Where I live,If you say you have more than a couple drinks a week social workers start coming to your bed side to "help" you. 




 Walmart. 




 Net flix has it. 




 Actually this happens far to often. 




 Frank Zappa would have loved this guy,shut up and play your guitar!
 




 Gates is using his money to try to better the world ,I love that. But don't forget the "Woz", a genious who never compromised himself for money. 




 A stupid old flash game called Castle Attack,used to play this for hours just to hear the funny death screams. 




 Astrophysics,holy crap! 




 Smaller cereal boxes,raise price on detergent and call it concentrated.

 Hint: Save the silica pacs from med bottles and toss them in that drawer.

 Hendrix was a master,I hate this kind of shit.
 




 Top Gear= one of the best shows on TV!
 




 As an American I would call this snooping. show up at 8pm unanounced and see if you can find something to gossip about. Dealt with it before and told people to not be so rude.
 




 Yes I do. The design is perfect for what I use it for. More of a cooks knife than a chef knife.

 I hate the cesspool of organized religion,but I must give this man credit for leading by example and practicing what he preaches.

 Kershaw or Buck. 




 Reposts. 




 Clean them up and then google their value.Old Case knives are always worth something, probably the Marbles too. Both are worth keeping. 




 This guy is just another Sharpten media whore,a cigar? ,Really?
I agree that racism is alive and well in this country, but when I see this kind of shit it makes my heart sink. If you really care about the issue then adress it intelligently. BTW Zimmerman is some kind of Hispanic and the victem was black.These guys have seperate gangs that hate each other,no whitey involved. In the end it's the money that wins every time. 
  




 This man is a patriot.Anyone who thinks our government cares about the common man/woman is deluded. It's all about taking our money and giving it to the corps. Any dissent will be picked up by the nsa and sent into the prison system. So sad.

 They do fund NASA in secret,the mission is to beam up all our paychecks to outer space and then use the money to fuck us some more. 




 Some people go out just to vent their anger on someone.
That being said, go to a privatley owned  eatery where the staff are professional.
 




 SHTAAAAP! 




 My ex would attack like a she-zilla and if I pushed her away it was,"YOU PUT YOUR HANDS ON ME!" Did the same to her son and tried to have him arrested. Some loonys use that poor woman thing to their advantage. 




 Easy buddy! Not trashin anyones biz or Palatka itself,just a true culture shock story.I didn't name the place and there are alot of bars around there. Had some good friends there and miss alot of things about it, the prices at Millers,take a drive to Hastings and pick up free taters along the road,my friends at the Clock,the river(Georgia sucks!)Palatka song writers,pig races at the fair,tales of the Bardin booger,The Oasis(I got freinds in low places) and so on.But my original post is true,not rumor and not the only story I could have told. It's just how some people were when I lived there.


 




 I lived in Palatka in the late 80's. Was in a bar and noticed there was a drive-up window but no driveway , asked if they were putting one in. "Nah, that's where the the nagers order then they goes n sits in the barn out there." 




 Hey,nice dress. It would look great crumpled up on my bedroom floor! 




 smoke a few one hits, watch some South Park and laugh out loud. 




 My hat goes off to you sir! 




 Monsanto moth,if it stings you they sue you for venom infringment. 




 If I find any more I will post them,Thanks for the interest. 




 Poor Billy Raye! 




 I love my Shuns,great steel,great looks and no heel,I hate the heel.
The handles are also a joy. Would I use my Shuns at work in a super busy 20 seat tourist town diner? ARE YOU CRAZY?! They hang on the wall in their bamboo "Shrine" and I use them for special dishes. I also love my original Pure Komachi set,cheap but very sharp and look nice.
I use these daily at home for light duty stuff. My home beater is an old high carbon forged that I had professionally reground. The point being,
buy what you like and don't listen to self professed experts,most of them are not experts.If you like it get more,If not,well now ya know.
I agree Vics are the best buy and always recomend them to my home use friends but they're not for me. "Far better than Shun for less"?
DON"T YOU BELIEVE IT! Those are German brands trying to imitate Shun. As far as the edge holding debate goes,serious Japanese chefs
sharpen their knives on a stone EVERY day. The knife I use at work?
 A gaudy tv personality signature knife that I bought on a whim and turned out to be perfect for what I need at work. Ha Ha! enjoy your Shuns! 




 At work we use waitress abrbeviations as joke insults:
"Hurry up ya feakin BBmuf!" " Yeah I'm commin Sesbag!"

 Strap in folks, it's only gonna get worse. Those scum-bags don't even pretend to be working for us anymore. 




 Only two? 




 Saw the origanal Lynyrd Skynyrd band back in the day at an amphitheater with a huge lawn for outdoor seating.Security in those days was just some rent-a-cops to keep people from jumping over the fence.this was THE biggest party I have ever been to, probably 16 to 18 thousand people,booze,all the illicit stuff,everyone just having a rowdy good time and Skynrd were spot-on kick-ass JAMMIN!
But wait...there's more! They played just about all their stuff except Free bird and Sweet home Alabama and said good-night,crowd is really nuts with encores, lighters,(remember that?) and rebel yells.
They come back on and do a short set and finish with Free bird then say good-night again.Crowd is now going nuts again and this goes on for about 1/2 an hour, the stage is dark and people are starting to get ready to leave.A loud voice from the darkness says, "What song is it you wanna hear?"and then,dun dun dada da dun dun dada,and the stage lights up like a Christmas tree.A confederate flag big enough to cover the entire back-stage drops and they launch into Sweet home.
I have never seen anything like it, it was raining beer cans, the screaming could drown out a jumbo-jet,just...nuts. One last thing, this was in upstate NY.

Just one, but it takes a long time and the light bulb must really want to change.
