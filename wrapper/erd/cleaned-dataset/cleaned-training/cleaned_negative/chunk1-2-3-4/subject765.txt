 Vine: Me eating a do- 




 That is for soreness after you run. Fermentation is not an immediate process, it takes time. Lactic acid is a side product of fermentation. If you really want to rid yourself of being sore, stretch. It won't get rid of the pain but it will spread the lactic acid out throughout your body and you will feel it less.  




 GLaDOS: "There was even going to be a party for you. A big party that all your friends were invited to. I invited your best friend, the Companion Cube. Of course, he couldn't come because you murdered him. All your other friends couldn't come, either, because you don't have any other friends because of how unlikable you are. It says so right here in your personnel file: "Unlikable. Liked by no one. A bitter, unlikable loner, whose passing shall not be mourned. Shall NOT be mourned." That's exactly what it says. Very formal. Very official. It also says you were adopted, so that's funny, too."

 There are two white doors, one the door the heaven, one is the door to hell. Once you open you may never go back. Connected to each door is a machine. One tells nothing but truths, the other nothing but lies. You do not know which is which. You have one question to find out the answer. What do you ask?




ANSWER:
"What would the other machine say is the door to heaven?"
and do the opposite. 




 Was that a pun you sly bastard? 




 Not a teacher but another kid in elementary school went on for about 5 minutes about his brother's wet dreams. Didn't really know what they were at the time, all I remember was the vivid hysterical laughter of the teacher as she ran out of the classroom.

 Whack it while you still can 









 All straight men can agree we have a natural desire for the female breast, why? They are not a reproductive organ and only real purpose is to breast feed. Is it just something to play with or is it just something we have all agreed to be attractive?

 The diet of a gay horse does not differ from that of a straight horse. That being said it is uncommon for two male or two female horse to be sexually attracted to each other, as it goes against their genetic drive to reproduce. The usual farm diet of a horse can be split into two parts: structural (fiber) and non structural (sugars and starches). Naturally the horse needs complete access to a fresh water source and an open plain. 

The following article should have sufficient information for those looking into the proper diet and nutrition for their horse:

 Religion CAN be a beautiful thing in this world. Many teach people to be kind loving creatures. The fathers of most all religion were men who wanted to enlighten the world with their teaching. I believe religion is stupid. However it would be stupid of me to believe someone is stupid for believing in religion.

 I was 12 at the time. We were driving north up the country (about a 10 hour drive). I had just discovered masturbation at the time and I was still in the obsessive "honeymoon" stage. I sat on my phone flipping through the bikini photos of 2011 sports illustrated swimsuit edition. As I sat hunched over under my blanket I made the most daring decision of my life, to wank it.

 It was still a scramble. White didn't have full control, for that hold he would have had to be behind him for it to count, and it wasn't (but almost) a pinning combination, so no takedown.

 That sounds awesome. Great suggestion, man.  




 My school has a great program with great kids and coaches but this year we just kept loosing on forfeits. Kids at out school kinda think of wrestling as the gross sweaty gay boys wrestling on the ringworm infested mat. Any tips to get more people to try the sport?
