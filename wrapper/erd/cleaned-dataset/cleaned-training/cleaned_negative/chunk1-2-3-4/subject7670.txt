 Of All Time. Those are big, scary words. But when I think of my favorite books, I think about the books that had an emotional impact on me, good or bad. Blood Meridian by Cormac McCarthy always comes to mind when Im thinking about books that match that criteria. At the end of it I kind of just slowly closed the book and stared out the window for a while. It was also one of the rare books that I had to re-read to really get a better grasp on.

Id been writing to try and get published for a while. Then I took a break from writing altogether to pursue a career in law enforcement. Then I decided to write as a sort of stress relief, and to write whatever the hell I wanted to write and not worry about publication. Ive always been interested in survival and post-apocalyptic stories and sobamThe Remaining was born.

Oh man. What character do I identify with? Dont make me say it! Obviously, I identify with Lee in a lot of ways, but if Im being honest with myself, Lee is way more political than I am. Id probably have to say Im most similar to LaRouchefriendly most of the time, but with a tendency towards self-sabotage and kind of coarse. I really do have a warm caramel centerit just takes a little whiskey to get it out.

Haven't read it, so couldn't speak intelligently. 




 Dammit! Theyre on to me!
*pretends to write furiously*

Thanks for reading! 




 My name is DJ Molles. I got started self-publishing The Remaining series in 2012, got picked up by a publisher in 2014 (Orbit), and recently made it onto the New York Times bestseller list. The Remaining series is set to wrap up with the sixth book, Extinction, this month. Im currently neck-deep in my next writing projects, and loving it. Ill be answering your questions starting at 7pm EST, so have at it!

Edit: That's it for me tonight, folks. I'll check back in tomorrow evening to make sure I answer any late-comers. Thanks for stopping by! 
























 Thanks! 




 You know, as the story progressed I really started to enjoy Harper and Julia. I really liked the arc of those two characters, and how their own relationship with each other started to change. I started to look forward to writing their sections the most. 




 Wowie, there are some badass authors out there. I feel the need to give you a top ten list. But...I will force myself to answer your question: When I think of a favorite author, I actually think of Blake Crouch because I have yet to pick up a book of his and not like it. Simple as that. 
























 Christian Rummel was absolutely awesome! I loved having him as the narrator. They let me hear one of his voice samples, reading my stuff, and I remember thinking, Holy cow. This dudes really into it. He did an absolutely phenomenal job. I didnt have a choice, but I wouldnt have chosen different.

Ah, the post-apocalyptic genre. First, Im glad that its becoming a genre all its own. I think it deserves that. And where its heading? Man, it could go anywhere, thats the beauty of it. Or terror of it, depending on how you look at it. I think people will start to move away from zombie and I also think people will start to move away from describing the period of collapse itself, because its been done on so many different permutations. However, an apocalyptic event (virus, EMP, nuclear war, you name it) that collapses current world society? Well, what grows up in that vacuum? The possibilities are almost limitless, and frankly Im pretty jazzed about it. Ive actually been doing some pretty substantial writing behind that concept. Wink-wink, nudge-nudge.

Youre absolutely right about the quantity out there in the post-apocalyptic space, and particularly with zombies. Now, Ill admit I havent read it yet, but I thought the concept behind The Return Man by VM Zito sounded pretty freakin original. Cool idea there.

Nowwhy are post-apocalyptic books so popular? Man, thats tough to answer. Some sort of global consciousness that things are going downhill fast? That were heading towards something bad? Maybe. I dont count anything out. Maybe its just a fad. On a purely practical level, I think it makes great stories. Where else can you distill people down to their nuts and bolts, than at the end of everything? People act the way they act in society because we have rules. You take away the rules, people will act different. People will be who they truly are, not the face they put on to be socially acceptable. I find that concept fascinating, and I think its fertile ground for compelling stories. 




 It is, isn't it? I use "Mane and Tail." That's the secret. 




 Ahahahahaha! Ladies and gentlemen, my former partner!

And I yell "America" any chance I get. 
























 Oh, LordyI could write a thesis on this. Does anyone need a ZA thesis for their college final? I got you.

So, to try to distill it down to a bite-sized morsel, I already live in the middle of nowhere, so thats check one: be away from people. I already have enough basic essentials to last me a few months, so thats check two: dont get noticed until things calm down. Yes, I know. Not very action-packed. But hiding in a dark house with the shutters closed is realistically your best bet. Once the initial collapse begins to taper off, then you can get a feel for how things are developing and actually come up with a plan of action for how to proceed. But before that point, theres just too many variables. Everything else would just have to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, using my best judgment for the circumstances. 




  Nicks got questions! Ill do my best.

1. While I dont have any solid story ideas already developed, I fully intend to return to the universe that I created for The Remaining. I think theres just too much going on there and Id love to dive in and address some of the other stuff that's going on, not only in the US, but maybe elsewhere in the world?

2. Actually the rights for the screen adaptation have been secured. They were secured a while back, and to be honest, Im not holding my breath. Hollywood is an amazingly fickle creature, and theres a strong possibility itll never actually be turned into anything on the screen. Id be pretty jacked if it did, though!

3. Did I have a roadmap? Lets see. How I approached The Remaining series was kind of like getting in your car and saying, Okay, Im in New York. I want to get to Los Angeles. I know at some point in time I will have to pass through some Midwestern states, and probably go over some mountains and bodies of water. And then you throw the atlas out the window, dash your GPS device on the curb, and hit the gas, heading in the general direction of west.

4. Fractured. That thing was a sonofabitch. Not only was it the longest one in the series, but it also had a lot of interplay going on, which, prior to that point, I hadnt really gotten into. It took me a while to figure out how to get all those threads to tie together in a way that not only made sense, but was fun to read. All in all, I love how it came out. But I probably tore my hair out the most on that one.

5. Well, without going into too much detail, Im shopping out a book right now called Wolves, and Im writing the first of a three-part series that I.have no idea what Im going to call. Wolves is a work Im really proud of and cant wait to get it out, whether its traditionally published or self-published. It really delves into some of the worst and best parts of humanity.

6. Yes, Id love to get those two short stories out. Ive been planning on starting a blog/website and posting them to there, butIve been procrastinating. Sorry. 

7. To aspiring authors, I would say just write. Sit down and write. Write until you have a book. Don't worry about whether it's good or not. Just get it down on paper (or screen). You'd be amazed at the breakthrough of just finishing a book. Then you can worry about whether it's good or not. But first it needs to actually exist. 




 Yes it does! July 28th.

JL Bourne was a big inspiration for me, actually. Just the fact that he made it from posting these stories on his blog while overseas? I thought that was pretty awesome. And yes, I enjoyed the books too, although I wasn't quite expecting the ending...
