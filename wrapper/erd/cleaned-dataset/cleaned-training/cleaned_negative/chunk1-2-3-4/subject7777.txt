 Hawaii and Arizona do not follow daylight-savings time because they recognize that it is a fraud, and a clear and present danger to the spacetime continuum.

When a program shows at 8:00pm Mountain Time during DST, the conflicting signals cause electrical arcs to surge from the ground in Arizona an hour into the future, killing anyone not wearing crocs or rain boots.  This is much like Tesla's experiments with pulling power out of the vacuum using a wet paper bag and a magnetron.  It was far too dangerous and the program was pulled.

 I usually stop thinking about it when I recall that.. he took a beating to get to where he was on more than one occasion, which means he's more dedicated to the experiment of government than I am.

 It did allow me to read up on Presidential Candidates, but then had no coverage of John Lewis' positions on major subjects for the congressional seat race, which is then further confusing.

 I think one of the biggest problems is not coming up with a vague enough title for people, or using an existing trope for titling.

 Yeah definitely, especially if your immune system is under some other kind of stress [i.e. day to day b.s.]

The best way I've found to get rid of small warts like that is to schedule the doctors' appointment to freeze them off, at which point you'll have to cancel when they miraculously disappear.
