On June 6, 1991, plaintiff sued defendant, a brewer and seller of beer and malt liquor, claiming that defendant had violated the provisions of the PAA by placing before the public advertisements for its products that contain "statements and/or representations which are untrue, deceptive and/or misleading." As a result, plaintiff claimed, he and the general public had been led to consume defendant's products, which defendant knew were dangerous and likely to cause serious health problems, including addiction and death. In support of his claims, plaintiff pointed to defendant's television advertisements featuring Bud Light as the source of fantasies coming to life, fantasies involving tropical settings, and beautiful women and men engaged in unrestricted merriment. Plaintiff sought monetary damages in excess of $10,000, alleging that defendant's misleading advertisements had caused him physical and mental injury, emotional distress, and financial loss.
Defendant moved for summary disposition, arguing among other things that it had no duty to warn of commonly known dangers. The trial court agreed with defendant's analysis in this regard, and granted summary disposition in its favor. We agree and affirm.

 Last July  I read a story about an 8-year-old girl, Abby Enck, who, in the most genuine of ways, came up with a plan to share her love of coloring. I encourage you to read more about Abby in the link provided, but in a nutshell  shes one of the most inspirational people I have come across. Abbys younger brother Cameron was born with Cerebral Palsy and she would regularly accompany him to Lutheran General Hospital on his medical visits. Abby noticed that the other pediatric patients liked to color, but many of the crayons were broken. Abby had purchased some crayons with her parents for the patients, but it didnt end there. For Abby, it was the obvious thing to do  think up a way to raise money so that she can buy crayons and other coloring materials for the patients.
Abby conducted a lemonade sale. Soon the 8-year-old came up with a plan to raise money by creating lemonade kits using bottled water with attached packets and tags with her very own message, When life gives you lemons, color!. She gained the help of family and friends and before she knew it she was on her way to a goal of purchasing 1000 boxes for the children at the hospital.

 As someone who frequently gets stopped while walking because "someone" reported some minor unprovable crime or "suspicious activity" I have my doubts in this case. It's one of the most common go-to reasons police use for a bullshit stop to provide reasonable suspicion. 

Why would you doubt someone calling about you?

It's one of the most common go-to reasons police use for a bullshit stop to provide reasonable suspicion.

considering how often police have been proven to lie lately

You need to step away from the media machine.  Take into consideration the number of police officers there are in this country, the number of interactions each may have every single day, and then compare to the number of instances that actually get blown up.  Too many people are drinking the media kool-aid. 




  You seem very convinced that this person and their "report" aren't fabricated. 

I'm never 100% convinced of everything unless I know the full details of everything from both sides.  With that said, and from what I've read on this specific instance, there is nothing there to cause me to doubt what happened.  

That is not a reasonable attitude.

Sure it is.  Why?  Because there is nothing there to cause me to doubt it.  What exactly is there about this instance that makes you question the reliability?  Have you wondered at all about the man that was stopped at all and what he was/may have been doing or is the fact that he's not the police officer enough for you to not question his motives?

 




  Spotted by who?

By a person whose yard he was running through.

 Apply that logic to income inequality.

Because that's an entirely different subject.

The wage gap continues to grow and the lower classes do not resort to violence. But because they don't take drastic actions, they don't get results.

Occupy Wall Street certainly didn't do anything.

That's his point, America praises the Boston Tea Party in which America finally revolted and took charge. America fought a violent war to get change from Britain.

The patriots fought for independence, to become their own country.  What exactly are the riots doing and how is it going to change things?

Strictly non-violence is exactly what your opposers want you to use because it doesn't insight enough fear in them

Yet show your full hand right off the bat and it's not going to instill fear either.  Additionally, things like this have been played out before.  Someone fucks up, huge uproar, riots, riots, more riots but not as bad, less riots, and then eventually people go home and do whatever it is they do.

 Is the store in your neighborhood of six houses?  Did you ask all of the neighbors?  If you did, is it not possible that they were lying?  Is it not possible that your son was lying to you?  Was it your neighborhood that someone was seen running through the yards? 




 IF he was actually doing that.

And until anything else comes out this is all we have to go on.  I mean, that's how things roll right?  When a police officer is accused of doing something wrong then in the eyes of the public they are guilty.  Shouldn't it be the same the other way around?  Not like we're talking about an angel of a man here:

*Pusok, 30, has felony and misdemeanor convictions over the last 10 years, including resisting arrest, animal cruelty, grand theft auto and attempted robbery.*  That is from [this](http://www.sbsun.com/general-news/20150424/francis-pusok-questioned-by-sbpd-day-after-650k-settlement-okd) article.

 




 So did you ask everyone in the neighborhood?  Did you personally have eyes on all of the yards at whatever time a call might have come in?  

Did anyone actually see him running though backyards other than a police officer ?

Yeah, the person that called the police.  

There are [other articles](http://www.sbsun.com/general-news/20150424/francis-pusok-questioned-by-sbpd-day-after-650k-settlement-okd) about this online besides the one here that appear to be a little more detailed. 




 Well, show me it's just something the police are saying then.  He wasn't spotted by the police, they were responding to a call from someone else about someone running through the yards. 




 Nobody in the neighborhood had reported any such thing to the police.

Did you ask everybody in the neighborhood?  And if so, and they knew you were asking about your son, do you trust that they'd be honest with you? 




 Francis Pusok, 30, was stopped sometime between 6 a.m. and 7 a.m. April 22 in the 3700 block of Elm Avenue after he was spotted running through backyards of homes, 

I would hope a person running through people's backyards at that time in the morning would be stopped to see what they were doing.

The 2009 Pittsburgh police shootings was a shootout that took place on Saturday, April 4, 2009, at 1016 Fairfield Street[1] in the Stanton Heights neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States, stemming from a mother and her 22-year-old son's argument over a dog urinating in the house.[2] At approximately 7:11 a.m. EDT, 22-year-old Richard Poplawski opened fire on two Pittsburgh Police officers responding to a 9-1-1 call from Poplawski's mother, who was attempting to get the police officers to remove her son from the home. Three police officers were ultimately confirmed dead, and another two were seriously injured.

According to Pittsburgh Police Chief, Nathan Harper, Poplawski was armed with a semi-automatic AK-47-style rifle, a shotgun and three handguns (a .357 Magnum revolver, a .380-caliber handgun and a .45-caliber handgun), protected by a bulletproof vest, and had been lying in wait for the officers. According to police and witnesses, he held police at bay for four hours as the fallen officers were left bleeding nearby, their colleagues unable to reach them. More than 600 rounds were fired by the SWAT teams and Poplawski.

The victims were the first Pittsburgh city officers killed in the line of duty in 18 years. The incident was the second-deadliest attack on U.S. law enforcement since the September 11 attacks, following a shooting two weeks earlier in Oakland, California.
On June 28, 2011, Poplawski was sentenced to death by lethal injection on three counts of murder in the first degree.

 So about those week long peaceful protets that were happening and noone paid any attention or could of gave a fuck. What did those do?

Well, you have [this](http://blackwestchester.com/2015/04/27/10000-peacefully-protest-bmore/):

*What they dont report was there were, Muslims, Christians, Jews, Blacks, Whites, Asians, Young and Old, Rich and Poor people all united and standing harmoniously against common oppression, shared one of the organizers Frank Sha Francois. The demonstration was sponsored by a wide coalition of social justice groups, including Malik Shabazz of Black Lawyers For Justice (BLFJ), Carl Dix of Stop Mass Incarceration (SMIN) and brother Ted Freedomfighter Sutton of Sutton House, just to name a few who came in support of their brothers and sisters in Baltimore. Support for justice of Freddie Gray, 25, who was arrested one week ago, in West Baltimore. Who died on April 19th, from injuries sustained while he was in police custody.*

Here's what that does.  It shows a united front of all different types of people.  It shows that people want something done and they are willing to be civilized human beings, sit and discuss the problem, figure out a solution, and fix the problem.


The police are not innocent people

Pretty broad brush stroke there no?  Are there bad cops?  Absolutely.  Are they in the minority.  Yep.  If we want to paint broad brush strokes, would you then agree that "black people are criminals" based on a small percentage that are acting out violently and criminally?

they need to be brought to justice and held accountable

The ones that abuse their power?  Absolutely.

it will not happen thru peaceful means.

Yet it's been proven time and time again that it does.  What do violent/criminal acts do?  They give the city a reason to increase the number of police officers on the street and hire more.  It creates and/or strengthens a stereotype that then turns into bias/profiling.

HAHAH fuck off with the mlk thing

Yeah, because that would go against your agenda and proves you wrong.

 like things havent changed since 9/11 that make peaceful resistance useless

You're right.  Things have changed.  Such as, this country is far less racially divided than it was during the time of MLK.  **HE** was able to bring change, peacefully, in a far more hostile environment.  The environment is nowhere near as hostile today, yet people cannot impact change peacefully?  This just sounds like sheer laziness.

Boohoo other people lives are being disrupted while others fight for their fucking lives

If that's the attitude you want to give, then expect the same attitude in return.  

It's time to stop using the race card and playing victim.  People want to blame others for their situation instead of pulling their own shit together and taking personal responsibility.  You don't want the cops bothering you?  Then don't give them a reason too.  You want to succeed in life?  Then work for it.  Harming other people's lives, ruining their livelihood, creating destruction, and not acting like a civilized human being has never caused progress. 
























 Keep on fighting for your rights and freedoms peoples

Fighting for what rights?  The right to attack innocent people for no reason?  The right to destroy property that doesn't belong to them?  The right to disrupt other people's lives?  The right to steal for their own selfish benefit?

Liu Kang was originally going to be a Japanese character called Minamoto Yoshitsune, but Mortal Kombat co-creator and character designer John Tobias stated that the staff could not "deal with the name." According to Tobias, Liu Kang "was originally going to be a traditional monk  bald and in robes  but he wound up resembling Bruce Lee." As stated on his Mortal Kombat: Armageddon bio card, Ed Boon mentioned that Liu Kang was designed to be the most easily "accessible" character, meaning that both casual and experienced gamers could play as him with little difficulty. According to Tobias, Liu Kang was purposely the only character that voiced his finishing move in the original game, and was "the best" in the first sequel. Liu Kang was the only character in the first game whose finishing move (Fatality) did not explicitly murder his opponent, and also without the background dimming. This was because Liu Kang was depicted therein as a Shaolin monk, who in general have strict beliefs regarding killing and murder. However, starting with Mortal Kombat II, he was given gory Fatalities as he was thereafter depicted as a renegade monk who decided to grow his hair back, and who had "strong Shaolin beliefs, but was no longer a part of the Shaolin monks." In response to rumors that Liu Kang would die in Mortal Kombat II and therefore not make it into Mortal Kombat 3, Boon said, "It'd be like doing part three of Star Wars and not having Luke Skywalker in there. You don't do that." His eventual death caused Dan Forden, the music composer of the series, to make a "funeral song" for Liu Kang as he felt saddened for his death. The track titled "Liu Kang's Tomb" would be used in Mortal Kombat: Deception in the arena that shows his tomb.

After practice, in the locker room, he was told there was a high possibility
he could be a bone marrow match for a complete stranger. Of the 12,000 blood
cancer patients who require marrow, 70 percent do not have matches in their
families.
When I got the phone call, I was so shocked, said Lyle. I totally forgot I
even signed up a couple of years before. Even then, I did not think I would be
a match. The odds are so ridiculous.
After additional testing, Lyle was confirmed as a definite match. There was
no time to waste. The surgery was scheduled immediately for April 25. There
was one catch: the surgery would take place one month before the end of his
college career.
Lyle never feared the actual marrow donation surgery. He worried the most
about telling his coach that he would be sitting out the final part of his
senior season because of the surgery. His coach, though, was supportive. Jim
Boulanger, director of New Hampshires track and field program, told Lyle that
sports do not triumph life, they are merely a part of it. If you have the
chance to save a life, do whatever it takes.
If Lyle chose to be a donor, his collegiate career would stop cold turkey
without the closure a championship win would bring him. As he threw his last
shot at the Stony Brook Invitational on April 20, his teammates surrounded him
to help bring one chapter of his life to a close. For him this was closure.
Hugs were shared and although it was not the ending he planned for, he was
allowing a stranger the chance to start a new chapter of his own.
Even with that elusive conference championship within reach, Lyle never had
any second thoughts about donating  especially when he learned about the man
who would be receiving his marrow donation.
Lyles 28-year-old match was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia a
few days before Christmas in 2012. He had a fianc and a nineteen-month-old
son. For Lyle, this information solidified his decision to donate.
I would have done it anyway, said Lyle. But knowing he is just starting
his life, he has so much ahead of him, makes it worth it. It hits home because
he is only a few years older than I am.

Art's left arm was severely bleeding from what appeared to be surface wounds. The doctors pulled out close to 50 pieces of glass embedded into his skin on his left arm, he said.
He also had four to five broken ribs and his hip severely broken in several places. Art spent eight weeks in a body cast and had a tracheotomy to help him breathe easier.
Because all of the blood was assumed to be from glass cuts and the hip injury was so severe, doctors failed to notice a metal rod  the T-bird's turn signal arm  was embedded in Art's left forearm.
Art and Betty met six months later on a blind date.
Let's fast forward to 15 years ago when Art discovered there was something in his arm because of a metal detector at the courthouse in Jerseyville, Ill.
His doctor checked it out and thought it was from the accident, but no telling exactly what it was.
In fact, the doctor thought it could have been a surgical instrument forgotten and sewed up inside his arm. But, because it didn't bother Art, the doctor said to leave it alone.
In early December, the arm started to pose a problem after Art carried a cement block. After feeling a little pain, days later he started to notice a protrusion. Art was referred to a specialist.
Doctor Lang removed the seven-inch rod on Dec. 31. The procedure lasted 45 minutes.

Asimina triloba, the pawpaw, paw paw, paw-paw, or common pawpaw, is a species of Asimina (the pawpaw genus) in the same plant family (the Annonaceae) as the custard-apple, cherimoya, sweetsop, ylang-ylang and soursop. The pawpaw is native to the Eastern, Southern, and Midwestern United States and adjacent southernmost Ontario, Canada, from New York west to southeastern Nebraska, and south to northern Florida and eastern Texas. The pawpaw is a patch-forming (clonal) understory tree found in well-drained, deep, fertile bottom-land and hilly upland habitat, with large, simple leaves and large fruits. **The paw paw is the largest edible fruit indigenous to the United States.**

The first lawn mower was invented by Edwin Budding in 1830 in Thrupp, just outside Stroud, in Gloucestershire, England. Budding's mower was designed primarily to cut the grass on sports grounds and extensive gardens, as a superior alternative to the scythe, and was granted a British patent on August 31, 1830.

Budding's first machine was 19 inches (480 mm) wide with a frame made of wrought iron. The mower was pushed from behind. Cast iron gear wheels transmitted power from the rear roller to the cutting cylinder, allowing the rear roller to drive the knives on the cutting cylinder; the ratio was 16:1. Another roller placed between the cutting cylinder and the main or land roller could be raised or lowered to alter the height of cut. The grass clippings were hurled forward into a tray-like box. It was soon realized, however, that an extra handle was needed in front to help pull the machine along.Overall, these machines were remarkably similar to modern mowers.

New posts were and are being added without being automatically deleted. Ergo, the rule is not being enforced in general.

And what?  You're talking about posts going back **years** yet the rule pertaining to police brutality wasn't in place at that time.  Not a difficult concept to understand why those ones were not removed.

So far, every post added after the rule has not been removed

Yet you weren't even aware of the rule in the first place so how do you know when it was added?  Additionally, it's highly improbable that the mods are going to catch every single post put up on here so I'm not surprised *every* post added hasn't been removed.  With that said, you also have no idea how many have been removed because you can't see them anyway and have no idea what has actually been posted and taken down in totality.

despite all of them being "related" to something in the news in the last 8 years

The rule doesn't talk about *something in the news* in the last 8 years.  It mentions many different aspects within the rule itself that requires only an elementary school level of comprehension.

 if the mods want to delete everything in TIL

I'm pretty sure they want to delete everything in TIL **that doesn't abide by the posted rules.**

In the meantime, the rule is meaningless.

Why is it meaningless?  Because you can't grasp the simplicity of it?

Women have used tampons during menstruation for thousands of years. In her book Everything You Must Know About Tampons (1981), Nancy Friedman writes, "[T]here is evidence of tampon use throughout history in a multitude of cultures. The oldest printed medical document, Papyrus Ebers, refers to the use of soft papyrus tampons by Egyptian women in the fifteenth century B.C. Roman women used wool tampons. Women in ancient Japan fashioned tampons out of paper, held them in place with a bandage, and changed them 10 to 12 times a day. Traditional Hawaiian women used the furry part of a native fern called hapu'u; and grasses, mosses and other plants are still used by women in parts of Asia."

The stereotype of Jews eating Chinese food on Christmas does have an origin. In 1935, the New York Times reported that a restaurant owner named Eng Shee Chuck had brought chow mein to a Jewish childrens home in Newark on Christmas Day. This article is considered to be one of the earliest publications of the stereotype that relates Jews to Chinese food on Christmas.

The relationship that Jews have to Chinese food certainly goes deeper than this stereotype. Eating Chinese [food] has become a meaningful symbol of American Judaism For in eating Chinese, the Jews found a modern means of expressing their traditional cultural values. The savoring of Chinese food is now a ritualized celebration of immigration, education, family, community, and continuity. Chinese food is considered a staple in the Jewish culture, and the further option of kosher Chinese food is also becoming more and more available in the US.

In Berlin in 1931, Dora R, born as Rudolph R, became the first known transgender woman to undergo the vaginoplasty surgical approach.

This was followed by Lili Elbe in Berlin during 1930-1931. She started with the removal of the male sex organs, the operation supervised by Dr. Magnus Hirschfeld. Lili went on to have four more subsequent operations that included an unsuccessful uterine transplant, the rejection of which resulted in death. An earlier known recipient of this was Magnus Hirschfeld's housekeeper, but their identity is unclear at this time.

The Iranian government's response to homosexuality is to endorse, and fully pay for, sex reassignment surgery. The leader of Iran's Islamic Revolution, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, issued a fatwa declaring sex reassignment surgery permissible for "diagnosed transsexuals." Eshaghian's documentary, Be Like Others, chronicles a number of stories of Iranian gay men who feel transitioning is the only way to avoid further persecution, jail and/or execution. The head of Iran's main transsexual organization, Maryam Khatoon Molkarawho convinced Khomeini to issue the fatwa on transsexualityconfirmed that some people who undergo operations are gay rather than transsexual.

**Thailand is the country that performs the most sex reassignment surgeries, followed by Iran.**

On 12 June 2003, European Court of Human Rights ruled in favor of Van Kck, a German transsexual woman whose insurance company denied her reimbursement for sex reassignment surgery as well as hormone replacement therapy. The legal arguments related to the Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights as well as the Article 8. This affair is referred to as Van Kck vs Germany.

The Three Sisters are three rocky islands in the Potomac River in Washington, D.C., west of the Key Bridge. A notable landmark in colonial times, the islets are less well known as the Three Sisters Islands and Three Sisters Island.

Various legends are associated with the Three Sisters. One of the earliest myths involves three Algonquian sisters who crossed the river in an attempt to win the release of their brothers, who had been kidnapped by another tribe. They drowned while crossing the river, and were turned into the rocky islets. A less commonly cited legend says three daughters of the local Native American chief were marooned on the islands by their father after rejecting the husbands he picked out for them. The legend holds that the sisters cursed the spot, saying that if they could not cross the Potomac there, no one could. A strange moaning or bell-like sound is said to come from the Potomac River when the curse is about to claim another life.

The first European to see the Three Sisters was Captain John Smith, who sailed up the Potomac River and saw them in 1607. The islets were a landmark in colonial times, and appeared on Pierre L'Enfant's first map of the area.

General Order No. 11 was the title of an order issued by Major-General Ulysses S. Grant on December 17, 1862, during the American Civil War. It ordered the expulsion of all Jews in his military district, comprising areas of Tennessee, Mississippi, and Kentucky. The order was issued as part of a Union campaign against a black market in Southern cotton, which Grant thought was being run "mostly by Jews and other unprincipled traders." In the war-zone, the United States licensed traders through the United States Army, which created a market for unlicensed ones. Union military commanders in the South were responsible for administering the trade licenses and trying to control the black market in Southern cotton, as well as for conducting the war. Grant issued the order in an effort to reduce corruption.

Following protests from Jewish community leaders and an outcry by members of Congress and the press, at President Abraham Lincoln's insistence, the General Order was revoked weeks later on January 17, 1863. During his campaign for the presidency in 1868, Grant repudiated the order, saying that it had been drafted by a subordinate and that he had signed it without reading it during warfare.

It was legalized by royal decree in 1751, in part due to George Whitefield's support for the institution of slavery.

Being a member of the Science Club gave the children special privileges. The parents were told that the children would be fed with a diet high in nutrients. However, they were not told (and the consent form contained no information indicating) that the food their children were fed contained radioactive calcium and iron. The information obtained from the experiments was to be used as part of an advertising campaign. The company was later sued because of the experiments.

Nearby buildings totaling 37,000 square feet (3,400 m2), were purchased by PNC and deconstructed to make space for the Tower at PNC Plaza.The project was estimated to cost $400 million when announced in 2011 (or $419 million today). Construction started in spring of 2012 and is planned to be completed in September 2015. The tower will be the greenest Skyrise ever built and will exceed the current criteria for a LEED Platinum certified building. The Tower will feature numerous sustainable attributes such as an operable double skin facade, an onsite blue water reuse system, locally sourced building materials, fixtures and furniture made from recycled materials, and numerous other green strategies to substantially reduce the environmental impact of the building. Some of these features will enable the Tower's heating and cooling systems to operate in a "net-zero-energy state" up to 30% of the year.

After attempting to develop his own version of the proposed show called House of Mystery, Joseph Barbera, who handled the development and sale of Hanna-Barbera shows while William Hanna handled production, passed the task along to story writers Joe Ruby   Ken Spears and artist/character designer Iwao Takamoto. Their original treatment, based in part on The Archie Show, was titled Mysteries Five, and featured five teenagers: Geoff, Mike, Kelly, Linda, Linda's brother "W.W." and their dog, Too Much, who were all members of the band "Mysteries Five," including the dog who played bongos. When "The Mysteries Five" were not performing at gigs, they were out solving spooky mysteries involving ghosts, zombies, and other supernatural creatures. Ruby and Spears were unable to decide whether Too Much would be a large cowardly dog or a small feisty dog. When the former was chosen, Ruby and Spears wrote Too Much as a Great Dane, but revised the dog character to a large sheepdog (similar to the Archies' sheepdog, Hot Dog) just before their presentation to Silverman, as Ruby feared the character would be too similar to the comic strip character Marmaduke. Silverman rejected their initial pitch, and after consulting with Barbera on next steps, got Barbera's permission to go ahead with Too Much being a Great Dane instead of a sheepdog.

George Washington's will directed the building of the present vault in the following words: "The family Vault at Mount Vernon requiring repairs, and being improperly situated besides, I desire that a new one of Brick, and upon a larger Scale, may be built at the foot of what is commonly called the Vineyard Inclosure. . . In which my remains, with those of my deceased relatives (now in the old Vault) and such others of my family as may chuse to be entombed there, may be deposited."

Immediately after Washington's death, Congress resolved that a marble monument should be erected to his memory in the new Capitol in the city of Washington, and that his family should be requested to permit his body to be deposited beneath it. Martha Washington's consent was solicited and obtained. A crypt was provided under the dome of the Capitol, but the project was never completed. In 1831, the surviving executors of Washington's estate removed the bodies of George and Martha Washington and those of other members of the family from the old vault to a similar structure within the present enclosure at Mount Vernon.

 









 Where in your source does it say that?  This is a clear violation of rule one.  This is what I found in your source...........which I was able to get to after having to verify my age and search through a table of contents.

This is what I found:

*How is the alcohol content in beer measured?*

*Alcohol content in beer is typically measured in one of two ways: by volume (which is most common) or by weight. Using Coors as an example: A 12-ounce serving contains 5.0 percent alcohol by volume which means that of all the liquid in the container, 5.0 percent of the liquid is alcohol. The same 12-oz. serving of Coors Light is about 4.0 percent alcohol by weight, which means that of the total weight of the liquid in the container, 4.0 percent of the weight is contributed by the alcohol.*

*Sounds simple, but if we're talking about the exact same serving of beer, why the difference between volume and weight measurements? That's because a given volume of alcohol weighs less than the same volume of water. (An ethyl alcohol molecule, or C2H5OH, is larger than a molecule of water, or H2O, and takes up more space.) So whatever the serving size, the alcohol weight percentage will always be smaller than the volume percentage. This basic fact should help dispel any myth about 3.2 beers or so-called "near-beers" allegedly containing much less alcohol compared to regular beers. The "3.2" in 3.2 beers represents the percentage of alcohol by weight, which means that there's about 4 percent alcohol by volume in the beer. Anyone who believes that he or she cannot become intoxicated consuming 3.2 beer is just plain wrong. If you know of anyone who's a believer in the 3.2 beer "myth," do him or her a favor and share the facts.*

 When you have one of the agencies coming out and saying that the Patriot Act did nothing, then why does this "need" to get done?  Because of something that **might** happen?  If that's the case, let's make it rain in new laws because of something that **might** happen.   




 In pretty much every country on earth blocking traffic is par for the course in protests. And it is usually the most effective tactic.

Effective in doing what?  Getting results?  If that's what you're implying, I'd love to see some evidence to support that blocking traffic is the most effective in getting results.

 Yet, while there is in fact no way to prove this, I doubt Iraq would be in this current situation (at least at this level) if we hadn't gone in on false information, obliterated their infrastructure, and made promises that we never kept.  We'd also still have thousands of U.S. military/civilian personnel among us as well. 

So while there is always this talk about who won the war/lost the war, it never should have happened in the first place.  There has to be a cause to create the effect. 









 Anytime I now see a bill with a name like this, I immediately assume it's full of some high level of crap.  How many people actually read the bills as opposed to just reading the title?  My guess is more go for the title, see something like "The Patriot Act," and then go all "Yeah! 'Murica!" And turn into a redneck sounding hick.

Thomas Harris has given few interviews, and did not explain where he got inspiration for Hannibal Lecter until mid 2013. Harris revealed that the character was inspired by a real-life Mexican doctor and murderer he met while visiting a prison in Monterrey city, in the state of Nuevo Len, during a trip to Mexico in the 1960s, when he was a 23-year-old reporter. The doctor was serving a life sentence for murdering a young man, supposedly a "close friend", mutilating his body into several body parts and putting them in a very small box. Harris, who would only refer to the surgeon by the fake name "Dr. Salazar", described him as a "small lithe pale man with dark red hair". He added: "There was certain intelligence and elegance about him." Harris had gone to Mxico to interview Dykes Askew Simmons, a US citizen on death row for murdering three young people in the country, but he ended up also speaking to "Salazar", who saved Simmons' life after a guard shot him during an escape bid. "Salazar" revealed his dark side as he began discussing Simmons disfigured face, tormented upbringing and how attractive his victims had been.

The Quintinshill rail disaster occurred on 22 May 1915 near Gretna Green, Dumfriesshire, Scotland at Quintinshill, an intermediate signal box with passing loops on each side on the Caledonian Railway Main Line linking Glasgow and Carlisle (now part of the West Coast Main Line).

The crash, which involved five trains, killed a probable 226[nb 1] and injured 246 and remains the worst rail crash in the United Kingdom in terms of loss of life. Those killed were mainly Territorial soldiers from the 1/7th (Leith) Battalion, the Royal Scots heading for Gallipoli. The precise death toll was never established with confidence as the roll list of the regiment was destroyed by the fire.

The crash occurred when a troop train travelling from Larbert, Stirlingshire to Liverpool, Lancashire collided with a local passenger train that had been shunted on to the main line, to then be hit by an express train to Glasgow which crashed into the wreckage a minute later. Gas from the lighting system of the old wooden carriages of the troop train ignited, starting a fire which soon engulfed the three passenger trains and also two goods trains standing on nearby passing loops. Some bodies were never recovered, having been wholly consumed by the fire, and the bodies that were recovered were buried together in a mass grave in Edinburgh's Rosebank Cemetery. Four bodies, believed to be of children, were never identified or claimed and are buried in the Western Necropolis, Glasgow.

The cause of the accident was neglect of the rules by two signalmen. Both men were charged with manslaughter in England, then convicted of culpable homicide after trial in Scotland; the two terms are broadly equivalent. After they were released from a Scottish jail in 1916, they were re-employed by the railway company, although not as signalmen.

A memorial to the dead soldiers was erected soon after the accident and there are more recent memorials at various locations. An annual remembrance service is held at Rosebank Cemetery.

In China, during the Tang Dynasty (618907), paper was folded and sewn into square bags to preserve the flavor of tea.

The first tea bags were hand-sewn fabric bags; tea bag patents date as early as 1903. First appearing commercially around 1904, tea bags were successfully marketed by the tea and coffee shop merchant Thomas Sullivan from New York, who shipped his tea bags around the world. The loose tea was intended to be removed from the sample bags by customers, but they found it easier to brew the tea with the tea still enclosed in the porous bags. Modern tea bags are usually made of paper fibre. The heat-sealed paper fiber tea bag was invented by William Hermanson, one of the founders of Technical Papers Corporation of Boston. Hermanson sold his patent to the Salada Tea Company in 1930.

**The rectangular tea bag was not invented until 1944. Prior to this, tea bags resembled small sacks.**

Hagfish, the class Myxini (also known as Hyperotreti), are eel-shaped, slime-producing marine fish (occasionally called slime eels). They are the only known living animals that have a skull but no vertebral column. Along with lampreys, hagfish are jawless and are living fossils; they are basal to vertebrates, and living hagfish remain similar to hagfish from around 300 million years ago.

The classification of hagfish has been controversial. The issue is whether the hagfish is itself a degenerate type of vertebrate-fish (most closely related to lampreys), or else may represent a stage which precedes the evolution of the vertebral column (as do lancelets). The original scheme groups hagfish and lampreys together as cyclostomes (or historically, Agnatha), as the oldest surviving class of vertebrates alongside gnathostomes (the now-ubiquitous jawed vertebrates). An alternative scheme proposed that jawed vertebrates are more closely related to lampreys than to hagfish (i.e., that vertebrates include lampreys but exclude hagfish), and introduces the category craniata to group vertebrates near hagfish. Recent DNA evidence has supported the original scheme.

The Mara Salvatrucha gang originated in Los Angeles, set up in the 1980s by Salvadoran immigrants in the city's Pico-Union neighborhood who immigrated to the United States after the Central American civil wars of the 1980s.

Originally, the gang's main purpose was to protect Salvadoran immigrants from other, more established gangs of Los Angeles, who were predominantly composed of Mexicans and African-Americans.

Many Mara Salvatrucha gang members from the Los Angeles area have been deported after being arrested. Namely, Jose Abrego, a high-ranking member, was deported four times. As a result of these deportations, members of MS have recruited more members in their home countries. The Los Angeles Times contends that deportation policies have contributed to the size and influence of the gang both in the United States and in Central America. According to the 2009 National Gang Threat Assessment, "The gang is estimated to have 30,000 to 50,000 members and associate members worldwide, 8,000 to 10,000 of whom reside in the United States."

In recent years the gang has expanded into the Washington, D.C. area, in particular the areas of Langley Park and Takoma Park, Maryland, have become centers of MS gang activity.

Track 61 is a private railway platform for the Metro-North Railroad in New York City, located beneath the Waldorf Astoria New York hotel and just outside of Grand Central Terminal. The platform is part of the Grand Central Terminal complex.

First used by General John J. Pershing in 1938, and later by Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1944, the platform was not originally intended to be used as a station, but its location made it ideal for unobtrusive access to the hotel. The track was also used for the exhibition of American Locomotive Company's new diesel locomotive in 1946; in 1948 Filene's and the New Haven Railroad staged a fashion show on the platform. As of May 1, 2014, it has been reported to still be in occasional use.

In 1846 Massachusetts Governor George N. Briggs appointed a commission to study "idiots" in the state, and this study implicated cousin marriage as responsible for idiocy. Within the next two decades, numerous reports (e.g., one from the Kentucky Deaf and Dumb Asylum) appeared with similar conclusions: that cousin marriage sometimes resulted in deafness, blindness, and idiocy. Perhaps most important was the report of physician Samuel Merrifield Bemiss for the American Medical Association, which concluded "that multiplication of the same blood by in-and-in marrying does incontestably lead in the aggregate to the physical and mental depravation of the offspring". Despite being contradicted by other studies like those of George Darwin and Alan Huth in England and Robert Newman in New York, the report's conclusions were widely accepted.

 And going back in history, "knowing what we know now," is not repeating history.  It's pretending that we can look into the future.
