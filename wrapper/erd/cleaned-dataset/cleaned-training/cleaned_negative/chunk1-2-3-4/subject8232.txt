 Hey everyone! So, I recently picked up my weber performer, and along with it my wife got me a smokenator 1000, and I grabbed a pitmaster iq110. Because it's a performer, it has ash catching hardware on the bottom, so I have to install the iq110 manifold off to the side somewhere.

Once I have it installed, is there a particular side I should set up the smokenator in relation to it? Should the air intake be below the smokenator, or should it be on the opposite side? 




 Hey everyone!
After 3 years of eyeing it, I finally picked up a Weber performer gold last week, along with a smokinator 1000, an IQ110 temperature controller, a maverick et-733, and a bunch of other toys. We broke it in with some t-bone steaks, burgers, and dogs (totally traditional!). Hands down the best T-Bone I've ever had (brought it slowly up with indirect, and then seared for about 2 minutes one each side to finish and bring to final temp). It was like butter!

I've been using on using royal oak hardwood lump charcoal for grilling, and plan to use stubbs all natural briquettes for long slow stuff.

I am going to be smoking a Boston butt monday for dinner for the week (overnight dryrub sunday into monday early AM, then applewood smoking).  Since I haven't used it yet due to mother nature being uncooperative, I've been watching videos of folks using the smokinator with the same cut. In most, folks are mentioning a smoke of about 8-10 hours, but then in [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VdxA5BntFs) he goes almost 16 hours. This is what brought about my question.

How do you know how long to smoke the meat? When it hits the target (190 ish) shouldn't you remove it? The guy making the video says in the beginning he's expecting a 16 hour smoke - how does he come up with that? It's probably a simple question but the times seem to be all over. If it's based on weight, a lot of the cuts seem to be about the same size range (8-10lbs), so why the difference in times? How do you plan for it? 




 Hey everyone. I am looking to start purchasing some bullion with bitcoin. So far the options seem to be amagi metals, agora commodities, coinabul, and bitgilt (if I don't mind waiting for overseas shipping and feel lucky about customs).

Has anyone dealt with any of these companies? I see lots of negatives posted about coinabul. I also see complaints about Amagi shipping VERY slowly. I can't find out much of anything about Agora, or overseas shipping with bitgilt.

So, does anyone have any others that they use and know to be reliable? 




 Just checking out the price and it seems to have dropped a good bit over the past day. What gives? Is it a big selloff? Or is it from the bitcoin price going up against the dollar and doge, while doge more or less keeps steady against the dollar?

Not scurrd, I'm still long with doge, just curious what everyone is thinking. 




 Pretty simple. I have about 30 or so hits which have been sitting as pending for several months (3+ months). What recourse do I have to get the money I earned? Can I report them for non-payment? 




 Hey everyone (sorry for the periods in the title, automod has a bug up its ass).

Since I can't mine anymore and I refuse to buy asics (single purpose hardware is a waste, and honestly just contributes to trash heaps), I have been investing my coins into several projects to earn a return on my investment. I saw that doge d.i.c.e and just d.i.c.e both allow you to invest in the house, earning a 1% return over time. Have any of you played with it? Have you had success?

Are there any other places where you can earn interest off of your coins that you are using?

The one other place I've been using is a bitcoin arbitrage company which gives about a %1.2 return daily. 









 Hey everyone. I have a paper wallet which I'd like to cash in. Right now I don't have access to my main litecoin client, so I was hoping I could create an online wallet and import it, or get an android wallet and import that way. Can anyone suggest a method for doing it? Downloading the full client isn't an option at the moment because our workplace doesn't allow much outbound connectivity. 




 Pretty simple! I would need to get at least 500 made. Most likely the end price would be 15-20k doge including shipping. 




 Hey everyone. We are currently using an oracle-backed database solution for a product we purchased from a vendor. We received their IOPS estimate based on a spreadsheet and built our SAN to match their estimate. We have 2 2-node RAC clusters, running dataguard between them.

We are looking to perform an augmentation to handle additional customers on this database, but the vendor can't provide additional hard numbers for us to go on. So, what I want to do is look at our current number of customers and the current peak IOPS, and then extrapolate that out to our new number of customers and what we estimate IOPS to be.

The problem I'm running into is that AWR reports don't seem to work right in RAC (awrrpt.sql seems to report back very small numbers). So, for either of those RAC clusters, how can I get real IOPs to/from the SAN? Oracle is the only thing using it.

I hope there's enough info here, I'm still somewhat new with Oracle.

I found this script: http://srivenukadiyala.wordpress.com/2011/03/04/calculate-iops-for-a-rac-database/
but it doesn't seem to work :( 




 Hey everyone. We have a large oracle database deployed (it's bundled in a vendor's software). The vendor provided storage requirements in terms of IOPs, and I scaled the storage solution appropriately given only that requirement.

We are now preparing to augment our storage in anticpiation of additional workload. According to the vendor, we should be ok. However, to be frank, they're basing every one of their numbers on a spreadsheet, and they can't explain how they arrive to a lot of them. This is a big red flag for me.

What I want to do is look at the current IO utilization of the SAN, compare that to the number of users we have provisioned, and from there hopefully extrapolate approximately what our utilization will look like after the augment.

So, how can I best get an IOPs number for a SAN volume mounted to a system that is currently being used by a database? 









 Hey everyone! With the halvening come and gone now, remember, even though we may not be showing up in a lot of profitability lists for multipools, they still have significant piles of coins sitting and waiting to be exchanged. So, before you panic buy/sell make sure that you give the market a few days to adjust. 




 Well, it has been a ton of fun folks, but with this halving I will now be losing about 5$ a day thanks to power. I just want to say it's been a ton of fun, and I've really enjoyed mining doge. I also really want to thank the folks at teamdoge for everything.

At this point I'm either switching to a multipool or going to hop from crapcoin to crapcoin and see what profitability i can find. Given scrypt asics coming out, I don't see myself mining too much longer, and none of the scrypt-n coins seem to be very effective to mine.

So thank you all for the fun, I loved mining. At this point I've got my nice pile of doge that I'll be holding on to until I find something REALLY COOL I want to buy :)

Don't worry though, I'll be sticking around the sub because once a shibe, always a shibe :) 




 Hey everyone!
A few months ago we ended up pulling down an old flourescent tube fixture. I don't have measurements at the moment, it looks to be about 30 inches long but I could be misremembering. I'd like to pull the fixture apart and clean it. Then, I'd like to get some grow lights to help start seedlings. Are there any concerns about doing this? I know you're supposed to keep the light somewhat close to the starting tray to help provide a little warmth. Does light color matter, or can I just use any grow light? Should I use a 24x7 exposure to get them to sprout and then switch to something like 18 on 6 off for initial vegetative growth?

Any help would be awesome. 




 So, the last halving saw the price skyrocket leading up to the actual day of the halving. Folks were convinced that halving the supply of new coins would lead to fantastical increases in price.

Why the different behavior now? Do you think it's a function of muppet investors getting burnt once so they're staying out? 




 I haven't been able to find this. I know Kraken has it on the "to do" list, and so far I think the only exchange that features it is BTer. So, does anyone know if it's supported? Is it planned? 




 Just curious about this one. As I start to near 1m doge, I'm thinking about what to do with them. I don't buy much, and none of the current vendors seem to have things I want. So, I'd like to spend the doge doing things that can actually help spur on our economy, help communities, etc, but earn a profit on investment too.

Are there any groups out there that actively do this? 




 Let's make some friendly guesses!

I'm thinking we'll top out near 300 satoshi this time around. Just a leeeeeeeeetle bit higher than last time, but not too much. What do you think?? 









 I know I've seen a few services where you send someone a link to an item with shipping information, and they purchase it for you with doge. Has anyone used any of these services? Are they reliable? Can anyone recommend any? 



















 So, if I remember correctly, 1.6 is based on bitcoin .9. Bitcoin has stated that that version of the client was impacted, and has released 0.9.1. Due to the way heartbleed impacts the wallet-qt app, it could allow for coins to be stolen.

Are we going to see a patched version of our wallets anytime soon?

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=562400.0 has more information. Exploiting it requires rpcssl to be enabled. But if it is, you have to consider your wallet to be compromised. 




 Now that we can see that ASICs are here in force, can we have a serious discussion about merging or changing PoW? Because I'd like my million+ doge to be worth something in 3 weeks.

Yes, that sounds snarky, and yes, I fully intend it to sound that way. For months people have been trying to warn the community that something significant has to be done to make ourselves resistant to both multipools and to ASICs, but usually the cop-out response is "but it's hard!" or "Doge will be mined out before ASICs are a problem!" The latter is patently wrong. The former, well, is it better to avoid something hard, or have our coin be worthless in 3 weeks because one pool will control nearly 60% of our hashrate and no one can verify that any of our transactions are real?

1.6 was a band-aid. Instead of doing something significant, we changed our algo to allow for faster re-targeting of difficulty, to accomodate multipools entering and leaving. It got rid of a symptom, but not the cause. A cause that now controls more than half of our network.

[As of today, wafflepool controls 53% of our network hashrate](https://pools.rapidhash.net/pool/5). That means, if waffle was malevolent, he could start blocking transactions and initiating double spends. He controls this much thanks to sfire, a large chinese GPU farm that is now getting into ASICs, and is only going to have more in the future. Oh, and he's joked about doing a 51% attack against coins before. When we have a halving in 3 weeks, a number of miners, myself included, will be leaving because we're already barely breaking even for our costs. That means that sfire will control significantly more of the network hashrate.

So, can we please start considering the options that people always balk at because "they're hard!" Things like changing PoW so we're not scrypt compatible and most miners/asics aren't compatible with us. Or are we just going to stand by and watch as our coin plummets to 0 because we refuse to do something because it's difficult? We can keep choosing to "see what happens" until our coin dissolves in front of us, or we can actually do something.

I for one would like to do something. 




 Right now we are essentially getting spammed with repeat threads showing a lot of ignorance, half-truths and FUD. It would be very helpful if we could have a sticky that dispelled that. 




 So, I've been piling up doge for about 3 months now, but I haven't spent a whole lot. Well, today that changed!
http://saltsworldwide.com/buy/fleur-de-sel/

Now if only there was a spice vendor that sold more than salt! :) 




 Simple question - I see lots of API's for connecting to bitcoind/dogecoin-qt, but I can't find anything that lets you simply generate a public address/private key pair. Does anyone know of a library to do this?
 




 Hey everyone! A few days ago there was a shibe from Belgium who was willing to purchase and ship goods directly (things like chocolate, beer, etc). I was wondering if there were any shibes doing that for the Netherlands??? I'd love to get some beer from Brouwerij 'T Ij! 




 I'd like to investigate a non-3rdparty escrow system for a site idea I have. I know some systems out there for escrow (especially in darknet markets) are able to do multi-signature transactions. 

Basically, you provide a private key to the escrow service, they send back a public address, you send the funds to the public address and the escrow service verifies that the funds are received, the vendor sends the product, the buyer confirms it, and then the funds are released to the seller.

Here's a good writeup:
http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/3718/what-are-multi-signature-transactions

So, is this supported with dogecoin? 




 I've been looking at the candlestick for cryptsy since last night, and unlike the other recent spikes, I don't see anything weird going on. It looks organic.

So, what do you think? Is this the kickoff of the price increase before the halving as folks buy in? 




 Hey everyone!
I am looking at writing a program, but one of the things I'd like to do is execute trades. What exchanges support doge, and provide an API that allows you to sell via API calls?

I know cryptsy will let you do it, what about others?? I'm a beginner so a well documented API would be hugely helpful 




 So, is there anything like ebay/craigslist out there that can be used easily?

Edit: I suppose I should be more specific - I am looking for non-registered businesses. Specifically, I'm looking to purchase gold and silver from folks who aren't looking to report it to the IRS :-P 




 I just wanted to throw this out there - not all multipools are evil.

Pools such as multipool.us, hashco.ws - they don't automatically convert to BTC unless you tell them to.

The real problem we're seeing is multipools that **auto-exchange** for another coin. This causes prices to consistently drop on exchanges because coins are always being dumped at or below the current market price to ensure a quick sale. 




 Simple!
`use a backtick` to enclose whatever you want to write!

`It` couldn't `be` e`a`s`i`e`r`! 




 I'm curious about this. Yesterday I posted to find out who else was starting to get records in order in accordance with the IRS reporting requirements. I got downvoted to hell.

This morning I posted a link to the IRS form 8300 with a warning that if a vendor fills out that form (usually it's for transactions over $10k, but it can be submitted for much smaller transactions, and is routinely done so by precious metal dealers) and submits it with your contact information and you don't report capital gains/losses on the sale, you could be in for an audit and potential legal trouble. Again, downvoted to hell.

So, /u/ummjackson states that he welcomes regulation, but yet when the IRS regulates, the overwhelming sentiment from /r/dogecoin seems to be "ignore it! don't pay taxes!" 

So, why is that? It seems like actively trying to flout the law is pretty un-shibe. Also, I'm pretty sure that telling people to do things that are illegal, like not paying their taxes, is also against reddit rules. 

So, whats up shibes? Why the jump from "embrace regulation!" to "BOO REGULATION! DON'T PAY ANYTHING!"? 




 It looks like hashco.ws is exploring payouts in other BTC currencies for folks who want to do auto-exchanging. Right now they're only working with Mintcoin, but you may want to send them feedback if you're one of the folks who wants a multipool that pays out in doge. 




 [Let me introduce IRS form 8300.](http://www.fincen.gov/forms/files/fin8300_cashover10k.pdf)

Basically, this form has to be filed by a business anytime that a monetary instrument (cash, bitcoins, dogecoins, goats, glass beads) is received in an amount larger than $10,000 USD, or in a series of smaller related transactions. It also can be reported if cash transactions are smaller at the vendor's discretion.

So, where you should be concerned is if you're thinking "It's ok! I'm never converting to fiat, I'm just going to buy things and not worry about reporting!" Well, not so much. If the vendor chooses to report the transaction and you *don't*, the IRS now has a very good, clear reason to audit you. And if it shows up that you tried not to show them the earnings? Have fun getting arrested.

If you want you can reach out to vendors who are either overseas, or who won't submit the form, but that's super shady and you could get burnt, but it could work.

So, for all of the folks saying, "don't worry about reporting!" that's really not the case.

For everyone overseas, well, you're lucky ducks! :) 




 If anything, this may be one of the most important results from the IRS ruling yesterday. 

The whole concept of 1 doge = 1 doge requires that dogecoin exist in a vacuum, where no other currencies exist. It assumes that no one will ever convert to other currencies, or should even compare the value to other currencies. The IRS ruling shatters that - the day coins are mined, they must immediately be given a base price in USD. 

So, can we please, *PLEASE* stop yammering on about how 1 doge = 1 doge? 

Or, is it better that people keep their head in the sand and end up getting audited and arrested because the dumb motto told them they didn't have to worry about the value in USD?

IRS Ruling:

http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-14-21.pdf 




 Ugh, this sucks. 

I mine both doge and btc. For the most part I hold doge, btc I convert to fiat (a small amount gets squirreled away to an offline wallet).

Right now I'm putting together a spreadsheet of every disbursement I've ever received in btc/dogecoin, every transfer I've made, every transfer fee I've accrued, every time I've cashed out on coinbase, every fee from coinbase, every fee from the bank, etc. Next I have to look at my earnings each day, figure out what the "closing" cost of the coin was each day, figure out the Fair Market Value of that day's earnings, etc.

These requirements are going to be a huge PITA. But, I'm doing what I've got to do to stay legal. I'm hoping I can take this to a financial advisor and find out the feasability of starting an actual business. It would be nice to write off the cost of my mining hardware and my power usage.

Anyone else starting to go through this process? 




 [Bitcoin-trader.biz](https://bitcoin-trader.biz/?ref=msarro) (yes, that's my ref link, feel free to crop off the =ref part on the URL).

So, I have been looking into this site and I can't seem to find much information. I have an account, and again, the link above is a ref link, but I haven't used it yet.

There are a couple comments about the site on a few forums from seemingly happy users, but that's about all I can find. There are also some videos on youtube talking about earning 10+ bucks a day off of it, but they seem to be folks fishing for referrals.

They seem to emphasize referrals and downlines which has me concerned that part of their sexy payouts is a ponzi scheme. Their daily earnings for the trading pool over the past 20 buziness days average around 1.241%. That would put you at around 29$ for every 20$ invested over the 120 day term. I'm not sure if the mining pool is worth it since it's returning .6% on investment daily right now.

So, has anyone used them? Any success or horror stories? If you want to play around with it, feel free to use the ref link above or just go to bitcoin-trader.biz and check it out. 




 100000 doge!
I'm just testing to see if there are bots that are looking for the [GIVEAWAY] tag. Please don't post if you're a human. 









 So, I understand that it gets rid of "gaming" block rewards. It also allows difficulty to be rapidly re-targeted.

However, per the owners of several multipools, they're not planning to stop mining doge, it just becomes "another scrypt coin" that can't be gamed. So, it seems like all of these "goodbye multipools!" threads are a bit misguided.

Is there something else in 1.6 which will actively prevent multipools? 




 I just want to give you all a big virtual high five. After recent constructive criticism about no organized press releases when we meet big goals, I logged in today to see several. A bunch of shibes stepped up to spearhead getting it done, and folks took those releases and put them out to the news. And guess what? We are showing up!

I'm on the board of directors for a nonprofit, and the biggest problem we have is getting people to follow through on good ideas. Folks always have the best intentions, but a lot of times people don't follow through to get things done. You guys give me faith that those folks that can get things done really are out there.

I am so proud to be a part of this community! 









 Hey everyone. For a long while I've been interested in woodworking, and have been slowly trying to outfit a workshop. So, I think I'm about ready to take the plunge as soon as I can locate a scroll saw.

Are there any good starter kits to cover the basics? I'm familiar with how a lot of the tools work, but I'm by no means an expert, especially when it comes to building jigs and stuff.

As a first real project, I want to build my wife a puzzle box. Specifically, something like this:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWNSXyRO5nE

I can't find plans for it, so I am working with sketchup to build it from the ground up. My wife's dad is a mechanical engineer, so I'll probably have him looking over my shoulder. So, do you think I'm jumping in too deep for a first project? Should I find some woodworking "kits" to work on first before trying to build my own thing? 




 So, I have a weird issue where aggressive config settings cause sgminer to crash at launch (specifically if I set memclock to 1500).

 I know you guys are running ragged right now, but you may want to update this (or at least do it when 1.6RC files are available). 




 I'm switching everything to Kraken, unless someone can tell me if there's another exchange with really good volume and supports metatrader? 









 Simple question that isn't addressed in the announcement, and my post hasn't gotten any responses there.

If the software is being released in 24 hours, is it ok to install immediately? Does it switch internally at 145k? Or do we have to update at the same time as the pools? 














 The way I see it, we have a few threats to our currency:

1) Multipools exploiting random rewards.

2) Multipools sending difficulty skyrocketing when they suddenly turn their sites on doge.

3) ASICS. People have been saying that this isn't a real threat. Guess what? They're rolling off production lines. They're here, and they're only going to get better. For you and I it is prohibitively expensive to purchase 10 of them for $2500. However, what about the manufacturer? They've got literally thousands on hand at any given time, and all they need is a few USB controllers to hook them up in a side room of their warehouse. This explains several of the multi-GH whales that have started appearing on some pools.

The feedback from devs so far has been to fix random rewards (which addresses number 1), and implement something like a gravity well (which addresses number 2). Number 3 still doesn't seem to have any solution, we're just relying on time and the hope that "doge will be mined out by then". Hoping isn't a solution.

So, why not look at implementing scrypt-jane (something with adaptive n-factor) instead of vanilla scrypt? This would make our coin largely incompatible with most multipools out of the gate, and it addresses most of the issues with a single monolithic change instead of several smaller ones. For most miners, it would be a fairly trivial change to the kalroth version of cgminer.

It seems like we're fixing several issues with multiple fixes instead of implementing one large fix that can mitigate all of them. I'm not saying that the other issues shouldn't ultimately be resolved, but if we're doing one hard fork, why not address as many issues as possible? 




 Usually on the pool I use it shows as around 2800-3000KH/s.

As of about 5 minutes ago, it's showing 300KH/s.

I really hope my rig isn't on fire. LOL 




 Many companies, when they start to grow, will do stock buybacks. This lowers the number of shares on the market for trade, thus increasing their value.

We could donate mined doge/cash, the foundation buys it back to hold, and in exchange there could be some kind of return to investors. I have no idea what it would be, I'm only beginning to think through the idea. But I'd love to hear some feedback.

I have to give credit to /u/CokeRobot for making me think of it with his idea of everyone buying 1800 doge a piece.

 Simple! post your favorite thing or memory from the dogecoin community! Let's bring some positive vibes! 




 There are 70000 shibes registered in this sub. That means if every single one of us donated 1000 doge, we'd blow the roof off of our goal.

So, how does this raise the value of dogecoin? Simple - PR. When we meet the goal, we can send out press releases. A TON of them. Everyone in the community can get in touch with their favorite news website and provide the press release. It's what's called a media or marketing blitz. We push to have as many news articles out at the same time - make it impossible for people to miss it. Good news means more people are interested, more people get into the market, and the price goes up because demand goes up. 




 Ok folks, how can we get ourselves in the news again? I know right now we're working on doge4water, but what else can we do? How can we pump up search volume? How can we get more vendors interested? How can we inspire shibes sitting on the sidelines to either spend their doge, or open small businesses? How do we keep spreading the love??

We have an awesome opportunity, so how do we move this forward? 




 Hey everyone. I'm just curious about these settings... I tried it before, and the result was pretty catastrophic. I saw a huge decrease in my hashrates, and I also saw my number of rejects skyrocket compared to normal single-pool usage.

However, I've switched from a single threaded approach to a multithreaded approach, and in general I've seen my number of rejects plummet. Has anyone gotten load balancing working nicely? What pros and cons have you experienced? 




 So, for the past 3 weeks i'd found a configuration which was "stable" but only on 14.1 drivers in BAMT 1.5. If I tried bamt 1.3 or 1.5.1 (using 13.1 and 13.2 drivers respectively) almost any setting would cause a crash on bootup.

With the 14 drivers, my GPU engine will never go above ~980mhz, despite being a Sapphire TRI-X OC R9 290 which is supposed to have a factory overclocked base speed of 1000 Mhz.

Well, this evening I decided to try things a little differently. I'm still using bamt 1.5 with 14 drivers, but I decided to cut xintensity down to 8, and i configured 2 gpu threads.

Holy cow. Where before a "good" pool was giving me 3% rejects, I am now on what had been the "worst" pool for me, a multipool, and I am hovering at around 0-0.5% rejects. On top of that, my kh/s is hovering around where it had been before.

I think I'm in love! Also, since this is a bit less intensive, I am going to try 1.3 and 1.5.1 again, and see if the different drivers provide an additional boost.

So remember folks, sometimes it's better to finesse your rig than it is to just go balls to the wall with overclocking :) 




 Just saw this... looks like Helixminer asics are going to be released in the next few days. Based on early reports they're looking significantly more stable than the previous dualminers. They're approximately 300KH/s, consume less than 100w, and cost about $295 (+/- $10)

I'm contemplating picking one up just to tinker with... anyone else checking them out? 









 Pretty simple, really. Every day I see posts coming in about things "you shouldn't do." Things like:

* Don't day trade
* Don't convert doge to other currencies
* Don't compare the value of doge to other coins, or fiat currency
* Don't mine at large pools
* Don't mine at multipools

Well, I'm here to tell you to *ignore them.* 

You're an adult. You can make your own decisions. You are also responsible for the *consequences* of your decisions. The whole idea behind cryptos is to free people from bodies that exist solely to tell them what they can and can't do. Do what you want, just make darn sure that you know what you're doing before hand.

Just try not to lose sight of the fact that we're trying to build a community too while you pursue your own interests. Stay active and participate. We need you here, and not just staring at candlesticks. Enjoy your freedom and see where it takes you. 









 Seems like almost every altcoin is down this morning - it's a good time to buy doge if you have some free BTC on hand since they seem to be getting pumped right now.

Anyone have any insight? Is there some new news I'm missing? 









 I am looking at their services and am considering trying them out for the tips/doge exchange. Has anyone used them? Are they reliable?

Hey everyone, I picked this up for my mining rig, but ultimately ended up not needing it. It is in all original packaging, the only thing missing is the shrink wrap (it was literally used 1 day until I realized my rig was too far from the WAP). It supports windows, osx, and linux.

Because this will involve shipping a physical good, I'm going to ask that you pay first to help cover the cost of shipping.

NOTE: For linux, this is the [B1 revision](https://wikidevi.com/wiki/ASUS_USB-N13_rev_B1) of the device with the RTL8192CU chipset. To install it, you just have to go to [realtek website](http://www.realtek.com/downloads/downloadsView.aspx?Langid=1 PNid=21 PFid=48 Level=5 Conn=4 DownTypeID=3 GetDown=false Downloads=true#2772) and download/install the module and it should show up in wicd. 




 The title pretty much says it all. No matter what setting I put it at, the gpu just hovers there.

I've tried 1.3, 1.5, and 1.5.1 (the unofficial release with 13.12 drivers). In all cases, the GPU-Engine speed hovers around the middle 900's. The annoying thing is, the cards are supposed to be factory overclocked to 1000mhz. They just don't want to run that high. Any ideas what could be going on? 




 Prove yourself:
Pat's vs Geno's

There is only one correct answer. 









 Some folks have real expenses associated with being part of the community - expenses that can't be covered in doge. 

For instance, I know I have to make and sell/trade about $130 worth of dogecoin/btc every month just to cover power for my mining rig. So to me, 1 doge has a real value associated with it. 

While the majority of my coins get stored for long term, the stuff on the short term has a very real value beyond 1 doge = 1 doge, it directly translates directly to USD for me. Try to keep that in mind when someone is talking about value changes - they may need the market to cover expenses. 




 Seriously, do it.

There'd be a few more billionaires this morning if people had done this, and bothered to listen to the thousands of posts, suggestions, and outright warnings about using paper wallets, offline wallets, and never storing their money in exchanges. You can learn more by checking out this post:
https://bitcoin.org/en/secure-your-wallet

Treat your cryptos like they're real money, because they are. I know our community can sometimes come across like a starry-eyed hippie love-in, but we also have to remember that cryptos help increase anonymity, and where people think they can get away with something, they will try to. We also need to remember that businesses will fail. Any time you put your coins in someone else's hands, it's a chance for them to disappear. So make an offline wallet, use it, and take responsibility for your own money.

Good luck everyone. 




 The way my old investing mentor always put it was like this: "Suppose everyone smells smoke - bad investors scream 'FIRE!' And drop everything to get the hell out. Good investors run into the kitchen to get some BBQ before the bad investors realize it's there." 




 This is a pretty great discount considering the value of doge has fallen. You send me the doge, I send you the code to import into iTunes. This item was previously listed [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogemarket/comments/1yaa8a/sg_25_itunes_gift_card_code_for_18k_doge/) but the buyer never came back.

I have 1 card to sell. 
[SUCCESS] 




 Hey everyone!
This is my first post here, and I'm still very new to android programming. My background is in super-high level stuff (perl, python, mostly massaging data and doing BA). This is my first time really working with an OOP language as such.

So, here's my q... if you have a data structure set up to hold a superclass, can you also put subclasses of that superclass into it? So, say you have a list of Car, could you also put MazdaCar and BMWCar in it too? Or would it only hold objects of Class Car?

The same goes for interfaces... can you make a data structure to hold only objects of Classes which implement a particular interface?

I'm trying to determine whether or not to use an interface or straight inheritance, and this is a big factor for me. Thank you! 




 So, I've read through how PPNLS works several times, but I can't seem to find what the "target" is. I noticed most PPNLS pools seem to have a value, and it changes somewhat frequently. 









 So this morning I had dogecoin-qt open and I randomly got a database error. This was with wallet 1.5.1. So, I shut it down, opened it up, and now it refused to open because of database issues. So, I closed it, upgraded to wallet 1.5.2, and still, it refused to open.

So, I backed up my wallet.dat file and deleted the blocks/ database/ and chains/ directories in my dogecoin install and relaunched. About half way through, I started getting errors involving my wallet.dat file and read errors. Awesome.

I have a backup, however the backup is about a month old. Is that going to cause a problem? 














 Welcome to the official "rate my doge" thread! Where you can share that awesome pic of your fuzzy pal, and maybe get some doge for your doge!

**RULES**

* 1 doge pic per person. 
* I can't see everyone's scores (d'oh), so I'll just go by the number of tips each doge gets (no, you can't tip the same doge twice! (well you can, but it will only be counted once) 
* Voting will close sunday night at 10pm EST
* Any tips to my doge pic (should be the first one) will be added to the pot of 500 doge for the winner. Tips to other doges go to their respective owners :)
* Your score needs to be viewable

So gentlemen (and ladies), post your doges!

PS:
Imgur works as a file hosting site I think :)

**EDIT**

I had to change voting because a bunch of folks have their scores hidden. We'll now tally based on the number of tips each doge gets. In the case of a tie, winnings will be split between the tied doges! 




 Hey everyone! I'm a miner who has been mostly focused on doge, and mining on multipools for BTC. I decided I'll throw my hat in tonight to see how well my rig performs mining vertcoin. I'm pretty excited!

Does anyone have a favorite low fee pool that is stable (especially if it's PPNLS - nothing sucks more than a PPNLS pool that goes down every hour, lol)? 




 Hey everyone! I have a couple trades under my belt now, so you should feel safe. I receive these gift cards occasionally and already have about a $40 balance on itunes I'll probably never use, so, I may as well let someone get the card who can use it!
What you'll get: I will scratch off the card and send you the code, which you can then import into iTunes for the $25.

FYI this is a re-list from a few days ago, a gentleman said he was interested but never came back. The original thread is here:http://www.reddit.com/r/dogemarket/comments/1yaa8a/sg_25_itunes_gift_card_code_for_18k_doge/ 




 Just curious - is there anything stopping a 3-letter agency from creating a "vendor," and then creating a bunch of dummy accounts to pump up their ratings?

Is there something that lowers the influence of a review if it's A) a brand new account or B) the account has only dealt with one vendor?

It's something that jumps out at me based on the howto and looking at the site. 




 So, I am looking into starting a mining pool with some special tweaks that make it extra special.

I am working on the requirements now; I know I'll need server(s) for pushpool (or p2pool, or ecoinpool - i'll probably try each and see what works and what doesn't), front end server(s) running apache which I'm partnering with a developer on to customize, db server(s), and finally the coind software.

I have about 10 years of experience in enterprise network engineering/systems engineering/product engineering, so I am pretty sure I am ok on the technical side. The biggest thing I am missing right now is requirements for the actual boxes.

Is the DB read or write heavy? How much bandwidth can we expect per user? What's the rainy day scenario where you have a 5GH/s whale connect? How much storage is needed per user? What are the IO requirements for everything? What are memory/cpu requirements? I can't seem to find any of this information. I can test it using my laptop for some base info (it kicks out a mean 40KH/s!) but I don't know if it scales linearly or not. 




 http://invezz.com/news/forex/8924-forex-news-bitcoin-usd-resumption-of-play-at-mtgox-any-time-now

It looks like MtGox is going to be opening back up withdrawals, which should mean the BTC price tag should go up, and along with it, other altcoins (including Doge!). What does everyone think?? 




 Hey everyone! I have a couple trades under my belt now, so you should feel safe. I receive these gift cards occasionally and already have about a $40 balance on itunes I'll probably never use, so, I may as well let someone get the card who can use it!

Feel free to PM with questions. 




 Well, this is something that has come up lately when discussing this with other folks, and it's something I personally want to understand.

So, the developers of dogecoin write the software. What exactly did they write? Is it a daemon that generates blocks that are then requested or sent out somewhere? Did they just write the original block which creates something different? How do the pools or users get the blocks? Where do the blocks come from?

The idea of it being decentralized kind of puts the kibosh on a central daemon which generates each block, plus if that was the case, wouldn't it be difficult for the chain to fork?

So, once the blocks have been created by any means, we mine against them. But if solving a block is what provides a reward, how do pools and members of pools get paid if they don't "solve" the block?

Is there any good source on how the whole process of a crypto-currency works that doesn't get too deep into the technical weeds so that your average (or slightly above average) shibe can understand it? 




 I've noticed that there have a bunch of completely benign, benevolent posts lately that seem to get a bunch of downvotes for what seems like no good reason. Maybe it's because I'm new to reddit, but can anyone explain what the motivation is for that? Just being a jerk for its own sake, or do people actively disagree with community-supporting posts?

For example, this post from the creator of /u/dogetipbot:
http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1y8epn/a_few_minor_udogetipbot_announcementsnotices/

Why the heck are there downvotes there? 














 So, right now I've been piling coins into paper wallets. Should I ever import the paper wallet to an actual wallet.dat file, after doing that, is the paper wallet worthless? Or can it always be used to recreate the wallet.dat file? 




 Hey everyone. So I am playing with the rotate pool settings in sgminer and currently have it set to rotate every 12 hours through teamdoge, wemineltc, wafflepool, and multipool. Most of these are PPLNS, so I'm curious how long you really should be connected to each to maximize? I know it's set up to discourage pool hopping, but I'm wondering if 12 hours is long enough? 




 ...do you stick with only one coin? Or do you hop between different pools? I'm trying to diversify, so I've been switching between a few pools (some litecoin, some dogecoin, some like multipool that feed into a cryptsy account, and then hashco.ws). I can't really figure out which is the most profitable (I have to sell off enough to cover the cost of the rig plus power). So, what have you guys found to be the most effective? 




 Just curious, are you guys related to this redcoin?
http://redcoin.pw/

If not, how do you intend to keep your branding from getting confused with theirs? 




 So, I am following several guides to try and tweak this number.
http://www.reddit.com/r/dogemining/wiki/index/radeon_tuning_guide
https://raw.github.com/ckolivas/cgminer/v3.7.2/SCRYPT-README

In both cases, it says that thread-concurrency should be a multiple of my number of shaders (I'm using 3x Sapphire Radeon R9 290's, each has 2560 shaders). I have configured the base memory clock for the card according to manufacturer specs (1300Mhz), and the engine speed too (947mhz). I've also put the number of shaders in the config file (2560).

In the guides it says to keep adding on your shader number until your miner won't start. My problem is that sgminer just keeps starting. I have yet to find a value for thread-concurrency where it won't start, and use the value prior to that. I'm up to 48640 now.

Once I have that figured out I can start pushing up the memclock. Any ideas why it isn't behaving per the tuning guides?

When I tried running cgminer/sgminer without any options, it gave me two bin files, one with 30464, one with 30528. Neither one is a multiple of the number of shaders on the cards. 




 So, I pulled it down from github and compiled it. However when I try to run it, it just pops up a screen saying "Waiting to get work from pools..." where it sits for about 3 minutes, and then closes.
I've run it against 2 pools which SGminer can connect to no problem.

I've put it in a script with the options to export the display and set GPU environment variables. It just won't work :( 









 Just thinking about it - as soon as we past 100,000 and the reward halved, the multipools seem to have gone elsewhere. So, that should mean the difficulty on doge will plummet, won't it? 




 So, about a week ago I traded ~5000 doge on cryptsy for some bitcoin just to play around with it. However when I look at the blockchain explorer, my address doesn't reflect that the coins were ever traded; so it reflects a different balance than what is shown in my cryptsy account. Why is that? 




 Hey everyone!
So as of yesterday, my rig was finally assembled (3x sapphier R9 290 TRI-X). I started with BAMT, and am averaging about 800KH/S per card. That's great compared to laptop GPU mining, but still not where I wanted to be with them. I'm averaging about 970 watts at the wall, and a 5% reject rate (mostly stale shares, probably because I'm using a wireless adapter?). The cards stick at around 65 degrees C (fan rate set to 68%.

The vast majority of posts I see about them have them stable up into the 900+ KH/s region. If I start to tweak my settings beyond 1000/1350, the system almost immediately locks up, or GPU2 suddenly becomes "sick" in cgminer and the whole system has to be rebooted. For some reason my TC has to say at 40960 or else the system locks up. I've tried lower settings (2560 shaders * 8 + 1= 20481), but the system just freezes almost immediately.

One thing I am noticing about every one of these systems that are pulling 900+ KH/s is that they are *all* running windows. Every single one of them. So, for those of you who have tried both, do you recommend windows over BAMT if you aren't worried about a simple templatized drop-in OS?

Edit:

Other info -

* 4GB DDR3
* Sempron 145
* MSI 970A-G43 MoBo
* 3x Sapphire TRI-X radeon R9 290 (with hynix memory) 




 So.. which one do I hook my dvi cable to? Before when I did this it was for radiology workstations where you had a primary card, and then secondary card(s). So which one do I connect to? The top 16x slot? 




 LOL
Well, that's the second vendor I had tell me they had power supplies in stock, and then tell me they were sorry, and they didn't have them in stock and had to have them sent from the manufacturer, who "was having trouble meeting demand." So, I took the advice of a few shibes on here and picked up 2 850w power supplies at best buy for a lower price and overall more power output. I also picked up a crate, and had EVERYTHING ready to go.

However, why am I posting here instead of working on my sweet new mining rig?

I don't have a DVI cable, and my cards didn't come with DVI/VGA adapters. LOL.

At the very least I have one at work that I can use, so I'll get about 1.5 days of good mining before the halvening happens :) 




 Hey everyone. One thing that seems to keep coming up is the idea of making cash via trading. I am totally down with that. What is not cool, though, is people doing it without being informed.
For instance, can you read a candlestick chart? Do you have a plan to minimize risk? These are some pretty basic things.

The best way to learn them is through looking up online courses and tutorials about foreign exchange trading (FOREX). Basically, forex was traditionally trading dollars for euros, or dollars for yen, and vice versa. Then you'd take advantage and trade back to make money. Sound familiar? It's the exact same thing as trading cryptos, except the tools are a little more rudimentary (they don't have to be, but people haven't built something like metatrader for cryptos yet). Plus, unlike trading traditional fiat currencies, you can actually mine cryptos.

**Here are some small things that are helpful to know:**

* When you make a trade, define a point you want to exit, and commit to that.
* Try to never commit more than 2% of your total resources to a particular trade. It sucks to lose 2% on a trade, it sucks way more to lose 100%.
* Never trade on news. Seriously. The whole halvening thing? That's news. Stay away from it like it's the plague. Wait for the market to settle back down or you could see yourself getting nasty burnt. Don't believe me? Look at what happens to the candlestick charts of currency pairs like the Eurodollar whenever the Fed gives a statement. Trading on news can be profitable, but most of the time, it will leave you cold and broke.
* Keep your emotions in check. Always. They will lie to you. Do your best to use cold logic and numbers.
* If the crypto markets ever evolve to the point where you can use stop losses, USE THEM.
* Hedge your bets. Keep a variety of things in reserve. A mix of long term investment plus some trading is usually more successful than just exclusively trading.


**Here are some places to learn more about forex and currency trading:**

* http://www.babypips.com/school
* http://www.ufxmarkets.com/learn/forex-school

**This is a great guide on learning how to read charts (which are your best friend if you want to be successful in trading):**

* http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:chart_analysis:introduction_to_cand

**Another thing to keep in mind**, both IOS and android have free FOREX trading games you can download which use actual historical numbers between currency pairs. You can play with them and start to understand patterns of the market and improve your trading before you ever move a doge out of your wallet. It's invaluable practice. Some of them even have "news" events which can show you how a market moves when news comes out. 




 This is a pretty basic question. When you use cryptsy's auto-sell feature, what does it sell the coin for? Does it trade it in to "cryptsy points"? Does it trade it for BTC? If you have a bunch of TIPS, does it trade it for LTC and then trade that for BTC (there's no TIPS/BTC pair)? Their documentation doesn't say much, just that it "automatically sells." 




 Out of curiousity, when you go to sites like:
dogeaddress.org
liteaddress.org
bitaddress.org

Do you have to do anything to add the wallet to the blockchain? Or does simply sending coins to that generated address make it exist? If there's no central addressing point, how are collisions avoided? 




 http://blog.fiverr.com/fiverr-now-accepting-bitcoins

Interesting article - maybe once they get used to using cryptos they'd be a good place to look at convincing to accept Doge! 




 So, how do you all do it? Do you keep a ledger? A spreadsheet? I started keeping a notebook, but thanks to multipool I have a ton of other smaller cryptos which I don't really feel a need to track.

It'd be awesome if someone made something like "mint.com" for your cryptos. 




 YAY! They look beautiful. Now when my power supply shows up I can actually kick off the mining :)

 




 So, I'm waiting for my last few parts to arrive for my mining rig; not just for Dogecoin, but any other altcoin (I'm also really interested in Curecoin when it comes out). I am doing this as part of a side business I own because I thought it would be another revenue stream. I love dogecoin and its community, but I will admit I am here to make profit too. My goal is to use a multipool to mine whatever is most profitable, and convert to USD (either through straight to buyer sales or through exchanges), right now that's doge, but who knows after the halvening. I've done the math. Even if things go south I should be able to make my money back. Plus I've got the hard asset; 3 R9 290's, the RAM (mobo and cpu won't be worth squat, but meh). And by done the math I don't mean just using a calculator, I mean doing a linear regression to figure out the probable difficulty in 1 year based on trends and using that for calculating out profit. I'm in the clear. On the low end, the system should pay for itself in 1 quarter.

The thing is, other folks who thought it was a neat venture are hearing the news about MtGox and are starting to PM me about it that I'm heading into failure. I'm hearing "well aren't all of those coins the same?" constantly. I'm getting tired of explaining it to people. I've always been really good at divorcing myself from emotions when it comes to money things and letting the math guide me, but this time, they're starting to wear me down a bit. My wife especially. I don't know what I'm expecting to get out of this post, other than just some venting. Any thoughts or inspiring words shibes? 




 Just curious about this; I know that the satoshi is a fraction of a bitcoin, so we basically track the value of dogecoin against BTC. Is there a reason for that? 




 Well, I was set to have my rig built this afternoon, but then tigerdirect notified me that they don't actually carry stock anymore; they drop ship everything. Which sucks. They were the company I was going to get my power supply from.

So, I cancelled my order with them, and ordered from another company; rush processing, 2 day shipping. I got a call from them a few minutes ago that their shipment of power supplies never came in, but they expect it to be in on monday. Maybe.

So, as of today I have every single part except a power supply, and given that most places seem to have anywhere from a 2 week to 6 month backlog on 1500w power supplies, I'm annoyed. I was hoping to start mining before the halvening to get at least a few days of peak mining out of it. Boo.

There are no freys or microcenters nearby to check out, so it looks like I am stuck waiting.

I wish vendors would simply state whether or not they have an item. Not list it as available when they "expect a shipment to come in," or when "we think our 3rd party warehouse may have it available, maybe."

Such frustration. Many sad. 




 Well, how do you go about doing it? Right now I'm looking at both Vault of Satoshi and Coinbase. Coinbase will require me to trade doge for BTC (so there's a fee there at some exchange), and then on top of that they charge a percentage fee, and they tack on a .15 "bank fee." But I can withdraw anytime day or night to my business account.

Vault of Satoshi requires me writing them an email, hoping they respond, but it looks like that would be free if I just get a paper check. However, time could be a factor here since I was hoping to get at least a weekly payout.

I'm looking to mine 24x7, withdraw 98% of each day's take as USD daily, and then send the other remaining coins to cold storage wallets.

So, for those of you who do it, how do you manage to keep fees low? What has been your lowest-cost method of converting doge to USD? 




 Just curious - for all of you more experienced miners, is there a noticable difference between using Linux and Windows? What about power utilization?

I ask for two reasons:

* because it seems like doing things like tweaking card performance/voltage is significantly easier inside of windows, whereas with linux you're sort of stuck hoping your miner can make the changes which may or may not be possible.
* Windows tends to have way more processes running so it would make sense that it would be more power than a minimal linux install.

Any feedback would really be appreciated. 




 Hey everyone. So, 4 days ago I felt like I hit the lottery when I saw a 1500w power supply for sale at tigerdirect, and in stock! I placed the order, and waited.

Then I got an update: order submitted to drop shipper. WTF? Tigerdirect is drop shipping now? Seriously?

So, I've been waiting.
And waiting.
And waiting.
Still no update. Every time I call tigerdirect they say that the order is being handled by the drop shipper, and the drop shipper has to meet the same shipping timeframe. I paid for 3 day shipping. This is the third day.

I'd cancel my order, but everywhere I look there is a 2 week to SIX MONTH waiting period for power supplies. Does anyone have any idea where to purchase them? 









 Hey everyone! So, I'm trying to be objective with this post, so I'll do my best to stay away from opinion type things and stick with hard facts.

So, why do I think that dogecoin is here to stay? 

* **Transaction volume.** With only being around for 2 months, our community has already dwarfed the number of transactions that bitcoin or any other altcoin sees. The ultimate point of a crypto*currency* is for people to **use it**. The suggestion that bitcoin will be hoarded seems to be true; people don't seem to spend it that much. That's great, but if it doesn't get used, people don't have a reason to accept it for transactions. When is the last time you went into a store and saw someone pay with a gold coin? Still, people stock up on them. So what they've done is turn it into a commodity instead of a currency. There's nothing inherently good or bad about that, but part of what makes a crypto-currency work is people using it as, well, a currency.

* **Our community.** It's awesome. Simple as that. When I first heard about doge in december, I wrote it off as another fad on 4chan that would go away in 2-3 days, especially when I saw people throwing around tens of thousands of coins in a shot. Plus, that was paired with a lot of rhetoric about getting rich from people who didn't really seem to understand how currency exchange, or economics worked in general. But, here we are! And oh man, this community is driving it forward. People are using paper wallets to spread the word. People are getting businesses to accept Dogecoin. People are starting businesses to support the community. People are getting netted in with pervasive tipping. That all points to this digging in for the long haul. Add into that all of the charity, which I'll talk about more in the next point, and I think it all points to good things in the future. Every 10 minutes you see a new reddit thread about a new shibe coming to the community.

* **Our branding.** Originally, I thought it was silly to use a meme as the basis for a currency. The people who were evangelizing dogecoin kept saying that it would succeed because it's cute and appealing. I thought that it ultimately would be shrugged off as unprofessional by most of the world. To be honest, I still think that it may be eventually (maybe a rebrand of an epic Shibe standing on a cliff, a-la-Lion King), but for now I appear to be wrong. See, half of what made things like siri successful is the goofy stuff you can do with it ("do you love me siri?"). We've become like the counterpoint to the way-too-stern bitcoin community. Where they're talking about smashing iPhones and boycotting apple because an app was banned, we're talking about sending people to the Olympics, getting aide dogs for kids, and digging wells. We're raising awareness of ourselves not through advertising, but by being a genuine benevolent force in the world. That's really **REALLY** powerful. Plus, we've had a bunch of fun slogans which reel even more people in. TO THE MOON! It's a rallying cry! But more than anything, we have painted ourselves as a powerful force. *Let's do so much good that the world at large doesn't want us to go away.* We're already seeing newsprint in major sources - when's the last time another alt-coin has done that outside of a tech journal?

* **The developers.** Let's give them their due. They had an idea, and it took off. But they've also been able to make hard decisions when necessary. It took cojones of steel to make the hard decision to become inflationary currency. It took willingness to sacrifice part of the community that they were very aware would jump ship when the news hit. And, you know what? A bunch of folks did jump ship. But that's part of leadership - you have to be able to make hard decisions not just for yourself, but for your entire community. They've also decided that we should continue to be a force for social good, and I totally support that.

So, combine all of these things, and I think we've found the crypto-currency recipe for success. We just have to keep going and run the course... **TO THE MOON**!

TL;DR: I think we're here to stay because people are actively using the currency, our community is awesome, we have great branding, and our developers have cojones. 




 So, what would be a realistic number of doge mined daily using 3x Radeon R9 290's at around 900KH/s? I'm just curious what I can expect (approximately obviously) once my rig is finished ~monday. 




 So, I am waiting on 3 of these to arrive:
http://www.superbiiz.com/detail.php?name=AT-290TR4G

For the life of me though, I can't find any information about whether or not they're unlocked. When i get them, they'll be put in a rig, and run with BAMT. So, where can I go to find out whether they're unlocked? Will something tell me? Is unlocking important?

I'd really appreciate the help! 




 Simple question, which one is the better choice right now? This will be on a headless mining rig. The only big things I can see in the release notes for 13.10 are that there's additional GUI stuff, which, frankly, I don't really care about. But is there an updated kernel or anything that would make it preferred over the LTS? 




 Hey everyone. I'm going to be getting this MoBo for my mining rig tomorrow. I've read that a lot of motherboards need the 1x to have a jumper wire installed on the PCI slot to see anything in the 1x slot as a video card. Is that the case with these motherboards? 




 Just curious; I have had a heck of a time getting anything related to primecoin running on OSX. I finally managed to get a working miner and wallet using brew and the directions here:
http://www.reddit.com/r/primecoin/comments/1slc8q/primecoin_wallet_and_xolominer_pool_miner_for_osx/

This installs the primecoin wallet to /usr/local/Cellar/primecoin/0.1.2xpm.

But now I can't get the wallet to sync. Apparently there was an update recently, but you can forgo it if you modify Primecoin.conf. The problem is, from what I'm reading, Primecoin.conf doesn't exist by default. I can't find any documentation around about where it could or should be located on OSX.

So, I guess my question is twofold: 
*Why the lack of OSX love? There's a ton of documentation for linux and windows, but there's very little for OSX. 
*And where is primecoin.conf supposed to be located when you follow the instructions in that walkthrough?


Oh, and in case anyone wants to say a mac is "not a real computer" or whatever, I'm a telephony engineer for a fortune 500 telecom, and actively help write standards for the IETF. I'm also an RHCE. I know a real computer when I see one, trust me. 




 Hey! My new rig is using 3 of these GPUs:
http://www.superbiiz.com/detail.php?name=AT-290TR4G

According to their docs, it has an 8pin and 6pin power connector built into it. I ordered 2 normal 16x-16x PCI risers, and a single powered 1x-16x pci riser.

Since the GPU has its own power connection, can I just forgo connecting the power plug on the riser and use it like it was unpowered? This is the riser I bought:
http://www.amazon.com/Qody-PCI-E-Extension-Cable-powered/dp/B00FQJ077Q

Any feedback would be really helpful; I'm just trying to make sure I don't burn anything out. 














 Simple question; today I have had 4 deposits sent to cryptsy. Nothing seems to be showing up. For Doge, I can see the transactions in block explorer, but there's still no "transactions out." I know scrypt requires a bunch of verifications, but I've still usually received coins to my wallet within 10-15 minutes. 




 This is my first sale, so sorry about the low rep. I've had this game sitting in my inventory for years and it's time someone got to enjoy it! 




 Hello! So, I'm trying to figure out dogetipbot. The "answer a lot of repeated questions" post I found doesn't actually answer a lot of my questions... like, how do I start using it? How does it know where to send and receive dogecoins to/from? Is there a silly noob post explaining it?

I'm still kind of new to reddit, so, this may be something really easy that I'm just not getting, lol :) 




 Eep. Here's hoping it can pay for itself, or I'm going to owe a lot of explaining to the Mrs. So, here are the parts:

**video**
3x [Sapphire TRI-X AMD Radeon R9 290 OC](http://www.superbiiz.com/detail.php?p=AT-290TR4G c=pw hash=510dY3r8l1Wto8S1V8hVdR0jLFvVFgNtVEuY502sas2Zu%2B4yBhuoU3RRMm8Qu3IJXObxWaOMJp56fbOtRGb8pXEHIELDkrlpnAZIpwLfw39CDudlYy00KS1IXH8%2Feg) - Apparently the order includes a free gift of 3x [Sapphire AMD Radeon R7 240 2GB](http://www.superbiiz.com/detail.php?name=AT-R724BT2) - *$1,805*

**CPU, MEM, MOBO**
1x [AMD Sempron 145](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819103888)
1x [Kingston 4GB 240-Pin DDR3 1333](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820239309)
1x [MSI 970A-G43 AM3+](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813130679)
Total: *$167*

**Power**
1x [SilverStone Strider Series 1500w Modular Power Supply](http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=6624651) - *$365*

**Misc**
4x Risers (2 1-16x powered, 2 16x-16x), milk crate, kill-a-watt wall meter, ATX power switch,  16GB USB3 stick - *$125*

Original plan was for the 3x 290's, but if I get the free R7's as well, one of those will be going in too. The others will get resold.

Thoughts? Total came to around $2462. Assuming 4 cards, it should put out about 3000KH/s. 









 Hey everyone; I am looking to purchase a mining rig for mining Scrypt coins, but I'm trying very hard to ensure that I get a return on investment. However, I am very concerned about dumping the cash on several GPUs only to have ASICs suddently become widely available. With things like dualminer coming out, and now gridseed's product, what sort of threat do you think do they present to not just Doge, but all scrypt mining?

I have always read that Scrypt would be nearly impossible to mine with ASICs because memory usage can be increased to make them prohibitively expensive, but yet here they are starting to appear on market. 




 Hey everyone! Just trying to figure this out; dogecoin-qt has said for the past 8 hours or so that it's at 100% (or at least the little progress bar says so). However the wallet still says it's out of sync. I'm using osx mavericks... just not sure what's going on. Anyone else have experience with the dogecoin client on a mac? 




 Hey everyone, it's another one of those posts that you all love! This is meant to be a first foray into mining. I'm starting with 2 GPUs and scaling up from there. Ultimately I'd think this could handle up to 4.

* Motherboard:
MSI 970A-G43 AM3+ AMD 970 SATA 6Gb/s USB 3.0 ATX

I'll be running xubuntu off the USB storage. Any suggestions on tweaks? This brings the price to about $1584 with an estimated 1600 KH/s based on the hardware comparisons I've seen. I'm also estimating power should be around 600w at the wall? Should I look into a larger power supply? Any feedback would be appreciated.

This box will be sitting in my basement on my workbench chugging away 24x7x365 (hopefully). 




 Hey everyone. I am new to litecoin mining, and I'm trying to do the math to see whether or not it is worth it to get started. I am using this calculator:
http://www.coinwarz.com/calculators/litecoin-mining-calculator

Assumptions:
I'm assuming purchasing 3 HD7990's (I work for a large telecom company and can likely get better deals than the average joe), but I'm assuming a hardware cost of $4k and a hash rate of 3000 KH/s.
I'm assuming a 1250 watt power supply, and our power costs $0.11/kWh.
I'm assuming a 1% pool fee (I don't have a pool picked out yet).
I've kept the default block reward of 50 because I'm too new to figure out quite how this works.

Calculations:
For difficulty, I took the chart and history here:
http://bitcoinwisdom.com/litecoin/difficulty
and did some number crunching. I defined X as the number of days since 8/15/2013, and Y as the difficulty.
First, I figured out the slope and intercept based on those numbers.
Based on the data listed, the slope comes out to approximately 17.9 difficulty/day, and the intercept is at 306. Then it was just a matter of plugging it into slope-intercept form (y=m*x+b), where x is 535 days (the number of days between february 1, 2015 and 8/15/2013) which gave me a difficulty of 9884 one year from now.
I did a linear regression and the math seems to jive.

ROI:
So that's what I popped in to the calculator. Using these numbers, it is showing a profit of approximately $1.4k over the year. Since this is basing the entire year off of what the difficulty is estimated at a year from now, it could potentially be much more (current difficulty is around 2500).

So, does this math seem correct? I'm trying to be conservative because I'm showing it to the Mrs to justify why I'd be spending it. Any feedback would be helpful.

Also, this is assuming only litecoin is mined, and no money is sunk into ASIC mining devices if/when they come out.

 Hey everyone. As of this morning, thanks to an idiot HIT requestor, my approval rating is down to 98.1%. I took several of their HITs, in which you had to identify "objectionable" images. They included a warning which stated there would be between 20-50 objectionable images in the lot, and if you selected more than 50, you would have your hit rejected.

So I ended up being presented with about 5 hits, each with scores of penis pictures (no joke). Each one had tons of "objectionable" images based on the requestors requirements, so there was no way to supply the required information without exceeding their 50 image threshold. As of this morning, I logged in to find out every single one had been rejected; each one stating "you missed N different images." So, not only would I have had to flag 70+ images on each HIT, but I would have had to go directly against their warning. Since i'm new to HWTF and a lot of the mturk lists, I wasn't familiar with TO until last evening; now I see the requestor has horrible ratings across the board.

So, any advice on how to pump back up my approval rating? Some 1 cent HITS that take a second to do would be the best I suppose? 




 Exactly what the title says. I am still new to using SB, and I've been looking into ways to get it to run automatically (experience with *nix, so I've had some ideas but was hoping to find something canned). I have seen lots of posts about SB not running correctly in daemon mode on OSX ML, but most of the posts are a year+ old. Is this still an issue? Looking through the changelog didn't have any clues. 




 Hi everyone. I have been going nuts trying to solve this. I want to use Rosetta stone on a mac mini, which sits in my entertainment center functioning as a HTPC. To do this, I need a wireless sound input device. I don't need sound output - I am using the HDMI port and outputting sound directly to my TV. That all works fine. I just can't find a wireless input solution. I have tried an old pair of Dell BH200 bluetooth headphones which used to work just fine for this purpose 3 years ago, but apparently the bluetooth stack is less versatile now.

I had my job purchase me a plantronics M165 bluetooth headset, and it does pair properly with the mac. But the aggressive power saving that it uses causes the microphone to stop working after 2-3 seconds of silence. So, when rosetta stone attempts to open the sound input channel (repeat the word after me sort of situation), it suddenly sees the device as offline. Approximately half the time, it causes rosetta stone to freeze up, or spit out an error and force close.

I don't know what to do. Apple has been no help whatsoever on this. The only wireless microphones I can find that aren't bluetooth cost well over 150$ and are designed for conferencing.

All I have been getting are suggestions to use a USB mic, or a wired mic. That will be incredibly messy in the living room (the last thing I need is another wire in the entertainment center, especially one that can stretch across the entire room). Is this really such a weird use case? 




 Hey everyone. I recently purchased a late '12 Mac Mini to serve as a HTPC. So far, it has worked great. However one of the goals was to use it as a hub for family software and distance learning (stuff like Rosetta stone, and some distance language classes). The goal is to remain completely wireless (would you really want to be tethered by a wired microphone 3 inches from a 51" plasma screen? Those things get HOT!). I have an apple magic mouse, a logitech k760 keyboard and they both work great with bluetooth.

The issue is sound IO. I need sound to go out of the mac mini via HDMI to my TV. This works just great. But sound input? That's an issue. I haven't been able to track down a non-bluetooth wireless mic that is less than 150$. If I want to go below that, I have to use bluetooth. That's great, except apparently there are a ton of issues with the bluetooth stack in Lion and Mountain Lion, many of which directly impact bluetooth audio IO. I can pair a wireless headset in stereo mode, but the instant I try to activate the mic in the sound input pref pane, I receive a "your bluetooth device has encountered an error" dialog. This happens in both Mountain Lion and Lion.

Thinking it could be because I am using an older headset (3.5 whole years! a Dell Bh200 stereo headset), I had work order me a new bluetooth earbud - a plantronics a170 headset. This is the same one apple sells. I connect it to my mac and it works great - until I try to activate the mic. As soon as I do, spinning beachball, and then error.

Looking at the apple discussion forums, there are hundreds of threads about bluetooth issues (like this one: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3200456?start=0 tstart=0), but no comprehensive solution, and the overall consensus seems to be that the apple bluetooth stack is a cluster****. 

Suggestions from apple geniuses were hilarious - "the bluetooth device is broken!" So I paired it with windows, a blackberry, and an android. "There aren't any known issues with the bluetooth stack in OSX." So I showed them several 20+ page discussions on their own discussion boards. "You aren't using an apple supported bluetooth device!" So I did the same demo with the Plantronics headset and showed them the place where it is sold on their site. "You need to purchase an iSite webcam with a built in mic!" Um, no. Bad fanboy, no skinnyjeans.

So, after much research, one of the suggestions was using an aftermarket bluetooth dongle, which should shut off the internal bluetooth adapter on the mac. Why would you want to do this? The internal bluetooth adapter has several key bluetooth device profiles missing in mountain lion and lion, like handsfree. An external adapter should include support for all of them. If that's true, it may resolve my issues.

The internal adapter is a Broadcom BCM20702. I'd like to use a 4.0 dongle for future-proofing, but the only known mac-compatible one I have found that isn't completely documented in Chinese is from IOGear. The chipset it uses? Broadcom BCM20702A0. So, same chipset, possibly a different firmware update. Most likely it will exhibit the same problems. There is also an iogear bluetooth 2.1+EDR but I can't find any explanation of the chipset.
2.1+EDR should work for the magic mouse, keyboard, and both of the bluetooth headsets, I just need to know that the devices won't have any issues pairing after coming out of sleep (it is a HTPC and needs to be easy for the fiancee to use, that includes devices waking up).

I am left with a ton of questions and almost no answers -

-Can I use a mono bluetooth headset JUST as a mic, while using the normal audio out for sound?

-If not, are there any wireless microphones available for less than 100$ that are known to work?

-Do you think the wireless dongle hardware will exhibit the same issues if I pick up the IOgear 4.0 one?

-Is there any way to add additional bluetooth profiles to the built in bluetooth adapter?

-Is this really THAT weird of a use case? Wireless audio input? Why is it this hard? 
























 So I am playing through the lessons and I simply cannot get 100 percent on any of the practice tracks. Specifically, once I get up to the 12th fret and higher rocksmith has a really hard properly recognizing notes.

For instance, in the shifting lesson, it asked me to play the 15th fret. So I did. It kept complaining that I was hitting the 16th fret. I had to play the 14th fret to pass that part.

It is especially bad in the sustain track because it simply refuses to acknowledge that I have hit the 12th fret notes at all unless I pick the string way harder than should really be necessary.

I have my pickup selector set to the neck pickup. I have the pickup volume the whole way up. I have increased the line in input in my mixer settings. I have recalibrated and retuned (both with rocksmith as well as my snark clip on tuner). I've tried tuning at both the neck and the 12th fret (guitar geek tip - tune by playing at the 12th fret). Everything should be working. But it isn't. 

Anyone else run into this?? 




 I just noticed this a few minutes ago. I had planned on getting my parents a gift card for christmas, and I realized that they don't seem to be available at either site anymore.

Did I miss the memo, or is there a system down somewhere or what? 




 Pretty simple question I hope. I have been dying for black pudding but for the life of me I can't find it in the US. I have decided to make it for myself.

However out of 3 butchers, 0 would sell me pig blood. One told me it is illegal to sell. That sounds... strange.

I found an ethnic Asian market that sells it frozen, but I know ethnic markets can sometimes play a little fast and loose with legality. Not that I care if they have what I need, lol.

So, does anyone know? Is it really illegal to sell pig blood in the US? 




 What the title says.

We use capital one 360 and have one checking and a ton of savings accounts (its how we handle budgeting).

I know if I transfer out of a savings account to checking it counts toward the monthly limit, but I don't believe I have ever seen a notice when transferring between savings accounts. 




 Hey everyone! I'm in the process of planning out my wife and I's first at-home Christmas dinner. We got tired of figuring out whose family/friends/whatever we were supposed to attend each year and decided to just spend it together.

As of now I'm working on putting together the menu. Obviously this is a special meal so I am going all out.

Appetizer:
??

Lemon sorbet in between

Main course:

* Crown rack of lamb
* Couscous with nuts, fruit
* garlic custard
* asparagus bundles tied with bacon

Cheese plate: 

* Roquefort or stilton
* Cabot clothbound cheddar
* Camembert
* Some TBD hard cheese
* Some TBD chevre or sheep milk cheese

Dessert:
Chocolate mousse, a lemon curd tart, creme brulee or a tart tatin and espresso

Wine pairing:
* cote du rhone
* Chateau Ste Michelle Eroica (her favorite)

So, I have most of it planned out. There are a few things TBD the one I am having the most trouble with is the appetizer.

I know traditionally it should be a soup or salad. I'd like to go a bit beyond a salad, so I'm trying to think of soups. 

Any suggestions? Any other ideas for apps that would fit? 




 Pretty simple question. It's nice enough that Rocksmith shows you hand positioning, but some songs seem to have kind of wonky finger positioning that doesn't really make sense with the positioning. 

It seems like tremolos show you the finger, but otherwise it doesn't really seem to help too much. 




 So, I've always had an issue with the occasional muscle spasm. Usually it's minor, and it doesn't happen frequently. But every now and then I'll be practicing and one of my fingers will have a single solitary "twitch."

Now, i've never been to a doctor for it because it is pretty seldom, but it does seem to happen more often when I'm using my hands - like when I'm playing guitar.

So, does anyone else have this problem? How have you overcome it? Thus far it hasn't really impacted my practicing, but I'd love to understand what it is and how to ensure it never does impact my practicing. 




 Hey everyone. I grabbed CDLC for 21st Century Digital Boy (bad religion), which was PC only. I used the toolkit to convert to mac.

At the song select screen, the song shows up. The music plays. When I select the song, the "rocksmith recommends" stuff all shows up properly, tuning shows up, etc. When I press play, if it's the first song, the tuner will show up. If i'm already in standard E, it won't.

At this point through something weird happens. The foreground graphics all fade away, leaving just the background (and the amp stacks on the sides of the screen). Then it just sits there. Hitting escape/enter/whatever doesn't work. The game stays responsive, but it just sits there with no way to escape.

I've had to force quit trying it 4 times now, so it's definitely repeatable. Could it be an issue with the CDLC? Or maybe something went wrong during the conversion from PC to Mac? It's the only one I've had an issue with so far! 




 Hey everyone. This is impacting me on both Classical and Electric guitar. During warmups and initial practice my fret hand has no issues. For classical, my thumb placement is exactly where it should be, behind the second fret (first position). I'm sitting correctly, guitar in my lap at a 10 degree angle (ish) learning in to my body and at an ascending angle.

With electric, my position is a bit more sloppy and relaxed. Usually I'm sitting on a couch or chair and playing whatever feels most comfortable at the time (the electric is more for fun and less for serious study for me right now).

Either way, after about 30 minutes or so, my fret hand starts to ache. I find myself squeezing the fretboard a lot, so I'm wondering if this is causing it?

My classical guitar teacher has suggested letting gravity pull my hand down on to the string as opposed to exerting force, but when i do that I tend to get buzzing more than clear notes. He also suggested bringing my fret hand's arm's elbow tighter in to my body, but still, not much improvement. Other than that, he said my form is fine. So I'm kind of at a loss.

I'm a relatively new player - about 6 months, so could this just be simple muscle fatigue that will go away? Is there something else I could be doing wrong? Any other ideas would be really appreciated. Usually I can just shake out my hand and it goes away, but there have been a few times where it has caused me to cut my practicing a bit short. Since I've been practicing more and more lately, it has been limiting me more and more. 




 A buddy is letting me long-term-borrow his fender deluxe player strat. There are the 3 pickup knobs, and the normal pickup selector switch. There is also a button which has no label. Since it's used, there's no guide with the guitar. For the life of me, I can't find anything on google other than it controls pickups. I don't know what it does exactly.

The official fender blurb says: "The powerful Deluxe Players Strat guitar is set apart from the pack by features [...] standard five-way pickup switch paired with push/push mini-switch offering an even greater variety of pickup combinations, brown shell pickguard and gold-plated vintage hardware."

Which, is great for saying what it's supposed to do, but how the heck does it work? So, can anyone help an ignorant newbie? :) 




 Hey everyone. I have been taking classical fingerstyle lessons for about 6 months now, and feel somewhat accomplished with it.

I have been planning to start dabbling in rock and jazz for awhile (I figured learning rock and jazz with the full knowledge of theory behind it would be awesome). A buddy is letting me long-term-borrow his fender strat to start doing just that. Well, as a gift my wife picked me up RS2014, and I now have it fully decked out. The thought was it would give me the ability to practice stuff that isn't from the book, let me start playing around with other styles, and most importantly keep the guitar in my hand.

I have no plan to stop taking lessons.

So, who else out there takes guitar lessons in addition to playing RS? Are there any teachers or students out there who can provide information or tips about this approach? I want to play with both, but I don't want to sabotage my lessons. I want RS to be an enhancement to my learning.

My guess is I need to focus a lot on the guitarcade because it doesn't so much teach songs as it does teach techniques that are always important. The songs should just be a fun addition. What does everyone else think? 




 So, I've been messing with the guitarcade in RS2014, but I'm getting kind of frustrated that to learn, I play through (but usually fail pretty fast).

The problem is, after I lose, I have to watch the losing animation, watch a game over screen, watch a high scores screen, go to the title screen, "make some noise," wait for opening animations, etc.

Is there any way I can skip all of that stuff and get right back to gameplay? It's annoying having 45 seconds of downtime between each attempt. 




 Pretty much what I put in the title. I've been studying fingerstyle for awhile, and had an opportunity pop up to get an Fender Strat (a buddy is considering selling it, but isn't sure if he really wants to, so I am "long term borrowing" while he decides if he can live without it or not).

This works for me, because in a few months I want to pick up a hollowbody to start venturing more into Jazz and rockabilly.

So, now I have this thing, I don't know where to go first. I tried fingerpicking but it started gouging the hell out of my nails, so I'll be picking up some new alaska piks soon. Are there any good books for jazz that I can start with? This is less serious study and more for fun, so I'd love to hear everyone's opinions. Something for jazz fingerpicking would be spectacular because it's what I'm most comfortable with. 




 Pretty much exactly what the title says. What do you find yourself buying most often? Picks? Reeds? Strings? Cork oil? Cables?

I want to start with basics musicians always need, and then eventually start moving towards larger items (things that are tough and expensive to build up an inventory of initially). 




 As of this evening I'm borrowing a buddy's Les Paul studio that he never plays (he is considering selling it but isn't sure, and figures it will give him a chance to see if he really never uses it if I long-term-borrow). It gives me a chance to futz around on an electric before I make the jump on a hollowbody next year.

Pretty simple question - does anyone know of a current deal on RS2014 for pc/mac? I know I'm a week late, but maybe someplace still has a cyber-week sale going on.

If I can find the core game, I'll order one of the cables separately. Otherwise I'll be ordering the physical bundle. 




 It arrived yesterday. My wife and I have been fed up with replacing 1 to 2 coffee machines a year for years, and getting consistently terrible support.

So, we figured the time had come, so we took advantage of the 20% sale at Williams-Sonoma and placed our order.

My first impressions - I like how it's built. While it will be a pain in the ass for folks who hate washing small parts, for kitchen clean freaks like the wife and I, it's awesome. It also shows you what you're paying for - a crazy pump and heating element, with some well designed plastic parts to hold and drip coffee through.

I had the first brew this morning, and I had mixed results. I made enough for 10 cups of coffee, using their guideline of 7tbsp (usually we each have 2 mugs of coffee a morning, and measuring it out with water that was about what was needed). The coffee came out surprisingly timid taste-wise (not the coffee maker's fault, I have to dial it in). I used a paper filter instead of a mesh filter, so the mouthfeel was slightly diminished from what I'm used to. I'll pick up a new filter today.

Despite the first pot being a little light, I will say that it packed a hell of a punch of caffeine. I had to be up for work at 4:30, and about 10 minutes after finishing my travel mug I got a very noticable jolt. I weigh 230 lbs. That almost never happens with coffee, especially cheap bulk beans from sams club (I don't use "the good stuff" until I have it dialed in). This could have been psychosomatic, but it was noticable to me.

So far, I am very impressed, I just have to dial in the right amount of coffee to use. It looks great, albiet a little industrial.  I also like the 5 year guarantee - at the rate we were replacing pots this alone makes the ticket price worth it. 




 Hey everyone. Like lots of folks, I got involved with cryptocurrency during the boom last december. However, much of the time between then, and honestly, even now, I was flying by the seat of my pants and guiding myself with back-of-napkin math. I didn't keep much in the way of records.

Since getting involved, a number of the parties I've worked with have shuttered their doors, gone bankrupt, or worse (gone rogue resulting in lots of losses that I've more or less shrugged off). With these places closing their doors, I've lost the ability to get records of the transactions to/from them. I still earn some bitcoin weekly through online mining contracts.

So, my issue is I'd like to try and comply with the IRS advisory, but I simply lack most of the records I would need to comply. I'm not really sure what to do. Part of me wants to take the paltry sum of bitcoin that I have now (as in this moment, it's small, about $200 USD) and set it aside, and start keeping immaculate records.

The benefit of doing that is I can start freely converting some of my earnings back to USD so long as I pay taxes on the capital gains/losses, which is a good thing right? If I am correct - I pay taxes on the income the day that the bitcoin is received, and then if it is held, I pay taxes on the capital gains between the day it is received and the day it is used for another financial transaction.

However, I haven't been able to get any real information about how to do my taxes. What forms do I need? Usually I do my taxes with turbotax, but I'm guessing that is out of the question? For a non-tax-pro, the whole advisory is really confusing and I don't really know where to begin if I want to go "green field" and start keeping immaculate records.

I just need advice about what to do and how to best proceed. I've tried starting a conversation about this in /r/bitcoin but the majority of folks there just say not to bother which is counterproductive. I've also seen folks say to talk to a tax attorney or cpa but the prices in our area dwarf the amount ive earned significantly. 




 So, I've been playing with cryptos for a little over a year now. The issue I have is that in that time, I didn't keep good records. I don't know how much I mined, how much I sent where, etc. Worse, there is a lot that I have lost in places like Gox and Bitcoin-Trader. I can't get records from them. Likewise a number of the altcoin pools I was participating in have dried up and closed their doors, so I can't account for my transactions from them.

All said, I honestly don't know how to handle the taxes.

So, what I'm considering doing is sending everything I currently have to a paper wallet, and starting to keep detailed records from that day forward (kind of a "green field" approach). At least then I can be somewhat in compliance. Is this a good/bad idea? I'm in the US and the reporting requirements are confusing to say the least. 




 Hey everyone!
Hopefully this is my last pre-purchase question. I'm pretty sure I'm getting rocksmith and rocksmith 2014, but now I'm torn between PS3 and PC.

PS3 seems like it is the easiest to get up and running. PC, by nature of being a more open platform, should give me more versatility - stuff like custom DLC (I really want more jazz stuff to be included, and this seems like the only option).

Are there any other major differences I need to be aware of between the two?? 




 Hey everyone. I am interested in picking up ricksmith and rocksmith 2014. I am currebtly studying classical guitar, but I feel that this could help me pick up the guitar a bit morw and in a different way.

I have seen several articles mention that in rocksmith 2014 you can pay to download the song library from the original rocksmith if you have it already.

Does this require that I have a copy of the original rocksmith? Or can I just buy rocksmith 2014 and download the original rocksmith's song library as dlc?

This is for PS3 




 Simple question I hope. I am re-outfitting my GT Transeo 2.0 to be a training bike. As part of that, I picked up a lower end cycle computer that had gotten thumbs up for rear mounting.

Now, I'm having a hell of a time getting the spedometer sensor to work correctly. My bike uses disk brakes, so the chainstays and seatstays are extremely wide. According to the manufacturer, the spoke magnet and the sensor have to pass within 1-3mm of each other (2 business cards thickness). There simply is no where on the frame of my bike where that is possible. Even at the hub (if the disk brakes weren't blocking me from putting it there) there is still about a half inch between the magnet and the sensor.

The only place I've found that gets the sensor close enough to the spoke magnet is on the sheathing to the brake line right before it goes into the disk brake mechanism. If I mount the sensor there, it finally is close enough to the magnet that it can pick it up. My major concern is that the zip ties will restrict movement of the brake line.

I am also considering beefing up the magnet by using some neodymium magnets - i just have to find a way to hold them. 














 Over the weekend I picked up a several games. The Jak and Daxter collection, The Ratchet and Clank collection, Rayman Origins and Rayman Legends, Lego Hobbit, and GTA5. Well over the 100$ requirement. However I haven't seen anything from Sony about the credit they promised for spending over 100$. 




 Hey everyone!
My wife, for christmas, is getting me a set of rollers for my bike. She let me know, so we can pick them out together. Right now I'm looking at Elite Atrion mag rollers. It's on sale at Performance Bicycle for black friday, and it seems like a good option. Has anyone

Truth is, I've got a sedentary job, and I've gained about 55lbs since I started working there 5 years ago. I've been trying to lose weight. We have a very good treadmill, but I seriously can't stand running anymore (I've run 2 half marathons, my knees can't take it with the weight, and my mind can't take the boredom). I can get an OK workout by walking/wogging on the treadmill, but I just enjoy my bike more.

I have a GT Transeo 2.0 hybrid with the stock tires. I've been told that the tires will work, but I should look at getting some smooth tires. Is there any truth to that?

I'm also thinking about getting some kind of cycle computer to monitor cadence/speed, but what other features should I look at? I feel like GPS would be wasted because I won't be using the computer while I'm outside riding. What other training specific features would be helpful? Are there any models anyone can recommend? For heart rate, I've got a Polar F11 (it's old but it works great). 




 Well, our turkey cooked far faster than expected for a 23lb bird. It is now done nearly 2 hours earlier than expected.

Will storing it in a cooler dry things out? 




 This is something that has been bothering me for awhile - why do so many people make the assumption that women cook and men don't? What defines our biases associated with foods and who we think is "good" at making them?
 
I'll give an example. I spent all day making a series of dishes for a community meeting. Everything 100% from scratch, slow food style, so when I say from scratch I mean as close to scratch as I can reasonably come. Stromboli with homemade mozz, sauce, homegrown veggies, home ground sausage, etc. The yeast was the only thing that came in a package. Fruit leathers from berries I picked. Cupcakes filled with home brewed chocolate stout cream. Things that took a long time and a ton of effort.

I show up to the meeting, and the first response I hear after "this is amazing!" is "Please tell your wife this food was awesome!" I was fit to be tied.

We regularly have pot lucks at work, and it happens there too. Muesli cookies? Apple pie from hand picked apples and home milled flour and home churned butter crust? Vanilla bourbon salt caramels? Again, people seem incredulous that I, not my wife, made it. "You made this!?"

It feels like a huge slap in the face. Yes I freaking made it! Spending hours tweaking something to get it perfect only to have someone assume that you didn't do it because you have a penis really, really sucks. I am exacting with cooking. I have a deep sense of pride in what I cook. I'm passionate about it. If I could do it all over,  I'd have gone into the CIA. So it feels horrible when I get that doubtful "yeah, right" look after I explain that my wife didn't make something.

I just don't get it. People love celeb chefs like Alton Brown, Robert Irvine, Bobby Flay, and more. So why do so many people on the whole seem to assume that men generally cannot cook?

The crazy thing is, there is an inverse to this. If it is grilled or bbq, the assumption is I'm the one responsible, even though my wife is excellent at grilling.

Has anyone else experienced this? How pervasive are these biases? 




 I've wanted one for about 2 years. After wrecking yet another candy thermometer and knowing that I have a massive thanksgiving meal to cook on the horizon, I dug deep and placed the order.

I just got the notice from fedex that it was delivered today.

So, anyone else out there have a thermopen? How do you like it? The reviews are all glowing, but I'd love to know more about how well it has worked for you. 




 Hey everyone. I'm taking advantage of the 1$ galaxy S5's from Best Buy this week to upgrade my wife and I's phones. We are eligible for upgrades as of july of this year, so that isn't a concern.

We currently have 2 lines on an unlimited data plan (the one you can't get anymore). According to best buy, they will just renew the current contract. However when we started stepping through the process online, they say they will just renew the current plan but CONDITIONS MAY APPLY. But no where on the website does it list any kind of conditions, so we haven't pulled the trigger online. We're going to the store tonight instead.

So, does anyone have any idea what those conditions are? Will they force me out of my unlimited data plan as a condition? 




 Hopefully this is a quick, simple question. What is the effective difference between a traditional cleaver and a straight back cleaver ? I can't tell if the curved blade near the front would be helpful or hurt the my normal usage of a cleaver (hacking up carcasses). 

I mean, no front point SHOULD make the second one less likely to be damaged, right?

Examples:

Traditional: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001505OT6

Straight back: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005CFSMVM
 




 Hey everyone. I would like to try my hand at making a tofu press. I was thinking something simple like this:
http://www.amazon.com/EZ-Tofu-Press-Removes-Texture/dp/B007LLGMG2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1416623778 sr=8-1 keywords=tofu+press

What I was wondering about - what would be a good wood for this? End grain like you would use for a butcher block? It's going to be exposed to prolonged periods of pressure against a wet food surface. What kind of finish would work and be safe? 




 I am lucky enough to be very good friends with the son of one of the founders of Ithaca hours. For those who are not familiar, check out the wiki:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ithaca_Hours

The short version - it is a local currency that had had a very large amount of local buy-in from businesses.

I was thinking - wouldn't this be a great model not just for bitcoin, but also for any crypto in general? If bitcoin could start being evangelized at a local level similar results should be attainable, right? Thoughts? 

It seems like a natural fit - all of the usability of a local currency with a high amount of buy-in, PLUS it would be accepted worldwide. 




 Hey everyone!
For a fun little project, I am trying to build a simple little prank circuit comprised of a power supply, a photoresistor, and a piezo buzzer. The idea will be to lay some white tape on the floor, and attach the circuit (in a small project box) to the underside of the chair. This way when the chair rolls over the white line, it makes a buzz.

Now, my question is - how sensitive is a photoresistor? Suppose this circuit is underneath a rolling chair - it will be shading the floor. Is there a better way to detect the white tape? 




 Basically what the subject says.

This year we stocked up on fresh cheap turkeys thanks to the holiday sales, and I spent the past hour breaking them down (nothing fancy, just removing the wings, removing and splitting the legs and thighs, deboning the thighs, and removing the boneless breasts, bagging the carcasses for stock). The legs will probably get turned into pulled turkey, the thighs are going to get stuffed and wrapped in bacon. The breasts will get brined and smoked in the smoker (I'm considering making turkey pastrami but I'm concerned about it getting dry). The wings got set aside - we're using them to make our thanksgiving stuffing.

That said - the real point of this post is - does anyone else find breaking down an animal really therapeutic? Almost zen-like? I'm entirely self taught, but it feels almost like if you "tune out" your hands just innately know where to go. Maybe tune-out is the wrong way to put it because I'm paying 100% attention, but, hopefully I'm getting my point across.

Obviously I'm not breaking down beef primals yet, but I'd love to give it a go one day.

So, does anyone else feel the same way?? 




 Pretty much the subject.

We get Merrick Grain Free duck for our greyhound, and he seems to enjoy it. Via amazon, we were getting it, with tax, for about $47 a bag. The same bag has gone up $9 over 1 month BEFORE tax. We thought it may have just been Amazon, but it seems like every store has seen an increase.

We started looking through other premium brands and saw that prices seem to be up across the board.

Is this a permanent thing? Is it a temporary shortage of some ingredients...? I love our dog, but his food budget is now larger than my wife and I's food budget. 




 Pretty much the situation described in the subject. My wife and I are both 30. We are starting to discuss the possibility of trying to have a baby in the next year. I am currently in my open-enrollment period at work, and have the option to sign up for an FSA. We have no major medical expenses, and only currently purchase vitamins and calcium supplements for my wife.

I'm considering signing up for the flexible spending account and putting 10$ out of each paycheck into it for things like prenatal vitamins, but my concern is that at the end of the year, if we aren't successful, that's essentially money we lose.

So, any insights would be very much appreciated. 




 The subject should sum this up. We're taking advantage of the seasonal prices for 2 fresh turkeys which I'm breaking down into boneless breasts, thighs, and legs to be frozen for future use. The back and rest of the carcass will be boiled down with some chicken carcasses we have frozen for poultry stock.

For the cuts goal will most likely be to thaw and smoke them in the BBQ.

So, is it best to brine before freezing, or brine after freezing the birds? 




 See the subject.
I see tons of the hollowbodies without tremolo for both right and lefty. However the Tim Armstrongs with tremolo only seem to be available for lefties. Is this true, or am I somehow missing the right-handed ones with tremolos? 




 Pretty much the subject. I'm not used to using mobile wallets. I am using one of the HD wallet addresses, and I'm noticing it changes ~once per week. What concerns me is that I'll send a large amount there right after it changes and I'll end up sending bitcoin into the aether.

So, is this how it's supposed to work? Is it a feature of an HD wallet? Is there something I'm missing? Do the old addresses keep working?

Totally newbie questions I'm sure, but I'd love to get an explanation. 




 Hey everyone! So, I'm in the market to purchase a new guitar over the next few months. I'd love to do it with bitcoin, even if it means buying a gift card.

I was looking at amazon as a possible route, but they don't set up guitars for you, and I don't want to spend cash to have it done when it arrives.

I saw that amazon sells Guitar Center gift cards, but they're physical cards in $25 or $50 denominations. I would be kinda ludicrous to go into the store with 20 gift cards, you know?

So are there any places like guitarcenter/musician's friend/dave phillips etc that accept bitcoin? 




 Hey everyone! I was just wondering if anyone had heard anything about the sprint black friday deals this year? I haven't heard anything at all, and usually they'd be published by now. 




 Hey everyone. I've been a sprint customer since 1999, and have basically just been moving from plan to plan inside sprint. My wife and I are now on the same plan for the past 2-3 years.

2 black fridays ago we picked up 2 galaxy S3's (I only buy new phones on black friday since they got rid of the technology upgrade credits and sprint premier benefits). They're starting to get older and clunkier.

Does anyone know if there are going to be black friday specials this year?? Usually they would have been posted by now. 




 Hey everyone. I have an idea for a store to sell products for bitcoin. I wanted to start putting it online, but I am not really familiar with e-commerce solutions.

Initially I will be accepting cryptos, but eventually I would like to start accepting fiat as well.

So, how does it work exactly? Do I just set up any old e-commerce solution? Do payment providers act like plugins?

Sorry if these are newbie questions, but I've never done this sort of design before and I'm a little nervous. 




 Hey everyone! I've been studying classical fingerstyle for the past 6 months, and have really been enjoying it (plus the guys at /r/classicalguitar are really awesome).

Eventually I want to branch into jazz a bit (I still have a lot of learning, but I want to set aside cash so I can get a really nice instrument when I'm ready for it). However, that's where it starts to get a bit fuzzy because I don't know a heck of a lot about steel string guitars.

What would be best to learn on? I mean, Django played on an acoustic. BB King plays on an electric. So, it seems like I've got a ton of options and could really go the acoustic route (which I'm already used to from my classical guitar) OR the electric route (I'd probably be leaning towards a nice semi-hollowbody). Or do I want an acoustic with a resonator? I just don't know!

So, for those who have more experience than me, what would you view as preferable for learning jazz?  









 Hey everyone. Yet another noobie question :)

So, my wife (a professional music teacher) and my classical guitar teacher both tell me that I should try to avoid practicing much more than 30 minutes at a time. This almost never happens - by the time I am done doing hand exercises and warm ups, 15 minutes has usually already passed and I usually end up spending another 45 minutes on material and I still don't feel like I'm mastering it between lessons.

But both the Parkening and Provost books mention practicing for 3 or more hours a day. This is almost impossible given my schedule, but I do feel like I accomplish way more when I can set aside 2+ hours at a time to just work through the material over and over and over at ever-increasing tempos. Is it better to split that large block into several smaller ones?

What is the better approach? A few minutes a day or hours a day? Which will help the material "stick" more? 




 Hey everyone. I am looking to buy a PSMO to break down into filets and a chateaubriand roast. As of last night we scored a great deal on a membership to Sam's club off living social (deal may still be going, it's 45$ for the membership, a 20$ gift card, and 4 vouchers for free items - a rotisserie chicken, 2 baguettes, some dip, and some cookies). I figured this was a golden opportunity to break down some loins.

I went to the butcher case and only saw "beef loins." They had a nice heavy layer of fat so i couldn't see whether or not the chain muscle was attached. So, does anyone know if this is a PSMO or not? They were priced around $70-$90 which would seem about the right price range. There wasn't anyone working the butcher area that I could bounce questions off of. I know BJ's used to actually call them PSMOs so I'm a bit lost here. 




 So, I haven't played Destiny for close to a month. I played through the single player, and ran through each of the strikes. I'm not part of a guild or clan or anything, and due to lack of ability to really communicate meaningfully in game, I couldn't find one in the game. I wasn't looking to have to have 2+ screens open at all time just to play a single game, so I kinda lost interest and stopped playing. So, I just wanted to check in on the status of the game.

First, is there more content, or a better story yet? Or is Rasputin still a seemingly major plot point that is instantly forgotten the instant you leave earth? Does the dude in the Tower now tell you about all of the things he says he COULD tell you about?

Second, is playing the same strikes over and over and over still being masqueraded as content, or have they actually added real beefy content?

Third, have they added any kind of matchmaking to raids to allow players who aren't in clans/guilds to actually have a chance at seeing the content?

Fourth, have they made drop rates any better on blue and better gear so I don't have to run the same strikes/crucible matches 100 times a week to progress in the game?

Fifth, is RNG still as big of a PITA?

Sixth and last - can I finally talk to people for matchmaking? Or do I still have to rely on outside sources like destinylfg for something that should have been included in-game in the first place (based on the feedback received in both alpha and beta)?

Maybe these seem a bit snarky, but they really killed my enjoyment of this game and I'd genuinely like to know if they've been addressed. 




 Another newbie question - right now I am using my wife's electric piano's built in metronome, but it bottoms out at 40bpm. My snark has a visual metronome, but again it bottoms out at 40bpm. In fact, most of the metronomes I've found seem to bottom out at 40bpm.

For some of the pieces I am having a lot of trouble with, 40bpm is simply still too fast.

So, does anyone have a metronome that goes slower that they'd mind sharing? 




 Hey everyone. I've been taking lessons for about 2-3 months now, and I feel like I've made real progress. We're following the Christopher Parkening method book, and it seems to be moving at a decent pace (though I will admit when you start getting to pieces like Melancholia I just can't seem to play fast enough for the piece to sound decent, and my hands still don't move around the fretboard and strings fast enough to play the fugue decently).

Anyway, I am still noticing that if I skip back to the first few exercises of the book, I occasionally hit the wrong string or play the wrong note. I feel like I should have those earlier pieces mastered.

Is it just beginner clumsiness? Or should I go back and try to completely master those pieces so they can be played perfectly every time? Is mastery really knowing the piece, or perfect flawless execution? What should I be aiming for as a student - especially on pieces that I've been playing awhile?
 




 Hey everyone. This is hopefully a simple question.

I paid off my car this year, but have continued to "pay my bill" into a savings account. At this point it's about 1500$. The goal is to eventually use thay as a down payment for a new car, or to pay off a new car completely for either my wife or myself.

The savings account earns .75%, not great, not horrible. I'm considering taking that money and putting it into a well diversified portfolio of funds instead.

Is this a good idea? I figure if one of our cars dies, my wife and I have an emergency fund and the ability (even if it sucks) to drive one another to work (i even have the option to telecommute). That contingency should cover us for the time it takes to sell however many shares necessary. My wife's car has about 70k miles on it, mine has about 101000 and we both plan to drive them until they cant be realistically maintained anymore.

Any feedback would be appreciated. 









 So, interesting question I hope. Does anyone know of any funds which collect companies directly related to the growing/sale of marijuana?

For instance, lots of folks have heard of Medbox and the massive boom they encountered. I can only imagine as more states move towards medicinal marijuana, decriminalization, and full legalization we will see many more business opportunities.

In that same vein - are there any "vice" funds? Funds comprised of companies that cater to mankind's baser urges - condoms, casinos, alcohol, tobacco, etc? 




 Basically what the title says.

We keep our mortgage money in its own separate account from everything else, and it gets funded from our checking account automatically ever pay period. Thanks to 3 pay months, the account that account has 2 mortgage payments worth of cash in it in addition to the amount that we're paying on the 1st of november (assuming something bad would happen, we would cancel the extra we are paying and just pay the minimums).

I want to keep 1 months payment on hand at all times just in case something weird ever happens with paychecks or whatever.

However, we're a few thousand away from paying off PMI (home cost 194k, we are at around 159k on principal now, pmi should go away at around 151k/78%). We are already paying about 860 towards principal (150 base plus 710 extra), but if we sacrifice that extra month's security we could get PMI to go away even faster - about 2-3 payments faster (a savings of 160-240 or so dollars).

So, what is everyone's thoughts? Sacrifice the security for 2-3 months less of PMI? Or just play it safe? 




 Hey everyone!
When I added my card to circle, it stated that I may get hit with a cash advance fee for using their service.

My cash advance rate on my credit card is astronomical, and I'd really like to avoid that. Is there any easy way to tell if I'll get hit with it or not? 




 Hey everyone, we are entering fall now in my zone (USDA 6), but I recently received some 5000 seeds for Spilanthes Oleracea (toothache plant) that I really want to begin growing. I know nothing about grow lights.

I'd like to avoid HPS/MV/MH due to fire risk and cost of equipment.

So, can I use CFLs/LEDs for growing these guys? Do I *need* HPS/MV/MH bulbs?

How do I go about figuring out the ratios of time for lights on/lights off? Sadly when I start googling about it, I find lots of information about growing pot, but not much about growing other plants. For a flower like this, I would assume I would start with 24/7 light over the seeds while they germinate, and then some other ratio once they are ready to flower??

Any help would be appreciated, I've never done any indoor growing like this. 




 Hey everyone. I am trying to find a service that offers a similar service to what sharebuilder used to offer. They used to provide a membership option where you'd pay N dollars a month and get up to X AUTOMATIC trades a month as part of the package. It gave you an excellent discount for folks who wanted automated dollar cost averaging.

However, the plan isnt offered on their website anymore, and I spoke with their support and it has been removed. The new price structure is significantly more expensive (a flat $3.95 per trade). 

So, is there any other brokerage that operates the way sharebuilder used to? 




 Hey everyone. I received a $25 iphone gift card a few days ago. I more or less never use the itunes store, so it doesn't do much for me. BTC however does. Is there any safe market for me to sell the itunes code? 




 This email was received this morning:
 Dear Clients
 
 Regrettably I have to announce the failure and closure of Bitcoin Trader.
 
 While preparing for the final audit results, a task we were working on for weeks now, our bitcoin wallet has been hacked and emptied, just after exchanging our fiat holdings within the exchanges to bitcoin and transferring our entire holdings to our wallet, in order to proof our solvency.
 
 It is a known fact that I personally opposed any proof of solvency, but agreed to conduct it for the sake of a few dozen small and medium investors.
 
 The hacker contacted me shortly after he took advantage of our holdings and demanded a ransom in order to transfer the coins back. I have agreed to a 25% ransom of the entire sum, but havent heard back from him for several days now.
 
 My aim was to create something based on trust, just as bitcoin itself is based on distributed trust. Unfortunately I must admit today, I have failed. All left to do now is to declare bankruptcy with the Panamanian authorities and to hand over all relevant files and information for further investigation.
 
 Sincerely,
 John Carley

This same John Carley whose staff has been claiming that he was "lost at sea" for close to a week now.

Let this be a lesson - trust no one. Anyone who says to "trust the earnings" has never been burnt, or is lying to you.  




 Hey everyone.
I am reading through the gift card rules for ebay, and it's kind of dismaying. I was hoping to start selling gift card codes (I'm a reseller with several vendors) via ebay, but it appears you need to have a physical card in hand, can't have more than 1 card selling at a time, etc.

However, does anyone know if I can sell a gift card VOUCHER? Essentially I would purchase the gift card voucher on my end, and when the customer purchases the gift card voucher, I would mail a print out of the voucher to them with tracking information.

Is this a violation of the rules? For the life of me I can't seem to get feedback from ebay about this. 




 Hey folks.
I am trying to start getting my tax info ready for 2014 for mining.

I had done a bit of mining using multipool, so I have a large number of transactions for small coins; stuff like TIPS, DGC, etc.

How can I figure out the value of those coins on the day they were mined? For many, there is no direct USD price history.

For instance, I looked at the chart at the bottom of this link:
http://myip.ms/view/market_coins/147/TIPS_LTC.html

An example - on feb 5th 2014, it says that at that time, 1 TIPS sold for an average of 0.00000051 LTC. Does that mean the value of LTC at the time? Or does it mean the value of LTC now?

At the time 1 LTC was 21.149991995 dollars USD:
http://www.cryptocoincharts.info/pair/ltc/usd/crypto-trade/1-year

So is the math:
21.149991995 * 0.00000051 * N where N is the number of TIPS?

Or do I need to use the current value of LTC in USD?

Any advice would be appreciated.

I'm trying to make my taxes honest this year as my mining operation starts getting larger and larger. 




 Hey everyone. I am looking to start purchasing larger quantities of gift cards with the intention of reselling. My big issue right now is sourcing. Given most of my selling avenues will take a bite out of my margin, I can't seem to find a good source that can absorb the cost of overhead and still leave meat on the bone for me.

Amazon offers an API to generate codes, but there is a minimum of $50,000 a year, which is going to be darn near impossible. This means I have to buy varieties of them in orders of $5k or more. Still too much for me to start with :(

When I google for it, I get a TON of seo-optimized zero information websites made to play the googlebot, so I'm unable to find real leads.

How does one get started in this industry? Do you have to start reaching out to the retailers directly? Do they offer APIs to purchase gift cards on the fly? 




 Hey everyone.
Last week, bitcoin-trader.biz issued a statement that the audit that their users had paid for was not going to be released because they felt it was "unsatisfactory." A number of users became very concerned about this, especially considering that the users themselves had paid for the audit to be conducted.

As of this afternoon when payouts were scheduled to begin, BT issued this statement on their facebook page:

Due to technical issues with the key server, which occurred during the processing of cashout requests not all pending bitcoin cashout requests could be processed. We have contacted our sys admin to look into the issue and will resume bitcoin cashout requests as soon as possible. About 200 or so bitcoin requests accumulated during the weekend had been processed, as well as all the other payment systems, Litecoin and Ripple.

BT supposedly deals in USD. A number of users waited until bitcoin bottomed out over the weekend before requesting their payout, locking in the amount of BTC. However, given the increase, some users now are owed BTC that is up to 25% more valuable. So, for instance, if someone requested a cash out of $260 over the weekend when it was valued at .92BTC, that amount of BTC was locked in. Payments aren't processed until monday - and that .92BTC is now valued at $330+ USD, but BT owes the locked in amount of BTC.

If several hundred users did this, it could spell major financial trouble for the site. 




 Wheeeeeee!

Who else is enjoying the firesale? Who else is picking up tons of cheap bitcoin?

I've got cash set aside and am buying a little every day for the next few weeks until things stablize to let dollar cost averaging do its work.

The way I see it, all those underground markets that we try to distance ourselves from? They still use bitcoin. Those companies that started up built entirely around bitcoin? They still use it. It has utility. Utility equates to demand.

There is a limited supply of bitcoin.

Limited supply + some amount of demand = a market price.

So, the market may crash, but bitcoin isn't going anywhere. I'm just hanging on and enjoying the chance to lower my cost basis. 




 Hey everyone! I work for a large, fortune 500 company. I am submitting the idea for us to add bitcoin as a payment option for our customers (no promises, we just have an internal "ideas" portal). However as part of it, I need to have some realistic information.

Right now, the best options for a payment portal would be coinbase, paypal and circle. Bitcoin *would* automatically be converted to fiat. Does anyone have any idea what the fees are for the automatic conversion to fiat? I know credit processing runs anywhere from 2-5% depending on the processor.

Also, does anyone know what percentage of purchases bitcoin payments make up for some of the big names out there (newegg, overstock)?

As a benefit, there's no way for a chargeback to occur, which is a great selling point too.

Any other selling points? I'd like to think that as a vendor, any way we can help a customer to give us their money is a good thing :) 














 Hey everyone. We picked this up for my wife, and she has a good 6-8 hours of playtime in it. The issue is, she was playing under my account. She wanted to transfer it back under her account so I could play as well.

If we attempt to copy the save from my account to hers, it gives an error saying that the save appears to be from another user.

Is there any way to fix this? 









 Hey everyone.
Christmas time is coming, and I'd like to get the wife the matching pearl bracelet to go with the necklace I got her last year. The one downside is, bluenile doesn't seem to accept bitcoin which sucks. I've always been a fan of them because A) their documentation rocks, B) their support rocks, C) they specialize in a lot of simple, elegant designs which my wife loves.

I see lots of gift certs available for zales and other companies, but nothing for bluenile. So, any ideas? 




 Hey everyone!
I'm just curious - what made you focus on classical guitar?

For me, I can point to two things in particular.... these guys:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT9hvyDvKHA

And this piece:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPiatDf3Rxs

More flamenco/nuevo flamenco than classical obviously, but through a lucky combination of lack of knowledge and eagerness to get started I ended up going the classical route to get started. I just have never quite shifted over to flamenco (my hands are still kind of clumsy).

So how about you? What kicked it off for you? 




 Just tried the moon strike 4 times in a row. Each time, got to Phogoth. Each time, had at least 1 person quit after we wiped. Each time, ended up being the last person left. Seriously feeling completely unsuccessful because other people suck.

Seriously, if you join up for a strike, quitting the first time you die is just lame. Stick through it.
 









 This may be long. Sorry.

I am a successful 30yo male engineer. I've lived on my own since I was 16 - my parents and I get along ok so long as we aren't under the same roof. 

I'll come out and say it - I'm smarter than them. Or, at the very least I research my decisions before making them and back them up with said research. I was a straight A student. Racked up tons of community service, was active in a church youth group. I led several student groups. I won congressional good citizenship awards. I was never in trouble. I just asked questions and wanted good answers.

So, when I lived with them, I would point out things that didn't make sense. that maybe a gigantic steak with mashed potatoes, a big helping of cake, and soda wasn't always the best dietary decision for each person. I am the only person in the family without diabetes now. I would point out that if they have to take a 3rd mortgage out on their home, maybe giving 500 dollars to charity isn't the wisest choice. They are almost 70 and still about 80k in debt, whereas I have all of my loans paid off save for a mortgage and one private student loan (in total, less than 2 years salary for me). I'd point out that if their church is pressuring them to fork over mortgage money, maybe it's time for a new church. They'd take me wanting to make myself a healthy soup for dinner instead of having the same calorie-ladened food as them and I'd get screamed at for hours as "unappreciative." By the time I graduated high school I weighed nearly 350 pounds ("you don't get up from this table until you've cleaned that plate!").

I'm doing well, not because of them, but in spite of them. I know this sounds arrogant, and maybe it is. But so far everything we've had it out on when I was a teenager has worked out well.

Back then though, any time I'd point out logical flaws or fallacies, or try to improve things for myself, they took it as me being "ungrateful." So, to "teach me a lesson" they decided to send me to a family friend for some "tough love" for a summer. I never went back home. 

The first week was great. He had been someone I looked up to. He was a decorated retired soldier that I thought would understand that my parents are a bit off kilter and prone to making bad decisions and hyperbole. We talked about it a lot the first week. He actively asked me about the issues I was having at home.

Then one night while I am sleeping, I get slapped. It was him with a steel baseball bat, standing over me. He told me I was his for the summer, and he was going to teach me how good I had it "back home." So began a summer of physical, emotional, and mental abuse. He'd force me to work outside for hours with no sunscreen ("what are you, a little bitch? Man up, you dont need sunscreen.") which led to my shoulders blistering, cracking, bleeding. I still have those physical scars. That put me in the hospital for heat stroke. He beat me several times for whatever perceived slight he could conjure up. He said he had people spying on me, and claimed I destroyed his pool by pouring bleach into it because "one of his spies saw it." (I had had 2 people over that night and we were inside the whole time, so no, it was not me who touched his pool). I got a summer job and begged to stay there for extra hours, but when I got a paycheck he threatened to beat me if I didn't sign it over to him. He refused to feed me, and said I had to pay for my own food. I lost nearly 40 pounds that summer from stress and lack of food. The only things I ate were free food at my workplace (a pretzel place in a walmart that had an "employees can help themselves" policy - i literally lived on pretzel dogs and pretzels for the summer). I begged my parents to take me home but they were the ones who put me there. He busted my nose. My parents kept telling me "it's not that bad. You WANTED a vacation from home, right?"

But the worst was one night after a day of work, I came home and he forced me to sit down next to him on the couch. He turned on a porno. I have no idea if this was genuine or if it was just more mental abuse. He started talking about how when he was in the military he participated in an orgy and it was the most sexually thrilling moment of his life. He hands me some tissues and tells me to jerk off for him. I say no, that I'm uncomfortable. He keeps saying it's ok, if I jerk off he will too, I keep saying no, no, no. He keeps pressuring me. He starts throwing tissues at me and telling me to whip it out. I get up and run out of the house and sprint as fast as I can down the nearby highway. 

Police are called and pick me up, I tell them I want to go home. Police listen to my parents, and take me back to abuser's house "because they want to teach me a lesson and scare me straight." He proceeds to beat the shit out of me, threatens me with the bat that he'll bash my skull in if I ever try that again, etc.

Finally summer ends, and my parents take me back home. I contact my best friend and move out immediately. I leave everything behind. I just want out of my parents house. I sever all ties with the abuser. He severs ties with my family for the most part. I am on poor terms with my family, I see them maybe 1 day a year.

I never talked to them about everything that happened other than the fact that when I needed them, they weren't there for me and refused to help me or believe me. They keep saying it was for my own good.

Fast forward to a year ago. I get a message from the abuser in facebook. I ignore it. I get another, and I ignore it. I get a friend request. I deny it. I get another. I ignore it. Then I get a call from my mom asking me why I won't talk to the abuser.  It turns out that my parents, who are both very sick (mom in a wheelchair, dad in and out of the hospital) have been getting tons of help from the abuser for free. He put a roof on their house. He repaired their sidewalks, etc. They view him as a son. I like that they're getting free things out of the asshole. So long as I don't have to see or hear from him or hear ABOUT him, I'm content.

I tell her to stop trying to force it. I don't want to talk to him. I don't want to see him. My mom keeps trying to set up days for me to come over to the house when he just so happens to be there. I turn around, grab my wife, get in my car, and drive away.

Finally I told the abuser point blank that I have no desire to ever speak to him. To leave me alone. Stay the hell out of my life.

Yesterday my wife had to drop by my parent's house to grab a phone charger for my dad who was rushed to the hospital a few days ago. While there, my mom tells my wife that they my father had asked the abuser to "give me a rough summer to see how good I had it at home." my dad wants to talk to me about it. I don't want to talk about it.

I don't want to destroy the guys life. He had it rough (mom shot herself with a shotgun, dad was an abusive alcoholic and ultimately killed himself). He has kids. He does help my parents. I am content to have no contact with him. My parents just won't drop it. Maybe the jerkoff thing was some fucked up mind game. I'm not broken, I've done very well for myself. I'm paranoid of people and an introvert, but I've always been that way.

It's when he reaches out to me and pushes the issue, then I want blood. I also am concerned about my nephews who live with my parents. What if it wasn't a mind game? Maybe he'll try the same thing with my nephews? Would my parents even believe me if I said something? They have a very strong penchant for denial about bad things in their life.

And now here I am. Asking you all for your advice. I want this person out of my life. He so far has respected my wishes to leave me the hell alone, but he bitches to my parents and they pressure me to talk to him. I just want it to go away.

I just don't know what to do. The only people who know the whole story are my wife, a very close friend who was also the victim of abuse, and now all of you.

It's been showing in my coinbase account for hours now. 0 confirmations. I'm trying to understand what I'm seeing - it looks like scores of addresses each getting a small transaction with btcsmart listed as the source address? Is it basically bitcoin spam? 

Did they get my address somehow? 




 Hey everyone. My wife and I are planning to have a child in the next 18-24 months, but we were thinking we could jump start an educational account now by putting 50-100$ of every paycheck in ahead of time to maximize growth. It's not much, but that 2400-4800$ will grow over 18 years or so.

The account that seems to come up the most often is a 529. When we would create the 529, do we have to name the beneficiary? Since this is a kid that doesn't yet exist, that would be hard for us to do.

Are there any other types of account that would give beneficial tax treatment for this kind of savings?

Also, what are the caveats if said child would ultimately choose not to seek secondary education? Say, if they decided to go entrepreneurial, or if they went to a tech school?

Any advice would be very much appreciated. Thank you!!

Edit: Found some old threads. I've already maxed out the 401k up to the point where my employer stops matching, and I'm contributing an additional 1% to a roth 401k. My wife is a teacher and should get some kind of pension, in addition she contributes to a 403b. She just got her masters, and will be significantly upping her contribution. 




 Hey everyone. Apologies if this has been asked before, a quick search didn't show me anything.

I've been looking at zenportal all day today, and I keep seeing a pink "progress bar" saying that payouts are in progress. They've been in progress since about 9am EST. Is this normal...? From what I was reading payouts are usually handled by 10am CST? I picked up my first hashlets yesterday and today. 




 Hey everyone. I'm struggling to find reasons to keep playing destiny. As it stands for me, it's lonely and kind of dull. I picked it up for the coop.

I just got my first PS3 about 2 weeks ago. It's the first console I've owned since I had a sega genesis decades ago. Most of my friends have moved on to a newer gen, so playing with them isn't an option. I'm also not a young guy with a ton of friends who are gamers, so my friend list is empty.

I hear folks saying they get tons of invites - after about 20 hours of gameplay, I've gotten a total of 1 and have never interacted with the person. It's also kind of clunky to see someone in a pvp match, hit R3 to select them, then open a menu, send an invite, only to find out that in that time I've been killed and the selection isn't there anymore. So, after awhile I just stopped bothering.

So, I see folks suggesting clans. Well, how does that work exactly? Do I join the clan, and then manually add every single person to the clan to my friend list? Do I have to keep maintaining that? Is there any way to automatically sync it with the game? Do I need to have a PC with teamspeak/rogerwilco nearby?

Seeing folks in game and not being able to really interact with them is just killing this game for me. I'm feeling like I wasted 90$ to socialize with people and am being limited to jumping and dancing, which is really disappointing to me. 




 I havent really been silent about how much I dislike the refusal to allow much, if any, interactivity between players. I know golks try to justify it by saying that everyone ELSE is an annoying 12 year old, or whatever.

I think what really bothers me is the fact that their ads show people talking to one another. They dont show the players dancing or jumping to communicate - theyre talking. Social interaction was advertised. But it isn't there unless you start adding a bunch of random people to your friend list. 




 Hey everyone.
I personally have a sizable stake in a closed end fund. It has incredible results, and has for over a decade. I understand their strategy, their financials are good. By all normal investing standards, they would be a great place to invest.

Yet every time I see them mentioned, there are huge cautions that they are a closed end fund and you should understand closed end funds before getting involved. I DO understand closed end funds, and honestly, I don't quite get the concern about them vs a traditional mutual fund. 

I get that there are a set number of shares in existence and that will not change, and their price is determined by the market value of the fund shares themselves, as opposed to the value of the component stocks behind the fund. But why the constant warnings for additional caution and scrutiny everywhere? It seems like a pretty easy thing to understand, and I can't quite put my finger on the reason for all of the warnings. It doesn't seem any more dangerous than any other investment vehicle.

Any thoughts? 




 Hey everyone. I snagged the list of compromised "gmail accounts" from this site after seeing some of the news stories:
https://forum.btcsec.com/index.php?/topic/9426-gmail-meniai-parol/page-3

Happily, none of my accounts are listed.
Sadly though, my wife's account is.

Is there any way I can find out what password it was that was listed with it? We probably only need 2 or 3 characters to figure it out from there. Luckily she usually uses complicated passwords, and different ones at every site. It may provide a clue as to what site the compromise came from.

I know there had been an online checking tool that would list the first 2-3 characters, but it has since been stripped out of most of the articles I have found.

Any help would really be apppreciated. 




 This is something that has been bothering me since last night. Given the lack of communication abilities, would you notice if 99% of the other players in the game were bots? How do you know they aren't bots?

I'm just thinking of Guild Wars 2, where in the early levels, you'd see the exact same bots "playing" at the same time as you. The same names, the same race as you, often even the same class. The first few playthroughs it gave the illusion of having lots of people playing, however eventually you started to notice the exact same player every single time and the illusion got shattered. They were playing beside you, but it was obvious that it was a trick. 




 Since bungie seems dead set on not letting players communicate, I propose reviving morse code. In game, you can use your gun and simply shoot. 

For example, need help? SOS!
3 shots in rapid succession, 3 shots with long pauses between them, and then finally 3 shots in rapid succession.

OR we could do a single jump for a dot, and a double jump for a dash.

OR we could spam eachother with fireteam invites in rapid succession, but that would require the other player to decline the invites.



OR... well... bungie could just let players talk to each other. But that's just crazy talk. 




 About 2 hours ago I got to sit down and finally play Destiny for a bit. I've had it since this morning, but with work, dinner, helping the wife etc I haven't had a chance to play. These are the scattered thoughts I have about the experience. I'm not a fanboy. I didn't play beta, alpha. I'm also not negative about the game. I do think there are a lot of places this could be brushed up, and Bungie should really know better.

So, let's start with the install. This went super easy. I'm using RCN 50mbps down service, so there's very little that doesn't scream when it comes to downloading. This was no exception. The full download and install took about an hour (the install taking the lion's share of that on my PS3).

Next, I registered my Sparrow code (I preordered the DGE via Gamestop for the uncommon Sparrow). Again, no issues at all. This part, for me, went painlessly. I've seen tons of issues on reddit though, so it looks like a bunch of folks got unlucky, which sucks.

I logged into the bungie site and registered the full list of codes, nothing gave me any problems.

So, game launch! Almost immediately I encountered an error. I've posted about it on here, and over on the bungie forums with no real suggestions. When the brightness setting comes up, it says to make it so the logo to the left is barely visible. The problem is, the logo is never visible. Like, it simply isn't there. When you go into options and bring it up, you see the logo briefly, but then the entire background goes black (Here's a snapshot: http://imgur.com/QZw9WAa) No idea how to fix it. Some folks have suggested my TV, but it's a very high end 51" Samsung plasma that supports every video option from the PS3. Some folks have suggested to change the color settings - no, this has been professionally calibrated. I'm not changing it for one game. No other game has issues. My post on the bungie support site has been ignored. -1 for a bad first impression, even if it doesn't seem to impact gameplay. I went so far as to eventually try a full uninstall and reinstall because my new 95$ toy seems to have been partly broken on arrival. Bungie seems to have no real support on their website either - just a forum where if you ask a difficult question, you basically never get a response. In fact, the vast majority of questions on their help forum have gone unanswered. That's troubling. I get it, it's opening day, they're focused on triage. But seriously, not even a "open a support request" page?

So, that aside, I went ahead and created a character, specifically a human male titan. One of the things I kept hearing about this was how in depth the character creation was. I was actually kind of disappointed here - it was nowhere near as limitless as it was hyped to be. Choose your race, your gender, your skin color, your lip color, your eye color, your hairstyle and color, and if you want any facial markings or scars. But if you're human, you can't get cool markings. If you're one of the awoken, you don't get to have scars. It seems artificially limiting - especially when folks have been talking up how deep it went. I was expecting Skyrim type customization where you can control everything down to facial geometry. Still, i was able to put together a fairly dude-ly toon and I kicked it off.

The opening video has some interesting stylistic choices. There's lots of screen jumping and color palette flickering that goes on, to the point where I actually thought it was a bug or problem with the video file (you can see what I mean here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN9nWByWQD4). Or, I thought it was going to suddenly pull back and turn out to be a monitor someone else was watching. Having watched it 2-3 times now, I get that there are little text blurbs saying "video feed," so it's supposed to look grainy and jumpy. But the first time through, it still felt like the style didn't jive with what they wanted. Still, it got the point across. There's a big snowball floating over mars that makes it rain.

The opening cutscene was flipping gorgeous even on the PS3. I can only imagine on current gen systems. The HDR effects are wicked. Suddenly I'm whisked into existence, and the game starts. I get told to run by a little floating snowball-eye-beholder-dude because some robot lizard men are apparently after me. Except, they're not. I just stand there and they never come. The snowball-eye-beholder-dude starts yelling at me that i'll die, so I stand there to spite him and prove him wrong. I don't die. I get that it's supposed to get me inside, but wouldn't it have been better to have something actually chasing me? Something to make me have a reason to use the sprint button it's telling me about?

So, I played through the first level, the tower, and then the second level from that point on. It played like a normal console FPS. Except I see people around me. But I can't really do anything with them. I can kind of jump towards them a bit? I can't say hey. I can't say "hey dudebro, let's go kick this big mechasaurus dude's ass." I can't say "I need some help, got a sec." I can't say "hey fuckface, I was killing that mechasaurus, beat it." Other people are just NPCs, except you can't interact with them like you can the NPCs (which isn't asking a lot - I'll get to that later).

Everything is super pretty. So much so, that I kind of wish they'd fleshed out other portions of the game a bit more instead of being so graphics focused. I came from the Zork generation, so anything more than text on a screen is decent by my standards.

The voice acting seems kind of meh at this point. For all of the production value, I would have expected something better than what I'm hearing so far. Maybe I'm still dealing with generic low level characters, but still, nothing. What bothers me more is that there's no real dialog with the NPCs. They have one tagline they mention when you approach them, and then when you leave. What should be dialog is instead just a series of menus with a quip at either end. There's no discussing the impending doom of everyone, there's no talking about how good it is to be alive. Hell, I can't even ask the little floating snowball-eye-beholder-dude why the hell he raised me from the dead. It seems like they created a world ripe for interactivity, in which there is basically no interactivity at all. Hell, so far as I've found, I can't even sell crap I don't need to vendors. I guess that would be just too darn interactive! Instead I have to dismantle items instead, so yet again, a chance to interact with SOMETHING is dropped.

At the end of the second mission, some dude in a mask comes out and tells me about the doom facing us all, and I was excited - finally a chance to ask questions! But nope, dropped back in the tower.

So, I switch my gear around, only to find that literally every single piece looks the same. To the point where I honestly can't tell whether or not I've switched anything.

At this point, I have to be honest, my feelings are mixed. It feels like a shooting gallery. You go out shooting, you go back to the tower/lobby. Maybe some other people visit the shooting gallery at the same time as you, maybe they don't. You don't have any control over it, and you can't say hi even if you want. You can try to talk to the vendors and people around the shooting gallery, but they're just shills who say "go shoot more in the shooting gallery!"

I'll play through to the end, but thus far I wish I could say I'm more impressed. But I can't. There are so many good things here, but there are so many missed opportunities it hurts. It also feels like the game has no idea what it wants to be.

So, does this ever get more interactive? Does the voice acting improve? I'm guessing the story improves, but am I basically just going to be shown a movie/cutscene, shoot, watch a movie/cutscene, shoot, ad nauseum? Let me know.
 




 When you go to help.bungie.net it gives you the option to search for your issue, or it points you to the support forum. I've had a post on there for several hours now with not a single response. I'd like to at least get some kind of acknowledgement that someone has seen my issue.

Is there any way to actually get real support? 




 Hey everyone. Woke up and installed this AM. I briefly hopped on just to take a look (working today so I won't get to really play until tonight). One of the first screens the game shows you is the brightness setting.

The text goes something like this: "adjust the brightness until you can just barely see the symbol on the left."

The problem is, there's no symbol on the left. The only thing that changes with the brightness is the background behind the dialog area. I've tried every brightness setting - no symbol. So, I went by the background.

Is this a typo or is something weird?



I also noticed that during the opening FMV with the astronauts, there were a bunch of weird color shifts that would occasionally pop up. Once I got into the game everything seemed just fine though.

Not sure if my install is just bonkers or what. 




 Hey everyone. I work for a large telecom company doing research and development work. It's a rock solid job, and for the most part I like the work. But, I just got headhunted by a recruiter for a startup.

This would be a significant wage increase, plus it would shorten my commute from 5 hours a day 3+ times a week to about a half hour daily. No idea about benefits yet. As it stands, I'll be talking to the recruiter tomorrow to find out more, completely noncommittal. I've done some snooping around and I *think* I know who their client is, and if my suspicions are correct, it could turn out to be a pretty cool opportunity.

However, I know my current employer tends to make counteroffers when one of their R D guys splits ways. So, how does that usually happen? Do I go through the interview process at the new place and then tell my manager "oh yeah, btw I'm leaving, make me a counteroffer now if you want?" with a resignation letter?

Do you tell the manager that a recruiter contacted you ahead of time, but act noncommittal?

I'm just trying to figure this out because I've never left such a good job before at such a stable company.

 









 Hey everyone. 

I've been looking at the possibility of picking up an adapter to attach a keyboard/mouse to my ps3 because there are a FEW FPS's I'd like to play. I've always been a PC gamer, and one of the biggest problems is that FPS's feel so clunky to me on a controller. I feel like I can't aim. The analog acceleration throws things off. As someone who has literally played FPS's for more than 20 years, it's hard to feel comfortable.

I was looking at the eagle eye adapter, but what I'm reading basically says that it just translates mouse movement into analog stick movement, so it doesn't really get me closer to my goal of having a natural feeling mouse.

Now, most of the reviews I'm finding are from 4+ years ago. So, has this ever changed? Is there a mouse/keyboard driver available for PS3? Maybe they've added the bluetooth keyboard/mouse profiles to the OS's bluetooth stack?

I don't have high hopes, but I'd love to find out. 




 Hey everyone.
I am kind of torn - I've decided to pre-order, but I'm not sure about what edition to get. I'm leaning towards getting the digital guardian edition code from gamestop so not only do I get all of the guardian edition bonuses, but I also get the sparrow upgrade.

However, what has me torn is the fact that I'm not sure how much I like the idea of a download vs a physical disk. With a physical disk, if I end up not liking it I can always take it back to the store, right? With the digital edition, I'm more or less stuck with it. No refunds, no store credit.

I'll be getting this for a PS3, so if I DO end up liking it, if I've bought the physical copy I can take it to the store, get trade in credit, and use that to buy the PS4 version, right?

Or is this going to be like MMOs, where even a physical copy only matters for the first buyer - you can't resell them because they're bound to a license key that is non-transferrable?

Anyone have any ideas?

Do you think the extra bonuses from the digital guardian edition (the ship, the new version of ghost, and the upgraded sparrow) are worth the lack of flexibility? Just interested to get some feedback from people. 














 So, I just got a PS3 this morning (well, actually yesterday, but it took 4 preowned PS3's from gamestop before I got one that worked properly). I picked up a 50$ PSN gift card too, with the intention of taking advantage of the Sly Cooper and God of War collection flash sales this weekend.

Well, thanks to douchey mcdouchebag, I can't get into my PSN account to buy them. 

When stuff like this happens, do the flash sales get extended to make up for the lost time? Or am I more or less boned? 









 Hey everyone!
The title pretty much says it all. I am trying to find somewhere to buy PSN/PS gold gift cards with bitcoin. Every place I find with google has a big SOLD OUT sign over all of their offerings. Any ideas would be super helpful, thanks! 




 Hey everyone, I need help. 2 years ago I picked up a pair of galaxy s3's for my wife and I. She had had an old nokia POS that she never bothered to answer because she always had it on silent. It was an endless source of frustration.

As part of getting the new phones (doubling our monthly plan's cost), I made her promise to keep the sound on on her phone. In my view, we usually call each other when we need something ASAP, so the phone is like an emergency device. Her reason is she doesnt like to have a ringer in public places or at work, and she cant hear or feel vibrate, so it can take hours of calling over and over to get through for her. Not very good when it's an emergency, right?

This morning it took close to 2 hours to get in touch with her, during an emergency where I was stranded on the side of the road. It ended up leading to a loss of money, and a huge argument. I want this resolved.
So, is there any way, or any app that will automatically raise the volume/enable the ringer for a particular set of callers? That way she can keep her phone silent as she likes, but she can still have a ringer go off when I or her family call her.

I've heard folks say locale can do it, but they have no demo and I haven't gotten a response from emailing them. The app is 10$, so it's a steep jump to have it not turn out to do what we need.

Another suggestion I got was WhoIsIt, but that only seems to let me assign different ringtones to people. It doesn't enable sound when the phone is set to silent/vibrate.

Any advice would be really appreciated. 









 Luckily I am working from home today, and my wife has off from work. She went out to the garden and found the most adorable little girl poking around.

We've brought her inside, given her something to eat, and are now going through the motions of trying to get her checked for a microchip and calling the police. Does anyone know of a decent sub to post info on found dogs? The only one I could find was /r/lostdog which has a total of 1 post on it, so that didn't seem too helpful.

Does anyone have any idea of the breed? I'm not too good with small dogs. Here are two photos:

She weighs about 10 lbs.

Super timely - the wife just got back from the vet, she was microchipped, and we've gotten in touch with the owners. Thank you guys!!

I'd really appreciate some feedback here. How many of you agree with this opinion?

"Don't challenge an officer" - so, how can I ask if I'm being detained? Isn't THAT challenging an officer? What about asking to see a badge number? Isn't THAT challenging an officer? So, what rights do we really have? Saying I don't consent to any searches, isn't THAT challenging an officer? So, using ANY of our constitutional rights requires us risking being attacked?

The officer states that if the officer you are dealing with is violating your civil rights, we're supposed to file a complaint later on. But let's see what happens when people try to do that:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8v7lF5ttlQ

Are police officers aware of how this looks to the public? Do what we say, or we will hurt/kill you, and if you try to complain, we'll hurt/kill you then? I'm just incredulous by this attitude. 




 I am trying to gauge interest. Do you like coffee? Would you buy doge coffee? How much would you buy a month of coffee beans (1 12oz bag? 2 12oz bags? 4? 8? 12? 100??)

I am working to start a small artisinal coffee roasting business. Beans will all be of the highest quality, single origin, and roasted to order. We will grind them if requested.

I've got some administrative things that need to be handled, some equipment to buy, and we also have to find a certified kitchen that doesn't charge ridiculous amounts of cash and doesn't mind getting flooded with smoke, so this won't happen immediately. But I'd love to help support the community! 




 Hey everyone. First, this post is largely copied from the same post over in /r/smallbusiness. I hope that's ok - I couldn't find anything in the rules that discouraged duplicates and because there's no links allowed, I couldn't crosspost. Mods, if that's a problem let me know and I'll delete this (or at least retype it, haha). I have added some additional details.

I am looking into starting a small artisinal coffee roasting business, operating largely online and locally. I'll be starting small because of the larger startup costs of industrial roasting equipment. I also don't have access to a certified kitchen - we can't get our personal kitchen certified because we have a dog and cat, and I'm hesitant to rent space because I doubt I can make it profitable with the additional overhead, plus, there's another reason below.

From a business perspective I believe I am in a good position to pursue this. I am on the board of directors for a local food cooperative, and as such am networked with several hundred local "foodies" who would love the chance to support a local coffee roasting business. I'm also networked indirectly with several thousand more throughout our state. I've been doing the simplest market research possible - just asking people in the community if they'd purchase coffee, and about how much coffee a month they'd purchase. Results have been positive across the board, which is encouraging.

I can find plenty of information about certified kitchens and regulations on food prep. However, I can't seem to find any information about what applies when you are preparing food outdoors. Roasting creates a lot of smoke, so currently when I roast it is done outside. This is another reason I'd be worried about renting space. If I am just going to roast outside (until I am doing enough volume to warrant an actual work space, industrial equipment, and proper ventilation), why would I want to rent a commercial kitchen?

I know at fairs you see people making and selling food with grills and friers, but nothing is 'up to par' with what you'd see in a certified kitchen. I also see the occasional "pop up" bbq place selling ribs and brisket outside gas stations. So, does outdoor food prep have regulations? Are they different? Are they relaxed? I know in several states the handling and roasting of coffee beans is exempt from requiring a ServSafe food manager.

Not sure if this is the right sub, but if someone could point me in the right direction I'd appreciate any advice. I've written to the state dept of agriculture but haven't gotten any response.

This is in Northampton County, Pennsylvania, USA.

 Seriously - in the past 3 years, I have lost entire crops to vine borers twice. We have an organic garden, and only use neem. We have been wrapping stems of our squash with nylons, and spraying 1-2x a week with neem (more if it rains). This week we lost our yellow squash, our cucumbers, and our zucchini. Somehow the little bastards still get in.

So, since we are at mid august, I am considering planting my pumpkins. We've pulled up all of the dead squash, cucumbers, zucchini, and I plan to plant in the same places. I'll be giving the soil a good soaking with neem, turn it a bit with a cultivator and a hoe. I'm HOPING we are past the time when vine borers hatch since they usually do that near the end of july/early august. The infested plants have been burnt to keep the eggs out of my compost and to make sure the larvae never make it to adulthood.

Is it too foolhardy to plant pumpkins in the same spot? Should I just give up on pumpkins for the year?

I can deal with losing the squash and cucumbers because they produce so well early on in the season. But for some reason I get emotionally devastated when I lose pumpkin crops. It breaks my heart to see hundreds of beautiful pumpkins get reduced to rotting piles of mush over the course of 2-3 days.

I've found a lack of really decent options for dealing with vine borers outside of nematodes, but companion planting radishes can screw them (nematodes) up so I feel like my hands are a little tied.

Any ideas would be greatly appreciated. 














 ...because there are literally 2-3 wedding "congratulations" cards that are appropriate in any card store we visit. And they all suck.

My wife and I have 2 dear friends who, despite being together for 20 years, have been unable to be married in Pennsylvania. Well, thanks to our courageous attorney general, we finally have marriage equality! Which is awesome, and, our dear friends, as of yesterday, have tied the knot!

So, this brings me to the problem. We stopped in hallmark first, only to discover that half of the cards in the entire wedding section referred to "his and hers" "she and him" "husband and wife" "man and wife" "mr and mrs" or something else based on traditional marriage. Then, the rest of the cards usually had pictures of wedding cakes, with a topper of a man and a woman, or silhouettes of a man and woman, etc. The few that didn't fall in that group were either "to the grooms" or "mr and mr", but they all were meant for brand new couples. The interior messages saying things like, "Congratulations on your new journey!" which would be great, except they've been living together for well over 20 years.

So, on to papyrus.

SAME DAMN THING. Seriously, check out their website:
http://www.papyrusonline.com/greeting-cards/wedding-cards/same-sex-wedding-cards.html

Those are just the explicitly "same sex" cards, but the rest of their wedding cards nearly all have some other sort of problem with them.

We finally found a card wishing them congratulations on their marriage, and telling them to have a fantastic life together. It's simple, sweet, and gets the point across. 

But seriously? That was frustrating! What's worse is that they're pretty popular guys, and I am pretty damn sure that someone else out of their scores of friends is going to get them the same damn card! I mean, they really have like 8 total to choose from.

On the upside, the store clerk in Papyrus came out to us when we told him what we were looking for, and we ended up talking and laughing for about a half hour about the absurdity of the lack of cards for same-sex marriage.

So, someone needs to start a business, pronto. I'm delivering the business idea to you here. Go for it! Make some millions! 




 Hey everyone!
I am currently a product development/R D engineer for a fortune 500 company. I am not formally trained in engineering - I began my college career with a dual major in computer science and psychology, and at all times had to maintain at least 1-2 jobs (at least 1 tech job at all times) because of financial responsibilities. As the comp sci class demands got larger (80+ hours in the lab a week), I couldn't find a way to get the two schedules to work, so I eventually switched to a pure psychology degree because I could maintain my jobs and pay my bills while still maintaining good grades.

My penchant for working in the tech sector the whole time I went to school gave me years of experience, which put me over my peers when it came to job hunt. I found a full time job while I was in my senior year, and after spending 6 years there gathering technical certs, I left, joined the fortune 500 telecom, and here I am 5 years later.

The problem is, I'm starting to hit a point where the lack of formal engineering training is handicapping me. Some of the higher job tiers have education requirements I can't meet, so I can't progress. There are times when some of the decomposition and project management skills I never developed are hamstringing me. I feel like an engineering focused degree would be helpful. 

But then, I have bouts of time where I feel like I can't stand technical work, like I'm burnt out - I've always stuck with it because it comes naturally to me and it pays well - not so much because I want it to be my career. I have looked into starting a small food business, but that would still be years away because I would need to be financially stable and have my student loans paid off first.

So, I am now looking at the possibility of pursuing a master's degree. I'm looking to shift towards management, because I think it complements my psychology degree, and my technical acumen will work well in an engineering environment. But the choice is between an MBA, and a masters of engineering management.

The MBA is the more generalist approach. It works well if I eventually decide to shift out of the technical arena.

The MEM contains a lot of the same information from the MBA, but everything is tinged with a focus on engineering.

So, does anyone have either of these degrees? What information can you provide that may help me decide one vs the other? 




 Hey everyone. I have been unable to find a decent tab for this anywhere. I can find tabs for part 1, tabs for part 2, and tabs for the solo. But no one seems to have the full 3:25 8-track version of the piece which combines all plus the solo. Any advice would really be awesome. Thanks! 




 Hello everyone!
Last year, my wife and I went on our honeymoon to Brugges Belgium, and while we were there we visited their lace museum, and the lace society. We also picked up 2 pieces, both of which were well over 200 years old.

We would like to display them in frames, but I'm unsure of how to mount them. The woman we spoke with said that lace needs to breathe, and sealing it in will destroy it. Given they have lave well over 600 years there, I am prone to believe her.

So, does anyone have any ideas how how to best do this? I was thinking of taking 2 appropriately sized frames, wrapping the backing in black velvet (so it holds the lace in place without lots of needles) and then enclosing it into the frame.

Will this work? Is there anything on black velvet that could damage the lace over time? Will this make it too hard for the lace to "breathe"? 




 In 2013, the SCOTUS affirmed that police who are currently on duty have no legal right to ask a citizen (whether press or civilian) to stop recording or filming them. In fact, it is a clear violation of their first amendment rights.

Here is the actual ruling that was affirmed by the SCOTUS:
http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/spl/documents/garcia_SOI_3-14-13.pdf

So, why do we still see constant reports of people having cameras taken, film taken, people being threatened with arrest for filming, people being told they cannot film, etc? It's blatantly wrong and also illegal. 

I ask for 2 reasons - first, the events in Ferguson. But on a more personal note, last week I was threatened with arrest if I didn't stop filming police who were breaking up a large altercation at a music festival on a public street in my home town. Thankfully when I mentioned the case law and started asking for names, badge numbers, and they realized that I know both of their shift supervisors, they backed down. But why was this even a question? Why do so many officers blatantly ignore the law?

I'm not expecting every officer to be a scholar on constitutional law, but it seems that given the prevalence of recording devices today, this should be common knowledge. 




 Hey everyone!
I am still very new to guitar, so I hope you don't mind me asking this.

I picked up my guitar last week, and am patiently waiting for my teacher's schedule to be set (the best classical guitar teachers in our area also teach in music charter schools and colleges, so at the end of summer they pause scheduling new students until they have their schedules set for the schools and colleges).

In the meantime, I figured I would start attempting to learn some basics, but not go so deep as to get bad habits. I expect to start lessons sometime in september. So, in the meantime I've been practicing free strokes and rest strokes, alternating fingers, and learning the fretboard - all basic stuff that seems fairly hard to screw up. Oh, and I've been growing out my nails.

I am following along with this basic course:

http://www.classicalguitarcorner.com/level-1/

The lessons are brief, but they give me enough information that I can find reinforcing material around youtube to get a solid idea of what I'm supposed to be doing. The first time I've been genuinely confused was this morning when looking at the lesson about the Cmajor scale in first position.

From what I can gather, first position means you are keeping your fret-board hand at the first fret. But then the lesson stipulates playing the Cmajor scale starting with the 5th fret on the third string. However, it looks like there are a bunch of other places where I could start playing it - 5th string 3rd fret, 2nd string first fret, etc.

So, are these ALL the Cmajor scale in first position? Is one more correct than the other? Why are they called "first position" if the root note isn't on the first fret? Is it just a rough descriptor more than anything?  









 Hey everyone! Let me begin by saying I'm not a luthier, and am not even that great of a woodworker. But I think this could be a great way to learn a bit about both.

My wife (a professional music teacher) ended up ruining her christmas surprise last night by buying a manhasset music stand (the same one I was planning on buying her), so I'm now scrambling for new christmas ideas. So, I figured, why not try something a little different?

So, I started looking at the stewmac uke kits.
This is the kit I'm looking at:
http://www.stewmac.com/Materials_and_Supplies/Kits/Ukulele/Soprano_Ukulele_Kit.html

To tweak it a little, I'm going to be getting the grover tuning knobs instead of the normal friction knobs that come with the kit. Also, I'd like to remove the strips around the soundhole, and use some paua abalone purfling. They sell this:
http://www.stewmac.com/Materials_and_Supplies/Inlay_and_Pearl/Purfling/Paua_Abalone_Purfling.html

So, I guess what my question is - can anyone offer advice on skipping the strips that are provided, and instead using the purfling? Will the purfling I linked above work? How can I cut it so that it makes a nice smooth circle around the soundhole? Even some books would be welcome at this point. Since it's a christmas present, I want it to be a little more special than just the off-the-shelf kit. 




 Hey everyone. The wife and I are looking to trade in a good bit of gear for a new PS3 (Last of Us bundle).

Sadly, we missed the gamestop 50% extra promo by just a few days.

I know that in grocery stores promos and sales tend to be on a 6 week rotation. Is the same thing true with gamestop? 









 Hey everyone!
Right now we are looking to trade in our xbox 360 and wii, all of our hardware and games for what will most likely be a PS4. I want to be able to play Last of Us and if it ever happens, all of the older Final Fantasy games from PS1/2. My wife wants to play Kingdom Hearts.

But beyond that, well, I'll be blunt, my wife is a PITA to find games for. She likes RPGs and only RPGs. They have to be active combat without any kind of menu system (so final fantasy games are all out). She tried FFVII and determined that from that point, she didn't enjoy games with passive combat and menu systems. She is obsessed with the Kingdom Hearts games. She tried Fable 3 and while she didn't mind the gameplay, she couldn't get into the story (TBH, I can't fault her, the story doesn't get really decent until it is nearly over).

She gets freaked out by the idea of things jumping out at her, to the point where she wouldn't even play Portal because she had already convinced herself that something was going to "jump out and try to get her." Anything FPS for the most part is out.

She won't try fighting games, and she has no interest in sports/racing.

But yet every night she sits there looking at steam trying to find something to play. She's just too damn fickle to try anything because she's convinced herself she doesn't enjoy it.

I just don't know what to do. Every time I suggest something it seems like there's some reason it doesn't suit her. So, any suggestions for people who like Kingdom Hearts-esque RPGs? 




 Hey everyone.
My wife and I have an Xbox 360 and Wii along with about 20 games we are looking to trade in at Gamestop for a new PS4.

One of the things that I find attractive is the downloadable games that are available. I can't however seem to find a decent listing of all of the titles that are available on PS4. For instance, when I go to the PS website and search for final fantasy, FF:IX shows up with "buy download!" but it doesn't indicate what systems the download will work on. Does it work on everything? Just the PS3? Just the PS4? How do I know?

Their FAQ doesn't contain this info, so it's a bit confusing. Any help or pointers would be helpful, I haven't had a PS since way back when Playstation 2 was the big thing.

The reddit faq here http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/wiki/faq just says that the downloads have to be coded with PS4 in mind, but doesn't contain a listing of the games that this applies to. So, basically I feel a little blind. 




 Hey everyone. I've been on Robin Hood's waitlist for a few weeks now, and I'm noticing that it doesn't really seem to be moving at all. So, what's the deal? Do you guys think this is going to be a legit service or is it vaporware? They have a number of big backers, but you'd think they'd have SOME sort of updates on progress - app updates, news about getting SEC and FinCEN approval, etc. But nothing seems to be going out.

Just interested what ya'll think.

 Hey everyone. I am just trying to find out what a zencontroller looks like. I've recently sold off my old mining rig, and am considering picking up an asic from GAWminers. It includes a zencontroller, but I can't seem to find out much about what the zencontroller is, what it looks like, etc.

Is it essentially a rebranded raspberry pi? Or something similar? Can I connect it to a USB hub and connect multiple miners to it? Should i just get an rpi instead?

I'm asking because if I jump back into this, I need to make SURE that there is an ROI because unlike normal video cards, asics tend to not have much resale value. 




 I was super excited to see this in my messages earlier from /u/dogegiftbot telling me I'd won a giveaway.
But for some reason, the link didn't work... it sent me here:
http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/2c300i/winner_train_subject8232_has_won_the_dogegiftbot/

I was super excited either way, so I accepted the prize. I even got a message back saying I'd claimed my prize!

But then a few minutes later I got a message from /u/TheLobstrosity telling me that it was a bug. The really sucky thing is, I'm still seeing threads for other winners showing up, so it kinda feels like a slap in the face. Are they all bug threads? Or was I just unlucky? Poor form to tell someone they won, then send them a message saying they didn't win, only to turn around and have other people win.

I'm not bothering to re-enter. Thanks either way for trying to help the community.

 I know it's bad form to ask for advice on what to buy, so I am going to try and do my best to avoid that.

I am interested in these 3 styles of guitar playing:
-classical
-Spanish
-bluegrass

Essentially anything that contains a lot of finger picking. I love getting lost in the complexity it creates. I'm assuming this would point me towards a nylon string guitar, because that's kind of the standard for classical and Spanish, yes?

My wife is a music teacher, and is apparently aware of a very well regarded classical guitar instructor in our area, so more than likely I will be beginning lessons with him.

So, am I better off finding a guitar at the upper end of my price range that I like and is well reviewed? Am I better going to the first class without a guitar and getting the teacher's advice for a first instrument? Should I ask the teacher to come to the guitar store with me and help me pick out a guitar?

I'm just trying to figure out the correct approach. 




 First, let me begin by saying that I am not a musician. I am, however, a geek. That puts me in a rough spot because I see lots of numbers and knobs and switches and I get all excited. However that doesn't always translate into what will be a good instrument. So, I am hoping someone can help me with making a decision about buying my wife a wind controller.

My wife is a musician. She's a classically trained saxophonist with a masters of music education. She teaches general music and band at our local school district. She has several instruments - 2 saxes, a flute, a clarinet, a trumpet, a keyboard, and so forth. She also teaches lessons privately. If I had to describe it, I'd say she tends to be a teacher first and a musician second most of the time. She doesn't play very much for pleasure, but rather for teaching. Usually when she does play, it's at gigs for municipal bands or she's improving with a student.

A few weeks ago she was watching a music video for a mash-up band she enjoys, and noticed that their horn player was using a wind controller. She got all excited and said she really wanted one! So, I started doing some research for a possible xmas present.

I figure her uses will be: 
1) Putzing around and having fun
2) Playing along with private students in new and fun ways
3) Scoring music for her students - I'm not sure about this one. Are there any apps that will let her plug in via usb/midi cable and let her type in what she wants?

Everything I am reading seems to be pointing towards the AKAI EWI series. I figure the "playing along with students" part throws out the ewi-usb, so i'm trying to pick between the 4000s, and the 5000.

Since she has students who play several different horns, so I figured at the very least the 5000s has fingerings for significantly more instruments than the 4000s.

The wireless on the 5000 is a cool feature and will free her up to work with students and walk around the student. I'm afraid if she circles a kid a few times with a 4000s while she's checking out their form it will just make a tangled mess. I figure I will most likely pick up a mid-range keyboard amp to put in her studio to go with the controller. Is that a good choice?

I can't tell if the move from an analog synth on the 4000s to digital samples on the 5000 is a good thing or a bad thing. I can't see her using a lot of "beeps" and "buzzes" and she'd more likely spend most of her time sticking to traditional instruments.

I've talked to several other music teachers in similar positions and have gotten a wide array of answers from "waste of money" to "she'll love it!" to "well, she could find it useful with the right setup." So, I'm not getting much in the way of help.

So, I guess these are my questions:
-Given the use, is this even worth it for her? I know that's a tough question and probably a bit unfair to ask. I know she can use it with her students, and either one will give her the ability to putz around. Can it be used for scoring music too?

-I've looked around and a lot of folks seem to be pointing to "Sample Modeling Sax Brothers" as a "virtual instrument." I assume this would require her to be connected to her computer. If she were to use a USB cable to connect an EWI to her computer, would that be the only thing she'd need? Or would she have to have an external midi interface box thingies? This is where my ignorance is hitting me.

-Is a keyboard amp the right choice to plug this guy into?

-What are your thoughts on the analog synth of the 4000s vs the digital samples on the 5000?

Sorry for the wave of questions, but I just can't seem to find many good answers - everything expects a good knowledge of MIDI and wind controllers already. 




 Hey everyone. I am trying to find a way to purchase an amazon gift card for my sister-in-law's birthday. The issue is, she is a fairly lowtech person, and things like egifter and gyft both require the person receiving whatever card have either email/sms/smart phones.

So, how can I purchase a gift card in such a way that I can just print out the redemption code, put it in a card, and mail that to her? The way that Amazon usually does it.

Sadly Amazon won't let you use gift cards to buy gift cards, so that is out.
 




 Well, for those who saw my post yesterday, a few months ago I picked up a whole packer-cut brisket weighing in at 18.7 lbs. After splitting the point and the flat and trimming, I had about 5 lbs of fat, 8 lbs of flat, 6 lbs of point that. The point turned out incredible - it got corned and turned into awesome pastrami.

The flat had been sitting in my freezer for the past 2 months until I had time to smoke it. Well, I did that yesterday. It took 17 hours from beginning to end, starting at midnight, ending at 5pm the next day. I stalled for about 14 hours between 150 and 160. I was running into issues with my kettle (using a modified weber kettle with pitIQ, and smokenator) where every time I'd open the dome to add water/charcoal, the meat temp would drop about 15-20 degrees. It was a pretty extreme drop. By the time it would fully recover, it was time to add more water/charcoal.

Finally when there were about 4 hours until guests arrived, I wrapped it, and then the temp started to consistently climb. I brought it to 203 and moved it over to a cooler to rest for an hour before the guests arrived.

It turned out dry. Like, really REALLY dry. The only way to make it edible was to slice super thin, on a bias and against the grain so yoru teeth could get through it. Luckily I threw together our house coca-cola bbq sauce so that added a lot, but this was NOT the moist, succulent brisket I had hoped for. Tonight I'm going to take a page out of the pastrami book and steam it to reheat, and maybe that will add a little moisture back in.

So, I'm wondering where I went wrong. Is it bad to have frozen the meat? Should I have just sucked it up and wrapped it when it first hit 150? Do I need to brine/inject next time, instead of just using a dry rub? Should I have gone higher than 203? I didn't have time at that point to let it go until it was "like butter" but given the dryness I'm not sure there was much collagen at the party.

So, any ideas for how to keep brisket from coming out like cardboard? 




 Hey everyone!
I recently broke down a litecoin mining rig and started parting it out on ebay. I sold off both of the power supplies, however one has not been paid for. It's been 2 days. I sent the buyer and invoice, and I've also sent them a personal message to try and contact them.

If I don't hear back by tomorrow afternoon, I'll be opening up a claim with ebay. If they aren't able to resolve it, what happens? I assume I relist it, but do I get charged for the amount that should have been paid on my ebay statement?

This is the first time I've ever had what appears to be a deadbeat buyer, and I'm kind of confused about what it ends up meaning in the long run. 




 Hey everyone. I currently have an 8lb brisket flat on my weber kettle. I'm using a pitmaster iq110 (drilled manifold), a maverick, and a smokenator. I'm doing low and slow at ~225. My goal temp is 203. The only other mod is a brand new notch in the back right hand corner of the kettle to thread probes through.

Whenever I open the lid to add water/charcoal, not only do I see the dome temp drop (completely expected), but I also see the temp of the meat drop pretty substantially, about 10 degrees (from 160+ to 150 or lower). The problem is, I have to add water/charcoal about once an hour to keep things going. By the time the meat has recovered, I have to open the lid again and the whole process starts over. As it stands, it is 11:30AM now, and the brisket has been in the 150's/160's since around 2AM. I've heard of plateaus, but this is ridiculous.

This is the first time I've run into this issue - I've seen small temp drops with points and shoulders, but nothing this significant.

Any ideas what could be going on? Maybe the probe thermometer from the maverick is too close to the outside of the meat? Shouldn't carry-over keep the meat from dropping that fast? 




 Hey everyone.
I'm located in Pennsylvania.

I am in discussion with our local zoning board and a coworking space about the possibility of starting an artisinal coffee roasting business. As part of this, I'd like to do online sales, including accepting cryptocurrencies.

My biggest concern is the tax implications based on the IRS guidelines that came out a few months ago.

I see lots of resources for helping businesses accept cryptos, but I see relatively sparse information about reporting the taxes involved. For instance, https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/How_to_accept_Bitcoin,_for_small_businesses basically just says that they can't offer advice. Are there any good resources to help businesses handle the tax reporting needs of accepting cryptos? For the most part, everything will be getting converted into fiat while things get moving. 




 So, this may be an unpopular view, but here it is.

The NY regulations are a consequence of the IRS decision of how to handle cryptocurreny earlier this year. Most of this community simply said "ignore it!" 

Well, now we will reap what that ignorance has sowed.

Every single thing they have listed is expected of a company that handles securities. When I buy or transfer stock, every single one of these items is required for reporting purposes to the IRS. The same when I do a forex trade on an accreddited exchange. NY is instituting regulations to treat cryptos the same way, and therefore coming into compliance with the IRS regulations by enforcing record keeping. 

In the eyes of the IRS, every time someone opens a business that accepts *coin, they are effectively becoming a small exchange. Paying for a sticker with dogecoin in the eyes of the US government is the same thing as me paying for the sticker with some vested stock. With that comes regulatory requirements because they are trading securities. Every time someone creates a new coin? In the eyes of the IRS and the SEC, they are creating a new security and issuing an IPO. Replace the (insert coin name here) with the word "stock" and everything listed more or less matches what exists currently.

You can complain all you want, but the time to nip this in the bud may have passed. We should have been in an uproar when the IRS decided to treat cryptos as securities, instead the community collectively had the ho-hum response of "ignore it, I'm not a bitmillionaire."

The consumer protection angle will largely be used to sell the legislation to the public. After all, a lot of "bad guys" still use cryptos. Plus MtGox and the other exchange hacks will give them even more fuel.

So next time, try not to tell people they are worrying too much, and actually listen to what they are saying. Because it may bite you on the ass later. 




 I just took a look at dogechain.info, and noticed that we're at block ~302000. Did I just miss the halving?? 





























 Hey everyone. I am looking to drill holes in my weber performer so I can thread in the temp probes of my Maverick thermometer. I know I am aiming for them to be above the cooking grate (obviously). 

However, is there anything I can do to help reinforce the hole? Like, a small conduit or something? 









 I am picking up a full packers cut brisket tomorrow, weighing in at about 15 lbs. I am going to be making my very first pastrami. For the Corning brine, all recipes I find call for:

* 1 gallon/4 liters water
* 1.5 cup/350g salt
* 1 cup/225g sugar
* 42g/8tsp pink salt
* spices

This assumes a 5lb brisket. I am planning a 7 day soak. I will very likely need more brine given the size of the brisket. Can it be safely doubled? Tripled? I am asking largely because of the amount of sodium nitrite in the solution, and it's potential dangers at higher amounts.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_nitrite puts the LD50 (lethal dose for 50% of the population) at around 71mg/kg. If tripled to 126g, pink salt (containing 6% sodium nitrite) would have 7.56g total. That sounds incredibly high.

Any thoughts would be appreciated.

 




 Hey everyone! Simple question I hope - does anyone know if it's against the youtube TOS to put a tipping address in your video descriptions? I'd like to put a dogecoin/bitcoin tip address for folks who enjoy videos. 




 EDIT:
I'm asking about pastrami, not a Texas brisket!

Hey everyone! The wife's dad is going to be coming out next weekend to help us install our new front door. Thanks to her parents' lovely birthday gift to me this year, I was finally able to get the Weber grill I've wanted for years, so this is my chance to show them gratitude AND show them I know how to use it.

I'm going to be making homemade pastrami from scratch (from corning the brisket through bbq) and doing pastrami sandwiches because it's one of her dad's favorites.

So, my next step is figuring out how much time to estimate. I know with pork I usually have to aim at the 2 hour per lb mark because I tend to do low cooking (200-225). I also don't plan to foil wrap. I'm a bit concerned considering I've read the full brisket can be upwards of 18 lbs, but after the last BBQ session I've decided that if I won't sleep for 2 days I've got to make it worth my while, lol.

The corning takes about 5 days, and I'm estimating somewhere around 1-2 days of bbq.

Any advice would be appreciated on helping to refine those numbers.

Also, any recommendations on wood? I have cherry and hickory on hand at the moment. 




 Hey everyone! I've tried asking around on the food sub and haven't gotten anywhere. I'm looking for a recipe for vobla. Most of the recipes say that you use "salt and water" to make a brine, and then you dry the fish but that's all I can find. I don't know how much of a ratio to use so that it doesn't get too salty (or maybe too salty is what I'm going for? Ha!). Any advice would be really appreciated.

Sadly, I can't read Cyrillic so that limits my options, lol. 




 Hey everyone! Years ago I had the chance to spend a large amount of quality time with folks from Moldova. They introduced me to a Slavic custom of eating salted, dried fish while you drink a beer. Traditionally the fish that is used is "vobla." Needless to say, vobla isn't readily available. The closest I can find that matches shape and size in the US is smelt, but vobla has a darker meat compared to the lighter smelt. 

I'd love to make some. Does anyone have any ideas about what fish are readily available in a US market that could be substituted? 









 I've typed and retyped this post about 8 times now, and I still don't have it right, but here it is.

The problem is us. Our community. Right now, we're sick. When doge first came out, everyone was friendly. No idea was stupid. Businesses were launched to do silly things, but they got our coins circulating. There were the occasional scuffle, but for the most part everyone supported everyone else.

But now, when we're driving hundreds of people to our sub daily, you see people taking pot shots at people asking questions "because it's been asked 1000 times before." Oh, that's great, invite someone here, actually get them here, only to tell them when they ask a question to shut up and go away and read. How welcoming.

People post ideas on how to help the community. But then, instead of people actively interacting with them to see what the problem is that they want to address and actually taking note of how to possibly incorporate the good ideas, people attacked them. "You're a scare monger!" "There's nothing wrong!" "Oh, you're concerned because the dogecoin you spent 300$ for after being told over and over that we're **going to the moon** are now only worth 10 less than a month later? I guess you're not a REAL shibe!" "Oh, your online wallet got hacked? Sucks to be you!"

And devs, that includes you. People submit ideas on here constantly, and 99% of you are too busy putzing on IRC to take notice. Instead of people getting positive reinforcement for trying to help things, they get torn down by asshats who just want to shit on everyone else's day. Devs whine that they don't have help testing, or that a feature is *sob* HARD to implement. But instead of doing the logical thing and getting help, there are excuses about how "the source tree is guarded!" "We don't want just ANYONE testing these things!" So, you whine (and yes, it's whining) that you want help, but when people offer help, you say that they're not good enough to help. Well, we're a community and you can't have it both ways. Either everyone is valuable, or not. It's sad how the devs like to say that resources are limited and they're all volunteers, and yet there's not a single "Help us test X!" link to be found to get more help.

People make suggestions, and they get shot down because "OH DEAR GOD IT WOULD REQUIRE A FORK!!! THE HORROR!" Our coin is 6 fucking months old. We are a brand new product. Now is the time to try things and fork and get it to where we think it's perfect. We've executed forks before. The honest truth is it's not that big of a deal. Does it require some effort and coordination? Yes. But we've done it before, and we can easily do it again. It's just easier to hide behind it than to actually get things built. "Oh man, this feature could make us the number 1 coin on earth!" "Oh wait, we'd have to fork. If you think the feature is so great, go buy into that coin instead." "Oh, nevermind. I'll go try that coin then." "GET RICH QUICK FAKER!!!!!" I got tired of seeing this same conversation every single day. Think of this as a product. It can have flaws. That's ok. What's not OK is saying "the course is set, let's not change anything no matter what." You know what happens in the business world when you say that? You stagnate. Then you go out of business. It's pathetic that we have an amazing community, and our devs and a massive part of our community would rather refute almost every suggestion than try to make them into reality.

I'm not posting this to trash anyone. I'm posting it because your trashing each other and your ignoring new ideas and your not paying attention to one another and your NOT UNDERSTANDING EACHOTHER is killing us. Think about what you post. Is it going to bring people together, or is it going to drive them apart? Guess what, if it's going to drive eachother apart, STFU and go play a game or something. I don't care if you have 1 doge or a million. We don't need your negativity. I'd rather take someone who sold all their doge for bitcoin but actively helps people and treats everyone with respect on the trip to the moon than someone who spreads negativity.

With that said, even if you decide to downvote this post, try to stop being dicks to each other. Listen to why people are concerned, and instead of telling them they're dumb, assuage their concerns. If it's not working, then the problem isn't with them, it's with you. Your arguments aren't good enough. It's a chance to improve YOU and YOUR arguments. Maybe they have a valid point. Maybe their idea is really good, and that's the real reason your argument isn't good enough. Accept it, and move on and improve things. If you want our coin to be the coin that's different - do it by being the coin that actually responds to changes instead of arrogantly sailing forward just because you started out going that direction. 




 So, I picked this puppy up for 2$ at a yard sale, and it was almost completely full. Since we're going camping tonight, I decided I'd top it off. For some reason I thought I remembered it saying kerosene only, so that's what I got. Well, it doesn't actually say WHAT it runs on on the lantern, so I figured, what the heck. It's got whatever fuel the old owner ran it on inside, so at worst i'm making a mix.

That said, are there any dangers in running kerosene in a lamp made for coleman fuel? When I get back home, should I drain it and fill with naptha? Just trying to figure this guy out! Any help would be appreciated! 
























 Honestly, there may be some truth to that (I'm NOT a denier). Zyklon B was an industrial agent made to be a cleanser for sterilizing whole rooms (think like a field hospital). There were absolutely gas chambers, but chemical sanitizer was expensive and probably wasn't used to gas people when cheaper alternatives existed. 

From what I've read, several accounts point towards using diesel engine exhaust being used in the chambers. It was cheap and plentiful. Just hook up some engines to exhaust to an enclosed space with little to no ventilation and that's it, carbon monoxide did the work. Plus you could find any low ranking soldier and tell them to hook up a tube. There was no special training needed like there would likely be for a specialized agent like Zyklon B.

This is a horriffic thing to say, but if you are a Nazi officer, you are still trying to fit into a budget. Carbon monoxide from exhaust is far cheaper and more budget friendly than a medical grade cleanser that has to be purchased from IG Farben, especially when you need it to actually sterilize rooms too.

I don't claim to be a holocaust scholar, but it seems like it would make more sense to me. Then again, I don't know if diesel was rationed for the Nazi war effort, in which case that would be a strike against that approach.

Edit: After doing some more reading, it looks like both were used, depending on which camp. 




 That's not really true. People in China and Korea (ESPECIALLY Korea) are very cognisant of it. Though Japan was less likely to do death camps - they usually gassed entire cities (to be fair, gassing an entire city was way cleaner than some of the things we did to them - there's a reason why firebombing is now banned). As far as using prisoners - the Japanese were far bigger on conscripting prisoners and forcing them to fight, or using them for medical research.

We also don't talk about it as much on the US side because most of the Japanese researchers who performed medical/chemical weapons research on living human test subjects were given clemency and jobs working for the US doing chemical weapons research (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731). There was no big showy trial where the dirty laundry was aired like there was with Nuremberg.

We went so far as to then claim that anyone who accused the Japanese of such warcrimes were spreading communist propaganda. So, that's pretty much why no one talks about it in the west.

The only country that tried to perform legal proceedings for Japanese war crimes was Russia. 




 It doesn't. But it is a nice reminder that no matter how many horriffic things there are in the world, some things are still good and pure and wonderful. Like puppies. 




 +1 for the puppy picture.
Honestly, I love that it's the last photo in the set. After all of that darkness and horror and human tragedy, it's a wonderful reminder that there are genuinely wonderful things in this world.

It kinda reminded me of this:
http://thedailyshow.cc.com/videos/jtbjft/moment-of-zen---a-puppy

Edit: A little context - this was the first episode of the daily show to film after 9/11/01, and the whole country was reeling. So Jon Stewart presented a puppy to show the world that there were still good, wonderful things out there. 




 They did build gas chambers out of diesel engines because exhaust was cheaper than dedicated poison agents. The gas chambers currently at Auschwitz aren't real (they're reconstructions) but that doesn't mean the there weren't other gas chambers there beforehand.

The medical experiments alone prove some of the horrific atrocities committed by the Nazi war machine. Sadly most of the Nazi research was medical or psychological in nature, so we executed most their researchers. Unlike Japan whose research was mostly in torture and chemical warfare - we granted most of their scientists clemency and allowed them to continue doing research for the US (but without human test subjects). Kind of pathetic how that worked out. 




 Cognitive dissonance. You can ask a young-earth believer if they believe in the speed of light. You can ask them if they can see the stars in the sky. You can ask them how a 5000 year old world could see light from a planet a million light years away when technically that light should still be 995000 miles away. They'll attempt to rationalize to justify their position even though they know that their position cannot logically coexist with the scientific facts they already accept. People are able to handle cognitive dissonance incredibly well when beliefs are on the line. Basically, they don't believe it because they don't want to believe it, and it's easier to just ignore the facts or become numb to the cognitive dissonance. 




 I 100% agree. I too have a copy from pirate bay, lol. I think the most "useful" one is the meat book 




 There is a TED talk where they discuss how they made the book. The work that went into it - well... I will eventually buy a physical copy out of respect. Some of those photos took weeks to create. 




 It would be a tie between my Antique copy of Larousse Gastronomique, and a really interesting one called "[In Memory's Kitchen](http://www.amazon.com/In-Memorys-Kitchen-Legacy-Terezin/dp/0742546462)." 

Neither one is a traditional "cookbook". Larousse is an encyclopedia that happens to have a lot of recipes in it, and my edition, 2nd, edition still has all of the cool quips and jokes before the editors advised they be removed. In Memory's Kitchen is... different. It is a compilation of recipes, written from memory, during the holocaust by concentration camp victims.


I love both because the recipes are very often just general guidelines. They aren't like modern recipes where you are walked step-by-step through every detail. Rather, you'll see an ingredient list and then "assemble like a pudding" or "prepare like a cookie." They are difficult, and you often have to do work. In the case of In Memory's Kitchen, a number of the recipes were written by people who were terrified for their lives and on on the brink of starvation, so some of the ingredients make no sense. The difficulty really drives home what the people were going through when you try to recreate the food. 




 Came here for tacos de lengua, leaving happy. Seriously one of the very best dishes you can make with tongue.

The other option is braise it until it is shreddable, but do NOT shred it. Peel it and put it in the fridge for a day to re-solidify. Warm in a steamer until it hits about 190 and then slice as thin as you can and serve on some crusty bread with horseradish and cheese. 




 Go out of your way to do something nice for her and let her know that you don't want to be a deadbeat. Make a nice candlelit dinner. Try to find some free things in the community to do together (free or cheap concerts, go to a museum, go walk around a park). Worry about building memories together and not necessarily spending money on her. Get across the point that you are trying.

Make a conscious effort to improve your financial situation - all the tools you need are available on the tubes for free. /r/personalfinance is a great place to start. The folks there are incredibly helpful. If you think this could go for the long haul, you owe it to the both of you to get over any bad habits you picked up from being in a low income/low NAV family. I'm *not* ragging on your family, I came from a low income family too. Usually not having any money comes from bad habits in conjunction with misfortune - stuff like not having an emergency fund, not budgeting, etc. You can be the one to change that. 




 Did you see the tread watch while you were there? I want to get one but I'm still having a hard time justifying the price. 




 Hello,
I just received further correspondence from the law firm that they need my name, date of birth, my parents names, and an ID number (such as passport). They also provided a copy of the PCC-3 form that they say it will be used for.

I'm working on translating it. My concern is that my passport number in the wrong hands is extremely problematic. Do you know if I can provide an anonymized version?

Sorry to lean on you for this, but I find myself in a rather uncomfortable position. I understand that there can be real consequences of not paying the tax, but I also understand that the ramifications of people opening up international accounts in my name is very very bad.

 The danger in ground beef comes from how it is processed. In most American meat processing plants, ground beef can contain meat from literally thousands of different animals. All it takes is one bad animal to contaminate thousands of packages.

However that doesn't mean you can't do it safely. If you start with a single good cut of meat (or a few good clean cuts of meat) and grind that on site, it is just as safe as eating a steak. The key is processing at a restaurant (or in a home) produces a product that is far less likely to have a contaminant. 

I usually take it as a sign that a restaurant cheaps out on ground beef if theu refuse to make me a rare burger.

If raw or rare ground beef could never be made safely, how would anyone make beef tartare? 




 First, always ALWAYS brine chicken breasts. There's just not enough fat to keep them moist otherwise unless you are perfect, and given salt and water are cheaper than chicken breasts it just makes sense to take the extra step.

Then I usually sear for about 2 minutes on each side and check temp. If I am not at 150 I will ginish in the oven.

You can also heat in the oven to 135 or so and then sear to finish on the stove. 




 His duck episode is legit. When I plan to cook the whole duck at once I usually go his route. 




 Eat this Rock.

I never understood how powerful salt was until watching that. It also started an entire career of canfy making for me by making the salted caramels.

Followed closely by "The Catfish Shall Rise Again". 




 Hm, usually I cook the barley separately with some beef stock.

To get it velvety, there are a few things you can do. First, make sure you cook the beef low and slow. The gelatin and collagen need to melt out of the meat and into the cooking liquid which happens above 190 degrees (f).

After cooking, strain off the cooking liquid and reduce it until it is closer to what you want (French cooks look for it to be napp, which is when it will coat the back of a spoon, and you can draw a line across the back of the spoon with your finger that holds its shape).

You can also add some bloomed unflavored gelatin.

Once you have the broth where you want it add back to the meat and stir in the barley.

For the "not too beefy" flavor, use mostly chicken stock in the stewing liquid (usually ill do 3 cups chicken to one cup beef). Also when browning your veggies, add about a tbsp of tomato paste and about 1 tsp of anchovy paste. Cook for a minute or two until it Is rust colored and fragrant. Then add a little flour and stir and cook for a minute or so. 




 Probably the only one who will say it, but I freaking love pickled herring. 




 Go as big as you can afford. Lodge is awesome, amazingly enough so are the food network and Mario Batali ones.

For your first one I would HIGHLY recommend you get an enameled dutch oven. If you cook acidic foods in a cast iron dutch oven you will not only end up with some really nasty flavors, but you can damage the pot. If you were using it for short fast bursts of cooking it would be less of a deal, but usually you go low and slow in a dutch oven so it becomes a bigger problem. 




 I don't peel unless necessary for presentation. The skin is where a number of vitamins and a large amount of fiber are located so you're really doing a disservice bu removing it.

Just wash thuroughly. 




 Tofu parm.

Buy a brick or two of firm tofu but do NOT freeze it. Slice into 8-16 slices, coat with a mix of breadcrumbs, oregano and parmesean cheese with a tsp of baking soda mixed in. Brown in a skillet with two tbsp oil.

In an appropriately sized cooking dish, pour some tomato sauce (9x13 should work). Lay out the slices of tofu, overlapping if you need. Add the rest of the sauce until coated completely. Top with a generous amount of mozz/italian shredded cheese and some more parmesean. 

Serve with some pasta and a salad. 




 Do both. They aren't mutually exclusive.

Usually I use a rub as a dry brine. Rub the day before and include a good bit of kosher salt (usually for a 5lb butt I use 1-2 tbsp), and whatever spices you'd like.

Before cooking, pat dry with a towel and sear in a ripping hot pan on one or two sides.  You can probably sear about 8 mins a side.

Then add to your dutch oven, add enough cooking liquid until the meat is between half and mostly covered, and bring to a simmer, then put in a low oven (between 275 and 325) for a few hours.

Check with a fork, if it feels tough, put it back in the oven for a half hour.

Braising is basically foolproof. 




 Brine the duck. 

You need to give yourself as much buffer as possible because the breasts and leg/thigh cook to very different temps at rather different rates. Thats why most recipes call for breaking down the duck, it lets you treat the quarters differently.

When you roast whole you lose that flexability, and run into a very real risk of having the breast turn into cardboard by the time the thighs and legs are done.

It CAN be done, but you will definitely benefit from brining to give you some extra buffer for the breasts. 




 There are several things that make food go bad. Bacteria, fungus, and oxygen just to name the big ones.

The first two we can control via sterilization or pasteurization. Cooking essentially falls between the two (leaning a bit towards sterilization). The act of cooking essentially wipes out most of the "bad bugs" in your food. However, it doesn't remove any toxins or waste products that they may have already created. It also doesn't prevent them from coming back.

So cook first, serve later. If you dont think you will use it, cook and then freeze. 




 I have a dream of opening either a late night diner, or a public house. In either case, I know I need to better understand the "little things" about running a kitchen.

How do I plan a menu? How do I budget for supplies? How do I figure out how much to make? How are the different stations organized? How do I delegate work?

Stuff like that - things an amateur wouldn't know but someone who has gone to culinary school or hospitality school WOULD know. There's a marked difference between hosting a group of friends and hosting a ton of folks at a restaurant.

I have never worked in a real restaurant outside of a pretzel making job (and silly me didn't realize the meaning of the fact that it was the happiest I'd ever been at a job). I know these fine points are what usually kill most restaurants, so I want to learn them... somehow. My work schedule blocks me from getting a part time job at a restaurant or attending culinary school, so I am almost entirely self taught.

We have several soup kitchens in our city, and I was thinking - wouldn't this be a great place to cut my teeth and learn a lot of that stuff for free? Would skills learned there be applicable? I know most are on tight budgets, they have full kitchens, but I know many essentially serve from cans. It isn't perfect, but it seems like the experience cooking on a budget for a crowd is really what I would get out of it. Plus, y'know, the good feels.

I'm just looking for feedback from anyone who has commercial kitchen or restaurant experience who may be able to tell me how applicable the experiences would be. 




 Depending on the alloy though. Like, 300 series stainless, it gets exponentially harder to work with every time you do something to it. 




 Hey everyone.
A buddy of mine has what I believe is the metal gear solid legacy collection for PS3. However, every video/unboxing I find has the game in a plastic case. His case is Metal, very similar to the special case that came with Beyond: Two Souls.

For the life of me I haven't been able to find a copy of the legacy collection with the metal case, or any of the other collections for that matter.

Does anyone know what this is?

 Yeah, I do have to concede on that one. The price they get on the bulk buys of chickens is absurd. I can usually get a roaster pretty cheap but not THAT cheap. 




 You can make it better, have a little confidence in your ability to learn. Remember - Julia Child didn't learn how to cook until her late 30's and look what came of her :)

Cooking is just a collection of different techniques you apply, I promise, you are totally capable of doing it. I'm saying this as someone who teaches cooking classes. I have yet to meet someone who is unable to learn unless they've convinced themselves they can't.

 Just now watched the recent [NOVA episode on sinkhole formation](http://video.pbs.org/video/2365411270/), and one of the major items it covered was the formation of the [Bayou Corne Sinkhole](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayou_Corne_sinkhole). The sinkhole was caused by injecting water into salt domes, which slowly dissolved, causing a massive sinkhole several football fields wide, and massive leaks of natural gas to escape. Several communities had to be abandoned, still others are in danger.

The process of salt brining involves injecting water into salt mines to dissolve the salt, and then the salty water is pumped out.

It occurred to me that this process is not unlike hydraulic fracturing OR deep injection wells. Both are usually done in limestone rich areas, and limestone, like salt, is water soluble. This seems like it's a ticking timebomb for the surface. Yet hydraulic fracturing and deep injection wells are constantly advertised as safe.

Some of the events preceding massive sinkholes were bubbling up natural gas into local aquifers and surface water. Also, they were paired with earthquakes. I live in a state (Pennsylvania) with hydraulic fracturing, and have personally seen well water that reeks of diesel gas near fracking wells. In addition, the USGS has stated that [hydraulic fracturing is causing earthquakes](http://www.usgs.gov/blogs/features/usgs_top_story/man-made-earthquakes/). 

Is there another factor involved here that allows hydraulic fracturing to be safe? Is this just whitewashing a real potential catastrophe? What makes hydraulic fracturing and deep injection wells different from the processes experienced in the Bayou Corne sinkhole? 




 You know ima let you finish but no. 




 Whoever downvoted you is a moran. Paul Harvey was the man. I grew up listening to "The Rest of the Story" every morning/evening on AM radio. 




 I don't think so. Kaufman actually did some really cool things if you were smart/intellectual enough to understand it. Like reading Great Gatsby for an auditorium of people who wanted to watch an hour of him pretending to be a character from Taxi. 




 Just saying, your mom rocks. 




 Excellent - I'll check it out. Hopefully they're registered in the state where they're located... if not I'm guessing Delaware is a safe second guess. 




 USA
Pretty simple question I hope. How can I look up a corporation's charter, and legally required public announcement of formation?

Is there a free way to do it? I am basically trying to find out a listing of the founding board members for a particular corporation.


Edit: Holy cow, thank you all for the great responses! I managed to hunt down the company - they were registered in a neighboring state from where they currently reside. Thank you! 




 This could totally explain why it isn't shown on the w-2s then! I saw some sites (non-IRS) that stated it was only valid for undergrad education though, so it looks like that may be old info. 




 Thank you! Ultimately it would be a difference of a few hundred dollars back on our refund so I'd like to find out how to approach it correctly.

I can see the two reimbursement payments for the school which completely cover the cost of tuition. However if the school considered it part of income, then we should still get credit for it since you're not supposed to include income from your w-2 as part of employer sponsored education assistance. 

But if it's tax free, then we can't take it. 

But then I would think the employer would need to call it out on the W-2, right? It's certainly a head scratcher for me! 




 So, my wife is a music teacher. She finished her masters degree last summer. We are located in Pennsylvania.

As a teacher, she does receive tuition reimbursement from her school. However I have found mixed information about whether or not tuition reimbursement is tax free or if it counts as taxable income. Specifically, it seems to meet all of the criteria EXCEPT it was used for graduate classes, which don't seem to be tax exempt.

The riembursement is not marked off on her W-2.

I would assume that I enter the cost of tuition, and then enter the same value for the riembursement? If it isn't clearly indicated on the W-2, that would imply it was tax free, right? 




 Will rate up for dog pictures!
I'll see if I cant get a pic of my hound up this evening. 




 Well, the guy is the one on trial, not her. So if you can do anything at all to cast doubt on his case, you're not only sowing seeds of doubt in the minds of jurors, but in many cases you can use it as a strategy to appeal down the road OR for getting a smaller sentence.

In this case, you can claim there is doubt that he was the driver. You can say that her purse was on his side of the car. Anything to cast doubt on his guilt. Remember, all it takes is one juror to say not guilty.

In this case, it was pretty much rock solid, but in a lot of cases sowing doubt and blaming other people can provide enough doubt to keep your client free. The prosecutor then has to prove that those people couldn't have done it, and prove that the doubts are unfounded. 




 Heh, no. Nice suits reference though. 




 Anecdote:
When I was still in pre-law, I had an internship at a very successful law firm. I was focused on constitutional law. I wanted to fight "the man" and protect "the little guy." My plan was to work for the ACLU. OR, to go into corporate litigation and go after companies who wrecked the planet and abused people. But an internship at a defense firm was where I started.

A client of ours had gotten shitty drunk, and got into his car with his girlfriend. He drove headfirst into a cement embankment going well over 100mph. He was wearing his seatbelt in the driver seat, and survived. She wasn't - she was thrown through the windshield about 60 feet from the vehicle. She also survived... if you want to call it living. She suffered massive internal injuries, just about every bone in her body busted, crushed spine, etc. She had been a pretty, young, straight A student, huge dreams and potential. 2 years later when this was in trial, she was still in the hospital being put back together.

My mentor handed me the case file and told me to find a way to put this girl in the driver's seat. I saw the crime scene photos. I saw what she looked like beforehand. I realized I would be telling the public "well the truth is THIS WOMAN drove into the embankment! It's all HER fault!" I felt nauseous and realized there was just no way I could do it. I couldn't, ON PUBLIC RECORD, try to victimize someone who had already lost so much for one stupid decision. I read through, couldn't find anything despite some halfhearted looking, and gave the file back to the lead attorney and said there wasn't anything.

I also saw my mentor on multiple occasions literally get up and walk out on people who desperately needed his help because they couldn't afford to retain him for $5k+. Folks begging him for help. Folks who were beat up on at protests. Folks who got caught with a dime bag of weed and were unlucky to be faced with a DA who wanted to make a name. One kid was assaulted with a baseball bat at a rest stop, so he pulled a pocket knife and stabbed the other guy. The DA wanted to charge him with aggravated assault because apparently there was a juvenile record. And my mentor just shrugged his shoulders at desperate crying people who had huge chunks of their lives on the line, and calmly walk out of the room. He just looked at me and said "they almost always come up with the money when they realize you don't owe them help."

I have huge respect for people who can do defense law. But a lot of time there is either a blatant coldness, a certain amount of moral flexibility, or a certain amount of moral dedication to the idea that everyone deserves an ardent defense no matter the cost... maybe some of each... that defense attorneys have. I just didn't have it.

At the end of that internship I dropped out of prelaw. 




 Honestly? I completely disagree. Traditional power companies will try to put them out of business, but companies like Google will fight it tooth and nail because it would be significantly more cost effective to build a small power plant than it would be to pay for the cost of power for a series of datacenters. 




 She started out on classical guitar. I'm pretty sure she knows it already. 




 Hey everyone
A few years ago, I made absolutely KILLER cupcakes. They were chocolate stout cupcakes with a chocolate stout ganache frosting, topped with a raspberry.

There was also a filling that, if I remember correctly, was made with pureed raspberries, lindemans framboise lambic, heavy cream, and some sugar (possibly some other ingredients I can't remember). The resulting product was about the consistency of a pudding. It made a wonderful filling for the cupcakes, and the leftovers made a wonderful standalone dessert on their own.

For the life of me though, I can't find the recipe for it anymore. Can anyone help?

I have found these two:

http://ohmyveggies.com/recipe-chocolate-lambic-cupcakes-with-raspberry-cream-cheese-frosting/

This recipe produces a final product that LOOKS like what I made, but I absolutely didn't use cream cheese. The pictures are good for a reference.

http://www.beercook.com/details.htm?record_id=3d56c9a17e7637d7_97910

This one is CLOSE. I may use the ice cream base without the puree, reduce it a bit beyond nappe, cool, and stir in the puree to loosen it up to a pipeable consistency.

Has anyone made anything like this before that could help? Sadly raspberries are out of season so I won't be able to afford taking more than one shot at it. 




 I saw that... it honestly made me wonder if maybe she was playing rocksmith. Not that there is anything wrong with that - I also started with classical guitar, and I love me some rocksmith. 




 That sounds exactly like where I am! 

I have a classical, a strat, and a little martin... any suggestion on what the best to learn it on would be? The nylon strings are the most forgiving but sometimes it's easier to learn on the steel strings... 




 I honestly felt the same way. Especially when he had both of their weight on that floppy ass diving board. She seems cute enough, it'd be a shame for her to get hurt. 




 If you are doing individual stocks and you aren't an institutional investor, you may want to check out robinhood (not sure if it's public or if they still have a waiting list). No commissions on basic trades. There are some big limitations... you need to be using IOS for starters. And not all stocks are available. But for the majority of my single-company stuff they've worked out extremely well. 




 First, I'd see if you can get mom and dad to find a 1/2 or 3/4 scale guitar. It would be way easier to learn on. Not that it can't be done, but it'll be way easier.

I would stick with teaching music. Songs. Some scales would be fine. Teach her to improv on some pentatonic scales so she can learn to make her own songs. Kids that age are a bundle of learning ability and don't have the hangups adults do. Improv would be choice. Even just one or two notes and build from there.

Theory is simply beyond someone her age right now. There's a lot of abstract concepts that, while they have good justifications behind them, most kids simply won't be able to get (why are there 12 notes? what is a note? what is a semitone? What is the 12th root of 2? Why is A 440hz? What is a hertz? what is an interval?).

Send me a PM reminder and I'll talk to my wife when she wakes up. She's a professional band teacher for elementary students, but most of her kids don't start until about age 10. She may have some ideas. 




 I've tried the following:

* Arching my finger
* Tilting my finger so it's against the corner/side of the finger instead of the bottom
* Holding my guitar like I play classical and letting gravity pull my hand down on to the fretboard
* Just pressing with all of my strength

No matter what I do, i can't get strings 1, 2, and 3 to sound clearly. Usually 4, 5 and 6 sound ok.

I have really short fat fingers, so the area that is causing problems is really fleshy/chubby. Any tips would be really helpful. 




 OP needs to listen to the sing "Common People" by Pulp. It sums it up well.

No, you may not have money, but you'll also never have any idea what it's like to choose between food and rent, or what it's like to live on the street because a boss decided his son needed the job more than you before rent was due. You'll always have a safety net. A lot of people dont have that luxury.

I'm not trying to belittle your situation OP, but it sounds like you have a lot more than you realize. 




 Honestly, I use it for their portfolio builder these days, I can't invest in the individual funds as cheaply as I can invest via SB.

A long while ago when I invested in single stocks their automatic investment was a great deal. Not nearly so much anymore thanks to robinhood. 




 Pretty simple question. At the end of last month, they sent an email that they had an extension until the 12th of March. As of a few days ago, I received a new one saying they had an extension until the 18th.

What is the point of having a deadline for the materials if a brokerage can keep extending ad infinitum?

My account is just a series of funds, so it shouldn't be anything complex. Specifically, this is the message I have been receiving:

 As a result of the reallocation of dividends for certain securities you hold, your official 1099 tax form(s) will be available no later than March 18, an IRS approved extension. For details see the icon to the right. 




 "Quick, congress, I need approval to commission Motorboat 1" 




 Did you give him grief for screwing over Pluto? :) 




 As mentioned, this is a question about US law. This is mostly hypothetical, though it is also concerning a number of leaks about a company I used to have a business relationship with that have come out over the past 2 days. A number of people would like to see the company prosecuted for defrauding tons of investors, and the leaks are extremely damning.

To my knowledge, the constitutional protection against illegal search and seizure protects you from the government illegally searching you. However, another person like a thief or a hacker is certainly not the government. So if they uncover evidence of a crime being performed (suppose they hack into someone's email account), that should be admissible, correct? Because it wasn't a government agent who took it illegally? 




 So, my brother and his wife have consistently had financial issues. They are well over a quarter million dollars in debt, they both work minimum wage jobs. They have two kids that both have medical issues.

A few months ago they ran a gofundme campaign to raise money for their plight - as far as I know they raised several thousand dollars.

I am in significantly better financial shape. I use kickstarter occasionally because I like to help get businesses off the ground, and it's a great way to get fun art and gadgets for around my house. Well, it turns out my sister-in-law is using kickstarter too.

Daily.

Like - almost every day I get a notice that she has contributed to something. But then a few hours later I see posts on facebook from either her or my brother that they're hurting so badly financially that they don't know how they'll make ends meet, etc.

Then I think about all of their friends that they suckered in with their gofundme thing.

I really want to call them out on it. Should I? 




 Hey everyone. I got my LXME earlier this week, and it sounds great. It's meant to be a travel guitar for me, so it isn't super fancy. I picked up a strap as well. I have no problem attaching the strap on the heel. 

The problem comes up when I try to attach the strap to the end pin. It's about 3x the diameter of the pin on the heel because it's also accommodating a 1/4" jack. Working it a bit I was able to get it to fit, but there are still tabs of leather sticking out everywhere and it seems very insecure.

Is there a trick I'm missing? Is this normal? Should I just rig something else to make it work? Can I cut out some more of the leather to make it fit? 




 Hey everyone - hopefully this is a simple question. I am trying to send a letter to a Tax Attorney in Poland. I used the USPS calculator here:
http://postcalc.usps.com/

And it says that the product "international letter" for less than 1 ounce is $1.15.

Can I just attach 3 forever stamps? Or do I need to take it in to a post office to ship? 














 Any help would be appreciated...

 This should be a very simple request. I'm still new and don't have a very good ear yet. It sounds really easy, I just can't quite figure it out. It's just chords.

Here is a youtube vid:

 It seems whenever I post about something like it on this sub, I get rated down but no one is ever willing to offer constructive criticism to help me ask the right people. I'm just trying to find the right place to ask.

For example:
http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/2wubf1/can_anyone_tell_me_the_chords_in_i_hate_the_man/

No comments, just a rate down.

Is there a sub dedicated to tabbing or figuring out how to play songs? 









 So, I personally find I like playing with my nails vs using alaska piks, fingertips, or other fingerpicks. 

I've never really been one who had to worry about having a manicure kit, so I'm learning how to handle all of the care-and-feeding of having slightly longer nails.

What do you recommend putting in a "nail kit?" I've seen some for sale from companies like Savarez, but it seems like $40-50 is awful pricy for what looks like a few emory boards, some press ons, some sandpaper, some resin, and some silk.

So, for those of you who play with nails, what do you keep on hand to both shape, maintain, and repair your nails?

I've also seen the Mel Bay "Guitarist guide to fingernails" mentioned some places, but I wasn't sure if it's really worthwhile to spend the cash on such a narrowly focused book. 




 Just an esoteric post because it's lunchtime and the smells are overwhelming. 

Currently wafting from our work pantry/kitchen are the fragrances from an amazing assortment of different curries, daals, kadhi and more. No matter where I go in the building, I can't escape that incredible sweet-spicy smell. Every pantry is the same way. It's both divine and torturous at the same time. It's like standing outside a restaurant but not being able to go inside.

Does anyone else work in an office with lots of foreign workers? I can't be the only one who undergoes this torture on a daily basis. I guess I'll just softly weep into my sandwich :'(


TLDR: Indian co-workers are reheating their homemade leftovers, and it makes me want Indian food. 









 So, I know this song is simple. I have been playing for less than a year and have a really hard time playing by ear. There seem to be no tabs or chords available for it.

Would anyone be able to tell me the chords?  I can figure out the strum pattern from there. 

Here is the song:

 I am located in Pennsylvania, USA. A few months ago, on a lark, I saw a small bitcoin point-of-sale that was running an initial offering in a Polish Joint Stock Company. I had some play money, so I invested. Worst case? It's a scam. Best case? I help get a business I believe in get off the ground. The investment was in bitcoin and I had some bitcoin on hand, I figured what the heck.

Well, as of today I received my stock certificate. In addition, I also received a form letter, and  surprising to me, a power of attorney form. 

The body of the form letter:
 Dear Sir, Acting as the Board of Management of InPay S.A. with its seat in Warsaw (register number 0000512707; herinafter referred to as "COMPANY", we would like to kindly thank you for your interest in the activities of the Company. Regarding to the completion of the public offering, subscription and allotment of shares, hereby we state that on 22-10-2014 was concluded a contract of purchase registered shares of the Company, which shall enter into force on the date of receipt the document of shares, on the basis of which you acquired 10 Company's registered shares of A Series with numbers from 64122 to 64131.

 Therefore, please find attached to this letter the document of company's shares which is corresponding to the substance of the contract referred to the above.

 Simultaneously, we would like to inform you of the obligation to pay tax on civil law transactions in respect to the conclusion of the contract, which should be paid to the proper tax office within 14 days from receipt the document of the Company's shares, according to the Act of 9th September 2000 about Tax on Civil Law Transactions (you can find a consolidated text of this act in polish law gazette under the number: Dz.U.2010.101.649). In order to facilitate the fulfillment of the obligation described above, we would like to offer the possibility of preparing and filing the appropriate tax declaration with the payment also of that tax. **For this purpose we submit the attached power of attorney to sign, upon receipt of which we will make the payment of this tax to the proper tax office.** Please send this power of attorney directly to the law firm, which is cooperating with us, on the address which is indicated in the document of power of attorney. Sincerely (president, management board member).



The power of attorney form requests me to:


 "grant power of attorney to a tax advisor (name) to prepare, sign submit, and to represent me before the proper tax office in the issue of submitting the tax return no. PCC-3, in respect of purchase contract of the share/shares of InPay S.A. (polish joint stock company) with its seat in Warsaw (register no. 0000512707), which have been concluded between me and that company."

I've attached images of the 3 documents (including the sealed, watermarked share certificate). http://imgur.com/a/bSLUG

I have 3 concerns -

1. Does this look legitimate? Does it look like a scam? Having foreign nationals have power of attorney to submit taxes for me raised my suspicions a bit.

1. If it is legitimate, the sale completed back in November. If they want me to return it to Poland within 10 days, that's going to be nigh impossible. How much leeway is given? Is it only the postmark date that is important?

1. Did I open a can of worms investing like this? I figured it would be fun, but I have to admit I didn't fully think of all of the consequences of the investment. It's tiny, but still I want to CMA.

Any help would be really appreciated.


Edit: added emphasis 




 Sadly it takes having some extra ingredients on hand and a few hours of work, but one little (well, 6lbs) duck's sacrifice gives me the following:

* 4 meals (2 breasts, 2 leg quarters)
*  1 pint of rendered duck fat (no idea exactly how much, i used about 2/3 cup making roasted root veggies)
* about 3/4 cup of duck liver pat
* 1 quart bag of dog treats (rendered duck skin rinds)
* 1 quart of duck stock

IMO, it's the single most versatile animal for home cooking. The only thing that comes close is a pig, and I can't really buy a whole hog at a time like I can with a duck.

I wonder why they aren't more common in American kitchens? There's pretty much nothing to waste.

Sorry there aren't any pictures - too busy cooking to take any :) 




 So, I am trying to remember what episode this was. 

Basically, I remember a number of quotes along the lines of "Americans have it so good that all they can do to fill their time is complain about everything."

For the life of me I can't remember if it's the episode about smug, the episode about the economy, or something else. I just remember that the point was that people who complain all the time are people whose lives are so good they don't realize it.

Anyone have any ideas? 




 Hey everyone! My teacher and I have been working through the Parkening method book, and recently we added in the Pumping Nylon technique book.

I have been mostly focused on the finger independence exercises.

If I leave my middle finger planted on the third string, at first it was almost impossible for me to put my ring finger on the first string. I had to use my other hand and push the finger down.

After two weeks, it will go down there on its own but the movement to get it down there seems like it is in slow motion, and it almost never sounds clearly. It also makes my hand ache for a good half hour afterwards. If I move it up to the 6 th string, 90% of the time the middle finger comes up with it, even when I am consciously telling my hand not to move my middle finger.

Do some people just have really "stuck together" middle and ring fingers? Will I work through this? Is it a normal part of developing finger independence?

I was expecting the little finger to be way worse, but I don't seem to have any issues with that one. Just the ring finger. 




 A buddy of mine has been attempting to sell and then backing off of selling this guitar for years. In college it was his baby, so he is hesitant to part with it. But he never plays, so it jas been languising in his basement for nearly a decade.

So I asked him if I could long term borrow, and if he ever decided he wanted to sell, I would buy it. That way he could always get it back if he wanted.

Anyways, I got it set up, but he has 3 of the tremolo springs missing, the backplate is missing, and the tremolo bar is missing. I want to replace the missing parts (probably not the springs because I don't want to set it up again and it plays nicely).

I've found a replacement backplate, but I see hundreds of different tremolo bar options.  I tried reaching out to fender but got no response. Can anyone link me to the correct one? 

Feel free to use an amazon aff link if you want to get a few cents off the purchase, its the least I can do.

This is basically the exact guitar (sunburst with gold hardware):

 Hey everyone. I want to make black pudding for an Irish breakfast party we are having sunday. For the life of me, I cannot track down pig blood. None of our butchers carry it (going so far as to claim it's illegal for them to sell). None of the meat processors will work with us.

An Ethnic Chinese market near us sells quarts of frozen cooagulated pig blood. Every black pudding/boudin noir recipe I can find calls for fresh though (going so far as to strain out anything that is coagulated).

Does it matter if it's been coagulated? Is it TRULY necessary?

After researching, [pig blood curd](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_blood_curd), the stuff the Chinese market has, is usually just blood that has been left sitting for a few minutes to solidify and then it is frozen. The way to serve it is to cut into cubes and poach. Similarly, black pudding is mixed, cased and poached. So it seems like the processes are not entirely different. 









 Just curious - is this expected? When I launch through steam, it seems like steam has all of my profile info saved. But if I try to click on dlc, it tells me I have to set up "external purchases in steam." However if I exit steam and then launch, uplay works properly.

Is there any way to make it work properly with steam?

 In the exercise, it says that you are looking to snap the second finger on to the string to create the snappy yet even tone. However it also says that as soon as you have applied the second finger you're not supposed to apply extra pressure.

After playing with it, i've found if I completely relax the second finger while leaving it on the string it mutes, creating a nice staccato sound. If I leave it with some pressure the note keeps ringing producing a nice legato sound.

Which is correct for practicing the exercise? It just says not to apply extra pressure, not whether or not you should remove all pressure. 




 Simple question I hope. My bonus came in and I am looking to pick up a little martin LXME for when I am traveling.

Basically everywhere you look the price is the same, and pretty much all of them have free shipping. Are there any vendors that differentiate themselves by including a bunch of extras?

Stuff like extra picks, strings, etc? 




 Hey everyone. We have a 51" Samsung PN51e7000 plasma TV. My wife tends to be the one who uses smarthub, and lately things like netflix and amazon prime video have been freezing up, causing the tv to hard reset itself.

I've tried doing firmware upgrades and downgrades and gotten nowhere.

So, I started looking at the smart upgrade kits that are made available for smarthub. I know the sek1000 can be had for under $100, but I figure if I am doing it I may as well go with the latest and greatest.

For those of you who have used the upgrade kit - how well does it work? Are the problems with freezing apps gone (googling around this doesn't seem to be an uncommon problem)? Do you NEED to use the new remote? Does the new remote replace the old remote entirely, or is it only for smarthub?

Just trying to get a feel for the product and if it's worth it to drop 150+$ 




 Hey everyone.
I am looking to rebalance my portfolio over the next few weeks. I currently have about 1k invested across the following funds, with 50$ being added weekly and an additional 750$ quarterly:

* 7% - EWX (SPDR emerging small cap etf)
* 17% - PID (PowerShares International Dividend Achievers Portfolio)
* 10% - SCHA (Schwab U S Small Cap ETF)
* 17% - SCHM (Schwab US Mid-Cap)
* 4% - VNQ (Vanguard REIT Index Fund)
* 30% - VONV (Vanguard russell 1000)
* 15% - VOOG (Vanguard SP500 Growth index fund)

In addition, I am making the 3k minimum investment into VPAIX (Vanguard long term tax free PA Muni bond fund). I'm a PA resident, so it seems like a no-brainer to add it to my portfolio.

However, once this is added I will have to rebalance out my portfolio - the muni bonds would make up 75% of the portfolio. I want to try to stick to the Ben Graham 50% stock/50% bonds (leaning as far as 75%/25% based on market conditions) suggestions. How much of my portfolio should go into those tax free muni bonds? Should I look at adding another bond fund as well? 




 Hello everyone. I am looking to help diversify my portfolio by investing in VPAIX (a vanguard tax free PA muni bond). I am a resident of PA, so it makes the most sense for me.

In the past week or so as I was assembling the minimum investment, my sharebuilder account now seems to show that the fund is closed to new investors. However my fidelity account gives no such warning.

Is this just a website thing? Is it possible for new investors to be blocked from one brokerage but not another?

Checking on the vanguard website, there doesn't seem to be any indication that the fund is closed but I don't have an account there to really be sure. 




 I know the books were originally released in Polish, then the video games were made. I haven't played them, but the world caught my fancy.

After the games were made, the books were translated by fans and then official translations were released.

So, that said, I began reading the Last Wish 2 days ago. I've been surprised that the book is actually VERY readable. Not a masterwork thus far, but good enough I keep wanting to read more.

I suppose I am so used to video game related books to be... Well... Terrible.

So who else has read them? Your thoughts? Are all of the translations decent? 














 The caps are intentional.
Growing up, I was raised to know there is a difference between hot cocoa, and hot chocolate. Hot cocoa is based on just that - cocoa. Hot chocolate includes both cocoa solids and cocoa butter.

I can find tons of recipes that use just cocoa, but I can't find any for hot chocolate/hot drinking chocolate.

Does anyone have any decent recipes they could share? I haven't been able to find it since I was in belgium, and with the snow I'm going nuts! 









 Pretty simple question. I know they both effectively mean the same thing in practice, but can someone explain what nolo contendere really means to set it apart from guilty?

 I haven't been able to find an answer to this anywhere. Do the little martins use a nitrocellulose, polyurethane, or laquer finish?

I'm looking at purchasing an LXME for traveling, but I can't seem to get an answer about this question. 




 Just curious who out there has purchased one of these guys? How do you like it?

I am considering picking up one of the HPL little martins with my bonus from work in a few weeks for when my wife and I travel. I thought that it might be fun to pick up one with a pickup and connect a tonewoodamp to it for some neat effects while we're camping, but I'm not sure how well the TWA works, or how well it would work on a parlor guitar. 




 Hey everyone.
In june of last year I purchased a kremona f65c. I have been using the stock strings since then, practicing about 1-2 hours a day daily. None of the steel strings have any visual degradation like steel strings would, except you can see marks from the fret wire on them - specifically the steel strings. They still seem to be ok and are keeping tune just fine.

The only issue I seem to be running into is that g# on the 3rd string (first fret) refuses to play clearly. Where everything else on the guitar rings nicely, this makes more of a "thud" sound. I've had people suggest it could be a wolf tone, but when I play g# elsewhere it rings cleanly so that seems unlikely. Other suggestions were it could be the strings, or it could be a problem with the guitar.

So, does it sound like time to change my strings? Could it resolve my g# issue? How do i know what strings the guitar shipped with? When I bought the guitar the guitar shop gave me a pack of d'addario pro arte normal tension strings, but I'm concerned using them if the tension/weight is wrong because I don't want to damage the guitar (I know that changing string weight can cause other guitars to need to be re-setup because of tension on the neck changing the action, but a setup is less of an option on a classical with no truss rod). 

Do classical strings age faster or slower than steel strings? Am I due for a change? 




 Hey everone. First, an apology. I am a newbie when it comes to tea, and I am posting this using a mobile app so I cannot see the sidebar. I hope discussion of specific brands isn't prohibited (since I already seem to have gotten a rate down). 

A year ago a coworker gave me a box of tea - he called it "red tea". After some help on /r/translation I have found it is   (xin xiang brand tai guan yin tea).  It's a type of oolong tea.

I have fallen in love with this tea. After some research I've learned that the traditional varities count themselves among some of the most expensive tea on earth, and usually it comes in single serving packets. 

I would like to purchase more, specifically the Muzha variety (he described it as red tea, so that would make the most sense right?). I have had no luck finding the same brand.

However for the life of me I can't find much more information. I can't really go to a store and buy more, so I was hoping there are notable trustworthy brands.

Any advice for a relative tea newbie who wants to track down more of this awesome tea?? Preferably in relative bulk?

Really any help would be appreciated. 




 Can anyone tell me what brand of tea this is? It was a gift from a Chinese coworker and I'd like to buy more because it is quite good.

Hopefully this image is clear enough:

 Hello everyone. My wife and I are planning our vacation this year - a little 2 week roadtrip through the Finger Lakes in NY for wine tours, and then the Canadian side of Niagara falls for 3 days, and then south to Falling Water (the famous Frank Lloyd Wright home) southwest of Pittsburgh.

Currently we are planning to travel from our home to the Finger Lakes first, and while in wine country of course purchase a healthy amount of wine for our personal enjoyment.

My concern is about crossing the border into Canada with a case or two of wine, and then back into the US. I know that it really comes down to the border agent whether or not they want to hassle you about "personal use" amounts.

Since it would have been purchased in the US, do I have to declare it when entering Canada? Do I have to declare it when coming back into the US (we obviously will keep receipts)?

I'm just trying to figure out if we need to reverse the order of places we are planning to visit so the Finger Lakes is on the last leg, but we had really hoped to enjoy sitting on our hotel room's balcony, watching the falls, and drinking some wine.

Any thoughts would be very much appreciated. 




 So, for christmas my wife purchased a stationary trainer for my bike. I have been using it periodically since. When I set it up, i replaced my brooks saddle with the stock saddle for the bike, thinking the more race-oriented saddle would be a good way to go.

However, after about 30-35 minutes on the trainer, my groin/penis goes numb. Not "my foot is asleep" numb, but completely dead to sensation. Sensation comes back after about 5 minutes of being off the trainer and everything is ok.

I am, I think quite reasonably, concerned about this. I have heard about poor fitting saddles putting pressure on nerves to the side of the groin, but never anything that would directly impact the genitals.

Does this signify I need a new saddle? Do i need to adjust the saddle? This is the first time this has happened to me so I'm kind of at a loss. 




 Hello everyone. I am trying to verify the authenticity of what I think could be the first copy of a first edition of a book from a rather famous artist (Ralph Steadman). The book is little.com. 

While in Paris on our honeymoon, my wife and I stopped by Shakespeare and Co. The store is split into the main store, and a rare and antique books section next to it. Being an antique book lover, I stopped in.

There I beheld this guy. A signed first edition copy of little.com by Ralph Steadman, one of my favorite artists. Further, it seemed to match up with the books own claim to being part of a limited edition run of 300 books. Even more, it claimed to be number 1 out of those 300. Considering the price of 40 EUR, I thought it was too good of a chance to pass up and picked it up.

The imgur album shows off the book, but it also shows the part that has me concerned about the authenticity of the book.

The copyright mentions the limited edition run of 300. On the title page, the authors autograph is prominently displayed. At the top of the page in different writing is 1/300 (though it could be printed vs script). That would indicate that this is the very first book out of those 300 special editions. But its also what has me concerned. The only other example I have been able to find is this:
http://www.stellabooks.com/stockimages_sorted/384/384394~2.JPG

The numbering is completely different. While mine is in what appears to be pencil, the other example seems to be written in the same ink as the authors signature. Now, obviously Mr. Steadman could have started it out one way, and then switched over.

The copyright also mentions that the limited edition and the normal edition have 2 different ISBNs, but I don't know if the different ISBN is just the same book in alternative packaging.

Mr. Steadman is based in Wales, so it doesnt seem farfetched that a copy in that limited edition would find itself in Paris. Further, it seems doubtful that a book store as acclaimed as Shakespeare and Company would sell a forgery given a substantial portion of their business is selling antique and rare books.

I tried reaching out to Ralph Steadman over twitter but only got a confirmation that there was a limited edition run of 300 - not really a verification.

So - what is everyones thoughts? Could this really be the first, first edition of this book?

I tried posting before but automod removed it because it was a link to an imgur album, so I am reposting with a bit more info.

The imgur album is here:

 Hey everyone. This is something I am pondering. The wife and I are going to be doing our vacation in Niagara falls this year. We will be staying on the Canadian side, and spending a day in Canada and a day in NY.

I am not paying for international roaming, so while in Canada I will most likely just turn my phone off. However, when we are in NY is there any chance of my phone trying to go into international roaming?

When I am on the canadian side, is there any chance my phone will try to connect to NY towers?

I'm not near international borders very often, and when I am it's usually in Europe so I use my work phone. 




 Hey everyone. My wife and I have been looking to begin small-scale production of jellies, jams, and candies to sell publicly. We are in Pennsylvania which has some of the looses cottage food laws in the US, which is a great boon for us. However the department of health still requires that any food prepared in a kitchen be done so in a home that has no pets - we have a dog and a cat, and we aren't just going to kick them to the side. We don't have an in-law suite or a place we could put a separate kitchen/sink, so it seems like our house won't work.

I have investigated renting a shared commercial kitchen, but the prices are simply absurd. We're talking $25-50/hr, a minimum of $250, with a $500 deposit. So at least $250 every single time we would can or prepare candy. After purchasing jars, ingredients, and the time it takes we will barely make a profit (if we make one at all).

So, how did you get started with your food based business? 




 I've been playing since july of last year, so I absolutely still a beginner. With my teacher I have been working through the christopher parkening method books (still on volume 1). We have splashed in some other material (some chord work with folk music). I've been practicing about an hour to 1.5 hours a day. In addition, over the past month and change I have been mussing around with a strat that a friend is letting me long-term-borrow along with an application called rocksmith - usually another hour to another hour and a half a day.

However, I seem to be hitting a pretty heavy wall. My teacher had been assigning 3-4 pieces a week, though that has slowed down. Reading reviews, apparently one of the big criticisms of the Parkening books is that they have a HUGE ramp up in difficulty. 

I am up to about exercise 60 (Beethoven's 5th) and I'm finding that I just can't keep up. Working on that one piece all week, playing extremely slow (15 bpm-30bpm), and I'm only about half way through. My fingers just can't seem to find the right spots on the fretboard and it doesn't seem to be sticking mentally.

It just feels like my progress has seriously slowed down at this point and I'm feeling a little discouraged.

Is this normal - like if I just keep pushing it will pass? Is there a "hump" when you're beginning? Or is this a sign I'm doing too much? 




 I have heard this multiple times, and I honestly don't understand the logic or math.

So can someone explain where this statement comes from? 




 Hey everyone!
I know the echo has no battery backup. My plan is to use it as a replacement for an under-cabinet radio we currently have that is dying. I also think it would make a great kitchen companion. My wife and I cook a lot, so the ability to be in the middle of working and just say "alexa, add fresh cilantro to the shopping list" or "alexa, set a timer for 20 minutes" is fantastic for freeing up our hands when we're busy.

My concern though is if for some crazy reason we lose power. I know when you start a timer, it shows up in the companion app. If you start a timer and the echo loses power, does the timer keep going on the companion app? Or does it stop completely?

Second, my wife and I both have android phones. Does a single echo only work with the companion app on ONE phone, or can she and I both use it?

EDIT:
One more question - can you modify the wake word? I have heard several folks say that it can only be configured as "Amazon" or "Alexa" 




 Super excited. I'm even more excited having played around on youtube and finding some really creative hacks people have come up with to let Echo handle home automation.

I'm especially interested in using it in tandem with Nest thermostats (we don't have any yet, but it could be a deal maker) - something really cool about saying "Alexa todo - turn the temperature to 70 degrees" and having the thermostats all adjust automatically. 




 Hey everyone. Not sure if this is appropriate for here or /r/personalfinance, but I think this may be the most appropriate.

I work for a large telecom that lots of people hate - enough that it was caricatured on a popular sitcom. The company is in the process of trying to purchase one of its larger competitors, and in the event of regulatory approval, the stock could see a significant jump in value. That's all the information I can provide - it should be enough for most of you to figure out who I am talking about.

They offer employees an ESPP which provides shares at a price of 15% off the first or last day of the quarter, whichever was lower. This usually leads to a handsome return. The catch is shares aren't eligible to be sold for 1 year (I know there are tax ramifications with that short of a sale anyways). After 1 year, they're yours to do with as you please.

So, after years at this company I have a decent sized collection of stock, but my concern is that I am so heavily invested. Most of my portfolio is well diversified. But this one particular brokerage account - if the stock nosedives, the account will go with it. 

My speculative side wants to keep the shares that are eligible to be sold with the likelihood that the merger is approved. My safe side wants to sell the eligible shares and buy shares of an index fund to minimize risk. I have 4 quarters worth of shares that I can't touch so if the deal is approved and the stock soars, i will see some benefit. Also if the deal is not approved and the stock dips, I will see some pain when speculators jump ship.

The stock soaring is at least a little unlikely given the efficient market hypothesis, right? Outside of some folks who will jump in when they hear that the deal is approved but I assume that would be temporary.

Just looking to get a feel of what other folks would do in this situation.

My goal is long term growth. 




 I am asking this based on experience with piano. Many pianists have worked through the Czerny's 101 exercises OR Hanon - they're considered essentials.

I know Bach fugues are kind of a big deal, but are there any other exercise compilations that are common? 




 Hey everyone. I am working through my new lesson music, and one of the chords is an inversion of A major. It's played on the 2nd fret, 2nd, 3rd and 4th strings.

Per my teacher, I'm supposed to play using 2/I on 4th string, 3/M on 3rd, 4/A on 2nd.

The problem I am running into is it's a rather small space for 3 fat fingers, so obviously one of my fingers has to be almost entirely across the fret from the fret wire. It feels like I am choosing between having one or more strings buzz when playing, or I am muffling a string, OR I have to press with a death grip. Damn my sausage fingers.

Can anyone offer any advice on how I might be able to play this a little bit more clearly? It seems like it should be simple, but I just can't get it to ring. 




 After having yet another guitar-related post get downvoted within seconds on /r/guitar, I just wanted to throw this out there. Everyone's helpfulness on here is greatly appreciated for beginners like myself.

The folks on this sub all seem to be helpful, willing to listen, and always good for pointers. I genuinely enjoy posting here, and most of the time get great answers to questions I ask. Most people seem to have the same luck. Further, it's really cool that there is a sense of community and that we even have devs poking around.

So, just keep doing what you do. You guys rock. 




 Any suggestions? So far googling around is yielding a lot of "learn the pentatonic and major scale" which isn't really an exercise per se. I can play the scales around the fretboard, I am looking more for exercises on applying them. 




 Pretty simple q I hope. I use sites like amazon mechanical turk and microworkers to pull in a little extra cash. Is there anything like that built entirely around bitcoin? 




 Exactly what the title says!
What are your favorite easy songs that you learned really early in your career? Ones that you're still playing when you pick up your guitar presumably years later??

I'm still new to guitar - I've been taking classical lessons since june, and recently started branching out into jazz and rock on my own (with my teacher giving some guidance to help me learn chord shapes). I'd just love to hear what "easy" songs you never get tired of playing - things that are enjoyable to play - it doesn't necessarily have to be a crowd pleaser or some mainstream tune. Stuff you'd play when you have 10 minutes and are alone in a room with your guitar and no one else is listening. 




 Yesterday I was playing RS and I realized that none of my DLC was showing up. I exited the game and went into steam, and for some reason the game was grayed out as if it was uninstalled. I right clicked to check DLC and it said that both the game and cherub rock were uninstalled. 

I doubleclicked to install - it brought up a dialog that said "checking existing files" which took about 2 minutes, and the game suddenly showed up as installed again, and with it, cherub rock came back, and further all of my CDLC.

So has anyone else had this happen? I've never seen it before. 




 So sometimes I will have issues transitioning between chords for a particular song, and the game recommends playing star chords.

But then when I take the suggestion - none of the chords I need to practice appear in the game. So, while it is helpful, the suggestion doesn't really help with the song.

So, is there any way to specify ONLY specific chirds to show up? 




 Hey everyone.
I have noticed that on my classical everything sounds great EXCEPT the first fret on the 3rd/g string (A flat).

Where pretty much every other note sounds fine and rings clearly, when I play that fret it sounds very dull, as if the string was muted.

Does anyone have any idea what the issue could be? My teacher suggested it could be a node on the string, but are there other possibilities? I doubt it is the fret because first fret rings clearly on every other string.

 Exactly what the subject says. It seems like biologically it would be a disadvantage. The act of tearing the hymen would (at least theoretically) expose the woman to the possibility of infection. Tearing creates an open wound, often created by a foreign body entering the vagina (which should allow external bacteria to get by the normally acidic fluid in the vagina). Obviously this wouldn't be the case for tears that come from any number of other reasons, but still, a lot of females do have it torn via intercourse.

Are hymens found in all species? Is it a vestigial thing? 




 So, in light of the sony hack and subsequent threats of violence (and likely blackmail based on unsavory info gathered in the hack), I am of the opinion that this, along with drones, is going to be the way a lot of modern warfare is going to be heading. We all know (whether we want to admit it or not) that human beings are good at killing one another. That will not stop.

So, what are options for investing here?

I have a long stake in Kratos Systems (control systems for drones). I assume a lot of the more traditional players (general dynamics, raytheon, LM, etc) aren't the best options because they have more  traditional warfare solutions they have to attend to in addition to cyberwarfare projects. What other players are there in these markets? Are there other smaller players who are dedicated entirely towards cyberwarfare or cybersecurity that may be more nimble and inventive than some of the traditional players are capable of being? 









 The title says it all. I am currently long term borrowing a friend's deluxe players strat. He has done some minor work to it, part of which I think includes adding noiseless pickups.

The one thing I have noticed though, the pickups have what looks like metal nubs that stick out of them under the strings. Some of them rise out of the plastic block part of the pickup a few mm. Others are actually sunk down into the plastic block. Still others are about flush.

Is this correct? Should they all be flush? I don't have a pic but I can try posting one when I get home tonight.

The pickups look kinda like this:

 So, I posted a few days ago about rocksmith not detecting a lot of notes. I took advice from folks here and got my guitar a full setup for the new strings I put on it. No matter what, I'm glad I did it because notes south of the 12th fret are actually correct now.

However, rocksmith STILL seems to be intermittently ignoring certain notes. For instance, I can't seem to get 100% on the shifting practice track, as simple as it is. Half the time the 7th and 12th frets aren't detected. I've used my snark to verify that the notes are being played as expected (B and E respectively). There aren't any problems with intonation. Despite using HDMI I seem to have lucked out with having no lag (good TV maybe? or maybe the fact I'm using a HDMI 4 cable?) so that isn't the issue.

My fingers are in the right spot - at least with the 12th fret there are times when the note repeats multiple times with a few counts in between. My fret hand doesn't move, finger is placed directly next to the fret and I get a clear tone, yet only 1-2 out of 3 will actually be detected by the game. I've tried downstrokes, upstrokes, finger picking it, hell I even slapped it a few times out of frustration.

I have my pickup volume cranked for all pickups. On my mac I went into the mixer and cranked up the line in volume for the rocksmith cable to as high as it would go before I started getting a hum.

I've easily put in 50+ attempts now and it always seems like either the 7th or 12th fret has trouble.

So, has anyone encountered an issue like this? Any idea how to fix it?


**UPDATE**:
I seem to have resolved my issue! I made the following changes.

1) I began using the bridge pickup exclusively as opposed to the neck/center pickup on my strat.

2) I went into audio midi settings and verified that the cable was set as 48k audio.

3) In audio midi settings I raised the volume from the default to about 40%

4) In rocksmith, I changed the audio engine settings from the default 4 to 6 (I had previously changed this, but it seems to have reverted back).

5) In rocksmith audio options I increased the realtone cable gain from the default to 4.1

As it stands, I am now nailing every note.

Thank you to everyone who helped! I compiled together a bunch of your suggestions. 




 I am currently working on a seemingly simple piece arranged by my teacher. However, I am still fairly new to guitar. I'm used to chords being arpeggios,  not more traditional strumming/picking with multiple fingers.

What I am finding is that I have a very hard time switching between picking single notes, moving my fret hand and playing hand into place to play the chord, and then moving everything back into place for playing single notes.

Are there any decent exercises anyone can recommend for this that I can drill on? I know it is a fairly simple thing but I seem to be having a really tough time with it. 




 Hey everyone. I've been drooling over some vintage Gretsches in the store (we have a vintage 1964 country gentleman at our local guitar shop). One thing I noticed - it's a hollowbody, but the f-holes are filled.

They referred to it as a "closed hollowbody."

I'm used to archtops that have the f-holes open. So, what is the major difference sound-wise? Does it have less of the noise and feedback issues that a normal hollowbody has? Is it more or less resonant? 
























 The same could be said about the US. Folks simply don't like to admit that they have problems.

 Or the sort of searching-to-be-offended psycho who thinks everything in the world should come with a "trigger warning."

For instance, the sort of person flipping out about how horrid the recently pulled Batgirl cover was. Strangely they'll usually also be the same sort of hypocritical person who flips out anytime a book they like is censored, because *censorship is wrong*.

 It also can come from being under massive amounts of stress. 




 I was under the impression that most carnivorous plants ate meat to make up for a lack of nitrogen in their environments, not CO2. 




 Sadly there are a lot of really rich people \*caugh\*thekochbrothers\*cough\* who can't grasp that concept. 




 Well, govem we are willing to drop bombs on entire funerals full of civilians to take out a single bad guy, i think we've pretty well decided in one direction already. 




 Hey! Thank you for the honest feedback. I 100% agree with you on everything you are saying, and if it was something I was used to putting together I would totally be going for high end components. But my big concern is that this is the first one I am working on, period, and if I screw it up I'd rather have lost a 105$ piece of junk than several hundred dollars worth of gear. I'm looking at this as a hobby, and this is just me cutting my teeth, and in the future they're probably going to have way higher end gear.

I'm not expecting amazing results, and I fully expect a few mistakes, but I'd rather screw up cheap bargain-bin parts than really nice choice components. I see this guy being a schlepping instrument, that will be retired to a nice case on a wall when I build another one with really nice parts.

Plus this lets me trace the body blank on to some graph paper so in the future I can hopefully make and route the body myself. 




 Free cookies in exchange for potentially saving someone's life. Worth it. Not like I need all that blood anyways.

Plus as a male, there's [a body of evidence](http://www.webmd.com/men/features/too-much-iron-in-your-blood) showing that it's actually a good idea to donate blood frequently to prevent iron buildup in your bloodstream.

So, free cookies, saving someone's life, and extending your own. 




 Perhaps; there are many, many ways to add pauses - for dramatic effect or otherwise - I suppose anyway... 




 Thank you so much!
 




 So, followup questions - if a neck has a 56mm heel width, am I looking for a body that has a 56mm neck pocket? Or can I sand that down? Or am I getting the measurements completely mixed up?

Also, is it safe to assume a neck will have a slot for a truss rod?

Sorry for the peppering of questions - like I said, kind of still trying to figure this out. 




 Simple but good example: Food service.

Not paying sick days essentially forces a low income earner (the sort of person who would be working at a food service job in most cases) to choose between taking sick days to get better, or sucking it up and going to work. They don't have the option of choosing to go to work or not because they likely live paycheck to paycheck - losing a day of pay could literally mean no food on the table or not paying rent.

So, they go to work sick. While there, they then expose food and other workers to their illness. They also are less productive while working. Other coworkers become sick, and you lose even more productivity as the sickness spreads through your workforce. Customers potentially get sick, and if it's bad enough that customers track you down, you are exposing yourself to massive lawsuits.

Between a multimillion dollar lawsuit worst case scenario and giving a worker the day off with pay when they are sick - well, which would you rather pay?

I have a personal theory that many people have a difficult time understanding indirect consequences of actions, or maybe they understand them but have a harder time comprehending the spidering-out chain of effects that their actions create. Because sadly, there are dragons in those effects. 




 Honestly - I built a pinewood derby car in high school, and a stool in boyscouts. So, basically none.

I kinda thought an electric might be a good way to start, especially since outside of hardware and wiring it looks like I could put one together for less than $100.

I've also wanted a bass, and it looks like they have a few bass necks, which could be fantastic. 




 Well, was the tech wrong?

 Hey everyone!
I am looking to build out my workbench first, but after that I want to start on my first guitar build. Originally I had considered doing a ukulele build first (kits are cheap) to get my feet wet, but then some folks pointed me towards the guitarfetish warehouse sale.

Ultimately I want to build acoustics, but I feel like getting my feet wet with ANY guitar build will be a great way to start. Is this a sensible approach? Or should I just spring for an acoustic kit and ignore the electrics?

I think this exactly what I saw before - I thought it was just for amazon but I remembered incorrectly. Thank you!!!! 




 Hey everyone. I think I remember seeing a service like this before. Specifically I want to purchase a guitar kit from either Blues Creek Guitar or Stewart Macdonald, but neither accepts bitcoin (and I haven't been able to get a response when sending emails suggesting it).

So, it sounds like I need a service where someone would purchase the kit for me in exchange for bitcoin. I know I've seen something like this for amazon, but what about the WWW at large??

 You are correct, but it's important to note that those rules apply specific to "[public accommodations](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/12181)".

I still don't understand how the protection of sexuality isn't covered. If I was a gay guy banging another gay guy, and a business finds out and says they won't do business with me, they are essentially discriminating against me because my partner is male and not female. So it's essentially discrimination of sex via a proxy. 




 You seriously may have just secured my wife and I's retirement. We've talked about retiring in the Netherlands for years, and it appears this is EXTREMELY common there.

 Hey everyone!
I am a complete newbie, starting from scratch. So far I have the Bernstein book (I literally picked it up this evening) but I was wondering if there are other books I should take a look at?
My ultimate goal is a small setup for raising tilapia and growing plants, most likely similar to this one:

Any advice would be really helpful. I'd also appreciate advice if this may be shooting a bit high to start :) 




 You are both pragmatic, and a good dog owner. Rate up! 




 Which is why, to this day, I don't use dishwashers. My first apartment had a dishwasher, and I just put dishes in, and they never came out clean. My roommate advised me that I had to wash and scrub them down beforehand.

If I have to wipe them down with a wet cloth already, i may as well make the cloth wet with soapy water and just spend 2 seconds more scrubbing and be done with them.

The machines don't serve much of a point to me unless I have a sudden massive amount of easily cleaned dishes (cocktail parties are a great example) 




 It's the reverse here. My wife will usually grab things as soon as I set them down, often before I'm done. I usually don't mind unless it suddenly leads to problems like scorching (because I couldn't stir fast enough), or nice sear marks turning into burn marks (because she stole my tongs). 




 This is good advice, but requires you to have downtime as you go. That's not always the case. Especially if you are doing things that readily burn and require constant stirring. I'll give OP benefit of the doubt :)

 Do fulfillment centers exist for food products? I have been working on starting my business repackaging and selling spices. It's easy for me to do at home and ship, but can I tell the fulfillment center "here's a 50lb bag of cumin seed, customer ordered 1oz of ground cumin, please grind 1 oz of cumin and ship?" 




 Any idea how precise the scale needs to be? I have an older kitchen scale which is a bit finicky but can handle measurements down to ~4 gram precision or so. 




 If this is true, Drs. Sheldon Cooper and Leonard Hofstadter will be devastated. 




 Hey everyone. I have been curious about this for awhile. The actual act of buying/selling is easy. My big concern is making sure that packages get out to customers in a timely way.

I am still starting, so any volume that I would generate would be miniscule, and likely way too small for a fulfillment center to be interested.

Did you pay for custom packaging? How do you handle boxing and adding packing material? This stuff, if you go to office max or even the post office is absurdly expensive. Enough so that I lose any kind of competitive edge. The post office offers free shipping boxes, but the flat rate is really high - $9+.

So far I have just been saving boxes and as much packing material as possible from Amazon. Some guy I know also tried getting a bunch of free boxes from USPS and inverting them until he found out it was a felony :( 




 I don't either. It was always instilled in me early on that your pet is family. Not just "a pet." You've taken them in, they are with you for life through thick and thin.

 Not sure. I think the fact that people aren't driving the train, they have a big metal shield blocking them from really comprehending what happened literally a few feet away. Kinda like hearing about a murder on the news - it's ethereal and doesn't really have much impact on you most of the time. So instead to them it's just lost time that they're stuck on the train.

If they actually saw the body or if they're on the front of the train and they see the person hit, that would probably change their tune a bit. But maybe not.

The drivers and ticket takers are always really on edge though - it hits them pretty hard (as you would expect). 




 Well, it may not be quite what you are looking for, but I have been on several trains where a person has jumped in front of the train (you didn't specify the kind of accident). Usually you just feel the train screech to a halt. The ticket takers start going nuts and run to the front of the train. About 10 minutes passes and an intercom message plays that there appears to have been a fatality, and to please be patient. At that point you realize you are stuck for the next minimum of 30 minutes until another train can be redirected towards you. They pull the trains side by side so you can't see anything, and then move you over to the other train.

Other passengers usually flip out about how "selfish" the person was to screw up their day, and you question why exactly it is wrong to punch complete strangers for being such assholes who can't realize that their minor inconvenience was a day in someone's life that was so bad that it made them jump in front of a train.

There have been 2 times where I have seen the body. There's a lot of blood, and not much recognizable as a person. 




 When her only defense is that "she feared for her life" and the DA himself says that he never once pointed or directed towards her, his hands were empty, and she waited 4 seconds between shots into the back of an unarmed man, yes, exactly.

That's why she's been charged. 




 FYI, the camera from her tazer shows that he was struggling to remove the barb from his back when she opened fire. The DA himself said the video evidence is damning considering his hands were empty and he never once gestured towards her, and it clearly seems he was trying to remove the barbs from his back. She also waited 4 seconds between shots. Because,  you know, apparently the guy she shot once in the back was still a threat.

As for not responding immediately - let's try something. Have someone shoot you in the back with a tazer and start barking commands at you. See how soon you can start responding. 




 My god, of all the breeds, I think pits/staffies have the absolute best smiles. 




 Yeah, they "try to make it better" by threatening to stop policing if anyone criticizes dangerous officers, a la the NYPD. Police will gladly hold the public hostage the second someone tries to wave accountability in their direction. 




 Cop just indicted in Pennsylvania for stopping a man for an out of date registration sticker, pulling him out of his car, laying him face down, and shooting him to death in the back.

And the rest of the police that everyone says are "so noble" will be gladly paying into the union coffers to finance wave after wave of appeals to ensure that this officer eventually gets their job back with back pay, or at the very least, a full pension.

Because not a single goddamned cop actually wants to police themselves, just us "normals." 




 For a damn image. I know what I searched for. 




 No, I googled a creature from the game. I did not "google a spoiler."

At worst, I expected links for the beast to pop up. I did not expect the very first link to show the name of the beast's identity. 




 This may be the best comment I've read today! 




 Good dog!! 




 Um, that when I google "infamous beast" that I could find a picture, and not have the first result show me the identity of the beast? 




 I understand what you are saying, but I have to disagree somewhat. You're ok with raising for food lifeforms whose evolutionary path diverged from ours 50 million years ago, but not lifeforms whose evolutionary path diverged from ours 10 million years ago (dates are wrong obviously, but I think you understand my meaning). I don't agree with that distinction.

As for the land - most studies of the least harm doctrine have asserted that a mix of both animal and plant agriculture minimizes the actual loss of life. Remember that when land is used for plant agriculture, there is still a staggering loss of life. Native plant species are cleared en masse, and that often leads to mass starvation of native animal species. Rerouting waterways for irrigation can cause further damage in similar ways. The act of preparing soil, tilling and harvesting kills massive numbers of soil-dwelling mammals. The word pesticide is a portmanteau that means "killer of pest animals." So, even if we switched to pure plant agriculture, animals will still die as a direct result, even if we haven't raised them for it. And sadly, it's often in larger numbers than in animal agriculture (I'm only talking about direct impact, not indirect where the numbers go all over the place on each side of the fence).

There's not a simple answer to this one, as much as I wish there was. 




 I'm familiar with it, actually! Very good sci-fi movie.

Honestly, I suppose it isn't that far off.

Still, it's far better that the animals be treated well than forced to put in restrictive enclosures. I mean, ultimately, they are being raised for food. At some point, they will die. There is no way to sugar coat that. It's the brutal truth. But at least while they're alive they can be treated with dignity and given a modicom of respect, you know?

 Hey, first, I am a meat eater. So I want to get that out of the way. I also do my best to support small local farmers. I also hunt when I have the opportunity.

Do you feel that a lot of videos similar to yours that are heavily publicized purposefully forget to mention that this is factory farms that perform these practices, and NOT all meat processors or, worse, farmers?

I have family who work in the farming industry, and take their animals to be harvested at small processors. The animals are treated extremely well until the end. But watching most of these videos, it seems like names are often replaced with blanket terms. So instead of "Smithfield meats does this" it is advertised as "Farmers do this!" or "Meat processors do this!" Instead of showing the more truthful message that this isn't how it's done everywhere, the videos seem to specifically omit names to create a sort of "everyman" out of the industry.

PETA is notorious for this.

I understand that the bulk of Americans get their meat from factory farms (and these videos ARE necessary to prevent abuse), but painting the entire industry with the same brush also hurts those small farmers and meat processors who really do treat animals properly until the end. 




 Dear god someone needs to make sure this is the top post on this thread. Please. Contact your representatives. Get involved. For once congress is doing the right thing!!

 I know several cops. Most of them perform the minimum amount of range time required because they'd like to actually spend time with their families when not on the clock. Sure they may visit every now and then to hang out, but it's usually more camaraderie than it is for focused training.

Remember, cops aren't intended to be soldiers, they are intended to be civil servants. Not all of them want to be dirty harry. The problem is when you place someone who hasn't had that much range time or, more importantly, live fire training in a high pressure situation, their trigger fingers can get itchy - hence police racking up over 5000 civilian deaths since 2001, while only 1800 police officers have been KIA. In January of this year, 176 civilians were killed by police in the US alone. That's more than the average number of officers KIA for an entire year. That's why we're seeing sweeping criticisms coming down from the justice department because of how bad training is for cops to deal with those situations.

If we insist on arming cops with firearms (which is the only sensible course since civilians can have guns in the US), they really should require live fire training.

I wonder what ratio of those 5000+ civilians were shot by a cop who was a combat veteran, vs cops who weren't?

 So, where would one apply to sling lead down range and shoot poachers in the face? I understand and totally appreciate the approach being taken. It's the right thing to do.

But seriously, shooting poachers in the face sounds like a great way to dissuade them from poaching. 




 Just an advanced warning, do not google "infamous beast" or go on the Infamous wikia wiki site and type "the beast." It automatically redirects you to the identity of the beast, and kind of ruins the surprise.

 Molds are weird. Some science fir you...

If you have a layer of good mold, and a spot of bad mold, the good mold CAN overtake the bad. Or vice versa.

The real problem is that mold spreads through something called "mycelium" which is kind of like a plant's root system, except far more efficient at moving chemicals from point a to point b. That is a big concern. If the bad mold produces any toxins, they can absolutely get picked up by the good mold and transported through most of the mycelial network. 

So even if you cut off "bad mold" the "good mold" may now be toxic.

 A buddy of mine lived in Japan for several years. You are totally correct about their culture, especially so far as work goes, being very uptight, precise, and stressful. However, Japanese folks on the whole are also incredible at cutting loose after the work day ends. Japanese bars are a sight to behold after work. 




 Pretty simple question I hope. I have an extremely long commute to/from work (about 2.5 hours each way). Along the way, just about every day I see several old pieces of furniture on the curb.

After seeing the prices of some hardwood, I can't help but think this would be a great way to get free source materials.

My biggest concern though - pests. For instance, if it's upholstered, there is a chance that it could harbor bed bugs (they're rampant in our area). If I put it in my car, the bed bugs could take up residency there, and from that point it would just be a matter of time until they made it into my house. So, upholstered stuff just isn't worth the risk given that problem.

What about wooden furniture? What kinds of pests could I be bringing into my house if I brought, say, a desk? What mitigation can I do to ensure I don't bring anything unsavory home? 




 Oh my god, I was actually thinking of this last night. And here it is on reddit. /u/Niferwee, get out of my head!! 




 Just want to bolster this. In any time you are dealing with chemical exposure to living things, some are going to be more robust against the chemical than others. This is why in humans, when talking about material safety we refer to it in terms of LD50 (lethal dose for 50% of the people exposed). The same applies across all living things. Those who survive are by definition more robust against that chemical (for one reason or another). If they are capable of reproducing, at least some of their offspring will likely inherit this trait.

This is a textbook case of how evolution works.

 I do remember a ton of Russian/Polish/Moldovan places in Brooklyn  too (I had a ton of friends from Moldova). Great food, but watch out for those expiration dates! :) 




 That's great - but I think you're missing that Acadians WERE French. They were some of the early settlers on North America, and they brought Beignets with them. They then migrated southward where, etymologically speaking, Acadian transformed into "Cajun." So, like I said above, the French can still probably claim Beignets, but just not in mainland France. They're the state food of Loiusiana. Whereas in France... they're just another pastry. The level of emphasis placed on them is considerably different. I'm not saying this out of disrespect to the French culinary tradition, but Cajuns place beignets on a pedestal the French simply don't.

Further, France didn't "invent" them per se. The French beignet, like most carnival doughnuts, is an evolution of the Roman pastry scriblita. 




 You would think that, but check the wikipedia article for beignets - while the french invented them, New Orleans is the place that's famous for them (specifically Cafe du Monde). Heck, just google "beignet" and you'll see what I mean. They're the state food of Louisiana.

And remember - Cajun culture IS French culture, at least originally - Cajun came from ["Acadian"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acadians), early French immigrants to north america. So technically the French are still the most famous for it, just not from mainland France. 




 This is going to be a long post, sorry! I agree it is most likely a variation. My point is people are going after OP because it isn't "authentic," but this is one of those cases where you really have to question "authentic". Lots of other doughnuts aren't entirely authentic - especially not this style. It's a carnival style doughnut (made with all of the crap you had to clean out of your pantry before lent so you wouldn't get tempted). Just like fasnachts, beignets, kinklings, malasadas, and so on.

So does it match what you'd see all over Poland? Probably not, but that also doesn't mean there isn't a single baker there who doesn't prepare it differently. For example, here's yet another form, pczki serowe from a polish baker, in Poland:

http://sprawdzonakuchnia.pl/wp-content/uploads/ewpt_cache/960x640_50_1_c_FFFFFF_cfe767548249254abeae462fa0b2627d.jpg

That's still Polish pczki but appears completely different. Like I said - all of these pastries are variations on a theme: big fatty pastries that you eat to clean all of the lard and other naughty goods out of your pantry before lent. They show up all over Europe, so I'd expect to see massive numbers of different variations. Just because one family does it different from the norm doesn't really make it incorrect, just different. Most of these doughnut recipes were dictated by what was in the pantry. If one family was incredibly poor they may not have had fruit/cream on hand regularly, and so developed their recipe not having any fruit or cream. If one family was wealthy but still wanted to participate in lent, they may have had to cut the pczki so they could stuff everything from the pantry into them (a la OP). Most families would probably fall somewhere in the middle - stuffed fruit inside of the pastry, matching what most Polish folks are used to (a la the traditional pastry you mentioned). That's how these recipes developed. They're a big festival food that served a specific purpose (cleaning out the pantry) so variations are bound to happen based on all kinds of factors.

The whole "It's right!"/"It's Wrong!" argument in a recipe like this is like arguing there is a set ingredient list for ratatouille. In reality it was a dish made by poor people who made it with whatever they had on hand. Fighting for authenticity is a fool's errand because the ingredient list was determined entirely by what was in the garden.

I agree that there is a common notion of what the pastry should be, but that doesn't mean that other family's recipes for the same pastry are inherently wrong - they might just have a different evolution than the popular one. 




 TIL that most cultures have their own fat tuesday donuts. I have only ever heard of having fasnachts on [Fat Tuesday](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasnacht_%28doughnut%29) but apparently these guys serve the same purpose for the Polish culture. 

And if the dough is anything like fashachts (which, based on the description it is), it is going to be relatively high in calorie (about 500 calories) - they're made from potato starch water, flour, sugar, milk, egg, salt, yeast and lard, and then deep fried. That is just the dough before you add any kind of filling. In the case of fasnachts, they're usually either served plain, or covered in powdered sugar/sugar glaze/granulated sugar, and often people cut them open and spread molasses/table syrup on them. 




 At my old job, I was lucky to be across the street from a Polish deli. The food was cheap, and incredible. I also noticed that as I went back the portions kept getting bigger and bigger :)

If you are ever near Philadelphia, north Philly has a ton of Russian/Polish neighborhoods that you would love. 




 Relax. Pastries don't always look 100% identical for a number of reasons, and it doesn't always have to do with "legitimacy."

[Biegnet in Paris](http://voyages.ideoz.fr/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Berliner-boules-de-berlin-beignet.jpg)

All of these are donuts/zeppole/biegnets. They're just either different family recipes, varieties, or regional interpretations. I mean, New Orleans is supposed to set the standard for beignets, but every time I've been to Paris beignets look extremely dissimilar, and the dish in New Orleans evolved from French Beignets. Both are legitimate. Same goes with the donuts and zeppole. 




 These look like a weird cross between whoopie pies and zeppoli. I approve! 




 You got it!

 Nope, not yet. It's on the "to buy" list. I can borrow one from the father-in-law. My tool set is rather limited right now, though I am looking to expand. Googling router sleds - this could be perfect! I wanted to make a way wider than normal cutting board and 16"+ planers are incredibly expensive. This seems like it would solve that. Thank you! 




 The issue wasn't so much the cost of the wood (I can talk to the wife) - the issue is more that every plan I've found requires a planer, and outside of a cheap one I found at harbor freight for $280, the prices for planers quickly soar. I know I can plane by hand but I'm really concerned about how even I can get it by hand 




 Thanks! I had actually posted something similar on /r/luthier awhile ago and just got rated down. Didn't leave a good first impression, so I figured I would ask here :(

I will definitely look into a workbench! It looks like a really useful first project, and I'm pretty sure it can be assembled without too huge of a spend.
 




 You are *technically* correct, the best kind of correct! 




 Hey everyone.
I really want to begin woodworking, specifically with an eye towards instrument making. However before I start getting into really expensive tonewoods, I want to make sure I have an ok collection of tools and have some experience woodworking under my belt. As the title says, I am a complete newbie. Beyond a pinewood derby car, cutting some crown molding, and shop class in high school, I don't have much experience at all with woodworking. I want to change that.

I had wanted to start by making an end-grain cutting board, but when I saw the price of hardwood (moreso when my wife saw it) there was a very loud lack of enthusiasm. In addition, every plan I've seen required a planer which I don't have. I was looking at the prices of them and it seems like a hefty jump for a first project.

So, can anyone recommend some simple projects for someone who has very few tools and very little experience? I don't mind picking up one tool, so long as it can be purchased reasonably.

I have a 10" miter saw, a table saw, and a jigsaw (outside of the normal tools like hammers/drills/etc). Any advice would be really appreciated. 




 Yeah, ive seen it spelled out as AP cake, or apea cake. We used to have it all the time - I grew up in Oley, near Reading :) 




 This is not only delicious looking, but it is freaking beautiful. The downside is it seems like it would be a bitch to serve. 




 Damn, you are old. Thank god I'm not that old.

Until may.

...damn.

SCREW YOU LITTLE GIRL! 




 What the title says. I grew up in PA dutch land, but for the life of me I can't find a decent apea cake recipe online. My family doesn't really have one. Most of the ones I find online have a ton of extra crap that simply doesn't exist in Amish versions (seriously, they don't use nuts, they don't use raisins, etc). Any family or otherwise decent recipes would be very much appreciated.

For those who aren't familiar, Apea cake is an extremely dense PA Dutch coffee cake.  




 Ive found stevia is good in things that work well with an herbal flavor, like hot tea or herbal soda syrup. Anything where the taste is not herbal, it sticks out like a sore thumb, and not in a good way.

Try it in a cup of coffee, then try it in a cup of tea and you'll see what I mean

 Actually, they are. They're a cold weather crop, just like most brassicas.

 "Full-grown sprouts keep well on the plant in cold weather, making them a great winter harvest item for gardeners in the South (planted in fall). In cold climates, gardeners often bury Brussels sprouts plants up to their tops in hay or leaves in late fall, then pull off the little sprouts as needed through winter."

 First, I'd see if you are near an Indian grocer. A lot of times they have spices in whole form that can then be ground fresh in the home. Whole spices last MUCH longer than ground. Plus at ethnic markets you can buy them in reasonable bulk for a fraction of the price. For instance, instead of buying ground ginger (which could already be a year or more old when you pick it off the shelf so it has very little flavor), go to the indian market, pay a fraction of the price for whole dried ginger and throw it in a spice grinder when you need it.

The same goes with turmeric, dried chilies, cinnamon, black peppercorns, nutmeg, allspice, cloves, etc - there are a bunch available. Just eyeball what you think you'll need and grind up a little more. Grab a few spice containers (or save the ones you have now) to put leftovers in.

You end up paying less for a more stable product that produces superior results. 




 Root parsley is amazing. It's like carrots, celery, and parsley had a 3-way baby. It's definitely worth trying if you can find it.

 Ahh, I too have to deal with the non-dairy non-gluten vegetarian challenge every time our friends get together. Here is a personal favorite (recipe based on the 2nd issue of Co-Operative magazine, but with some personal flare). The whole thing takes maybe a half hour with prep.

**Citrus Curd**

* Finely grated zest of 3 citrus fruits (at least 1 lemon)
* Juice of those 3 fruits (again, at least 1 lemon)
* 3 large eggs
* 2 free range egg yolks
* 175g caster sugar (just throw regular sugar into a food processor for 1 minute, don't waste money buying it)
* 100g unsalted butter cut in chunks

**Optional meringue:**

* Reserve the 2 whites from the yolks above
* 100g additional caster sugar
* pinch cream of tartar
* 1.5tsp cornstarch dissolved into 2 tbsp of water

Bring a pot of water to a boil, and grab a large mixing bowl that can be set over top. A double boiler works well too. Whisk together the juice, zest, 175g sugar, eggs, and yolks and place the double boiler/bowl over the boiling water, making sure it is not in contact with the water. Add the butter and keep whisking. Once the butter has melted, keep stirring until thickened (the specific term you are looking for here is nappe, when the curd can coat the back of a spoon, and when you can see trails where the whisk has been). This should be about 175 to 180 (do NOT go beyond that).

Use your eyes and see if there are any chunks of curdled eggs. If so, strain through a sieve. Serve into single serving ramekins or cups. Allow to cool. 

**Optional:** Before serving, whisk the reserved eggwhites with the cornstarch slurry and a pinch of cream of tartar until they are at soft peaks (cornstarch will prevent the meringue from sweating if it sits out for awhile). Add the remaining 100g of caster sugar slowly while whisking. Bring to stiff peaks. Place a dollop on top of the curd and and hit with a blowtorch to brown the meringue. Be really careful if doing this in plastic serving dishes. It may also be a good idea to use pasteurized eggs if you take this route.

The scale and induction cooktop are must haves, the rest just make life faster and easier  




 Cooking is just a set of simple techniques you combine. There are very few "single use" techniques out there.

Also, there are no set ingredients on provincial food. Poor people used what they had. Don't worry about "authentic" ingredients because poor people didn't usually have the luxury of being choosy. Trying to be authentic usually makes dishes inauthentic. 




 Chickpea tuna salad. Mash up canned chickpeas with a potato masher or fork. Treat like tuna and make "tuna salad". Serve on pitas or rolls. 




 Hey everyone. I am growing these in the garden for the first time this year (my garden is going fallow for a year to get rid of some pest infestations and give some fungal problems a year to die away).

I fully expect to have a ton of the buttons on hand - I'm sowing a ton of seeds. However I can find very little on how to store the buttons for the long term.

Can they be dried? Can I freeze them?

I will probably xpost this in /r/gardening because it kind of straddles discussion about gardening and how to store an ingredient. 




 Eh, not my thing but if it gets a few more folks to make music, why not.

Sure it's lazy, but I can see some folks being interested if they have muscle problems or just lack the confidence. 




 One does not simply.... see what a helicopter can do. 




 Thank you so much, you've been a big help! 

After more research, I am thinking of picking up some cheap "project" or otherwise broken guitars on ebay to get started. I figure it will let me know the lay of the land, and I can start to build up the tools organically as I fix things. Maybe I can even make a few bucks once I get better at it.

Again, thank you a lot. 




 No idea :( 




 Ordered on the 13th of January, ship date is between May 27th and July 2nd.

After getting frustrated by reading people who placed their orders a week ago get ship dates a month sooner than me, I called amazon to find out what was going on. Apparently their order systems are overloaded and aren't really built to handle this sort of massive backorder. They're working to resolve it, but if you ordered in the past 2 weeks your shipping time may be off quite a bit. 




 Groovy! At the very least, it'll make the bottom drop out on the SEK-2000 kits :) 




 Hey everyone. I really want to take a stab at a kit guitar to get started. I've been looking at Blues Creek guitar kits, and they seem to have fantastic support.

I know I need to get some hand tools, but the one thing I am most concerned about is either buying or building a binding jig. Is this necessary? I'm trying to make my first build as affordable as possible because there's a good chance I'll cock it up somehow :)

Are there any other required tools that I really need to get started? I know i need to get a jigsaw - I have a tablesaw to build some of the jigs if necessary (even if they won't be beautiful). 




 I ordered mine on January 12th, and was given an estimate of May 27th to July 2nd. Wtf. 




 First, I'll probably get rated down for this, but frankly my karma is skyhigh and I really don't care.

Is anyone else a bit frustrated with how this rollout is going? I ordered as soon as I realized an invite was available to me (it went into my spam bucket for a few days), and was given an estimate of May 27th to July 2nd. Now, I see posts [like this](http://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/2ygdx9/question_about_wait_time_for_echo_invite/) that show an estimate from May 20th to June 15th. I placed my order on January 12th. Why the hell is a user who ordered a week ago receiving a unit ahead of me?

Last night there was a post that Amazon is [making refurb units available](http://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/2zn7s4/fyi_refurbished_units_are_available_for/) but there are still tons of users who haven't even gotten new units yet.

If they have refurb units available, why aren't they making it an option for users who have been waiting for months now? Especially when they're going to let new buyers seemingly get bumped to the head of the line.

On top of it, when I and another user "dared" to comment on that thread about how it was frustrating, we both got downvoted to hell.

This rollout is incredibly frustrating, and it seems like people on this sub are perfectly happy to downvote anyone who mentions it. 




 Not to threadjack, but did he mention anything about 2012 sets? Sammy promised 4 years of updates, and 5 years of support. So far the only specs I've seen on the SEK-3000 are that it supports f-series and higher. I have a 51" e7000 and can't find much of anything about it. 




 I wonder how it would fare in conjunction with chamomile? 




 Trey and Matt got tired of it, thats why they started southparkstudios.com so you can watch the series for free. 




 Good. Fark them and any other idiots who think that suing the people who support you is a good idea. 




 Alone in the world is a little catdog :( 




 Yup, its open to all. They will ask if you have a business or if its for personal use. They are literally next door to another store called restaurant depot that requires an affiliation. Guess which one usually has a full parking lot :) because it gets them lots of business, I dont think they have any plans to change.

I go there to get stuff like trays, cooling racks, bone cleavers and other knives that are meant to get beat to hell, pizza peels, graduated food storage containers, etc.

About 3/4ths of the place is equipment, 1/4th is canned goods, mixes, yeasts, etc. 




 Kinda frustrating that they have refurb stock when I am still backordered from late may to late july.  




 Dear OP, I'm guessing you're across the world from me, but if I am ever in the same country would you mind giving me a ride? I'll pay for fuel and help you with the preflight checklist. I love flying. I especially love flying like this. 




 Yeah, that's basically how it tastes. It's an interesting cheese because unlike most other cheeses that are made from curd, gjetost is made by simmering leftover whey down for hours until it turns to sludge. The caramel flavor and sweetness comes from the whey caramelizing. It should be sliced really thin. It goes great on crackers or with toast for breakfast, but I'm a cheese geek, lol.

 Hmm... well... what has he been most interested in? Is he looking for recipes, or science, or techniques? "The Professional Chef" from the CIA is a killer book if he's interested in learning techniques along with recipes.

If you don't have it, see if you can get a copy of the Fannie Farmer Cookbook (or if you're really lucky, a copy of the Boston School of Cooking Cookbook - they're the same thing, but the Boston one is the much older name).

Another thing you could try - see if there are any library or charity book sales in the area. A lot of times you can find tons of cookbooks for cheap - you can grab a bunch and see if any tickle his fancy. 




 Google "donburi" and go wild. They're fantastic dishes that are entirely centered around rice. Usually, it's rice with some kind of enchanting broth or gravy poured over it.

Also, learn to cook some Indian food :) 




 It sounds like you're talking about gjetost, and I've never heard of someone not liking it before. That's sad :(

 Mama mia!

Seriously though, it goes excellent in soup. Make some chicken broth and bring it to a simmer. Slice escarole into 1/4 inch strips and add into broth (you can also wilt it in another pan, but meh to extra dishes). Season with salt and pepper.

If you want to go really fancy, you can add some pasta, chunk up some parmesean/ramano rinds, and small parbroiled meatballs (place them under a broiler for about 1-2 minutes, not long) to your soup. You'll have essentially created a very simple italian wedding soup. 




 Your recipe seems correct. However you are missing one last step - you have to "fluff" couscous after you have cooked it. Take a fork (or rice paddle) or two and start to toss it around in the bowl and then transfer to another container. 

If it seems really dry, you can boil more liquid and pour it into the couscous and re-cover for a few more minutes. Then fluff again. This becomes important when you're making really large amounts of it (like if you are using it to stuff a crown rack or something) because the ratios get weird.

It's really easy stuff to work with. Try not to overthink it :) 




 Depends how it's been made. If it's fairly plain, I'd say, mash it up add an egg or two, a tbsp or two of milk, and 2 slices of white bread that are ground up (you may need to adjust this). Shape into disks and fry. Improvised latkes. Serve with sour cream.

Or trade it to some of your college buddies in exchange for beer. Then drink the beer. 




 It's also great for other college activities. Going camping for the weekend? Bring your skillet. The best part about cast iron is the damn things are nigh indestructible. 




 If you are near northern NJ, the Allentown/Bethlehem/Easton PA area has a chain called "The Restaurant Store" that doesn't require an affiliation. Should be about an hour and a half from you. I'm lucky to live about 10 minutes away.

http://www.therestaurantstore.com/

It's worth the trip if you want to stock up on stuff. 




 Another reason you missed - you can't put nonstick cookware in dishwashers. Most decent sized kitchens will have industrial dishwashers these days. 




 Cast iron. It doubles as a weapon that can be used in self-defense. 




 *twitch* 




 You slap him and take it back. Knife abuse is not allowed on /r/cooking. 




 Yup, this is pretty much all you need to do. Usually I do this after using my ice cream maker anyway (because my kitchenaid mixer ice cream maker sucks and I really miss my old donvier handcrank one).

Usually I make it first thing in the morning, and set a timer every 30 minutes. When it goes off, scrape it up and stir it. Repeat until it's a nice smooth texture. Your goal is to prevent large ice crystals from forming. 




 I'd pick up the Good Eats series for him. If he already has it, pick out a few of the Americas Test Kitchen/Cook's Illustrated/Cook's Country season cook books. 




 Interesting, I'll take a look.
Honestly, a lot of it comes down to semantic arguments. There were gas chambers. They were used. People were gassed to death. Whether it was carbon monoxide or HCN, it doesn't really matter. Fact is, folks were murdered en masse.

Edit: Interesting - it looks like both were used. Auschwitz/Birkenau used HCN, most of the others used exhaust. I guess it really supports the reputation of auschwitz being a death factory :(
