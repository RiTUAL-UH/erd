 do you happen to sell propane and propane accessories? 




 If you could change your name to one in spanish, what would you choose, and what last name would you choose? 




 The foolish man stays and videotapes. 




 but remember they're
as effective as a sheepskin condom on Magic Johnson 




 For you and for those who don't know, I'm sorry to say, its reference to a video of a guy who has sex with a horse, then dies of the injuries. It's from a video. 









 why is there a dildo in it's mouth? 




 If I had that bag, I would put the handle on my face and use it as a mask 




 lol cool 




 I also love Ranch Dressing 




 Dude you are gonna get shot by a cop in self defense cause theyre gonna feel threatened by your shirt. 




 that's some vandalism we can appreciate 




 His level is over 9000! 




 A cop watching this at home would have drawn his gun and shot his computer in self defense 




 yeah and it actually looked like he threw himself on purpose 




 *tips cap* 




 It looks like your dog has a huge heart shape on its back. Pretty cool.

 Mega feminists these days 




 the guy behind the dinosaur looks like he's about to get shat on 




 when you see it...you'll shit bricks
 




 His tires are too big 




 Do you want the stick? 




 this happens when you hear your SO is home alone.. 




 Its from the brand Dejablue, but it is still a six pack even though its canned water 




 That guy in the back is very casually grabbing his balls 




 No no he's trying to seduce you, didn't you see that wink and sly smile? 




 Step 2: Sell sponges

Step 3: Profit 




 It looks like Peter is grinning at the error message 




 your grandfather was Mr. Rodgers? 




 At least they weren't jacking off like the rest of the people there 




 Yeah you actually saved the cats from him 




 I tell this to people who call me fat.

 Is your windshield broken, of is it the camera lens that's broken? 




 The NSA probably sponsored theses bathrooms stalls to fight terrorism. "*its to protect the public*" they say.

 the 25 cents you give the homeless man are adding up... 




 It would be so funny if he uses the force and actually ties his shoes 









 He's a statue street performer not a mime.

 They look like some girls coming back from the night club... 




 Get laid 




 I'm glad Norm has not stopped working and makes wheelbarrows and clocks for people. I've noticed people that retire wish they could go back again. I myself have a Grandpa who will turn 94, and he still hasn't stopped working. He says his body would slow down, and that he gets sick if he doesn't work. Keep busy Norm!
And Haappy Birthday!

 I didn't get it either but then I thought "oh its because they pronounce L sounds are R sounds." So instead of saying "pilots" they say "pirates". My thought ^__^
