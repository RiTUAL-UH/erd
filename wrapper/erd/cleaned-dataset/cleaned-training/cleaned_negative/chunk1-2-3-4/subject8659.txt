 This is true. Unfortunately there aren't any real engineering firms in my area and I definitely don't want to work here. I was going to interview one of my civ professors who used to be a practicing engineer, but thought a current engineer would give more prevalent answers. 




 Haha, thanks for the reply! It's really appreciated. 




 On a side note, do you like what you do, what DO you do, and any advise for a student about to enter the professional world? I do not plan on getting my masters immediately after my undergrad. Thanks! 




 Thanks for the quick reply! I'm a civil engineering student taking a professional writing course, and we needed to get someone in our related field to answer to above questions. If you wouldn't mind, I'd really appreciate it. Unfortunately, I'm a broke college student and cant pay the $110/hr fee :-P 




 These are more or less the questions I need answered. Thanks a bunch!!

 how they function day-to-day as writers
 how often they write and what their process is
 what sorts of documentation they produce
 what sorts of problems and conflicts they face in writing situations
 what role technology plays in their professional communications
 in what ways and how often they collaborate
 what sorts of legal and ethical concerns characterize the climate in which they write
 what other sorts of communication issues arise in their environment
 writing advice they have for a young person entering the field.
 




 Try I-Doser clips. They are binaural soundtracks that are meant to simulate the brain waves you have when your one drugs. They never work obviously, but they make me pass out... its kinda like weird white noise. 
Tip: Only works with headphones. 




 I too need an apartment near SU 




 Cozumel grill downtown... its kind of a trendy bar, but the foods amazing. Also, Gramma Moras is pretty good, but personally, I would recommend Mighty Taco, its kinda like Taco Bell but WAY better. 




 WOW
 




 THIS seems like a good idea :) 




 ohhh... okay then :)

 2 roommates and myself got 28 jr. bacon cheeseburgers from wendys, 4 medium fries, and 3 large sodas... we killed a 12 pack while consuming these... one of the roommates would regularly kill 5-6 burgers/chicken sandwiches in one sitting... I would like to add none of us are by any means fat and go to the gym regularly 




 Amazing, I just spent 34 hours in sea-tac and JUST got home... I too went for the beers :) Only an extra dollar to make it a 20 oz, why not?!

 Structurally speaking, almost anything that is carbonated is stored in a cylinder because of the internal pressures. A rectangular prism shaped bottle would need to be substantially thicker to withstand the internal pressures creates by carbonation and outside temperature and barometric pressure changes. 




 While in high school, I was a teachers aid for an 8th grade summer school program at the local middle school. There was some activity that involved the students labeling the oceans and continents on a black and white Mercator map. As if by high school I hadn't figured out where they were yet, the 20-something teacher I was aiding for kindly made me a key by labeling a map for me. To my initial shock, and eventual amusement, she labeled every single thing incorrectly. North America was the Indian Ocean, Asia was the Pacific, South America was Africa, etc.
I immediately gave this to my mother who was a teacher in the district. The teacher was not fired, but I was told given an atlas....   
























 will do! 









 I read somewhere a while back that it was Michael Jordan who accidentally started the look. After he went pro, he continued to wear his "lucky" college shorts underneath his NBA uniform, making his NBA shorts ride a little lower. People tried to copy the cool lower-riding shorts...fast forward... ankle pants! 




 There is, they have to sign it for us to work on it, and those never hold up in court... :/ 




 If she was a former employee, she knows how easy it is to get money from big retail corporations. Best Buy normally tries to settle things like this out of court... I would assume since it IS going to court that Best Buy has substantial doubt. 




 When someone actually PAYS you to do the service though, you run the risk of them perpetually saying the problem was never fixed and you become almost indebted to them. Fix it quick and free and there is no further obligation to assist them and if they are being annoying about it, you can politely decline since money isnt on the table. 




 As a former employee, they go over all of this like CRAZY. Data privacy is Geek Squads #1 priority. 
I'll preface that I could care less whether Best Buy loses money getting sued. BUT, everyone has an anti-corporation mentality, so 95% of the time that people take Best Buy to small claims, they win since everyone assumes that they MUST have been screwed over because it was a corporation. 

Some examples include: Guy left his laptop to get fixed, takes a few days and he never comes to pick it up. In our system, we had over 20 logged calls to both his numbers, and 2 letters that he had to sign for saying we were going to recycling his computer if he didnt pick it up. He even signed paperwork saying he would pick it up within 30 days of us calling him, and store policy is keeping it for 120. We recycled it after 8 months, and he came in 3 months later looking to pick it up. Apparently the settlement was twice the ORIGINAL value of a 4 year old laptop.
Guy brings in a TV that Best Buy had never sold and it has a hole in the screen. He said he purchased an extended warranty (doesn't cover damage like that anyways) but no one could find a receipt of it, obviously. Same thing, settled for an amount WAY higher than its worth.

Also, the services may seem expensive to someone who knows what they're doing, but to older people that have no other method of learning or getting things fixed, it was a useful service that many people told me that they were grateful we even OFFERED them.

TL;DR: Yes, people take HUGE advantage of corporations. In my experience, if you legitimately got screwed over, the managers would bend over backwards to help since they knew if legal action is ever taken, they lose.

 I 100% agree, the price gouging is ridiculous and no one needs $200 HDMI cables. I'm also not saying that unscrupulous salesmen are around... BUT the extra $$ on items is essentially the cost of having a sales staff at your disposal that can answer questions and give you face to face customer service... something that makes no difference for ME, but for many people, especially older generations, face to face interactions are a requirement, they simply don't want to or dont trust other methods.

Everyone uses the HDMI example when refering to price gouging as it is probably one of the worst products this happens with (and as someone that has a better than average perception of A/V theory, expensive HDMI is bogus). Otherwise, the prices aren't really that outrageous. Compare prices with newegg sometime, they're almost always the same.

Before I worked retail, I would have argued all the same points as I too thought it was ridiculous, but once you realize how desperate a lot of people are, you realize the services offered, albeit expensive, are a huge resource for many people. I have tons of stories of me telling people cheaper/better options, but they want to spend the money for a large variety of reasons.  I've heard countless tales of people coming from Mom and Pop stores with horror stories, just like any huge retailer. I've also seen ridiculous customer service, e.i. people dropped their brand new TV and got a new $2000 TV, something that would be difficult to do online or at a mom and pops shop. 

I personally agree with a lot of what your saying, but there's a whole other perspective you probably haven't seen or experienced that changes a lot of things 




 Yes, this is true, but you clearly know how to use the internet. The majority of people out there are clueless when it comes to new technology and need to go into a store to actually be able to talk to someone about what they need. That extra service (and the convenience of having it right there) will cost you extra sometimes. 

Also,Best Buy price matches Amazon, Newegg, tigerdirect, etc... and a lot of other big box stores do similar price matching 




 For those not familiar with Windows 8, there is a "Live tile" for your photos, that automatically scrolls through anything in your pictures library. Well... some guy came in for us to take a look at his new 27" All-in-one PC. I set it up and begin on the paperwork. When I turn around to look at the computer, which was facing the customer, the Live tile was scrolling through pictures of the man getting a blowjob from some white woman. The bad part was that the woman he came in with was black. The next few minutes while I was finishing up the paperwork were very cringe-worthy as I didn't my counter to erupt into a Maury episode if the woman were to glance over, luckily she didnt. 




 A nice family came in to purchase a new computer (iMac) and wanted all their data transfer from their old PC to the new one. I ended up dealing with the family substantially more than than a normal customer because the first Mac had some issues out of the box and we had to swap it. Anyways... Data is transferred, everything is good. Mom, dad, son and daughter are all super excited to get the new computer home. 

About an hour and a half later, I get a scathing phone call from the previously friendly mother accusing me of putting porn on their new computer. I try to explain to her that there is no reason I would do that (It would take time, they were nice customers, i could get fired?!) and tell her to come in so we can investigate. 

As it turns out, when they opened up their photo viewer for the first time, it populated ALL photos on the computer... including all the uncleared temp files which included some heavy fetish porn and gore. The priceless part was explaining this to the furious mother as both her son and husband were bright red standing right next to her.

 I had a lady bring in her keyboard and insisted I take the viruses off of it. After trying to explain that virus's can only infect the "box" everything connects to, she asked me to remove the virus's from her computer...at home... with the keyboard I had in store. When I told her that would be impossible and the would have to bring the computer in, she insinuated that I was incompetent at my job... :/

 I currently live in Skagway and work as a tour guide if anyone has questions! 




 No, no! I've toured all over the lower 48 and I'm currently working a seasonal bike touring job in AK. My contract ends in September and I'm looking for another seasonal position outside the U.S.  Alaska is great!!  




 I'm trying to find a seasonal position somewhere preferably outside the U.S.  I've been leading cycling tours all around the U.S. for the past few summers and currently, I'm a cycling guide in Alaska. I'm an engineering student trying to get some worldly experience before I jump into the "real world". Thanks!!

Edit: I'm not necesarily looking for a cycling job and have a lot of  outdoor experience, as well as many years experience in food service and bartending. 




 Haha, I love that game! Never noticed this before! 




 Same, I'm a student with no kids and I would love to help out. I can afford up to $60 from amazon or any other reputable website. Nothing beats happy kids :)

 Idk... Nokia is playing the comeback game, they have more incentive to be innovative. Apple hasn't done anything new that's useful in years and the GS3/4/5 are essentially the same. Slightly bigger screens and faster GPU/CPU/SoC, but nothing really innovative.

Nokia is experimenting with crazy cameras and other emerging technologies. You can buy "charging covers" for a few other Nokia models as well to give them wireless charging functionality. 

One cool thing Samsung did on the ATIV SE is put an IR blaster in it so you can use it as a universal remote. I would love to see that in more products!


EDIT: To answer your "big fat coil" question, other than my knowledge of induction, I have no idea how they implement it in the phone. The Nokia Icon/930 is 9.8mm as its thickest, so it's by no means huge.
 




 There are some cords (I own a Logitech one) where the two side are asymmetrical. The top half has a big bump thats really easy to grab. I use it in my car so I can plug my phone in while driving without having to look... not the best idea, I know. I'm trying to find a link...

But seriously... Using locks must infuriate you. Up, down, left, right... WHICH WAY IS IT?! 




 the Nokia 930/ Nokia Icon has wireless charging built in. You can either set it on a stand or plate (those do need to be plugged in) and it charges almost as efficiently as if it were plugged in.

I routed out the bottom of my night stand, left about 1/16" of material, and glued the plate in. Now, I just set my phone in the corner of the night stand and it charges!

 Thank you. I laughed way harder than I should have. 




 The article clearly states that the school administration made him delete it. Also, almost half the posts before you reference this. 




 This has already happened to some extent with [John Joe Gray](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Joe_Gray) in Texas. 
During a traffic stop in 1999, he attacked a state trooper and was found to have terrorist literature in his vehicle. 

According to all the news articles, he's basically been holed up on his 50-acre property ever since, and law enforcement don't want to risk entering his property to arrest him citing fears of violent retaliation from not only him and his family, but nearby anti-government extremist e.g Timothy McVeigh and the Waco Seige

The only obvious difference is that Gray kind of imprisoned himself on his land whereas Bundy is still "free" 




 You need an Office 365 subscription which is $99/year. However, that gives you 5 PC/Mac and 5 mobile device licenses...

SO, with one subscription, you can get FULL office professional (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Access, Publisher, OneNote, and more) which is normally $400/license on 5 computers, plus 5 phones/tablets (iOS, android, Windows Phone) running mobile Office. Additionally, you also get an extra 20GB of Onedrive storage 




 Serious question, have you ever used a Surface or Windows 8 phone? 




 I still dont understand what the older Start Menu gave you in terms of functionality that windows 8.1 doesn't. Additionally, its seems even EASIER to get to certain things.

 1. Go to programs and features in control panel, sort by date installed, and remove anything suspicious. Many times its listed as Conduit.

2. Open your browsers, and go to you addons/extensions and remove them. Next, change your default search provider to Google or Bing and remove the bad ones. Lastly, change your homepage to something reputable.

3. Download and run Malwarebytes (quick scan) and ADW Cleaner. 

4. Install Adblock Plus on all browsers.

This is very abbreviated and can depend on what OS, browsers, and severity of infection. Feel free to PM me, I would be happy to give more detailed advice! 




 -Run ADW Cleaner and Malwarebytes (quick scan) monthly or as needed

-Remove startup items. Run MSCONFIG and uncheck any items that aren't vital to the computers operation. Generally leave any hardware, OS, or antivirus items and remove everything else. Googling specific items can help determine what should be kept.

-Periodically check your installed programs, and remove unnecessary items. Again, googling things can help identify good, bad, and necessary. I like to sort mine by date installed as it makes it easy to identify what was done recently.

-Update windows, Java, and Adobe flash and reader from reliable sources.

 No problem! Hope they love it! 




 To help mine, I put it in the corner of the cage and then fed them treats through the bars behind it. This forced them to climb on it and if you position the treats just right, they will start running! I did this for a few days and a week later they were using it on their own accord  




 There are many ultrabooks with 3200x1800 resolution out currently, some with discrete graphics. This is nothing special. 




 Pros: Properly owning and caring for a pet can be very rewarding 

Chins can live a very long time (15-20 years) 

Cons: Chins can live very long. They probably can't take the chin to college, so who will look after it?

They have stringent needs. Specific food, temperatures, housing needs, etc. Kids can't give them tons of treats.

Although adorable, their cuddly level varies from chin to chin and even the cuddly ones work on their own schedule. Don't expect this to be a pet you can just cuddle with whenever.

If they get out, they are difficult to catch... think squirrel.
 




 Yep.

 Mr old roommate use to weld occasionally. If you look at your weld WHILE your welding (without a mask/proper eye protection) it can cause serious eye damage. Think staring at the Sun. 

He would get around this by setting up the weld, close eyes, weld, and repeat. Worked pretty well! 




 Oh! Did you purchase a windows 8 key?? If you have the key, you just re-install windows and use the key again. There no limit to how many installs you have with the key, just one device can be activated with it at one time. 




 If the drives are within manufacturers warranty (normally a year), they will probably replace them for you. Technically, overvolting isnt covered, but its very hard to determine... might as well try!
  




 I'll assume this is an OEM computer that you're dropping a new motherboard into. 

- Make a set of backup disks from the manufacturer utility or type "Create a recovery drive" on the start screen to make a system image. (Having an escape plan is important!)

- Get a bootable Windows 8 .ISO on a disk or USB http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/upgrade-product-key-only

- Download Belarc Advisor. http://www.belarc.com/free_download.html This is an awesome utility that will tell you everything about your computer, including all your software license key about halfway down the page.

- Install the new motherboard and attempt to load windows 8! Worst case scenario, revert back to the original motherboard and reinstall using your recovery disks. 




 If you're looking for a faster route (not really better than sandpaper though), You can get a cheap (~$10) rotary tool at Harbor freight. Put a buffing/polishing wheel on it and your good to go. 




 That is quite an impressive jig... just... WOW. 




 hit up craigslist or harbor freight and all those tools including the vise will be less than $200... 




 Thank you for that. :) 




 The steel he purchased was already "folded", so it was, just not by him. 









 xpost from /r/ ASMR... 





























 IT depends on what operating system you're using. If its Windows 8/8.1, you can initial a full Reset from within the OS. 

If its Windows 7, the recovery console SOMETIMES appears on another monitor after reboot (as it is loading the default drivers). but this depends on the manufacturer as well as the hardware. 

Good luck! Let us know how that goes or if anything needs clarification.

Alternatively, laptop screens are surprisingly easy to replace, especially on most HP laptops.  




 Canned air is generally more effective at dislodging dust in the nooks and crannies. That being said, I have never heard of anyone causing ESD damage, but I have seen people physically drag a vacuum attachment across sensitive components and damage them.

Basically, you're fine with the vacuum, just don't whack stuff with it :P 




 I agree. Any theoretical performance increase is completely negligible. The only difference (this is purely based on my observations) is that 3.5" drives fail slightly less due to the data density not being as high. I manage many computers, both desktops and laptops, and the smaller drives seem to physically fail as well as get corruptions much more frequently that the larger drives of same capacity. Like I said, I have nothing to back that statement up other than anecdotal observations. 




 If you can get into Windows still, go here: 

C:/  Users  "UserName"  AppData

AppData is hidden, so unhide your folders if you cant find it. Now you should see three folders: Local, LocalLow, and Roaming. In each folder, there are lots of other folders and then random files. Delete all these random files that aren't in folders. A lot of them are benign, but this is the most common place for virus' to hide. 

Good luck! Let us know how it goes or if that doesn't work. 




 As others have said, you were probably touching the heatsink which should be substantially cooler than the CPU.

I would apply some thermal paste. Most thermal paste is only rated to last a few years and given that you're running a 6 year old C2D, it's probably all dried up now. RadioShack and Best Buy carry it for $10 or less and its fairly easy to apply. There are several youtube video's explaining techniques and how-to's, but q-tips and alcohol are super useful when cleaning the old paste off the CPU and the heatsink.

Additionally, you may have bumped the heatsink while messing around in the case. I did this several years ago where I SLIGHTLY popped one of the 4 heatsink lock pins and the CPU was overheating within minutes. In this scenario, I would still re-apply the thermal paste and re-attach the heatsink. (If you remove the heatsink, you kind of have to re-apply thermal paste, especially if its old and dried)

Good luck!  




 Basically... you can't :(

There are some crazy work around and occasional success stories, but its a huge pain. For $10 more you can get one on Amazon (or get a 320GB for $45)

http://www.amazon.com/120GB-Hard-Disk-Drive-Generic/dp/B004GIGA1A/ref=sr_1_13?ie=UTF8 qid=1406606362 sr=8-13 keywords=xbox+hard+drive

 




 If you're using Windows 8/8.1, File History is an awesome feature that backs up your entire Library every hour and is super easy to use. 




 What was your reason for not using the recovery partition on your laptop? 

Depending on how you formatted/partitioned, you may be able to still use the factory recovery image. If you are trying to go from 8/8.1 to 8.1 Pro, you can type in "add features" on the Start screen and then follow the prompts to enter your 8.1 Pro key. It will upgrade without requiring a full re-install.

What brand is your laptop? Most laptop brands have different tricks to get into their recovery console. 




 In an offline scenario such as a boot disk, the command would be 

sfc /scannow /offbootdir=d:\  /offwindir=d:\windows

Where d: is where Windows is installed. 

 




 I'd say 15-60 minutes,  but however long it would normally be before your computer crashes when playing games would be a more accurate time. 




 Additionally, you could purchase a simple stand-alone mic. They are cheap and often perform better that headset mics (I have the A40's and prefer a $10 desktop mic) 




 As others have stated, it sounds like a hardware, not software issue (but it still could be!) The two most likely cases are the card is bad or the card is overheating. There is also the possibility that your power supply isn't giving the card enough power or it could be a memory issue. Lets troubleshoot to try to narrow it down, shall we?

Possible Issues:

-Overheating

-Bad/Defective card

-Graphics driver issue

-Power Supply issue

~~-Memory Issue~~


1. How old is the card? It is important to note whether or not it is still under warranty. I'm going to assume it is, so we don't want to void the warranty :P

2. Pop the case open and see if the fan/heatsink area on the card is dusty. Clogged heatsink = overheating. Canned air is generally much safer than a vacuum cleaner if youi have to remove any dust.

3. If there is no dust, or you cleaned it, let's run a test to see if the card is overheating. There are several ways to go about this. I like [Furmark](http://www.geeks3d.com/20140313/furmark-1-13-0-download-gpu-burn-in-stress-test-opengl/) as it is quick, simple, and shows the temp during the test so there's no need for extra monitoring programs. Most CPU/GPU's are relatively safe up to ~100*C, but realistically going above 80*C means there's an issue. Your card in particular should be around 65*C at full throttle. Run the programs "Burn-in Test" and monitor its temps. Run the program for as long as it normally takes to crash while playing games.

4. If your card is staying nice and cool or doesn't crash during testing, that means your card itself is probably fine. Next, lets update your drivers. [This](http://support.amd.com/en-us/download/desktop?os=Windows%207%20-%2064#amd-catalyst-packages) download should get you the most up-to-date driver directly from AMD. This is a much newer driver than is listed on your cards page, so that could be the issue. Once you have the new driver loaded, restart your computer (even if it doesn't tell you to) and start playing your games!! If the issue goes away... awesome! If not, lets keep troubleshooting.

5. We will assume its not a memory issue since you ran Memtest already, and power supplies are difficult to test without a multimeter or power supply tester. This next step is kinda skeevy, but works. If you have a Best Buy, Walmart, or any other store that sells graphics cards, buy one that is preferably in the same series (R9 2XX) and play on it to see if the same thing happens. (These big box stores will let you return opened cards within their return policy.) If you do get a card in the same series as your R9 280X, it is using the same driver, so is purely testing whether your card is bad or not. 

If these don't work, post your results and we'll go from there. Good luck! 




 Try this on the Mini DisplayPort 

http://www.monoprice.com/Product?seq=1 format=2 p_id=8118 CAWELAID=1329456194 CAGPSPN=pla gclid=Cj0KEQjwrqieBRCln82Rgufz7I0BEiQAPNjAI8Ps5kvbe-WlFBG0K4t8vrLgS9i8fLyahnmuz2FnpLwaAqN78P8HAQ

That would give you your S7 screen and two monitors. The Toshiba DynaDock can also do this. 




 A couple things to try...

First, see if there's a voltage corrector. Its a little switch that you can select 120v VS 220v. If its on the 220v, but you're using a 120v socket, you'll have some issues.

Secondly, you might be short a cable! You mentioned that you plugged in the 24-pin cable and the 4-pin CPU cable. On some pictures, it looked like your motherboard might actually take an 8-pin CPU cable. Check and see if there's just one square 4-pin socked on the motherboard or if it's a rectangular 8-pin socket. If this is the case, you'll need a completely different model of PSU and it might be cheaper to get it directly from Dell as most PSU's with 8-pin CPU cables are on the higher end and more expensive. 

Good luck and let us know! 




 I agree, this sounds very much like a driver issue. It could be the driver is just corrupt or needs some TLC, or it could be that LoL and the driver aren't playing nice.

 I would uninstall and delete the driver from Device Manager as well as any Catalyst software and completely re-download the driver. If that doesn't work, try doing the same procedure with older drivers.

Good luck! Let us know how it goes! 




 I would update/re-install your**[ drivers](http://www.nvidia.com/download/driverResults.aspx/75991/en-us)** if you haven't yet. If that doesn't help it could be a hardware issue. 

If its hardware, it could be your card overheating or just going bad ,your power supply overheating or going bad, or even possibly RAM. 

First, I would heavily dust out your case, especially around the PSU, card heatsink, and CPU heatsink. You can download a monitoring program (I like **[Speccy](https://www.piriform.com/speccy/download/standard)**, but there are several) and a stress test (I like **[FurMark](http://www.ozone3d.net/benchmarks/fur/)**, but again, any is good.) and see how hot everything gets; your card is listed as 105c max operating temp, but ideally they would be around 95ish while stressing. You could also attempt to re-apply the thermal paste if it does seem that heat is an issue.

To test RAM, **[Memtest86](http://www.memtest86.com/download.htm)** works fairly well. I would start it before bed and see how its doing in the morning as it can take a while or run indefinitely. 

Your PSU can be tricky to test unless you have a multimeter or ideally a power supply tester. If your video card isnt receiving enough power when it needs it, bad stuff happens. 

Let us know if that helps of not! 




 It should work, but depends on a few things such as where you got the trial from. Some variables such as volume license keys, Upgrade vs Full keys, etc could cause compatibility issues. Worst case scenario, you'd have to re-install Windows .exe they provided. 
If you do run into an issue with it upgrade/full, let me know because there is a registry tweak to get around that. 

Good luck! 




 It seems like your computer might still think that your headphones are plugged in, or something similar. Assuming you're using a newer Win7/8/8.1 PC, try right-clicking the volume or speaker icon next to the clock and select "Playback Options". In the windows that appears, it should show you all the different device possible (On mine for example, I have HDMI, Astro Headset, Digital Output, and Digital Optical Output). In your situation, you would want to select "Speakers" and then click "Set Default" below. 

If that works, there's a good chance that your 3.5mm port is damaged, but you can always use the above steps to manually change it. Hope that helps! 




 If I recall, "doubleclick.net" is what Google uses for ad tracking. Basically, if you've every Googled something, you'll have that cookie on there. Like others have said, its harmless. 

Since it looks like you're using Chrome, you can try turning off the "tracking" setting by going to the Settings Menu (3 horizontal lines in the upper-right)  Settings  "Show Advanced Settings"  and under the Privacy section, tick the box "Send a "Do Not Track" request with your browsing traffic"

Hope that helps! 




 There is rarely a single program that is universally good at protecting you, but if a nice "toolset" is assembled, it can greatly help. All of the listed programs are free!!

**[MSE or Microsoft Security Essentials:](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5201)** This is your base level protection that hopefully catches the really bad stuff. It get shit on a lot, but it seemingly offers great protection against some pretty nasty infections. It automatically updates with Windows and almost never bothers you gives pop-ups unless if finds something. *Note* : Don't install multiple, always-on, anti-virus programs and uninstall any old ones you don't use (Kaspersky, Norton, McAfee, etc). They can "fight" with each other stop working properly.

**[Malwarebytes](https://www.malwarebytes.org/mwb-download/):** This is a scanner that you have to run. Unlike MSE, it does not offer constant scanning (in the free version), but does a great job of removing both really nasty stuff as well as annoying toolbars and adware. Pro Tip: Right-click the check-boxes on the reports page, and click "Select All". Much easier than clicking every box!


**[ADWCleaner:](https://toolslib.net/downloads/finish/1/)** This is an easy to use and quick scanner that only targets adware, toolbars, browser hacks, etc. The app is portable (doesn't have to be installed) and is updated daily.

**[AdBlock Plus:](https://adblockplus.org/en/chrome)** This is an awesome little browser add-on that is an incredible pop-up blocker as well as helps get rid of banners and ads on websites. You'll have to install it on each browser you use separately; the link will auto-detect what browser you are using.

**[CCleaner](http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner/download/standard)**: Nice tool that cleans temp files (and can do a ton of other stuff if you're feeling bold). Doesn't really remove or scan for virus's, but malware very frequently hids in temp file locations.

All that being said, if you really like subscription anti-virus (Kaspersky, McAfee, etc.) you can normally get them for**[ FREE!](http://dealnews.com/search.html?search=anti-virus)** 




 It's hard to tell exactly what needs adhering from the pictures, but have you tried double sided tape? There are industrial adhesive mounting tape and automotive tape that is incredible strong. Additionally, you could always try epoxy, but you wont ever get it off again.

Good luck! 




 Saw them last night. They were good and chilled in the crowd for the rest of the acts. 

Whoever was manning the audio board however was a total idiot. WAY too loud, woofers were distorting, and you could barely appreciate the music. I get that certain genres beg to be blasted, but this is not one of them.

Its not FLAC, but its not bad 




 My 2008 Ford Focus SES with ~90k started having trouble shifting around 30-40 mph (although I'm not sure exactly what gear 3rd or 4th would be my guess.)  From a stop, the car accelerates without issue, but maybe 30% of the time when I get to 30-40 mph, the engine revs up to about 5k RPM. I take my foot off the gas and gently push the gas again and it will normally get into gear after 1-3 attempts at "pumping" the gas. I have researched this and found "Some 2008 Focus vehicles equipped with 4F27E automatic transaxle and built on or before 1/29/2008 may experience no 3rd or 4th gear. Possible diagnostic troubles codes (DTCs) P0733 and/or P0734. The cause may be a direct clutch snap ring out of position caused by the reverse clutch wave spring." It seemed like this was only happening on almost new cars and im not getting any CEL, so I'm not sure if this would apply to my situation.

As for the vehicles history, I've owned the car for about 2 years and put about 25k on it. I have not done any transmission maintenance (I'm not even sure if that's a thing!) but I've gotten the oil changed 3 times and hit a deer a month ago ( the issue was there before though). At around 75k miles, I had terrible engine shake while idling, and the dealership replaced the engine mount. 

As far as troubleshooting and repairing myself, I'm very mechanically inclined and have no problem diving into stuff, but I have never gotten into cars, so my knowledge is very basic.

Any help, insight, or advice would be very appreciated... thank you!! 




 Ad**d**ress. 




 If you have Office 365, then yes. If you purchased Office for Mac then no.

As it has already been said, Office and Office for Mac have two separate licensing keys, hence they cannot be swapped between them. Office 365 on the other hand can be installed on PC, Mac, Android, iOS, and Windows Phone.

If you DO have Office 365, or are unsure, go to www.office.com and login (upper right corner) using your Microsoft Account (you need a Microsoft account to have O365 so if you never made one, you probably don't have it). Once logged in, click on My Account in the upper right and the page will populate all Office products associated with that account with a large green "Install" button.

If you're still unsure, what version of Office are you running? Office 365 will only be Office 2013 so if you have '03,'07,'10 then your copy is not transferable. 

Depending on how often you use Office and in what capacity, you can try using the webapps on www.Office.com. You get Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote for free and unless you're using higher level functions (macros, etc) the webapps are basically identical to the full program.

Hope that helps! 




 Those look great! I'm really curious as to what the red material you used it called and where you can find it. Also, a metal handsaw is generally known as a "hacksaw" in English. 




 If sold as a built computer, how much should I expect? Thanks!

 "The tank is back from the days when i was breeding... its a baby milk bottle tank"
Is he talking about himself?! HAHAHAHA 









 Not shatter, but I have literally done exactly as OP described and had "shards" or think wafers of metal come off. 




 How does this this happen? Is it a special breed or something? I'm curious to see how big the second largest rabbit is...
