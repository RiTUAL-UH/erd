*Terraria ( I always mess up the name!) 
























 Well while I was searching through YouTube I found a video of Robert Downey Jr's song "Man like me" and right away I tought: yup I have to learn how to play that song
So I went to google and searched the chords and in ultimate guitar the song was missing some text so I was wondering if you guys could help me with the song? Just standart tuning guitar tabs here are the lyrics:

 My point was that there are some SOME :D important questions there and noone give a f**k about those people
