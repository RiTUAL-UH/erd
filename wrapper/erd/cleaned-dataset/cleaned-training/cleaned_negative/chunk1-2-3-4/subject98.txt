 Living in Olympia WA geology is in your face and after reading McPhee I've got the bug. I am working through *Earth* 10th ed by Tarbuck *et al*, several books by David Alt *et al*.

Is there a geology equivalent to *Sky and Telescope*? The stuff I see is more oriented to rock hounds. Blogs or forums for amateurs? When I get some time I'd like to ramble around the scablands; any recommended spots? Thx!

 From Wikipedia:

By 5 August the brigades of the Australian 2nd Division were exhausted and were to be relieved by the Australian 4th Division. While the relief was underway on the night of 56 August the Australians were subjected to an extreme bombardment, because the salient they occupied could be shelled by the Germans from all directions, including from Thiepval which lay to the rear. On the morning of 6 August a German counter-attack tried to approach the O.G. Lines but was met by machine gun fire and forced to dig in. The bombardment continued through the day, by the end of which most of the 2nd Division had been relieved. From its twelve days in the line, the division had suffered 6,848 casualties. At 4:00 a.m. on 7 August, shortly before dawn, the Germans launched their final counter-attack. On a front of 400 yards (370 m) they overran the thinly occupied O.G. Lines, catching most of the Australians in shelters in the old German dugouts and advanced towards Pozires. For the Australians, the crisis had arrived. At this moment, Lieutenant Albert Jacka, who had won the Victoria Cross at Gallipoli, emerged from a dugout where he and seven men of his platoon had been isolated, and charged the German line from the rear. His example inspired other Australians scattered across the plateau to join the action and a fierce, hand-to-hand fight developed. Jacka was badly wounded but as support arrived from the flanks, the Australians gained the advantage and most of the surviving Germans were captured. No more attempts to retake Pozires were made.

 Dad would never talk about the war. All he would ever say was "I did my duty". My Uncle told me about D-day. After my Dad died I found an Air Medal (with three Oak Leaves), but I have never been able to find out what he did. He never flew after the war, but worked for Lockheed for the rest of working life. Again, he was close-mouthed about work, but he was usually at a Lockheed facility in Palmdale.

There were boxes of photos from the war in the attic. Quite a few pics of paratroops loading up, long lines of C-47s.

He met my Mom in Orleans in 1944. Buts her's is another story. 




 It nauseates me to look at this.

 The plaque affixed to the instrument panel reads:

In accomplishing her 100 missions Corsair 122 logged more than 400 hours flying time; her total hops, including tests and reconnaissance flights, reached an amazing 178. Built for air combat, Corsair 122 proved her versatility by accepting 1000 pound bombs slung from her belly and without strain or protest developed into the hottest dive bomber with wings. Were their blood in her fuel line instead of 100 octane she would be wearing the purple heart for the patch on the leading edge of her wing attesting of the accuracy of Jap antiaircraft fire. She has covered all the Jap bases in the Marshall Islands like the morning dew.

 Pyroclastic flows descend the south-eastern flank of Mayon Volcano, Philippines. Maximum height of the eruption column was 15 km above sea level, and volcanic ash fell within about 50 km toward the west. There were no casualties from the 1984 eruption because more than 73,000 people evacuated the danger zones as recommended by scientists of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology.

 "Over the years I have seen *Ikiru* every five years or so, and each time it has moved me, and made me think"

 *Repulsion*, Roman Polanski, 1965.  




 *Hell's Angels*, Howard Hughes, 1930. Even today the air combat scenes are among the most believable (alas 3 pilots and a mechanic were killed during the production). The explosions are real, unlike the flash and noise spectacles since. And Jean Harlow uses the line "wait here while I slip into something more comfortable" (she's wearing very little to begin with) for the first time. Because it's pre Hayes the dialog gets a bit spicey.

These motorcycles were popular for their high performance. Besides being hand built, with many optional performance modifications available, they came from the factory with documented dynamometer test results, allowing the new owner to see the horsepower produced."
