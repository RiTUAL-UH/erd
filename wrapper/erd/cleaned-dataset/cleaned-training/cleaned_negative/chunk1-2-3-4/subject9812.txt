 Not lame. I laughed.  




 Everybody dance!! 
























 My wife and I love that so, here, have an upvote.  




 What motivated you to write the song Hesitate? Where were you at the time, psychologically speaking? 

 
























 Not hot to the touch. Not a bug bite, its actually been there for a while. Maybe even years. Doesn't seem to be causing any other problems.  





























 I thank you all for the words of encouragement and insight. Splitting the for test from the MIC helped a lot. Now I am back on track. 




 Last night I attempted to start Month 2 Day 1. I got through the fit test just fine. However, I found that I could not complete the Max Interval Circuit. I got about halfway through and physically could not do it. Maybe I'm being too hard on myself but that was a real blow to my confidence in terms of this workout.

I really enjoy this workout. I love the potential results I could get.

To anyone else here, how did you stay motivated to keep going when it got tough and when you felt like you couldn't do it anymore?
