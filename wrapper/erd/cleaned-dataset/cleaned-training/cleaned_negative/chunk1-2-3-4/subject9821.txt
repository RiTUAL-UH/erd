 I ask that because a verb is defined as an action or a state of being....... 




 Use it in a sentence where it yeilds it in form to be an action.





Morals evolving renders them meaningless? Religion has changed does it render that meaningless? 




 Not a religous belief 




 No it is not a religous belief  religous attitude or  religous practice. Again where are you getting your conclusion from? 




 Maybe this post is not for you since you cease to make an assumption. 




 Where does it say religion is the representation of moral development?? 




 Im not looking for years of teaching as religion is interpretive. Im simply asking how you interpret it and how adam and eve fit in. 




 Thats contradictory, if the bible is not a moral guide book as you say. 




 Worship is giving worth to something, in verb or noun form. Giving or practicing giving worth to something is not an action.



In verb form, the mayans built a temple to worship the gods. There is no action in worship of the gods, building the temple is an action.




Morals evolve as society and human intelligence does. 




 Ohh, didnt know that, thats pretty cool 




 Does he direct that? 




 didnt adam and eve get banished from eden? How does this happen if evolution took place on earth not eden? Im just asking how this fits together and how its woven into your beliefs? 




 Yes. In an evolved society with evolved humans and an evolved moral system killing others for pleasure isnt the path to least resistance,ie the path to least suffering.




Isnt what you are referring to exactly what happens in religous text? 




 If you are arguing morals come from religion, the question is extremely relevant. 




 So then morals do not come from religion, if they come from God. 




 Not the second one but you did edit the 1st one after i commented 




 Where? Link? 




 Huh? I dont understand that last post 




 How? If we evolved on earth though? 




 Did you read my post? Morality evolves, ie the choices being right or wrong, as human intelligence and society evolve.



Again, worship is not an action so.... 




 He is about as well played, and epic a villian can get. 




 I didnt see anything in your link about them 




 It might work for you but the question is based on your choice, if you cant make one, thats perfectly fine, but again the topic at hand is not for you.




The point is i have questions as to which you pick to help me understand, a non choice doesnt help me. 




 Good, bad, main, supporting, etc. He has some of the most memeroable movies in film history, out of his films who was your favorite creation? and why?




I have to say Bill the butcher is my fav 




 Np, fair enough. But where does adam and eve come into play? 




 It matters in the sense of are we talking about primitive or evolved morality? Are we talking about killing for pleasure or self defense? If you have followed my defining terms all this matters 




 Np 




 That is not an action that is a product of belief, no action involved. 




 Let me rephase, i think you should read the description before you comment, as the question has to do with either or, not neither. 




 How did the fall happen if we evolved on earth? 




 Really, you make no sense. But i will look for answers elsewhere 




 You didnt answer it in regard to an evolution or creationist view



God creates in both which do you believe 




 Religous attidudes is an attitude of a belief in God and or worship. Thats a standard defintion 




 Where does your definition come from? You just made it up? Then yes it is a problem to define things personally and expect the rest of the world to change their definition 




 The bible does say where sin came into play, hinting at its existence in the garden of eden. But i assume from your comments you dont take it literally.




Just curious, do you ever lend thought to where sin started, or is it a non issue for you? 




 Im not implyin you do or i know everything, but depending on your interpretation of evolution or creationism how does adam and eve fit your beliefs? 




 You see how this, your pov, is a bit confusing? 




 You believe in creationism as in the world is 6000 years old, or evolutionary creatism? 




 Thats the definition 




 Where do you get a definition religion is moral development? 




 Its like a deist who believes in god but doesnt worship, he has no religion.




If you are trying to imply natural religion, that is hardly a religion, and not the sense i mean it in as can be explained in my description and comments, and is really just a technicality that has nothing to do with this topic
 




 Religion hints at a god and or some form of worship. I dont worship natural laws or reason. 




 That is not what religion is. 




 Of course it matters an answer would prove that morals do come from religion. If you cant answer it proves morals do not come from religion. Its a simple question really, that i pose to you again. 




 I dont see how what your saying other than religion is different from mine. 




 No you can be agnostic and teach your children reason and natural laws.



If thats the case my question should be revelant, no? 




 Thats exactly what im saying. You are breaking down morality to its primitive form before reason is truly developed. So primitive moralityy is based mainly off of the natural order of things. As reason evolves, the natural laws dont, so does our morality.



What you are saying im saying but it seemed like you are trying to place an evolved reasoning into primitive morality. When i ellude to morality evolving it can only be one of the two elements as natural laws dont change. 




 How does adam and eve fit in? 




 Morality can be taught in other ways? Then we have no issue. 




 So animals ceased to sin before humans were created? Why wouldnt satan bring sin to the animals? 




 There is no option in surviving, it can be neither good or bad. Its the only option, if you are not surving you are dead, no option.




Its the way you choose to survive which becomes right and wrong. Here you are presented with options. The right and wrong ways to survive are shaped over time through human intelligence and evolving society.




If morals dont come from religion where are you saying they come from? Just curious 




 Thats the topic at hand lol 




 Can you name a moral act a believer can do a non believer cant?




If morals come from religion, there should be an act a person who doesnt learn religion(morals) cant do a religous can. 




 Thats what im after. If sin predates adam and eve how does this story fit into your religous views?? 




 Ok, and your saying original sin didnt start with adam and eve as the bible says, sin existed since animals have? 




 Fair enough. 




 Then back to my first question.  




 When was that distintcion made between how we sin and a dog does is basically what im after? 




 Its a nessacary part of living, as natures laws teach us the path of least resistance. It is neither good or bad, the options you take to complete these nessacary survival steps become good and evil.




I have answered this question if you kindly look through the thread before you pose existing questions. 




 You have to be more specific. Self defense, etc




Can you name an action a believer can do a non believer cant? If a non believer is not taught morals though religion there should be an action a person who is taught religion can do a non taught person cant.  




 Can animals sin? 




 if adam and eve didnt exist neither did the serpent amoung them 




 How does that work? 




 My question is how does adam and eve fit in? If we evolved from animals and animals cant sin, where did original sin come from and how does adam and eve fit in? 




 Ok but that they were without sin at first that gives way to an orignal sin at some point.




If we evolved from animals where did we get the ability to sin? 




 Its neither good or bad its a way of life, its a nessacary part of surviving. There is no option, you eat because you are hungry. Good and bad can only come from options. The way you choose to survive becomes good and bad.




Are you avoiding my question? 




 I thought adam and eve where without sin. There choosing becoming original sin. If you believe in evolution where did this start? Do animals sin? 




 The meaning of morality is the action of meeting your nessacary needs. Thats morality. Good morals are those that cause least suffering. Bad morals are those that cause most suffering.




As we evolve and start living together, ie society, the good and bad evolve and consquently become more clearly defined. 




 Okay that does make sense. Its quite an interesting concept, thanks for your replies and bringing this to my attention. 




 As i attempt to answer your questions only fair to attempt mine. 




 I dont understand the question in context to my answers. It has that meaning, the system you defined it as is created due to avoiding needless suffering. 




 Im trying to understand, and i will investigate further, its quite interesting.




Thinking as a religous person, if God has set a moral guideline how does that become individually subjective? 




 No morality has meaning as we evolve it becomes more clear, and certain actions become unnacceptable in a society.




The morals of a caveman would be differnt of a man living in an evolved society. Again as we grow and our society evolves so does morality.



Name an action a believer can do a non believer cant. 




 No a non believer is not taught morals ftom religion, so there must be an act a person who is taught through religion can do that someone who isnt cant do. I ask it again? 




 This is an interesting concept. Can you elaborate further? 




 Where does the fall come into place? 




 Your first half of post is nonsensical.





To name an action is exactly the point of the post, if you cant name an action it becomes clear morals are not taught by religion. 




 Its part of being an animal. You are hungry you eat its a nessicity. As you take paths to how you eat, you are presented with options. The options that will lead to less suffering become good and vice versa. As humans grow and societies evolve these actions become evolved morally, with the actions to feed these nessacary needs it becomes clear what is right and wrong as society takes form.   




 Yes and that moral system is derived from avoiding suffering. 




 Np 




 Killing life doesnt apply to living life. Survival is an instinct, trying to survive without suffering completely is also an instinct. When you are hungry you eat to avoid starving.



If god is moral explain the flood, the promotion of human sacrifice, slavery,and all the other immoral acts commited in the bible? 



Name a moral act a believer can do a non believer cant? 




 I have no idea, im assuming this is aimed at someone else. 




 Good and bad are derived from the instinct of avoiding suffering. As humans grow and socities evolve right and wrong are defined more clearly.



 




 Name a moral action a believer can do a non believer cant.




IF morals are taught through religion, there should be an action a person never taught religion (morals), shouldnt be able to do a religious can 




 I think it's quite unreasonable to assume morals come from religion, even a Christian reading the bible can tell the immoral things that are happening throughout the bible. It can't be the grounds of morality, if itself isn't grounded. 



Simply have to name a moral action a believer can do that a non believer could not do.  




 If you are not a creationist and believe evolution, how does Adam and Eve fit into your religion. If the Adam and Eve story is for interpretation not to be taken literally then where does original sin come from? 



If you believe in creationism and Adam and Eve story literally, how does this fit together in your religious understanding of the two? 



EDIT the point of this post is not to Offend but an attempt to understand 




 Is it worth reading? What did you think of it?  




 I want to start by I believe we made horrible mistakes once we entered Iraq. The biggest being the dissolution of the Iraq army and the laws that were passed to essentially keep them out, there were many many more but this is the biggest.



The invasion of Iraq was a good thing in these ways. Sadaam was a true representation of evil. All of his evils need not be explained one by one, but I think it's universally held he was evil and poison to the country he was ruling.



 As far as WMD, bush had conflicting reports as to whether they were there or not. Even if the reports leaned in the favor he did not presently own, there was evidence he had been trying to obtain WMD. Should we wait till he had obtained such to invade where he would surely use his obtained WMD in war? He also has the history of using WMD in war. He also stated in his trial, he did give the illusion to having WMD because he was worried if he didn't and it was known Iran would invade. He also I believe in 1998, not sure this exact year, refused to cooperate with having people come into the country to examine if he had WMD or not something he agreed to do in the early 90's.



He was also giving diplomatic immunity to terrorist and war criminals. He might not have had direct ties to bin laden but was aiding other terrorist and war criminals in other ways. The war on terror was not just about bin laden but to all terrorist organizations. 




To summarize, He wAs a terrible person to be in power, giving the illusion he had WMD by his own admission and history of being willing to use such, and aiding terrorist and war criminals. This was a good thing to strip him of his power. With that said we made many mistakes after the invasion. As far as setting up the governing body, dissolving the iraq army,etc. but as far as the decision to invade it was the right thing to do, and it lessened the places terror could operate in that part of the world. Also showing USA would not tolerate these many threats, not one or two, as other leaders have done,  but the many violations sadaam has committed will not be tolerated. Change my views

 I am a former catholic and no longer believe in God. The argument I hear for proof of god is mainly in the things science can't explain. Something couldn't have come from nothing, dark matter, intelligent design, etc. This is nonsensical.



You are essentially issuing in the same behavior ancient civilizations did. They could not understand at the time the weather, the sun, the cosmos, etc so it had to be God. All of the scriptures are written by people who had no such knowledge of the things They claimed to be God, and their lack of knowledge bleeds through as science unlocks more and more.




Now this is not to say God exists or does not exist. This is not my debate but my debate is where people are putting God. I think it quite possible to believe in God and also believe that science will shed light on the places it is the dark. Hence this post. To me is not reasonable in a world where people don't believe in God,or who believe in a different God, that putting on a label on the unexplainable is God. It is logical to put your faith, so to speak, in that science will explain these things in time, and that your belief in God belongs else where.



Now I also want to clarify to do the the things my debate touches on is not wrong, or immoral, it is simply unreasonable, not logical. I know there are many things that can give credence to your personal experiences and the deep thing inside most people there is more to this world than us. And that the proof of God is not a thing that can be measured in scientific terms. But I disagree that the universe, or multiverse, and all it's contents cannot be explained by science, and it's not logical to put god here. Change my views

 First I will say I love both and like alternate versions of the same story. On the other hand I donnot understand the argument that the hotel is represented just as evil as it is in the book(not to be confused with the hotel is not evil in the movie).



Kubrick makes intended changes to the books plot seemingly to down play the true evil of the hotel. Take for instance the different endings. In the book the hotel is destroyed, and the movie it's left standing. If the hotel is as evil in the book as it is in the movie, the hotel should have been destroyed.


Take the maze scene. Kubrick places this maze scene in where Danny is chased by the insane gone over the edge jack. Where as the book jack is possessed by the hotel and chases Danny through the halls, his voice and demeanor is extremely unfamiliar to Danny. Jack seemingly goes over the edge as opposed to being possessed by a the hotel. 



Last example is the hedges. The hotel can control the hedges and bring them to life. As Danny's shine gets stronger and fuels the hotels power the hedges go from just moving their positions, to being able to attack the occupants. This is left out seemingly to downplay the hotels capabilities. That's as good place to start as any so Change my views.

 Love the movie and i get it for the most part. Its an unfiltered view of relationships, sex, power, women's desires being equal to mens, etc. My question is relating to kidmans dream half way through and reaction/response at the end. Was she saying she was part of the secret society and had group sex there, or are the two unrelated? 




 First if you havent seen it, you should watch its informative and entertaining.



Curious to see how many people here agree with Ham? How many agree with Nye? How, on either side you're on, does this fit with your religous beliefs and was anything said that surprised you? Or change what you previously believed? 




 Mine is Pet semetary. The wendingo(i think thats right) lining the back story to the cemetary, just makes this plot brilliant imo.



Almost tempted to rule out The stand now but im interested in the why. So whats your favorite and why? 




 What director would you choose and what actors would you like to see?



Im unhappy with all movie adaptations ive seen so far and would be cool to see different scenarios of who could pull it off? Thanks ahead for your comments 




 I will start by I have struggled with this concept since it has been brought to my attention. I know this movie extremely well, better than I should, and have previously debated just about every scene. Not to say the this conclusion is right but to say I do know the film and the characters well. 



My basic theory stems from, The movie constantly allures to what and how magic is done, which has nothing to do with 'real magic' but with deceit. That's what the machine is deceit.  Will give  a summary of my theory now, leaving out the beginning and end, and details as my post will be too long for any interest. I will elaborate on the beginning and end , and details once the discussion begins.



So Borden does have a twin, tesla is real, angiers visits are fabricated from the diary and his ending speech being as such. Upon Angier capturing Fallon and receiving the key to Borden's diary(tesla) is where I will start. Angier visits Tesla finding out there is no answer to Borden's secret( Angiers original motive), and tesla has no "magic". So he begins to come up with away to frame Borden, not just kill him, but ruin his reputation and acquire custody of his daughter. He uses the fact Borden has sent him to tesla, to begin his frame up. He uses a useless tesla machine to add flair to an old trick, and spark interest in Borden. Angier also needs "real magic" to obtain a theater, no simple trick will do, as Borden hs already ruined his reputation. He uses a double to pull off his trick, with the illusion of being transported. He doesn't drown his double every night just the night of the murder. To ensure Borden will be confused he uses the element of mysterious tanks being transported from the theater every night, otherwise Borden will easily see he is using a double but with the mysterious tanks he sparks enough interest from Borden to want to see backstage, as this is vital for the frame up to work. 



Angier is the pledge and turn and root(or other double if you prefer) is the prestige, ie on the balcony. Angiers motive at this point is no longer magic or the applause it's simply to frame borden. Borden makes multiple appearances at the show wearing a disguise. Angier needs to spot and identify this disguise in order to carry on with the frame up, which is why he doesn't do the frame up the first night he enters the theater, and eventually Angier does discover Borden. Knowing his routine and the fact he will come again because he hasn't been picked to view the machine or backstage, he sets the frame up. Seeing Borden enter the theater he tells his assistant to pick Borden out of the crowd that night, also telling root he will be the pledge and turn for the transported man ( not the other tricks) on this night. As Borden is being picked from the crowd, Angier and root switch, the frame up plays out Angier flees the theater. This is the jist will elaborate further on the end scene and the like upon the discussion beginning.



I will add a few of the questions about the machine working theory that I have, which can be answered by my theory. These questions could be preluded with "if the machine works"



What is the tank Caine and Angier are pushing during the ending scene? If if the last clone is in the morgue, and the tank had been broken to extract the clone what tank are they pushing?



Why store the clones? What not rid of them every night?


What is the air bubble at the end in the only visible tank.



How did Angier gain full control of both his legs while drowning? The movie goes through some length to show how damaged it is, why do this if it's not meant to be.a clue



If Borden sends angiers to tesla, it's his plan, why wait till he has  captured Fallon to give him Teslas name, why not give it to him when he gives Angier the diary?



I have more of my theory to share, and more question to ask those who disagree it this is already too long. Looking for reasonable, logical, light hearted debate, so bring it on reddit change my views

 Why these 2, well I had this debate with a friend recently, i wanted to know what Reddit thinks.




My case is for Leo. I feel Tom cruise is very similar in alot of his roles. Leo to me has taken more risk, is more convincing at different types of roles, and simply picks better movies. And the fact Scorsese works with Leo, amoung many other actors again and again and has worked with Cruise once is odd.




Again tell me who you like and Why?



EDIT: im more interested in your why then who 




 The lead singer and guitar player for the Wild hearts, Ginger, decided to release a solo album. Instead of dealing with the record company, he decided to set up a fundraiser deal. Where people interested in buying his record would send him money. I think the first 10,000 was like 50$ and the rest was 25$. 




The first 10,000 recieved 20 songs then a vote was taken as to which 10 made it on to the record. The top ten made it. Once the songs were finalized the first 10,000 got both the official record and the record of the other 10, i believe in both cd and record format. The ensuing investors received the official record.




I just love this idea. Getting your chance to participate in the making of the record and taking all outside influence away, leaving the artist with complete freedom. Other bands have used this strategy, including Radiohead(not 100% this band).




 REDDIT what are your thoughts? Do you love or hate it? Would you participate? 




 Ozzy and sharon have been fighting the surviving members of the randy rhodes era, over their rightful royalties. Bob daisley and lee kerslake have been trying to receive their fair share but are getting denied. They had ample share in writing the music and recording "Blizzard of Oz" and "Diary of a Madman", although they did not tour on these records.



Ozzy went so far as to remove their tracks and rerecord them when they were remastered. To stay consistent upon the release of the 2 albums box sets, Daisley offered up hours and hours of early takes, demos, and studio outtakes, Ozzy refused because Daisley wanted royalties instead of it being bought outright.




As a lifelong fan of Ozzy, i cannot forgive him for this greed, and i have just recently stumbled upon this. To think you cant even buy the orignal music from the randy rhode era is infuriating. Tell me what you think Reddit.




I dont have links but this can be found with a quick google search. 




 I have watched the film many times, close to twenty. It makes more sense that it doesnt work, really the only thing that makes sense imo. There are clues everywhere in the movie once you grasp the timeline and Angier and Bordens never ending deception (this includes angier's last attempt to fool borden at the very end). 




I wont go into specifics here, but will debunk the theories presented in the discussion. Whether you agree or disagree completely let me know what you think.



EDIT: SPOILER ALERTS 




 My choice would be avatar. The special effects combined with a powerful story just hit the right notes for me. What is your Personal best of the last 10 years?




I also thought django unchained was amazing, and There will be blood that imo has the best acting in the last 30 years.

 I agree with that but thats basically what i just said. There are going to sell more physical copies so it justifies a higher cost but that doesnt reflect the cost difference. They would only have to sell 2.2 million digital to reach the profit of 3.4 physival, but they might not sell as many total if it were only digital.
 




 Im not asking you what you believe is true but how you came to that conclusion and what roles like upbringing and demographic played.



If your answer is i have questioned christianity but came to the conclusion i just know it to be true, thats an acceptable answer. Im just saying i feel you didnt touch on every question so im trying to dig a lil deeper But i respect your answers and appreciate your reply 




 It doesnt touch on if everything in your faith you see eye 2 eye with, why you connect with paul, your upbringing and demographic and their roles? Basically the 4 questions i posed 




 Thats hardly answering the questions i posed, maybe the title but not the ones im after. I do appreciate your replys  




 I understand you think its true. But specifically what about christianity settled these doubts? Did your upbrining play a part? Do you think where you were born played a part in your choice? Are there things inside your faith you dont see eye to eye with? 




 I understand your comments but it offers me no insight in how you have personally dealt with these questions which is what im after. 




 I disagree. One or two of those things maybe not a big contributor but all of them combined becomes a factor.



Lets say its only 2% difference in total cost between digital and tangible. That might not sound like alot but its probaly close to 100s of thousands dollar difference. Especially when your profit margin is higher with digital copies.




Also another reason games are not digitized is the market is higher for physical games. Gamers like the option to be able to trade in games when done and purchase old ones that digital copies cant offer. This is in some way justifies a higher cost to sell more games. 




 You are part of UU? 




 I know the bible well. I want to know how you personally answer these questions not paul. 




 The devil in the white city, erick larson.




Most people i talk to havent heard of it. Its the most entertaining non fiction work imo. A dual story about americas 1st serial killer and the 1st world fair's main architect. The amount of staples in american culture that came from the fair will astound you and the killers dark tale will shock you. 




 Your reasoning is very good. Although i disagree it isnt significantly cheaper. Theres no shipping cost, dont have to invest in boxes or discs, or designers of the two and without having a middle man your profit is higher.
 




 What about the other questions? 




 But have you questioned your faith choice in the forms of the 4 questions posed? 




 Nba has a salary cap which means teams contract cost per year has to be under a certain amount. For ex, say the salary cap is 60million in 2016, that means Golden states player contracts total has to be under 60 million in 2016.  The cap changes based on the previous years leagues earning. The reasoning behind the cap is to control league cost and to keep teams competitive. 




Nba has a "soft" salary cap. Which means there are circumstances in which a team is allowed over the cap. When a team unjustly goes over this cap the penalty is usually minor in the form of a "salary tax". This is different than in the Nfl.



Free agents. A unrestricted Fa is a player whose contract has run out and other teams can make an offer. A rescrited Fa is a player whose contract has run out but in order to sign him conditions apply. Like a team will place a draft pick on a restricted Fa if a team wants him enough and signs that Fa they forfeit a pick to players former team. This condition only last for part of the offseason and allows teams who can meet these conditions to have first dibbs.



Veterans minium is the lowest a team is allowed to pay a vet. The min is lower for those players for are not vets. This bar is usually set during collective bargaining agreements between the owners and players union.



The max is the highest a team can pay any one player. This can vary. Because of a soft salary cap, a team is allowed to go over the cap to keep a player on their roster. Say stephen curry is a Fa. Golden state will be allowed to offer him a higher max deal than clevland, because GS can exceed the cap to try and keep him. This is really to allow small market teams to retain stars by being able to offer them more money, as well as othe reasons.  




 I am a former christian, i still struggle with the idea of God and am curious about certain things ive had troubling answering and how those who still believe personally can/do. My point is not to offend but to understand So i might pry a little into responses with why's and how's. I had a similar post recently that had some enlighting results. 



I will also add i dont think it immoral or wrong to question your faith choice, it is healthy and will only strengthen and enlighten personal truths, whatever that truth turns out to be for you.




Ive always wondered how you can be certain your religion is the right one, Gods intended religion. How much certainity comes from your upbringing and/or demographic and would it be different if some factors were even slightly changed. So i pose a few questions to seek some insight from those who are christians who have undoubtly had the same questions enter their mind and how they responded. And if you havent asked yourself these questions why not?




How can you be sure, out of the countless religions including the different forms of christianity, you have choosen right? And do you think, to those who it applies to, your upbringing and/or demographic has had influence on this choice?




Have you given any effort into looking at other religions and their teaching to confirm your choice? Why or why not?



Have you had moments where you question your choice? If so why or what settled these doubts?




And do you find everything in your religion agreeable, including certain events/passages in the bible? Why or why not?   




 I watch the combine very close every year. I remember the pass rush drills this guy with the crazy hair performing on another level than every one else. I followed up on him tapes stats etc, and b/c of his injury and slow 40 knew he would be a steal for someone.



I couldnt believe we drafted him and if he can stay healthy he will be the best pick of the draft.  




 Thats ok. If you cannot understand the question in terms of adam and eve's story i have no intention of trying anymore. Ive gotten a fair share of enlightening responses. 




 You imply I didn't offer you to make a new thread several times, but you seem to conveintly not bring that up.




Again you like to have discussions in threads that have nothing to do with OPs topic. Thanks for reminding me how fruitless and childish your exchanges are and I will not be responding to any more of them. Please stop sending me messages unsolicited for the third and hopefully final time.  




 You are still referring to having the debate in the wrong thread, what you cant grasp about that is the heart of your childish comments.  




 You never once directed me to one of your threads thats again more of your childish games.




And frankly the jokes on you this interview proves nothing about the prestige. 




 Thats not the truth, i repeatedly tried to move the debate to a more fitting thread, we were in a thread about best film endings not the prestige or its intrepertations, which you refused to do. You would also say i was trying to force you into a debate, followed by messages of you trying to rebute my points in an inapproiate thread. Very similar to what you are doing here.



I have never ducked your points but when you started making comments like the minority is always wrong and such it became apparent a reasonable debate would not be possible. So to continue on in a wrong thread was pointless.




Again, as ive told you 3-4 times now, if you want to debate the prestige make a thread, or lets continue in an existing one. But to forward me a thread where Nolan says nothing to swing the debate 1 way or the other as if it magically proves your right is the kind of thing i can expect from you but will no longer engage in. 




 There is no mention about his early movies nor does he say anything about the prestige. The way you just shrug off anything i have to say about the topic without given my views a chance was quite childish as is this message and i dont see us having any common ground to have a productive conversation.




On the other hand you find Nolan specifically talk about the prestige and the machine i would be interested in that. 




 If you account you being fired for not doing your job or not following the rules, then you refuse to leave this place of buiness(cant call it your job you have been fired), so secruity has to remove you because you refuse to leave this place you no longer have the right to be, and you consider this violence its not only ludacris its nonsensical, and i dont see how we will ever find common ground. 




 Well without complicating things the n word can do the most damage quickly



So if you agree im saying in a simplified way lets stop treating it as more nasty than the other slurs and curses. Not to say its ok to use or victims shouldnt be offended 




 My other big point here is the n word has no equal. So if its used a recipent might feel like violence is the only answer. He cant come back with cracker or spic etc it doesnt have the same power.



So im saying theres 3 options





1 continue to let the n word have no equal. Which im trying to offer an alternative




2 give the n word an equal. This would just seem immplausiable and encourage the behavior that should stop




3. Treat the n word like every other slur and curse. This is very simplified but the heart of my argument here in option 3 




 You can refuse to be humilated by returning the favor it in no ways suggest violence. If you constantly show up late and the boss threatens your job this in no way justifies violence. If you refuse to leave your job after being fired i would assume the police would be called.



It seems you are saying anything you perceive as disagreeable to your views like someone calls you a name in a non violent matter you can justify violence. If i understand this correctly You either have major anger problems or im not understanding your point. 




 Good point on my CMV ill have to rephrase that, as i can see that implying the wrong intention.



Let me start by this, by trying not to use power, would you agree the n word is widely considered the nastiest most looked down upon racist slur? Its more powerful(cant find another way to express) than cracker spic fag, etc.? 




 See we are not coming to a mutual understanding of what a threat is. So its impossible to say the source is a threat when we dont look at a threat the same way.



Your boss can threaten your job, it has no relation to violence.




A racist can say the n word with out the threat of violence with just the intention of trying to humilate you. If you percieve that as violent threat that is a problem.



Now a racist can say hey n ill kill you. Thats obviously a threat of violence that i could agree a physical reaction could be well with in reason. But for that matter in this instance you could replace n with any word and it would still be the same threat.



 




 Its important to call out degarogtory language whenever its used against majority or minority i will first point out.




You imply that im saying the word should just be accepted and treated like someone saying good morning. If you cant see the clear distinction im making this conversation will not be productive. You dont have to agree but if you are drawing the wrong conclusion then the intended one, we are just clarifying previous points instead of making forward progress.




I would suggest reading my post and answers to not only you but others again to get a clear sense of where im coming from. I cant attempt to change my view if you dont understand them. 




 Word powered by a threat or a word powered by a threat of violence? 




 No you completely misunderstand my points.




Racist will always use the word. Its up to the recipent to decide what it means to them and how they respond but this in noway justifies its usage. This lessens the damage done and by no way downplays the words racism or condons people to use it more.



Yes in a way im putting responsibilty on the victim to change what damage is caused because by reacting a certain way you will establish it as a racist verbal nuke that will always be used as opposed to treating it as any other curse. 



But again you keep going back to the possibilty of this, which Is Not the topic. Where the power comes from is. With that said the word is only viewed as racist in certain context, so that just proves the word can be treated as non offensive by the recipent. 




 Great points and one im kind of hinting to specifically. Let me elaborate by compressing the argument i make to 2 races white and black, although the argument is not mutually exclusive to these 2.




A black has no verbal nuke compared to a white having the verbal nuke of the n word. So the best situation is no one has verbal nukes. But by the first statement made in this paragraph the second best option of everyone having verbal nukes is impossible. So the best situation becomes the only one. The only way to suceed at this is to disarm those who have a verbal nuke. This is basically my point im trying to make. 




 By making an analogy you are comparing physical violence to spoken words. I concede that it is not saying they are the same but i strongly disagree with your comparing of the two.




I never stated it would be easy just that it is possible. Furthermore the topic is not about the possibilty anyway but about the source of the power. 




 we disagree that it's a threat of violence. The word has no power, ts nothing more than a word, but the reaction to it gives it power. I don't see how your knife comparison makes sense if the word is not a threat of violence.



That's like someone throwing a plastic knife at you, and you retaliate with a real knife.  




 I don't understand the your point feel free to elaborate.  But you are also saying the threat is one of violence meet with violence, I dont understand your distinction here.  




 Didn't you try to make the point that the power of the word comes from the threAt of violence, a bit contradictory of you wouldn't you say?  




 True, but kind of like Sam harris acting against the taboo of critizing religion, is similar to this post. If you don't bring awareness to taboos they will never change and be accepted.  




 Again where in the definition of worship does it sAy you have to believe in the thing you are expressing revere or adoration for. You are adding to the definition as you please to fit your argument here. It might not make sense to you that worship has to be followed with belief or it doesn't count but that's not how the word is defined, like your armament position on a verb that I disagree with but have conceded because my point is not clearly defined as so the same thing is happening here but you refuse to concede by adding to the definition. 




Again comparing Greece to today is crazy. The war famine mistreatment of women were done to a bigger proportion than it is today by a impossible margin, the actions of such were more widely accepted. 



I'm saying that as human intelligence has grown and societies evolve morality follows suit. I'm saying the ways to survive(morality defined) were not as clear as they are today, the choices are more black and white to what is right and wrong today then it was back then. Not saying there are black and white today but are more clearly defined. 


I could be wrong, but it seems evident IMO you are applying your pre notion of what you think morality is and applying it to my statements as opposed to how I'm defining it(not the evolution of morality but how I define it). It might clear up your points to me if you look at my definition of morality I gave you days ago and apply that to my argument, and then come back with your counter. Might help. 




Evolution absolutely goes forward though a process of natural selection. The species that are less fit for their enviroment don't survive, and evolution moves forward with the rest. Same thing in applying to primitive firms of morality. Sure some forms of morality had some good elements, some bad, some inbetween but though natural selection the less suitable ones die out while the more suitable ones survive and evolve with their surroundings, humans and society.  




 This is ludacris. Physically slapping a person is not the same as speaking hurtful words and if you cannot separate the two there in lies the heart of the problem.  




 I disagree with your comparison, a bully in most cases is using physical violence which is what I have A problem to begin with. And my other point is if thr n word was not as powerful bullies would cease to use it as much.  




 Good points. Emotion reaction is a tricky thing. Again I not saying this is entirely possible to sweep the world. I'm only stating my view is the power of the word is being given to by those who react in such an irrational way. That's where I'm trying to change my views, not the possibility of it.  




 Well then in that case morals do not come from religion.  




 I disagree speakng a word should spark any kind of violence. Someone whispers your address is an area for concern but not one that should be meet with violence.  I'm not saying all who hear the n word reataliate with violence but the ones that do are not justified and to lessen this reaction the sting of the word has to be. 




 Agreed, will also add it's also every animals instinct to reproduce and survive by following the path of least resistance,ie avoiding suffering.  




 Your insults are petty and your intentions made clear by such, I hope for your sake you can learn to interpret statements read in the context they are given. Your lack of interpretation has lead to this fruitless exchange and given no production to the topic at hand, but I assume this is a frequent problem for yourself. A shame you have clouded this thread with pointless banter, and I agree the end of our conversation is at hand.  




 I never claimed you are making it easy. Take it in context of the whole statement. Sure I could take any number of things you have said and break them in half and drive some wild conclusion from as you have been attempting to do. But I don't play those silly games, and you can easily see in the context of the statement it is not a personal attack, or even personally directed at you.



You claim my point on intellectually complex doesn't make sense, now you are saying its a wild claim, followed by one of your own, and im still unsure if you understand my point or are still atempting to.



As far as changing my views, our conversation hasn't gone passed me trying to defend statements you have taken out of context, and cleRing up points I'm trying to make because you either can't understand or have tAken the wrong conclusion. Also now with an accusation of an out of context statement where you are saying I personally directed a statement towards you, which is clearly not the cAse. For a productive conversation to occur these things would have to change. 




 You are ignoring my point I made in the description.  A reaction would still be made but the ones that are being made now are inmost cases are unacceptable. It is in fact a word, it is not racism in one word. 



You act like the word is not constantly used and tolerated in entertainment. If you can hold your teeth in those instances you should be able to do the same when it's used in a different context. 



My point about intellectually complex is quite simple. Most racist are not the most brilliant people in the world. So by giving them one word to describe all the pain hurt suffering oppression slavery racism, you are making it easy. They would never find a way to try to bring that kind of hurt on someone if they had to use more than just one word to do the same damAge.  




 You act like words cannot be harmful to others. Im not saying it wouldbe easy or entirely possible to do but the reaction it receives encourages its usage. 




 If a white just says, hey n, to a black guy, violence will be more likely come from the black who was simply called a word with no threat of violence.  




 Worship by your definition, revere and express adoration for something, could be done by a nonbeliever it doesn't say anything about being genuine or a believer. Again if something has to exist for worship as you keep trying to say, you have to prove God exists to prove your worship is a moral act, or you are simply not answering the question. 



You are simply not seeing my point, you are hanging on your pre notions of morality. Ancient Greece might have had some forms of morals but women were not treated right, slavery,  war, famine, etc to epic proportions. To say Greece was a more intelligent, sophisticated society, with cleArer morals to today, just because of your view of homosexuals is ludacris. You are cherry picking here, and cherry picking there. 



Also again, if you are saying Ancient Greece is more morally sound I would ask you to elaborate, it's quite obvious to me. Again can you show a source of evolution going backwards?  




 Yea im saying the reaction should be no different than someone calling you d1ck, bastard, etc 




 Sure but by that reasoning anything is impossible. The post is not really about the possibility anyway, its about the premise. But your points are well said and noted. 




 Not expecting someone racist to be intellectually capable is the point, you chop a leg out from under the incapable racist to express them selves. Did you read the sentence that followed?




Charleston shooting only furthers my point about trying to lessen the damage done by 1 word. 




 But the reaction of shithead is not in the same ball park. If it is treated the same its usage and hurt caused would dramatically reduce.




My point is by treating the word this way you strengthen the ways a racist can hurt you verballyy. In fact you make it easy. They can hurt you deeply by one word anyone with half a vocabulary can say, as opposed to having them do the same verbal damage by other more intellectually complex ways. You add intellectually complex and you take half the racist off the table right there ever finding a way to express there racism. 




 Good points. But when racist do use it, it is used to yeild its negative effects and get a reaction. Im saying if it stops receiving a reaction, gradually over time it would limit usage of the word by racist, and even when used it would cease to be anything more than your a d1ck, a bastard, etc



Sure racist will always find a way to be offensive but im trying to make the point by lessing the power of the word you lessen their racist aresnal and strip them of their most powerful verbal weapon. As opposed to loading the weapon for them and just awaiting the war. 




 I did in my description, the reaction. 



White and black arguing, white calls black basterd, its offensive but doesnt get a over reaction, major mood change , or violent outburst consistently. Now that white uses the N word and those exact reaction avenues just explained go up dramtically, to where its one , or a combo of the three consistently almost inevitable 




 Of course a non believer can. I can walk into any church and take part in the mass, and worship with them. I can walk out still a non believer and have worshipped with believers. That can be seen by fellow believers and god as a moral act, might not be genuine but now your defining worship however you want. When did genuine mutually exist with moral?

So let's say god doesn't exist, then your worshipping a non existent god, that worship would cease to be a moral act in your way of thinking. So now you would have to prove god exist for your worship to be one a moral act.



No morals have not regressed. A universal morality is much better than it was 200 yeArs ago. The places where you refer to that make women inferior are religious based, and therefore are hanging there morals on books that were written in  a time of a primitive form of morals. It can also be assumed following immoral ways to survive. Morality evolving does not mean every one chooses to be moral. Morality can be light years evolved and there will still be people who choose immoral and who influence others. 




Morality evolving, again, defines things more clearly. 300 years ago the inferior women you refer to would still be seen as morally ok. But as we evolve it's more universally held that what's going on there is wrong. Even though slavery has happened somewhat recently not everyone agreed with this. The fact it's not happening in the USA now is a sign of progress coupled with the fact that our country is run on evolved morals.



You could bring up sadaams recent regime, but nothing in his regime reflects evolved morals. I can't make this any clear just because morals evolve does not mean that everyone chooses the right path. Having a universal moral does not rid of evil or bad morals. It only makes clear what paths you take to survive are good and bad. 



So your argument that morals haven't evolved because people are still acting immoral that's simply ludacris. Can you give an example of where evolution goes backward?  




 To your point about worship counting, is this, let's say god exist and even though as a non believer you are not sure about the existence of god but worship anyway this would of course be seen as a moral act by god, what would you define this as immoral? wBut again this is a slippery slope and we could both hang on technicalities and interpretations but once you start hanging on mental actions that could not be proven, it can't be proven for me to say the opposite and cancel your argument out. But I don't see a point in that direction, but again if you want to proceed with this in a proven, not directly canceling out, action I'm open to that direction.



You are confusing maturing with evolving. A person can lose their maturity at any given moment, see Donald's trump recent statements. I'm talking about evolving. A collective human evolution has taken place that doesn't go backwards, we are not turning back into apes, same thing with morality. It doesn't go backward it has evolved with time in the same way. As we grow and explore the options I have described and their consequences the good and bad are clearly defined. 
 




 I guess we will have to just disagree , you are walking a fine line in defining action. For that matter an even finer line when you consider the original question. The "action" you are referring to cannot be observed and happens internally, for that matter I could play the game of a non believer could worship, he doesn't have to believe to worship, and you can't prove he is not worshiping because it's not observable it's all internal. You could say a believer can think of god that's moral, that's an action, but without it being observable you are just playing games with the question, which should have multiple answers that aren't trying to play a fast one. Again I could easily say well a non believer thought of god. But I won't play that game, I'll leave it there.   



The other half of our conversation is still open ended.  




 To imply all people who don't believe in religion are immoral is a bit disturbing, then to go and lump non religious people in with if you don't believe in god you can't be moral is very concerning.  




 We had a long conversation it's just a little unsatisfactory for it to end this way for me when we had a reasonable back and forth and now you won't acknowledge a verb is not always an action, or for that matter the points we left on evolution of morals not degressing. But if that's where you want to end, not being able to prove your points on verbs, or elaborate further, that's fine, but the progress we had at first tempted me to continue what at one time was a reasonable exchange. 




Ok, well you are just wrong on worship not being a state of being. Worship happens in your head, it's not an action. But if your right you should be able to use worship as an action. That's the question can you use worship as an action(as opposed to the other meaning of Verb)in a sentence for me? 


 




 Thats the equivalent of saying a noun is a place, that's all there is to say about it, it can't be a person because it's a place.  




 You do understand a verb is not always defined as an action, right? Lol 
 




 No attempt on a sentence? 




 I'm not excited(I find your assumption of tone quite comical) simply trying to understand your confusion, which after 200 responses no one else as had.I'll try one more time, I'm asking Christians about the story of Adam and eve(as this post shows many consider the original sin, but again you are hanging on the title not the description) and how this relates to your belief. If you have no relation of the two whatever you define as original sin if it has nothing to do with Adam and Eve then it's not really what I'm asking.



Furthermore I'm asking about your beliefs, mine are irrelevant but you keep wanting me to define. I'm asking simply what you believe about this story and how it fits into your beliefs, not what I believe about the story and how it fits into your belief. 




 Did you even read the description or did you just read the title?  




 Fair enough 




 I don't agree with you. But the burden of proof is on those to prove morals come from religion I've already stated my case. 



To name an action, I gave a coat to a homeless man yesterday.  




 You can believe in god and not believe morals come from religion.  These two can exist without the other.




I was religious for a long time but this is irrevelant to the point.  




 The burden of proof is not on me, I'm not trying to prove morals come from religion.  




 How does the story of Adam and Eve fit into those beliefs, what does it mean to those beliefs,and do you take it literally figuratively? 



Usually the concept of original sin refers to mans first sin, ie the Adam and Eve part of my description 




 The first sin of man 


I mean I'm speaking of original sin in context of Adam and Eve I don't know how else to explain that 




 The story of Adam and Eve 




 Adam and Eve being the story of original sin and how that fits into your beliefs? 




 Just the adam and eve story, are you an evolutionst or creatonist and how does the adam and eve story fit that choice and how do they both fit into your belief? 




 Fair enough 




 Except for the priest..... 




 For that matter i even thanked you for your replies as others. I have treated everyone respect who has treated me the same. Your accusations are quite comical 




 Who did i badger lol? 




 Lol seriously, where did i say it belongs to me. I was simply telling you what i was looking for as opposed to ignoring your responses. But i guess you prefer the latter dually noted 




 Lol, you are an idiot. You are saying jesus did write about mary now? You are saying the catholic church predates the old testament? You are saying the catholic church wrote the new testament but doesnt base its teachings off of it?



Your ignorance has reached comical proportions, thanks for the laughs. I feel bad for the church that you claim it but then again the catholic church has done more than its fair share of ignorance and evil. 




 There is no right or one answer i seek. I have received many enlighting answers btw, shed much light on the topic for me




As a person who use to have faith this was an issue for me, i wanted to see how people of faith deal with this




The only unnsatisfactory part i have had, is people who have given me legit answers, gotten a few knuckle heads who turn defensive and answered nothing, about how adam n eve fit into their beliefs refuse to answer if this is an issue that they think about 




 "Soon youll be jerking it thinking bout money" haa



I always wondered if he lost weight for that role or he was that skinny because of dallas buyers club 




 Well the fact your faith is shakeable like mine i dont find it revelant, im trying to get the other end of the spectrum but with thqt said i do appreciate your replies. 




 Im trying to imply if you have no belief in original sin this post isnt for you.  How do you even get that assumption? 




 You added something different, if it such a weird thread why do you continue to post in it. 




 Im looking for believers to answer this but if thats how adam and eve fit into your faith thats what im asking. 




 What do you mean by your post? Why is my age revelant? 




 You can still believe in God and not think morals come from religion, fyi. 




 Np, and your answer does shed some light no doubt. But your faith as mine is shakeable so to say, im trying to get the other side of the spectrum. But i do appreciate your replies. 




 Yes if your trying to explain how they fit into Your beliefs. 




 Nontrinitarism is a form where jesus divinty is in question.




Thats not a teaching thats an assumption, how could jesus teach that, he was dead before mary. I am former catholic of 19 years, been baptized, been to countless sunday schools and church, have also been confirmed, none of this is relevant. The whole catholic church and its teaching are based on the bible!  A fact, buddy. You are saying its not, explain?? 




 I mean the point of the post isnt to make you feel less of anything. As a former person of faith it was something i struggled with and i wanted to see how others with faith deal with this.




As far as answering my question you no longer believe so no you cant answer my question, but i do appreciate your post. 




 Where are any of "his" teaching not found in the bible??



Once again do some research. 




 What part of earth have they been banished from? 




 Answer me this can you name a moral action a believer can do a non believer cant?



If morals come from religion, there should be an action a person who isnt taught religion(morals) cant do a religous can.



EDIT 




 Im not questioning your faith or the doctrine. Im simply asking do you believe in creationism or evolution and how does adam and eve (original sin) fit into those beliefs? 




 There are forms of christanity where jesus is not divine strictly speaking do some research.




If jesus is divine and his teachings are in the bible, what is christanity based off of if not the bible? 




 Fair enough or he was simply highlighting the negative first and making sure not to lump everyone together second. But to each his own intrepretation 




 Is the new testament not the bible? In some forms of christanity is jesus not God? 




 Why give whites that power? Why let them have that ultimate trump card? Slavery and oppression is not that long ago, true but why let all that hurt pain suffering be brought up with one word any ignorant being with half a vocabulary can say? Why not let it go and cease the racist yeilding its power by not given it any?




Not said to be offensive, or downplay its serious nature, Just an honest why? 




 He did say some are good people. 




 Is the bible not considered the word of God? Is christanity religion not based off the bible? 




 People who are oppressed for a long time feel the need to be open about who they are and want to use their freedom to say so. As people like them hadnt always had such freedom.




If being gay wasnt a crime or a thing that people look down for such a long time they might not feel the need to express their freedom.



Never been to the south? Parades for st8 people all the time. 




 Evolution doesnt go backwards.





Use worship in a sentence as a verb that shows action not a state of being 
























 Avatar was badass 




 They both die in their respective movies, be kind of tricky to pull that off. 




 John travolta(vincent vega) and Micheal Madsen(vic vega) are brothers. Just watched quentin tarantino confirm this, ive watched these movies many times never noticed this.   




 Thats pretty powerful 




 I quote this alot, i really love it. Kind of even fits into Sam harris and the like views' on morality. But not even looking at it in that light, a quote that really sums up lifes lessons and a healthly way to view them.By the great Alexander Dumas from the epic "The count of monte cristo".






"There is neither happiness nor misery in the world, only the comparison of one state to another, nothing more. He who has felt the deepest grief is best able to experience supreme happiness."  




 You summon the Devil and realize he is the better(moral) of the two. God is more true to the old testament version, willingly letting sin thrive. The bible was falsafied to gain worship, the source of power for any higher being. The Devil names you as the prophetic messengar to change the worlds view, and lead those to worship, give power to, Satan......

 Intelligence is not only defined by the ability to create. 




 Just watched this fight, Wow. Easily one of the best ive seen. 




 Ali gets out classed in that one imo, i think their 3rd fight was the best ever though 




 This is not true, for all states. In louisiana the state is notified regardless of an sr22 if your policy is revoked. There are also constantly rising financial  penalties for this as well.  




 I have actually seen this fight, no bout about it epic fight.  




 When I look around at the world, look like god is taken a 10 count right now 




 Yes, but in some cases when wages increase it's to combat the fact that prices of goods( walmart) have already increased. So in some way it's too even out raised prices. 
 




 They train there body, to the point they actually stretch their stomach. I'm sure some purge, but I would believe most exercise on a daily basis. They also do not eat like this all the time, they go through periods where they train, and go back to eating more normal proportions when they are not. 



I will also add, I assume this process is not the healthiest of things to put your body through and most will have consequences from this at some point in life.  




 This is a high risk policy. It cost an insane amount compared to regular insurance. It is mandate in louisiana for years after a DUI or DWI. It is essentially the same as a standard policy but it cost more because of your history and the risk it takes to insure you.




I'm sure there are other reasons, I can only speak to my experience in Louisiana and in my case it was a requirement after a DUI. I also had to ride out the years it was required to have without further incident or the requirement time would be longer. I pay about 70$  month now, but during my sr22 period it was over 200$ per month.  




 The best I ever saw was the thrilla in Manila. Like to watch other great fights but don't know where to start, help?  




 Religion shapes a warped view of reality. Most religions are not compatable with what we know about the world today. Not having a religion does not make a person cease to ask the questions that are important to us all, we just look for these answers without using fairy tales. 




It seems ludicrous to me to believe a book from 2000 years ago, obviously written by people who had no idea how the universe worked. Much more reasonable to look for answers from those who do.  




 I'm not really religious but you learn more from your failing then you do from succeeding. An old poker player can tell you every bad beat he had but have a harder time telling you all his winnings. Pain can be a powerful lesson. Suffering, as you described it, on a small scale can be a powerful teacher.



I'll leave you with a quote from the great Alexander Dumas, " There is no happiness or misery in the world, only the comparison of one state to another, nothing more. He who has felt the deepest grief is best able to experience supreme happiness."  




 Yes you get certain antibiotics for certain infections. When a cut on your foot gets infected you will get one set of antibiotics, and when you get a tooth infection you get another set. 




Also you can use antibiotics from your cut foot incident to help with your tooth infection. Antibiotics will help bring down your infection no matter what they were designed for. Why? That I really don't know but I have also heard many times it is not good for your body to take antibiotics for one infection when they were designed for another. 




 To add, another aspect of slavery rarely touched on was the price of goods. The south and it's products such as cotton could basically charge whatever they deemed. The north could not effectively combat these prices by boycott because the south wasn't paying their workers so a boycott would not effect them much. The north could only hold out for so long, they needed the products offered from the south.




So slavery was a human rights issue in one hand but also very much an economic of goods issue that had nothing to do with the terror of slaves or improving their livelihood  




 Mohamed is the most important one though. Jesus is basically the Christians Mohamed, with Christianity adapting Moses And Jesus as one of a few of their prophets. I assume this depiction has been an issue and probably still is but it's just not of the same importance as Mohamed who represents worshippers of today, as where Jesus and Moses in the Quran represented a certain people in a certain time.  




 Thanks for the links, although I do feel this thread has specific questions not touched on in several of the threads I read.  




 A prophet according to the Quran has been sent to each people throughout time, where Mohamed was sent as the last one for all mankind instead of for a specific people in a certain time in history.



A prophet is sent to portray gods law though actions and will power without nessicarily calling for his worship. A prophetic messenger is sent to reveal gods law by calling for his worship and people to follow him.  




 There are over 100,000 prophets in The Quran, maybe more. Jesus was amoung them, so yes important I never said unimportant but not the same importance as Mohamed. Mohamed was the only prophetic messenger from god, Allah. That's why Mohamed's' depiction is so deeply protected.  




 They are not concerned with these figures like Mohamed and they are not depicted as being as important either. 




 Muslims do not use or worship the bible. Their religious book is the Quran. The one true prophet in their religion is Mohamed. Jesus and Moses are not depicted the same and do not have the same importance in the Quran as they do in the bible. 









 Sequel is good 2  




 The way people retain information is almost individually exclusive. I have found highlighting quite effective. Really was just offering different avenues to travel to retain what you read, which was the topic at hand. 




 One of the sentences you pointed out does need some restructuring but most of what you brought up is just rephrasing the sentence to your liking. It's mostly your opinion on how you would write it as opposed to being grammatically correct. There are issues grammatically but not to the extent you are portraying. I do need to improve the effectiveness of punctuation. 



I disagree it doesn't have a good flow, which is mainly determined by opinion anyway. We can both read Hemingway and agree its good, well structured, grammatically sound but disagree on flow.



 




 Lighter would change the meaning of what I was trying to get across to you about the sentence in question and it's meaning. 


The "trip" sentence I see nothing wrong with in the story. Again I do like the concept of the story being written by an insane person who hasn't returned from the dark. I will experiment in my next draft to bring to life the insanity of this "author" and his plea for others to take this trip.  




 The revenant





Avatar 2 whenever this damn movie gets released 




 A long one 




 A misconception is actors can only do what they have done in the past. You can tell a great actor by diversity in his roles, so i do like Rockwell for this role as ive said but dont limit yourself thinking well this actor has never done this type of role so it means he cant.




I think Affleck seized the opportunity to work with one of the greatest directors in recent history. The first time i saw this movie it blew me away. But Fichers movies are so great b/c of their rewatch ability imo. I cant tell you how many times ive watched fight club, girl with dragon tattoo, etc




But affleck just doesnt hold up in multiple viewings after the script and its twist are revealed imo. With that said i think his directing will only improve a great deal from this point on. Makes me wish he was still doing Kings The Stand. 




 Thanks for the post, im glad you enjoyed it. Not sure how clear my intentions are, but i really like this concept and will probaly do a couple more drafts. 




 Robbins is probaly too old, rockwell is a thought. That guy from who played the villian in guardians of the galaxy, lee pace i think he would be a better choice than affleck. I still think leo would have nailed this, and rooney was made to play that part. 




 I appreciate your help. 



The second sentence is saying your dark(madness) side is linked to your light(sane) side no matter if you try to deny or confirm. A denial would be frail and weak and to confirm is bold and strong.




Good call on a few sentences there. Although i do like the idea "i have taken the trip some say i have never returned" so that madness plays a part in sentence formation and structure. Although this was not my intention it is a fruitful thought   




 Wouldn't underestimate him 




 I'm not a big fan of affleck especially in that movie, I do think his directing is damn good though. Great movie and pikes was good I have to say but I think Leo and Rooney would be a must see version. 




 Gone girl.  Leo dicaprio and Rooney Mara  




 Can you elaborate on cleaning up, I'd love some critical input  




 That's great to have someone to really delve into your story to where they offer insight into the little details. It did have a sort of "gameish" feel to it. I also found it quite cool I didn't realize the titles' relationship to the story till the end, and it hit me like a cold shower. 




I just offered a short story myself would like to know what you think.  




 This is hilarious. You are probably very close to the truth. 




 Where do you get trailers from? 



Edit, When it comes to movies, sites or critics almost never have the same taste as you, and when they do about a specific movie it's simply by chance. I don't rely on some site telling me what's good, what's bad, they are all inconsistent to my liking. I never use them, I watch a movie and make up my own mind before being infiltrated with ideas of others.  




 Write it down, dont type but write it down. The most important parts, however you want to summarize it. Use a sheet for every chapter and then you can go back and read what you wrote.




I dont know specifics but something about writing things down or even highlighting passages helps your brain to remember. 




 Great story, in some weird way it was like the movies Cast Away meets Ghost. I dont say that to undermine your extremely well written story just a thought that  popped in my head as i was getting to the end.




I was in a trance from start to finish, thanks for sharing. 




 Not me, some of my favorite movies do not have good scores to such a low degree in some cases i would never have attempted to watch. Once i found this out i lost any trust in those sites  




 That was very good. Your imagery is powerful and a steady flow to your story. I love the direction of a dark trip to an eerie forest, quite great imo. Thanks for your reply, only question did you truly return??




My only critque is the 2nd me, the 3rd me, i think keep that sense of dark mystery in naming the guides. 




 Red lights 




 That guide can lead you to not watch movies that have bad ratings you might have enjoyed imo 




 The music you know you can find its what happens off stage where the mystery is 




 We become the plague that unleashes the Plague.


I really enjoyed this, the flow you write with is impressive. It kind of grabs you and never lets go to the end. One of the better stories ive read so far. In a very distant way reminded of the stand by king. Thanks for sharing 




 I found it quite interesting. An atheist trying to find supernatural meaning ending in tragedy. Even with its unfavorable outcome and unreasonable evidence he never released that supernatural feeling. Like a non believer who knows you cannot prove something doesnt exist, but knows there is a possibility, he chose to indulge in the small chance of the supernatural that he cant bring himself to apply to the grand scheme of things, but instead applys it to his intimate side and emerse his love in the supernatural. Maybe not the authors intention but it provoked my reaction none the less. 




 I enjoyed this alot, well written. 




 To defend your madness is to defend your sanity. They are infinitely linked, eternally combined, a part of all of us no matter the frailty of the denial or the strength of the conformation. We are all trapped in our heads, there is no escape, there is nothing more. Our minds are a small galaxy and each of us add to the multiverse of the human existence. With your bloodline being your universe. We are all on the deepest levels at an extreme distance from each other but on a cosmic scale ever so close. We can if we really try and reach out, attempt to connect, like a highly advanced telescope spying on the surrounding cosmos, and dig into the endless wonders of the neighboring universe. And if you know how and what to look for the data can be immense and overwhelming. But never the less an illusion to a true connection.






We are all moving away from each other at a staggering pace, starting from the time we began. We hide parts of ourselves that can never be found, and with enough time not even by the hider themselves. Our secrets overlap secrets that overlap secrets that's overlapping a distant face of the Truth. The part of ourselves that are hidden are locked in a safe that's filled with other smaller safes. It is reopened from time to time and a smaller safe with a different combination is neatly tucked in next to all the rest. The individual combinations are lost over time and consequently only so many safes can ever be opened.






Even when you think you have successfully connected with a distant galaxy it is only an illusion to the true contents. You only receive ripples from an ever filling lock box. The real makeup of any soul is only fragments of the Truth. You can trace back their steps, study their orbits, even predict future reactions, and gather all the evidence available. But alas in the end you are only left with theories and no observable science to test, no universal key to their lock box. The mysteries that are trapped there are most not even obtainable to the author(hider) themselves, lost to the dark side. 






Living inside this false illusion is where the light shines brightest, you can only expose your forgotten past, hidden truths, and the origin of your true nature by exploring the Dark Side of your Mind, the side of your mind that's orbit never touches the light. A trip there and you will never return the same, if you return at all. The Madness, the Darkness, it will forever be intertwined in your being, grabbing ahold, tightening its grip and never letting go.







But there in that darkness will be the long lost combinations of your past, and the keys to your future. The trip is worth the burden, outweighs the risk of never leaving the comfort, the light. To make this trip is to make the most of your galaxy and better understand the multiverse that surrounds us all. My trip has been satisfying and enlightening, although some say I have never returned. But I find solace in something the great Alexander Dumas wrote, " There is neither happiness nor misery in the world, there is only the comparison of one state to another, nothing more. He who has felt the deepest grief is best able to experience supreme happiness." 




       

So Travel to the Dark Side of your Mind and contend with your Madness.  




 Well written., i would be interested in reading more of micheal and irene.



Might add a little depth to throw  in Irene's love of medicine or something to that effect, in the beginning. 




 Dear g,


Stop wasting your time and energy with me. Live your life with no more thought of the divine. Plunge into the depths of reality treading new paths where ever you go.

Make sure in your final moments , as the movie of your past and present plays out you are not filled with Regret but overcome with a feeling of having Reinvented the Gods. Only then will we meet, and i know you've got an entertaining film, so i got my popcorn ready, so 2 say.



GOD



Ps. Dont know how you got my email but wont fare you well to give it out. Dont reply, Im watching movies

 What?!? I thought house of 1000 corpses was better but devils reject was damn good IMO  




 Any favorites? 




 Yea that was a good debate but it wasnt really a debate on the existence of god, it was evolution vs creationism.

 




 You like the film b/c you havent read the book. The movie with guy pearce literraly could change just the characters names and it could be called something else. 




 Good fellas 




 The devils rejects is the sequel to house of a 1000 corpses.




Anything rob zombie directed will be what you are looking for. 




 I think everyone has seen this 




 This has nothing to do with the topic, thats what i was referring to.  




 Any thats debateable 




 Never heard of dillhunty ill check him out. I agree with the great debates are very entertaining,i like the discussion videos too  but i like more of a back and forth though.



Harris and Wolpe, wolpe makes some solid points if you havent seen it. Nothing to doubt your views but he had an impressive case imo. Thanks for the reply 




 Ive watched alot of dawkins harris and hitchens. If there are any other great atheist debaters would love some recomendations. With that said what has been your favorite debate?




My fav: harris vs wlc, although hitchens vs hitchens is like a 1b 




 The tub offers more protection. I believe the middle of the house is the safest place. Not 100% though 




 Im not christian was curious to dicuss with those who are. We really arent "discussing" anything you are just throwing insults around. I dont understand how discussing ones beliefs show fear and predjudice, but again they are both quite obvious in your comments.  




 Acapolypse now. I dont think this war movie will ever be topped. 




 Yea I looked it up, you are right about the draft picks. So just my example was wrong but restricted fas do come with conditions.  




 Nba cannot use draft picks on restricted Fas? 




 I was not displeased just drawing a comparison to the way you make comments and comments you critize. 




 How do you see discussing others belief as fearful or predjudice of their beliefs? Can you see how your comments convey exactly that of fear and predjudice? 




 Its funny you make comments like these and critize mine 




 Im looking for personal viewpoints, so any who answer the questions fron their experience is satisfying. Ive made up my mind to my truths im curious how others arrived at theirs 




 Well said, thanks for touching on all topics 




 Lol, your childish insults are quite comical. 




 How do the gay people in your church justify worshipping a book that says they are going to hell? 




 Thats kind of sad. If i understand you dont think you have a choice to decide is quite a depressing thought. If you are going to spend your life worshipping you should have a choice and weigh your options. 




 Can you attempt the 4 questions asked? 




 Why have you choosen the "right" religion for you and can you attempt to answer the 4 questions? 




 Well said thanks for touching on all the questions i asked 




 Thats the same avenue i found, to me the only rational avenue to take. But im curious how others came to their path answering the same question 




 Im looking for how you answer the questions posed. 




 The rationlization you prefer to is what im after, i understand how it works. How do you personally rationalize it? Can you answer the 4 questions? 




 Yea dont have that option 




 Cant highlight or copy n patse 




 Well said thanks for the reply 




 Can you answer on the 4 questions in the description?  




 Cant copy and paste so that would be more trouble than its worth. But thanks for the link i see how its done now 




 It still doesnt give me an option unless you are manually typing the quote in 



Thanks for answering those 4 questions, no need for specific disagreements to be mentioned just wanted to know what you already provided 




 im not being critical and you can choose to see it that way. Im either addressing the fact they didnt answer the questions, only answered one, or askin them to elaborate on answers.



I dont see that as aggressive but i see at as inquirying further those who are interested enough to reply. If you dont like it thats ok i dont feel alot of posters see it that way 



EDIT: i also believe some people read just the title and skip the description, so some just might not know im looking for more than the title 




 Yea i dont have that option 




 Thats not really adressing the questions though, forget the title, the 4 questions in the description and your personal take on them 




 Read the description, no need to rewrite them 




 Np 




 Can you touch on the specific questions? 




 I dont see how that answered any of my questions 




 How do you quote, cant figure it out? Ill adress them in order




Most historical claims in the bible come under much scrutinty even by christians




Do you think if you were brought up in a different enviroment you would have found a different religion?




So you have looked to see what other religions offered or not?




There are some controversal things in the christian faith, do you agree with all of them? 




 Well said, thanks for touching on all questions. 
























 He admitted that, Wait!!! he didnt just run away??? WTF, thank your lucky stars you wisened up. Thats some creepy shit



"Hey wtf are you doing"



"Im smelling your garbage for cum!!!"




You fucked up my head, forever. 




 Blast music, walk around naked and let hang 




 My fav. Other bands with multiple 10/10 records is pink floyd, sabbath, iron maiden, lynyrd shynyrd, and the beatles.




These are not my top bands either, its hard to put a perfect record. I love the allman bros, dream theater, silvertide, deep purple, Srv, hendrix but these bands didnt have multiple 10/10 records imo, most just one or none. Floyd i think has three so they gotta be right under zeppelin in this catergory. 




 Coda i dont count, its mostly early seventies stuff anyway, put out after bonhams death it was more a complilation of b sides than new material. I love all their albums except in though the out door. Its ok but dont even sound like zeppelin imo. But 3 and presence are 9/10 for me, the rest 8/10, and in though the out door 6/10. 




 Im not saying more than half make that amount. Im simply stating that 99% is not an average as you suggested. I was offering jobs that can be readily identified as having tattoos be a non issue. The topic at hand has nothing to do with averages.




You are just bitter cause your sister is a slut machine. 




 An average does not mean 99% lol




Your insults are childish and your stats do not reflect your statements. Its quite clear you are talking out of your ass look at our corresponding comment votes 




 10 out of 10 no doubt. I love every album they have done with in though the out door being a like more than love. But those four are better than most albums.




Others id rate 10/10




Dark side of the moon




Tokoyo Tapes




Number of the Beast




Black Sabbath




Master of Reality




Core 




 Completely wrong. The album was popular because the music was great had nothing to do with Bon scotts death. If the album sucked it wouldnt be a best seller of all time, you kind of made my points for me.




The music was written before scott died. They record the music then do vocals as every album acdc has ever done. Bon died shortly after the music was recorded.



Bon scott and brian johnson have completely different sounding voices.




Ac/dc was on the rise in the late 70s, highway to hell was their most sucessful album up to that point. Back in black was a product of their rising fan base and would have been a sucess regardless of scotts death. 




 You cant even keep the topic at hand, its 5 figures genuis.




Your stats are made up and quite wrong. Your views are extremely biased and ancient to say the least.




Common pratice to put an edit in when you make one btw 




 Led zeppelin 2




Untitled




Houses of the holy(best album ever imo)




Physical Grafitti 




 I agree with everything you said, except that getting a tatto is irresponsible. 




 How do you know what he was smelling for? 




 Led Zeppelin 




 Its simply not the truth, sure there are people who still have a similar 50's mindset like you but they are few and far between, and you are wrong as ive explained.



Dealing with the public is not the same as dealing with clients. A dinner can be had where you wear long sleves. But that has nothing to do with the topic.



Take athletes, musicians, actors. chefs, techs, etc 




 Focus on your breathing nothing else. In and out, in and out, do this until the background noise in your head stops, eventually it will.




EDIT: Take long deep breaths 




 Ac/dc fame had nothing to do with bon scotts death. The others ill agree with.
 




 Your reasoning is from 1950. Tattos are much more accepted today and as long as you dont have a rare job of being in the public eye its a non issue. 




 Crown and seven 




 /r/shortstories I find it damn interesting and wish more people gave imput. 




 My friend does, he is an enviromental engineer. Covered in tattoos, both arms and back. A masters' degree will turn your tattoos invisible. 




 Undercover Brother 




 See thats the thing she dont leave, bitch we dating you dont live here. 




 Sam harris, Richard dawkins, and the ghost of Hitch. 




 Who ever owns the car, regardless of driving. 




 Superfly 




 Shes still there long after i nut. 




 /r/changemyviews. Its simply retarded, the first person who post who doesnt "change your view" can complain to the mods and get your post removed. Has happened a couple of times to me and i didnt get any notice of them removing it. When i messaged about why, the mod who contacted me said he wasnt sure for the removal reason b/c he didnt remove it lol. When this process started again i simply unsubscribed and havent been back. Frustrating to say the least. 




 How do you justify luck in front of brady? 




 Most retarded list ive ever seen. 




 In a way you could say that. But hawking works specifically on trying to find the TOE, even his discoveries on singularites, black holes etc is direct progress into getting to a possible TOE, but if you dont see any connection to each his own. 




 We understand his discoveries, its his discoveries that have lead to a better understanding of the universe mathmatically, understanding the universe mathmatically is how you get to a TOE.




Was hawking the first to write down a more complicated black hole? 




 Clarify but it seemed like you took the route of defensively clarfiying your points, just an observation. 




 Just because you have a theory thats incomplete doesnt mean you cant make progress towards one, kind of nonsensical to think that way. His discoveries have no doubt lead us closer to a possible TOE, we have to understand things he discovered in order to get there.




Ill have to look up the black hole thing, unless you know who was first off hand?




Ill take your word on radiation. He also has come out saying something along the lines of matter disapears in a black hole, which isw hy we cant unify einsteins theories, something controversial along those lines.  




 You come off as defensive when i put before and after my statement "im not sure", "not 100%", "i thought" , and then treat them as black and white statements. 




 Black holes were known to exist but i thought he was the first to put it on paper.



I thought there were much contraversey surrounding his radiation theory.




He has made progress in getting to a universal theory, i didnt say one existed.




You come off as being defensive, im really just trying to pick your brain, no harm no foul. 




 Yea you cant have seperate sections here anymore. But as a smoker i respect that where food is served no smoking should be allowed any where.  




 Im not sure that is proven. I would think his biggest contribution is figuring out how to express a black hole mathmatically, but not 100%.




He has also made immense progress in the Theory of everything. The theory Einstein greatly desired to find. 




 Getting worst. Right now its banned anywhere food is served, and inside any public place. 




 Yep i do the same with my buds, evens out the shitty tobacoo.




The push and pull is not that bad but is time consuming. If i only smoke home rolled i would upgrade. 




 Yea here you can buy booze anytime and walk freely around with any beverage. Its not like that every where though, most states only sell booze up to a certain time and you cannot walk in public with an open alchol beverage. You have to stay in the bar or facility where drink was purchased.




Yea pretty much anywhere in the states you can have alchol in the car but its illegal to open any such drink in the car regardless of your blood toxicity level. Thats why a daquri shop is insane because the drink is open already. Would seem to a reasonable person these places are breaking the law the moment they had you the drink.




No if you get caught elsewhere in the states walking around with opened alchol its a crime but not driving crime. Only if you have open beverage in car, regardless of blood level. They can also take you to jail for refusing a breathlizer.




I dont know how Dui work in germany and ofcourse its frowned on everywhere but Louisiana is very tough on Dui. Its like a $500 fine, mandatory jail time, $500 in classes, possible suspended license. You are also required to get sr22 insurance for 2 years which basically triples your normal insurance. Your 2nd penalties increased vastly, and your license almost surely suspended. 3rd is considered a felony. 




 I love Anthony Hamilton, smoothest voice of all time. Im a metal head, and im not ashamed but if my door is open when im playing AH one of my friends is closingt he door.  




 Snickers ice cream bar. Them things are literally a slice of heaven. 




 Hell yeah. I dont have a crank but like a push n pull Top machine. I roll my own from time to time limits the amount i smoke of marlboros. And has helped financially to.




I just find my throat gets a little irritated when i smoke too many home rolled and the tabacco just dont tatse the same. 




 What!!?! cigs in a can and booze at fast food, thats very different than my norm. Pretty cool though




Ill throw a crazy fact your way, i live in Louisiana where drunk driving is a major issue and a monster financial burden if you get one. Open container is also a serious driving crime. But we have alcholic daquiri shops that are drive thru only. In some cases you will be refused service if you are not in a car!! lol 




 You can look it up. You have to make sure the brand is the same when comparing though. Pointless to compare reg pall malls to 100 marlboro.



Like i said its not much but its there. The amount i spend on cigs, roughly $120 a month, i want the most i can get. 




 Is that a can in your link?




Crazy little differences in the simple things in life. Reminds me of Pulp fiction when travolta talikng bout Mcd. "Its called a royal with cheese"  




 There is a difference, it might not be much but its there. 




 It should be respected or disagreed with in a respectful manner. Its our right to have our own opinion so it should be treated with respect. A decent disscusion is totally plausible on the disagreement at hand but they are civilsed ways to go about that.




There are ways to say you're wrong but be civil about it. Being respectful is the best way to change their mind imo 




 No the cigarette is longer as well. 




 Right and you still havent made a case for that. "pretty much" every would be more than half, generally speaking, i just dont see how that case was made. When the link you presented has few in one universe a few in another and the rest not even touched on.




I did my fact checking as well but on the vega brother movie im taking facts from a recorded conversation rather then quotes. 




 When i say electrified guitar i mean the things that electrify them as well.Yea, guitars were around, but not widely used the way jimi or rock music used them. Jimi and rock acts alike were very brutal on their guitars unlike the common jazz musician or pop artist who barely moved. The design for this was vastly improved on, of course the quality got better with time.




Major differences in their guitars. Jimi could not find a left handed guitar so he had to flip his and chizzle the nut. Srv uses a flip guitar b/c of his dedication to jimi and this design was vastly improved on. He also had a poor tremelo system that helped keep his guitar out of tune. SRV had a much better quality guitar choice and tremelo system.




Amp designs were vastly improved on. Technology has made great improvements in blues. The tube amps design is not much different but the tube itself has vastly improved. So have the speakers they use, which makes a major difference. Also the way the music is recorded makes a world of difference as well, this also much improved by SRV time.





Jimi was not just blues SRV was. Jimis direction was vastly new and different and technology and an early death hindered this. Srv was jimis biggest fan. So yes you short both of their talents by putting one on bass but lets be honest if a choice was made Srv would be happliy pluck the bass so jimi could play.



 




 Couldnt disagree more. When darting though traffic one should be aware of all their surroundings, should not be in a coma at all. It also helps to dart though safely when their is a warning someone is coming to an unfore seen stop, which literally takes the least amount of energy possible to do. 




 Christmas is like a box chocolate, never know what you're going to get. 




 Your own link contradicts your case, it clearly says 2 universes not the same 




 Np, where do you live that sells cigs in different quanties? Curious 




 Bryce dallas howard, something sneakily sexy about that redhead 




 Richard Pryor, not a big fan of his movies. But no matter how many times i watch or listen to his stand up im floored and laughing like a mad man. 




 Amen 




 Using your blinker while driving 




 Well im unaware cigs are sold in different quantites. Where im from you can only buy a pack of 20 cigs, there are no other options. You can buy a carton of 10, 20 cig packs etc. My point is not quanity anyway its size so it would cost the same here for 20 or 30 cigs regardless of size.




There are some stores that still sell individual cigs but they are hard to find and usually overpriced 




 Havent seen that one yet.




I also think the jinx hbo documentary will stand the test of time, that shit was crazy and wildly entertaining 




 Its not like that in louisiana. Certain brands are the same cost regardless of size. But if your saving money that is quite reasonable 




 Maybe, but tell me that didnt make you laugh? When i hear sterotypes my mind goes to the venomous MD 




 Fair enough, will edit. 




 Thats ridiculous in of itself 




 Good quality bread, makes all the difference. 




 She asked for it.... 




 Mountain dew shrinks your dick 




 Did you also know foxs' chracter is Django von Shaft?  It had been disscussed by QT to do another 2 django movies. The sequel following django and his kin. The third being a remake of Shaft a direct desendant of Django 




 Wolf of wall street




Django Unchained 




 Usually if a certain brand is unavailable, a smoker will switch to a cheaper brand.  




 They cost the same as shorter cigs, its ridiculous not to buy the better deal imo 




 Most people find longer cigs will cause them to smoke more. I find with the insane prices i buy 100's and put em out half way. Treat it like 2 cigs, 40 a pack. So if the store doesnt have my brand and size ill go to another store, if i dont have the option ill change to a brand that offers that size.




My girlfriend buys marlboro 72s, the short short ones, she believes she smokes less by buying these. Which could be true but the way i look at it buy the 100s and get the most for your money and exercise will power.  




 The shining 




 Roger Waters, just a major dick. Music is top knotch though 




 North Korea



EDIT LOL downvoting cause North korea is too friendly? 




 The movie The prestige and the machine. I have a very cut and dry explaination that those who listen unbiased can make more sense out of it then the widely held explaination. Most people cannot overcome their bias though 




 I wouldnt say small, its an obvious difference. Even letting douglas get up differed from tysons attempt to get up and how they were handled.




There has been no proven motive but one could easily think of 100 motives the ref could have had to do such an act.




A great fight but i could never consider this the greatest b/c of the obvious difference in count. Im not a huge fan of tyson either but the tape dont lie, and it is hugely suspicous. 




 A partial answer to why didnt evolution.... is as the human evolved so did our head size. Early human women struggled to birth these rapidly growing heads. It was either lethal to the women and/or new born. Surely other factors as disease, and other unforeseen factors played a part but so did this 




 That 10 count for douglas compared to tysons' 10 count was highly suspicous and i loathe that fight because of it 




 No not at all be critical of anyone you want just be knowledgable on who you ar critical of, and yea im not saying dont post here im just saying its counter productive to post on subjects you dont know about when OP purpose is to get info on that subject, ie not a good move.




I still hold that wikipedia is not a great place to get your only knowledge of a subject 




 Yea it wasnt lsd, it was something like it cant remember though. He bought barrels of the stuff though, same shit Edgar allen poe was on i believe. But dont hold me to that. Im not sure if he used lsd per say but was into other substances for sure.




Alot of people say approach his works with caution b/c they will change you. I think thats non sense and its just part of his legend. One guy here said one of his works changed him for the better so maybe it is true. It changes you for the good or bad.




There was a great documentary on youtube about him. 




 Not a good move to post about subjects you know nothing about except a quick wikipedia search. If you dont know a better move to not post on an askreddit thread 




 I was already on the fence but when i watched Sam harris for the first time i was shocked these arguments could be made intelligently sound. I pretty much had lost faith but was holding on due to social pressure. Harris help confirm my struggles were not crazy. Mostly the debate of harris and Wlc. Most people say Wlc won or was more convincing but i honestly dont see how you come to that conclusion reasonably.



Dawkins and the infamous Hitchens have some strong debates. Watch hitch debate the Catholic Church, where they take votes before and after the debate on the topic. The results are quite powerful 




 Not a great move to base your knowledge off of wikipedia 




 So did i, according to actual footage of QT talking, not some quote, this was never a possibility. 




 At the time the church was much less challenged and those that did so were socially crushed. His bad image has seemingly lasted, and i agree its a bit silly. He wrote some great books, even when possesed, very talented writer. Great works on practical magic that delves into black magic and summons, his life work really.




I cant remember specifics but almost certainly cocaine and lsd trippy kind of substances.




Also, i think comments have been deleted he didnt form the church of satan. Its founding almost certainly used some of his works but he didnt consider himself a satanist at all. And the church was founded after his death. From what i understand in his pursuit of magic, he discovered it was plausible to summon Satan. And if the pain stakingly detail oriented summon was performed properly, Satan would come forth and annoit the with god-like powers. So his pursuit of this consumed him, he wanted the powers as opposed to being a rebel of the Church. 




 Hendrix played at a time when electrified guitars were brand new. SRV had a big advantage in quality of guitars, amps, and even material to learn from. All of these things played a factor in being cleaner, etc.




SRV is mostly a famous Hendrix fanactic, he had some hit songs, but no where near the influential ground breaking material hendrix released. SRV would have handed hendrix the guitar, of much better quality than he was used too, with a floyd rose,keep it in tune, gladly picked up a bass and sat there to get schooled first hand, and loved every second of it.



EDIT, SRV was a bit faster but imo he played the same licks constantly so of course he mastered them. Hendrix was way ahead in chords and phrasing, also just another level creativity. With that said i love SRV, simply great but in this case SRV wouldnt bite the hand who feed him, imo. 




 What does that have to do with Crowely founding the church?  In that same website C.O.S., the article "was aleister crowely a satanist", it clearly says he was not and the C.O.S. was founded after his death, same site. 




 Producing as much as possible was a epic task as we evolved. Early human women struggled in birth because of a rapidly growing human head, with no aid. Still not an easy task today. This to answer on population question.




Yes like "dumfuker" said women are just as "horny", its just socially frowned on for women to be as bold as men on the subject. 




 Church of satan was founded after his death 




 Crowely was a satanist of sorts, a rebel if you will and participated in black magic. He endlessly tried to summon the devil. One of his books was claimed by crowely to have been wriiten by a demon he summoned that possesed him, The book of law. He was also assumed to have done sacrifices, crazy orgies, and did massive amounts of drugs requiring his cult to do the same.



He is wrapped up in things people tend to look down on, so they shun him. I find his writing and stories fasinating.



Little known fact, Jimmy page was an avid fan. Led zeppelin even recorded their most famous album in crowelys former mansion. It has been rumored the many tragedies that struck the band after their sessions were from being cursed by Crowelys lingering previously summoned evils there. Including a few serious accidents and two deaths 




 Yea i think its unlikely given the fact he was wrongfully imprisoned and help find the killer but possible. 




 This is a great thought. 




 If anybody gonna play bass would have been srv.... 




 Bonham on drums



Phil leynot on bass/vocals




Allen collins on guitar




Lonesome dave on guitar/vocals




 




 Watch the pulp fiction 15year cast and crew renuion. Hear what Qt actually says about that movie, not relying solely on a quote. 




 Yea ive seen leo and quentin confirm this.   




Another fact like that, Jonah hill really gets knocked out in the Wolf of wall street. After 30 something takes of faking it, Scorcese insisted they do a real take. 




 Thats some major strecthing with the kill bill movies, where is the connection between dusk? The fact about the bear jew was cool though. It still leaves a few of his movies untouched. 




Even by this article, there would be more than one universe, it clearly says two universes. Its quite a strecth to get there btw, but how you get the "same"  universe for all his movies is beyond me. 




 15th anniversary cast and crew of pulp fiction, video on youtube.



Interviewer "was there gonna be a vega brothers movie?"


Tarantino "They both die in the movie so...."



Cast member " would have been a prequel."




Tarantino shrugs it off continuing on to next question.




There might have been a little talk like hey wouldnt it have been cool to do....., but according to what i gather this was not a serious scenario. It doesnt sound like it was by your comments either. There were rumors but not because QT was actually working on it.  




 I was setting up the premise samjam 




 Ive watched everyone of his movies i dont see that at all. His first two movies were very similar because he had exact same crew. Both had extremely small budgets. 




EDIT, lol how this gets downvoted?? Some of his movies have similar character names but most are clearly not in the same universe 




 Not true 




 Yea i heard this somewhere, i find little known facts like this fascinating. 




 The interview i just watched pretty much implied Tarantino never had any plans to do this. I would totally have watched that movie though.
