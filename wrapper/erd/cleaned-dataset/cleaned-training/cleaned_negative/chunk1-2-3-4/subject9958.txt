I read with interest [your letter](http://www.ea.com/news/we-can-do-better?ClickID=dcsyz0xhwthrxxxnbm22hhbok2ktrrkt2yxk) to the gaming community regarding the perceptions your customers and the gaming community have of Electronic Arts (EA).  I can understand some of your frustration as indeed some of the criticism is unfair, some unfounded and some overblown.  It is true being bigger, as you implied, means you catch more flak.

I am one of your customers but not a particularly important one.  Merely one drop in a very large bucket.  Nor am I "the voice of the community" or speaking for anyone but myself.  Nevertheless I wanted to address some points you made in your letter and I feel fairly certain many others are thinking the same things (or near enough).  Hubris on my part?  Maybe but it is in earnest.  

I get why being voted "Worst Company in America" would bug you.  It should bug you.  Not because you actually are the "Worst Company in America" but because enough people would think it to vote that way.  This should be telling you/EA something and that it is something to think about rather than dismiss as a bunch of juvenile cranks.

The trick is to figure how the people voting are defining "worst".  Is it "most evil company that destroys ecosystems" or can you think of it as "who treats their customers poorly and delivers a sub-par product while trying to extract the most money they can from their customers"?  Make no mistake I have no love for the oil companies but as a customer they do deliver the product I expect with little hassle.  EA on the other hand seems to be like a gold digger eyeing a prospect to figure how much he/she can be squeezed for.

To be clear, I completely understand EA is a business and they are in this game (pun intended) to make money.  If you do not make money you will be out of business...simple as that.  Absolutely nothing at all wrong with trying to turn a profit (no business would exist if it didn't...learned that in Econ-101).

The issue arises in how you go about making that money.  I will not sit here and tell you the right way to do that (actually I started doing that, wrote several paragraphs and deleted them...email me if you want them).  I will, however, point out some clear misses and apparent blind spots from your letter.  I can guarantee you that this is not just my opinion.  Your corpo/PR approved/sanitized speech has only [incensed people further](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1bqz6u/peter_moore_we_can_do_better/) (hence this letter).

- You did not support SOPA but [did not oppose it either](http://www.joystiq.com/2012/01/17/ea-explains-lack-of-sopa-stance/).  Further, you did support the Entertainment Software Association which did support SOPA.  Distancing yourself from that is dubious.  It is like pretending you have no political stance while sending money to...I won't Godwinize this letter so will leave it at that (did I just pull off a stealth Godwinization?).

- Your wonderment at the Mass Effect fiasco shows a lack of understanding about what it was the fans were mad about.  Watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6M0Cf864P7E).  It should clear things up.

- Your fumble of the SimCity launch could have/should have been seen miles away.  I'm sure you had pre-sales numbers so had good reason to know *most* of those people would be jumping your servers in the first few hours.  How can you miss that?  Is giving away 900,000 games cheaper than buying a few more servers?  (Now I think about it I can see that it might have been.  Will need to get my tinfoil hat to ponder that one some more.)

- SimCity always online bit IS a DRM scheme.  It may be other things too but I am sure the folks at EA did not miss that it manages to be DRM because I am (almost) certain they are not stoopid.  That said the DRM aspects may have been icing on the cake.  The online bit for SimCity looks like a good way to get micro-transactions going for the SimCity franchise.  Bottom line is there is NO reason SimCity ever needed an online aspect.  It was not, has never been, that kind of game and has never been a big request for players.  Pretty sure the internet has been telling EA/Maxis that from the very first time they learned of it.  EA/Maxis did it anyway cuz you know...to hell with what the customer wants.

- 45 million registered users is not a meaningful comparison to Steam.  I can personally say I have four games on Origin and 100 (I checked) on Steam.  I log in to Steam several times a week.  I go months without logging in to Origin.  I am willing to bet, indeed I will bet you, Steam blows your doors off in this and will continue to do so.

- About the Madden cover thing...in any large enough group you will have some cranks and weirdos.  I have worked for multi-national companies before and seen some of the complaints that come in and bizarre barely covers it.  Ignore them.  Worry when so many people dislike your company you start winning contests about being the most hated company in the US.

- As for the LGBT stance kudos to you.  You will be on the right side of history and, frankly, it is a smart business decision for you.  Bonus it is also the ethical and the morally correct decision.  Obviously it is a polarizing issue and you cannot keep both sides happy at the same time.  Not being snarky or kidding at all about this...good on you and EA for this position.  

It is encouraging to see you saying EA wants to do better and I really hope EA follows through on that.  You have excellent examples out there such as Steam (perhaps your nemesis but you would be foolish to not figure out what they are doing right) and/or like the folks at CD Projekt RED (to name two).  Both are doing smashingly well with incredible consumer loyalty doing almost exactly the opposite (in many respects) of what EA does.

I used to like EA.  I want to like EA.  You need to decide whether you want to be [Walmart or Costco](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/11/26/why-can-t-walmart-be-more-like-costco.html) in this.

Sincerely,

 I was reading the article [It's Diablo 3 All Over Again with the SimCity 5 Launch](http://www.tomshardware.com/news/SimCity-Diablo-DRM-PC-Gaming-Always-Connected,21385.html) and it occurred to me that for all the gnashing of teeth over these things our pain doesn't matter.

For all the bitching and moaning gamers can produce it is of no matter.  There is ONE measure these companies care about...sales.  

The article I linked above compares Sim City 5 to Diablo-3.  As bad as Diablo-3 turned out to be here are the sales results:

Diablo 3 increased its sales by 2 million from the Q3 of 2012 and that makes Diablo 3 the #1 best-selling PC game at retail for the calendar year 2012 in North America and Europe. ([CITE](http://gamerexp.com/diablo-3-passes-12-million-sales-world-of-warcraft-lost-subscriptions))

In short, all this bitching and moaning is meaningless.  As long as EA can nab best selling games you can bitch all you want.  I guarantee they do not give a shit if they can sell 12 million copies.
 





















































































































































































































































































































 Frustrated by a lack of political power and fed up with blindly donating to politicians who consistently vote against the industry's interests, a handful of leaders are determined to shake things up.

Are they serious?  What planet are they living on?

Whoops...not sure why that didn't link to the article.  Here is the link:

 This has always confused me.

Imagine I step off the ISS into space and I want to de-orbit and fall back to earth.  When I step off the station I will remain in orbit next to the space station.  To get back to earth do I need to speed up or slow down?

My confusion stems from the following:

The further away from earth you are the slower you go to stay in a stable orbit.  So, if I slowed down would I move into a higher orbit?  To get back to earth do I need to speed up?
 


































 Not sure if my Vanguard guy should focus more on Aim or Strength.  He is tank specced and has a few melee based attacks as well as ranged attacks.  For the most part the ranged attacks are not all that strong and more damage seems possible with the melee stuff (such as Stock Strike).

Ideas?  Opinions?
 














 I am level-17 Vanguard still tooling around Coruscant.

I have pimped my character about as much as I think he can be pimped on this planet.  Using commendations he has a very nice blaster rifle (complete with mods) and his armor is about as good as it will get for the next few levels (he has an Aim of over 200).

Anyway, when I am fighting mobs my blaster rifle feels like a squirt gun.  I am laying in shooting non-stop and their damage bar ever-so-slowly goes down.  Then my companion (Adric-dude) pops one shot with his autocannon and half their health bar vanishes.

Granted the blaster rifle is not meant to be as powerful as the heavy guns but geez...feels more like I am whipping them with a wet noodle.

My special attacks do damage fine and are what carry me through but I just figured the second most powerful set of guns in the game would have a bit more oomph to them.

Any ideas on what I am missing or is this just how it is? 




 Seems to me it is not in their interest.

If SOPA passes people registering websites would go way down.  People hosting on their site would go way down.  SOPA simply puts far to much liability on a website operator for anyone to be casual about it and that would reduce the number of people starting websites.

So, forgetting for a moment that SOPA sucks and should be opposed period where is GoDaddy's self-interest in supporting this?

As near as I can tell it would only hurt their business.  Self-interest, if doing the right thing is too hard for them, should see them oppose this anyway.

 




 Say we have an infinite series of random numbers such as:

68432010267983002180002687964157862...(goes on forever)

Is there a chance that if you chose some series of numbers, say 1234567890987654321 or 00000000000000000000, will not occur?

If so how big does the series have to be before we could expect a chance of not finding a given string?  That is, it seems silly to think we would never see 35 or 91 or 47 to never appear.  As we get longer the chances for a given series to appear diminish but they never reach zero.
 









 I know the quick answer to this is "no".  I realize Quantum Mechanics has the electron sorta smeared out and assigns probabilities to its location.

That said, does the electron actually have a specific location at any given point in time and the problem is merely our inability to pinpoint it (Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle)?  Or is the electron, in reality, really smeared out?

Also, I know the Bohr Model of an atom is not correct (i.e. electrons orbit akin to planets) but if that is incorrect is the electron orbiting in any fashion or is it blinking (or jumping for lack of better words) from place to place?
 







































 I think this has been mentioned before but it bears repeating since I have seen numerous people pointing this out lately.

This is an internet message board.  Not AP English class.  People will make mistakes when typing messages.  Happens.  Stop correcting every little error and instead focus on the gist of the post.  

Mind you, I am all for proper grammar and I think anyone wanting to make a serious point is well served if they pay attention to their grammar.  Mistakes only detract from what you are trying to get across.

Still, mistakes happen and the worst editor in the world is the person who wrote what is being edited (loosely speaking).

There are some caveats to this (not meant to be an authoritative list as I am sure there are other exceptions to be found):

1)  You are correcting someone who is correcting someone else's grammar.

2)  The misspelling changes the post in a way that makes it unintentionally humorous (worth making note of that).

3)  The grammar is so atrocious as to be nearly unreadable.

Bottom line is to use common sense.  Would you want the topic of discussion in a post you made be your use of "there" instead of "their" when it has nothing to do with anything you were writing about?

Try [this bit by Stephen Fry](http://vimeo.com/15412319) if you want the point put more eloquently than I ever could.

EDIT:  To anyone who loves language I *highly* recommend the Stephen Fry bit I linked.  The guy is brilliant.

 





























 An Englishman, Irishman and Scotsman walk into a bar and order a pint.

They look at their beer and notice there is a fly stuck in the foam of each one.

The Englishman, showing some disgust, grabs a spoon and fishes the fly out.

The Scotsman casually flicks the fly out of the foam with his fingers.

The Irishman grabs the fly and yells, "Spit it out ya bastard!"
 
































































 From the linked article:

S P, a unit of McGraw Hill Financial Inc, has said statements about the integrity of its ratings are "puffery" that cannot be a basis for the fraud lawsuit, filed on February 4 by the U.S. Department of Justice.

"Puffery" is a legal term amounting to [promotional statements and claims that express subjective rather than objective views, which no "reasonable person" would take literally.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puffery)

That has to be one of the most fatuous statements I have heard in a long time.  They SOLD their ratings not on the basis of "puffery" but clearly as intended to be factual assessments of the given securities they were rating.

Seems a court got this right this time.
 









 The main purpose of the One Ring was to dominate the will of the users of the other nine rings.

Men succumbed almost instantly to this.  The Elves figured out what was up with their rings and took them off before they could be used against them and I forget what the Dwarves did with their rings.

That said only Sauron could wield that power.  If others used the ring it came to dominate them and would have them seek out Sauron to return the ring to Sauron (the ring was imbued with Sauron's spirit to an extent).
 




 Richard Feynman (great scientist) explains this well: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tuxLY94LXw

Short version is it gets front/back reversed and not right/left. 




 There is no limit to the amount of data they could collect in principle.

The problem lies in cost and how big the unit is to be able to hold all that additional information and still remain as resilient as they are.

Over the years more and more data has been added to the black box so they record more than they once did.  Whether there are still some things they'd like to record that they don't or they feel this is enough to determine what happened I do not know.
 




 You should do something to make your your first sentence that is a quote more obvious it is a quote.  I suspect a lot of your downvotes are because people think you are the one espousing that notion (on a first quick read I almost hit the downvote button till a second check I realized you were quoting the article).

*Italicize it* or use the quote function:

E.G. this thing

Or not as you like.  Just saying.  Carry on.

 483 comments and only one original comment (all the rest are responses to that one top comment as of this writing).  

Must be some kind of record.  

I guess barring accidental ass bleaching which is apparently rare no one wants to admit to doing it on purpose.  That or Redditors are not a target market for ass bleaching.
 




 This a hundred times.

The ending and the [look on their faces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage v=3JTH5VPAT4Y#t=166) is some of the best move making ever. 




  Germany had two fronts. Their ability to manufacture was easily bombed.

Actually German production [increased year-to-year](http://chris-intel-corner.blogspot.com/2013/05/wwii-myths-german-war-economy-was.html) throughout WWII despite the bombings.
 




 Amen brother (or sister as the case may be).

You can eat a hundred steaks from a local supermarket and they'll be fine...good even.

Then you have a steak that is top notch.  The cow was raised well, the butcher knew their stuff and the chef knew how to make the best of that and you have something truly remarkable.

I've only had a few like that in my life (tends to be very expensive) but seriously...WOW!

Put it this way...I have had hundreds of steaks in my life.  I still remember those few distinctly many years later.
 




 There are three grades of beef:

- Prime
- Choice
- Select

Prime is of course best and also expensive.  Choice is still very good and reasonably priced.  Select is cheapest and it shows.  For the most part steer clear of "Select" cuts.  By eye you can generally distinguish the cuts by the [amount of marbling](http://www.kansascitymamas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/beef-grades.png) they have (more marbling = good).

----

Try to understand the main parts of the cow and where a given cut comes from.  There is a lot of fiddly detail that can be learned but that would be class 301 and 401.  For 201 just try and remember this image: http://0.tqn.com/d/culinaryarts/1/0/i/Y/-/-/US_Beef_cuts.jpg

Note that in general the further away you are from the horn and the hoof the more tender the meat is (muscles that work more like leg muscles are tougher).  As such the tenderloin is the most tender cut.

This is not to say tougher cuts are bad...far from it.  They just need to be cooked a bit differently and/or longer for a desirable result.  That said in general the more tender cuts tend to be more expensive (doubtless there are exceptions).

----
Avoid the Round part of the cow.  I am sure there are some recipes that make good use of it but I cannot think of one off the top of my head and would have to look it up.

That said the round is cheap...probably the cheapest part of the cow so if you are on a serious budget it can be a consideration.  You'll just have to work harder to make something good of it.

----

When buying meat make sure the specific part is listed.  If you buy "stew meat" and other generic sounding bits it is usually from the round and other undesirable cuts they are hard pressed to sell otherwise.  

So, for instance, when buying hamburger get ground chuck and not just "hamburger" which will probably be the round (ground sirloin works too but ground chuck is more usual).

----

Understand how different cuts cook.  A NY Strip is great for grilling.  A brisket needs a long, slow cook. Bigger cuts may need to be braised.  The more connective tissue and what not the longer you need to cook it.

----

Cheaper cuts are not necessarily "worse".  The tenderloin is probably the most expensive cut but it has little flavor (very lean...it is prized for being tender...the chef needs to add flavor).  A brisket is a cheaper cut but can be freaking awesome when cooked properly.

Again, just stay away from the round (in most cases). ;)
 




 Must be an age thing.  I recognized all of it.  Thing is you rarely see a chateaubriand or even a t-bone on a menu anymore (restaurants figured there is more money in selling a filet and a NY Strip than a t-bone I think).

It was only a couple weeks ago at a specialized butcher that I saw the first tomahawk cut in ages...I was a kid last time I saw that in the meat case.

Hangar steak is indeed making a comeback.  Had not seen it in ages and am now seeing more of it very recently.  I think that is because beef prices are way up and it is a relatively cheap cut so they can offer a steak on the menu and retain a profit margin and not scare customers.

Ribeyes and the rest have been around forever.
 



















 I bought a Samsung 840 Pro 512GB SSD.  My current system has two drives running in Raid-0 for a total of 250GB (I know but it has served me very well for years).

My question is when I install the new SSD should I leave the current drives in and migrate or unplug the old drives, setup the new drive and do a fresh install of windows and all that?

Either is doable.  Of course migrating would be simpler overall.  I do not know if there are issues getting trim to run via this method though.

Opinions?  
 










































































 Where is everyone?  I figured the Wrigleyville area to be a hotbed of Reddit activity!
 





































































 You can see a description of the recent uproar [here](https://tv.yahoo.com/news/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-vogue-cover-backlash-anna-193400697.html).

While I, personally, am no fan of West or Kardashian and view them both as symbols of what is (at least partly) wrong with this country I am not understanding why there is an uproar over their appearance on the cover of Vogue.

It is my understanding Vogue is a fashion magazine.  West and Kardashian are certainly fashionable and attractive (physically).  Since when is Vogue meant to be socially minded or politically active?  Even if readers think they should be how can these two be so controversial *especially* considering their success?  I thought the sorts of people who read Vogue are the sorts of people who are [Keeping up with the Kardashians](http://www.eonline.com/shows/kardashians).

 I have been looking to buy a [Sony KDL-55W900A](http://www.amazon.com/Sony-KDL-55W900A-55-Inch-240Hz-Internet/dp/B00AWKBZ0M/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics ie=UTF8 qid=1377791638 sr=1-1 keywords=kdl-55w900a).  Unfortunately it really is a bit big for the space I want it in.  Doable but would rather have a 46" set.

Unfortunately Sony does not sell the same model in the US in a 46" version.  Their 46" one is a step down in terms of the technology inside.

I was surprised to find that Sony does actually make a 46" version of that set and sell it in [Asia](http://www.sony-asia.com/product/kdl-46w900a) and [Australia](http://www.sony.com.au/product/kdl-46w900a). 

I would MUCH rather have the 46" set and am puzzled why Sony would not sell it in the US but that seems to be the case.

So my question to those here is are there any reasons to *not* buy the TV from overseas and have it shipped?  Things like the menus are in a foreign language and can't be changed (not really a problem from Australia though) or the TV has some kind of regional locking or stuff like NTSC vs PAL from the old days or anything else?

Or do HDTVs work the same everywhere?

 So...looking to revisit Borderlands 2 and maybe get some DLC Steam tells me there is [$110 dollars](http://i.imgur.com/LSpGzoc.png) worth to be had.  Pretty sure there is overlap here and seems kinda shitty Steam would lay out a $110 pricetag but maybe I am wrong.

 Hell...the Civil War wasn't over till 1865 so it is hard to make that accusation before that time.
 




  For starters, I think there are some mental health problems associated with the gay condition. Not that being gay is a mental health problem, but that gays tend to have mental health problems.

No they don't.  At least they do not have mental health problems out of proportion to any other group.  Put another way homosexual people can experience the myriad of psychological disorders the same as any other group but no more and no less.  It is possible things like depression are induced because being oppressed is not fun and would make anyone depressed.

The American Psychiatric Association (APA) removed homosexuality from its official Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) in 1973.  Further changes were made in the 80's and there is no longer any diagnosis professionally recognized as a disorder because someone is a homosexual.

"Males do not represent two discrete populations, heterosexual and homosexual. The world is not to be divided into sheep and goats. It is a fundamental of taxonomy that nature rarely deals with discrete categories... The living world is a continuum in each and every one of its aspects." *(Kinsey, et al. 1948 Sexual Behavior in the Human Male (1948), p. 639)*.  




 The movie Darkstar. A seriously bad (but in a great way) movie from 1974 (I think). John Carpenter directed it.

  The two major things to avoid with a nuclear reactor are a runaway reaction and a meltdown of the core.

I thought a runaway reaction is a meltdown (as the reaction gets out of control the core heats up and the whole thing melts)?
 




 Yeah...it talks a little about it in the article:

The BBC understands that Google does not search Gmail accounts for other forms of illegal activity, such as pirated content or hate speech.
 




 The part where you cannot deny a woman's right to an abortion.

Granted that is a "right" that was read into the constitution under the "penumbras and emanations" which deemed a right to privacy to exist in the constitution despite it not being explicitly mentioned.  From this right the SCOTUS ruled that a woman cannot be restricted from obtaining an abortion by the state.

You can of course argue that the SCOTUS reasoning in Roe v. Wade is wrong but it remains the law of the land (well...Casey has supplanted Roe and weakened it but a woman still has a right to an abortion).

If the state passes a law that regulates clinics saying, "All doctors must have X" then makes it impossible to get "X" then the state is impermissibly trodding on woman's rights here.  




  You really don't need to read the email's content to filter spam.

I am almost religious about marking spam as spam in my email client and blocking senders of spam in my client and I still get a lot getting through and a lot shunted to my spam folder.

Spammers are well aware of the easy things you can do to block them and are waaay ahead of you on that. 




  This was Google deciding someone is guilty and they should hand him over to the police.

No.  This is Google suspecting a crime may have been committed and handing the evidence over to the police.  The police then decide if there is enough to go on and, if so, arrest the man.  A court will decide if he is guilty or not.

And as noted in the story **all** US companies are legally required to report suspected child abuse.  So, if Google is scanning the emails and is able to discern a suspected child abuser they have no choice but to make the authorities aware of it. 




 Looks great.  I am using now instead of my old one.

The only request that I'd have for the app is if the time till the next train/bus arriving at a stop was displayed on the "Favorite Routes" page.  Not sure if you can squeeze that in or not but would be nice to see at a glance.
 




  I'd like an app that tries to emulate the "should I walk/transfer here or here" i do based off of looking at where my present stuff is and what would be where I ended up going, and sometimes the congestion of the trains ahead or traffic in case of bus.

I think Google Maps will route the ideal route for the time and conditions including transfers using mass transit.
 




 You can never really get 100% of the money going to the cause.  Someone needs to pay for the lights and the office space and the receptionist and the postage and whatnot.

Most good charities will be able to tell you what percentage of each dollar goes to the cause the charity is supporting. 25% for overhead is pretty good (75% to the cause).
 














 I've always looked at someone laying hands on you as a green light to respond.

I assume you mean "respond" in this case to mean "retaliate".

I can come up with dozens of variants of "laying hands on you" off the top of my head of "laying hands on you" that would suggest retaliation goes too far.

I think you need to be more explicit.   




 Kaiser Wilhelm II was a moron.  In a world where things make sense he *might* have managed a government spot as the city dog catcher.

Put the likes of Bismarck back in control of things and it'd be a different matter.

 




 They would NOT cover this.

This device would not necessarily prevent conception from occurring.  Hobby Lobby would consider the resultant failed pregnancy an abortion and hence would oppose it.

Basically it is The Pill (which Hobby Lobby obviously opposes) in a time release electronically controlled dispenser.

 




 The US Constitution says the president may be impeached for "high crimes and misdemeanors".

Thing is there is no definition of what that is exactly.

As a result congress can impeach and convict a president for pretty much any reason at all.  There is no appeals process to it.  If congress throws the president out because they do not like his tie they can do so and there is nothing to stop them except for public opinion.

While that may seem terribly broken and not fair people need to remember that despite the legal language surrounding it impeachment is a purely political endeavor.  Basically, as representatives of the people, Congress is firing the president from his job...that's all it amounts to in the end.

That said there is no way they will get president Obama out of office this way.  They may succeed in impeaching him (like Clinton was) but they will never get a conviction from the Senate and they know it.  This is nothing more than political grandstanding on the republicans' part.

EDIT to add:  Thinking on it more the republicans are probably laying the groundwork and hoping to take the senate in November in which case they could proceed with impeachment and expect to succeed.

 




 One of the panel mentioned how the woman is the victim.

Seems to me if you initiate a physical assault on someone you are no longer a victim.

That said there is proportion in all things.  If the woman slaps you and your ego is more injured than your face that does not grant you permission to punch her lights out.
 




 While I cannot speak for the individuals on that panel (I do not know who they are) they are speaking at a Heritage Foundation event which make them among the war monger faction.  The Heritage Foundation was a big supporter of the invasion of Iraq.

The woman speaking decries the millions killed despite most people being peace loving which seems to imply it is worthless to be peace loving. 

Seems to me her rant is a cautionary tale about keeping an eye on people exactly like her who would lead you to war over the most meager of provocations.  Four dead in Benghazi?  Sad and tragic to be sure but does it merit that whole panel?  Four people (or more) are shot per day (NOT every day) in Chicago with some regularity.  How about they convene a panel to solve that problem?  Oh yeah...there is no money in that.
 




 It really depends on the breed.  Many lap dogs have a variety of issues but the working breeds are often in great shape (they have to be) and they excel at particular tasks.

The trick is to find a reputable breeder.  In the US there are far too many puppy mills which do not give a shit about the quality of the animals they produce.  In some cases this can ruin an entire breed (this happened to the German Shepherd Dog which now has serious health problems in the US...the armed forces and police go to East Europe to get their dogs instead of buying from the US).

If responsibly bred with a care to the gene lines there is no reason you cannot get a healthy pure breed dog.  Such a dog is usually quite expensive though.  A mutt from the local pound can be a stellar family pet and costs very little.  Unless you have a real need or jones for a particular breed a dog from the pound is the way to go 99% of the time.
 




  From a retail perspective, they're much harder to shoplift.

People are also less likely to return the product assuming that if it can't be repackaged in what they bought it in that it cannot be returned.

 




  Why do some people think Democrats are so smart, have you seen their voter base? There's just as many republicans that are not scientific as their are democrats, so generalizing that republicans don't agree with science is in fact not science itself.

Individuals may espouse some stupid ideas but the republicans are actively opposing scientific consensus from scientists.  More, it is not just an occasional crackpot here and there but has taken center stage in republican policy.

For instance:

- The Texas Republican Party has as part of their official party platform that governments at all levels should ["ignore any plea for money to fund global climate change or 'climate justice' initiatives."](http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2014/06/05/3445339/texas-gop-2014-platform-climate-change/)

- ["A new law in North Carolina will ban the state from basing coastal policies on the latest scientific predictions of how much the sea level will rise..."](http://abcnews.go.com/US/north-carolina-bans-latest-science-rising-sea-level/story?id=16913782)

- All that stuff I was taught about evolution and embryology and the Big Bang Theory, all that is lies straight from the pit of Hell. And its lies to try to keep me and all the folks who were taught that from understanding that they need a savior.

And...

- I dont believe that the Earths but about 9,000 years old. I believe it was created in six days as we know them. Thats what the Bible says. ~Paul Broun (he's a doctor and was on the House Science Committee)

-  "If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down [pregnancy]." ~Todd Akin

And so it goes with them. 




 Chicagoan here too (whole life minus college time).

Never heard this before in my life and I hear the siren go off every first Tuesday of the month at 10a from my office in the Loop.

 Cover your nuts before you say that.  You're about to get hurt...badly. 









  It costs more money to kill them though, since we allow for an extended appeals process to make as sure as possible we are killing only the guilty.

It is not more expensive because of the appeals process.  It adds to the cost to be sure but the cost would be more even without the appeals process (see my other reply to /u/ImAGhostOooooo). 




 It costs substantially more to put a person on death row and execute them than it does to imprison them for life.  This point isn't even argued by death penalty advocates.

How expensive is the death penalty? Just over a year ago, Fox News issued this alarming statement:

Every time a killer is sentenced to die, a school closes.

Dramatic, sure. But some claim that the data backs up these assertions.

While the actual execution costs taxpayers fairly little (the drugs used in Texas run a mere $83), the costs associated with death penalty trials and the resulting incarceration are disproportionately higher.

Citing Richard C. Dieter of the Death Penalty Information Center, Fox reported that studies have uniformly and conservatively shown that a death-penalty trial costs $1 million more than one in which prosecutors seek life without parole.

A Urban Institute study (downloads as a pdf) found that [i]n Maryland death penalty cases cost 3 times more than non-death penalty cases, or $3 million for a single case while a 2004 Report from Tennessee Comptroller of the Treasury Office of Research that claimed [i]n Tennessee, death penalty trials cost an average of 48% more than the average cost of trials in which prosecutors seek life imprisonment.

snip

I assumed that this was because of all of the post-trial finagling that goes on. I was wrong. After reviewing data from state reports, Amnesty International concluded that the greatest costs associated with the death penalty occur prior to and during trial, not in post-conviction proceedings. Even if all post-conviction proceedings (appeals) were abolished, the death penalty would still be more expensive than alternative sentences.

 I have DirecTV and I have never had anything but except exceptional service.

I do not work for them, I do not own stock in them and have no family reliant on them.  I truly think they are awesome.  I say this as a former Comcast customer (among a few others over the years).  I have come to loathe the cable companies.  That is not hyperbole.

That said I have never tried to cancel my sub and perhaps that is different.

What's the catch?  They are FUCKING EXPENSIVE!  I mean seriously expensive.  I spend $150/month and not even that gets me all the channels (most but not all and I had the best package then they added an even more package and that just pissed me off).

So why do I stay with them?  Awesome service.  

My picture almost never goes out except in an occasional powerful storm (which cable suffers from too since their feeds are from satellite).  Cable was far, far worse.  My picture is better than it ever has been with cable.

The equipment is fisrt rate and incredibly capable.  I can record six shows at the same time off of one input feed.  That box holds dozens of hours of content and it can be watched on any TV in the house with ease.  

Their on-air menu system is freaking light years ahead of cable.  Better looking by a mile and far, far more user friendly.

Customer service *for me* has been nothing short of stellar.  I do not think I have ever waited more than 5 minutes for a rep and the reps have always fixed everything remotely within minutes with no need for a repairman to come out.  When I have complained about a charge (very, very rarely) they just wipe it off my account.

I called them on a Friday about maybe upgrading my system and they gave me all the top notch DVR shit at no cost but also came out the next day (Saturday) to install it all (work on the roof on the dish as well as the new DVR) and hook-up the whole house with the new system (very cool...you can watch any show in any room DVR).  Cost of the install?  $0.00 for about four hours of work (I tipped him but that may have been weird...just felt like he deserved something extra).

Again, DirecTV is expensive as all hell and I have been considering unplugging from them because of it.  Only thing stopping me are some particular circumstances with my living arrangement.  If AT T buys them (I fucking hate AT T although they are not even the worst) that may be enough for me to go.

I am not denying the experience of the OP.  Maybe their customer service turns to shit when you tell them you want to stop service.  For my money if you are going to have any service DirecTV is the best.  You'll pay for it through the nose though. 




  No one missed that point, not a single person, it's in your imagination that we don't already know that.

You cannot say what people do or do not know.

What we can say is people are trying to discredit the whole OP because it is cherry picking its numbers.  

And they're right about that.  The OP did cherry pick.

However, the complaint did not note the subtext which is the workforce for solar is on par with coal currently and well placed to sail ahead of coal in the future.  

If "not a single person" was fooled it is odd to neglect to mention it if only to be fair and for completeness sake.

This has clear policy and political ramifications and so the commentary I was responding to can only be seen as intentionally deceptive and/or pedantic.  In short it was as guilty of misinformation as what it was railing against since it skewed perception of what is happening.

  I think you'll find that coal still employs far more people if you use the same definition.

It is hard to do an apples-to-apples comparison but the numbers in the article are skewed:

There are, however, two other relevant data series. One, from the Energy Information Administration, shows 91,611 coal-mining workers in 2011, a 6.3 percent increase from the year before. A third data set, the most inclusive, maintained by the Mine Health and Safety Administration, reports 143,437 coal-mining employees in 2011 and estimates there were 137,361 in 2012.  According to the National Mining Association, which published its own report on mining jobs in 2010, the MHSA data is the most inclusive and best reflects the total number of coal jobs of all the government data sets. Why? It surveys the mines themselves, not the companies, meaning it can capture contract workers who are not necessarily employed by the company that owns or operates the mine.

In any case, there isnt a great apples-to-apples comparison for coal and solar jobs. If we use the most generous survey of solar jobs and the rough midpoint of government surveys of coal jobs, the two seem to be roughly comparable. [SOURCE](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/05/06/reports-say-there-are-more-solar-workers-than-coal-miners-in-the-u-s.html)

But for all the poo-pooing some here want to do because the numbers in the OP are skewed miss the bigger point.  Solar jobs are increasing and coal jobs are stagnant or decreasing.  This trend looks like it will keep going for the foreseeable future too.

This then has policy implications.  If the goal of government is to "promote" jobs then supporting the coal industry is a losing proposition.  Their job growth is medicore to stagnant to negative (depending who you read and how you look at it).  Solar clearly is currently about even overall with coal workers in terms of people employed and looks to keep growing.

In short the money committed to Wall Street bailouts alone since the 2008 crisis could fund all social welfare programs in the US for decades or more (including Social Security and Medicare).

This doesn't even touch other subsidies corporations have enjoyed for decades such as subsidies to the oil and coal industries.

 - Black carbon (BC) is the most strongly light-absorbing component of particulate matter (PM), and is formed by the incomplete combustion of
fossil fuels, biofuels, and biomass.

- BC contributes to the adverse impacts on human health, cosystems, and visibility associated with PM 2.5

- BC influences climate by: 1) directly absorbing light, 2) reducing the reflectivity (albedo) of snow and ice through deposition, and 3)
interacting with clouds. 

- BCs short atmospheric lifetime (days to weeks), combined with its strong warming potential, means that targeted strategies to reduce BC
emissions can be expected to provide climate benefits within the next several decades. 

- BC mitigation strategies, which lead to reductions in PM 2.5, can provide substantial public health and environmental benefits. SOURCE: [EPA -- Report to Congress on Black Carbon: Executive Summary](http://www.epa.gov/blackcarbon/2012report/ReportHighlightsExecSummary.pdf) (PDF)

They also note that there are mitigating factors that may help cool the planet as well but they are clear that this is a pollutant and clear that mitigation strategies to stop it will have "substantial public health and environmental benefits".

So no, it is not harmless.  

I hope you consider the EPA a reliable source.
 




 Uhmm...no:

Black carbon, a component of diesel pollution, is also one of the largest drivers of climate change. Black carbon is a form of particulate matter emitted by diesels (and other sources) that warms the atmosphere by absorbing sunlight and radiating heat into the air (like a blacktop road). It can also darken snow and ice, and directly accelerate melting. The United States has the highest per-capita emissions of black carbon in the world, with more than half coming from diesel engines.  [SOURCE](http://www.catf.us/diesel/)

That said there are not many of these morons doing this so the overall impact is small but still... 




 [Stephen Colbert embraces rolling coal (Video)](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/07/18/stephen-colbert-embraces-rolling-coal-video/) 




  Assuming that info is accurate- fuck those practices.

I cannot say whether it is true or not but a quick Google search shows it being repeated a lot.  Here is one that cites a media source:

Whats particularly egregious, they say, is the number of commercial properties with hundreds of thousands of dollars in outstanding debt owed. Those numbers even surprised WDIV Channel 4 in an April segment on debts to the department. An unpaid water bill of $150 pales in comparison to the outstanding fees of some big players in the city. As the segment reported, Joe Louis Arena owes roughly $80,000, and Ford Field about $55,000. Palmer Park Golf Club and the VA Hospital both owe an estimated $200,000. On top of that, the city of Detroit still has a number of vacant buildings gushing water long after being abandoned, as Steve Neavling of Motor City Muckraker reported last year. [SOURCE](http://metrotimes.com/news/news-hits/protesters-decry-detroit-residential-water-shutoffs-1.1700421)
 




 Lets be clear. These water shut offs are not about unpaid bills. This is about dispossession of the people. These shutoffs are intended to drive people from their homes. Water is the wedge. People are being targeted at the rate of 1500 to 3000 homes a week.


One of the ways we know this is not about unpaid bills is the glaring contradiction between the treatment of homeowners and corporate clients. DPS, under its emergency manger, owes $2.2 million in outstanding bills. Palmer Park Golf Club owes $200,000, Joe Louis Arena/Red Wings Hockey owes $80,000 and Ford Field $55,000. The struggling city of Highland Park, also under emergency management, owes $17.4 million.

 It really is.

Even more astounding is how many of these people you see in jobs that are writing oriented (e.g. journalists).  It's scary sometimes.
 




 "This must all be destroyed!"
 














 To be fair a lot of the practice needed to become a good writer is to read a lot (and in particular other good writers).

I am not saying actually writing isn't a part of it.  It certainly is and this seems like laziness on the part of the teachers.  Just saying not all is lost.
 




 This 100%!

Everyone *thinks* they can write because they learned in kindergarten. 

Writing is a real skill and it takes practice and a lot of reading to get good at it.  Most people suck at it (and that is not hyperbole).

I had an IT job which was laying people off year after year and I am certain it was my skill at writing (which was not in any way a part of the requirements for the job) that had me keep my position.  I was good at the core of my job but so were the other people.  The difference was I could also write well and communicate well with our clients and that made a huge difference in how I was perceived by my bosses and clients.

Writing will be a part of most any career and writing well certainly will help you stand out.  You need not aspire to winning a Pulitzer.  Just solid grammar and a bit of care will get you most of the way there.
 




 *"The only time you need to worry about what's in your neighbor's bowl is if you're checking to make sure they have enough."* ~Louis CK 




 I'm going to go a step further and say that they 100% will not work.

You are correct.

It cannot work.  The energy it will produce cannot be enough to do what it says it does (lit up, heated and powering the US) even with generous assumptions.  Not even remotely close.

Here is an engineer familiar with solar installations doing the real-world math for you: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage v=obS6TUVSZds#t=583
 




 From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_thermal_unit):

The British thermal unit (BTU or Btu) is a traditional unit of energy equal to about 1055 joules. It is the amount of energy needed to cool or heat one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. In science, the joule, the SI unit of energy, has largely replaced the BTU. 




 Hamas is [funded by Iran](http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Foreign-Policy/2014/0709/Iran-connection-Why-are-Gaza-rockets-reaching-so-deep-into-Israel-video) and Iran has no interest in seeing peace come to the area.

There have been honest attempts, from both sides, in the past 50+ years to broker a real peace deal but such peace is invariably scuttled by one side or the other.  It is trivially easy for those who want to see the conflict continue for their own reasons to keep stirring the pot.

Consider how much money Iran has spent arming Palestinians (tens of millions of dollars...maybe hundreds) and how much good that money could do if it were used to build schools and such.

Remember when Israel was formed after WWII other Arab countries had agreed to absorb the Palestinians.  When the time came they shut their borders to them.

I am not saying Israel is innocent here.  FAR from it!  Just realize you can point to a lot of culpable parties here of which Israel is just one.

 Probably.  They have to know that nuking somone is the one thing that will 100% motivate the rest of the world to come down on them like a ton of bricks.  Not even China could protect them. Indeed to maintain control over its backyard it is likely China would be the ones kicking NK ass.

All well and good but the flip side is we cannot liberate NK concentration camps because:

A) NK has nukes

B) They have something like 10,000+ artillery tubes trained on Seoul, South Korea

C) China

If the NK leadership is about to go down then they start throwing nukes.

That really is all nukes do.  They tell everyone else that if you attack and start winning we throw nukes and everyone loses.  Central tenet of MAD (mutually assured destruction).

So, we cannot help the people in NK.  Not a chance of that in any foreseeable future.
 




 NK missiles [can't quite reach the US](http://in.reuters.com/article/2013/03/08/korea-north-military-missile-idINDEE92706220130308) (parts of Alaska maybe but empty parts).  Yet.  They are working on it diligently.

The leadership are child-like in their actions but they have some smart people in their country and their nukes and missiles work.

More likely than attacking the US directly where their missiles can only just barely reach they would more likely threaten South Korea and Japan which are well within range of their missiles.  Tokyo is an easy shot for them.

If you do not think their missiles and nukes are threatening enough and too high-tech then consider they have an ungodly amount of artillery along the border with South Korea that can easily range on Seoul (over 25 million people in that area).  Enough artillery to throw the equivalent of a nuke into the area in less than an hour.

That is WWII (hell, WWI) tech. 




 If you think for one second China would be cool with American adventurism in North Korea you are sadly misinformed.  China WOULD fight the US if the US invaded North Korea.

There is precedent for this.  China fought the US in the Korean War directly (pew pew).  They WILL do so again.

China may not be thrilled with North Korea but they see it as part of their hegemony and absolutely will not tolerate the US there in the slightest.

NK would have to nuke someone for the US to have its *casus belli* to go in there.   




 There are numerous legal opinions that can be found about whether Congress can sue the President and they nearly all agree that Congress cannot do this.  They hold this opinion regardless of ideology because this has already been pretty well established.  Here is a [conservative viewpoint on why it will fail and is a waste of time](http://www.forbes.com/sites/daviddavenport/2014/07/10/boehner-vs-obama-to-sue-or-not-to-sue-that-is-the-question/).

If you do not want to read the article the short version is Congress lacks standing to bring such a lawsuit.  They cannot show they have incurred damages thus have no room to complain to a court about this.

There is nothing new about this stance from the courts.  In the end the courts view this as a political problem to be solved via the political process.  Congress is far from powerless in this regard.  As a practical matter they may be frozen today but they DO possess the power to rectify these problems on their own without court intervention which is (rightly) why the courts want to stay out of it.
 




 Yeah...big time. North Korea is under protection of China as it is China's back yard. Going to war in North Korea would mean war with China. 

Both are nuclear states too.

 Generally, to be legally valid, most contracts must contain two elements:

- All parties must agree about an offer made by one party and accepted by the other.
- Something of value must be exchanged for something else of value. This can include goods, cash, services, or a pledge to exchange these items.

In addition, certain contracts are required by state law to be in writing (real estate transactions, for example), while others are not. [SOURCE](http://www.sba.gov/community/blogs/contract-law-%E2%80%93-how-create-legally-binding-contract)

 More people should read the Federalist Papers where a few of the founding fathers set forth a lot of their thinking on how the government should work.

AMONG the numerous advantages promised by a well constructed Union, none deserves to be more accurately developed than its tendency to break and control the violence of faction. The friend of popular governments never finds himself so much alarmed for their character and fate, as when he contemplates their propensity to this dangerous vice. He will not fail, therefore, to set a due value on any plan which, without violating the principles to which he is attached, provides a proper cure for it. The instability, injustice, and confusion introduced into the public councils, have, in truth, been the mortal diseases under which popular governments have everywhere perished; as they continue to be the favorite and fruitful topics from which the adversaries to liberty derive their most specious declamations.

By a faction, I understand a number of citizens, whether amounting to a majority or a minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adversed to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community.

snip


From this view of the subject it may be concluded that a pure democracy, by which I mean a society consisting of a small number of citizens, who assemble and administer the government in person, can admit of no cure for the mischiefs of faction. A common passion or interest will, in almost every case, be felt by a majority of the whole; a communication and concert result from the form of government itself; and there is nothing to check the inducements to sacrifice the weaker party or an obnoxious individual. Hence it is that such democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths. Theoretic politicians, who have patronized this species of government, have erroneously supposed that by reducing mankind to a perfect equality in their political rights, they would, at the same time, be perfectly equalized and assimilated in their possessions, their opinions, and their passions.


A republic, by which I mean a government in which the scheme of representation takes place, opens a different prospect, and promises the cure for which we are seeking. Let us examine the points in which it varies from pure democracy, and we shall comprehend both the nature of the cure and the efficacy which it must derive from the Union.

 What does it say about American democracy that the political will of the American voters is being continuously overruled by courts regarding the gay marriage issue. 

It says it is alive and well.

The country was setup with checks-and-balances.  It's right in the Constitution.  Go check.

As such the courts are a check on the executive and legislatures (and vice versa).  This is how it is *supposed* to work.

If you believe the people of a state can institute any policy they like and be done with it then you do not believe in American democracy.  Period.

 




 Well, there isn't a court yet that agrees with you.

An appeals court also found today that banning same sex marriage is a violation of the constitution: [Federal appeals court: Utah can't ban gay marriage](http://bigstory.ap.org/article/court-utah-gay-marriage-ban-unconstitutional)

The article notes that there are now 14 federal rulings in favor of same sex marriage (this does not count state court rulings).
 




 It seems you are suggesting homosexuality is a choice.

Simple question then:

Did you ever sit down and choose to be a heterosexual?  Did you work through the pros and cons of being a heterosexual versus a homosexual? Do you know anyone who did that?

If you talk to most homosexual people they will tell you that when they started figuring out they were homosexual (usually in high school) they would, given a choice, choose to be heterosexual.  Being a gay teen is pretty rough...few would choose it if it were an actual choice.
 









 With Nexus Mod Manager or Steamworks (especially Steamworks) there is almost nothing to it.  A few things can still be a pain to setup (ENB is a bit of a hassle) but beyond a handful of things these managers make adding and managing mods about as painless as can be.

Yeah you have to spend some time researching them but you can find recommended lists online that are fine to go with if you do not want to look into each one yourself.

I estimate I spent a good two hours (maybe a bit more) farting around getting all the mods I wanted but it was well worth it.
 




  However, electricity itself is caused by the movement of electrons, which have a rest mass, and are therefore technically "matter" under a looser definition.

To be a bit more clear on this electrons do not move very much at all in an electric current.  They do move a bit but the speed (called "drift") is actually quite slow on the order of fractions of a millimeter per second.  

It is more akin to having a tube 100% filled with water and adding a drop at the top and a drop falls out the bottom (ignore gravity and surface tension for the moment).  The top drop did not travel all the way through...it barely got anywhere at all.  But if you add a stream of water into the top then you get a stream of water (a current if you like) out the bottom.
 









 It is pretty straight forward.  You have money coming in and money going out.  You need to make the money coming in more than the money going out.

Keep a ledger for a month and write down *everything* you spend money on right down to a pack of gum (keep all your receipts for the day and add them up at night).  Note what goes where in the ledger such as household bills (electric, gas), food, entertainment, etc.

Then figure out what your total income is.

With these pieces in hand start looking for places to cut costs.  Eat out less.  Be more frugal when food shopping, cool your place to only 77 instead of 72 in the summer, look for coupons and bargains and so on.  Also, after necessities like food and electricity, pay off credit cards and any other high interest debts you have as fast as possible.  Your interest payments help keep you underwater so getting rid of those first will help the most.  Interest payments are wasted money.

You need to keep cutting till your income exceeds your expenses.  
 




 Have you added any mods yet?  They may not be enough to change your mind but there are a helluva lot of them and they can substantially improve on the vanilla experience. 

Indeed mods are a huge bonus in Bethesda games. You're missing out if you ignore them and with SteamWorks or Nexus Mod Manager they are pretty easy to use. Ever for a purist the GUI mods are not to be missed.  




 Good thing too.  If the sun *burned* its fuel (rather than via a nuclear reaction) it would only have enough fuel to last about 50,000 years or so.  

In the 1800's, before nuclear reactions were understood, scientists calculated that 50,000 year figure and had an immediate problem since they believed the earth to be about 100 million years old.  That age for the earth was also too young by a long shot but it remains they had a problem since it was not possible for the earth to be older than the sun.

They figured it all out in the early 1900's and now the numbers line up nicely.
 




 Because we all have considerable experience in this.  You see dozens of people every day (even if only on TV) and in the course of your life you have gotten a lot of information about the ages of some of those people.

Your brain simply matches up what it knows about people of various ages and characteristics they share to be able to have an informed guess about someone's age and generally you will be pretty close.
 




 Eh...if it was a urinal cake of George Bush (the junior one) I'd probably find it kinda funny.

My only reservation is (regardless of who the president is) that there should be some respect for the office of the president.

But whatever...in the scheme of things this is small potatoes.

What it mostly shows is the class level of this Faith Conference.  Apparently juvenile potty humor is part of their message. 




 Amazing.  I cannot imagine how much practice it takes to become adept at this (a metric crapton I suspect).

 "Job creators are being taxed to death."

Where?  How?  By who?

The marginal business tax rate maxes out at 35% in the US.  Sounds pretty bad except I doubt there is a corporation out there in that bracket (income of over $18.33 million) who actually pays that rate.  Indeed the GAO calculated that [U.S. corporations pay average effective tax rate of 12.6%.](http://money.cnn.com/2013/07/01/news/economy/corporate-tax-rate/)  That puts the US [among the lowest taxed countries in the world for corporations.](http://www.kpmg.com/global/en/services/tax/tax-tools-and-resources/pages/corporate-tax-rates-table.aspx)

Not to mention it has been 35% since 1993 so hardly a new thing or something Obama did.

Look, I am not saying they haven't done something cool here.  Just saying stability control is not new tech.
 




 I was gonna say a [Capybara](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara) but yours (which I never heard of before), while looking very similar, seems a better guess.
 




 This is how they maximize profit.

Pretty much everyone who has a console has a PC.

If they came out with PC at the same time as console people with sufficient PCs will certainly buy the PC version.

This way, if you want to play and have a console, you will buy the console version.  You might then ALSO buy the PC version when it comes out.  The reverse is pretty much never true.

 




 Did they invent stability control?  I seem to remember active stability control being demonstrated by Mercedes(?) many years ago.  I assumed it never made it into production because of cost but then cost is not so much an issue with Koenigsegg.

  I want my freedom to listen to shitty hipster music while chasing a criminal, goddamn it!

Shitty indeed.

I am amazed at how bad most of the music is.  Seriously disappointing. 

I am not sure if they just wanted to go cheap on licensing or if there was some plan behind it all.  Whatever the case the music sucks and that was a real let down for me. 




 Basically they are paralyzed with fear.  They feel they are just barely floating with their mouth barely at the surface and anything they might do could be the thing that causes them to drown.  Also, they are no longer thinking as a rational person would.  They are terrified and it consumes them.
 




 Why are people downvoting this?  Did anyone read it?  It is a neat interactive chart mostly. (I thought it was neat anyway) 




 This really is a terribly complicated subject and one people have dedicated careers to get a handle on.  As such remember this is ELI5 so you will get the ELI5 answer that misses a lot of complexity.

In theory currency values are based upon Purchasing Power Parity (PPP).  This is the idea that the same basket of goods will have an equal price in any two countries.

Exchange rates, in theory, move towards PPP.

So let's say there are 100 one-dollar bills in my country and there are 200 one-peso bills in your country.  If a loaf of bread costs $1 in my country it should cost $2 in your country (the peso also uses the dollar sign).  Each loaf of bread costs 1% of the outstanding money in the country.  As such we would have an exchange rate of $1 US for $2 MEX.

As you can see how much currency, among other things, affects the value of your currency.  Go further and you can find one mechanism for the collapse of a currency.

Let's say I have $200 in my economy but I am in debt so I print more money.  Remember that loaf of bread costs 1% of the outstanding currency.  If I now have $300 in my economy because I printed money the bread now costs $3.  Thing is, the people who live there do not have more currency because more was printed.  They still have the (say) $5 they started with.

This is inflation.  Inflation devalues the money you have on hand.  If today the bread costs $2 and tomorrow it costs $3 your money is effectively worth less.  It takes more to get the same basket of goods.

A little inflation is actually a good thing.  Deflation is worse for an economy.  That said only a little is good.  A lot can be a real problem and it can get really, really bad (called hyper-inflation).  Hyper inflation can collapse the currency.  This is the point where the money is essentially worthless and the country reverts to a barter economy.  

As an example post WWI Germany experienced hyperinflation.  *"In 1922, a loaf of bread cost 163 marks. By September 1923, this figure had reached 1,500,000 marks and at the peak of hyperinflation, November 1923, a loaf of bread cost 200,000,000,000 marks."* ([SOURCE](http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/hyperinflation_weimar_germany.htm))

Zimbabwe has this problem now.  About a year ago (not sure where it stands today) Zimbabwe was printing a $100 trillion note that was [worth about $300 US](http://thefinanser.co.uk/fsclub/2013/07/zimbabwes-currency-crisis-and-the-100-trillion-dollar-note.html).
 




 If drowning actually leaves the person more 'stiff' though, does that mean it is alright to try and help them (since the story goes if you try to help a drowning person they'll just end up drowning you) ?

Absolutely not.  Going in after the person is your **last resort** when there is no other option.  

Remember they are panicked and in serious fear for their own life.  They will move and clamp on to you if you get within reach.  There is a reason it is not unheard of for two people to drown when one tried to save another.

Ideally you use a throwable floatation device to them or use a pool hook to get them out.  Lifeguards often have a throwable device they drag with them that they throw once they get close to the victim.

If you absolutely must swim to and grab the victim you should swim underwater the last 10 feet or so, grab the victim's legs and spin their back towards you.  Then slide up behind them with your arm around them.  This grants you some measure of control.  If the victim spins and seizes you do all you can to go back underwater.  The victim will NOT follow and will let go.
 









 Panic is what causes drowning far more than not being taught to swim.

Swimming (or at least not drowning) is pretty natural to humans.  As adults people who have not learned to swim panic and freeze up (the image of a person thrashing about while drowning is wrong...drowning people do not do that...[learning what a drowning person really looks like is important](http://lifehacker.com/know-what-drowning-really-looks-like-to-help-save-lives-511869654)).

Panic is the cause of that.  Babies do not "know" to panic so do fine in water. 




 Judges operate on the assumption that the facts presented to them by the police seeking the warrant are true.  The judge really has no ability to assess the validity of the representation by the police.  Warrants need to be issued quickly...they cannot spend months investigating whether the police really have just cause for the warrant.

What stops the police from bullshitting the judge is it is generally a bad idea to piss off a judge who you will have to go before numerous times.  Not to mention the judge could hit them with perjury charges. 









  Allowing medallions to be investments that you can't lose for being a terrible cab driver or a lack of use ruins the entire system.

I am not sure how it works elsewhere but in Chicago (where I live) it is very rare for the cab driver to own the medallion or even the cab.  These are owned by holding companies which then lease their cars out on a daily basis to drivers.

The cabbie has paid whatever it is (over $100 for 8 hours I think) to the cab company to use the car.  The cab company could not care less if they never pick up so much as a single fare.  The cab driver needs to make enough to cover the cost of leasing the cab and whatever is left is profit for them. 




 Note there are many different types of combustion engines out there.  I will assume you mean a typical 4-stroke engine you find in most cars these days.

[This animation](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/4StrokeEngine_Ortho_3D_Small.gif) shows it pretty clearly.  Each number is one of the "strokes" and there are four of them hence a 4-stroke engine (there are other kinds of this as well):

1 - Piston goes down, valve opens and a fuel/air mixture is drawn into the engine (today it may be a fuel injection system instead but serves the same purpose).

2 - Piston rises compressing the fuel/air mixture.  At the top of the stroke the spark plug fires which ignites the fuel mixture.

3 - The piston is pushed down by the exploding fuel mixture that was ignited in step #2 above (this is called the power stroke).

4 - The piston rises and a valve opens allowing the piston to push out the burnt fuel mixture into the exhaust system.

Note:  At the bottom the piston is attached to the crank shaft which connects to the transmission and wheels.

 




 I do not know if you have seen this before or (if you haven't) if will be of any help to you but you might find it interesting if nothing else.

 Fascinating!  Thanks! 




 If you have 5 smart TVs running 24/7 doing video streaming you'd hit your 300GB cap with Comcast in barely over a day.  Add in all the rest also running 24/7 and it'd be less than a day. 




 I cannot think what you would do at home that would use 200GB a day that is a bigger bandwidth hog than video streaming.

Only things that come to mind might be torrents and/or a home web server.  What you would want to torrent that uses 200GB (or a significant portion of that) per day (or 6 TB/month) *on a regular basis* is beyond me. I cannot imagine having enough storage at home to handle that (72TB/year). 

If you are running a web server from home to hit that bandwidth you are violating the Comcast TOS (nothing new there...they have never allowed that).

Bottom line, as you can see from the Sandvine stats I posted, you are waaaay beyond even heavy user usage (whatever it is you are doing). 




 I'm curious what the hell the OP is doing to consume that much bandwidth?

At the *most* Netflix will consume about [2.3GB/hour](http://www.gci.com/kb/netflix-movie-and-data-usage) to stream high definition movies.  That works out to 13 hours of high definition movies per day at your current rate.

This is WAY over the average consumption of internet users and well above the average of the top 15%:

The Sandvine report also examined consumption patterns among different cohorts of users. The top 15% of bandwidth users dominate network usage in North America, accounting for 54% of total monthly network traffic in March. That group consumes on average 212 gigabytes per month, the equivalent of 100 hours of video and more than seven times the 29 GB of a typical subscriber. (Sandvine termed this top 15th percentile of users cord-cutters, speculating that they are relying on the Internet for video entertainment  but it doesnt actually know whether those consumers have canceled pay TV.)


Overall, mean average usage per subscriber for wireline broadband in North America was 51.4 GB in the first half of 2014, up from 44.5 GB last fall. That increase is in line with the 30%-40% annual growth rate in bandwidth consumption ISPs are forecasting for 2014, according to Sandvine. [SOURCE](http://variety.com/2014/digital/news/netflix-youtube-bandwidth-usage-1201179643/)

Netflix will be your biggest use by far.  Games and music do not come close (people think games are a big use but they really aren't apart from the initial download of a given game...online gaming is pretty low bandwidth...IIRC Battlefield 3 uses about 80MB/hour).  Normal browsing and email hardly register.

I am no fan of Comcast by a long stretch but maybe this time they have a legitimate gripe.  I cannot imagine what your house is doing to consume that much bandwidth.

Whatever the case [I hope you don't live in my neighborhood.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgang1izeh0)
 




 You should be deeply skeptical.  If they really had a cure for baldness they would be falling over themselves to have independent, double-blind studies performed.

We see none of that here.

Currently there is no "cure" for male pattern baldness.  You can get hair transplants and the future may offer some hope in the form of [hair cloning or natural regeneration](http://www.askmen.com/sports/health_200/223_mens_health.html) but it will be awhile yet before those options become available (or maybe never...have to wait and see).

 Like you I have played since the very first Civ game and have been a huge fan all along the way.  I liked Civ 5 when it came out and now, with all its DLC and whatnot, I think it is one of the best games ever.  Certainly my favorite.

That said this looks like Civ 5 with renamed units.  Basically the same game except you call Unit-A Unit B and make it look different.

Don't get me wrong...I love the Civ 5 gameplay but if the difference is largely cosmetic with a different story I don't see the point.  I'll just keep playing Civ 5 happily.

 The Swiss approach to self-defense has never been one of overwhelming military force (indeed that might scare neighbors and provoke them).

Instead the Swiss approach is one of being more trouble than it is worth to attack them.

Germany could certainly take Switzerland if it so chose but the cost would be steep and the gains not worth it.  The Swiss know their mountains very well so an invasion would be difficult and costly in terms of men and machines. 
 




 For copyright reasons I cannot quote all of the explanation found at [this link](http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/the-birds-and-the-bees.html) which answers your question.

Short version: It is unclear where it originated but there are a few good guesses with the best being it is from *"the work of the American naturalist John Burroughs. In 1875, he published a set of essays titled 'Birds and Bees, Sharp Eyes and other Papers'. Burrough's aimed to present nature to children in a way that they could easily understand and appreciate."*
 




 Yeah...I live in Chicago in a condo and the decks are all wood.  Most buildings (and perhaps city code...not sure but definitely building rules) will not allow you to have a charcoal grill as it is a serious fire hazard (and it is not just your place at stake but the building filled with everyone else too).

Gas grilling is the only choice.

I just wish, given that there are a LOT of gas grills out there, these celeb chefs would show us some love too and give grilling recipes and tips for gas grills. (I know there are some but charcoal seems to be most of it) 




 Why would they?

Not like Nader voters would ever pull the lever for Bush. 




  His (somewhat simplistic) view is that because there is mass, there is matter.

Matter and energy are equivalent ( see E=MC^2 ).  Matter can be converted to energy and vice versa and energy has gravity as well as matter.

If you put a box around the earth and magically converted all the mass of earth to energy the moon would remain in orbit same as if the earth was still matter.

We usually do not experience gravity with energy because we are rarely around that much energy in one place (your mass converted to energy would be on the order of around [10,000 megatons](http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=122487))

So, if all the matter sucked into a black hole is converted to energy you will still feel the gravitational pull same as if it stayed as matter. 




 In the US we have a First Past the Post voting system. This makes it a near certainty that you end up with a two party system due to strategic voting (eg you vote against someone more than you vote for someone). 

Third parties just split the ticket as happened with Gore and Nader seeing Bush take the White House.  
























 ...but should not be mandatory.

Yes it should me mandatory.  Why wouldn't it be mandatory?  It is relevant information for a potential partner.

While some may say it is irrelevant, and if the person otherwise likes them, why tell?

I submit it is relevant because it is not for one person to decide what should or should not be important to the other person.  

Yeah, I wish people were more chill about it all but in the end it has to be for them to decide.


 




 That is outstanding voter turnout!

Sure 100% (or near enough) participation would be ideal but compared to most democracies (real ones, not the 100% turnout in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea) that turnout seems really good.

It blows the doors off of US voter turnout.

 




 Flash is pretty OP.  He needs to be nerfed.

(Note:  It has been a long time since I read the comics so maybe he got one...at one point Flash seemed pretty much an "I win" button.)
 




 Isn't that true of pretty much every superhero (good or bad) versus Batman?

Batman's gig is being prepared for any (or most) contingencies.  He will outsmart the other guy.  That is not to say Batman is actually smarter (although in many cases he is) but rather he is good at luring his opponents into the situation he wants them in.

Where other superheroes overpower people Batman tricks or outsmarts them.

It's kinda like saying you have a howitzer and I have a pistol.  You would have the bigger gun but that is not necessarily a win button.
 




 This vote had 84% (or better) participation.

I am curious how much participation there is in other, more general (or common/usual) votes from Scotland.

I am really asking.  If there is one thing we see in the US regarding having a shitty government it is horridly low turnout rates in elections.  There is a reason conservatives work relentlessly to disenfranchise certain voting blocks every chance they get (in the US).

If the US had 84% turnout rates for every election our congressional makeup would be dramatically different.  Would the same be true in the UK?  (Again, really asking.)

 To be fair prior to TDK there was no good reason to suppose that Heath Ledger would make a good Joker.  He had some great roles (notably in Brokeback Mountain) but as the Joker?  I was not seeing it at all.  While I was not posting about it I did not have high hopes either.

Ledger blew me away with his performance.  It was truly outstanding IMO and I was more than pleasantly surprised.

  But if a girl falsely claims rape or goes after for bullshit child support like this, there's not much defense for many men.

I may be wrong but I think it is not the woman going for child support but rather the state.  The woman has sought public assistance.  The state, in an effort to lower the costs of such assistance has taken to tracking down the fathers of these children and forcing them to pay.  This case is clearly an injustice but I think the state welfare agency is blind to circumstances.  It wants its money back, it identifies the father and that is the end of it to them.
 




  I've never met a straw feminist.

[Catherine MacKinnon](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Catharine_MacKinnon) and [Andrea Dworkin](http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/a/andrea_dworkin.html) leap to mind.  While you may have not met them they are feminists with a national (or even international) stage, have published numerous well selling books and regularly give speeches to large groups.

EDIT to add:  I provide examples of nationally known famous feminists (not fringe by a long shot) of the type the poster says he/she has never met and I get downvoted?  If he/she wants to say "they hardly represent feminism" then who does by their reckoning?  Certainly there is a continuum and no one person can be said to represent the larger group.  The reality is MacKinnon and Dworkin are/were at the forefront of these issues and certainly sold a helluva lot of books to someone as well as drawing large groups to hear them speak.  They are not "fringe".
 




 I've never, ever met a feminist who wasn't totally pleasant, rational, or who lies about being threatened with rape or anything like that.

I do not think they are lying.

I do wonder though how real these threats are.  Anyone who has played online or engaged in a comments section of countless websites (YouTube in particular) has probably had vile things said to them and been threatened.

It is despicable to be sure but it is also common and usual and done regardless if you are a female or a male.

If these women are seriously worried about these threats then they need to be on the phone to the local police and perhaps the FBI to report these incidents and perhaps get police protection.  They should see to it that the police zealously pursue the people in question.  It really should not be too hard for the police to track these people down.  [Issuing threats is a crime](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_threatening).
 









 The main benefit usually comes in the form of more content.  Mass Effect 3 had a main character added as part of a pre-order bonus.  While I find the practice reprehensible I had become so invested in MA that I kinda felt obliged.  Sucks but there it is (I feel dirty).

 




 I was of the opinion that pre-ordering was a dumb idea but I admit I caved on occasion (with Mass Effect 3 and Rome II in particular).  There were some others as well and I got burned a few times but Rome II was the last straw for me.  I have not pre-ordered since.

That said I might fall of the wagon and pre-order again sometime in the future (never say never) and I figure if any game will get me to do it Witcher 3 will be the one.  I trust they are in it to please their base and care about their rep.

For the most part I am off pre-ordering though and it was Rome II that cinched it for me.  I can say with reasonable certainty I will never pre-order another Total War game ever again.
 




 Beats headphones are not exactly *bad* headphones but they are very bass heavy and very overpriced for what you are getting.  In the same price range you can find much better options or get something as good for less).

  Do you mean 60% margins? Because 60% market share would be enormous in the "premium" headphone industry.

Nope...it is almost 60% market share:

The numbers are astonishing. According to a recent piece in the Wall Street Journal, Beats revenues increased fivefold between 2010 and 2012 alone, hitting the $1 billion mark. As of this summer, some 59 percent of high-end headphones sold in the U.S. bear the Beats logo. All this despite the fact that the audiophile press has often viewed Beats as underwhelmingor worseand overpriced. [SOURCE](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2013/09/beats_by_dre_market_share_how_the_headphones_company_conquered_the_market.html)

What I did not realize till reading that article is that Beats is also affiliated with Monster...the company that sells outrageously overpriced cables hyped to provide all sorts of benefits when in reality they are no better than cables at small fractions of their cost.  Now Beats makes sense as more of the same.  Over priced hype that does not deliver compared to other options in the same price range.

Every time I see someone on the train wearing Beats I want to point and laugh.

EDIT to add: This recent video by Marques Brownlee, [The Truth About Beats by Dre!,](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxQxS0AdBY list=UUBJycsmduvYEL83R_U4JriQ) claims Beats has 64% of the market.  
 




 As too often happens the choice is not to vote "for" someone but to vote against someone.  You may not like Clinton but would you really rather pull the lever for (say) a Romney/Palin ticket?

 I wish I was happy.  Truly happy.

Now you might say, "*POOF* You are in a box but at least you are happy!"

Well, sounds ok to me.  I mean if I am really and truly happy in that box then why not? 




 Not just because it isn't a priority, but also because there's no way to get the majority of the house and the senate and the states to agree on something this controversial 

Maybe or maybe not.  More than a few conservatives have been primaried out of their seats by Tea Party faithful with the backing of serious outside money.  Enough to scare the ones who are left.

Being an incumbent is a huge advantage but one that is seriously minimized with no limit to outside money.  Congresscritters would rather get back to the good old days of safe seats.

As for the states I have seen nothing to suggest the public is anything but pissed at Citizen's United.
 




 You are prosecuted by the state.  It only matters what his wife wants inasmuch as they may not be able to build a case without her.  But if there are witnesses (or in this case video footage) of a crime being committed then they do not need the victim to cooperate and the victim saying they do not want to press charges does not make the crime go away.

 




 Pretty much this and what /u/forresja said.

You could be in an all woman office and show nude breasts and someone might get fussed about it.  Whether that is right or wrong is another discussion.

The NSFW tag is there to let people know something on the other end *might* be considered offensive by some and could be problematic if viewed at work and someone else sees the screen.

I am making no value judgement on it.  Personally I think the link is barely NSFW and far from porn or being titillating.  Others might have a different opinion though hence the warning.
 




 We do not and cannot know, with certainty, that free will exists.  We operate on the assumption it does.  If it didn't we'd have the question the OP poses.  Why throw someone in jail if they have no choice in what they are doing?  It'd be akin to punishing a glass for breaking when it is dropped.  It would be silly. 




  Adding a deterrent is like pulling the lever that switches the tracks. The trains actions are still deterministic, but that doesn't preclude responding to inputs. 

That still is not free will.

If you show me the color green and I walk and show me the color red and I stop I am responding to inputs but I do not have free will.

If the train (in your example) can make a decision of its own accord as to whether the switch ahead gets flipped or not then the train could be said to have free will.  If that is the case though then the OP's question does not make sense. 




 I'm not completely sold on my own opinion though, so that's why I would like to see other thoughts about this.

In most of the US going topless is [already legal for women](http://gotopless.org/topless-laws).  

Here are a bunch of pictures of [women in New York celebrating their right to go topless](http://www.ryot.org/photos-its-legal-to-go-topless-in-nyc-and-these-women-are-celebrating-it/570053) (NSFW).

In Europe there is even less of a stigma for going topless and they are pretty chilled out about it most places.
 




 I am adopted and the way it used to work was when the woman decided on putting her child up for adoption she'd contact an agency and all the medical bills would be taken care of.  The agency of course would get to put the child up for adoption.

Maybe things have changed but seems like a good way to go about it.
 




 Re-directed walking blew my mind.  I used to wonder how people could use the holodeck without bumping into walls.  Now I know.  Clever stuff!
 




 I wasn't wired like that but my parents made it abundantly clear what behavior was a expected of me. Of course I pushed the limits of that and I think it took two trips outside the restaurant (separate occasions ) for a serious chewing out to learn they were very serious. 

To this day I hate it when people order coffee after dinner. I'll still sit and wait politely though.

 It is not that nobody expects him to work after he is out of office.

It is the revolving door that congresscritters get from business.  Do their bidding and whatever happens they'll be sure to get a soft landing.

Exactly what expertise does Cantor being to an investment banking firm?  Before he was in congress he did legal work on real estate and not much of that.  He has been a politician for over 20 years.

So why is he worth $3.5 million with that resume?

  The writer loses a lot of credibility by calling the accommodation plan a scheme.

I agree it is not a well done headline.

That said "scheme" does not have to mean underhanded.  It can simply mean "a plan".
 









 Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines

At the end we learn they cannot kill Skynet because Skynet is everywhere, in all computers around the planet.

Skynet then proceeds to nuke most of the planet rendering most computers inoperable (blown-up, EMP or even no more power).  In short, Skynet lobotomized itself or worse (it probably killed about 99% of its brain power doing that).
 




 You are correct that there is no way in hell politicians will do this on their own.

 Your "source" is anecdotal and as a result tells us nothing.

- While people of color make up about 30 percent of the United States population, they account for 60 percent of those imprisoned. The prison population grew by 700 percent from 1970 to 2005, a rate that is outpacing crime and population rates. The incarceration rates disproportionately impact men of color: 1 in every 15 African American men and 1 in every 36 Hispanic men are incarcerated in comparison to 1 in every 106 white men. 

- Students of color face harsher punishments in school than their white peers, leading to a higher number of youth of color incarcerated. Black and Hispanic students represent more than 70 percent of those involved in school-related arrests or referrals to law enforcement. Currently, African Americans make up two-fifths and Hispanics one-fifth of confined youth today.

 There is nothing racist or nationalist about supporting the enforcement of your country's laws.

 I love seeing couples like this.

   I agree they are terrible for the environment...but they are still more convenient.

The question no one seems to be asking is are paper bags worse for the environment?

I know the knee jerk reaction is paper is biodegradable and "natural" so therefore are better than a petroleum product (i.e. plastic bags).  Thing is you need to consider the whole process and not just the end result in a landfill.

Paper is terrible on several counts.  You need to chop down trees to make it (bad) and paper production is far, far more energy intensive than making a plastic bag.  Further, in many cases, paper production uses large quantities of chemicals that are bad for the environment.

When you put it all together the plastic bag is by far the "greener" product save for its bad habit of not degrading in a landfill.

Some will say use a cloth bag and bring it to the store.  That is fine for many people but for others (including me) that is problematic.  I shop on my way home from work.  I commute via mass transit and stop at the store on my way home.  I am not likely to be carrying shopping bags with me everywhere I go so I can use them at the end of the day nor do I want to walk all the way home, get my bags then backtrack to go shopping and backtrack again to home.

EDIT to add:  Not sure why the downvotes.  I can only assume it is a kneejerk reaction that plastic=bad.  Well, you are right, plastic is an environmental problem.  No doubt.  But then so too is paper.  

- Causes pollution: Paper production emits air pollution, specifically 70 percent more pollution than the production of plastic bags [source: Thompson]. According to certain studies, manufacturing paper emits 80 percent more greenhouse gases [source: Lilienfield]. And, consider that making paper uses trees that, instead, could be absorbing carbon dioxide. The paper bag making process also results in 50 times more water pollutants than making plastic bags [source: Thompson].
- Consumes energy: Even though petroleum goes into making plastic, it turns out that making a paper bag consumes four times as much energy as making a plastic bag, meaning making paper consumes a good deal of fuel [source: reusablebags.com].
- Consumes water: The production of paper bags uses three times the amount of water it takes to make plastic bags [source: Lilienfield].
- Inefficient recycling: The process of recycling paper can be inefficient -- often consuming more fuel than it would take to make a new bag [source: Milstein]. In addition, it takes about 91 percent more energy to recycle a pound of paper than a pound of plastic [source: reusablebags.com].
- Produces waste: According to some measures, paper bags generate 80 percent more solid waste [source: Lilienfield].
- Biodegrading difficulties: Surprisingly, the EPA has stated that in landfills, paper doesn't degrade all that much faster than plastics [source: Lilienfield].**** [SOURCE](http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/green-science/paper-plastic1.htm) 




 When I got married my (soon to be) wife got me a computer from [Falcon Northwest](http://www.falcon-nw.com/).  These guys preceded Alienware by a good margin and did boutique PC builds right.  Their stuff is great.

Can you build a comparable PC cheaper?  You bet!  You always can.  That said the build quality and *especially* the support from Falcon were superb.  

I have since taken to building my own PCs and that is really the only way to go for high end rigs BUT if you can't be arsed to do that and/or you want the support and warranty (and have money to burn) then I am not sure you can do much better than Falcon Northwest.  They've been quietly doing their thing for over 20 years.

 I live in Chicago which has some fantastic steak houses.  At all of these everything is ala carte.  Put another way if you only order a steak you get a plate with a steak on it and nothing else.  All sides are extra.

- Smith and Wollensky (a chain in several US cities) [Filet Mignon: $42 10 oz](http://www.smithandwollensky.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SWCH_DinnerMenu_Spring2014.pdf) (PDF)

- Gibson's: [Filet Mignon: $39.75 10oz](http://www.gibsonssteakhouse.com/dinner-menu-pages-332.php)

- Gene   Georgetti's: [Filet Mignon: $37.75 small](http://geneandgeorgetti.com/dinner-menu/)

And so it goes...$21 gets you that shitty grayish/brown hockey puck of a steak.  The steaks listed above are stupidly expensive but they are (usually) a meal you literally will never forget.  A really good cut of steak cooked to perfection is pretty special.

Again, none of the above include anything but the steak on a plate.  You will be lucky to leave for less than $100/person with drinks +tip from these places.

Shitty thing is I went to a really good butcher in Chicago (Paulina Market) and they sell an aged NY Strip for [over $39/pound](https://www.paulinameatmarket.com/?p=shop cid=beef).  While they provide great cuts of meat it is fucking ridiculous...I could go to any of the above and pay barely more to have it cooked for me and have others do the dishes.  Their filet mignon are near $38/pound.   




 I'm new to this sub-Reddit.  Why is this being downvoted?  (seriously)

I think this is hilarious!  A good movie?  Nope.  Not by a light year but is this only for pop movies?  If so is there a sub-Reddit better suited for this?

 









 I'm with you and the problem is restaurants like to put it in damn near every thing they possibly can.  Ok, a bit of hyperbole but seriously, it is pervasive cuz it is healthy or some shit.

As noted there is a portion of the population genetically disposed to not liking it (and I am one of them) so it is not even a matter of learning to like it.

It is fine that some dishes use it as no one expects every dish to be to their liking and some people genuinely like the stuff.  But it need not be on nearly as many dishes as it is.  Is it really necessary in every bowl of salsa in every Mexican restaurant ever?  It is really necessary on practically every dish at Wow Bao? (I always ask them to hold the cilantro yet almost invariable they drop it on the dish anyway.)

I do not know if everyone is like this but I feel like the princess in the Princess and the Pea story when it comes to cilantro.  I swear I can taste one speck of that shit if it is anywhere in the dish. 




 Liberals should start protests like this outside gun shops or their churches.

 Alaska is the northernmost, westernmost and easternmost state in the US.   




 Decades?

Do you understand that this area of the world has been fought over since around 1,000 BCE (and perhaps earlier than that)?  The Kingdom of Israel was formed around 930 BCE.

This shit has been going on for 3,000+ years.  Both sides, every side, can (and do) point at the other and claim a near endless litany of injustices done to them.

EDIT to add: Also, imagine you took over a portion of your neighbor's back yard.  Your neighbor declares it his mission in life to kill you and your family and take everything from you.  He's so pissed that even giving him his bit of land back will not assuage him.  He wants nothing less than to annihilate you and your family.

Now, you took a piece of that guy's land so you can understand he is pissed.  Would you then be ok that he was looking for any opportunity to kill you and your family because you deserve it or something?
 




 I do not think Hamas will be content if Israel stops illegal settlements:

                 THE COVENANT OF THE HAMAS - MAIN POINTS

                 =======================================



The Covenant of the Islamic Resistance Movement was issued on  August 
18, 1988. The Islamic Resistance Movement, also known as  the  HAMAS,  is an extremist fundamentalist Islamic organization operating in  the territories under Israeli control. Its Covenant  is  a  comprehensive manifesto comprised of 36 separate articles, all of which promote the basic HAMAS goal of destroying the  State  of  Israel  through  Jihad (Islamic  Holy  War).  The  following  are  excerpts  of  the   HAMAS Covenant:



Goals of the HAMAS:

------------------

'The Islamic  Resistance  Movement  is  a  distinguished  Palestinian

movement, whose allegiance is to Allah, and  whose  way  of  life  is

Islam. It strives to raise the banner of Allah  over  every  inch  of

Palestine.' (Article 6)



On the Destruction of Israel:

-----------------------------

'Israel will exist and  will  continue  to  exist  until  Islam  will

obliterate it, just as it obliterated others before it.' (Preamble)



The Exclusive Moslem Nature of the Area:

----------------------------------------

'The  land  of  Palestine  is  an  Islamic  Waqf  [Holy   Possession]

consecrated for future Moslem generations until Judgment Day. No  one

can renounce it or any part, or  abandon  it  or  any  part  of  it.'

(Article 11)



'Palestine is  an  Islamic  land...  Since  this  is  the  case,  the

Liberation of Palestine  is  an  individual  duty  for  every  Moslem

wherever he may be.' (Article 13) [SOURCE](http://fas.org/irp/world/para/docs/880818a.htm)

 I was in high school in the early 80's so programmable calculators were a rare thing and not forbidden.  As it happened I had one so I programmed my calculator to solve for "X" wherever it was in a calculation for my upcoming Physics exam.

Worked like a charm although the funny thing was that going through the process of programming the calculator I taught myself the material.  When taking the test it turned out I was faster just doing the problems normally without running my program (which was a little kludgy).

First time I ever finished an exam before anyone else.  Waaay before anyone else cuz I knew it so well.  Got a 98% IIRC.

tl;dr - Tried to cheat on a test and accidentally taught myself the material by setting up the cheat. 




  So much of the police force seems to be filled with men looking for power and acting like thugs.

It should come as no surprise that certain professions attract a certain "type".  These types are not a hard and fast rule as of course there is variance.  But if you graphed it you'd probably come out with a bell curve with a certain type as prevalent at the top of the bell curve.

There are of course many good and conscientious police officers.  Unfortunately the profession attracts all too many of the type depicted in the OP.

The problem for the good cops is police culture means they have to stay silent about the bad ones.  As a result their profession and how we (the public) feel about them as a group is colored by sociopaths like the guy in the OP.

I do not know whether to feel sympathy for the good cops having to live with that or hostility that they abide by the "code" that lets people like this prey on the public because they won't say anything.
 




 It depends how the company presents itself.

If at the outset your company says it is interested in reducing carbon emissions then fine.  Anyone who invests in your company knows that and cannot bring a successful lawsuit.

Such things, while they happen, are rare.  People invest in companies who will increase shareholder value.  That is kinda the point.

Hewlett Packard recently settled a lawsuit with shareholders for $57 million because they changed course:

Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) agreed to pay $57 million to settle a shareholder lawsuit accusing former Chief Executive Officer Leo Apotheker of making misleading statements about operations before he was ousted.

I am **NOT** saying I like the status quo but people here need to realize that "nice" companies are a pipe dream.  If you ever become CEO of a company your **LEGAL** responsibility is to the SHAREHOLDERS.  Period.  Full stop.  It is not to the environment.  It is not to poor people.  It does not matter how much you wish it were different.
 




 Interesting I am getting downvoted.

A fiduciary duty just isn't a notion some people have.  It is a legal responsibility and has legal ramifications for the people who have a fiduciary duty.

A fiduciary duty is an obligation to act in the best interest of another party. For instance, a corporation's board member has a fiduciary duty to the shareholders, a trustee has a fiduciary duty to the trust's beneficiaries, and an attorney has a fiduciary duty to a client.

.

A fiduciary obligation exists whenever the relationship with the client involves a special trust, confidence, and reliance on the fiduciary to exercise his discretion or expertise in acting for the client. The fiduciary must knowingly accept that trust and confidence to exercise his expertise and discretion to act on the client's behalf.

.

When one person does agree to act for another in a fiduciary relationship, the law forbids the fiduciary from acting in any manner adverse or contrary to the interests of the client, or from acting for his own benefit in relation to the subject matter. The client is entitled to the best efforts of the fiduciary on his behalf and the fiduciary must exercise all of the skill, care and diligence at his disposal when acting on behalf of the client. A person acting in a fiduciary capacity is held to a high standard of honesty and full disclosure in regard to the client and must not obtain a personal benefit at the expense of the client. [SOURCE](http://definitions.uslegal.com/b/breach-of-fiduciary-duty/)

Companies that violate that duty can and frequently are hit with shareholder lawsuits.  Such lawsuits are not uncommon.   




 I was on my phone posting so it was hard to tell but the NASA app seemed it might have the radio along with other stuff.  Some review complaints suggested videos thumbs in the sidebar kept changing which was distracting. Not to mention using more bandwidth. 

I figured the radio-only app was a better fit here. Lighter weight download, less other extraneous stuff. 
To each their own though. Whatever suits you.  




 Yes they would. At least publicly held companies would. The executives have a *fiduciary responsibility* to maximize shareholders' returns. 

They keep that in mind so they can sleep at night with a clear conscience.  




 I agree mandatory minimums have become a bad thing but in theory they were supposed to address real and serious disparities in sentencing.

 I can do everything I need to do for my job from home.  All I need is a computer, internet access and a phone.  I can sit in on meetings via Skype or conference call.

Many jobs are like mine in that the work can be done places other than the office.

I know of few employers who will be cool with you taking three months/year at home because you can do everything you need to do while on vacation.
 




  It's obvious that you are making conclusions based on zero information. 

Pot meet kettle.

Having policy meetings with many of the most powerful world leaders is your definition of vacation? 
snip
I guess Bush must have been great buddies with Putin and Angela Merkel for them to accompany him on his vacation multiple times.

Merkel went to his ranch once.  Bush entertained [17 dignitaries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prairie_Chapel_Ranch#Visits_from_foreign_dignitaries) at his ranch while in office.  Two of them visited twice.  If we assume each one stayed for two days that is 38 days out of 879.  

EDIT to add: I do not consider working trips to Camp David as "vacation".


 




  The second is child molestation. The victims often take years to come to terms.

Certainly there are cases where it can take a child well into adulthood to deal with childhood trauma.

That said a lot of "repressed memories" are induced and implanted by therapists:

In the early 1990s, the focus of Loftus work shifted to investigating whether it was possible to implant false memories for entire events that had never taken place. The impetus for this new line of research was a case for which Loftus had been asked to provide expert testimony in 1990.[9][10][12][14] The unique point in this case was that George Franklin stood accused of murder, but the only evidence against him was provided by his daughter, Eileen Franklin-Lipsker, who claimed that she had initially repressed the memory of him raping and murdering her childhood friend, Susan Nason, 20 years earlier, and had only recently recovered it while undergoing therapy.[9][10][14] Loftus gave evidence about the malleability of memory, but had to concede that she did not know of any research about the particular kind of memory Franklin-Lipsker was claiming to have; Franklin was convicted (though in 1996 he was released upon appeal).[9][10][14]

.

At that time, many others were also making accusations, both in and out of court, based on recovered memories of trauma.[14] Loftus began work to find out whether some of these recovered memories might in fact be false memories, created by the suggestive techniques used by some therapists at the time and encouraged in some self-help books.[9][10][14] Ethically, she could not try to convince research subjects that they had been sexually abused by a relative as a child, so Loftus had to come up with a paradigm that involved childhood trauma without causing harm to subjects. The lost in the mall technique was the result. The method involves attempting to implant a false memory of being lost in a shopping mall as a child and testing whether discussing a false event could produce a "memory" despite never happening. In her initial study, Loftus found that 25% of subjects came to develop a "memory" for the event which had never actually taken place.[10][14] Extensions and variations of the lost in the mall technique found that an average of one third of experimental subjects could become convinced that they experienced things in childhood that had never really occurredeven highly traumatic, and impossible events.[14] Loftus work was used to oppose recovered memory evidence provided in court[10] and resulted in stricter requirements for the use of recovered memories being used in trials as well as a greater requirement for corroborating evidence. In addition, some states no longer allowed prosecution based on recovered memory testimony and insurance companies were more reluctant to insure therapists against malpractice suits relating to recovered memories.[7][9][10] [SOURCE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Loftus#The_memory_wars)

(FWIW this researcher is held in high regard among her peers: "Loftus has been recognized throughout the world for her work, receiving numerous awards and honorary degrees. In 2002, Loftus was ranked 58th in the Review of General Psychologys list of the 100 most influential psychological researchers of the 20th century, and was the highest ranked woman on the list.") 




  I expect to get downvoted and called a racist or Republitard for bringing factual information into this.

Except there is barely any factual information to be found in your post.  "Bush spent a lot of money to have the Crawford ranch set up for many operations" is about as close to a fact that you get but it is vague, unsubstantiated and says nothing about how much work Bush did on his ranch.

Certainly the president (whoever it may be) at the very least gets the Presidential Daily Briefing (PDB) and depending on circumstances they may well have to work the whole day while on vacation.  

It remains that Bush spent 30% of his time in office away from the White House and Washington (not including business trips...just "vacation" time).
 




 It is Journalism 101 to ask for name pronunciation if there is the slightest doubt.

 It was recently struck down in Illinois:

In People v. Melongo, Docket No. 114852 (Ill. Mar. 20, 2014), the Supreme Court of Illinois held that Illinois' two-party eavesdropping statute, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/14-1, -2 (scroll down), was unconstitutional on its face. The statute made it a crime to use an "eavesdropping device" to overhear or record a phone call or conversation without the consent of all parties to the conversation, regardless of whether the parties had an expectation of privacy. The Court held that the recording provisions of the statute, as written, adversely affected the First Amendment rights of people making recordings in a substantial number of circumstances where there were no legitimate privacy interests.  The Court further held that a provision of the statute prohibiting the disclosure of recordings likewise ran afoul of the First Amendment.   

 This does not mean, however, that recording of communications is now universally permitted in Illinois:

- Recordings may still be subject to the "one-party" consent rule of the Federal wiretap act.
- Communications reaching other states may be subject to the wiretapping laws of the remote state.
- Secret recordings may still support an Illinois common-law claim for intrusion into the privacy of another. See, e.g., Narducci v. Village of Bellwood, 444 F. Supp. 2d 924, 938 (N.D. Ill. 2006).
- Another Illinois statute, not necessarily affected by the decision in the Melongo case, makes it illegal to "videotape, photograph, or film" people without their consent in "a restroom, tanning bed, or tanning salon, locker room, changing room or hotel bedroom." 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/26-4(a) (scroll down).

 Those great generals in the Civil War, crushing Germany in World War II, thats all that really stands out to me, said Mercer. The problem with the new curriculum, in his view, is that theres nothing in there about our military and all those victories.

Someone should remind Mercer that most of the great generals of the Civil War worked for the South and a lot of victories went to the South.  Maybe he figures the Civil War was great because no matter what Americans won.
 




 Yes.

The difference in the law would be your intent which can impact your sentence.  If your intent was to shoot the police officer and you missed but the bullet ricocheted and hit it will make no difference in your court case.   




 Really?

Near as I can tell she had been trying to put a lid on it because the story line is not trending in her favor.

I could be wrong though.  I really am only [watching from the sidelines.](http://i.imgur.com/rj59FUv.gif)   




 Same here. I posted some innocuous thing like, "Kinda wondering what's going on here too," and it was deleted. 

Till the TB post I was 100% clueless about the whole thing. Because of the mass deletions I investigated further.

Note to Ms. Quinn, the Streisand Effect is a real thing. 
 




 So, if you were a person who could be tapped to run a $50 million company would you accept an $80K salary?

Of course you wouldn't because you could easily get jobs paying 2x, 3x, 4x that or more.

Charities need to pay their executives somewhat commensurate with the going rate.  Same as if they want to hire a nurse they cannot expect to pay that person minimum wage because they are a charity.

This is normal and the good charities are up-front about where the money goes.  Generally if less than 33% goes to running the place (salaries, rent, electricity, water, etc) then things aren't so bad.

ALL organizations have costs.  None of any size can do the work for free (hell...cost of postage can be substantial).

That said it is wise to look into organizations before you donate to them to see how the money is spent.  Some are downright robbing people.  If you look at enough you will start to see the differences.

SOURCE: I have two family members who have worked for charities in executive roles (real and well recognized charities) and they also worked to improve the ethical standards of charities.  I have also worked for a charity myself (as an employee...several as a volunteer).
 




 Did you *really* imagine it?

From Bill Bryson's book, [A Short History of Nearly Everything](http://www.amazon.com/A-Short-History-Nearly-Everything/dp/076790818X) (for geographic reference he is talking about an impact that happened in [Manson, Iowa](http://thewatchers.adorraeli.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IA_66936.gif) some 74 million years ago and left the biggest crater in the US (you couldn't tell if you went there...nothing to see crater-wise anymore without using special equipment to see underground):

An asteroid or comet traveling at cosmic velocities would enter the earth's atmosphere at such a speed that the air beneath it couldn't get out of the way and would be compressed, as in a bicycle pump. As anyone who has used such a pump knows, compressed air grows swiftly hot, and temperature below it would rise to some 60,000 Kelvins or ten times the surface temperature of the Sun. In this instant of its arrival in our atmosphere, everything in the meteor's path - people, houses, factories, cars - would crinkle and vanish like cellophane in a flame.

One second after entering the atmosphere, the meteorite would slam into the earth's surface, where the people of Manson (an impact site of such a collision millions of years ago) had a moment before been going about their business. The meteorite itself would vaporize instantly, but the blast would blow out a thousand cubic kilometers of rock, earth, and superheated gases. Every living thing within 150 miles that hadn't been killed by the heat of entry would now be killed by the blast. Radiating outward at almost the speed of light would be the initial shock wave, sweeping everything before it.

For those outside the zone of immediate devastation, the first inkling of catastrophe would be a flash of blinding light - the brightest ever seen by human eyes - followed an instant to a minute or two later by an apocalyptic sight of unimaginable grandeur: a rolling wall of darkness reaching high into the heavens, filling an entire field of view and traveling at thousands of miles an hour. Its approach would be eerily silent since it would be moving far beyond the speed of sound. Anyone In a tall building in Omaha or Des Moines, say, who chanced to look into the right direction would see a bewildering veil of turmoil followed by instantaneous oblivion.

Within minutes, over an area stretching from Denver to Detroit and encompassing what had been Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, the Twin Cities - the whole of the Midwest, in short - nearly every standing thing would be flattened or on fire, and nearly every living thing would be dead. People up to a thousand miles away would be knocked off their feet and sliced or clobbered by a blizzard of flying projectiles. Beyond a thousand miles the devastation from the blast would gradually diminish.

But that's just the initial shockwave. No one can do more than guess what the associated damage would be, other than that it would be brisk and global. The impact would almost certainly set off a chain of devastating earthquakes. Volcanoes across the world would begin to rumble and spew. Tsunamis would rise up and head devastatingly for distant shores. Within an hour, a cloud of blackness would cover the planet, and burning rock and other debris would be pelting down everywhere, setting much of the planet ablaze. It has been estimated that 1.5 billion people would be dead by the end of first day. The massive disturbances to the ionosphere would knock out communications systems everywhere, so survivors would have no idea what was happening elsewhere or where to turn. It would hardly matter. As one commentator has put it, fleeing would mean "selecting a slow death over a quicker one. The death toll would be very little affected by any plausible relocation effort, since earths ability to support life would be universally diminished."

The amount of soot and floating ash from the impact and following fires would blot out the sun, certainly for months, possibly for years, disrupting growing cycles. In 2001, researchers at the California Institute of Technology analyzed helium isotopes from sediments left from the later KT impact and concluded that it affected earths climate for about 10,000 years. This was actually used as evidence to support the notion that the extinction of dinosaurs was swift and emphatic - and so it was in geological terms. We can only guess how well, or whether, humanity would cope with such an event.

And in all likelihood, this would come without warning, out of a clear sky.

EDIT:  Added geographic info for context.

EDIT2: It is worth noting that there were no extinctions associated with this impact.  As devastating as it was it was still not sufficient to completely end any species' time on the planet.  Now consider what the one that put a sharp and definitive end to the dinosaurs must have been like!
 




 I don't care about art, why would I? I'm not purchasing art again that's something for the rich....and science, wow you came up with cures I cannot afford, and technology which has eliminated millions of jobs to enrich the tiny sneering technical elite

"Art" is a broad term.

Do you read books?  Watch TV?  Go to movies?  Listen to music?  Have you ever appreciated a beautiful photo or painting?

All art and I bet you are a consumer of some if not all of that.

Prosperity means people have time to make that stuff instead of hunting food.  Prosperity means you have time to enjoy some of that stuff.

Your life expectancy is longer than it was in the past due to science.  Hell, even something as simple as salt is iodized and water has fluoride in it both of which improve your overall health (not to mention civil water and sewer systems).

As for technology eliminating jobs it certainly does but that is not always bad.  I remember as a kid that elevators used to have elevator operators.  People who manually controlled the elevators with a lever.

Would you suggest we were better off with manual elevators rather than the automatic ones we have today because some people lost their job running an elevator? 




 Compare yourself to someone from, say, the year 1500.

You are light years better off then they were. 




 It is not about whether others should earn as much.  It is about people striking who earn $150k+ because they feel they don't earn enough.

In the US in the mid 90's professional baseball players went on strike.  They had a hard time mustering sympathy when their average salary was $1.2 million/year. 

I wonder how much competition those tugboats are subject to?
 




 "Anecdotal bad apples"?  It is more than anecdote.

Wonder why there is no accountability for police after they do something egregious?  Ever see how hard it is to get rid of a bad teacher (including criminal teachers) in New York or Chicago?  Ever try to start your own business as a garbage collector?  Ever try to plug in a computer at a trade show without paying $120/hour for a union guy to do it?

The list is long.  

I read The Jungle.  I know of the labor disputes of the early 20th century and the horrid excesses of corporations (literally killing women and children in some cases).  I appreciate the need for workers to collectively bargain.

On the flip side the unions have become monsters in their own right and it is no surprise that people push back against them and they are losing power.

In the end we are the losers and the corporations are winning.
 




 Kinda wondering that myself.
 




 As for us that like unions: no.

Unions are partly their own worst enemies.

In principle they are great.

In practice they have become big business in their own right that are more interested in their own existence than their workers and (sometimes) are dominated by organized crime.

Workers coordinating and uniting to protect their rights is *great*!  But they can create an intolerable mess too.

There has to be a good middle-ground (I am thinking the Germans have a good model for labor relations with management).
 




 Prosperity is good in general (within reason).

Prosperity allows for all sorts of luxuries which can include everything from an iPod to going to an opera (read arts).

The world used to be dominated by growing food.  It is what most people did.  When technology allowed for better returns people became more prosperous and allowed them to try and do new things like science and art.

You may not care that *I* am prosperous but you should be glad for overall prosperity.
 




 AUS $150K is about US $140K.

Cost of living in the US is about 1/3 less than in Australia (on average of course). [SOURCE](http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_countries_result.jsp?country1=Australia country2=United+States)

So an equivalent wage in the US would be around $100K.  That is a fantastic wage in anyone's book.  Most people live on well less than half that.  Hell, $50k is not a bad wage either.  Not rich but not bad.

In 2012 the US average wage was about [$44,000](http://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/AWI.html).  In Australia it is about AUS [$75,500](http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/6302.0).

However you slice it, by any measure, these tugboat crews are doing quite well.  Hard pressed to feel bad about them. 




 I see the sarcasm and it is not lost on me.

More seriously I will add the issue with giving tax breaks and other incentives to create jobs really do not work.

Imagine you can sell 1,000 iPods/month and it takes you five employees to manufacture those 1,000 iPods.  Will a tax break get you to hire more people?

No.  Why would you?  You will hire as many people as you need to get the job done. Period.  If the government lets you keep more money you will not hire more people just cuz...you will pocket that money.

Further, wages stagnate because there are 100 people waiting to take one of those five jobs.  You want more money? Fuck you...Joe Schmo over there tells me he will work for half your salary.
 
























 That's why they were crying. 




  Oh, so that one time 50 years ago? 

[The Ludlow Massacre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludlow_Massacre) jumps to mind.
 









 This is not remotely true. The National Guard has a history of shooting civilians. See Kent State for starters.  




 You're probably right that these bats were fine and posed no danger.

Thing is you can never be 100% certain with wild bats and you only get to be wrong once.  Rabies is some majorly bad juju.  

That said bats are cool and good to have around and kinda neat.  Just best to not mess with them in general.

Glad you relocated them!
 




 Why is this even news?

Countries spy on each other!  News at 11!

Seriously, every country does its level best to spy on other countries be they friend or foe.  No one wants to be caught flat-footed.

There is nothing new about this.

Yes we can get all butt-hurt and righteous when the Israelis or Russians are caught spying on us but none of our governments really get all that bent out of shape about it because they all know that is part of the game.
 




 It doesn't matter if they are far from the same.

In the US Congress they are both right of center, caucus together and vote together as a bloc.

They can argue amongst themselves all they want about the finer points of conservatism and if they ever completely run off liberals our two party system will break along libertarian and non-libertarian lines.

But that is all academic right now and there is no practical reason for a liberal voter to distinguish between the two.
 




 I am not sure which sacking of which city it was by the Mongols but reportedly in one city 60,000 women committed suicide rather than to be raped/captured/killed by the Mongols.

Our modern mind simply cannot encompass such a thing.  Imagine filling a modern football stadium with women and then they all commit suicide.  Boggles the mind.

The really amazing part?  That wasn't even the worst of what the Mongols did.  It was par for the course.
 




 IIRC the Mongols were pretty serious about *not* spilling royal blood.  This did not mean they would not kill royalty.  They most certainly did.  They just found creative ways to do it.
 




 Oh man...there are lots of these.

[This is the worst picture](http://www.newjerseytelephones.com/images/Wiring%20Mess.jpg) of one I have ever seen.

The worst I have ever personally seen was something like [this picture](http://www.vibrant.com/images/cables/artistic-mess-cormacphelan.jpg).

Weird thing though it was easier to change out a cable in the messy room (within reason...not like the first pic) than it is in the nicely bundled and zip-tied neat room.  I have traced cables through both kinds (messy and bundled) and the bundles were a pain in the ass.  You have to unbundle them then find your cable in the bundle then trace it then replace it and make it all neat again.

 




 It honestly looked like the same trick to me over and over again.

I understand I have no clue what I'm looking at but it remains that I doubt this can be really appreciated by anyone outside of the community of skaters.

 I am interested to know if this changes your opinion.

For the sake of argument let's assume Brown did commit the robbery and let's also assume the officer who shot him had no clue about that robbery.

Are you still unconcerned that the officer shot him and killed him?
 




 I am not sure this link will have the info when you go there but this is listed as "Breaking News" on a banner on CNN's website (as of me posting this):

Chief says initial contact between Michael Brown and officer who shot him was unrelated to alleged convenience store robbery. [SOURCE](http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/15/us/missouri-teen-shooting/index.html)

So, even IF Brown did commit a robbery prior to being shot the cop that shot him apparently did not know that.

EDIT:  Here is a screen cap of the linked page in case it the banner gets removed: http://i.imgur.com/vkX8Hv1.jpg
 




 You can sue for being detained for no cause.

Consider a country where any cop could throw anyone in jail for 24 hours then merely shrug and let you go for any reason or no reason whatsoever.

Police most certainly need probable cause to detain you.
 




 Peering is not last mile stuff which would be the "local" portion of Comcast to your house.  

There is nothing inherently stopping breaking up of monopolies at the local level.  They merely tell Comcast that it HAS TO allow others to use their wiring and Comcast would charge a fee for that.

It's been done before and works fine.
 




 When you "delete" a file it goes to your computer's trashcan.  In this case the file is not really deleted.  It's location in the file system merely changes it from the original directory to the trashcan directory.

When you clear your trashcan the file system marks the space the file is located at on the hard drive (or SSD or whatever) as available.  At this point the file is NOT deleted and can be recovered with certain utilities.  Over time other data may be written in that spot and the old file will be unrecoverable.

For this reason there are some utilities that, when you delete a file, write random data into the file's location on the drive eight times.  This thoroughly scrubs the file and makes it truly deleted (apparently, if you have the right tech, it is possible to see what data was in a location even after some other file has overwritten it by the magnetic traces it leaves on the surrounding area...or something...point is writing random data eight times in the same spot ruins even that method and truly makes the data unrecoverable).
 




  This is an asshole cop shooting a guy. Im not setting up a new system here. Im not reforming the courts and laws. I just dont care if these kind of scumbags get shot.
 
 
 
 Don't start going down that rabbit hole and reading too deep into my comments.

Seems pretty clear you are fine with police dispensing summary judgment on anyone who robs a store and ok with them imposing the death penalty for that crime as a just and proper punishment.

Judge, jury and executioner all rolled into one.

When suggesting such things you need to consider how you'd feel if this was done to someone you care for.  Imagine your brother or sister (or best friend) robs a store and a cop rolls up and guns them down.  You'd be ok with that?
 




 The courts broke up Ma Bell and there was no publicly owned anything about it.

Note that where Ma Bell has a monopoly is still in the local markets but not long distance.  It is actually cheaper to call long distance now than it is to call locally.  How do I know?  I work in Chicago and have setup fax systems for companies that do a lot of faxing (mortgage companies are a prime example) and it is cheaper to route the fax via ISP to offices in another state and call back to Chicago than it is to have the suburban location phone downtown Chicago directly).
 




 While that may be prudent it should be noted that it is explicitly illegal for police to search your cell phone without a warrant (Supreme Court unanimous decision in [Riley v. California](http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/riley-v-california/)).

Further, it is explicitly illegal in ALL circumstances to delete video (tampering with evidence).  [Felony charges](https://www.aclu.org/blog/free-speech-criminal-law-reform/hidden-third-cameraman-proves-crucial-nebraska-photographer) have been brought for such things.

Of course you would have to *prove* all this in a court so uploading via Dropbox is still a good idea but it IS at least illegal for the police to mess with your phone without a warrant.
 




 It is a little gray but not as much as you seem to suggest.

 Sue for false arrest. The damages from not getting the job could be substantial. 

Uphill battle I admit but if the officer is never held accountable perhaps the taxpayers will hold their bosses accountable at the ballot box after a few million dollar lawsuits.  




  Can any redditer's here find on line how much money, political donations he gets from Comcast/Time Warner?

By far his biggest contributor is the insurance industry ($116,200).

After that is lawyers and lobbyists but there is no telling what the lobbyists were lobbying for.  If it was ALL for cable it would be $55,118.

Of course this is not current.  No telling what has been promised in the past few weeks.

 In a weird way you kinda did.

Want to crush someone?  Ignore them.  It is far, far more devastating than yelling.  Cool indifference can be brutal and says loud and clear you don't give a fuck. 




 Can we interest you in some solar cells and a satellite dish? Half price for the first year! We accept acorns as payment.  




  It's all talk or at least it has been for 20+ years. I created a research report on nuclear energy for my high school enviro. biology class in 1992, which included mention of these types of reactors. There are still none in mainstream energy production today.

You realize they built an operational one back in the 1960's?

The Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) was an experimental molten-salt nuclear reactor at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) researching this technology through the 1960s; constructed by 1964, it went critical in 1965 and was operated until 1969. [SOURCE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molten-Salt_Reactor_Experiment)

There are also some working today or in the works:

 He wrote 66 of 83 citations so most people who were cited were cited by this one guy. 

That said the article suggests he was citing homeless people so I doubt they will contest these (or pay the fine).  




 I tried for years (literally) to get my GF and (eventually) wife to try sushi.

She'd have none of it.

Then, one day, a close friend of hers from college who she had not seen in a long time was coming through our city but was only in for a night.  She REALLY wanted to see this person!

Her friend told her that she was going to a particular sushi place.  If my GF wanted to see her then that is where she'd have to go.

My GF grumbled but I assured her there would be other items she could eat on offer other than sushi so she figured it was fine to go.

Once there she kinda felt that, in order to be cool, she had to choke down some sushi.  She did and it was a revelation to her.  She freaking LOVED it (kidjanot).

Somehow, after that, she was someone who ALWAYS liked it.  Nevermind the years I had to sneak eating sushi because she would not even abide the sight of it.

All's well that ends well I suppose...

**grumble grumble**
 




 I thought everyone in Chicago knew this song.

I then asked some co-workers (we are all in Chicago) about it and was surprised that none had heard of it.  I was surprised.

Spread the good word! :)
 




 I've lived in Chicago most of my life and have lived on the north side now for 15 years.  This never gets old.  One of the best drives into a major city anywhere in the world (I think THE best).

Have to add the obligatory [Lake Shore Drive song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOrdtmG2IMM)

 




   Name one time a restraining order has saved someone's life.

That's impossible to answer.  A lot of restraining orders have been issued where no one has been killed.  There is no way to know if any of those prevented something worse.

That said I understand if someone is intent on murder a restraining order is small potatoes and not going to be the thing that deters them.
 




 *Brian is writing a slogan on a wall, oblivious to the Roman patrol approaching from behind. The slogan is "ROMANES EUNT DOMUS".*

Centurion: What's this thing? "ROMANES EUNT DOMUS"? "People called Romanes they go the house?" 

Brian: It... it says "Romans go home". 

Centurion: No it doesn't. What's Latin for "Roman"? 

*Brian hesitates*

Centurion: Come on, come on! 

Brian: (uncertain) "ROMANUS". 

Centurion: Goes like? 

Brian: "-ANUS". 

Centurion: Vocative plural of "-ANUS" is? 

Brian: "-ANI". 

Centurion: (takes paintbrush from Brian and paints over) "RO-MA-NI". "EUNT"? What is "EUNT"? 

Brian: "Go". 

Centurion: Conjugate the verb "to go"! 

Brian: "IRE"; "EO", "IS", "IT", "IMUS", "ITIS", "EUNT". 

Centurion: So "EUNT" is ...? 

Brian: Third person plural present indicative, "they go". 

Centurion: But "Romans, go home!" is an order, so you must use the ...?

 If this is [the song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGJmt5HNTTg) you are referring to then they definitely took samples from the song I linked to.

Great songs both.
