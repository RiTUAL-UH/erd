 I think it is a hacked article. 




 This sounds like hacked article. Somebody went on the Reuters website and planted a hacked article. 




 I wonder if people are going to gold on the cheap.

 temecula might be a good idea.  You got the wine country as well plus there is gambling and shows at Pechanga. 




 average for a guy. 




 This guy goes on and on.  The diatribe becomes too repetitive and bore at times.  He lost my interest after about one minute. 




 What evidence does he have?  I doubt that he has any evidence.  The reality is that the money is coming from Saudi Arabia or Egypt. 




 What a sick prick! 




 good shit. 




 We do not need another cigarette taxes.  Cigarettes are taxed too high and people should have the legal right to smoke. 




 That sounds like invasion of privacy. 




 That is going too far.  I mean gun control should be on the table, but banning games is a violation of free speech. 




 The only problem with that theory is that the wealthy are not receiving additional benefits for money paid into the system.  Unlike the income taxes which were designed to be a progressive system, the social security tax is designed to be social insurance program which is based on how much a person's contributes to the program over a period of time and the benefit is proportional to the tax receipts that paid into the system. 

Once the tax has no ceiling on income, it ceases to be a social insurance tax, but rather a form of restricted income tax on the wealthy disguised as a social insurance tax where the tax receipts are creates an encumbrance (restriction) on expenditures to be used to shore up security instead of being appropriated for use in the government general fund. 

In conclusion, raising the ceiling is a form of restricted income tax on the wealthy and is not designed to social insurance for their income.  
 




 Obama has a "fear" of not looking being bi-partisan and just being bold liberal who fights for liberal causes.  He wants to be seen as 
"post-partisan" and is afraid of being tagged as a liberal in his legacy.  Instead, he should embrace the liberal agenda and be like President Johnson who liberal agenda defines him to this day. While Johnson always have the Vietnam War that will tarnish his agenda, Obama should have realized that liberalism will have defined his legacy, and not trying to be post-partisan with this group of Republicans. 




 Administrators did not put enough effort into forecasting the effects of a bubble economy on the city finances.  If the city had made a proper forecast of the housing bubble, perhaps, the effects of the housing recession would not be in effect. 




 There should be a focus in the state legislature to force the communities colleges to identify and eliminate inefficient use of overhead and G A expenses.  




 Impressive Rack. 




 Makes me think twice about drinking and driving. 




 Why cannot we do this nation-wide?  They do this in many European countries.  How about granting a week off for all workers? 




 What a bunch of loons! Do they ever get it? 




 While Hugo Chavez criticisms of US imperial power and help towards the poor was considered to be hallmarks of his legacy, he also leaves behind a a cult of personality that is akin to Mao, Stalin, or Castro.  While Chavez was a far less brutal ruler than Mao or Stalin, he still used a  lot of the same tactics to stamp out the opposition. 




 This is the problem when you keep an artificial ceiling on interest rates for an extended period of time instead of letting the interest rates float. 




 That is a good idea for a single-payer system. Instead of Obama Care, we could have single-payer catastrophic health-care system and have private supplumental surance for the rest of the expenses. 

You never hear about that idea from the left, but it might be the idea that hits the spot.  




 What is the point of the article?  It means that there is massive inequality in the nation and that people are forced to go on food stamps because there is not enough high-paying jobs.   If there was enough high-paying jobs, the need for food stamps would decrease significantly

The reality is that we need to increase wages to get people off entitlement programs and not cut entitlement programs just because people cannot afford food stamps because the jobs that are around are considered to be crap jobs out there.   




 It just goes to show how people will go to any lengths to have the bible justify their position, even though the bible has no prohibitions against interracial marriage (especially in the New Testament which has no prohibitions against interracial marriage) 




 I guess there will be massive exodus of people out of Phoenix one of these days, but I doubt we will see until maybe 2040. 




 Why is is this even a link? 




 Too bad. I was actually looking forward to Ashley Judd running. 




 An interesting idea, but I do think it would work. 




 The thing that I did not get is that Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, and Mike Lee voted against it.  I think it shows that Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, and Rand Paul wanted something more extreme thing that what Paul Ryan proposed. 




 Is anybody suprised here?  He is a neo-conservative that is sheep in clothings.  He is a just another neo-con DINO out there and we are glad to get rid of him. 




 That is a such petty law.  Good job by the Judge.   




 And you got to remember, the House of Representatives is supposed to be the people's house and that is not in the hands of the Dems.  In reality, the people's house belong to the Republican party, like or not and that is based on population.

 




 Wow! Lack of bullets? Maybe cutting a few F-35 fighters from the marine's budgets should give them enough money.   The F-35 is nothing, but a giant fiasco (http://www.allvoices.com/contributed-news/14206240-the-f35-fighter-jet-program-a-world-class-fiasco)
 




 Yet, an another Republican  know-nothing. 




 That is way too much money. 




 Thanks 




 Why does all of our politicans have to pander for AIPAC? It seems that nobody has courage to stand up to them and state that their policies contribute towards creating a hostile environment in the Middle East, and actually hinder the peace process and worsen the security environment for Isreal. 




 Isreal should gets it the across-board cut just like everybody else does.
 




 Finally, some transparency on this issue, but it does not shed light on the operational procedures for drone killings.  Such operational procedures should be discussed in a secret briefing to Congress (for national security purposes), but our lawmakers should know the operational procedures for how a  targeting drone stike is conducted.   




 Thinking that voting is somehow a entitlement is an purely indirect method of hiding one's own view of racial superiority. It suggets that one has an inferior view of poor and uneducated black people having the right to vote.  Do we give white and poor voters and deny them the right to vote? The answer is no.  

The South has infamous documented history of making voting access difficult to racial minorities and other lower-class people.  Therefore, letting the South monitior its own election is liking letting Wall Street police itself.  We know that self-regulation in the end does not exist in places where the environment itself encourages noncomplaince with federal constitutional law.  Therefore, we need to keep the voting protection acts as long as possible.  




 It is time that people learned to step up for themselves and say no to austerity economics.  Once the cuts get bad off, it is time to say "no" to austerity economics. 




 I think the main problem is that he used doomsday language to get the Republicans to sway to vote on more tax increases.  That is not simply possible.  You are going to have to elect more dems because you have to tell and demonstrate the these cuts are actually bad for the economy and you need more revenue to do it.  We actually need to experience a few months of the sequester to really to determine whether it is really harmful for the country.  If it is, than the Republicans lose the political battle and Obama will be proven right.  If not, the GOP will have some talking points for the 2014 campaign. 




 I think his poll numbers are dropping because people are beginning to see that the effects of the sequester will not be as bad as first reported.  People will see that the Republicans are right on spending cuts that the effects of the sequester are overstated (even I though I favor less spending cuts and higher taxes).  Remember, that 50% of the cuts are coming from defense which is something that we need to cut anyways and the GOP (except for some like Rand and Ron Paul) would refuse to cut it prior to the sequester 




 The house is pathetic piece of government. It does not know to how lead the government 




 Nice rack. 




 I would  recommend attending some Al-Anon meetings. They would provide some support and advice for you. Al-Anon is designed for people that have relationships with people in addiction  




 that was motherfucking funny 




 Well, I guess there are some horny 40 years old out there. 




 Time to for Sheriff Joe to resign. 




 So hot! 




 How cute! 




 I guess Germany is not going to have to be a tightwad. 




 They will get the gallows for that 




 Just shows how much Christans ignore their own scriptures when it comes to love and tolerance. 




 They know how to groove. 




 adorable! 




 That is an act of bravery.  




 What a moron. 




 Keep to a three to four a day.  Just do not drink a six pack and end up an alcoholic. 




 All I get is spam with this link. 




 So cute! 




 Should be posted under World News 




 There is no evidence that proves or disproves God existences.  Therefore, it is completly rational to believe in a god.  For example, the complete order and harmony of this universe points towards a creator of infinite intelligence.  However, we do not know its ways or neither we can comprehend it.  There are infinite amount of stars and possibliy a large amount of intelligent life out there that we cannot detect.  We do not know how God has dealt with them.  We are just finite beings with finite capacity to understand the infinite.   I belief strongly in Darwinan evolution, but I also believe that it is strongly possible for it to be power greater than ourselves to exist 




 I do not like it. 




 They know how to fight. 




 Hope you get clean and you get the help that you need to change your life. 




 3 years probabtion and 90 days in the county jail. 




 No, they are not responisble for the  person death.  The person is neligent for believing the claims of the faith healer and is responsible for their health. 




 Nice ass! 




 That is why UPS is far better than USPS.  The only good about the mail is that cheaper than UPS or FedEx. 




 Super PACS.  They do not help build movement conservatism or neither to help elect liberals to office.  They are poison to both parties and so should be banned. 




 Never heard of that before.  If it does exist, it is very obscure passage because I have never heard it any Christian or atheist circles. 




 Yeah! It was failed policy

 




 I should have checked it. 




 Please do not post it.  I consider that to be an offensive remark and I am agnostic.  I have a lot of people that are Christians that have significantly helped me with my life and recovery.  Putting people down's faith is just no no to me because their faith in God has helped my life to be better. 




 Go put Rick Perry go without health insurance for 30 days and then let him to tell you how it much sucked not having insurance.

Seriously, you make blanket statements like that means that you have take action and do what is right.  




 With who? Nobody can run elections in politics until money is removed from politics which is replaced by a surtax on the income tax that specifies that .01-.05% of all taxable income be taxed to fund the Presidential and Congressional elections.

It is not a popular idea but it would generate the amount of revenues required to fund all Presidential and Congressional elections without resorting to big money campaign donations. 




 Pepper spray for nonviolent protestors?  I thought that was only reserved for prisoners in the supermax facility who would be a real threat to guards.

Pepper sprays work goods in prison because it prevents super-max guards for using brutal force, but on a person from Occupy is going too far and should be considered a criminal action and result in a trip to the county jail for the police officers who pepper sprayed the protesters. 




 Orange County Burners.  We are at http://groups.yahoo.com/ocburners.  It is an older group, but we are friendly to everybody. 




 Sorry Fox News  you are bunch of liars.

 They should be monitoring pederasses, thieves, drug dealers who sell hard drugs, and robbers and not wasting taxpayer's resource on the Occupy movements. 




 That is the problem about putting links on the mobile phone sometimes. 




 It is NFSW by accident 




 They are supposed to run a public transportation system and not into become a fascist organization.  Unfortunely, I believe the culture at BART is systemic and this is why Oscar Grant is in a box because BART has not taken dramatic step to rid itself of this culture.

Until BART realizes it is primary purpose is public transit and not law enforcement, you will not see any change in the culture. 




 Maybe that reddit belongs to the cult of I-Phones. 




 The only that I have gone with using the internet in the last few years when I have been at vacation at Burning Man.  My life is so connected to Facebook, Yahoo Groups, and Meetup that I would have a hard time finding and connecting with people.  In addition, I use the internet to attend AA meetings online. 




 There is nothing  that you can do about her alcoholism.  She has to become honest and admit to herself that she is powerless over alcohol.  She has admit that her life is unmanagable and that she needs serious help like an inpatient rehab that deal especially dual diganosis cases. Or she can go to 90 AA meetings in 90 days and get a sponsor. 




 I wish that I could do that, but it made my life unmanageable and therefore, I have to a meeting a day for a long time. 




 I wish that I could use the OC bus system to save on my commute.  I would use if it took 90 minutes to get from Huntington Beach to Mission Viejo,  Sadly, it takes two and half-hours and that shows the sorry state that public transit is on the OC 




 I would personally just left the dope alone. I support Cannabis legalization even though I do not smoke and I am in recovery for alcohol abuse. 




 What a fiasco! I cannot believe Obama has sunk to this point! 




 I would use it to buy some hiking clothes, a backpack for backpacking,  I would also buy some topo maps for places for hike. 




 That is last area that we need to cut.  We need every dollar to spend on climate change and not cut the environmental bills 




 There are some services like garbage that should be outsourced like trash and IT support.  Private contractors do better at some things than public sector does.   And this is coimg from a progressive. 




 Now! That is a bachleor pad that I wanted to go into 




 Why is Obama on this issue?  He should be like Theodore Roosevelt and makes this merger DOA.  Nothing

All Obama has to state that he opposes the merger and that he instruct the FTC to block the merger.  The corporations will then back down and not merge.

Of course, Obama captiluates on everything and therefore, does not have capablity to stop large corporations because he fears them too much. 




 Than perhaps Ron Paul is right and we should eliminate the Fed. 




 Yeah, getting out of drug and alcohol addiction takes hell of lot of effort and humility.  I know! I have to recovery my addiction to alcohol and it takes a lot of effort and time.  A lot of time that could have gone into hobbies and watching TV shows on weekday nights are taken away. 

Yet, it is doable.  I have got sober three times and it is struggle, but is is possible. 




 This  make me sick to my stomach    




 Just what I need!  Congress cannot make a payment on  the debt ceiling and I do not get paid my vacation pay while I was in rehab. 




 Do you live in the OC? 




 If weed does not make your life unmanageable and you are not addict, try to set your weed smoking to a set amount of times a day.  A good advice is to take a toke every five hours on the dot.  It would mean that you smoke three blunts a day and get about 15-17 hours of work done and the weed will help you relax better. 




 yeah she is hot! 




 put it in the gay section or on your local Craigslist MFW casual sex website if you are not gay. 




 What about the problem of teenage unemployment? 




 They are crazy. 




 Sounds like this guy is not rapist, but an alcoholic who needs serious help and needs to admit and accept that he cannot recover alcohol unless he admits total powerless over and that it makes him life unmanageable and he works a program.  As an alternative, he needs to learn to motivate him to abstain and deal with the underlying problems that cause his drugs.  There is multiple paths to soberity, but it depends on how much that he wants it and you do not need an expense rehab to solve it. 




 Trying to pay for it will not help.  You should seriously consider about seeing a dating coach instead of paying money for a hooker.  Or try to see threapist that is skilled in teaching relationship skills.

If you got the money to afford hookers, you got the money to afford professional help that help you to develop social and relationship skills that you lack. 




 Drinking alone was one of most loneliest and depressing things that I did.  I did it for two years and it did not solve my problems.

Maybe it works for you though. 




 Because people are too lazy to change their old, bad habits. 




 It is all about control and fear.     




 Me too 




 Meetup is good way to make friends.  If you are into Burning Man, there is a OC Burner group here locally that gets together. http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/ocburners 




 What happened to shareholders keeping the corporations accountable for operational performance?  Clearly, an incident like this should result in no bonus for failure to achieve concrete operational goals.    




 Even as a US liberal, the government should not the business of making vodka.  Vodka is a private good and therefore, the private sector should have control over the Vodka market. 




 She is a such a douchbag! 




 Nope 




 I do not create an identity on Facebook! It is real me!  I tell people on Facebook that I am recovered alcoholic, agnostic, progressive, Burner, autistic, political junkie, and Chargers Fan.  

I do not pretend to be somebody that I am not. These people are lying to themselves because they live in fear of being themselves. 




 Great! A week of work and I get a claim of week of unemployment! Woo hoo! 




 Well, if they want to make peace with the stubborn Isrealis, than Hamas has to go.  




 Are they ever going to give up fighting the people of Gaza? Has enough blood been shed there. 




 The lesson is that you have to get that perfect buzz to make the best music. 




 Probably good old Southern Baptist 




 If you want to get rid of birthright citizenship, than the GOP also need includes a clause that include langauge that get rids of corporations as people.  Than you got your deal. 




 Your are glad that you never have to inside the Maricopa County Jail. 




 Just enjoy a quiet beer to yourself or you intend to get drunk? 




 I would lose in that game. I have zero hand-eye coordination and so that prevents me from getting addicted to video games. 




 Nope, there is the Log Cabin Republicans which are gay conservatives. Most of them favor free-market capitalism over the regulation of capital markets that Dems favor. 




 The Republicans better be careful because this stratergy could really backfire.  




 Obama will veto it. 




 What an arrogant SOB!  




 I still read old media, but I use my computer or phone to read it.  




 California cannot have a budget deficit and therefore, California is experiencing massive spending cuts. The federal government does not and therefore, not need to. Theortic ally,  it can run a deficit into eternity as long it pays the debt service cost.
 




 Just use Google Docs and use the spreadsheet function  It has portable operability because it is web-based and you do not have to Microsoft Office license to operate it. 




 There is always Afghanistan.  It is supposed to have tons of lithium. 




 There is called one problem that we have in the United States that prevent us from doing that: a massive budget deficit. 




 Your are normal toker!  People that smoke a ton of bowls every day are addicts just like alcoholics.  Unless your smoke a ton of bowls every day, continue to smoke!  The people that smokes a ton of bowls every day need to quit because their are addicts and need to abstain from use of weed. 




 I am the same way.  I like being alone for extended times, but I like going to large-scale parties.  I find it easier to mingle with people at large parties than spend significant time with somebody with one on one.  That is odd for somebody who have high-functioning autism, but that is what my social skills training good for. 




 You have no friends?  I recommend go to Meetup.com and look for a Meetup that is centered around your interests.  OC has tons of meetups.

 




 You might want to examine whether it was the result of your own making.   You might want to look into the flaws that causes the break-up of the relations.  If your self-examination discloses no findings or flaws, that she just had flaws that she needed to work and it was too difficult, given her flaws, to maintain a serious relationship with the member of the opposite sex.

You can only keep your side of street honest.  You cannot change people or control their actions.  Being rigiorously honest with oneself is the key thing to ensure honest relations with the other sex. 




 I got OCD and autism and I already addicted to Reddit.  The other webstie that I spend way too much on Google News. 




 35 




 My only criticism of the video is that they did not have some smoking hot babe as the police officer.  Than she spank you and call you a bad boy. 




 LOL 




 Yep, having a car is important.  More important is the ability to have a relationship and have excellent social skills. 




 What is the threat? Iran? 




 Now that is nation full of morons. 




 Join a credit union.  My credit union never charges me when I have enough funds. 




 I would rather have Bloomberg as President over any of the nitwit Republican any day of the week.  He might favor the plutocrats, but he does know have to govern and has good leadership skills. 




 No, that it is impossiblity. 




 The real lesson is how teach to people to have long-term soberity and quality soberity.  We do not want have the bad type of soberity like George Bush does. 




 Not all TV is bad.  There is the Science Channel, The History Channel, and other stuff.  Of course, Stewart and Cobert as well.
 




 She needs a giant hug and be told that her is okay.  Living self-pity is solution that leads to addiction.  Learn gratitude!  The key to this problem is self-acceptance.  She needs to accept for the person that she is and that by working on herself, she can work on her character flaws.

She needs to learn that perfectionism is not the goal.  It is progress in our self-development and not perfection.

 




 That was funny 




 This is an cause and the effect error.  Your reasoning suggests that people will do daring acts because the government will pick up the tab for the health care.  The reality is that this is a coincidence.

A lot of people do dangerous acts in the United States and take the risk even though they do not health insurance. 




 Yuck! That is gross 




 Yeah, I work for the man.  The military-industrial complex itself. 




 Most Americans will never watch it. 




 The reality is that most people are paying federal income taxes through payroll withholds on their payroll checks.  In most cases, there is was more money withheld on the payroll check than the actual tax liability.  This result is in a refund check and therefore, it appears that the person had paid no federal income tax, but in reality it is just a check for the excessive withholds on the payroll check. 




 Rush has not done a through 4th step in years.  Needs to write down that list of those people who he resents and the reasons for resenting those people. 




 This is all about net neturality issue. 




 On Healthcare = The Government is not going far enough on that issue.  There should be a robust public option competing aganist private insurance companies
On Education =  Repeal No Child Left Behind and let local school boards control the curriculum 




 Glen Beck will like George Soros being gone.  Of course, Beck is using Soros as a scapegoat because he does not want really debate policy issues. 




 It is lack of people knowing the proper media resources. Most people are low-information voters and do not about the rich treasure trove of progressive media out there.

I consider myself to be a high-information voter and therefore, I know all of the major conservative and progressive blogs. 




 I do not think so. 




 I voted for it, even though it should have been part of a massive prison reform and controlled substance reform act. 




 Go to Google News and type site:ft.com and Gideon.  That is how you get access to the article 




 That was good video 




 That is funny 




 Hmmm.  You could a mobilizer site like Baresite to get around the filter.   




 It sounds like a good show. 




 I am at home watching the rally, but I have to clean out my car and take it to the car wash. 




 This is fucking sweet 




 I do not why the mass populace is voting for the Republican party.  I think that these people place too much reliance on talk radio, Drudge Report, and Fox News.

In my neck of the woods, I have Pacifica, KPCC,  and KTLK 1150 AM. I also read the OC Register which climate change denier paper, but my news analysis comes from Thom Hartmann and Pacifica and therefore, I will not vote for Republicans based on the information that was dissesmated.  People that listen to conservative get half-truths most of the time.  At times, Beck and his ilk are partially right, but they distort the rest of the story which creates a half-truth.

Our voters rely on half-truth equate it with truth and therefore, will vote Republicans because of their inablity to listen to diverse news sources. 




 I would rather go to war and they would put me all day on working on intelligence gathering via computers.

Prison? Forget it? The gangs would rape me. 




 and they have no clue about that there are serving the corporations. 




 And the tea baggers are being taken advantage of. 




 Me too. I am Reddit when I should be learning dance steps. 




 It does not go far enough. Vote No on Prop 19.  Wait until 2014 for the California Prison Reform   Control Substance Act  




 Your are sick fucker. 




 Out of my friends that are Christians, they actually read it and know it quite well..  But my friends are exceptions to the rule. 




 And most of the people who watch it are bunch of dumbasses.  Go on Topix and you find a bunch of people who agree with Fix News.

I listen to Pacifica and MSNBC for the commentary on the news and I rely on Google News for getting the headlines. 




 I think you submitted the wrong link 




 I am going to vote no.  Why? I have better solution to Prop 19 and my problem solves the California Prison Crisies. 




 He should have the golden light and quit.  Heroin is serious drug that should not be messed with.

My friends use drugs, but they stay away from heroin, crack, and meth.  Most of them are not addicts and use drugs safely.  Those drugs can kill and rob lives.

 




 Who cares about what Bill O thinks?  He wants the US return back to the 1950s again.

Which was a more prosperous time in this country, but a time where intolerance and social conservatism were far more widespread than today.  And, yes being an atheist was far more frowned on than it is today. 




 How was the trip? 




 I do not get that 




 Maybe they are actually showing Christian forgiveness which is the message of the gospel . 




 A lot of pastors in the church would agree with you on that subject.   This is the problem that the church is trying to tackle

 Yeah! You need the program my friend.  Time to quit! And it can be done without God because I do not believe in God and I got 21 months! Plus I went to Burning Man at least once without drinking.

So the party is not over just because you cannot drink any more! Matter, fact, it might justh has began.

 If you look at the UK Royal Mail and Canada Post, there is a huge privatization scheme in both countries.  However, the privatization schemes are the direct results when you get conservatives to rule.  

The people who live in rural areas have to most lose if the post office get privatized because the corporations will significantly increase the price of rural deliveries.  And I read somewhere that UPS and Fed Ex rely on the postal service to deliver in some remote rural areas because it is out of UPS and Fed-Ex's area of service.  




 Steve Stockman makes Jon Cornyn look like a progressive. 




 He should be charged with 4 counts of involuntary manslaughter. 




 Yeah, he was definitely scandalous.

 Success in blogging really depends on profession and issue.  If I had a CPA license, I could blog about tax issues and perhaps, that would get me a  job with a local CPA firm if I talked about my blog.  Since my specialty requires a clean criminal background and I do not have clean criminal background, it really difficult to use blogging to get a job. 




 Okay, how about this? Go talk to your conservative neighbors if you live in GOP district ( I am registered to vote in GOP district in Cali, but I live in a Dem house district in Cali)  and ask them why they support this GOP obstructionism? Ask them whether it does the country any good? 




 Congressional idiots won't extend unemployment benefits for another 3 Months! That means that I will have line up with the boys at Labor Ready or take a telemarketing job. Ugh!

 That was bad! Real Bad! 




 This is a travesty of justice.  She should gotten fiveteen years in prison for her crime. 




 I think the article is bit misleading because a lot of people that I know have not replaced watching TV for different hobbies.  I think people have switched to watching videos online as part of Netflix, Hulu Plus, and Bitorrent (which is illegal).  Also, people use DVRs now and watch TV at later dates.  The Nielsen ratings do not capture these statistics and therefore, they are understating how many people are actually watching broadcast or cable TV. 




 It is probably because it is now legal, so cops are going to look for it more often.  The cops are probably expecting that there will be spike in the recreational use of the drug because it is easier to access now.

 Why are people fighting to get the death penalty when the death penalty is name only in California? I just do not get it. 




 I do not like all of the social conservative talk.  I personally favor same-sex marriage and I hate all of the "family value" when it comes to homophobia especially when same sex couples are trying to form family units that the social conservatives value.

I can totally understanding when it comes to abortion when abortion is considered to be "abortion of convenience" and there is real no health justification for it.  I am beginning to oppose abortion in all cases where it is considered to be a "abortion of convenience" instead of health reasons or the women has drastic circumstances that make her to get an abortion. I am pro-choice but only for health cases or the mother is dire circumstances where having a child is not considered to be a feasible option.

 Even though he did the right thing.  It is still a major felony to illegal use your credentials to access information that you did not have access to. 




 I am sorry, that makes his crime a felony.

 The reality is that market does not "self-correct". It takes both investment from both the government and private sector to grow business.  

How is the private sector supposed to "self-correct" a horrendous labor participation rate?  If the market was to "self-correct" the labor participation rate, we would still see significant downward pressure on wages which would lead to greater inequity in the economy.  Greater inequity in the economy eventually leads to reduced consumer spending .  It is all a vicious cycle that will not end until we do something about income inequality.  Until the government changes the tax laws to incentivize companies from stopping hoarding cash, you are not going to see any future investment  




 That is invasive form of privacy violation.

 If the bus runs later than 15 minutes, than you need to find an oral complaint with the OCTA about that specific route coming late. If runs more than 15 minute late three times in a month, then you need to file a formal written complaint. with the OCTA.  If it runs more than five times late in a month, then you need to physically appear at the next OCTA board of directors meeting and write a formal written letter to the OC Register about the bus system running late.  (And believe the OC Register is willing take to report any story about the governmental inefficiency) 




 I hate the route 43 bus going south at night. It is always damn late.  Also, the 56 can be also infamously late if you take it certain times at night. 




 Maybe you should go to NA before you decide to get some pussy. There is a lot of personal flaws within you that the steps would clean up.

 Look, the Greek government has  a terrible record on tax collection. Seizing private property is merely a way from them to collect the unpaid tax revenue from wealthy private individuals.  Part of the reason why the Greek government is in so much debt is because the government has a horrible rate of collecting taxes from private individuals and governments. 




 It seems there is a never ending struggle with the Muslim Brotherhood and the Egyptian government.  The government just has no idea had to legislate a free speech law that allow the Muslim Brotherhood to have  press freedom, but also properly restricts their activities in order to protect the Egyptian national security interests of the government.

 Creepy 




 It is her failure to understand the consequences of her disease and failure to seek out. I think one of the major issues that should have been brought up at sentences was whether there was attempts to get her into a treatment program. If the evidence shows that nobody personally intervened to get her into treatment, this would be a major migitation factor. Once an alcoholic has been offered the opportunity to get treatment, the responsibility is on them to get treatment. It is also their job to remain sober. However, untreated alcoholism without the chance of treatment to me is a considered to be a major migitating circumstance on a criminal case 




 This is considered to be a torture and deserves a life sentence. 




 Good idea. It would be good to have somebody to clean up the county jail mess.

 I hope she wins, but it is long shot.  It depends how much of the vote that she can get from the Latino, African-American votes, and young, white voters.  If these groups turn out in high numbers despite Texas voter ID laws, she has a possible shot of winning. She needs to focus on these groups than trying to win the middle-class and upper-class white votes.  In Texas, winning a majority of white vote for a Dem is  just not to going to happen for a long, long time.

 He draws his (very small market) from using resentful language towards the conservative right.  Just like Savage does except for Savage gets a far bigger audience than Malloy gets because conservative talk radio appeals towards far more people and is more fiscally viable than left-wing talk radio.   




 For conservatives, Mike Malloy is the Michael Savage of the left.  He takes no prisoners and makes no compromises with conservatives.  Michael Savage is just as bad as Malloy.

 Look I am white guy that has lived or goes through Santa Ana almost every day. I shop at the local Walmart over Harbor and McFadden.  I use to live off Euclid and First and go downtown all the time.

Never once I was threated.  Sure, my phone was stolen when I left it on the bus, however, that would be expected in any major urban portion of the OC where people are struggling.

Personally, I believe that most of the danger is largely dependent on who associate with Santa Ana.  If you associate or family with gang-bangers or drug-users, you should expect your fair share of violence.  However, it is my  experience that there is little violence as long you do not associate with gangbangers. 




 If you read the Republican talking points, you hear about them bringing insurance across state lines.  Yeah, like letting big healthcare companies move their insurance to the least regulated states.  That is such a dumb idea. 




 They also have gone after Bank of America pretty bad as well. But nobody has gone to jail for the financial crisis? My question:why? 




 Why cannot the principles of free market be used?  




 Kinda of dumb. 




 I just think Common Core is a stupid approach to take away the individual district's ability to design and make the lesson plan to wishes of the voters.   




 Why is this nation try limit free speech? Please.  Most people who support gun rights are not criminals and do not want go out kill massive amounts of people.  It is the insane people who are the people that ruins the right of legitimate gun owners. 




 So you want violent criminals to get out less than 85% time served?  That is major driver in why offenders stay in jail so long.

 I think that Obama is getting a lot of pressure from the neo-conservative camp to do something on Syria and he wants to follow Clinton's footsteps in terms of limited intervention in foreign entanglements where whole-scale massacres of innocent people.  However, the Iraq War has permanently discredited the US use of force in foreign entanglements even the if the use of force was limited.  If Obama wanted to truly intervene the proper way, he should have gave arms to rebels a long time ago and sent special forces as advisors for training the rebels. I think that is better use of military resources than limited strikes that could potential escalate the war. 




 That is just the military zealots try to agree on a policy that is fail to implement.  I am sorry, but the Iraq War now has limited this type of intervention because you fools screwed up in Iraq and the inherent risk of the US bungling up another major operation is too high compared to have the benefit of what effect to Assad that it would have. 




 We need to allow property owners to fully compensated for their property.  The government is not trying to save the land for environmental reasons, but rather it trying to use the land for border protection. In those cases, the government shall compensate the owner of the land at least 50% of the assessed property's value. 




 Do these goons every understand the concept of "privacy" in international affairs?  It just seems all they snoop around in other people's business and do not allow foreign governments to act in privacy especially when their actions do not result in a national security threat to the US. 




 When I was working the government, they did not state that you needed take a drug test and that was DOD about eleven years ago.  However, I am not sure whether your organization would drug test as part of that individual organization's policy for drug testing.  However,  a public trust clearance does ask you whether you used dope within the last seven years as part of the questionnaire.  You could always and get away with it, but part of the reason that they put you through the background check is to verify your honesty.

 There are plenty ways to learn how to hustle.  You just have to have the willingness to do so.

Hustling in this case means hustlings to get a job in your profession which means you try to sell yourself to other people within your profession even if it is technical field.

I do not hustle for jobs because I am a little bit fearful, too hesistant and I got to deal with my recovery as well.  In addition, I have to rely on the bus system (which is fairly reliable where I live, but takes a long time to get around on).  I am starting to realize that I have to hustle for a job, but I have to break my fear and willin

 Personally, I knew people who in my social network who spew anti-Obama stuff, but I personally are wonderful and very nice people.  A lot of Christians that I know are very spiritual and really love God with all of their hearts.

I think that the media poisons the debate and makes charactures out of both liberals and conservatives.  Unless you know people personally really well that hold those views, sometimes the sterotype persists especially when you spend all of our time hanging out with one type of people.

People follow the echo chamber so much (including myself) and do not realize that reality is far different than the echo chamber that exists on the left.  Not all of right-wing and left-wing talk hosts reflect the craziness.  There is a lot of thoughtful conservative talk radio hosts (like Michael Medev) or Thom Hartmann who is a liberal talk show host.  I think Rachel Maddow and Chris Hayes are very thoughful people as well. 

Not everybody that you hear on the radio is bombastic, but the people are the bombastic tend to drive the highest ratings and advertising dollars.  The funny is that the most crazy guy on the left, Mike Malloy, gets rejected even though Mike Malloy is often right.
 




 I do not understand why people learn to calm down and not have resentment.  As a member of UU, I might disagree with the FRC policies, but the people of the FRC are people with families and love our country.

 Why do you have to judge somebody just because the person like booze? Not everybody that loves to drink has a problem with booze.  Instead, AA tells us that we should not judge people on whether they want to drink or not. 




 This belong in -news seciton. 




 If I were a judge, I would throw out the case and state it was excessive sentencing because the offender did not engage in the production of child porn.  Since the counts only involved the viewing of child pornography without any prior offenses, the sentence is unjustfied and the person needs to be sentenced to a term of years not to exceed 20 years and subject to lifetime supervision as a sex offender. 




 He should be jailed 25 to Life for his crime. 




 The Supreme Leader just wants a stooge to be in power and he cannot tolerate any dissent even it was from a fellow conservative zealot. 




 Well, flooding the market with inflated money will have its consequences.  Bernarke did it at moderate pace and therefore, we have not seen the effects of the tidal wave yet, but Japan might reap the consequences of excessive liquidity in the market.

 Why is adultery is still a crime? 




 These are the same people who try to pass a law that it made it easier to increase the influence of religion over the government. 




 If the victims want truth-in-sentencing, develop a state sentencing commission and then create significantly lower sentences for all crimes except for child rape, aggravated forcible rape, and first-degree murder.  Offenders would only get 15%-25% off their sentences and  victims would know exactly how long the offender is serving in prison without seeing a huge increase in overcrowding because stiff sentencing requirements.  In addition, people that commit serious violent habitual felonies more than two times are locked on life sentence without parole subject to governor's ability to commute the sentence to a terms of years if the prisoner shows extraordinary merit and rehabilitation of mind,body, and soul 




 There is needs to be a state-wide law prohibiting cities from shutting down dispensaries.  Until the state creates mandatory requirements from each city in terms of regulating dispensaries, this issue will keeping going on.  It comes to unfounded fear about crime and illegal activity.  Cops should stop raiding marijuana facilties and instead of spending time trying to bust people who drive stoned.  The fact is that you should right to smoke unless you get behind a wheel and cause an accident.  Driving while impaired is far bigger problem than people just trying to smoke to relieve some tension or pain in their body.

 The OC/LBC area.  The only problem is that housing costs are real expensive. Otherwise, OC is far more cleaner than LA and has plenty of good shopping centers (especially Fashion Island and South Coast Plaza) . Plus the best beaches in Socal.

 If she wants to continue in rehab, she should be taking Tanex which is alternative to adderall.  Believe me I was hooked on adderall for years, but I went on Tanex and no longer was hooked.  All rehabs and sober living approve that drug and does provide a mild buzz especially at 2MG and 3MG. 




 Nice bong. 




 Why should they even care?  If they are covered and shielded their nudity away from the bible-thumpers, they should not care.  The reality is that people need to get over trying to impose their morality on external forces that they do not control or have no harm to.

 I watch the entire story on the local TV news and the guy who filmed the beating stated that cop clearly used excessive force. 




 I think the local DA needs to charge the guy with Assault with Deadly Weapon (his hands) just to show to Cops that they cannot use excessive force.  




 Are they trying to set up a defense for "Not Guilty Due to Insanity" or trying to getting a mitigating circumstance to prevent the prosecutors from using the death penalty

Or is this case to charge her with involuntary manslaugher and get a twelve year jail term instead of life without parole.  Even if they reduced to second degree murder, she would still have to do 45 to life on the term. 




 I wonder if that person helped the NSA with some its nefarious activities. 




 I just find that sentenced to be a little stiff for my tastes.  He would have to produce a lot of images like (400-1000) to get that many years.  He should have gone 25 years instead which is still a stiff sentence but more in align with the crime. 




 It is their problem. Our social welfare system cannot handle them. 




 Why would we ever want to vote on that dreaded bill again. 




 The only way that I state "Yes" to this is that Fox News misinforms a large percentage of people on bad policy when it comes to environmental policy.  Since a large percentage of the Fox News viewer is misinformed on environmental policy, Republican politicians do not get significant pressure from their constituency to change environmental policy 




 What were the results? 




 Personally, I do not see it as offensive.  Only when the "God" means the God of fundamentalists do I cringe. 




 She is just like any othe ex-politico making money.  There is a huge market because everybody wants to know her opinion and analysis on things and therefore, she can command that type of dollars. Look at Clinton, Newt, Condi, or even the sociopath Cheney and they get big bucks for making speeches.  And Obama? He will get ton of money when he leaves office. 




 So is the GOP going to use this a fodder for blaming the Obama administration for making thee economy worse than it actually is 




 The real question is that removing money is going to desired effects that liberals want which is a more progressive government. Or is it really going not to have any effect because the wealthy and powerful will find other ways to influence government without using direct campaign donations. 




 Totally agreed, this is a travesty of justice especially knowing that she was a raised a Christian.

 True Libertarians are Ron Paul or Gary Johnson.  Note: They do not believe that LGBT people should be stoned.

 This stuff makes me gnash with me because it could be me.  Drinking and driving is the one of the reasons why I have to practice my recovery program harder or else I will be that driver. 




 I have not believed a single word of the IRS scandal.  However, this makes me suspicious.  Documents just do not "missing" unless there is something to hid.  The Obama administration should provide these documents so they shut up the GOP.  However, it seems the opposite thing is happening and so maybe there is more than meet the eye on this issue. 




 There is a really good place off Harbor and Banner that offers $7 hair cuts that are real good and cheap.

 Good video. 




 That is Japan is much more densely populated than the US. Yes, California has areas that extremely high density but there is huge distances of very sporadicaly populated where building a train would be inefficient. 




 Just end halt the railroad.  It is money pit headed towards nowhere. High speed rail works far better on the east coast. 




 Mile Square Park would have better location for those people who live in Central OC/North OC. (The 37, 35, 72, 66, and 70 run more frequently than the 87 and 90 does). 




 That area has terrible bus service.  The bus does run there but it only runs like every 80 minutes for both the 87 and 90. 




 Great, just what we need another military ramp up.

 There needs to be a serious rewrite of rules regarding the application of use of force by police officers.  Any unauthorized use of force beyond that the proper rules of engagement can result in felony prosecution.  Once you get start jailing cops on mass for excessive force, than you will see these type of incidents.

If I were a prosecutor, I would have zero tolerance for this behavior especially if there is no real or perceived threat engaged by the officer.  The officer should be charged with misdemeanor assault.  He should not lose his job, but he will have a misdemeanor on his record for assault. 




 What about the concept of separation of Church and State. 




 beauty. 




 There is no such connection.  The guy is not even Christian at all.  There is a lot of patriarchal religions other than Christianity where the male is supposed to be the dominant head of the family.  This exists in almost of all traditional society where gender equality has started to be occur in the recent eras.   




 Maybe we should learn not to trust Iran ever, but to exercise extreme professional skepticism about Iran.  War is not option, but skilled, skeptical diplomacy is the key. 




 Why would people want that creep to represent them? Or maybe, he is a such creep that he makes $$$ on bad lawsuits.   




 You never really predict or you can prevent these events.  These are people are pure psychopaths and evil and this stuff cannot happen.  The only thing that you can really do is ban all firearms, but how much with this actually prevent these massive casualties.  




 The US fails to calculate the human cost of its military inventions and other indirect intervention.  If an external cost was placed on the cost estimate for each foreign incursion, the US would find out that its budgets are too high and would scale back on foreign intervention.  




 It will be impossible to get to 350 PPM at the current state of politics.  With the EU going to the far right and the US trapped with a far right House of Representatives, there is a little hope of ever getting to 350 PPM.

 The real solution is provide better individual training to job counselors,  




 In my job market, I am beginning to partially "give up" my job search.  There is enough work at my local Labor Ready to get at least 32-40 hours a work.  Yes, it is grunt work, but at least there is work.

Most of the problem with people "giving up" exist in small labor markets with limited job opportunities in very limited jobs.  There is only so many grunt jobs/minimum wage jobs to go around.

The flaw in the Republican thinking about not extending benefits is to understand the job markets where there is abundance of low-wage jobs that are easy to get and job markets where there is limited low-wage jobs and there is huge competition for those jobs.

The other issue is that most one-stops center job counselors lack the proper training to teach job-searchers proper job search strategy.  Most of people need to taught how to network outside their comfort zone and how to develop large contacts of people.  The one-stop center really lack the in-depth training to use these resources. 




 Great freestyling there! 




 It was too high. It should be about $12.00 an hour which is much more reasonable minimum wage given the country's cost of living. 




 Awesome! 




 Beautiful! 




 Dumb, but kinda funny. I have seen a lot worse than this  




 Be on Reddit of course 




 How about cutting some dollars from the prison budget and bring parole to all offenders unless they commit a serious sexual offense or first degree murder.   




 Tax credits are big wasted of money is a lot of circumstances. 




 Right-Wing Bigots. 




 Rich assholes. 




 Seems like fodder for the NDP in upcoming elections.  Maybe Steven Harper's policies are actually showing signs of faltering. 




 I wonder what this guy is going to do to his prison cellie if he talks too much.   




 I better this a lot of people who are going to miss get high with that amount of dope. 




 There is incredibly stupid idea in California because people drive ridiculous commutes just to work for a job.  Not everybody has the ability to pick up where they live and relocate within five miles of their job.

I can do that especially in an area of abundance of recovery homes until I find a room to rent.  Not everybody can relocate very quickly and very fast.  And a lot of people do not want to move away from their families and friends just to live near where they work just to avoid to paying a tax. 




 Like deregulation and lowering tax rates is going to improving things.  That might increase corporate funds, but it will funnel either back to repurchasing stock or issuing more dividends to stockholders. 




 The real issues are not Benghazi, the IRS, or the Fast and the Furious. It is really the drone issue which is the real travesty of justice committed by the Obama administration. 




 People that habitual drunk driving laws should be subject to felony convictions if they commit at least four drunk driving charges in ten years.  Once they get more than four DUIs in ten year, each subsequent DUI is a felony.  Eventually, the subject offenders will get nailed by the habitual offender laws in their states and will face stiff jail time (like 15+ years in jail for DUI).  If a person commits habitual DUIs over a long period of time, but does not commit four in a ten year window, should not subject to be a felony law. 




 Like 1991? 




 Please tell me that we need more patriarchy in this country.  That is all what these "prayer rallies" are all about.  




 This is way too long to plot to kill somebody. Doing that is just way to throw your life in a heartbeat. 




 Everytime that I have to read one of these stories is less one reason for to drink again.  Just reading these stories is enough for me not to drink again. 




 Why this guy only doing 12 years on a murder charge. The guy should eventually get out, but not until doing at least 25-35 years in jail. 




 Maybe, it is time to quit. 




 Maybe, we should actually investigate as preventive issue. I think the Republicans should stop looking at the past so much and focus on more what can be done to improve border security.  The blame game with Benghazi should be over by now because the scandal is two years old and any future effort should be focus on improving diplomatic security in the future and any further investigation into Benghazi should be going forwrd. 




 This is absolutely horrible. I would give the guy 22 years for this. 




 They are moving to be closer to their manufacturing facilities in the South .  This is very similar when Boeing moved to Chicago to be closer to the defense manufacturing facilities in St. Louis and also be closer to DC for lobbying purposes. Northrop Grumman did the same thing in Southern California. 

Taxes are a secondary reason for the move.  It is a just a secondary benefit to the problem. 




 The problem is that places like Texas encourage America to have a run for the bottom.  People like Rick Perry do not even realize that they are allowing the corporate vampires to create a race to the bottom by making all of these business go to places where they score cheaper labor and bad regulations instead of making their regulations similar to California. However, they are so dumb and beholden to the dollar, that they do not realize that they are not helping the their own citizens. 




 How is Robocop is going to more efficient at catching the bad guys than humans are? 




 Has anybody look at the old tests that they give eighth grades back in 1912? I bet your average twelfth graders could not even pass that. 




 The stupid library and the Anaheim Work Center all use Internet Explorer. It is the government that likes to use Internet Explorer. 




 A easy Hilary Clinton blowout for sure.
 




 That is so sad, but some people just lack the coping skills to handle surprise rejection. 




 Maybe Christie is finally going to jail. 




 I went to treatment and built a strong support network. I also moved to a sober living. My story is a little bit complicated because of several major relapses and two duis. But I finally got year clean. Also, do not hang out friends who chronically smoke weed and stay way from friends who recreationally smoke until you got one year clean and are not triggered in any form by people who smoke on front of you.  




 Or better yet, pass out on the floor. 




 Throw up. 




 Since I am in recovery, I can relocated very easily and very quickly. 




 The cost of living is very high in LA and it has hard to find a place to live quickly unless you are in recovery.  The best way is to fake that you are in recovery and you will find it a lot faster to find housing cheaply. When you are in recovery, it is very easy to find cheap places to live that offer weekly rentals compared to living in a hotel that will be very expensive and unaffordable at that wage. 




 Unless the job is a job that is going to give a foothold into a industry (such as entertainment) that is around in Southern California or the employer will have a lot of contacts for future employment in that industry, I would say no. 




 Jail them for life without parole.  They are bunch of real creeps that need locked in the SHU and left to rot there for the rest of their life. 




 Please? Do not come here.  You are not welcomed. 




 American States Utitilies is a company to look at. 




 I think it is overgeneralization. However, some of those guys are linked to fringe right-wing sights, not your are typical wise-use supporters like Bundy is.  They are not terrorists, but rather people that are sketchy and unbalanced.

The other people just believe in the rights of landowners over the rights of the federal government.  In reality, this is over very different interpretations of the constitution and not people who are considered to be domestic terrorists.  




 In some places, it might. It might also inspire some gun nuts to accidentely kill somebody.

Concealed-carry laws should require strict background checks and risk assessments for the reason for having them.  There is needs to be a good, justifiable reason why you should the right to carry loaded gun in public concealed. 




 So the local news is going to replace the paper.  Who is going to report on the local news once the OC Register.  There is no local cable news network that dedicates itself to local coverage.

 




 Why would anybody vote that bill? 




 The answer to that question is "No" although I prefer him to Chris Christie or Ted Cruz. Rand Paul is better candidate than Ted Cruz/Chris Christie, but I think that he would dismantle too many government programs. 




 Try to post the link to City-Data which is another forum that deals area-specific issues.  Topix is another but that site is loaded with right-wing nutjobs . 




 Yes, that sounds pretty fishy to me.  Have you checked a premium support calculator yet? 




 So is going to work at place like Labor Ready a good idea for the long-term unemployed at this point even though they are very highly-skilled labor? 




 There is always LaborReady. Yes, I might do that (not because I running out of money), but I have to start working soon (at any job). 




 Orange County is doing very well economically.  Just remember to live in North OC to avoid high rent costs.  The best area is the border between Garden Grove/Westminster to avoid getting nailed on high rent costs. 




 Usually two interviews for all of the jobs that I have gotten. 




 I have never had Craigslist lied about salary, but for accounting and finance openings on Craigslist, companies are usually for real and not shady. 




 He will got some serious prison time for this.  He will least at get five years for this crime as stated in Georiga Code Section No. 16-5-70 (http://law.justia.com/codes/georgia/2010/title-16/chapter-5/article-5/16-5-70/) 




 The GOP is going to have a field day with these scandals. 




 It is all of those federal dollar is why prisoners are overclogged.  If the states did not receive all of the dollars in the 1990s, the states would have not adopted such draconian truth-in-sentencing laws.  




 I would to work in the FBI and go after corporate crooks at Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and JP Morgan.  That would be sole mission if I was in charge of FBI instead of chasing nonexistent terror threats. 




 Flipping over in my car on second DUI. Could have killed somebody and gotten 15 years to life.  That was scary. 




 Get drunk at work and drive home.  Got second DUI in three months and never drove since. 




 Nope because it based on chemicals that weave thoughts based on prior memories and things from senses. 




 The devil. 




 Why should let some foreign power control the Internet? Do really want the EU to control it? 




 Yeah, Single Payer will not happen any time soon because the GOP is going to get the Senate back in 2014.  




 I hope they do not schedule it during rush hour.  That would be insane knowing how bad the I-405 south gets.  




 Is this is a prelude to war? 




 I doubt that there is anything that the US can do. 




 Call my friend's business called Traffic Tax Services at (714) 603-2343.  For more details, please go to (http://www.trafficticketfixers.com/).

He advertises a 90% success rate, but I am not sure that if it accurate. Still, the method that he uses will significantly reduce the chance of getting conviction.. (Note: This business is legit). 




 Cashiers. 




 What an ass. 




 Great! This sounds like a flop. 




 Bitcoins are no good. 




 Another dumb move by the GOP. 




 This is where they could nail bush
"2340A. Torture

 2 DUIs in a year.  Top that. 




 My mom. 




 Yeah, but the Supreme Court would block such lawsuits. 




 Hmm. I had little issue with Kaiser plans at all. 




 Getting my second DUI. 




 This shows how weak the DUI laws are in that state.  She should get at least five years in prison. 




 Maybe, they regrwted that they did vote for Hilliary in the 2008 primaries. 




 The Harbor bus on the weekends can be bad. I remember going to Target one day and there was no bus for 40 minutes on the Northbound route. So I eventually took the Southbound route to the Walmart

The 56 was nailed me a couple of times but mainly due to construction delays that has nailed me with two job interviews. 




 He is an idiot.  Complete bungler. 




 US progressives need to understand the limits of what state intervention in the economy is.  Currently, there is too little regulation and state intervention in the US, but this country shows what too much overreach does. 




 This is just like Sochi. It is massive waste of public finances on facility that will have little long-term return on capital. 




 As much that I despied Morsei regime, this is totally bad tactics by the Egyptian government.  A better alternative by the military-backed government was to let Morsi go into exile into another country (aka: UAE or Saudi Arabia) 




 Cooper Fellowship has some rooms, but you need to be in  recovery and they have mandatory meeting requirements.  In addition, you have to share a room with somebody else. 




 He never get the death penalty. California is going to real hard time to getting a death penalty procedure past the Ninth Circuit and with the drug shortage, it will be even harder to get the proper drugs even if they did all of the death penalty procedures correctly. 




 This shows the effect of the insanity of being drunk. 




 dumbass. 




 Why do we want to have guns on post office ground, but refuse to extend unemployment insurance? What gives you right to bring a stupid gun into a post office? You are not hunting anything or you are not imminent danger of getting shto. 




 Yeah, I had a similar story. I lost my glasses in my own room. Could not find them.  Roommate finds the room in an area that I would not even consider looking for in my bedroom. 




 Maybe, the economy actually headed towards another downturn. 




 Those guy are psycho! Whole life term for those fools. 




 It seems that austerity never leads to any solution. 




 Hike gasoline to $8.00 a gallon in the US and you start to see some major changes.  The only to cut emission to stick it to people in their pocketbooks. 




 I lost several accounting jobs because I have had a serious case of ADHD. I just beginning to realize that my main problem is not ADHD, but the selection of music that I listen to.  I have to listen minimal or ambient music to have insane concentration.  I have the correct medication regiment, but I cannot function in perfectly silent background.  I guess ambient music has the correct connection to my brain.  




 I totally agree. 




 Is that a first world problem? 




 Why should they waste time with that? 




 What about in California? 




 Damn Brits! 




 Move it to a Schedule II drug. 




 He has the same approval ratings of Congress. 




 When will the India do something culture of male aggressiveness that promote thus behavior in the first place. 




 Consequences of a tax code gone insane. 




 It is because she was hot mama that it cost so much money If it was a dude, he would be a death row in a heart beat. 




 Why would I?  With the GOP, nothing is going get done. Obama is done and finished now. 




 Beautiful shot. 




 Where did you get that piece of proganda? The American Family Association or The Family Research Council. 




 He is a crook. 




 What a bunch of savages! They should be locked for a term not exceeding 50 years. 




 When I was 12. 




 Taking my pills. 




 bored at home. 




 This guy is a nut. 




 Well, that is the cost when you get duped by Goldman Sachs and you cannot collect your taxes properly. 




 Maybe they need join the fellowship Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob. 




 What is their fear?   




 This guy needs to wait ten years without commit another sex offense or felony (except for minor drug possession and pass a psychological evaluation before he can clear to practice the bar. 




 Having two DUIs. 




 They should have kept the major routes in central and North OC running until 2:30 AM such as the 53, 60, 43, 57, 50, 42, 29, 91, 1, 89, 47, 64, 54. 




 Yeah, that is why I did not go to my friends party last night. 




 The only way to end the problem is the enacting the Sherman Anti-Trust Act and tax, tax, and more tax until the corporate are banks are broken into dozens and dozens of regional and local banks that invest directly into the local and regional economies.  Our regulators are afraid of enacting a massive Sherman Anti-Trust act against the banks to break them up into dozens and dozens of large regional and local banks that are force to compete against each other instead of engaging in massive collusion.  This is the real free-market capitalism and not crony monopoly capitalism. 




 A UFO? 




 Because it upsets the balance sheets of his crony capitalist supporters.  Climate change is real and the right denies like a drug addiction because it undermines their entire political philosophy. 




 He never made reached his "potential" on the Lakers. How is another teaming going to use this guys abilities. 




 He is a punk. 




 Construction jobs. 




 I have been to Burning Man five times. 




 At my college.
