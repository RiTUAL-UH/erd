 I dunno, that stud on the left has that Chris Farley thing going on. Pretty sure he's also a famous athlete. 




 I've seen them at my local Sports Authority. They seem nice enough with decent quality. It's hard to tell until you try them on and see how they fit and how well they grip.

I think people recommend the Addidas and Nike because it's what they know not necessarily because it's the best shoe.
 




 Depending upon what they are used for it might make more sense to put them on the inside.

Back when I was a kid loading UPS trucks in college we used to two those with our fingers just to mess with them. It made it look like the package was mishandled when it wasn't. 

When you make it obvious that you don't trust the people doing your work they will probably mess with you. 




 I am if you want me to be. :-) 




 You can still buy those on ebay. I think the memory of them is better than the reality. But everyone at school used to have one of those. 




 lol....That's exactly what being a dad is about.  




 Wow! You look fantastic! 




 Saw this a while ago and was really impressed. Thanks for sharing this. 




 Didn't Chris Hanson already do this? 




 I'm honestly not sure how you could say it was boring. It was predictable for certain. But it was certainly action packed.  




 Typically I'll do some back work like face pulls or rows. I also like doing some ab sets.

But as long as you're not taking up 10 minutes between sets who cares what you're doing? 




 Pacific Beach. It's in front of the Mossy Nissan dealership, I saw it last night on my way to the gym. I had to look twice. 




 It's not creepy if you just give advice then back off. You could say something like "I've done the same thing, what worked for me was to lower the hooks".

For the record, I back into the bar too depending upon the rack I'm using because I hate looking into the mirror. 
























 I'll have to look for Ripper Street. 




 I highly doubt it would be able to get a lucky shot. Modern tanks move and engage way too quickly. Even if a WW2 tank was lucky enough to surprise a modern battle tank it would not be able to fire quickly enough to engage. And no WW2 tank could take even a glancing blow from a modern 120mm. 




 I've been watching the BBC show "Copper". It's a good crime drama set in NYC during the Civil War.

I watched the WWII drama "Generation War" and really liked it as well. It's a three part series with each episode running approx 90 minutes.

Both are avail on Netflix streaming.
 




 Congrats, great work!

What are your goals for 2015? 




 If that's the worst thing they find then you're doing well....lol.

Just never tell them the real story. Nobody wants to hear about how their parents tie each other up! :-) 




 I see what you did there..... 




 Some of those were really good. Nice find. 




 lol...no, not the Onion. Just a really poor law. 




 Nice ending. 














 It's OK to hate a lift. If you don't compete then don't do it. If you do compete then just accept that you're going to hate it. 




 According to the graphic it's from  Matthew White, "The Great Big Book of Horrible Things"

 That's a great frame of reference. It would be cool to see both superimposed somehow. 
























 Last post and I'm done discussing this with you. By the very definition it's not clickbait. 




 How is it clickbait? Clickbait is something that makes you click with the sole purpose of driving up ad revenue. 

THe article is from the Smithsonian Magazine which is hardly a clickbait site. 




 The story on plastic cells was particularly cool to me. At what point do we simply start replacing all of our aging cells with artificial ones? 




 The story on the plastic cells was really cool. Makes me wonder at what point are we simply going to replace all of our parts as they wear out. 









 The source for the boundaries seems to be this:

 Stunning example. Yours?

 If you want to see how U.S. counties have changed over time then this is your vid. You'll need to show it full screen to really see the changes.

Most telling to me is just how fluid the west has been . I assume part of that has to do with population growth but I wonder what other factors there are. 




 Search for trends in the dialogue of thousands of movie and TV shows, based on subtitles from Open Subtitles
Bookworm is like a lot of other word frequency sites. But unlike most, it directly incorporates links to every text searched, so you can actually see what drives changes; and it lets you customize the corpus so you can exclude texts that aren't interesting to you. 
This particular instance looks at movies and TV shows. Genre, location and language information from the Internet Movie Database textfiles. Click to see the movies/TV shows where the matches are found.
For some caveats, explanations, and examples, see the accompanying blog post. 

It's interesting seeing the trend over time of words. For example I put in "horse" and "car" to see how the trend looked over time. Unsurprisingly the use of the word "car" has gone up and "horse" has gone down. 














 I still don't think that it could penetrate the side. Armor thickness only describes part of the characteristics of modern armor. Modern armor isn't just steel like tanks of old. 

If it hit the rear then I could imagine it could disable it.

But, as mentioned below, there's little chance of a WW2 tank getting the draw on a modern tank with it's sophisticated targeting systems.  




 I don't think that's true. The depleted uranium armor on the M1 has a a projected thickness of an estimated thickness of about 610mm. The 8.8cm KwK main gun of the Tiger I could only penetrate 138mm of armor at 100 meters. It could only penetrate 171mm at 100 meters.

Edit, the Tiger II main gun could only penetrate a max of 202mm.
