 First Celebrity Crush: Winnie Cooper (Danica McKellar) from "The Wonder Years"

Close second: Kelly Kapowski (Tiffani Amber Thiessen) from "Saved by the Bell" 




 I have been drinking PBR since these kids were in diapers. I just love PBR. Now I get awkward stares from people because of the fucking hipsters. Thanks, hipsters! 




 This is why they keep prisons so cold. 




 "You touched a bar of soap!!!!! What were you thinking!? Give me those hands.." *applies entire bottle of hand sanitizer* 




 Isnt Obama trying to sell TVA to the same company?  




 Armed forces, DHS, TSA, NSA, CIA, FBI, ATF, Federal Police, DEA, USMS, BOP, ICE, ERO, HSI, USSS, CBP, etc, etc.. How many Federal agencies does ones government need to "police" its own people?

*This doesnt include the Militarized local/state police forces. 




 And guess who is paying that settlement, citizens...

Edit: My only point was. I totally agree this man deserved his settlement and much more. I am just wondering when we will start holding our Government accountable instead of paying settlements every time. I just want people/agencies/politicians held accountable. 




 Obama should relinquish his peace price to Edward Snowden. 




 There were around 40,000 people remaining at the show when he took stage. I think Woodstock peaked around 400,000 people. 









 Followers of the [Flying Spaghetti Monster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Spaghetti_Monster)? 




 Why doesn't he join the Caucasian Caucus? 




 Looks like Murica is about to spread some freedom. 




 McCain is an interesting lil fellar. Hell, Johns alright...... 




 You may take our lives, but you'll never take our POOOORRRNN! 




 I blame every President and Congress for the last 40 years. 




 Hank Paulson is a Republican. 




 That woman had grit. RIP 









 Its only a hate crime if white people do the beating.  




 Everything     is      fine. The    Government   knows    best  




 Fuck MSNBC! 









 Why cant we just stay out of other peoples business for a change. Do people have to call the cops about everything? geez. 









 Is Kanye West really the father? 




 When its warm, I can't ever tell if its actually going in my eye. I squeeze the bottle and then think, "Did anything actually come out of the bottle?". Then the tears run down my face and I finally know. 




 You, I like [you](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lzzi6cUfk91qj2vh0.gif).. 









 His words are refreshing and I hope they encourage the movement of mountains. 




 The Government does not work for the best interest of the people. It no longer governs by the restraints put forth by our founders.  




 I do it every day. It destroys relationships. 




 Since Reddit I have forgotten how to internet. 




 I cant stop staring at that ass on the right... 




 She is also trying to dismantle the 2nd Amendment. The woman is against the Constitution. I just wish her constituents realized or cared. 




 So he will overlook the use by the rebels just to save face? Are you ok with this? To me the man doesnt have much credibility left. And if he condones the use of Sarin by the Rebels, but not the regime, then he will lose even more credibility. His red line should be for anyone using Sarin. This isn't a game. I think we just need to stay out of it. Its not our fight. Are we going to have to go to war with these rebels in 15 years after arming them to the teeth? 




 What about the UN having reports it was the Rebels that used the sarin..? [Link](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/05/us-syria-crisis-un-idUSBRE94409Z20130505) 




 Yup.. and the fact that we are complacent and lazy just means we will continue to get it "up the ass". Nothing will change because we do not demand it. We get mad about it and then go on to the next Kardashian baby. 









 I grew up in a Southern Baptist home. When I say voice I dont mean the peons. I mean the larger voices of the Church. Please do not try and tangle my words. Christianity needs leaders that speak of Christ in his true identity, not the falsehood idealism that has plagued it. 




 I just agreed with Sarah Palin for the first time in my life. I will remember this day forever. 









 Finally a voice of the Christian religion speaks of acting Christ-like. Its refreshing to hear. 




 Now go tell him again. 




 "We need to dismantle the constitution to protect the constitution." - US Government 




 #How can Snowden be a traitor when the programs he exposed are unconstitutional?


##*My country, 'tis of thee,*  
##*Sweet land of liberty,*  
##*Of thee I sing;*  
##*Land where my fathers died,*  
##*Land of the pilgrims' pride,*  
##*From ev'ry mountainside*  
##*Let freedom ring!*   




 [Interview with Al Gore](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/14/al-gore-nsa-surveillance-unamerican?guni=Network%20front:network-front%20full-width-1%20Breaking%20news%20ticker:Breaking%20news%20ticker%20%28editable%29:Position1)

I wanted to post this here to bring attention to a possible ally in the fight to restore the 4th. What would we need to do to get Al Gore, a former Vice President, to become an outspoken proponent of our cause. I dont know if I posted this in the correct place or whether you see relevance in this post. I just wanted to bring it to the attention of the sub.  




 And to watch the President suggest that FISA Courts = Transparency just makes me sick to my stomach. 




 I dont know why I always find myself watching the entire video when this happens. 









 Swindler-in-Chief. 




 The terrorists are winning

FTFY 




 CNN even rehashed the Newtown school shooting yesterday as their top story. 

"pull the NSA story, quick... queue Newtown in 5....4....3...2...1.. and were back.." 




 this is shameful.. 




 yea... soo.... I have 1.5mb download speeds. Beat that! 




 If we cant agree on the bill of rights, what hope do we have to keep our Republic intact as it was intended? 




 The Constitution? 




 Selfishness 









 lol so logical 




 He could change the default SMTP address or assign an alias. 




 Good thing I got that 8 car garage for all my minivans. 




 Forget to back up your Christmas photos? important documents? well worry no more. For the low cost of the 4th Amendment, your data will be automatically backed up with absolutely no setup.. Call your Congressman and inquire today. 




 Distract the masses... 




 the 2nd amendment is just as important as the 4th. 




 Love that guy..  




 "If someone wants to know why their own government has decided to go on a fishing expedition through every personal record or private document - through library books they've read and phone calls they've made - this legislation gives people no rights to appeal the need for such a search in a court of law. No judge will hear their plea, no jury will hear their case. This is just plain wrong." - Barack Obama 2005

"Under the Obama administration, there has been a 60 percent increase in warrantless electronic surveillance" - ACLU

He knew/knows damn well what is going on. He campaigned against it in 2008. 




 i'm thinking alternator.. what youns thinkin? 




 Boy, someone got their feelings hurt.  




 Q: What's the difference between Obama and God?

A: God doesn't think he is Obama 




 Just another reason I regret voting for this swindler.  




 But atlleast its my choice to sign up for their service or not.  




 I do know about it though...  




 I choose to sign up for a corporations services which in turn allows them to use that information. I did not choose to sign up for the NSA spy on American citizens program. 




 ###George Washington would be proud of you, Edward Snowden.

##*and the home of the braaaave.* 




 I will agree that Reddit got a lil wild with the Boston Bombings. But lets be fair, all subs have their share of idiots. Thanks for sharing your story. 




 gawddamn i am pissed off about this shit. 




 I had no idea I wanted to say this same thing until you said it. 




 I would love to.. 




 ##Thats good to hear, fellow patriot. Thank you for your service. 




 "What good fortune for governments that the people do not think." - Adolf Hitler 




 "Great liars are also great magicians." - Adolf Hitler 




 But will you fight for those same rights when our own government is trying to dismantle them? 




 This is what tyranny looks like. 




 "By the skilful and sustained use of propaganda, one can make a people see even heaven as hell or an extremely wretched life as paradise." - Adolf Hitler 




 Someone tagged you as "CIA Disinfo Agent".. seems relevant.. 




 ### Murica 




 I will revolt with my vote. and what the hell do you mean "you people"? I am a gawddamn American that is Independent of either party and tired of the bullshit. 




 I don't think I will ever understand the bubble you live in. But its your life and your bubble. Obama weakened himself. 




 A considerable amount of damn commies in here. 




 oh... well i guess we should all pack our bags and go home now. just give up everyone, its not worth it.  




 A considerable amount of damn commies in here. 




 I voted for Obama 2wice. But now that he is acting like a drunk dictator, I regret my decision. He was the first and the last Democrat I will ever vote for. As Bush was the last Republican I will ever vote for. 3rd party for me from here on out. and honestly, it feels good to let go of the party chains for good. I am sick of them both.  




 The editorial board at the New York Times endorsed Obama in both elections. Stop being a blind parasite. 



















 ### Thank you for your post, fellow patriot. Have an upvote. 




 This is what tyranny looks like. 




 I started taking 1 hour to myself everyday, after work, for "meditation" about 5 years ago and it has reduced my anxiety levels tremendously. Just collecting my thoughts, digesting the day, and have a moment to have my mind all to my self. Its glorious. 




 I do not have a question. I just wanted to say hello and that I love your movies. Gattaca is still one of my fav sci-fi movies. Keep up the great work.

Thanks,

Jimmy

 Listening to [Chocolate Starfish And The Hot Dog Flavored Water](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSIK3UQyTow) right now. So many good memories. Still my fav LB album. 




 [Its just one of those days  
When you don't wanna wake up  
Everything is fucked  
Everybody sux  
You don't really know why  
But you want justify  
Rippin' someone's head off  
No human contact  
And if you interact  
Your life is on contract  
Your best bet is to stay away motherfucker  
It's just one of those days!!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4O_V_lZU04) 




 I can confirm this.
