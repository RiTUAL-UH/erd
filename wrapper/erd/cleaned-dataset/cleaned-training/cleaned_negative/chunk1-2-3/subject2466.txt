 My boyfriend was always on reddit so I decided to get an account to see how pointless it was.  That didn't work out so well. 




 Mom -  "I'm disappointed in you." 




 A few weeks after my dad tried committing suicide, when I was about 9 years old, he looked at me and said "you're the reason I hate myself." 




 My mom and step dad were fighting and it was time for me and my older sister to go to sleep.  My mom tucked us in and when she left our room I heard my step dad yell from down the hall, "the next time you see your mom she will be in a body bag." 





























 Do you regret going to college and spending money since you're not using your degree? 




 I'm a high school student writing a paper about the effectiveness of college and I'm curious to see how many people actually use their degree. 









 "Shut up! There is no laughing in math class!" 




 WHY DON'T I EVER SEE FOXES?! 





























 Not. even. kidding.

 YES! Today I was looking through this guy's profile and he is obsessed with diapers.  By scrolling down his news feed he had multiple pictures that said "share this if you're an adult that loves wearing diapers"...and then I looked through his profile pictures...big mistake...he had a picture of him in a diaper...never again.

 Since you don't use your degree at your job, do you regret going to college?
