 My dad is getting rid of his Pioneer [SC-AK310 speaker system](http://welectronics.com/stereo/sc-ak310.jpg) for a newer upgrade. Could I connect a controller to these such as the DDJ-SX or DDJ-SR? What cable(s) would I need?  




 Definitely want to go darker, get to a darker brown like in [this](https://www.3wisemen.co.nz/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/6efaed196d6ddc33b03f911d25dbe699/b/t/bt1068_1.jpg) picture 




 Bought [this](http://i.imgur.com/cg6EaRz.jpg) leather belt today, got tricked by the lighting to make me think it was darker. What is a good way to darken it? Would oil rub off on the clothes I wear with it? 
























 Just got a pair of Clarks Desert Boots in the mail, but I am confused on the sizing. I wear an 11 in Vans and dress shoes, so I ordered a 10.5 in CDBs. However, the shoes still feel somewhat big. Should I send them back and size down to a 10? Do CDBs usually fit loosely? (The fit of the shoe isn't bad, it just isn't perfect). 




 I'm in love with [these](http://us.puma.com/en_US/pd/el-seevo-canvas-mens-sneakers/pna887706697532.html?selvar=true), and for $36, how can you not get them? 




 If someone wants to PM me a code that would be fantastic. 
























 I really just want a cheaper version of a brogue boot. Something inexpensive, but still durable.  




 I love [these boots](http://www.allenedmonds.com/aeonline/producti_SF0181_1_40000000001_-1_) but need a MUCH cheaper option. Like around $100-$150. I definitely want burgundy as my color, but I am definitely open to looking into other styles, materials even (doesn't have to be leather, could be suede, what are options outside of suede burgundy CDBs?) 




 my question really is just how much is your heel supposed to move
