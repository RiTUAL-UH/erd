 Agreed!  Don't smoke the dips, smoke (some cold some hot, depends on the ingredient) the ingredients.  I also recommend pairing smoked queso with a good vienna style lager 




 Very fun x-mas album, big fan now! 




 Who is this???? 




 I believe my immediate words, out loud, were, "Holy Shit" 




 Awesome, thanks for the reference, best one so far,  once the paycheck comes in it's ordered.  And yeah, I'm looking for some help in my area, I've posted on craigslist and other subs to find a work out buddy, all my frends are industry people and I"m kind of on a 8-6 schedule 




 thanks 




 I want to start lifting, but not very familiar with proper form and safety.  Does anyone have tips, guidelines, or any good (preferably free) resources online.  I have a very physical job in a brewery and figured I might as well bulk up to make work easier as well as other things 




 So I really want to bulk up and get big.  Would like someone I can rely on as a spotter who has some experience power lifting.  I'm starting out at level 1 so I need someone who's patient.  I want a motiator and not a douchey gym rat.  I work at a brewery and have 3 very clear goal.

1)  Make my life lifting and moving kegs a lot easier

2)  Throw a shot put A LOT further.

3)  Make my cheating ex girlfriend sorry she left me for a stoner who works the register at a fast food joint.

I have a 24 hour fitness membership and will be working out probably after or around 8pm.  I'm motivated and committed but not knowledgeable in lifting, safety, form, all that good stuff.  If you're looking for a work out buddy, hit me up. 




 price? 




 I recommend skinning it.  Best to use a very sharp knife, about 6-8 inches long, take your time, go slow, you should be ok 




 best place for the top line for your beard is where the top of your ear actually meets your head 




 Go For the Gibson! 




 trim it short with an electric trimmer.  Keep staight, clean lines with a good straight edge razor, some even have a single blad on the reverse side for precise lines, that will give you a good groomed 5 o'clock look 




 I've had good experiences with Wahl Hair trimmers.  I've bought cheap trimmers before and it seems like they pull hair more than clip it, in my experience, you get what you pay for. 




 6 days a weeks I just wash it in the shower with soap with the rest of my face.  Saturday mornings I have a ritual of shampooing and conditioning with American Crew, it leaves it very soft,  I have a more curly facial hair type. 




 Submitting a pic of your face or chin would help, I myself and 2 1/2 months in on a full beard no trimming, feels very liberating, highly recommend it 




 So unfortunately I've been using Garnier frucetice since I was a teen because that was always what was in the house.  I've found out recently  a combination of that, and my poor diet may have possibly lead to my hair loss and may be reversable to an extent?  Anyone have info on this, or even better, a good shampoo that will promote hair regrowth???? 




 can Vitamin B and Iron help grow back lost hair??? 




 Soooooo......... should I upvote this? 




 Not a clarinet 




 yeah, the entire joke is Dwight says "tweeter" ugh sigh 




 just curious, who's your favorite Batman villain? 









 Favorite one so far, face yould have been awesome, you have a pretty smile. 









 The other gentlemen had fine beards indeed.  But you sir, got robbed. 









 Well maybe, that's just like, your opinion...  man 




 very pretty smile 




 agreed.  it's also a major plus smelling the peppermint and menthol extracts early in the morning.  Better than a cup of coffee. 




 Thanks for the tip on "training" the hairs.  I started wax just so I could get away without trimming the lower ones.  I eventually want to compete on the local market for beards and stache.  If you come up with a recipe you like please send it my way. 




 please excuse my typo's, feelin lazy 




 I'll have to give it a try.  I have some of their pommade and have had it for years, never had a reason to use it.  I use the american crew shampoo and conditionern on my beard once a week or before dates and my beard comes out sooooo soft 




 I'll check them out, thanks 




 Thanks, I was wondering about the American Crew pommade I've had some sitting around forever and don't have a reason to use it.  i do use their shampoo and conditioner for my beard and it comes out very, very soft. 




 I'm growing a pretty lengthy beard, with hopes in the future to compete.  My mustache is to the point to where I have to do something with it styling wise.  Are there any recommendations or waxing or styling products.  Went to CVS and picked up some Clubman's, didn't know if there were any othe rproducts worth looking at.

Also any good recommendations on good soaps or champoo's for the stache or beard? 




 Barcadia on Henderson has giant jenga (jenga with giant pieces so the tower's 4 feet tall)  good place to drink and meet people 




 Best new place: Jack Mac's Swill   Grill
Best nice but fine dinning place: Victor Tangos 




 appreciate the help, I'll check it out when it's not so hot 




 thanks, I'll check soon, when it's not 103 outside 




 I have a 6 cylinder 2006 mustang.  The alternator went out (already fixed) but we tried jumping the battery before we knew it was the alternator.  When jumping my car, my girlfriends neighbor, being the jackass he is, put the jumper cables on his battery backwards.  We were lucky in that the only thing that died was the stereo.  Anyone know what it might be, I receive no power.  If it s a fuse, which one is it? 




 really?  What kind of asshole is that kind of jerk to someone who's bummed out after they just put their dog down 




 dude, i'm just bummed out, don't be a dick 




 Dallas is not a hippie friendly city by any means 




 I Love Bunk, wait... that sounds bad. 




 You are freakin adorable 




 Don't know anyone, but I bet there's a lot of good tutorials for free (the best price) on youtube 




 and Dino's is pretty solid, best sandwich in the metroplex in my opinion 




 yeah, I'm not on that side of the Metorplex any more, but I love chilling out there when I can 




 it's just a really cool unique bar, hadn't been in a while.  I used to work there when I turned 21.  Last time I hung out there it was pretty much a hipster joint.  Good drinks, pretty good beer list, and a great jukebox.  The patio outside is great too. 




 If you're a hipster (or not but like to people watch and point and laugh at hipsters, i won't judge either way) check out the caves lounge.  Awesome lunch spot is Dino's subs, you can also go ice skating at the parks mall 




 Giant Jenga at Barcadia (knox henderson area) or at Goodfella's Pizza (Plano boardering frisco on Preston) is always fun. 




 The French Room, The Marquee Grill (used to be on the pastry team, it's awesome) Fearing's at The Ritz, Bolla at the Stoneleigh Hotel, Abacus 




 Here's a good place to order online: http://www.viennabeef.com/  I know how it feels.  I used to live in the East Village.  Have the Hot Doug's tattoo on my shin and everything.  I have not found a place yet though, but Angry Dog in Deep Ellum is supposed to be really good too. 




 So I finally dipped my toe in the soda pool.  I made a mediocre ginger ale but an awesome Basil Mint Soda.  I used active dry yeast and it worked very well.  It did make the soda's muddy with yeast biproduct though.  Anyone know how to make a clear soda or possibly the same thign with much lest yeast biproduct? 




 If you REALLY want to...  Cold smoke it, plenty of info out there as to how to cold smoke if you haven't yet, let it rest at room temp for half an hour, season it and sear it or do what you will 




 Anything off of Fishbone's "If you give  monkey a brain, he'll swear he's the center of the universe" album, Primarily 'Servitude' it's a pretty good song 




 You can do macaroons, or, you also have the key ingredient for the best park of any meringue pie. 




 It most certainly does 




 maybe not, but close, his last special that he produced on his website that he was selling downloads for sold $4.5 million, he produced himself.  I know much of that cash goes elsewhere, but without a production co. he's on the right path

Carlos Mencia:  Hosting late night infomercials selling gym equiment and workout programs.... 




 I know he pulls content off of reddit, youtube, break, ebaums and a ton other sites, that's the whole concept of the show.  It's a show that makes fun of what is on the internet.  Just sayin it's a repost of something that's aired on national television 




 Uhhhh... Tosh.0 two seasons ago? 




 just as effective, works as well, we just got it to evaporation point and lit it to burn it off quicker for efficiency sake.  Not as safe, but in a controlled environment with professionals, much quicker. 




 I tried several times in culinary school to make hollandaise, but I'd always crack under the pressure 




 Seared or grilled salmon in a tomato water broth and roasted asparagus.  If your interested send me a message. 




 Did you cook the whole thing, top to bottom?  If you did you should tail me the recipe. 




 Drugs are a bad, bad thing. 




 Combine it with enough tomato puree to make a chunky sauce, season accordingly and put over penne pasta.  It's a great "poor man's" meal. 




 Yeah, it's all flare for the table side.  The only time I've seen an actualy function for it, is if you're making a sauce with a and you want the primary flavor to be a liquor (say a tequila based sauce) and you don't want the alcohol to dominate the tongue you burn it off. but ahead of time in the kitchen 




 I only have a pump action shotgun.  It's an ok range for that, great if your shooting skeet.  Everyone I met there was nice for the most part, I wouldn't shoot range ammunition though, they carry the cheap stuff. 




 Check the big hotels, corporate hotels usually offer benefits to restaurant workers IF the restaurant is owned y the hotel, not just space leased out to the hotel.  I used to cook for Omni, it was a pretty good operation

 broken down step b step, like I'm 9, awesome! just what I was looking for 




 My friend and I have been homebrewing for a little while now.  We've been bottling and have found it to be a hassle.  We want to switch over to kegging but have no idea where to start.  Resources anyone???

Mucho Appreciado 




 wise girl sounds like a hooker 




 I highly recommend Kayden DiGiovanni at the Skin Art Gallery in Addison.  Check him out at DallasTattoo.net  I have quite  bit of work done, the only 2 I wasn't satisfied with are the ones he did NOT do, and he still even helped me out with them (I've been going to him for 9 years)  Also chek him out at facebook.com/dallastattoo 




 But in London, they don't have Smokey the Bear, they have SMACKEY THE FROG! 




 wow, really awesome, despite what ever kitchen you were in.  Are you in business or just do this for friends and family on the side? 




 It was an awesome show! 




 Very nice, never been out to that part of the country, can anyone visit the sound and go clam digging 




 Do any redditors out there have knowledge as how to practically calculate something on the scoville heat scale?  I'm working on a hot sauce and would like to know the actual SKU for bottling and marketing purposes.  Any information would help 




 ot me beat.  3lbs most I've done.  I was cooing in a restaurant going out of business and the last day we were open my Chef "cleaned out the walk in"  it was a race between myself and the food runner on a 3lb plate.  The volume was rough, but forcing it down fast was far worse. 




 I don't know who you are.  I don't know who your friends are.  But that, that is amazing 




 nice, my buddies and I have worked with ghost peppers before.  We had a dick coworker who caused problems (we were all chefs in training) so we steeped ghost peppers in water and used that to make a dense gelatin and put his knives in it them set it in the cooler over night.  Highly recommend trying it some time.

But thanks, I'll have to check it out, I work right around the corner from there.  How many wings does one have to polish off? 




 nice, that's the kind of stuff I'm looking for, what else do you guys have? 




 thanks for the suggestion, but looking for local places, I could do BWW challenge anywhere, but thanks 




 Any one out there in Dallas know of any good restaurants that have some sort of eating challenge.  I'm aware of the wing challenge at Pluckers.  Used to work there so I'm very aware.  Any others?  Would anyone be game to join up and start a group for it? 




 The Pearl Cup in the M Streets area is the best coffee I've had in Dallas 




 Sweet, never thought I'd see this place on the net, especially reddit.  I live half a block from there. 




 Yeah we do 




 Private message me, I'm interested and local 




 Bonnie Ruth's up in Allen has an awesome brunch buffet with every classic you can think of.  Dessert is was included too which we thought was really cool. 




 that's amazing, how much time did it take you to piece it all together

 funny, they don't look asian 




 I think it's sooooooo cool you're a Batman fan, not a lot of chicks are superhero fans let alone Batman fans 




 Chubby is awesome, keep posting 




 Good God, why can't I find any Ranger's fans like you in my neighborhood.  I"m on the wrong side of the metroplex 




 I bet t was a "B" channel on the cable box 




 "allow it" to happen for a while, put up remote surveillance camera's in your house that you can view from the web or your smart phone.  Use this to file for divorce, leaving her penniless.  Once he paper work is ready, hang onto it.  Wait for her to have her ex over one day.  While their sleeping in your bed together, sneak into your own house with another woman.  MAKE SURE SHE IS HOTTER THAN YOU PHILANDERING WIFE.  She could be an ex, some girl at the bar, a co-worker, a hooker, it doesn't matter.  Drop the paper work on the coffee table while being un-heard, then start going at it as rough and as loud as possible.

Really make it loud.  When your wife comes out with her ex, don't stop, just smile.  With one hand give a thumbs up, the other hold up divorce papers.

She'll get the point.  After a while there's not much that'll fill the void from being hurt by your ex, but bourbon will help.
 




 I have no words sir.  Touche 




 Any which way you cut it, you're still sucking a dick. 




 Go for a small dice and when you sautee your mire poix go for a darker carmelization (careful not to burn)  You should get a sweeter taste.  I like to use this in my marinare and pizza sauce.  2 carrots, 2 stalks of celery and 1 onion, 2 garlic cloves 1/2 cup olive oil, 2 16 oz cans of tomato puree and 1 small can of dice tomatoes.  Simmer the mire poix and garlic, add tomatoes and cook out for 2 hours, season.  For marinara leave be, for pizza sauce blend.  Pretty tasty, and if you blend she'll never know it's there.

 At what point in your life have you been the most lost and conflicted about making a personal decision.  How did you handle it and what were the outcomes.  If you had to go back, would you have done the same thing? 




 You are seriously, CRAZY adorable 




 Yeah, I've been into Neil Young for a while.  29 years old and have been into his stuff since early high school, very cool pic, thanks for sharing it

 Ha, I'm way too curious for that to be a deterrent  




 From Opie (SoA) to Dopey, sorry man, never shave again 




 Yeah my whole plan is to treat it as a donor bike and throw as much as I can on a new rigid frame.  I did have a Honda shadow 750 ace.  Very reliable bike.  Only complaint is it was limited on customization and many parts on the baby that should have been metal were plastic or fiber glass.  Road like a champ though. 




 Thanks for the feedback, good knowledge for a HD TIL (no sarcasm intended)  I did find one auction site that sells everything from repo's to totalled out bikes.  Minimum bids start at about $200.  Don't have it saved on my phone but cam send a.link later if you're interested

 I believe you're not allowed to do that awesome spin move to go from reverse to forward that Jason Statham does in every driving movie.  It is acceptable to do so in the afternoon though 




 Very lovely, happy 21st 




 Thanks for the lead, but it looks like they only deal in metric.  I have friends into cb750 rebuilds, will forward them here. 




 "Pearl of the Stars" by Coheed and Cambria.  Not because of the content itself, but because of the emotional connection to that song and an ex.

 If you wanted to use beer or wort product to get a starter going I recommend using whole, fresh, unacidulated and unused grain of your choice.  2 row is cheap, and spin it in a food processor untill it a fine flour, sift and start your starter

 "Last Call" is a great read.  Its everything you'd ever need or want to know about Prohibition in the United States.  It also has a lot of great knowledge of the long term and current effects from the fall out of.

 Never canned it before, I either serve it immediately or cryo-vacced it and gave/sold it to friends 




 2 celery stalk, 2 carrots and 1 LG red onion small dice lightly sauteed in 1/2C olive oil, when translucent add 2lg cans tomatoes puree and 1 small diced tomatoes.  Season with salt, black pepper and herbage to taste, simmer on low for as many hours as possible, puree and stain if you'd like

 Wings with Dad while watching the homerun derby, not a bad way to celebrate! 









 Yeah, no welding experience, i didn't even think of that, i was more concerned with setting the petcoc and running a gas line 




 Never done a chop, used to work for HD at a dealership, in parts.  I have a pretty good starting knowledge but some things like gas tank set up and jetting carbs make me a little nervous.

 My camera got dropped about 6 feet.  Everything works fine except the shutter button.  Any idea of how to repair it or anyone who will.  Sony wants $250 just to look at it.

 We made sure not to serve before the ceremony,  afterward, well, different story 














 My old compouter died in the worst of ways. I just got a new desktop, Windowsn 8 and downloaded the most recent version of Zune Market place.  I have a 32G Zune HD,  How do I get everything from my Zune to my desktop.  Apparently syncing it is enough. 




 God Bless Texas, where was it? 




 You ma'am, have the perfect pair! 




 Best place I've found so far is Jerry's Woodfire Dogs in downtown Lakewood.  I actually have the Hot Doug's logo on my shin and spent plenty of time there, nothing here I've found has been that close 




 We have some scratches in the (what we hope) surface area of our skin wrap on our company's delivery truck.  Anyone have solid experience on how to buff out the scratches if it's possible?  Any solid links to information would be helpful too, google didn't do much for me on this search. 




 Very Interested, I live near GWB and Custer, I work at The Lakewood Brewery at Jupiter and 635, very close by, I'm interested in what you guys may have to offer.  I know I won't be the first one, but I don't have an athletic bone in my body, would like to turn that around

 Have any Dallas redditors shopped around different Crossfit gyms?  I was lookking for recommendations on price and quality.

 It's an awesome brewery too thanks.  See above comment for second half though

 I really hope these aren't the same guys I'm thinking of.  Last Beer Week 3 guys claiming they were starting a cidery came into the bar I was working at (Jack Mac's) for the cask taping.  We caught them trying to steal beer off of the firkin.  Then they got so wasted 2 passed out at their table, then we caught them trying to walk their tab.  Hope its not the same guys, karma is a bad hangover 




 I actually have been loosing weight, see comments below.  I have a very physical job at a brewery, hauling kegs.  I've cut back on my drinking and have been making smarter food choices.  Next paycheck I'll be able to afford a membership to a gym already picked one out.  I also throw shot put during the spring (If we get one in TX this year) and will be loosing A LOT of weight during the summer at work whether I try or not. 




 yeah, I think that'll be the first step, I'm gonna start with the longest guard and work my way down 




 Yeah...  he's actually a pretty slim guy, but I noticed that too when I first met him 




 yeah, i'm working on that, been steadily dropping actually, about 15lbs in 3 months was at about 270, I work at a brewery in TX so I know I'll be loosing a lot more this summer 




 I have to respectfully look at the photo again, my hair is going pretty quickly now, it started when I was 21 and has been going exponentially recently, despite healthier decisions, you might want to look again.  But thanks for the encouragement.

 Grapefruit and/or orange marmalade with candied ginger.  You can also make and store an orange cure mix if you cure your own salmon 









 Check out Lakewood Brewing instead.  It's the same price, you get to keep a Belgium style glass, and the lines are A LOT shorter.  They have the same music and food trucks, but it's a lot less pretentious and crowded.  Plus their beer is a lot better, if you're a beer knurd, also more consistent and true to form.  Big Fan!

 I just moved here from Dallas.  I want to be healthier and more active.  I love being out doors and would like to go hiking in the hills out in the desert. 

Any good suggestions on where beginners should go.  I've been to superstition once while visiting a while ago. Where else is good for solo beginners?

I live in Mesa, so anything out this direction would be appreciated.

 Queens, my bad 




 Makes sense for Juice, when he was being pressed in season 4 you find out he's originally from Brooklyn.  The others I haven't noticed.  Jax on the other hand, I've heard Aussie, Brit, and Nor Cal , I think he's getting tired. 




 Are we don't this price is right style? 




 And let the face swapping begin! 




 Marx forgave "Tig's debt" though when Jax turned over the fun business to him though.  Marx was no longer after The by the end of season 5.  Second to last episode of that season, but not sure.

 I agree with OP.  Its a possibility.  I've wrote off trying to predict what Sutter will do or assume he has rules of how a character will go out. 




 In not sure I get the punch line?  Help me out, maybe put a finger on it? 




 Checks and balances 




 I'm personally not taking too much stock in Sutter stating that 2 sons die.  It's possible, but seeing that Sutter likes to go the opposite direction in big episodes from what people think he'll do.....  I think saying that could have been a misdirection.   Plus, if it is true, Nero isn't a Son, neither is Gemma, the death toll could be far greater in the last 5 episode.  Plenty of time for folks to die. 




 Everything here mother was saying Jax took on as a direct reflection to himself.  The rent is punctuated by her saying something about a horrible father and a dead mother right before Jax puts a round through her head.  All foreshadowing Tara's death in a very sneaky way 




 Thunder header 2 into 1 tailpipe is common amongst the bikes in Sons.  You see a lot of the sidekick seats as well.  Its a single piece 2 up seat.  HD diamond black grips.  Those are the big ones.  Chib's earlier bike had the fork tube boots, but I think with the fairing, the boots would clutter your front end too much.  

If you go with the thunder header (has a great sound) or any other full pipe you'll need to do a stage one air intake upgrade as well

Edit: also black lower front fork sliders and HD black magnum wheels 




 Actually very caught up, to the episode.  You didn't soil anything f for me.  Only takes 2 minutes to be considerate for other redditors though 




 Thank You!  I'm glad I'm not the only one who thinks it's Nero.  When he left the room when the sons saw what happen it looked a little suspect.  Then, when the focus was in him at the end and he says, "how could they not leave after what happen".  Clear foreshadowing. 




 Seen the episode already but still.  A spoiler alert tag, I'm sure, would have been much appreciated by some folks here 




 Go back and watch when Venus' mother rants at the kiddie porn studio.  Kurt Sutter drops some serious foreshadowing.  Bravo 




 Minception 




 If have to go with the Piano Key Neck Tie 




 If your looking for which mods are on his bike I can let you know.  Used to work in custom accessories at a HD dealership in TX 




 No disrespect intended, but your mom is smoking hot.  If she were a dinosaur, she'd be a Babe-a-saurus Rex 




 Some chick and dude meet on a boat, at the end ( SPOILER ALERT) a big rock gets dropped in the water 




 Added 




 Serious case of MLA 




 Haven't watched this episode yet but I'm saving it.  I miss tales from the dark side 




 Blanch de Bruxelles, is Euro, but awesome 




 A kid called me an asshole, I told him I wasn't, he was convinced 




 Yes....  Yes you are 




 I don't follow, what's the twist? 




 Daaaaaaaamn 




 I think he's permastuck in that expression 




 "Chump Chance" by Big Business 




 My day just started and seeing this may be the coolest thing that happens all day, awesome 




 Pretty sure at least 2 of those are photo shopped 




 Years ago I bought a legit bike jacket at a Wilson's leather outlet store,  Sturdy, warm, not a logo on it and 1/3 the price 




 Shiiiiiiiiiit, I got serious chills down my arm from that one! 




 What year is that photo from?  Might be a good post for /r/oldschoolcool 




 Who were the graduates and what year did they graduate? 




 Nice, I was on my pop's Ultra, full size wind shield. 




 I can't imagine what it would look like without a wind screen 














 Looks like you're not eating any....  Dry toast 




 Its like ordering a sandwich on wheat, and your waiter brings it to you on rye 




 That you should of ate! 




 *bobber* 









 Well that escalated quickly 




 I got a serious chill at the end, did not see that coming 




 Take a motorcycle safety coarse 




 I do what I can. 









 I'm not tech savy, please be patient with me:
I downloaded VLC media player last week and every since I've had problems:

Netflix App wont work
I can't load videos on streaming sites like Coke and Popcorn or ProjectFree
I can't figure out how to get rid of the crap programs that come with VLC

How do I fix this?  I was also curious of people's opinions on the best spyware/malware and free virus protection as well.  Any help would be appreciated. 









 I agree totally with that.  Both probably made mistakes somewhere 




 Rahr is bigger.  I believe they produce more barrelage per year than DEBC does.  I'm not totally sure, I havent checked the BA Forum letter recently.  But that is why I said "bigger than most"

I really doubt S S did what they are being accused of.  I know for a fact there are tap handles in that restaurant that local breweries didn't have to pay for.  That doesn't mean they didn't say what they are being accused of saying, but it doesn't help DEBC's case either.

As for serving Franconia over Deep Ellum, yeah, I don't get that either.  I want there, I dont know what happen.  Not serving there beer could be just an excuse for a deeper issue like you said.  One thing to keep in mind though, liking a certain brewery/style of beer/or individual brew is ALL subject to opinion.  There are some beers that most people in the Dallas scene love that I think are inferior.  There are also beers that I love other people think are shit.  Its all opinion. 




 I don't think they are a massive corporation.  But based on their distribution network, number of accounts, and total barrels sold, they are MUCH larger than most of the breweries in the area.  And by contrast, much larger than a single restaurant that's only been open or about 4 months 




 He's trying to play up being the little guy, a small self distributed brewery.  It helps him look favorable as the victim.  He leads people to believe they're still a small operation, they don't have distribution, which they do, just not in this area.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with picking up a distributor in one area and not another.  But to tell people you don't have when to look like such a small operation when you actually do else where is misleading. 




 In the blog written about this John states that he's the little guy and the victim being bullied.  He stated that he is not distributed by Andrews or BEK which is only half true.  They are still self distributed in DFW, but distributed by BEK in the large southern cities in the state.  Is another good example if how he's misleading and petty 




 FOLLOW UP:  Replaced it with a new one last night from Autozone.  After taxes it was $250.  It took me about an hour and this was my first time making this repair on a vehicle.  The three places (one dealer and 2 national chains) I looked into to do the repair for me, each gave me estimates for $550-$600 for a one hour job.  Proof they're all out to gouge.  Moral of the story... I'm doing my own work. 




 No sources, no references, and a weak looking site...?  Yeah, I'd believe it....  Why was this even posted? 




 Going back through both Deep Ellum's post about this and Scotch and sausage's, and looking in the comments of the previous note our DEBC has had, is scary to see how much some of DEBC's fans have "drank the kool aide" 




 Sorry. I meant to type the word "remember" not tendency.   Was trying to type at a red light and not paying attention.  Was meant to read, "do you remember the brand name?" 




 * remember* not tendency sorry. Was trying to type at a red light 




 Awesome.  Do you tendency the brand on it? 




 Anyone have a good suggestion on a brand of alternator for an 06'?  My first one lasted 85k miles. In sitting in an NTB with a dead alternator that's 2 years old and Ford is showing me no love.

I'm looking for a suggestion in a quality product that will last more than 2 years.  Also, if there are any maintenance tips to make one last longer I'd appreciate it. 









 They have similar style on Jpcycles.com 









 I used to sell for Harley and ride myself.  The biggest things are enjoying the ride, being comfortable, and controlling the bike.  HD has accessories and mods you can put on the Dyna series to help with all of those.  You can get things like "the reach seat" which is comfortable and moves you closer to your controls as well as curved handlebar riders that will bring your bars closer to you.  Get the bike you want and can afford then customize it to for you.  Do what you want man, is a Harley! 




 In guessing the frame is a 0 out 62 up?  




 What you went through was incredibly unfortunate, but your Halloween must not go un wasted this year.  Take the new scar and run with it my friend.  Bond villains, classic horror monsters, the day will be your! 




 Yeah, your guests getting popped one in the face (in the not fun kind of way) usually isn't good for business 









 Yeah....  Its not doing well.  They get a lot of vagrants coming off the dart real running off customers 




 I'll never make someone for dealing with addiction. I see it a lot in my mine of work.  But I will make fun of someone for being a Dick 









 Yes, Park Lane and 75.  They put it up yesterday  









 Holy Hell. What's the size on that wheel? 














 Is there a link to that specific clip? 




 I was wondering if anyone has a link to the drop WTDS for Sport Sturm's birthday.  It was a barrage of overlapping drops of Bob and other ticket members doing Bob impressions.  I think it ran for a little over a minute. 




 Looks great!  I like how you shaped a little lip on it with out going full bobtail.  Nice touch. 




 All I can say is wow.   The symbolism is amazing. 




 Mesmerizing 




 Michael from Lakewood here.  The whole crew is pretty impressed and very proud of you guys. 




 I have a buddy who rides an ultra and I busy his chops all the time just for fun.  He's 33.  Truth be told I'm jealous because he's riding and I'm not, lol 




 Go for a straight forward traditional summer beer Czech/bohemian Pils are always a good choice.  Check for local ones NOT in green bottles 




 I'm so glad this is in my life 




 Wow. Topical humor and 16 years in the making.  There are people who are now turning 21 who can now go in there to drink who won't be old enough to get the reference. Still clever though, I must admit. 




 I'm a big fan of keeping it 200mm and under.  I actually prefer a 180mm.  I road the rocket custom when it first came out.  The stability in a straight run was phenomenal.  Turning was tough hard and sluggish.  It really depends what type of riding you want to do.  If you like a at straight haul go wide.  If you like a lot of twists and turns go narrow. 




 Who here has an awesome allergy specialist they would recommend.  I took to google a found a few, but I'd like recommendations if possible.  It's getting to the point where I'm loosing A LOT of sleep. 




 My vote's Frisco 









 I've tried it before, it fucking sucks 




 Cool,, have a membership, it's only 15 if you don't  




 3 stop lights 




 Just got a membership at Just fitness in Casa Linda.  Want a buddy, male or female, don't care, just want o have fun working out and someone I can push and who will push me.  I'm 29, male and training to loose some weight.  Cardio and weights and a little polymetrics/cross training would be ideal 




 Sad thing is, I got more pivoted due to a type-o than I have posting anything else.... 









 Central Market on Lover's lane is the best place to go.  Or any of the whole foods.  Lakewood brewing has a couple bombers out right now and word is in the next couple of days they'll be releasing a bourbon aged version of their imperial milk stout.
