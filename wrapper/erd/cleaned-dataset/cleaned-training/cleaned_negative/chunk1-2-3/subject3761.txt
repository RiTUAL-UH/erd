 But...Italy can't top...it's not right... 




 Downloaded it a couple hours ago and I love it!!  




 Are you only first discovering the awesome that is magic ocarina???? It's a smule app like magic piano but more mystical. 




 Dat tree 




 Accio. Most definitely. You can always use it to get yourself a tool to kill someone with anyways. 




 Hope you're okay with some Japanese songs;
Air Force Ones-nelly
Dancer in the Dark- Megurine Luka
After dark- Asian Kung fu generation
Alones- aqua timez
Awake and alive- skillet
Boom boom boom boom- vengaboys
Burn it down- linkin park
Byouteki kikkyu Nikki- uverworld
Caramelldansen-caramell
Cherry saki yuuki- an cafe 
Those are all I can get right now. Hope I helped!
 




 I invade people's personal space. Often.
 




 Autobots...they won't try to annihilate me. 




 I think all cable networks have a porn section. Only problem is you paid for this one.  




 All of the comments before me are so...technical (and probably correct). I was going to say photoshop and be done with it...now I have to learn... 




 Lost it at the monster mash.  









 Thanks! I've decided to just go ahead and jailbreak. There isn't that much to worry about I guess! 




 This isn't what I think of when I think of the Axis Powers...but it's more accurate than Hetalia...probably... 




 That was terrible XDD 




 Where was credit given to 9gag? The watermark? Then 9gag has written us a bibliography.  




 Reddit, have we really come to taking posts from 9gag? We're still bitching at them for doing the same thing to us.  














 The control of bamboo. Must be a lovely thing.  




 I can never get my arms to bend right so I always end up either in a strange position or using a pencil or something...

Well...I guess eyeballs could count. But it's probably not as satisfying as a ball scratch.  




 That they would. I'd find it surprising for any guy to agree with me.  




 Yep. 









 I actually read the whole thing...and about the pics. I think the preview is either legit or accurate. I wouldn't really want pics for the shit lasagna tub though. 




 The fact that my name is used in the same story as Comic Sans worries me.  




 It ran away from my computer. And it will never come back.  




 Kuroshitsuji. Just explain anime as sexy men that fight and it's also full of sexual innuendos.  




 On le front page! Congrats on both achievements! 




 Me and my friend actually had quite the debate about this. She kept saying green while I insisted black; the glass over the reflective part is green. The actual reflective part is black. What do you think reddit? 




 Harry Potter plot canyon:
Think back to Sorcerer's Stone. Remember how Hagrid got Harry from the house? 
Now think up to Deathly Hallows. Snape got Harry. 
I always found Harry Potter plot holes the most fun ^_^ ((I was actually hoping I would get to show off this 'discovery' on reddit. I'm not saying I'm the only one who noticed this though.)) 




 Go to the store and buy some of those cone facemasks (I've found a pack of four for $2). Put those on and tie something around your head. Go to every store in the vicinity. Occasionally just stand on the sidewalk. The looks from other people make this the most fun.  




 The kindergartners at an elementary school in my town (Well, two schools) all have iPads in the classrooms. When I was in kindergarten (not too long ago actually, about about nine years ago), we had blocks. Not legos. Blocks that would connect to each other up and down but you had to tape them together to make cars and such. Not iPads. Yet at my school we have two 6 year old Macs for all of us to share then a bunch of PCs. Kids need to start being kids again.  




 Want. Miko. Want.

 These are all of the Vocaloid songs on my iTunes. Some are covers, and I tried to remove any repeats. Sorry about the lack of links...it would take quite a while to link to all of these. I know there is a lot of Gakupo here...I love Gakupo and there wasn't enough of him! I'll gladly give you links to these if you would like though!

 And that ladies, is why tampons are the route to go.  




 I look back at memories from when I was a kid and since it was a while back, I can only remember a few things. Things I remember about my room are blue, my sisters room is red, and the kitchen is green. Outside is orange or white.  




 Cool! I never knew there was actually a name for it.  









 I must say, using reddit as advertisement was a wise choice.  




 Yes. All the time. I'm usually thinking about Hetalia or such though.  




 I got my mom a cake...well...I made it. 




 I would still recreationally sleep and eat.  




 ...Rammstein memes overload....XD 




 You...are...a...saint. 

Well, really I don't want to take notes to write a script tomorrow...and cleaning is too mainstream. 

But tis a valid point. I should indeed get off the internet.  




 Where was it??? GIVE ALL THE RAMMSTEIN RAGE ENCOUNTER UPVOTES!!!! 




 Yes...it was a guy that dresses like a woman. I *do* know the difference. 




 The leg sticking out is really bothering me... 




 There was a transvestite named Riley addicted to being an adult baby on my strange addiction...striking resemblance too... 




 Sometimes I do, but then I think of people's intelligence level and one of the most widely known products is a blanket with sleeves. Then I start to think that around 2010 we started going backwards... 




 Thanks! 




 "Wait...no...nevermind...we actually...and then...*insert contradiction here*...bro you just had to be there." my favorite.  




 The only students I tend to see on reddit are engineering students.  




 I think everyone needs to give this kid a cookie.  




 My teachers get all on my case along with the rest of the planet. When ever someone asks me "Why are you so quiet?" (I'm not really a quiet person...at all) I respond with "I really shouldn't plot murder out loud.  




 ...dafuq? _

That definitely belongs here...

Did my best! 




 Zelda on SNES....memories ^_^ 




 The blank spots in the packaging. They're irritating.  




 Can't...by the time I decide to get out of the shower, the water is freezing and I have to do gymnastics to rinse my hair... 




 Indeed. 




 You look a tad like Emma Watson. But these are awesome!! 




 Seen this comment on this video at least 5 times now XD 









 Well, those of us who can spell properly aren't exposed to search results that are spelled lyk d1s.  




 I would be in dire need of new trousers.  




 Just to correct....this is transformers animated. 


And my childhood is ruined. 




 I am not alone. When I was younger I always tried to put myself into a state of just consciousness.  




 Take a snuggie, phone/laptop, and snacks with for the poopy process. Much more relaxing.  




 Someone better take a cactus over there.... 









 Yes!!! Im always much better with a pen (or liquid pencil), good with a mechanical pencil, and pretty bad with just a pencil.  




 Le Jesus of bubbly beverages.  




 Well....smells is an easy one. You know that fresh 'snow just melted and no one has allergies yet' smell? Every time I smell that smell I think of elementary school and have a dire need to go on some monkey bars.  




 i find it silly i just gave it its 666th upvote ^_^ 




 Good to help the unknowing...with STDs.  




 one does not simply...create a rage comic. 


must study le art of rages. took me 3 months of viewing masterpieces to make my first rage.  




 psh...once youve seen blue waffles, youve seen it all 









 The Help. i figured it would be one of the worst movies ive ever seen considering my sister picked it ((shes the opposite of me...i prefer action/horror/blow up movies)) and the setting is quite a few years back. it was /actually/ pretty good.  














 XD Well...better not to lie! 




 actually, google is on the confirmed list of sites going down http://sopastrike.com/ 




 Indeed...especially when crash is involved *epic trollface* 


































 I only add people I know outside of reddit as mods. And if they have more than one account, they can use the account that is already moderating.  




 Boxers or briefs? 




 How exactly do you make a beacon?
 




 The seed is 'gnocci' and the mountains get good at x -285 y 106 z 407. 














 The first thing I noticed in the album was the Deathly Hallows graffiti.  









 Mules are sterile. 




 I decided I would update the software on my iPhone. No problem, right? Wrong. I look and it shows the 'connect to iTunes' logo. That's not right. Next, I saw a notification that my iPhone was in recovery mode and needed to be restored. I figured there was no other way to fix this since it was stuck on that screen, so I restored of course. I'm just hoping I'm not alone on this.  




 This made me cry! I'm getting the last issue...I don't care what it takes!! 




 I accidentally built a house at cloud-level...but only the 2nd floor is at cloud level. It's pretty irritating to go upstairs and then there is a giant cloud taking it's time going through my house.  




 FAKE. Nobody has that signal with At T. 




 Piranha.  




 87...A ton of these names decided to run away from my mind. Time for a marathon... 




 I would put my best skill at procrastinating, but if that's not accepted, then I guess I'll just make them all feel a bit too awkward.  




 This is fantastic! I'm glad nothing like this happens to me; I'm also glad you're alright (physically, anyways)! Message me when next part comes around!
 









 I've used this a couple times. You can change the angle and difficulty (how fast it 'scrolls'). It's pretty fun and the faster it moves, the better the workout.  




 I'm wondering if I should even bother updating or not...It seems there are more complaints about 6 than praise.  




 I know that (I actually prefer that subreddit), but my friend really wanted one Luka-centric. So I gave her her subreddit...and tried to explain it wouldn't grow that large.  




 Absolutely.  




 I didn't put it there, actually. My building skills are quite horrendous. And I was on creative and like to use glowstone instead of torches around my house.  









 At least he didn't click an NSFW links...from what we can see. 
 




 The fridge seems like a good deal until you realize that $100.00 buys about 3-4 bags of decent groceries.  



















 If they do take out all of the well known characters for 4, the movie will do as fantastic as the final seasons of G1. Once the characters people know and love are gone, they stop watching.  









 Back in 6th grade I had the pleasure of watching one of my classmates do an oral report after having vodka for lunch. It was hilarious. He never got in trouble. Just suspended for doing other stupid shit.  




 GET SOME HOT SAUCE ON THAT SHIT. 









 I was playing Minecraft and noticed the sun looked a bit odd. It was a solar eclipse! Has anyone else witnessed this? If so, how often does it happen? 




 I honestly found the Bount arc terrible. And I thought it was canon back then-so it was supposed to be awesome! 




 That's a dub I haven't heard in a long, long time. 
 




 The only person I am super picky about, is Kisuke MUST be played by Owen Wilson. 




 You have a problem with pictures of a dead fetus posted online yet you're on r/WTF?  




 Fake. 




 Honestly, you should try to stay around people as much as possible. With this, the last thing you should do is isolate yourself. That's when the bad stuff always happens; when people get the logic of "I'll stay alone to save others." If he is truly this crazy, you being out of the way wouldn't necessarily stop him.  



















 This belongs on facepalm (facebook post) and it shouldn't be here (it's a screenshot, check the rules). Also, I really don't get it... 




 Hetalia has mentions of WW2 and focuses on the Axis and Allies.  




 Well...I am quite the Hetalia fan. So, whilst I was in social studies, we were already getting rather off topic and in my corner of the room, we were talking about WW2. I decided to blurt out "I love the axis! Germany is lovely!" My teacher didn't appreciate that and I had to go through and explain Hetalia to a room of non-anime viewers. 




 What's the age range? 














 Austria. 




 I think this is pretty awesome for LP and Transformers fans like me...but I'll never get one.  




 It's a my little pony extension for google chrome (ponyhoof).  














 Bidding ended at about $250.00. Little less..But that tab makes scary sounds.  














 J-just take all of my upvotes!!! 




 how...did...you...FIND THIS??? I could hug attack right now!!! 



















 More like Italian.  




 My friend wants to be buried in a tomb of anime plushies...mostly Sasuke.  




 We all remember in the first movie when Hagrid went and got Harry from his house after the attack, right? Well, what about when in the last movie it was Snape to get Harry out of the house? This is definitely the biggest plothole I have seen in the series. Feel free to correct me, Potter fans, if I'm incorrect on something.  




 Break Stuff -Limp Bizkit. My I'm pissed off song.  




 Skillet is a Christian band.  




 Don't mean to brag or anything...but...crotch scratches are nice.  




 One does not simply...get sick of pasta.  




 I really didn't realize how many pics I went through until I was done! That was quite the adventure though! I didn't think it would look so nice towards the end after seeing everything torn apart. Well done! 




 Will you be a redditor when you're older? 









 My sister works in a salon and gets hair splinters in her feet all the time. 




 Considering how anti-9gag reddit is, at least crop out the logo to avoid ridicule.  









 We were talking about alliances and stuff...I got sent in the hall after laughing about Germany invading France...three times.  




 Boxers or briefs? 




 My brother in law has worked countless hours in factories for the past six years to support my sister, my niece, and now my newborn nephew, and my sister doesn't even give him a birthday card or say thank you. He's sacrificed everything down to his laptop (she kept hers though) to keep them out of the streets and she is asking for a new otter box. She also hasn't had a full time job in the whole time they've been together...spent the past six years on an assistant teacher degree that she dropped out on a month before she would have finally graduated.  




 World is mine hatsune miku 














 GerIta, USUK, Spamano 




 Psh...once you've seen blue waffles, you've seen it all. 









 It was probably the only time Italy ever followed orders from Germany!  




 A walkthrough had to be a mood killer XD.  




 He has to be a little impatient...Italy probably has no idea what he's doing! 




 That might just break the internet...in the most awesome way possible.  
























 I can't upvote this enough.  




 I don't have to listen to you and your anarchy. 




 I wouldn't mind...it might actually be interesting seeing how this happens. The biggest of my concerns is the flags. They might just change the meaning of 50 stars is they're lazy enough.  




 _ So happy! No more grown men arguing like little girls! 




 Maximum health. And a bad ass cape. 




 [All I can think of.](http://http://imgur.com/CBuA4)

((NSFW)) 




 Well, Obama's got reddit's vote. He did an AMA *and* is encouraging us [to exit our internet hidey holes] to vote! 




 We find out in another story...he was crushed by a giant shipment of oranges and ladies in white dresses. 
Edit: I accidentally a word. 




 It's not filler nor canon. It's an extra. That's all. Fillers are put in just the anime, yet manga extras can still be in there, just not part of the plot. Fillers can end up being more relevant than extras.  




 I learned that trick from reddit-thank you for saving me from trying to use it and leaving someone with a hot, soapy, shit soup in their toilet.  




 I just literally say 'etc' if I have to because I can never remember how to say it.  




 Sent an email...got one back quickly. I let the conversation escalate before I commented though.

*Not sure where I should go with this conversation now. *
 




 This is quite an awesome build. I downloaded the world to get a better look. It's fantastic! 




 I've woken up right before my alarm and in my sleep induced drunk, I started panicking, wondering if I downloaded the right texture pack the previous night so I could get dressed, and then proceeded to look for my laptop in the bathtub. I wish I had a good excuse for that.  




 YES! Glad he won! 




 Thanks! 




 This takes patience and skill that I simply do not have. I applaud you.  




 I'm not Hispanic, but I'm rather advanced in Spanish. When I read things out loud I use proper pronounciation and accent, but there's always that idiot that says "stop acting Mexican!". So I have to dumb it down to heavy r's and d's.  




 The hill I go snowboarding at has a conveyor lift listed on the bunny hill. It must be new this year, since last year there were only ropes. Is this an actual conveyor belt for snowboarding/skiing? 




 WE NEED UPDATES!!! Unless you're dead...then that would be crazy...or this just annihilated the ending. Or Rose hacked him. Fuck...now I'm overthinking nosleep. 




 My radio likes to turn on on its own. All it does is make loud, irritating, static. Usually I don't mind...sometimes I'm even too lazy to get up and turn it off. When it does this in the middle of Rose's dialogue, I can't help but throw things at it in fear.  




 I am a native speaker and I thought that was a saying.  




 Repost of something posted 12 days ago.  




 Marilyn Manson. Horrible live.  




 Well that's a lot of nope!  




 How much are they?  




 Thank you for living a dream for those of us who stay in internet caves.  




 The curl and Gilbird says it all.  




 If I didn't know any better I would say she was a Hetalia fan. 




 Fuck cleanliness too.  




 Ugh..that's going to take a while...I guess that's payback for derping up. Thanks! 




 I accidentally changed my spawnpoint...twice. The first time I tried the command, I thought it would take me to my spawnpoint. Since I didn't go anywhere, I tried it again thinking I entered it wrong. Turns out, I changed my spawn point twice. Is there any way I can reverse this? (I'm in a superflat and have been searching the Nether for my portal. Haven't had any luck with that..) 









 One of the features of the update says that Herobrine was removed. Is Mojang trolling us or was Herobrine actually there? 




 ^_^ 




 Then a membership is definitely something I'm willing to invest in. Thanks! 




 If you have an Underground membership, can you download all of the previous CDs/order them? (LP8 is the best!) 




 "Oh shit...didn't they do that thing with Jay-z?"
Or
"Faggots. Why do you listen to that screamy emo shit?"
OR 
"FUCK YEEEEEEEEEEAH!" 




 I like guys who are just a bit too socially awkward than expected...not necessarily the type to sit at a computer all day, but more of the kind that's almost too shy to say hi to random people. (And OP's quirk: awesome.) 




 The other one is Project Diva~ 




 Would love to...but, there's a bit of an ocean in the way. But a meetup would be awesome! 




 Same here over in Wisconsin...the snow cam is so uneventful. 














 I know Hatafutte Parade, Mein Gott, Absolutely Invincible British Gentleman, and Excuse me, I'm Sorry were performed, but I'm wondering if there were any others as well.  




 I always tell people my dreams if they're interesting; and I hate being a hypocrite. But when people tell me about how 'demonic' or 'dark' their dream was, I usually get irritated. The only thing more irritating is when my friend tells me she doesn't dream and when she does it's a sign that something bad will happen and she should stay home and watch TV that day. 




 Do you get your period on both? And if so, at the same time? 




 We broke another website...overloaded. 




 Not all of them are wrapped in the plastic. I've seen them at bookstores open; they expect everyone to be mature and buy it or pirate the ebook before reading it in public. 




 I was wondering that too....it just disappeared. Nothing with 20000+ points just disappears. 




 We have a bunch of those in our science classroom. They're not plugged in though... 




 Found it again! 









 Yet the textbooks at my school are falling apart... 




 You lucky lucky female you,  




 It was! I could fly across it at a point. I took out my compass trying to find my way back to my spawn point. It told me my spawn point was right next to the huge thing! So I was dumb enough to fall out of the world...no such luck. Maybe I'll be lucky enough to come across something like that again. There were even diamonds in the caves! 




 There's trees on top too-a whole biome! 














 If someone took my bike like that, I wouldn't even be mad. They obviously deserve it more than me.  









 Licorice. It seems the whole planet loves it, and thinks Twizzlers are the best candy in the world, but I just can't seem to see how it tastes so fantastic.  




 Thanks!
 




 Okay, this seems like a really dumb question, but I was wondering if Minecraft had to be updated for anvils to be available, since I can't craft them.  




 I have that printer...it sucks shit. Can't even print out a simple document without screwing up.  




 My friend can't remember anything. It annoys the living hell out of me when she can't remember plans or something but can remember anything science and math related. If I hadn't met her brother, I would think she was full of shit. Even though sometimes I do anyways... 




 "Rowling would not rule out another book set in Voldemort-ville. But as far as "Harry's story is concerned," Rowling said, "I'm done." This is the part of the article that makes me excited.  




 What is your favorite bath and body works scent? How often do you use calculators? 




 http://i.imgur.com/XosMF.png
Well this is a fine discovery.  




 Buy Lucky Charms (cereal).  




 Sometimes I'll be looking through a photo album and she just drifts across the page. It definitely livens things up!
 




 Pinkie's~ 




 Most certainly! 




 What's your favorite kind of chicken? (My friend's been wondering.) 









 That's Soundwave before he was copyrighted as such. 




 No problem! 




 http://imgur.com/a/iTN5R#0 




 Posted! 









 In science, some kid started to explain how retarded it was that we had to study paramecium. Someone decided to reply with "Don't say retarded you fucking fag!" 




 Most certainly! 




 I am honestly impressed with this website; It has tracks from extremely well known artists to artists from overseas. Even character songs! This is definitely going into my favorites~! 




 So...I guess we broke another website.  




 The bubble wrap bag things came with Vault. I was so excited when I saw the package! 




 Whelp, I'm done eating for life.  




 But they're still sending deaf students to a concert...
