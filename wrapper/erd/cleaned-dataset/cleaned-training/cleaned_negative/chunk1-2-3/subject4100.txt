 I'm here to answer questions, mainly, but I do want to respond with one thing. Apostasy is something that is not supported anywhere in the Qur'an. What you are getting that fact from is the Hadith. The hadith are scriptures people wrote 200 years after the Prophet Muhammad died, and claimed he said this and that. The specific hadith this is coming from stated that if a muslim deconverts, kill him. 

That'd probably look true, if it didn't contradict the Qur'an itself. In the Quran, it is stated that killing a man is like killing humanity. The only two reasons it is justified in that text is when one is under attack and needs to defend himself, or if the man is causing harm humanity itself, under which a trial needs to be set forth with a judge. 




 Concerning your first link, these articles are mainly going into not what the Qur'an is saying itself, but what Islam itself has said about science, and how people of Islam have committed to modern science. One thing this article does say is that a group of people were saying that studying science from a point of nature leads people astray from 'God's path', which is completely disagreeable by me. reading these articles themselves, you can find that scholars and scriptures in Islamic history have condoned and encouraged to learn more about this universe we live in.

For the second link, I read the criticism of science in the Qur'an,and it all came down to evolution as the argument. This leads back to the book's statement that though life has evolved through natural selection, which is agreed both by modern scientists and the Quran today, humans had their own path of evolution. The criticism here is that the Qur'an is basically preaching Creationism. I don't see this as a case of complete creationism.  




 I do believe in this. I can give the verses from the Qur'an that actually support this statement. The exception was man in this common descent. Humans had their own descent, is what is basically believed by muslims. 




 I believe in evolution, and the fact that Homo Sapiens have indeed changed over time. The timeline in which Adam and Eve existed according to the Qur'an is thousands and thousands of years ago. They definitely did not look the same. The differing part here is that what the Quran states is that humans evolved in their own way. They were the ones who were different, having a conscience and a soul. Hopefully that answered your question. 




 An array of personal experiences and the thought that pretty much anything is just belief when one is something as small in this universe as a human. I chose not to state the fact that God is there and that I need to make sure everyone knows about this, but I chose to believe that it is possible he is there.

And by personal experiences I don't mean seeing Muhammad on my toast or anything. Hope that doesn't throw anyone off. 




 I actually finished the arabic translation of the Qur'an when I was 8, but I don't speak arabic. It's one of the reasons I never truly went tolearn about it in the first place. 




 I'll look into those readings, thanks!


And just out of curiosity, can you lead me somewhere that supports Islamic studies against science? 




 This I agree with. It was something I kept in mind while reading the Qur'an. What it stated in its text was, rather, that the universe itself was created within six days, and no mention of God resting was given, considering the fact that for something to be so divine, it must be perfect in its own way too. Though I think the six days phrase was given to give the people of Muhammad's time an estimate of how long it would take for Him to make something so vast.  




 For clarification, I was referring to the part where God created the earth 6000 years ago, and then put animals on land first. 

EDIT: To make things clear, I get that people are gonna bring up arguments against me, but if that happens, please give me something to argue with. If you disagree with the fact that it is parallell to scientific discoveries, then let me know how. Give context. I'm not downvoting anyone here, but don't take advantage of this and troll around. Let's actually talk. 




 I get what you're saying. But to me, if this is the case, then all religious people can be considered agnostic. They choose to believe in something divine and have their own ways of believing.

However, I also think this can apply to atheists as well. As much as many people can claim to know that there is no god, or a religious person can 'know' there is a god, it is beyond any human's capacity to know the truth. Like Carl Sagan has said, we are nothing but this pale blue dot. We can't ever truly know what caused this universe, but given the evidence and explanations we have, we can make a belief.

Stephen Hawking himself has said that there isn't a necessity for a divine being to have the universe created. A certainty for that, however, is still always debated. 




 Check conundri's comment for the response. 




 In short, yes. I am a religious person, but a big factor I want to highlight is that the main reason I returned to be religious was because the religion itself valued science. Your question's better answered in the response I gave to conundri somewhere in this thread. :) 




 So like I said, being a muslim and not knowing much about its background and logic caused me to look back at religion as a whole, and atheism as well.

I'd find time to try and learn different things and see what I fit with. For example, at a hotel I tried checking out the Bible, which resulted with me stopping after two pages of Genesis. 

As for Islam, I went back and read it's history, read the Qur'an in the many translations I could find. I read annotations, philosophies, and the writings of Islamic scholars. In the end, after choosing that God is real to me, Islam made the most sense for it. I'll answer any questions of the religion itself if you want to go into details.

One big thing, though, was the fact that Islam let me keep my belief in evolution. I was reassured by the fact that Islam was parallel to scientific facts and encouraged studying life straight from the Qur'an itself. 




 Pretty much the story. I've been raised as a Muslim, and had a point in time a year back when I turned agnostic and went into trying to learn everything I could of religious and alternative perspectives on life.

I've been a Redditor for almost a year now, and tend to visit r/atheism quite a bit along with other subs (you guys have my sense of humor). I haven't really seen many religious people having conversations with atheists that are as intellectual as I'd hope for them to be. Maybe I can answer your questions in a clear way considering I've been pretty open with both theist and atheist views. :)

EDIT: It's 12:30 AM here, and I have class in the morning. I promise I'll get to answering questions tomorrow, whenever time allows me to. Thanks to the few who are criticizing in their questions, but debate respectfully!  




 Haha, nah I get it now. I'm just sleepy.

Pretty much, I was 17, and around that age, pretty much everyone starts to question things. When one's learning, his mind is gradually taking in ideas that become more and more unfamiliar with what he's already used to. With me being raised as a Muslim, I never really went into studying other religions, or atheism itself. I'd always see atheism as this 'OMG HOW COULD YOU NOT BELIEVE IN GOD' thing, actually. 

But around that age, it was my turn to start questioning things. I started thinking that if I'm devoting my life to this one religion, I honestly don't know that much about it, and the things around me are making me feel like there might not be a divine being to begin with. At that point, when I wasn't sure, I was an agnostic.

Eventually, I wanted to find a place to settle, whether that be Islam or something else. I researched many sides, and to put it in short, I chose to believe in a god. Once that was over with, I settled at Islam  because it made sense to me.

Hope that answers it! 




 I think I'm doing both that and r/atheism. And I don't exactly get what you're referring to when you say 'why?'..

 Hah, no we've all been in that spot before. It happens with me, no worries. But I've gotten that a lot, that my drawings are really sketchy. In a way, I kind of go for that. I'd like to call it my style. My art teacher would always have to deal with it when we had to do natural, or photographic drawings. 

The whole caption thing isn't the idea of it though. What I'd do with the quote is design it around him. I made it more blank space for that, because otherwise it does look boring. It's more of a part of the sketch,  rather than a caption at the side if you know what I'm trying to get at. Thanks though, man! 




 I actually don't think that highly of it. I started on this thing two hours ago after wanting to do it for so long. This isn't really anything to make me feel like I'm bothering anyone here. You guys *are* the ones that choose what happens. Just downvote it if you think otherwise. 




 That's actually really interesting. 




 I love this one. I thought of it as well. I'm trying to pick out which might be the best. It was between this and the Captain Planet one that I can't decide for now, unless someone gives something different. 




 So I pretty much feel like this guy is about to make history, and I highly, highly respect what he does. I also like drawing. So I decided to put that stuff together. I have his portrait pretty much done (I wish I could have edited a few things, but I do my stuff in pen), but I want to add a quote and design it around the sketch in a way. 

tl;dr: **What's a good quote to design over a sketch of Julian Assange?**

It doesn't really even have to be from him. Anything emphasizing his message can be suitable. One I had in mind was the one from Captain America you guys upvoted a while back:

"When the mob and the press and the whole world tell you to move, your job is to plant yourself like a tree beside the river of truth, and tell the whole world - 'No, you move.'"

 **A Thousand Suns** - Linkin Park


Yeah, I said it. Downvote me. 




 Sharia law has become the cause of some of the worst ways to handle crimes in Islamic countries today. Not for what it stands for, but for what these guys have turned it into. I don't think there is one reasonable Islamic scholar helping countries like Iran out with their ways of law, or otherwise we wouldn't have shit like this happening: http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/nov/02/iran-stoning-sakineh-mohammadi-ashtiani
 
So we're gonna have people stoned for adultery, right? Because that's what the hadith, the said spoken words of the prophet Muhammad himself,  say in context to Sharia law? Alright then. Let's play it that way. Hopefully those countries still at least read how to do this whole stoning thing, right? Because what they've done so far is a completely half-assed job so far. Let's check the rules.
 
**1. If there's ever even a case for adultery, then there needs to be *four* witnesses of said case.**
 
But that's completely stupid, isn't it? Why in the world would two people ever have a legit affair in public? Especially in Iran? Oh, they just decided to get shit on in the middle of a public place in one of the most oppressed places in the East? I guess some people do roll that way. Okay, fine. So we have our criminals prosecuted. Let's get to the stoning?
 
**2. Only a sinless man may be the one to throw the stone.**
 
So here's where shit is supposed to go down. Except only someone who isn't guilty of sin themselves are allowed to throw the stone. Which is funny, because I've always thought we all are sinful. Aren't we? Isn't that the point of being human?
 
Damn, why was this stupid law even made? Why was this punishment made if we can't even get through with it? Is a divine being out there really hell bent on having his creations brutally murdered for being unfaithful? 

Or, to take a different way to look at it, was this law really made by a god who instead, made this punishment so hard to get to, that it has even other people look back at themselves before throwing that stone? Was this law simply made to give the human being a look on his own mistakes, before being the judge and executioner of someone else? By doing so, was this punishment even made to never be able to hit the criminals, the adulterers, leaving them to an open path to seek forgiveness?

If the latter, I seriously think it has been used in the wrong ways. From an outside perspective that takes a punishment like this at face value, it is one of the most barbaric rulings mankind has ever set, let alone a god. Then again, law was never made for stupid people. Everything has to be looked into, with detail. The above is the conclusion I came to about this ruling, which for me made it seem like it has reason embedded in it. To me, maybe these laws were set to be granted to a sane, responsible, and intelligent decision maker. I doubt those exist at all in the shithole of governments stationed in the Middle East.
 
So for the guys who control the way Iran works, take a good perspective at the way this whole stoning thing works. I really, really doubt one of you douchebags are completely clean yourselves. If not, I honestly pray you guys end up taking your own lives out of depression because there is absolutely no way you are benefiting life on this earth. If you were gone, life would be better preserved and protected. We are better off without you.
 
And don't call yourselves Muslims either. You guys sucked at that too, and you're making life harder as a Muslim for me.

/I know none of this may even get to the actual leaders. It just helps me focus when I actually direct the thing to the actual people. 




 I completely do. This guy's a great man and I'm glad he's getting attention. All I'm saying is he should have gotten it earlier. Before all this. 




 It is interesting, I agree with that. I guess I just feel irritated that it's when something this intense happens that we all of a sudden give him his spotlight. I would never, ever, ever hear of him like that back before he started hitting headline stories.

 Once I was walking to my car after working at a studio in school. A cop stopped and started driving idly next to me to ask me what kind of guitar I have. I told him, and he asked me if I know any Johnny Cash, who happens to be one of my idols. We then go off into a conversation that lasted a good five minutes, naming any songs by him, whether I can play them, the AMAZINGNESS of the Walk the Line movie. The cop then wished me a good day and drove off. 

Most of these guys really are just normal people doing what they gotta do. I've got respect. That conversation made my day.

I deleted it because it was getting downvoted for whatever reason. I call out my guy friends everytime they make another borderline pathetic "make me a sandwich" joke, and I make damn sure I respect everyone I have the pleasure to meet; man or woman.

But in case guys haven't noticed this either: *we* are part of the problem as well.

 I don't know about you, but reading this random submission on Reddit just slapped me in the face to get back up and work on my goals. Reading those words from his dad gave me hope in fulfilling my goals to be as good of a father as I can be in the near future.

 I don't listen to you guys much, other than your Umbrella cover, but my brother has always been a huge fan. Just wanted to say thanks for coming out and doing this. It's always awesome to see someone from a big band come out and take the heat from people on the internet to answer questions for their fans. 

My question is, I'm aspiring to be an artist sometime in the future as well. Either through music or film. What advice would you give for someone who doesn't necessarily want the fame or the big life, but to at least be heard for what he does?

Thanks! 




 I may not listen to All Time Low, but my younger brother happens to be one of their biggest fans, and he's always been the one to pick up after the shit his friends do, and look after his friends because of the stupid stuff that they do. He's the one who makes sure our family stays sane in times of tension, and he's always been there for anyone he loves. My brother is 16 years old, and I can already see more balls in him than I can see in you, if I was even to be given an entire biography on your predictably sad life. I'm willing to bet on that.

 Sorry for the incredibly late response. Studying took me over the past two days. But hopefully you read this.

Okay, so these passages were the passages I knew people would ask about, and there is good reason to. If I read something like this, I'd surely feel threatened too. So why is it in the Qur'an? The defenders of the Qur'an will always tell you you have to look into the context, but that's an overly stated and under-explained argument, in my opinion. I'll try giving you the full reasoning.

The Qur'an was not released as a book back in it's time. The Prophet Muhammad was given, so we believe, these passages over a series of an Islamic lunar month (which you may know today as Ramadan). They were speeches given to him by an angel named Jibrail who made him memorize these passages. This was a time of war for him and his people. It wasn't a great time for them either. People didn't like that Muhammad was speaking of the idols they worshipped as false, and that he was asking them to see that there is one creator of the universe. It turned into the dark ages for them. Muhammad's many family members and friends were actually killed and tortured for the sake of angering him. These conflicts escalated, and during that time, people looked to him for guidance because he's been their leader this far. They trusted him. 

The passages you gave (2.191-93) was given as speeches to him to guide his people down the right path as they entered this war. And the thing is, these attackers could have murdered their families beforehand, yet this passage specifically ensured that the Muslims kill only when they're being attacked. If anyone surrendered at all, then show no hostility to them. This passage wasn't given as an order to kill any disbeliever anyone sees, but an order to fight with defense against an army in a time of crisis.

To make the best metaphor I can out of this, imagine your parent's parenting history put into a book. Should I have gone back and read that your mom said "I'm going to beat you", I'd be all 'WHOAA. CALL CHILDRENS AID. NOW.'

The exception is when I would have to go back and read the history of what was happening at that moment, when you probably did something to get her mad. The main thing the Quran has in common with what one learns from his parents is that they both have issues that deal with everything. There's violence, and peace, but all of them are told through interconnected stories to bring through one message: be a good person. 

As for believing in god or going to hell, I have my thoughts on it as well. We all interpret our religions our own way, and I think that these people would have had the proff right there for them. They've seen Muhammad cut a moon in half, and miracles that would be unbelievable. The disbelievers in the time of this scripture tended to be unkind people, and I think the Qur'an, as well as any other scripture, stated that if one has seen the truth, but chooses not to believe it, would await whatever judgement that god sets on him. In the end, I honestly think it comes down to be a good person, and to help humanity. The Quran gave passageways that explained not to ever forcefully place an ideology, even Islam, onto a person, and Muhammad carried this out by making Constitutions with monks and christian villages that established freedom of religion. But that's just my two cents on it.

I'll end this with another passage that can hopefully sum up howthe Quran is not a book of rules and guidelines on a list, but rather a series of stories from times of hardship and basic human problems and the morals we must overall learn from them, whether we believe in a God or not. 

  If anyone slew a person unless it be for murder or for spreading mischief in the land it would be as if he slew the whole humanity: and if anyone saved a life it would be as if he saved the life of the whole humanity.

This was one passageway that allowed me to choose this religion if I'm going to believe in a god. I like the fact that it's struggling for the better of humanity as a whole.

Let me know if i made anything unclear. Again, sorry for being so late!

 




 Wow man. You're a douchebag. 




 Your friend was trying to match it together to make it seem as if God really did just want us to decrypt the science out of the book. My view is basically the assumption you made of the Quran being a metaphorical book of signs. And by the way, please don't hesitate to ask me on any passage, nasty or not! I want to do the best I can at explaining those too. And thanks for being respectful while making criticism. :) 




 Which is why i read it first. I simply said translation to clarify that I read it in Arabic. Sorry for the misunderstanding. :\ 




 I do think that is a valid assertion, like the many subreddits we have here, people see things in their own ways, and people fit text with meanings to see something in their way. I've done this myself.

To make it clear, nothing ever convinced me that God (or Allah) is real. I am not at a point where I know for sure that there is a god. I was faced with a simple question: whether there is a God or not. From everything I've known and experienced, I chose to *believe*. Choosing Islam was a second step. Basically, it supported what I *wanted*: belief in a divine creator, and the fact that religion and science can come together. I gave it the most recognition. It made sense to me. This won't be the case with everyone. 




 I think I spoke in the wrong way. I was trying to state that it was brought up in a metaphorical way. Agreeing with what you said.

I think in order for humans to understand something so great, metaphorical poetry was necessary. It's a way to connect. The Quran is not a book of science, but a book of understanding the picture. Science is the anatomy which we have been told to study. 




 I like this. 




 I don't think you understood the part where I said during my agnostic phase, I was studying everywhere about this. Agnosticism = knowledge. I get it. AMA still relevant. 

And sorry, but r/atheism isn't some secret club where you need to present yourself in a certain way to be 'accepted' by the community. People come, people talk, regardless of belief, if it's on the topic of atheism. I came here to hopefully give people a better idea of what a religious guy can be like. I'm not an asshole. I came to talk like one would at a bar. Thanks.

I don't think all religious people are as easily offended as you think they are. 




 Another person replied to you talking about how Lasers basically sounds like the studio made the album for him. It's because they did. Lupe Fiasco was in a legal battle with Atlantic for about a year or so before they would even let him release Lasers because of their disagreements over what should be on it. Lupe himself has not only admitted, but spoken out on his dislike for Lasers. 

I went to a concert of his about a year before Lasers came out, and it was a concert actually promoting the then-expected album. The T-shirts for the tour had something called 'The Lasers Manifesto' written on the back. Look it up if you have the time, because it really is a nice message to see on the back of the shirt other than just the tour dates.

Basically, Lupe hated his own album, and promised his fans that the next one will be what both he and the fans wanted. 

And with that, I ask you to listen to his newest album: Food and Liquor II. It'll definitely change your mind on whether he's still an amazing lyricist or not.

Let's have a toast for the real terrorists out there: a toast to the conservative talk radio hosts that fill the minds of idiots up with ideologies that every brown skinned turban-wearing citizen in our country is out to destroy our beautiful country. Thank you, again, for setting more people out there to act like dogs on their unjustified hatred for people who don't look, dress, or live the same way they do. They couldn't have done it without your help. 




 I'll post mine. [J. Robert Oppenheimer's commentary, after having witnessed the destruction his atomic bomb can cause, is short and powerful.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8H7Jibx-c0) I can't imagine what he felt at that moment. 




 I'm not asking for a video based simply on gore or shock value. I'm also not necessarily asking for something that can find itself onto an episode of Ghost Hunters. I want you guys to post a video that truly hit you to the core; something that made you realize how destructive and scarred people can make the world, or themselves. 




 OP here. This was posted on Facebook by one of my friends in Jordan. Even he thought this was ridiculous for what he usually sees. I'm a Pakistani-American myself so I tend to see some crazy drivers over there as well. 

But this.. uh. 




 You must be a really cheerful guy in person.

Oh, and the person that shot this picture took it in Jordan. Your shallow comments shouldn't even offend anyone because you obviously have no clue what you're talking about. 









 Are you sure you're not just listening to the preview? The song's over 8 minutes in length.. 




 Are you sure you're not just listening to the preview? You do realize the song is over 8 minutes in length, right..? 




 Oh hey! Something else I had no earthly clue existed until a Redditor brought attention to it! 




 Whenever I get impatient about something and someone says something along the lines of "Don't worry, just wait.", I instinctively cut them off with "I DID MY WAITING. TWELVE YEARS OF IT.


IN **AZKABAN**." 




 It's 5:44 AM, and I'm laughing more than I should have been when I got to Schumacher. 




 ...Well, fuck you too! 









 If you want to be rest assured with how much difference there can be between the quality of a movie and it's poster, take a look at these two:

Now let's all chill out. 




 I wanna feel Joseph Gordon Levitt.

 So we'll hunt him. 




 WHAT DID EVERYONE SAY? 




 Hey, um.. TL;DR. 




 This isn't Twitteritis. Please don't post your daily activitoses here.

 Guys, let's focus on the game here. 




 This is a bit late, but I'm the guy that originally wrote this picture. The original post is in my username history. Yeah, it's Plano, Texas. 




 It's like DanielOnFilm said in this thread. Pixar's characters have identity. It's not sound editing, or anything being extra done by the voice cast. The characters are simply written brilliantly. 

I'm the other way around because of it. I can't watch any other Tom Hanks movie without thinking about Woody in the middle of Omaha Beach or trying to capture Leonardo DiCaprio. 




 (Dat mean he luv her moar den 4eva) 




 JUST STAY OFF THE SET YOU FUCKING PRICK. 




 Yep, that was my intention. Somewhat of a remake of that storyline. I've given it more of a Middle-Eastern/South Asian influence to replace the Irish influence given in the Scorcese movie.

Thanks! 




 Thank you! Working on it. 









 Into the West - Howard Shore and Annie Lennox. I'm pretty sure it's the only song to ever have made me cry. 




 Out of all the changes that have happened in the time between the release of *Blink-182* and *Neighborhoods*, what was/still is one of the hardest things to deal with personally and professionally for you as a band member and as a friend?


And thank you for giving me the soundtrack to my youth and more than I can say. 




 Fuck 




 Inna lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji'oon. I hope her family pulls through this with as much ease as possible. 




 WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? MR FREEZE WASN'T EVER IN A BATMAN MOVIE.  




 You're the exact kind of person I intend to make sure my kids never grow up to be. 




 Gotham. Come nightfall, Bale's city is mine. And anyone who's in it plays by my rules. 




 Oh, and obligatory Salam handshake from another Muslim college kid. :) 




 I just choked on a Samoa from seeing Christian bale in a hijab. Thank you.  




 yes 




 Lmao Jeremy 




 Still seems more enjoyable than the Crystal Skull.. 




 See post taking off for Karmastan.

Think of something clever to board flight.

Think nothing
Bear pun 




 I'm 19 now. I've been playing the piano for 11 years. The first couple years or so, I always told people how much I love playing the Plano. 




 I know who you're talking about too. I FEEL SO EMPOWERED.
