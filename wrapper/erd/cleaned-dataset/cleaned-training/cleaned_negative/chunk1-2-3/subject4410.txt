 100% agree 




 Has there ever been a player close to, equal to, or better than Lebron at making players around him better? JR's resurgence and emergence as a weapon on this team, I believe, is completely the Lebron effect. Like, him and Bron can go off together and just dominate a game as a duo. He does the same thing with Kyrie and did the same thing with Wade or Bosh. Even back to Mo Williams when he was an all star, that was all the Lebron duo effect. Takes a 33 win team to number one in vegas odds to win the chip the day he signs... single-handedly changes franchises. Just curious to see what you guys think! 




 well shit, id be itchin to come to cleveland now too that theyre relevant again

 But most important, are you 12... or 13? 




 Very, *veeeeerry* important crack 




 And that sir, is why you are wrong.  




 Yeah, talking to him. That doesnt mean anything. He could have been recruiting for when he is a free agent. He does that with plenty of players 




 You're right... but, what if? maybe 7..... 




 This isnt a movie and i dont care. 
McConaughey in True Detective. Not a single soul could have done that the way he did it. perfectly done 




 yeah, science bitch 




 dude, dont bring that up. i have to live the rest of my life as a steelers fan saying "what if Tebow didnt torch us for an 80 yard TD bomb to win the game in OT?" 




 yeah that series was an anomaly. i was at game 4 and you could tell he wasnt in the right place. he honestly looked like he was playing a game he had never played before. but other than that series, all he has been in clutch. never understood this 




 KD was gettin up there for me this year just bc of his twitter crap and his "you can play me for it" shit about his all star bid. like, you didnt earn that, at least be grateful. but, i cant blame a guy whos had frustrating injuries like that after an MVP season. 

Westbrook will have to do 




 dude, come on. none of this is remotely accurate 




 OH MY GOD I KNOW. LIKE, THIS IS PROFESSIONAL BASKETBALL. ACT LIKE AN ADULT GOOD GOD 




 Who said he does...? 




 So Kyrie and Dion and old Varejao were his golden ticket? Come on man...  




 MJ had/has the same cult following. But, I agree about him getting away with offensive fouls sometimes. However, the dude gets hit in the face on drives all the time and never gets a call bc he isnt effected by it bc he's so big. I think him getting away with pushoffs and hooks is refs making up for missing him get hip checked in the air 




 Yeah, because that totally isn't classless at all and the exact same thing they did to Dirk..... 




 For real. Just get it all out, no need to hold back. We're all friends here 




 Screw Boozer. He's one of the most annoying players ever 




 Sounds on purpose 




 my heart likes it a whole lot 




 Im a white dude who lives in a city and i just pre ordered it. Is that good or bad? 




 How many are there for real? The commercials make it seem like there's a lot.  




 Reese wasnt in gone girl bruh 




 Welp. He's resting this game so I guess the back situation is more real than I thought 




 Hopefully he rests. Good time for him to grab some extra rest. Also, would love for Love to have just a giant game to get him back in the swing of things. We will need him come May 




 Even if Lebron isnt the MVP, he will get the MVP. after everything, it's the fairytale ending the league and the team and he wants 




 I like this one. Scariest teams are gonna be 5-8 




 youre telling me a Paul George, who hasnt played all season, is going to come back in the lineup and not kill their chemistry AND play like a star against the best player in the world? Cavs in 4, moving on.  




 Rockets dont get past first round. Warriors dont make it past the second round. Blazers and Spurs the dark horses to make it to the Finals. Cavs win finals in 5 games against whoever they play.  




 I don't even think it's that. it's how dangerous it is to have something that distracting on the road, right? i mean, it is a powerful message and all but dang, poorly placed.  




 10/10 would dump 




 Lilly even says smokes sandwiches. Like, come on 




 We would also destroy them one on one right now 




 Yes, all of this, but also what the hell was goin on with Mozgovs hands tonight? mighta been just me but it looked like he couldnt catch anything 




 He WILL be an MVP in the future. No question about it with that ball handling and finishing ability. Not to mention that 3 point stroke!! Damn 




 I think 3-9 against teams over .500 is the only argument you need 




 When in reality, he brought in over 150 mil to the Heat in 12-13 alone.  









 Dumbledore Mt. Everest  




 Vince, T-Mac, Marc 




 It would make for some playoff series with more fire and intensity. Nobody is gonna like gettin called out by the one seed. i like it 




 It's the "idea" of an escape tho that draws people to it 




 That's why. Earth sucks sometimes, so lets see how it is out there. It's an escape 




 Yeah OKC is like a +36 with him off the floor and -24 with him on past few games. Not MVP-like to me 




 hahaha bruh. hop outta here with that Teague stuff.  




 never works for me. stimulates my mind 




 Worst win percentage in the league without him in uniform. I think that speaks volumes 




 He's carrying them offensively, but they're better defensively with him off the floor. I also just dont see the league giving an MVP award to a (maybe) 8 seed.

 BRUH me too. this was that 8th grade basketball pre game hype track 




 yeah, i think he's the guy who can slay anybody on a song but just isnt as popular to the average fan.  




 exactly. drake changed the genre to an extent so saying he cant make a classic is near sighted. if his career ended today he would still be known as a complete game-changer with tons of bangers that everyone knows 




 Interstellar. Made me think deeply about things I had never thought about, question things i always thought were solid fact, and shed tears at how emotional it was. Something about him being the same age as his daughter and missing her entire life while only being gone, in his time, for a very short period. Awesome movie 




 Literally none of these work.

 I love that bang 




 past few games it feels like thats been our entire offense. pisses me off. run a play 




 yeah im just confused about the whole nonchalant nudity thing happenin here 




 Lebron deserves it over everyone. He's the best player on the planet. But, I'm 85% sure he won't get it regardless of how out of his mind he plays until the middle of june because people just want someone else to get it. Like DRose a few years ago. Yeah right 




 Neil Patrick Harris as The Riddler
Johnny Depp as a character like John Cusack played in Frozen Ground
Will Smith as a Bond villain somehow
Bryan Cranston as literally any character in anything because he's the best. But I wish he could have been Lex Luthor in this Batman v. Superman comin out. 
I would watch Matthew Mcconaughey be his True Detective character forever so if he played a guy like that but motivated by evil, I'd be down.  




 haha lebron is the most clutch player in the league. just look at the clutch-time stats. bleacher report did a story about the clutchest players in the league and it's not even close

 Woah. This just put the whole season into perspective. Bravo 




 coulda sworn she was gonna kill herself. like 4 different times I thought "this is it. here it is" but no. slightly disappointed but also intrigued to see where they go next. that one lady claire talked to with the baby said that she (claire) should be president and Claire had a distinct "I'm intrigued" look on her face.

Can someone remember the name? I cant for the life of me 


































 Under Pressure goes hard. Logic is gonna be big 




 Miles Teller is a great actor. I'm lookin forward to this movie 




 Yeah but he can make those regardless. Best player on the planet has to make difficult jumpers in the playoffs 




 What's wrong with Lebron's jumper? Dude just can't find it. Hope that shapes up as we head through the playoffs 




 it's a bad angle.  




 It makes me so sad. Like, you're huge. Get on the block, the actual block not this 18 feet away from the rim post ups, and jump hook the shit out of em.  




 Kyrie is the most unguardable player in the league off of pick and rolls. You go under, he splashes a 3. You go over, he's goin to the rack where he's the best finisher in the league. You hedge hard, he's splitting you for a 4 on 3 advantage where he is probably gonna get a bucket. Crazy 




 SO FINE UUUGGHHHHHH 




 its been bad 




 Except for his inability to jump through people and dunk the ball. He's got some weight lifting to do this off season 




 Our defense is just plain awful right now. I'm sad.  




 my point is no one is that consistent. regardless of the level of competition, no one has been that consistent for that long  




 To say it isn't impressive to never have a bad first round series in an entire career is insane.  




 All the "bc hes in the east, come to the west and see if that stays" crap is stupid. 5 years from now, the East is gonna have the 60+ win teams and 8 seeds that have 50+ wins and the west will have sub .500 teams in the playoffs. It flips back and forth, always has always will 




 Not impressive to never get bounced in the first round? You serious? 




 I think Kyrie Irving is going to be the most outstanding player in the league until the Finals start. There's just something about the way he plays that makes him seem like a guy who can really succeed in the all-eyes-on-you playoff stage and with that kind of intensity. Big game player.

 scratch my hatch 




 As is the case with CB, when you get twice the shots, you'll score points. That's not a very difficult concept to grasp 




 Don't tell me 14 pts a game from Wade on a bum knee is contributing. And I never questioned Bosh's pick and roll defense. I agree, he is excellent at that. Guarding big men, however, is another story. He got cooked by Roy Hibbert(!!!) 2 years in a row before *Udonis *Haslem was put on him and shut him down. And he couldn't guard Duncan, or Splitter for that matter, two years in a row. 

All of those things aside, when I say Lebron carried them, I'm not wrong. He led the team is scoring, rebounds, assists, and steals for nearly 4 full years. He was the best defender in the league, regardless of who got the award, for 2-3 of those years. so he had to guard the likes of DRose, KD, Tony Parker, Paul Pierce, Paul George, etc. all while leading the offense in every statistical category there is. Yes, DWade contributed at times and yes, CB helped spread the floor and in p r situations defensively, but outside of that, it was '09/'10 Cavaliers all over again. 

But, I greatly appreciate you actually contributing information and making a logical argument. Most people just throw aimless comments out there and hope they stick.  




 i disagree. i also think it's ridiculous to still be upset with him about that. that's the only questionable thing he has done since he was 17 years old. he is a stand-up guy who has always gone above and beyond for his community. and even when he was in Miami, you knew he always wanted to be back home. to not forgive him for essentially going off to college before realizing he was meant to stay home is just immature.   




 I would love to hear your reasoning instead of just a blind statement.  




 Uhh... he did. Just because he was getting, what, 22 and 10 before he had the lung issues doesn't mean he isn't past his prime. He was getting twice as many shots and was the unquestionable focus of the offense every time down the floor this season. You're bound to have better numbers when you get twice the shots. But prime Bosh? That was in 2011 when he would routinely get 30 and 15. When Lebron and Wade were out, he would drop 40+ and single-handedly win games. You won't see that from him again 




 He did. He doesn't score those easy points unless Lebron is on that team.  




 Prime Wade and Bosh left after 2011. Wade was hurt from '12 to now and Bosh became a jump shooter who couldnt defend 5's, which is what he had to play bc that team had no size. Lebron carried those teams and it's not even an argument.  




 wait so lebron isnt even in your top 5? _ 




 I just want a realistic spider-man. Like, why is he so witty and funny? Didn't Robin Williams say the funniest people are the ones hurting the most or something like that? Make Uncle Ben's death dark. The whole thing dark. Like The Dark Knight dark. I want him to resort to humor because he's depressed and fight crime to try to *AVENGE his uncle's death. I dont want the same old high school stuff we've seen. Reinvent it. Make it new. I want him to do bad things to criminals because he's so angry. I want dark humor at first until he realizes what he actually needs to do to with his ability. I want Captain America to be integrated somehow and sort of take him under his wing and show him how to be responsible with his abilities. I want Captain to tell him "With great power comes great responsibility," echoing what Uncle Ben told him previously, only this time it actually clicks. Finally, I want him to become an *Avenger. But only because he has earned it and struggled through the pain to become one.

 That's not what I mean. Just the whole homecoming, fairy-tale kind of season it would be if they make it all the way and win. He'd be a hero and even if he didn't have the best series individually, he would get the award.  









 No matter who has the best series, Lebron will get the MVP. It's one of those storybook ending kinda things 




 I would! Currently on my phone though so the flash doesnt work. Definitely using that in the future though! 




 Not watching the game bc league pass is too damn expensive, but is lebron just not shooting well or is he missing easy shots or what? seeing him shoot 5 of 14 always makes me angry 




 I just feel like we all need some evidence as to how incredible dat ass is before we judge this man for his innocent compliment.... lol 




 and people be gettin mad at me sneezin 5 times in a row in class.

 I was frozen solid in my seat watching that. Didn't move an inch. So incredibly mesmerized by all that scene took and how expertly executed it was.  




 A Time to Kill. come on, now 




 haha he was so awesome to me as that character. so believable. just crazy enough 




 yes. i understand what it is technically. all im saying is, in terms of quality, this is only a mixtape. hence the excitement for, what he calls, his album.  




 What im saying is, he didnt put the work/effort into this "mixtape" as he calls it as he will for his actual album. and i got screwed then bc mine said 14.99.  




 It was actually more than that, so your argument is invalid. And he literally said it was a mixtape. Only on sale to get out of his CM deal. Come on, keep up son

 but, can you throw it over your shoulder? 




 hahah ring back tones. those were the shit 




 I can see him resting em for the last game. Other than that, I think he'll play em. This year is just different with the playoff road ahead. Won't be as grueling in the East but also the pressure to win I think will effect Blatt's resting method. He'll want to maintain the rhythm and flow of the rotation going into that first round, imo 




 He's in my top 5 most hated players in the league. Dude has hated Lebron forever because he always gets stomped by him.  




 My favorite is "You sir, have a small penis" and then a detailed cartoon drawing of a man with a monocle looking down from above the urinal.  




 hahaha get tf outta here 




 i think they probably have a pretty good relationship. as much these kinds of stories suck, lebron knows better than anybody that stories like this are gonna happen regardless. i mean, he's known the dude since high school 




 the whole "spaghettified" thing is being debunked right now. Physicists arent sure if that is what would actually happen or not.  




 Id still give it to Aldridge just because he'll never get it again bc Davis is gonna run the league from here on out

 It's actually incredibly useful for recovery and energy. Have a place like that in my town, used it before and after every game last year. It's insane how much spring you get in your step 




 Ive said it before, I'll say it again: Mike Miller is going to be huge these first two games. He'll spread the floor offensively and he can guard Mirotic or Dunleavy. I know his shot has been off when he's played this season, but he is a playoff performer. Look out for MikeMillMadeIt come Monday 




 Am a white kid from Texas who didn't have the daddy money to buy a car with. Can confirm. Nobody actually cared about anything if it didnt have to do with them. The reason I listen to the kind of rap that actually says something about life is bc i have no clue what that life is like. I actually wrote a paper about it this semester, and I just basically like seeing life from different perspectives and trying to understand from a distance what people are going through bc i have no idea what that life is like. 
Anyway, I'd like to apologize for the jackasses who didnt give a shit. All us white kids aren't like that, I promise.

 *hole 




 I dont want this theory to hinge on Bruce pulling something Batman-ish out of his ass. I think Nolan showed Selina Kyle in that scene just to mess with the audience and make us question everything we just saw, exactly like the end of Inception. I just find it extremely hard to believe that Bruce either got the bomb out far enough from the city and somehow escaped the blast radius himself in that small amount of time, or used the auto pilot to take the bomb out which would mean that everything we see of him in the aircraft is fake. Just doesnt make sense. Makes a lot more sense for him to sacrifice himself to protect the city he has dedicated his life to protect and for Nolan to throw Bruce and Selina in that last scene just to fuck with us. For me, that was Alfred seeing what he always wished he would see every time he went there. Completely in his head.  




 No, the ship was not put in autopilot. It simply said the auto pilot had been fixed.  




 That Bruce Wayne is alive and Alfred actually saw him at the restaurant in Paris. Bruce Wayne died. He sacrificed himself for the city, as it was always intended. What Alfred saw is what he always hoped to see when he went there. That's what that scene meant. He was, once again, seeing what he wanted. But Bruce died. Period.  




 I just hope he has to deal with that disgustingly thin "goatee" for the rest of his life. talk about shame 




 Always imagine this track playing behind a video of like slow-mo phantom cam nba highlights. The beat just reminds of somethin like that. cant explain why 




 No. Just saying that he has the ability to defend guys like mirotic, as i said, and spread the floor offensively for Kyrie and Lebron. It's really not that hard of a concept to grasp 




 Ocean's 11, 12, and 13. But mostly 11 




 Guarantee Miles Teller will win one. He's going to develop into a phenomenal actor 




 YES. AGREED. THANK YOU 




 Iman Shumpert is expected to play well. Mike Miller isn't. Therefore, him playing well is the unexpected X factor.  




 I promise I'm not! Just watch. He'll come up big in this next series 




 Mike Miller is the X factor in our playoff run from here on out. I saw it in Miami, I see it now. If he can hit 3's like he has in playoffs of old and if he can defend like he has in the past, he's a game changer. He is a guy who has been through it all before with Lebron and knows where he needs to be at critical points in a game. He's 6 foot 8 so he can guard some 4's who tend to stay outside (mirotic, for example) and he can rebound the ball too. If Blatt actually plays him, he can genuinely affect games.  




 Why can I only see the To Pimp A Butterfly album cover when I look at pictures of these protests? 




 More optimistic about our chances in the East? Absolutely! At winning a title? Not so much. If Kevin indeed tore his labrum and has tendon damage, he might not be back at all. Especially since he would be banging that shoulder in the post all game. and ESPECIALLY since he can be a free agent. I just don't know if we can beat, say the warriors, without him. If he can play (and chooses to) i 100% think we can win it all. but he has to play 




 We can beat either team without Kevin. Neither team is playing well and both have weak points. Guys, I'm excited 




 Heat beat the post-heavy Pacers without Bosh. Cavs can win without Love. Gonna be tough and it'll take everything Lebron and Kyrie have, but it can be done 




 Didn't he sign like a 6 movie deal? Cap 3 would be number 5... 




 Mike Mill is gettin pt this series. Lebron knows who he is in the playoffs (game 5 in '12, 7 3's, shoeless 3 against the spurs) and he's is gonna make sure he plays. The only issue i see is our starting lineup. we have to match pau and noah so tt and moz have to start. cant spread the floor with that. so we have to wait for the bulls to put a smaller guy in before we can have a lineup that suits our strengths. in other words, we cant make the first move. we'll be adjusting to what they do instead of the other way around. still think we got em tho 




 Hopefully Leron doesn't throw up clankers for 3 quarters before he realizes he can just drive past anybody and score. But if anyone can get it done, it's Lebron and Kyrie 




 Yeah Kevins mad. He's playing as soon as possible. and losing JR isn't going to be huge for however many games it ends up being. I think we'll see a lot of Mike Miller next series and a lot more post up Lebron. I'm not worried about this series honestly because we have all the pieces to win. If guys like James Jones, Mike Miller, Kyrie, And Shump all hit shots, we'll be fine. Plus, I don't trust DRose to do anything 




 Hahahah yo that's hilarious. That's how it was for that Heat team against the Hawks too. But yeah, things are different now. Winning this next series with injuries and suspensions will just cement his legacy tho 




 basketball reference.com. literally showed it on screen during the game. in the NBA, when a dislocated shoulder is listed as the cause of injury to a player, the average number of games missed is 27 games. However, I am not saying Kevin will be out for 27 games. I am saying that, on average, that's how many games are missed by players during the regular season. and yes, if there's no ligament or tendon damage then of course it wont be that long.  




 Average games missed by NBA players with same injury: 27 games.  




 This is the dumbest comment in this whole thread.  




 this is fucking atrocious 




 agreed 




 bend him over a table 




 james jones is fucking terrible today. get him out of the damn game 




 you clearly didnt watch him the past 5 years. Especially last year in memphis. dude locked people down for long stretches of games. and again, you clearly dont know mike miller. he could shoot 0 for 500 in the regular season and come into a playoff game and go 7 for 7. he is a big game, big shot maker 




 MIKE MILLER AND SHAWN MARION NEED TO BE PLAYING IN THIS GAME. MIKE IS A 3 AND D GUY AND MATRIX IS A SLASHER/POST UP GUY EHO DEFENDS AND REBOUNDS. I DONT UNDERSTAND 




 This game is hard to watch at best. So much settling and stupid shots and isolations and bad defense and fouls and im sad now

With a little research, you too can find the pictures of him on set actively filming a scene in his costume and make up without a big ass tattoo on his forehead! Woohoo! The internet is awesome! In the words of Walter White, "Fuck you, and your eyebrows!" ass.  




 Yes! I feel the same way! I loved the original ones at the time but upon comparison I thought Garfield was just more spiderman like 




 Let me clarify, the acting wasn't bad. But Spiderman wasn't convincing. Like somebody said farther down the comments, Tobey was a better Peter Parker but the Garfield guy was a better spiderman. I just didnt like the spiderman depicted 




 Exactly 




 Yes, she wasn't hot. Just cause she's soaked and her tits are showing doesn't make her hot. MJ is supposed to be an unattainable level of hotness. She, clearly, is not.  




 Jerry Maguire:
Miles Teller as Jerry
Emma Stone as Dorothy
Anthony Mackie as Rod
Margot Robbie as Avery
Channing Tatum as Cushman
Tom Hiddleston as Bob Sugar
 




 Holy shit. Why is this not a movie yet 




 He doesnt have the tats in the movie. that was just for the promo pic 




 "How many.. of your friends... have I killed?"
"Would you like to know.. which of them were cowards?" 




 Fight Club. Like, it was okay. I guess when it was released it was probably a big twist-at-the-end thing people hadnt really seen before (speculation cause i have no clue. im 19) but I just didn't get the hype.  




 I thought Garfields version was much more Spiderman-like than Tobey's.  




 Acting was bad. MJ wasn't hot. Only thing good about it was the villain. 

Let the roasting commence.  




 Yeah thats cool, but how is that end result achieved? 




 HAHAHAHAH AMERICAN PSYCHO!!! PATRICK BATEMAN IN THE FLESH!! HE HACKS HIS FACE IN WITH AN AXE TO "IN THE AIR TONIGHT" SHORTLY AFTER 




 A Few Good Men and Jerry Maguire are his two favorite. Pretty much slips a line from each one into conversation every day. I also love those movies, probably because of him 




 Azizi Gibson, anybody have any good stuff? I know Claustrophobia and Backward Books, but that's it. Really feelin the beats to those two 




 I encourage all daughters to kiss they mothers, with those lips that all that lipstick covers, you're never too grown up to miss and hug her 




 Yo, this is Drakes song. Not a verse from Ross's song. He put his out way earlier and Ross asked for it 




 Exactly what I was thinking. Dude always looks so pissed off at those people.  




 Well, correct me if I'm misinformed, but I believe a clock operator is the guy who operates the damn clock so fuck you and your sarcasm, dumb idiot. 

Archer voice, obviously 




 Selfie. bae. thats all 









 rekt 




 But how? 




 Confirmed.

 There is no better sound in sports than a perfect swish 




 but but but... where are the scars???  I WANNA KNOW HOW HE GOT THE SCARS 




 thanks fam 




 Hey can somebody post the post game interviews for those of us in a college dorm with no NBA TV...... 




 He said "I packed it" one time too haha 




 HAHAHAH HYPE TRAIN 




 Read that in Dave Francos voice from neighbors when he's doin that impression with jigsy cat 




 Holy fuck. That was incredible. That's gonna be an Oscar worthy Johnny Depp performance 




 LoL 




 Anybody know when some new Drake is coming out? Seems like pretty soon would be a good time since he is trying to recover from the bad reviews he got about his Coachella sets.  




 Kate Beckinsale, here here 









 That would be the sickest thing ever. Loved Treasure Planet when i was a youngin

 get outta here. he didnt give him a chance to land. look at the feet 




 Sallgood, man 




 Lebrons gotta step up next half. Been playin like hes been to 4 straight finals and is tired or something..... 




 I think that half showed how important JR making shots is for our offense. If he isn't hitting, our spacing is bad and we go iso and settle for stupid shots way too much.   




 Lead at the half.  upvotes for everybody 




 well fuck me. im too filled with rage to realize we said the same thing. apologies fam 




 he looks lost 




 No, he's either settling or too passive. He's driving to pass, not to score. which is infuriating.  




 oh god. she's younger than me. oh god oh god oh god. does this mean i have a chance?!??? 




 Some of that Inception, city turning over on itself stuff was dope too 




 I feel like this is an understood thing about the movie.  




 This song will forever be in any top 5 drake list. gold
