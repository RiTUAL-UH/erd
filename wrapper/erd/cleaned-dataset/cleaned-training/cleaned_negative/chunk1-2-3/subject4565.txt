 *Do You Think I'm Saxon?*    
Mother of God... 




 It still has yet to release most markets outside the U.S. 




 Nope. Still Marvel Studios productions. 




 That's what the glitched memories are intentionally called, yeah. 




 If I'm not mistaken, Jak X came out in 2005, so that fits as well. I have heard that they were working on Uncharted since *during* Jak 3's development. 




 X-Men: First Class had a great score. 




 [Frankenstein's Monster](http://youtu.be/6oIUOqK_er8) from X-Men: First Class is iconic for that film. 




 I mean, everyone eventually dies. He was a pirate. It's kind of inevitable. 




 I agree with this so hard. Vidic's monologues were fantastic. 




 That's not what I meant. 




 Which one? 




 Still, a director should know how basic comedic timing for a comedy works. The Earth segment at the beginning is faithful on paper, but in tone it's completely different. 




 I think it was directed with terrible comedic timing. Every line had no room to breathe. It's like they were in a rush to get through all of the jokes, some of which lacked their brilliant set-up from the book; punchlines aren't a joke. 




 She's hardly in it. 




 You unlock previous squadmates with tokens earned in the combat sim. You invite individual members up before the party by selecting "invite *****".  




 Jack and Jill and Blended were widely maligned. 




 What? No. 




 only 




 That's the spirit. 




 "Netflix rhymes with wet chicks" was only one of many moments that prove Sandler is only in it for the money these days. 




 In that sense, I'm glad they showed it. It was bloody amazing. I'd still expect at least one controlled set piece in the game like the cargo plane. It's what the series is known for. 




 I'm just kinda glad they didn't spoil any big action set pieces (like the train and the cargo plane from 2   3). I know some people wanted that, but I'd really rather experience it myself. 




 And that's my only gripe, which is pretty good for Rogue. 




 Saleswise, prob not well, but as a sequel to Black Flag it's pretty good. Only complaint is that the amount side content waaaayyyyyy outweighs the amount of story content. 




 All Blacks hater, I presume? 




 Far Cry and Rogue weren't bombs at all. 




 [Here's the latest news, from February.](http://m.ign.com/articles/2014/02/10/director-jaume-collet-serra-says-live-action-akira-still-a-go) Read the last paragraph of the interview. It's a bit racist.     
Plus, Oldboy the movie is Korean, based on a Japanese manga. The American remake is based on this film. 




 They're proper Blu-ray  sets available from JB Hi-Fi in Australia and New Zealand. Those are all labelled with Australian ratings, so they're from Australia. 




 Actually, I'd bet most people would know her as the best friend in Confessions of a Shopaholic.    
/s 




 Switch Liara and Tali and this flow chart is actually possible. 




 The first song I heard after finishing DT was *Ass Back Home* by Travis McCoy. I'll always associate it with DT despite it being totally tonally different from it. 




 I hate the Aaron Paul suggestion for this same reason. He's way too old. He'll be 40 by the time the film is even announced, if ever. Because of this, any fan casting for Eddie Dean is probably not going to work out.     
Speaking of actors meeting with producers for movies, Maisie Williams met with Sam Raimi and Neil Druckmann about The Last of Us. She's 17, and the movie hasn't been greenlit. Ellie is supposed to be 14.     
The leaders of both projects are just trying to show executives and studio heads that big actors are interested in their film. Aaron Paul for Eddie and Maisie Williams for Ellie are both way too old. 




 Christopher Lee would be my pick. 




 The Room thumbnail... 




 Only female character in The Hobbit besides Galadriel. She has a dwarf-boner. 




 They have their own styles. Doesn't matter what you think of their work. Every director leaves a mark on their films. You don't like Guy Ritchie. That's fine. He has his own style, though. 




 The Bloody Mary fight in Ep 5 is so badass. 




 Literally the next one is a Game of Thrones reference. Only c**ts name their swords. 




 Make sure to meet up with her every time she messages you. One of them is a call from the Spectre Embassy. 




 *Hone Alone 




 If it already looks that good a year away from release, I've got to say I'm getting excited. 




 200 years after Shakespeare... 




 /r/nottheonion 




 As a long time AC fan, this one really hurt me. It's hardly about the French Revolution, Arno is clearly the executive notes for Ezio 2.0 and the best character, Elise, is underused and ultimately undermined by the story itself in the most insulting way possible. What the modern day story has become is too depressing to mention when thinking of the potential and the heights of what has come before. Ubi developed AC Rogue for fans and AC Unity for sales. It was developed from executive notes and not any one person's vision. What the hell happened? 




 Massive step back from MW. I'd rather that one was on PS4. 




 The menu and loading music gets quite grating after a while. It's like every time you start up the game, a wave of depression washes over you in the form of whatever the hell instrument accompanies the guitar. 




 No one; this one isn't a true 50/50. 




 But then how else would horny 10 year old me have gotten into the show? 




 Exploration in ME1 is optional, but enjoyable for some. The planets are rather barren, so you might not/probably won't enjoy it as much.    
Scale, though, is a different story. You do feel like you're exploring an entire galaxy, and it feels amazing. The exploration from ME1 is scaled back, but the atmosphere retains a feeling of being bloody massive.    
Edit - TL:DR In terms of atmospheric scale, they *feel* big; bigger than the games actually are.      
(Just saying: if you only played 3, you haven't experienced the game's full potential. Importing saves between games changes what content you see storywise.) 




 If you buy the trilogy, you download the games separately. 




 Bioware have publicly admitted that they might do it. An exec was on Neogaf asking for wishlists, and also listed his own: 1080p, 60fps, seamless experience between the games, DLC implemented into ME3 organically, higher resolution textures etc.    
[Source](http://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2014/11/07/bioware-asking-fan-feedback-mass-effect-trilogy-ps4-xbox-one-remake/) 




 Every single character arc in Season 5 comes to a tragically, dramatically ironic conclusion. It's brilliant. 




 They did provide a reliable source. 




 Iron Man 1, kind of... 




 It's also my face seven minutes into the Arrow pilot where Tommy says "In that show Lost, they were all dead...I think." Thanks for fake-spoiling the show for millions of people, CW! 




 *"Al Jazeera's a network."* 




 [The chances are higher than you'd have thought!](http://venturebeat.com/2014/11/07/bioware-mass-effect-trilogy-remake/)    
People don't realise, but they're being discreet about it likely because it's in the works. Whether they'll actually go through with it is up in the air, because I'd imagine it would be fucking expensive.    
(Edit: better link) 




 Make sure to have Extended Cut installed and over 3100 Readiness! 




 That struck me as a lazy way to make sure it didn't break co-op. 




 Best way possible? Considering what we've had before, this is hardly the best way possible. We've never been given the chance to experience the best possible modern day story. 




 It synced Freedom Cry the other day, but it hasn't yet realised that I've 100%'d it. It also believes that even though I've completed the story for AC Revelations, I've got 0% sync. It doesn't realise that I have 100% on AC2 or have even played Rogue. My multiplayer levels for Brotherhood and Revelations are only accounting for one of my PSN accounts, rather than the original levels I synced my Uplay account with - both over level 20. It's screwed.    
Bonuses won't matter when I've moved on to another game. It will have been too long when they finally fix it. You had your chance Ubi. 




 This looks hilariously uncomfortable. 




 It's only a couple of them, though. I'll get enough for Veterans and Endurance. 




 Some of the Abstergo Challenges are bugged to zero progress, when I've definitely performed these actions many times. 




 Infamous First Light - 1 day, 29 *seconds* (no hours of minutes).    
[Here's my account](http://psnprofiles.com/train_subject4565). 




 Don't forget he left Lost altogether after one episode. 




 Probably because they can't show off any good cinematography from it. It'd look pretty out of place. 




 2001 was not technically *based* on a book. Clarke and Kubrick collaborated. Clarke admits parts of the book were adapted from independent changes to their draft in the film.    
But, yeah, 2010 was absolutely based on Clarke's book. 




 There are ways to make it interesting for longer. I just think it really drags on and it doesn't need to. 




 Bishop. She's just a new character. Possibly Erudito, but it's never stated. 




 *Me and my Battle Tits.* 




 You're on /r/PS4, so... 




 Like KDramaStars and Master Herald, massive click bait sites. 




 *My name is ASAC Ellie, and you can go fuck yourself.* 




 And SR2 at the bottom. 




 *This explains...so much.* 




 So they're apologising for the shitty release by giving us free DLC?! Great save, Ubisoft. First step towards redemption. 




 This comments section is cancer. Good post, OP. 




 For me, it gets quite repetitive after an hour and a half. Even on hardcore, it's too easy if you're good at the gunplay. And [spoiler](#s "Nyreen dies?! Why? We haven't known her for very long. It's not impactful. It takes away importance from what was an intriguing character.")    
Also, Illusive Man Lite aka Generic Russian General was quite a weak villain. He plays bloody chess and makes chess metaphors. Clich, much?    
Overall, the story felt like it was thrown together to justify spending time developing concepts for an Omega level before removing it from the original story. 




 I'm not a Batman fan, but Inception is a great rewatch with mates just for the awesome action. 




 I can't watch Memento again, but The Prestige is better every time. 




 People who did hate Desmond were too outspoken. 




 On their Twitch channel, I'd think. 




 It certainly spoiled *my* first viewing of the film, but who knows how I'll react on second watch? I still love The Prestige and Inception; they're probably both top ten favourites for me. Memento is pretty solid too. Sucks how disappointed I was in this movie, but I'm glad to see others liking it. 




 In the extended patch notes, they list "UNSPENT SYNC POINTS NOTIFICATION APPEARING TOO OFTEN". We did it, guys! 




 Yet people accuse us of lying, saying there's no possible way you could have guessed.    
I think it doesn't reflect on the movie well if people who are versed in its genre can guess what the ending is going to be, 20 minutes in. 




 It's not like they're even the reason for the movie's failure. If the leak was good, buzz would have spread. 




 Anyone who's read 2010: Odyssey Two would guess this pretty quickly, because Bowman/Star-Child does the exact same thing to his wife. 




 Dude...Revelations! 




 Aside from all of the great Breaking Bad episodes and servicable GoT episodes, she directed [last season's Walking Dead finale](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNzgDgdmRK4). I feel like they've taken a ton of cues from how she handled that episode.  




 Someone should tweet this to Raimi and Druckmann. They've already met with a fan-suggested actress, so we know they're open to public opinion. 




 I know, I'm a motherfucking mastermind! 




 GUESS WHAT? YOU HAVE A NEW RIDDLE! HOLD THE MAP BUTTON TO READ IT, or just read the clue on screen after this pop-up disappears LIKE YOU'RE ACTUALLY SUPPOSED TO. 




 Mediafire might be better for *public* sharing, or Mega.co.nz 




 Now watch [**THIS**](http://youtu.be/kH0P-CA7ntE). It's meant to be viewed post-finale. 




 What was the controversy? Ralph from The Dharmalars was on Jay and Jack's 10th Anniversary Rewatch about a month or so ago, and they were reminiscing about how great Scott  amp; Steve were. If you were willing, you could share the episodes on Google Drive possibly. The other guys and I would be grateful. 




 Not very far into Unity, but the new map is a bit painful to use. What do you guys think? 




 Different? He didn't sound at all like the cowardly mess from the glyphs in Brotherhood and II. Anyone else think this is strange?    
Off topic: Wasn't John "John from IT" Standish aka The Sage a little too similar to Revelations' portrayal of Clay? 









 EDIT: Was going to put "INB4 Lost, Mass Effect and The Dark Tower" to avoid repeats.    
Remember to put "and why"! 




 This is a VERY strange question.    
When I first read it, I interpreted the beach to be on the right of them as they progressed. When I was halfway through the book the second time through, I was furious when I figured out it was the other way around.    
All of the evidence points toward the beach being on their left - to the west.    
How did you picture it? 




 For my second playthrough of Mass Effect 1, I decided to play on Hardcore on a new profile (yeah, that's pretty stupid for a relative newcomer) as a class I had never played before - Vanguard.
I f***ing hate Benezia. I have died for literally two hours in total. I did go back to an earlier save to complete the Hot Labs, which I'd bypassed, to gain a level.
Once I went down to Casual and still died, but this time because I put in less effort. I restarted my checkpoint and was reverted back to Hardcore. I ended up persevering on Hardcore and have nearly beat the bitch.
Since I never changed the difficulty on that one save, will I still get the trophy?

Plus, any tips for the final part of that boss fight for a level 18 Vanguard on Hardcore? 
























 Oh, Jak 2 had the worst checkpoint system of any game I have ever played. It's one of the hardest games out there IMO. Jak 3 is fantastic, though easy in comparison. 




 [This art](http://cdn1.gamepur.com/images/feature/the-last-of-us-2-concept-art.jpg) by a former Naughty Dog employee (which might have been from the sequel development) *might* make you change your mind. 




 This World Ain't Big Enough for the Last of Us 




 (spoiler: yes) 




 Ellie has more story left in her. Next game should be about Ellie becoming an adult. That concept art featuring [17-18 year old Ellie with a guitar](http://cdn1.gamepur.com/images/feature/the-last-of-us-2-concept-art.jpg) (Joel said he'd teach her) is amazing. She's got a long life ahead of her, being immune to the infection.     
**Edit: provided link** 




 Only on the Season Pass or Remastered. 




 It's slang. You read it properly, therefore it worked. 




 Forgot they changed the name :) 




 Also the most fun platinum I've ever had. It's extremely short, but the battle arenas are extremely fun and challenging. You have to complete every challenge for the platinum. 




 Remember to play on Hard. 




 Ewww, that was clearly an effects bugger-up. 




 Ditto here actually, except I didn't see the beginning of Season 3 (the first seven episodes) until after Season 4. 




 Woah, as a massive fan who thought he knew everything about the show, my mind was just blown to pieces. 




 Wait...is that why she and Jack boned the night before? 




 Different territories? 




 Facebook vs North Korea is the showdown the world needs. 




 Dies. Totally worth it. 




 I maintain that The Brig (3.19) is a highly underrated episode of TV and possibly one of the best of all time. 




 I loved the original and I'm definitely curious, so thanks! Probably going to hate it but at least I'll have seen it. 




 Played the games before? 




 Easily the hardest Insanity mission for me was the Collector trap. I spent hours on that. It's the second hardest video game level I've ever played. 




 It took a long, long time for me. That 1% will move along. 




 So...when Isabella, Jacob and MIB's mother, Ben's mother etc. appear to our characters, are they themselves?     
When and when aren't they themselves?    
Appearances I specifically want clarification on:    
+ Isabella - On the Black Rock (because that is her at the end of the episode, right?)   
+ The twins' birth mother    
+ Ben's mother    
+ Christian to Michael    
+ Ana Lucia when she pulls Hurley over    
+ Libby constantly haunting Michael 




 Now play Grounded difficulty :) 




 After Grounded, I first went back through chapter select to get all collectibles (never overwrite your main save!), and I've finally finished Grounded Plus today.      
I initially took 22 hours on Grounded (wasted over an hour on the bookstore trying to trigger the joke), but I only took 13 and a half on Grounded Plus. It's much easier knowing your previous methods. Still need to go through Easy++ for weapon upgrades, but only up to the suburbs for the Shorty.     
My advice: go for it. 




 Or viewers. 




 Which was the one with his seahorse, Mystery?     
"Wee-snaw!" 




 Did they really change the name in the US to Sorcerer's Stone? Why? 




 I started played TLoU just over three months after I finished Mass Effect 3 (I'd only played 2   3 at the time, once each). Gotta say I was initially disappointed. The trophy structure was bad, the story progression felt forced (having no choices) and I just wasn't that into the gameplay.     
However, after having played so many games since October 2013, I recently picked up Remastered for pretty cheap. I gave up on Survivor difficulty earlier this year because I lost interest (wasn't even very hard); so this time I jumped straight into the new Grounded mode and it's an entirely different game in that it literally feels more "Grounded" in reality. The stakes are higher because resources and ammo are so scarce. I felt an actual connection to the characters because of it. The character deaths don't seem groan worthy anymore. I'm replaying it on Grounded+ after collecting all collectibles and conversations on chapter select.     
What I'd suggest to you is to come back to it in a few months on Grounded and struggle through that. It makes the game feel so much more genuine. 




 If you're playing the PC version of AC2 or the Game of the Year edition on any platform, you already have the DLC integrated into the story. 




 You're right; nowhere close to two months. Less than 5/8ths of it.     
And, yeah, shit should work at launch. 




 20mb patch upfront and nothing since, which is pretty fantastic for those who have data caps (Unity's updates being gigabytes each and crucial for the game to function is pretty ridiculous). 




 "Nothing brewing" is a very vague sentence, though. "We have nothing to announce" is what they said about TLoUR on Beyond's Left Behind interview, when we now know they'd been working on it for the better part of a year. It's what Bioware's Aaryn Flynn said about Mass Effect Remastered right before he went on Neogaf and asked everybody for their wishlists.     
Let's keep hoping. 




 [Interstellar spoiler](/s "In hindsight, that does spoil the ending a bit.") 




 And Breaking Bad. 




 That would have been disappointing. I like the allusion to the beginning where Joel is running through the hospital carrying Ellie, alluding to him running with Sarah at the beginning. He calls both of them "baby girl" and they're all soldiers with assault rifles and flashlights, just like the one who killed Sarah. It's all so chilling and powerful and emotionally charged. 




 It must be tough for people who aren't massive zombies fans. My mates and I just got most of them automatically on local co-op, and Sacrificial Lamb took one try while we were biding time. Can't imagine getting the Dead Ops trophies, though. Arcade is boring.     
Good job on Veteran, though! I shudder thinking about it. 




 Not out in the US? I was wondering why it wasn't getting much attention. Those 1v1 fights are so good. 




 This guy gets it. The title should have been *(Spoilers) The best scene in Gone Girl* or something. It's too specific. She does something with a boxcutter and it involves the heaviest possible spoilers. Most people would believe she's hardly in the movie especially since the title is "Gone Girl". 




 Otherwise it wouldn't be called the boxcutter scene, it would be called the box scene. Exactly. 




 They must all be provided with visually attractive templates. [This video is really good](http://youtu.be/VXJiBkFgprQ). 




 They originally said "other books". 




 This might be an AC Unity situation where they kept the original pressing date in early October but delayed the game so they could patch it. The Order was supposed to be released this year, so this is actually rather likely. You know what that means: MASSIVE DAY ONE PATCH! 




 Your money would be better spent elsewhere. 




 Revelations will be impossible. Matchmaking still doesn't work, and it's even worse now no one plays on it :( 




 You may be completely right (and probably are). Nonetheless, it's a suggestive title because it points out that the scene where she uses a sharp object is a scene involving, in OP's words, the heaviest spoilers possible.    
All I ask is that you don't shower me with downvotes :) 




 It's quite suggestive if you haven't seen it. I'm not trying to argue. 




 Depends on what you're after. If you want an even story, this is not it. The weak ending cheapens the better moments of the game. AC fans, like myself, are disappointed with the story. It was not made with franchise fans in mind.     
I wouldn't recommend it. How cheap is it? 




 This article is basically a link to another. Why not post *that*? 




 Looks just like the poster for Battleship, and 30 other movies. 




 It's a contextual spoiler. Saying there's a really powerful scene that she uses a sharp object is a spoiler. 




 *It doesn't?!* 




 That movie was made to put people into depression. 




 I'm not reading the text because I haven't seen the film. Don't put that there's a boxcutter scene in the film. I'd suggest reposting without that in the title, because knowing she's dealing with sharp objects feels like a spoiler. 




 Heartwarming episode right here. 




 Photo mode was also great for surveying your surroundings during forces combat on Grounded. 




 The Last of Us was *more* cinematic at 60fps, ffs.  




 Graphics-wise? Not too much (considering it was always stunning), but get it for 60 frames-per-second, 1080p, fantastic story dlc, most multiplayer dlc and the new difficulty level. Remastered has it all, while PS3 version is just the base game and you won't get an online pass with any used copies, so possibly not even multiplayer. Gladly, Remastered doesn't require a pass. 




 Never. It didn't even redeem any of my progress in Uplay actions until after I completed the game.     
In fact, after a few weeks my entire profile was wiped and I was pushed up to level 13 (where I should have been the whole time). 




 A week, infrequent play for me. Played through 100% on good, got all good karma trophies, then played through on hard as evil, got all random evil karma trophies, finished game again. One of my easiest platinums. 




 You actually can hide it from your account, but only through using a PS3. 




 Ahhh, my first platinum. Loved this one. 




 You don't remember the Man in Black's name because he never had a name :) 




 Edge of Tomorrow takes place over three days, though. 




 Inside porno mags.     
EDIT: Well, now my comment isn't funny anymore. 




 I think I'll make the bet that Hank will die and it will motivate Hope to become the new Wasp (her mother being the first). 




 The Delicate one is magnificent. Doesn't Hurley's discman break at the end of that one? 




 Those are some pretty ambitious platinums. I'd think Shadow of Mordor would be the one least likely to drive you insane. So, SoM would be my suggestion.     
Last of Us requires you to play the great but depressing story mode more than twice and I think more than a month in consecutive days of multiplayer. GTA V requires you to get to Level 100 online. Dragon Age almost certainly requires over 100 hours of gameplay. 




 The last four episodes of Season 3 are widely regarded as the high point of the entire series. You're up to a point where you might watch only episodes 3.13 - "The Man from Tallahasse", then 3.19 - "The Brig". A character disappears between these episodes, and The Brig is mostly about what happened in between those episodes (though it does spoil a bit of the episodes in between). They're why Terry O'Quinn won the best supporting actor Emmy that year and they might convince you to get back on track where you left off. 




 I've watched all of the show, read the first book, I'm two quarters through the second, and I still don't care for the characters. It's like every sympathisable character is the underdog. Even when Danerys became the one on top in Season 3, Season 4 comes around and now it's about her actually kinda *not really* being on top of things. Her storyline goes backwards.      
Look, the dialogue, the production and the direction are all fantastic. There are characters, but there's hardly a plot. It's all subplot. Some people like that though and that's perfectly fine with me. I still miss [spoiler](#s "Ned"). 




 **What's your favourite episode of the show (excluding the two common favourites)?**    
And, don't diss my non-American spelling of favourite ;)     
     
Mine's definitely The Brig. Ties up Locke and Sawyer's deepest issues with one of the best scenes of the entire show: the death of Anthony Cooper. 




 Well, the deep trailer voice *did* say "sometimes". Oh well. 




 It'd have to be an indie title or free-to-play. You'd die pretty quickly, so fun might wear out faster for some. 




 In many regions, Disc 7 has Exodus part 3 - in the US, that's included in Disc 6's Part 2. 




 They made it out of sheer determination, obviously. 




 Advice: Watch the first three episodes in succession! 




 *Pfffffft*. Yeah? And where is it "hidden" - their wrist or something? What a terrible idea. 




 They were pretty good, but this is an awesome poster. 




 But she's not a man! 




 Third one has some pretty good parts but it was too wacky and tried to hard to be sentimental at the end. 




 With Camilla Ludddington back, hopefully? 




 Much better than any other promotional material they've released. Has anyone heard the *horrible* tagline in that 15 second teaser?     
***SOMETIMES THE BEST MAN FOR THE JOB...IS A WOMAN.*** 




 The /Filmcast! For movies fans obviously. These guys are really relatable and don't take themselves too seriously. 




 Arno and Elise have great actors, but their arcs are far too messy. 




 So you planned on the ally trophies from the start? God, I've completed it on Insanity without any ally trophies. I can't imagine playing the game 3 more fucking times ;) 




 So, nothing to address the ridiculous amount of bugs in Remastered single player? Hunters jumping through boarded up or closed windows, psychic and instantly materialising runners, Henry not moving at all when he's supposed to help you, prompts not appearing, prompts appearing and not activating etc.     
EDIT: Friendly AI walking in front of you straight away at the beginning of a bloater fight when you should be lining up a quick shot (Bill, you prick), friendly AI running in circles, friendly AI phasing through you (I told you Ellie, you're not actually Ellen Page), hunters never noticing friendly AI when they run into them and against them, clickers not noticing friendly AI when they push into them (Bill, you're still a prick), hunters *not* noticing you when you choke out the person right next to them etc. 




 I got platinum for 2  amp; 3, but, 1? Yeah that's way too much time. Insanity was enough for me.     
Good job persisting! What was your process? 




 80s action movies in general then :) 




 No shame in plugging :) 




 Gladly. 




 And the horses chase, kind of. 




 But it's an extra gold trophy. I want it :) There are so many parts to bypass, but some of them force you into combat. It's cruel. 




 Both: my first platinum - Mass Effect 2. Because having my ass handed to me on Insanity and eventually overcoming all of my weaknesses was one of the greatest gaming experiences I've ever had. 




 I'm playing Grounded, and man it's soooo cheap. Starting the generator in the hotel: no matter what you do, a runner immediately comes up behind you if you haven't grabbed the keycard. You need to have full health to survive that at all.    
Not to mention that all infected are psychic and that you will, thousands of times, watch a stealth-killed hunter drop a loaded weapon and you'll have no way to use their ammo because their gun vanishes into thin air. Fuck Grounded.     
I can't imagine the patience the platinum takes. 




 How far in did you get? 




 Starts out painfully average, then BOOM: Fitz/Simmons feels. 




 Close. From what I've gathered, Marvel Studios' new Netflix shows will definitely be set in this universe (there's no evidence to the contrary, so there won't be a source to confirm it); though I highly doubt they'll impact anything else, so you're sort of right. 




 "The Brig", "The Man Behind the Curtain", "Greatest Hits" and "Through the Looking Glass" are the last four episodes of Season 3, and all pretty much A+. Best succession of episodes in any TV show in my opinion. Breaking Bad S4's final four are fantastic as well. 




 He provided his voice to the E3 trailer, so the immortal Sullivan will undoubtedly be back. 




 The Living Daylights is crucial for anyone who loves the Uncharted games. 




 The end of Season 3 (the last four or so episodes in succession) is up there as some of the best television ever made. Easily the best use of flashbacks in the entire series. 




 For anyone who doesn't get it, Credit Where Credit is Due plays when the first "Starring" *credits* begin showing along the bottom of the screen. 
























 His alcoholism did not save them, his skills and experience did. 




 Just from seeing clips and interviews on TV about Men, Women   Children and its message, I want to throw a chair at the guy's head.  




 I only recently watched Kill List, and what was that? Very confusing ending that leaves you disturbed and scrambling for answers.    
(Btw Filth is based on a novel by the same author as Trainspotting and is not directed by Danny Boyle.) 




 (No spoilers, don't worry) Gone Girl. The ending went on long enough to make you think that something else might happen. Made the ending feel a bit disappointing despite the film being so thrilling up to that point. 




 Like Gone Girl? 




 I usually found Filmspotting a bit scripted and occasionally a slog with all of the segues and breaks from conversation. If you're not a fan of that, I'd suggest the /Filmcast, Schmoes Know Movies Show (explicit) and Kermode and Mayo's Film Review.     
For an unconventional choice, if you don't mind some foul language, very unscripted conversations and a book club format (and the required book club dedication), The Black Dog Podcast can provide some great laughs and casual insight. Basically, you revisit/discover a movie a week and then listen to these guys recount funny events from their week, go over movie news and review the week's chosen film. One downside for *some* is that it's quite English. There are next to no reviews in the US iTunes, meanwhile the UK iTunes features hundreds of positive ratings. 




 SOMEBODY ONCE TOLD ME THE WORLD IS GONNA ROLL ME 




 *2005 




 Wow, thanks! 




 How is that even possible? :) 




 YAY! Fuck Alfred. 




 Telltale's, not Survival Instinct, right? 




 Totally. We need less "X WAS BETTER THAN Y" and more "X blew me away, what are your thoughts?" 




 The argument of this post is a running gag about the pretentious this sub can display. 




 True dat :) 




 Just a *tiny* correction, no need to be defensive. 




 Get ready for some hardcore UNUSUAL BEHAVIOUR. 




 Long Walk to Freedom was pretty much completely snubbed last year, and I've heard that's for good reason. It's about Nelson bloody Mandela and it was only nominated for Best Original Song, and I hardly believe that's would be an exception if that rule held up. 




 By all MCU Hulk films, you mean the only one? Bana's was completely separate. 




 Without a PC right now, sadly :(  




 New Zealand, too? Wow. How offensive can such an ancient game be? The OFLC are BS. I guess I can't download this one. 




 It *is* going to impact the plot of the next Avengers movie, but I guess you'll spin that back at me as still unnecessary. 









 But if they've chosen a certain look for Mandalorians, wouldn't they stick with it? You're absolutely right, but maybe they're trying to not complicate things. I dunno... 




 Indonesians and Maori literally look nothing alike. 




 Can you imagine how breathtaking Ab Aeterno would look on a big screen? Or Ben Linus' breakdown at the end of Dr Linus? Watching the master of manipulation worn down to the smallest nub of self esteem and just letting it all out, on a big goddamn screen? For free?! How is that not awesome? 




 No problem! 




 Wikipedia. If there isn't a release date there, there isn't one anywhere. 




 No. If it's scheduled for this week, you'd know. 




 No problem! That battle, though, would look amazing in IMAX. Pretty sure there's only one IMAX theatre in all of New Zealand, and it's a 6-7 hour drive away, so even if it wasn't only in the US (anyone would bet on that) I'd be screwed either way :(     
I hope anyone who has a chance to see this takes advantage of it because it sounds spectacular. 




 It's a general discussion point. 




 I've been saying for a long time that a DeGroots/Hanso Lost spin-off would be the perfect way to remedy the saltiness of the reactions to Season 6. Period piece, conspiracy-themed, pretty different genre. Alvar Hanso funds a project to find where his ancestor's lost slave ship ended up, something something DHARMA. Awesome. Doesn't even have to be advertised as a Lost spin-off. 




 More specifically, *The Watchers on the Wall* and *The Children* (S4 Episodes 9   10), as well as an exclusive Season 5 trailer. 




 They're YouTubers now. KindaFunnyGames is one of their channels, not a game dev studio. 




 I'd laugh my ass off if he appears on the cover of one he isn't in while he's currently dead. 




 Make sure Optimal is unticked if you're using Alien Blue. 




 I've play 3 and a half hours into the game and Daxter, during gameplay, still sounds gross. I've bought new expensive headphones and have listened successfully to high quality music through it and they're fine in those situations. In cutscenes, it's perfect but trust me: he sounds *nowhere near* as good as in Jak II, during gameplay. The sound effects being slightly less clear than previous games is honestly bearable, but in some cases it's just embarrassing. Framerate is great in some areas but in, for example, the Wastelander village, a hub world you often need to pass through, it's always nauseating. 




 You're probably right. It was always a show that garnered discussion, and since so many people got salty at the last season, it doesn't exactly encourage memes. 




 I consider Hearts and Minds a sort-of bottle episode. Boone character development doesn't affect the rest of the show and you'd already assumed he'd just given up on being a dick. And halfway through typing this, I realise it's the secondary introduction of the bloody hatch. Shit, you're right. 




 Take their advice, but use Adblock! 




 Breaking Bad was definitely great and all, but it was nowhere near as expansive. I could tell you everything about both shows and their characters' backstories, and I'd wager Breaking Bad would take up less than an eighth of the time. The world of Lost is much more vast. 




 /r/lost is pretty much still a discussion sub. Half the posts are one of "I'm about to start watching/I've just started season x/just finished and the ending wasn't bad at all", and the rest are mostly polls, memes, "I met this actor" and debates. For such an apparently polarising show, the sub is extremely friendly, accepting of opinions, and very much still active. 




 Really good ones, I swear 




 Therefore they listed it. 




 She looks like an older Mathilda from Leon: The Professional. A bit Natalie Portman. 




 It'd be easier to say when it's not terrible. These games could have been at least 30fps on Vita if more money and time were put into this port, because they ran at 60 on PS2. 




 I had just gotten out of the arena and in my headphones, Daxter sounded like I was listening to him through a telephone. Maybe it was my headphones and maybe it isn't as noticeable through the speakers. 




 THE AUDIO QUALITY? REALLY? In cutscenes it's fine, but in gameplay it is all kinds of ugly. Extremely disappointing.     
Don't get me started on the resolution...    
The first two games, though they had framerate problems, didn't suffer nearly as many downgrades as this one. Just...gross. 




 I was sure the Vita version only showed 2 and 3 on the cover. I'd swear. 




 As the question has been answered already, I'd highly suggest if you haven't seen it, to look up "lost 6x13 promo" on YouTube. Easily the coolest one they did, using a remix of a Gene Wilder/Willy Wonka quote. 




 It *is* too good to be true, sorry. Don't trust anything KDramaStars say. They twist quotes and hints and turn them into click bait titles. Look for reputable websites reporting the same to confirm it. 




 Wait, are the lesbians horse fans or are they lesbian horses? 




 Wizard and Glass. Only book to ever make me teary-eyed. 




 I'd bet on both my previous accounts starting off with Arrividerci Abstergo, from ACII, considering AC1 doesn't have trophies. On my current account, the first one was Fuel Efficent from Black Ops II. When creating a new account to replace my banned one, I was really into Zombies (hence "Richtofen"). 




 They could call them Miichievements...I'm sorry. 




 You select your language upon loading the discs, don't you? 




 Hold circle/B (depending on console) to skip the credits. 




 Does anyone remember the meme his character spawned?    
***BECAUSE I WAS LOADED, OKAY?!*** 




 Jak 1's framerate is pretty bad for the first hour or so, before you change hub worlds. It gets more bearable from then on. There are issues but I completed the majority of the game today (NZ timezone) and platinumed it just now. It's certainly playable, and a fantastic game. It just starts off far too jerky and nauseating. Gets way better.     
Will begin Jak II Vita tomorrow. Hope it's the same story. 




 *"Hit me, Jesus, one more time!"* 




 Brotherhood would have been my first platinum without the terrible multiplayer trophies. I actually got all of the Revelations mp trophies quite easily...on my banned account, and now no one plays that game with its terrible matchmaking. *sigh* 




 The one multiplayer-only trophy didn't take long either and counted towards the strength of your war assets in SP. Pretty satisfying. 




 No, because Alien Blue was set to load only 200 comments. 




 Nooooooo! Please tell me you have a save from before the suicide mission! 




 Either way, it's respect for the dead. Basic common tact, you know? 




 Same as the other guy. Pm would be stellar. 




 Shameless plug! I'll make sure to check you guys out. 




 (Off topic)     
To be honest, I (OP) mainly listen to long, funny movie podcasts - usually ranging from 1hr 40 to 3hr 30. Most of them only have a listener base of many hundred to several thousand. Pretty sure that turns most people off, so I can't be sure I can recommend any of them :) 




 Like Need for Speed or Stealth Inc. Nothing with an engaging story, but something with good gameplay that you can play almost mindlessly (I, for some reason, include puzzle games in that). 




 Don't be so cynical. I actually was one of the people who followed that big podcasting craze of people who analysed the show. I was hardly directly involved, but it *was* nice to follow.     
I would absolutely agree with you that there were *sooooooo* many people that went way over the top with their theories, but I never invested my time in developing those. I observed; and when the ending came, I was one of millions of fans who were satisfied with the ending.     
If you don't try too hard to make it something it's not, which both you and I have agreed that it really isn't as deep of a sci-fi thing as the 2009 fan base wanted it to be, then you'll enjoy the show for what it *actually* excels at - being 2005 Six Degrees of Separation Simulator. 




 You start. 




 No, definitely do get them chronologically. The first game is very easy to get through. I know the entire game like the back of my hand, and it's not that hard to get to that point.      
Just remember to wait through the main menu without touching anything for about 15-30 seconds so that you see the one cutscene that sets up the entire game. 




 Literally the exact same boat as you. Only difference is the country ;) 




 Hell yes, it was. It's criminal that people never talk about the show almost entirely revolving around building and utilising characters, having several seasons in which every episode features character flashbacks that are exclusively thematically related. It's always "*this mystery that was clearly answered wasn't answered*".     
The show is seriously not about that. It's about how that batshit crazy, awesome nonsense feeds the characters and their reactions/interactions. That's how the show should be watched. 




 Well, pretty much! 




 Not to mention you can usually shut them up within three answers. 




 100% confidence? Really? 




 I AM A GOLDEN GOD! 




 Okay. When I was growing up, the title card always said Thomas the Tank Engine. I think I have flicked past to see it's now Thomas   Friends. 




 Thomas the *Train*? Is this an American thing, because *tank engine* isn't as marketable? 




 I think the problem is that the game wasted too much time on some extremely pointless assassinations. That time could have been spent with the other characters. Bellec's death is spoiled in the game's own outfit menu, you acquiring the Sword of Eden is spoiled in the weapon menu etc. It's like don't even care. They've put so much effort into making the cutscenes and world look magnificent that they're missing out on making them *feel* magnificent. 




 I love you, penne. 




 Both were rather sloppy, but I feel bad for being such a dick about AC3 when Unity was far sloppier. 




 I never noticed! That's hilarious. Also, [**relevant**](http://youtu.be/X5hrUGFhsXo) 




 They only announced it for PC because they accidentally put the Uplay achievements up for the PC version. XB1 and PS4 may have been next. 




 Elise dying was just the worst possible thing that could have happened. It really does make me speechless. Like, why did that have to happen? Why? What kind of arc does that close off? It's just so illogical and totally unsatisfying and lame and angering.     
We hardly knew her. She was a new character that we were being introduced to, and they gave her a selfish death. Why wasn't she the main character, and why didn't Arno make the stupid fucking mistake of charging at a dude with a PoE? Switching the two characters around for the entire game would have made it the best ending ever. Ezio-lite was the product of focus testing, not strong ideas. He should have been blasted.     
This game makes me guilty for railing against AC3. In retrospect, *that* was far better than it could have been, i.e. this. 




 Plus it's a silver trophy iirc. Makes the game feel more completed. 




 Because the one thing that should be a side effect of anti-depressants is suicidal thoughts...wtf? 




 The Last of Us Remastered is in 60fps and feels *more* cinematic than it previously was. 




 As soon as he gets liposuction, that movie takes a massive turn towards drama. Gladly, because the movie was actually kinda lame before that. 




 Got the lead in a Wanted match in the last ten seconds and received that trophy, on my banned PSN account three years ago. Fuck even attempting to play it on my new account. 




 Just like for The Orange Box, dat shit ain't happening. Sorry :) 




 Are you playing Mirror's Edge without guns? Definitely try doing that for your first playthrough. You do have to shoot a sniper shot towards an object as part of the plot, but it's a great challenge. You'll want to play again on hard for a gold trophy. 




 In one week limited release? 




 True. Someone at her current age, in three years, should be cast. With her history, a younger actress would be strange. 




 Johansson, Hemsworth, Evans and Smulders are all 30-33. Is that really pushing 40? 




 This just in: a Nolan is filming something dark and subversive.     
In all seriousness, this looks great. 




 asasins' cred relavations is mi favrite assasin's creeed gaem  




 She's such a badass on SHIELD. Hottest 50 year old out there. 




 While you can also make him bright purple. Nice to give us the option, but it makes zero sense. 




 Starring Ewan MacGregor and Ming-na Wen. 




 Even stranger since they made it easier in Infamous 2 by giving you the ability to sense where the closest one is from any point on the map.
