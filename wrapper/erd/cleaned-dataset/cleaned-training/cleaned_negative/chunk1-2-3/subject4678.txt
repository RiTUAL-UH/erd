 [A Touch of Cloth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Touch_of_Cloth), biting satire of British procedurals (and American). It was created by Charlie Brooker who worked with Chris Morris on Nathan Barley. Chris Morris played Denholm Reynholm from IT Crowd. I could go on, but I have to poo.

 I loved the first episode, but this one blew me away. You're right: waaaaay too many moments. [I like Ilsa's ability to take people out with bubblegum.](http://i.imgur.com/XrNkwGH.gifv)

 Holy hell how many Mr Show gifs do you have?  
*weeps in shadow of salisburymistake's gif grandeur*

 As others have stated, there are too many to list. This show has that great blend of cringe, surrealism, and absurdity which is very hard to do well.
