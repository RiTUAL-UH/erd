 thank you very much for your "2 cents". :) 
  




 Hello everybody :) 

This topic really keeps playing on my mind right now, but I didn't really wanted to post this question on facebook to get some answers. So I thought, why not ask my infp fellows here on reddit? It's the best place on earth!

Now sarcasm seems to be something where opinions tremendously differ on: 
For some, sarcasm is extremly hurtful and with always a bad intention, an expression of verbally sadistic, narcisstic people (now don't get me wrong, this is definitely not my opinion). 
For others, it's a way of communication, with which the sarcastic person is playing down his/her emotions verbally (to the outside), but still kind of hurt inside. By being sarcastic and playing down the feelings, the person is trying to kind of protect himself/herself from negative reactions.(Can you see this as an introverts trait?)
But for some it just seems to be a humorous style with no bad intentions, or even an awesome kind of humor! 

Please tell me what **you** think of it! :) Maybe you have a totally different opinion on sarcasm! I'm extremely curious to hear. :) 

(I apologise in advance for any mistakes! Unfortunately, English is not my native language.) 




 Sounds awesome! I'm glad for you. :) 




 This helps me, too. :) Also, darkening the room and lots of fresh air! 
























 Oh I know exactly what you mean!
Some people do that to me sometimes, too. "Acting above me" as you described it. I actually think that's quite disrespectful to treat someones feelings this way, since they are what they are and there's always a reason why they are there. They are part of who you are and I think, no one should laugh at you. I also think, that this is not a good way to make somebody trust you. (Don't know if that makes sense outside of my head.)

When you play along, do you sometimes also think, that people think you're kind of stupid or silly things like that? 

There's no need to be sorry. :) Everything's fine. 




 Yes, I also think it should be used a little bit cautiously. :) 




 Thank you so much for sharing your opinion!
I agree that it takes not that much to be plain sarcastic, but more to put sarcasm sophisticatedly to use.
Overall I still think, "plain sarcasm" shouldn't be taken too seriously, when it's not used in a harming way. 




 Interesting thoughts! Thank you very much for sharing and complementing on my English. :) 
























 Oh I'm definitely going to watch this movie. Thank you so much for sharing! 




 I spent a lot of time thinking about how to lable/describe myself, or where I fit/could fit. I'm 21 now (so still pretty young) and I always hated it when someone asked me "Who are you?",  because I didn't have an answer! Do you already need to know, when you're still so young? Is it really that necessary to now know where your place in this society is? Doesn't that come with time, patience and experience? And does someone really want you to describe yourself in one sentence, since you're so much more than just one quick answer?


Once I started thinking about this society with its values and morals, about people describing themselves with their job, about how everyone expects you to fit into this society, because otherwise you would not be a part of it, **that's** where I stopped trying to fit into something:

We are **not** just a sentence or just a part of a category, or simply our job. We have a story, we are what we feel, we are our actions, we are what we like and what we dislike and **so**  ridiculously much more! 
I don't strongly refuse to fit, it's (to me) simply not possible, since we humans can be so complex and so much more versatile. As you said it, we would limit ourselves down to a category and that would be a waste of a humans potential. 


To me, you are definitely not crazy and first and foremost definitely not alone! I'm sending you lots of love, patience and hugs and I really hope you'll find yourself some day! 3


PS: I am still figuring out who I am and I am pretty sure, that this is going to be a long process. I'm just sharing some of my thoughts in the hope that someone could find them somehow useful, in which way ever. 




 I think same can go for arrogance. Now I'm not a psychologist, but I'm still pretty sure that behind that arrogant mask, an insecurity is hidden. 




 this is a cool idea! Would be interesting to see how the communication between only introverts goes.
