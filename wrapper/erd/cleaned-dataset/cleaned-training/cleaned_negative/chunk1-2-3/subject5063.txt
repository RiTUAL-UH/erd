 I'm a contractor. I can lie about being sick anytime and not get paid for it.  




 And a butt!  




 Your mom doesn't call because she knows you touch yourself.  




 Excellent!  I have 37 new bond ideas the Austin taxpayer will happily pay for before they have any idea what it actually does.  




 It started with his love of bracelets.  Then he built a career around it.  




 I think you've had enough carbs for today. Don't you?  




 At Walgreens I found Phillips Colon Health with a 1.5 billion cell blend of L Gasseri KS-13, bifodobacterium bifidum G9-1 and bifodobacterium longum  MM-2. 

Does that sound sufficient?  




 Wow.  You'd better have a little talk with your manager and find out where all that electricity comes from that you plug your little computer into.  (Lots of it is coal.)  Also, that chair you're sitting in isn't manufactured by wind energy.  Those lights above you?  I have some bad news about the manufacturing process.

You want the technology but don't want to think about where all the energy required to produce it originates from.  But sometimes symbolism is WAY better than actual substance. 




 What dollar amount would that require of me for an upfront investment to become partially liberated from the grid? 




 Perhaps you have vested interests in the technology industry. 

Is that why they'd have to pay your trinkets made off the back of the planet from your cold dead hands?  




 Damn! That was awesome!

 If the kid is retarded enough not to actually spell out the entire name of the game, he deserved it. 




 Nope. Because I wouldn't be preaching that a byproduct is what makes an industry evil as you might say. Do you feel guilty for having a phone?  




 People used to make a great living and entertain themselves without any of the stuff you mentioned. Actually, some still do. You just choose to use modern technologies for your own comfort it sounds to me. You choose not to do without.


I'd be willing to bet that you're even involved in an industry that not only utilizes said carbon unfriendly ends but that perpetuates the usage of them. Basically, it seems you're willing to use up the earth's resources for your own devices but at a slightly slower rate.


So sad. So hypocritical. 




 Man.  People used to exist just fine without computers.  Apparently you crave modern convenience without all the consequences. 

Don't tell me you have a phone too...  




 Yeah, but do realize how much petroleum those individual commuter parts take to manufacture? I would just give up your computer.  




 Never has the thought, "Need help?  Find a mosque!" ever crossed my mind.  




 Ooooooh man, computer huh? 

http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2009/06/embodied-energy-of-digital-technology.html 




 Sure! As long as you don't actually make use of any of those terrible petroleum byproducts in your daily life.  




 I just assumed you walk everywhere. What's more important? Saving the Earth or saving yourself some struggle by using petroleum based transportation? 

That way you can still preach to those that do and be in the clear.  




 How do you get around?  




 Gosh! You're saying that not everyone has done that yet?  Evil evil.  




 Maybe that's because right now it doesn't pay for itself.  




 Yeah. Groups of people are just inherently evil because of their position on the planet!  




 I look forward to seeing your 20 new news channels dedicated to all of the world's iniquities.  




 /s

I was being facetious in my comment.  




 Well good. Hopefully you're not so hypocritical as to ride in or drive a car at any time or wear or use items made with petroleum byproducts.  




 Oh no. I do. I also don't admonish people for doing the same.  




 Which has had more world impact?   Prrrrrrrobably Syria.  By about a mile or so.  




 Solar powered jets!  




 Number 13 will make you shit your toilet / Jew hiding place.  




 Apparently not enough for capitalists to smell money in them yet and hence the non payoff.  




 Bigger ongoing stories. Pretty simple really.  




 I guess we should dedicate an entire channel to wronged people in third world shit holes. It would probably require 10 channels going  24 hours a day.  




 If you're not against being surveiled you're for it. I assume you are standing on a street corner with a protest sign every day.  




 Eh, it happens hundreds of times every single day in those countries.    The US would only be condemning acts if that were true.  




 "We" is right. I assume you support your local oil fracker or have come up with a sustainable alternative energy.  




 Finger right on the pulse.

 At the beginning of this month I re-signed a new, 10-month lease with my apartment complex.  I had been having my lease paid with an auto-deduct from my bank account previously and had been out of town from 6/27-7/7 while another apt resident came by to walk and take care of my dog every day.  Today I was gone all day and left my door unlocked since I'd misplaced my key in my luggage.  When I got home the door was locked and I had to pay a locksmith $150.  There was a notice to vacate for non-payment of rent, utilities, etc. charging me with unpaid rent plus $160 in late fees.  I guess that by re-signing the auto-deduct was not in effect but I didn't know that.  The dog walker said there were no notices from the apt complex on the door while I was gone and I did not receive any phone calls from them about my missing rent.  I even went into the office to temporarily borrow a mail key and a guy working there said nothing to me about anything.  I have not discussed anything with the apt complex yet and have never been late on rent before.  The notice dated today 7/9 states that I have to be out on 7/12.  PLEASE HELP! 
































































































































































































































 Holy shit that's disturbing.  




 Voiced by Stephen Colbert.  




 But can I do it in 5 days?  




 Fuck cords. Bluetooth is where it's at.  




 What's even more disgusting is that you know that the lender shaved his pubes with it too and now they're pube buddies.  









 Actually 13 grams of fiber plus 6 grams of Erythritol (what I assume is a sugar alcohol) So 25-19=6 grams of carbs per bar. 1 being sugar.  



















 Thanks! 10 years experience running quality title and now I'm going to have to look outside of the industry I love until things start moving again.

 No. He thinks that the woman who viciously attacked him on the street was sub-human scum. And she is!

 Horrific! I'm going to ask my doctor for that pill tomorrow.  




 Any particular reason? Are sugar alcohols bad? Regular protein bars taste like crap. 




 Are [these](http://www.atkins.com/products) acceptable to eat as treats when I get sugar cravings and am cutting while still working out?  It seems like they provide lots of protein while only having net 3 grams or so of carbs.  Has anyone had any experience with these or sworn off them for any reason?  Would you highly recommend against them?

 I've heard lots of arguments, pro and con, and it seems like people sometimes advocate this out of spite that someone else got their money unjustly. I want to know the actual hows and whys of putting actual money in my pocket enabling me, as a middle class person, to get richer.  




 Huh, interesting. I'm not sure that the mirror image thing is necessary but the heads up thing is cool. I've learned to listen to TV more than watch. You just have to have a familiarity with the general settings and characters.

 I have no problem with bench because it involves pushing straight out without bending at the wrist. Bent wrist push-ups are another story.  




 Exactly. No more bending at the wrist and applying pressure but you can push out straight like a bench press easily. Guess that would mean handstands on your fists?

Tell me, are Republicans not going to investigate the what they believe are the fudging of the numbers from NASA? If not show me where that is proven false. Whether or not NASA has done so or not is beside the point. The Republicans ARE in fact going to investigate those claims. And this sure as Hell relates to global warming.

 Specist.  




 So I interviewed for a sales job I really want and they wanted me to go meet with four of their sales people. I thought the interview went great. After meeting with them they all had high praise for the company making me want to work there all the more. The sales people I talked to said that I needed to keep following up and that the mgrs I interviewed with would assume that anyone that didn't follow up didn't really want the job. I mailed two hand-written thank you notes two days after the interview and sent email follow-ups after each two sales people I met with. The problem is that I have since left several voicemails with no return and when I did get ahold of one of them he said he was on his way to a meeting and would call me back. (He didn't). 

Am I wrong or is this a total dick move on their part? I don't have a month to waste professing my love and chasing this company.

 It appears to be two separate lies from Williams. 

"the NBC anchor was nowhere near that aircraft or two other Chinooks flying in the formation that took fire." The report cited interviews with "crew members on the 159th Aviation Regiment's Chinook that was hit by two rockets and small arms fire." It said "Williams arrived in the area about an hour later on another helicopter after the other three had made an emergency landing."
