 i don't buy it. delusional kids are easy meals.  




 don't take investment advice from strangers seriously. best thing you could do is put it in the bank. maybe look at cars once a week  




 do you have a piece of gum? 




 i paid $600 for a vet to hook my my cat up to an I.V. overnight. the vet knew my cat was dehydrated right away but still half the bill was for running tests.  




 wishing i was caught up in a bank robbery. i would close my eyes and put my hands over my ears so there's no need for them to kill me. the robbers would be so impressed that they would give me money. 




 why do Scotsmen wear kilts?

because sheep can hear zippers 




 rock paper scissors. the trick is, after awhile people usually forget about one of the choices and if you keep track of what they do then you will beat them 




 the ability to slide on anything, regardless of gravity and friction. all i would need is a running start and i would be able to slide along the side of buildings 




 we share 99% of our DNA with apes. so apes are 1% less smart then us. so imagine the species that is 1% smarter then us. they can make whatever drug they damn well please. so far DMT is the only drug we have made purely for recreational use, and that is some intense shit. our brains would not be able to handle the drugs these advanced aliens use  




 every sailor has at least one blow up doll (most are male because they are in the navy) and when they take gun fire they deflate them and fill them with helium so they float. they then tie them to the ship and the ship is unsinkable 




 i put my dog down when he was unable to stand by himself. i tried holding him up so he could pee but he was too proud for that.  




 don't have to go back in time but i would ask emma watson to blow me 




 i got poop on my dick 




 i wouldn't remember it  




 but when it's nice out it's fucking perfect 




 i potato 




 i can't compare it to anything else. some people say it doesn't rain much but it rains hard, some people say it rains a lot but not that heavy. it just fucking rains. 




 seattle: i guess i'm normal  




 WHO THE FUCK DOWNVOTED THIS! THIS IS HILARIOUS 




 work out everyday and you will feel better instantly 




 i love you 




 looks like i'm the first one to call bullshit. if two things compete against each other for long enough, one will eventually dominate the other. men have the choice of the litter and women will have to settle- whether it be for money or security or whatever they will have to settle while we can get what we want if we work for it. fat women stand no chance at getting an alpha male and will have to settle for beta, while fat men can provide things other then looks. i'm drunk and will delete this comment tomorrow. 




 i introduced my friend to 4chan and reddit. he is failing all his classes 




 one of my balls is a lot bigger then the other. it's from riding my bicycle into a car.

edit: wait, i thought these were supposed to be 100% true 




 don't be THAT GUY. just chill and have a good time 




 why do people (i mean women) care so much about their own birthday and get so upset if it doesn't go perfectly?  




 i just wrote this in another thread. one time at a high school party i overheard a cute girl say she only came out tonight to have sex with me. i pretended not to hear because i was a shy virgin at the time. 




 google it. don't downvote because you're too retarded to believe something that seems unlikely 




 i bought my friend in the hospital a e-cig and it broke the next day. and i couldn't find the receipt/ 




 there's a type of jellyfish that never dies of old age 




 i blacked out and woke up in detox in wyoming surrounded by drunk natives and not knowing where i was. 




 that's pretty interesting about the emperor. i wonder then if nuking a non populated area really would have worked the same. 

actually over 400,000 japanese died. half vaporized, half died later from fallout and such. 




 i wish i never started smoking cigarettes. now i can't stop 




 ok, speech therapist is right.  




 thanks. what's a logoped? 




 i can't pronounce the letter R and i have a stutter. this really makes my life hell. i've almost given up making new friends and no one will hire me. 




 based on your comment history, you are going to get stabbed. enjoy death asshole 




 since you paid for him, legally he belongs to you. take this cunt's ass to small claims court and you'll definitely win. 




 when is mothers day? 




 SO YOU'RE THE ASSHOLE WHO DOESN'T TIP ME! 




 wow i can't wait. thank you, doesn't sound too crazy so i'm not so nervous anymore. 




 i'm getting some soon and just want to know what i'm in for. i've tried shrooms a few times and some super weak acid once. 

what can i expect my trip to be like? i mean what was yours like? 




 aww fuck yeah . awesome thank you. i'm getting some soon and i want to know what i'm in for. 




 shit. i meant to put "AMA request" in the title.  




 i would smoke a lot more weed 




 oh yeah i forgot about that thing. but i'm talking about on a much larger scale. like a fire extinguisher that you can use on wild animals to get them high so you can catch them.  




 now that i'm thinking about it, after i payed and picked him up they showed me how they knew he was dehydrated. something with his eyes and the skin on his neck didn't go right back into place if they pulled on it. and they still ran a buttload of tests even though they knew what was wrong. 




 the tests they ran accounted for most of the bill 




 ooh thank you 




 thanks 




 you also have my ideas. my first idea is a weed gun. it's like a fire extinguisher but it blows out weed smoke. you can get animals high so you can catch them.

my second idea is jeans with velvet on the insides.

i have more ideas but i forget them. 




 how do you find a prostitute? i want one. 




 say someone who doesn't know anyone in the tv show/movie industry writes a pilot episode or something, what does he do from there? 




 "What the fuck?" I say aloud as i frantically search my brain for clues as to how i wound up in the middle of a dense forest. As I take in the absurdity of my situation I think back on the previous day. I didn't drink and I only left the house to get a pack of cigarettes. 
"Oh fuck yeah, cigarettes." 
As i take my first drag I approach my situation with a new sense of calm. I hear running water so i make my way towards that. 
I don't remember falling asleep but that's not new. I don't think I'm dreaming but I've never been able to have a lucid dream before. 




 how did you do that? that must have taken some effort 




 i would pay a pilot to fly me around the state so i can drop bags of weed attached to parachutes 




 that's weird. you lose a lot of water when you sleep so maybe you just got dehydrated. alright then i'll quit talking to you. 




 i have insomnia 




 she self serves when we play hacky sack... and misses... again and again 




 i live in seattle... so no. it was only a drop or two.  




 jack off twice 




 i smoked my piss once. i peed out my window and jiggled my dick to get all the piss out and some of it landed in a packed bowl. my last bowl. 




 i blew a smoke ring and turned it into a heart 




 would a lesbian be aroused by her own boobs? 




 pyramid apricot ale 




 i got the big scar on my leg from fighting tigers in asia as a child warrior prince 




 yeah especially since my name is charles 




 i also want to be a stand up comedian but i stutter and can't pronounce the letter R that well. i feel for you. 




 i wish i could give you more then one upvote 




 yes 




 women aren't funny. 




 i turned on the tv right when my dad came home and there were two guys having gay sex. we watched it together.

 thank you. one more thing if you don't mind, which number in the picture in this link should the tip of my tongue almost touch? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alveolar_ridge 




 thank you very much. one more thing if you don't mind, which number in the picture on this page should the tip of my tongue nearly touch? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alveolar_ridge 




 thank you. on the picture in this link, which number should the front of my tongue go towards? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alveolar_ridge 




 i won $300 at a casino, then spent most of it at a strip club 




 i was always running away from something and my legs would feel really heavy, and i wouldn't be able to run fast enough 




 thank you. i still have some research to do but now i have a starting point 




 what's the name of waldo's evil twin? 




 so CO2 emissions cause greenhouse gasses which reflects some radiation back towards earth? and radiation is the same as light. do i have the jist of it? 




 so then why are you at the mall? 




 so the earth has always been getting warmer since it was created? what is infrared radiation? which way is the radiation ejected, back towards earth?  




 why is earth's climate getting warmer? 









 thank you 




 I KEPT SAYING "STOP" BUT SHE WOULDN'T. even when tears streamed down my face, she wouldn't just let me run away and lock myself in the bathroom. i think she craved my humiliation, she loved being stronger then me. she loved being on top and dominating me until i couldn't take it any longer and peed my pants. she just wouldn't stop tickling me 




 ross's is hardly noticeable, i sound like a cartoon character. that's a good idea though, thanks.  




 already have it memorized, that's how nervous i am. and actually if i think about what i'm going to say before i say it then i'm more likely to stutter. english is my first language, speech therapy didn't do shit 




 i was thinking about saying my nickname was "boston joe" on the first day of class, but didn't because of shyness and not knowing anything about boston 




 is it just me or does everyone with down's syndrome look like twins? 




 i say these whenever i'm home alone 




 what? that is the opposite of how i was taught. i was taught to curl my tongue backwards. i just tried your way and i can't do that either. 




 i'm 21 and i've had this problem all my life. i used to go to speech therapy for years until i just gave up (also have a stutter). it didn't do shit. 

how far back should i curl my tongue? was there anything specific that really helped you? 




 ok thank you. i'll have to go buy a mouse so i can do that. this isn't my computer i'm on 




 ok i'll try that, thanks 




 thanks. what's a driver and how do i re-install it? 




 yup 




 nope. i thought of that, not an 80 year old 




 yup. testicular trauma its called 




 THE DOCTOR SAID HE WOULDN'T TELL MY PARENTS ANYTHING WITHOUT MY PERMISSION, HE LIED. one of my balls (actually the ballsack) is a lot bigger than the other because i rode my bicycle into an oncoming car. when my mom comes back in the room. he draws my genitals on his notepad and shows my mom. he then says what size my balls are on a scale of one to ten, and then goes on to tell us what size his balls are. 




 shit. i guess i should have waited for an answer. thanks for looking this up, you went above and beyond 




 nosleep. that's it, thanks 




 that's a good idea but my friend is fishing in alaska so i don't know where to get weed 




 nothing to do with you if that's what you mean.  




 do you know the name of that thread for creepy stories? 




 ok thank you. i've never done this and i can see how this would be helpful. thanks a lot 




 hmm i'll try that, thanks. your comment might actually be helpful for a change. i like to write strange fiction but i'll give this a shot. 




 two problems with that: i only have one friend and he's kind of permafried, and i'm too self conscious for that anyways. 




 my problem is that i can't get my ideas onto paper. i can't even write for 15 minutes without getting frustrated and needing a smoke break 




 i'm too self conscious for that. maybe i'll put some of my stories on reddit. 




 the only drink i've ever ordered at a bar is manny's 




 ok thanks 




 what sorry? i think i've heard of tonic water. away to google i goooo 




 ok thanks 




 what is tonic? 




 double just means twice as much alcohol right? non clear rum means it was stored in barrels right?  




 what is that? 




 really? can is better then bottle? 




 i knew someone would say this but i didn't think it would be the very first comment 




 i hate all the women on the daily show 




 its just that i'm terrified of my parents smelling lotion on me or hearing the noise 




 i masturbate without lotion or lube or anything like that. 




 no but last week i started a new job and the day after my first day of work i dreamed that i would walk out of the store and somehow would wind up right back in it. this kept happening until a security guard came up to me and asked to talk. then out of nowhere another security guard comes up behind me and grabs my balls. i don't fight back but it hurts bad. i wake up and think this dream means that society finally has me by the balls. 
























 but i already know this... it's not fast enough tho 




 my pillow is too hard, giving me a headache 




 i'm trying to lucid dream tho so i stopped 









 well done 




 home alone - human centipede - saw   




 alright thanks. looks like i need a college education. reading books that don't cost a couple hundred bucks can only get you so far 




 that's just as cool. do you have any special qualifications that gave you an advantage over other applicants for the job? 




 i have always wanted to work at a library? how did you end up there? any special training or education? 




 because then you couldnt have this circlejerk 




 that fucking asian cunt. i would fuck her up 




 thats definitely it thank you so much my brother will love this christmas gift i'm sure. although i might have waited too long 




 asian women drivers 




 sent a picture of my balls to a friend i don't like, he stopped talking to me 




 i was at a party and this cute girl openly said she only came to fuck me. i pretended not to overhear. i'm so fucking pathetic 




 your ex-wife shoots up heroin 




 you really don't care that you could have ruined someones life? 




 you're genuinely a really awful person. you show no remorse for seducing a married man and you actually seem to be bragging about it. i hope somewhere down the line you look back and realize just what a terrible person you are.  




 thank you i'll look into that 




 the doors - lsd 




 alright thanks. GTA 4 isn't as good as those? 




 san andreas it is then, thanks. is GTA 4 not good at all? 




 would vegetable oil work? 




 does the bowl need to have steep sides? what did you use? 




 i don't think i have vinegar but thanks :) 




 good point from a good movie 




 DMT 









 i'm completely new to this... what's a torrent? 









 too bad about the fake tits, she's still beautiful though 




 commenting so i can return to this later. for science 




 commenting so i can come back to this 




 commenting so i can come back to this 









 nice try, troll. or are you just dumb enough to think that shooting another human being is the only thing guns are used for? 




 solitude. those rare moments when everyone else on my timezone is asleep and i walk through the park 




 i may not be as bad as you, i like hanging out with one friend at a time. whenever someone calls me up i make sure it's only us two kicking it. i stutter and can't pronounce the letter R, i think this is why i'm so quiet around groups of people. i only have one friend now because my other good friends got addicted to shooting up heroin and are no longer the same people i became friends with, so i ignore their calls and texts. i feel awful every time they call and i ignore it. and my other not so good friends, i finally realized only called me because they needed something like for me to drive them around. i guess i needed someone to vent to, thank you stranger 




 i was thinking about buying a fleshlight (those flashlight vagina things) and told a story about how i bought mine. i was sitting in my car on the street outside my apartment building in seattle, smoking a cigarette. it was raining and a homeless woman carrying a baby walked by and i asked her if she wanted a cigarette and get warm in my car for a minute. she accepted. her face actually lit up because i treated her like a person. we get to talking and it's obvious from her face and teeth that she does a lot of hardcore drugs. i point out where i live and offer to take care of her baby for her. she gratefully but remorsefully accepts, and i give her 40 bucks so she'll get out of my car and go buy drugs before she stinks it up. she hugs and kisses her crack-dumpster baby and cries as she walks to the food shelter. i lied to her about where i live and i just got a fleshlight, but now i'm thinking about getting one that doesn't cry and need to be fed 




 the scar on my leg i got from fighting tigers as a child prince in asia 




 i said "hi." 

then she said "hey how are you?" 

then i said "good. how are you?"

then she said "good." 




 provenance, merlot, napa valley, 2005 




 i have been so closed off and reclusive for so long that it's impossible for me to change. i want to change, but everyone i know will know that this new person is not the real me. i want to be outgoing but this would require a new surrounding with people i don't know 




 how much change does two weeks worth make? that's a lot of money for me 




 thank you for all the help. i just have a couple more questions if thats ok. for the acid, do you mean squeezing a little orange juices into the bowl? how do i get the ground up seeds out of the water, or do you mean to drink this mix?  




 what's a water soak? or is it just exactly what it sounds like? 




 what should i wash them with? alcohol? would water work? 




 you will need a backpack and stuff to put in it 




 what do you mean i'm funny? you mean the way i talk? funny how?  I mean funny like I'm a clown? I amuse you? I make you laugh, I'm here to fuckin' amuse you? What do you mean funny? Funny how? How am I funny? 




 nice try troll 




 you'll have to quit drinking alcohol for a little while too 




 what seeds did you take? how many? 




 i don't think i'm going to wash them, just grind them into a pb j sandwich. i fully expect to get sick but i'm ok with that.  




 what seeds did you use? how many? 




 what seeds did you use? how many?  




 when you jack off do you only use one finger? 









 thank you for replying, i was sure it wasn't well known enough to find anyone but i just thought i'd try my luck. did you extract the LSA from the seeds or just swallow/grind them? would you do it again? any open eye visuals? 




 wow i actually didn't think i would get this lucky! did you extract the LSA from the seeds or just swallow/grind them? what seeds did you use?
