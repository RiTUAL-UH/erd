 This question is purely theoretical for the time being; however, I am genuinely extremely curious about this: Is putting sperm directly into a man's bloodstream a guaranteed way to permanently sterilize him? As in, is this type of male sterilization incapable of ever failing for any male?

Any thoughts on this?

Also, Yes, this is certainly a completely serious question.

 OK--here is my question:

Do you think that elective orchiectomies (castrations) for sterilization purposes should be available to men in a safe, medical setting (as opposed to in a "back-alley")?

This question is not an abstract one; rather, this question is a very real and relevant question for me personally considering that I myself want to become a eunuch in large part for sterilization reasons but also, if possible (after all, I still want to get erections using my penis) for feminization purposes and to reduce my sex drive.

Now--why exactly am I asking this? Well, many pro-choicers, both on Reddit and elsewhere, have told me that they are unwilling to deal with *any* risk of an unwanted offspring being born. Thus, I see absolutely *no* reason for me to be okay with *any* risk of this occurring. However, since I myself obviously don't have the option of abortion (and would *never* rely on *any* woman's word that she will get an abortion *regardless* of whatever promises she made to me beforehand) and consider the idea of abstaining from penis-in-vagina sex with *all* fertile and potentially fertile women to be both utterly unrealistic and utterly unacceptable, there is no other acceptable choice for me in regards to achieving this goal other than castration due to the fact that *all* non-drastic contraceptives and sterilizations have a failure rate.

Also, before someone brings up the "Do no harm" principle, I would like to point out that:

1. This principle was already thrown out of the window when doctors performed many/most medically unnecessary elective surgeries.

2. Self-castration attempts and "back-alley" castration attempts are *much* more dangerous than getting castrated (as in, getting an orchiectomy) in a safe, medical setting.

3. There is *no* other way for a man to get himself sterilized in a way which *cannot ever* fail.

4. The worst effects of castration can be mitigated/dealt with the help of hormone replacement therapy.

Also, in regards to lawsuits, let me say this--first of all, as far as I know, there are waivers for doctors to significantly reduce or eliminate this risk. However, even if one ignores that, it is worth noting that, short of a massive botching of my (planned) castration (orchiectomy), I myself would consider it to be extremely immoral to sue a doctor for performing a castration (orchiectomy) on me. After all, if I will even try suing such a compassionate and caring doctor for doing this, then this doctor might become more hesitant to perform elective castrations in the future, which in turn could very well result in more self-castration attempts and in more back-alley castration attempts (both of which are (much) more dangerous) afterwards. Thus, for me, suing such a doctor for doing this is absolutely intolerable!

In addition to this, please don't lecture me about biological differences! After all, I myself have absolutely *no* intention of being a slave to biology! After all, just because biology is unequal and unfair certainly does *not* mean that we cannot and should not make it more equal and fairer.

Thus, again, my question here is this--do you think that elective orchiectomies (castrations) for sterilization purposes should be available to men in a safe, medical setting (as opposed to in a "back-alley")?

 Are there any doctors who perform orchiectomies without a therapist letter right now? If so, then is it okay to tell me their names?

 Basically, this question is pretty self-explanatory: Other than a massive screw-up on the doctor's part during a surgery, are waivers an extremely effective way for doctors to avoid getting sued by patients who change their minds about their surgeries later on?

What especially got me curious about this is this part of this article:

http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/health/no-sex-please-were-eunuchs-28469767.html

"
Before the operation he had a half-hour consultation with the surgeon about why he wanted to be castrated. At the time I didnt know why I wanted to have it done, Roger admits. I just knew I wanted it. He wanted to make sure that it was the right decision to make. I had to sign a waiver so that I couldnt sue him for any kind of negligence. He gave me all the opportunities to back out of it.
"

Frankly, as far as I know, the doctor mentioned in this article (who I think is now deceased) never got sued by any of his patients for performing elective castrations (which, for the record, I strongly applaud him for doing due to my own egalitarian views on this and due to the fact that it is better than self-castrations and "back-alley" castrations).

Anyway, any thoughts on this?

 In your opinion, how much of a role did 9/11 have in Al Gore's decision not to run for U.S. President in 2004? After all, 9/11 and its aftermath helped push the dispute over the 2000 election into the past (which might have helped Bush) and also helped Bush by giving him an anti-terrorism and anti-Axis of Evil platform to use in his 2004 re-election campaign.

 I know that this might be a pretty unimportant issue, but what if the 2006 Montenegrin independence referendum narrowly failed rather than narrowly passed (as in real life)? For the record, by "narrowly failed", I mean the pro-independence side winning, say, 54.5% of the vote and thus narrowly missing the 55.0% threshold.

Any thoughts on this? Also, it would be especially nice if someone with some knowledge of Montenegro and/or of the Balkans in general could respond to this question of mine.

 As for me, I am tempted to say that I would have created a very loose Iraqi federation with three extremely autonomous parts--a Sunni one, a Shiite one, and a Kurdish one. All of these parts get a share of the Iraqi oil revenues (based on, say, their population or whatever) as well as the right to secede (in which case they gain full control of the oil on their territory but lose their rights to the revenues from oil in other parts of Iraq). If neighboring countries have a problem with this Iraqi right to secede, then I would tell them to deal with it. Also, I would have had Iraq create a Western-style constitution which would allow democracy and free elections to occur in Iraq. In addition, I most certainly would not have disbanded the entire Iraqi Army in 2003; rather, I would have only purged the "bad apples" (as in, those with a lot of blood on their hands) at the top of this Army.  Also, before I forget, I would have also demanded that Iraq give the U.S. a part of its oil revenues in order to compensate the U.S. for its losses in Iraq.

Frankly, if my approach in regards to this would have been followed, then there might have very well been no Sunni insurgency in the 2000s in Iraq and likewise no ISIS presence in Iraq right now.

 I was wondering if anyone here who still has a penis but who already got rid of his or her testicles (for whatever reason) is able to tell me how exactly penis-in-vagina seek feels for him or her right now; specifically, does this sex feel good? As good as it was before?

The reason that I am asking this question is because I myself want to get castrated/have an orchiectomy in order to be sterilized in a way which cannot ever fail (after all, even vasectomies can fail), in order to regulate my sex drive, and in order to help feminize my body to some extent (after all, I am a gender-fluid/cross-dreaming person). However, I would still like to keep my penis indefinitely as well as to have penis-in-vagina sex.

 Was the Safavid conversion of Iran to Twelver Shia Islam an early example of a nationalistic move by a government? After all, as far as I know, the goal of this mass conversion was to help create an even more unique Persian/Iranian identity which would help Iran (then known as Persia) preserve its independence in the face of threats from the Ottoman Empire. Plus, this move made Iran an "island" of Shiism surrounded by a sea of Sunnism.

Frankly, to me, if one replaces the religious aspect with the ethnic aspect, this Safavid policy appears to be very similar to some of the policies of European nationalists in the 19th century and beyond; after all, as far as I know, some/many European nationalists in the 19th century and beyond (such as those in France) pursued policies such as teaching everyone the same dialect of their official national language in order to create and foster a greater sense of national unity and cohesiveness in their countries.

 What if Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi would have tried pursuing a rapprochement with the West in the early 2000s (such as by renouncing terrorism, paying compensation for Lockerbie, et cetera) but refused to give up his WMDs and nuclear weapons program? In this scenario, would NATO have still intervened in Libya during the Arab Spring in order to help overthrow Gaddafi?

 This might be extremely unlikely, but here goes:

What if the U.S. had given Saddam Hussein a crystal-clear and stern warning that the U.S. will intervene if he will invade Kuwait and Saddam Hussein thus decided to invade Syria instead due to the fact that, while Syria doesn't have much oil, conquering Sunni-majority Syria might allow Saddam and his Sunni supporters to further consolidate their power in Iraq. Plus, Saddam might come to believe that a rematch between Iraq and Iran is inevitable; thus, he would like to pursue regime change in Syria in order to overthrow the Iranian-allied Assad regime there and in order to eliminate the possibility of a two-front war (for Iraq--after all, Iran is on the eastern side of Iraq while Syria is on the western side of Iraq) in the future.

How exactly will an Iraqi invasion of Syria in the early 1990s (say, sometime between 1990 and 1995) turn out? Also, would there have been a significant difference in the outcome of this war if this Iraqi invasion of Syria would have occurred before as opposed to after the collapse of the Soviet Union?

 This joke is in the form of a story; anyway:

-Bob goes to Mary and Richard's house (for the record, Mary and Richard are boyfriend and girlfriend).

-Mary opens the door wearing nothing but a towel.

-Bob tells Mary: "I'll give you $500 if you will show me what exactly is covered by your towel!"

-Mary thinks about this and then temporarily removes her towel, thus showing Bob her naked body.

-Bob then gives Mary the $500, and Mary closes the door afterwards. Afterwards, Bob goes back to his house.

-With the $500 in her hands, Mary goes upstairs, where Richard currently is.

-Richard asks Mary: "Who exactly was at the door?"

-Mary replies: "Oh, it was just our creepy neighbor Bob."

-In response, Richard asks: "Did Bob ever tell you anything about the $500 that he owes me?"

 OK--basically I myself am a gender-fluid person who identifies more as male than as female; however, the idea of feeling female extremely strongly appeals to me. While I am capable of sometimes living as a (trans-)woman, I suspect that it would be very hard for me to do this all of the time; however, the idea of living as a (trans-)woman full-time would extremely strongly appeal to me if there was much less transphobia than there currently is. (For the record, I do strongly want to feminize my body, but I would still prefer to live as a male most (but certainly not all) of the time unless (God forbid) "my hand is forced" in regards to this.)

Thus, my question here is this--when exactly, if ever, do you think that we will be able to successfully change people's gender identity (on a completely voluntary basis, obviously)?

Also, to clarify--I myself certainly don't care whether or not other people would utilize such technology if it is ever developed; rather, my primary interest in such technology is personal.

 Here is my question--once we will be able to alter people's brains*, how exactly will we regulate this technology?

Any thoughts on this?

*In regards to this, I am talking about both getting rid of undesirable things, such as a sexual attraction to prepubescent children and a propensity to commit crime, as well as talking about more casual uses of such technology, such as changing one's sexuality (such as from straight to gay) and/or gender identity.

 Would such a move on Obama's part significantly backfire? Or would no one really care about such a move?

And Yes, this is a silly scenario, but it is purely hypothetical and I am genuinely extremely curious about this.

Anyway, does anyone have any thoughts on this?

 As you hopefully know, when Britain withdrew from Palestine in 1948, Palestine was (supposed to be) partitioned between the Jews and the Arabs. Likewise, when Britain withdrew from India in 1947, India was partitioned between the Hindus and the Muslims so that each of these religious groups would have a state which they would solidly dominate (of course, the Muslims in British India appear to have wanted this much more (and for obvious reasons) than the Hindus in British India did).

Anyway, what I am asking here is if there could have been any other realistic cases where European powers partitioned their colonies into two or more separate countries (in order to create separate countries for various ethnic and/or religious groups) before they (the Europeans) withdrew from these colonies and gave these colonies independence. If so, then exactly which other former European colonies could have been partitioned in this way shortly before they acquired independence?

Any thoughts in regards to this?

 OK--basically I myself am a gender-fluid person who identifies more as male than as female; however, *the idea of* feeling female *extremely* strongly appeals to me. While I am capable of sometimes living as a (trans-)woman, I suspect that it would be very hard for me to do this all of the time; however, *the idea of* living as a (trans-)woman full-time would *extremely* strongly appeal to me if there was much less transphobia than there currently is. (For the record, I *do* strongly want to feminize my body, but I would still prefer to live as a male most (but certainly *not* all) of the time unless (God forbid) "my hand is forced" in regards to this.)

Thus, my question here is this--when exactly, if ever, do you think that we will be able to successfully change people's gender identity (on a *completely* voluntary basis, obviously)?

Also, to clarify--I myself certainly *don't* care whether or not other people would utilize such technology if it is ever developed; rather, my primary interest in such technology is personal.

 My question is this--would Hillary Clinton be running for U.S. President in 2016 if U.S. President Barack Obama would not have picked her as his Secretary of State (which in turn would have caused her to remain in the U.S. Senate) and if Obama would have picked a younger and less gaffe-prone VP such as Evan Bayh or Tim Kaine?

 In regards to this contraceptive testosterone gel:

http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/03/block-that-sperm/384971/

"A testosterone gel: The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development is nearing a second round of clinical trials of a hormonal gel that men are directed to rub daily on their shoulders (a place thats not too hairy and not too sweaty, the NICHDs Diana Blithe told me). The gel contains Nestorone, a synthetic progestin that, by inhibiting testosterone production, stops the testicles from making sperm. The drug would also deliver testosterone to the blood, in an effort to prevent any change in libido, ejaculation, or muscle mass. Blithe says she hopes the gel will make for an appealing alternative to vasectomies and condoms."

I've got a question--other than the fact that it is presumably temporary and presumably capable of failure, how exactly, if at all, is this contraceptive testosterone gel *meaningfully* different from physical/surgical castration plus testosterone replacement therapy? Maybe I am totally missing something here, but the only *meaningful* differences between these two things which I see are the fact that this gel is presumably reversible and the fact that this gel is presumably capable of failure.

Any thoughts on this? Is my analysis of this spot-on, or am I completely missing something here?

Also, Yes, this is certainly a completely serious question. :) Also, I am certainly *not* trying to provoke anyone here; rather, I am simply trying to learn more information myself. :) 




 Let's have Al Gore officially win in 2000 by winning Florida by several hundred or several thousand votes as a result of George W. Bush saying a(n additional) stupid remark shortly before the 2000 election.

In this scenario, what exactly does U.S. foreign policy look like from 2001 to the present-day?

As for my own thoughts on this, here you go:

Al Gore (U.S. President between 2001 and 2009):

-9/11 still occurs due to the fact that, as far as I know, at least some of the issues (such as various U.S. intelligence agencies failing to sufficiently work with each other) which failed to prevent 9/11 would have still existed in this scenario.

-After 9/11, Gore would have still invaded Afghanistan due to the Taliban refusing to accept all of the conditions in his post-9/11 ultimatum to them. After helping the Northern Alliance overthrow the Taliban, the U.S. would have successfully killed Osama Bin Laden. However, after Bin Laden's death, Al-Qaeda would still continue to exist and to function with new leadership (but would gradually become weakened over time). Hamid Karzai is still installed as the new President of Afghanistan in this scenario, and while there is much more of a U.S. and Western focus on Afghanistan in this scenario, a lot of the issues which affected the Western war effort in Afghanistan in real life would have still been present in this scenario. Thus, I suspect that the U.S. will eventually lose its patience in Afghanistan in this scenario (and earlier than in real life) and thus eventually push for the creation of a Northern Alliance-"reformed" Taliban unity government in Afghanistan with a small long-lasting Western troop presence in Afghanistan in order to help keep the peace there. Whether the U.S. and the West (as in, the other NATO countries) will succeed in regards to doing this is anybody's guess.

-Gore does *not* invade Iraq due to the fact that he does *not* have a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein like Bush Jr. did. Rather, Gore exploits the aftermath of 9/11 to fully restore the sanctions regime on Iraq and to keep a close eye on Saddam Hussein.

-Gore successfully pursues a rapprochement with Iran due to their mutual hostility to the Taliban, al-Qaeda, and Saddam Hussein. Gore views a U.S. rapprochement with Iran as a useful tool to help stabilize Afghanistan and to put additional pressure on Saddam Hussein.

-Without an Iraq War, Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi takes longer to pursue a rapprochement with the West. However, 9/11 helps gradually push Gaddafi and the West closer together, which in turn results in Gaddafi fully renouncing terrorism and giving up all of his WMDs and his nuclear weapons program sometime in Gore's second term (2005-2009).

-There are more U.S.-Israel tensions in the early 2000s than there was in real life due to the fact that Gore, unlike Bush, doesn't fully support *all* of the anti-terrorism actions which Israel conducts during the Second Intifada. After Arafat's death and the second of the Second Intifada, however, U.S. and Israeli relations become warmer and Gore unsuccessfully makes a push for Israeli-Palestinian peace which fails due to Ehud Olmert's 2008 or 2009 resignation as a result of corruption allegations against him.

-Gore *might* militarily intervene in order to stop the genocide in Darfur, perhaps with the help of NATO; however, I am certainly *not* completely sure about this.

-North Korea probably does *not* build a nuclear weapon as early as it did in real life due to the fact that Gore, unlike Bush, would probably *not* be unequivocally hostile to North Korea.

-Without the Iraq War, U.S. relations with Europe would be better and warmer than they were under the Bush Administration in real life.

Some Republican (maybe someone such as George Allen; U.S. President between 2009 and 2017):

-Once the Arab Spring occurs, the U.S. and NATO still overthrow Muammar Gaddafi's regime in Libya. Likewise, NATO (including the U.S.) and Iran launch a joint large-scale military operation/campaign to overthrow Saddam Hussein during the Arab Spring due to the fact that the Arab Spring provides a good opportunity to do this. Afterwards, Iraq either gets partitioned into two or three separate countries or becomes a semi-functioning Shiite-led democracy which gives large autonomy to its various ethnic groups and regions. However, the process of stabilizing Iraq after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein could take a while, just like it did in real life.

-Likewise, the U.S. provides a large amount of assistance (including lethal military aid) to both opponents of Assad's regime in Syria and to the Ukrainian government (who are fighting against Russian-supported rebels in Eastern Ukraine). In turn, this results in Assad eventually getting overthrown in Syria and to a more difficult fight for Russia in Ukraine but one which Russia nevertheless still manages to eventually "win".

-The U.S. is no more successful at making peace between Israel and the Palestinians between 2009 and 2017 in this scenario than it was either under Bill Clinton or under Al Gore.

-North Korea withdraws from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and successfully builds and tests nuclear weapons sometime between 2009 and 2017.

Anyway, what exactly am I forgetting to list/state here?

Also, does anyone have any thoughts in regards to any of this? 




 Both make Jews run faster!

(Sorry, but as an agnostic Jew myself, I hope that it's okay for me to make this joke.) 




 For the record, I myself say Yes due to the fact that Pakistan will be unable to ever get a better offer than this and due to the fact that this will allow Pakistan to spend *much* less on defense and thus *much* more on improving the lives of its population. 




 Both make Jews run faster!

(Sorry, but as an agnostic Jew myself, I hope that it's okay for me to make this joke.) 




 that she went to the funeral naked! 




 OK--basically, I (the OP here) am a 22-year-old gender-fluid/cross-dreaming male who would like to get castrated (Yes, castrated, as in getting my testicles removed) and is willing to do whatever it takes in order to get this done.

Now, why exactly do I want to get castrated? Well, first of all, I would like to get sterilized in a way which cannot ever fail (after all of the remaining sperm in my body already die off, that is). Vasectomies can fail, all other available contraceptives can fail, and as for Vasalgel, it is way too untested for me. Plus, I have never heard anyone give me an extremely good reason as for why exactly Vasalgel is incapable of ever failing. The fact that Vasalgel hasn't failed yet doesn't necessarily mean that it will never fail for anyone; after all, I would think that vasectomies likewise had a 100% effectiveness rate before the first historical vasectomy failure actually occurred.

Also, before anyone brings up the idea of me only having sex with women who share my own views in regards to pregnancy, I would like to point out that I would never rely on any woman's word that she will get an abortion (or give our hypothetical future offspring for adoption, for that matter); after all, a woman can simply change her mind on this later on.

Also, abstaining from vaginal sex with all fertile and potentially fertile women for the rest of my life is likewise both completely unrealistic and completely unacceptable for me.

Thus, I have to take matters into my own hands and seek out castration (Yes, castration, as in the removal of both of my testicles) by any means necessary. Afterwards, I will need to utilize hormone replacement therapy in order to deal with the less pleasant effects of castration.

Also, I would like to point out that I would like to regulate my sex drive and that, as a gender-fluid/cross-dreaming person, I might very well want to take female hormones after my planned castration if I am still (somehow) able to indefinitely get erections (using my penis, which I intend to keep indefinitely) afterwards. I mean, the idea of me becoming a six-foot-tall beauty strongly appeals to me, and not in a sexual way. Indeed, whenever I shave my face, I am always reminded of just how incredibly beautiful of a (trans-)woman I would make. :) However, at the same time, just to be safe, I want to keep all of my options open in regards to which hormone replacement therapy I should take after my planned castration (Yes, castration).

Anyway, what I am wondering is if anyone who is either a eunuch or a trans-woman can give me my advice in regards to utilizing hormone replacement therapy (either kind) and in regards to living a life without gonads in general. In addition, I would also like to hear about the sex lives of eunuchs, specifically in regards to erections, orgasm, et cetera, since this information is certainly of personal interest to me. Also, if anyone has any additional information which I might be interested in, then please don't hesitate to share this information with me!

Also, one more question--exactly how long will I need to wait after castration in order to be completely sure that all of the remaining sperm in my body are already dead?

And Yes, if anyone has any doubts in regards to this, this is certainly a completely serious post. 




 After all, the money from this sale can be used to help finance Syria's reconstruction after its years-long civil war.

Thoughts on this? 




 For the record, I am personally going to say No because I expect another recession to begin in the U.S. sometime between 2018 and 2020, which in turn will result in Hillary Clinton either losing reelection in 2020 or not seeking reelection in the first place. After all, an economy can't keep growing non-stop forever. 




 What exactly are your thoughts on this wedding song?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FULXLzn4Gl0

(Love of My Life - The Wedding Song by Darla Day)

Personally, as someone who is a Pastafarian on my good days and an agnostic on my bad days, I strongly like this wedding song despite its religious tones. After all, it just sounds so beautiful and wonderful! :)

Also, while I myself am too young to get married, say, within the next decade, I might decide to use this wedding song when I will eventually get married (if my future wife will be okay with it, that is). After all, the references to "God" in this song can certainly be interpreted as references to the Pastafarian God. ;)

 I myself am pro-choice, but I tend to view things from both sides in order to see where exactly one is coming from.

That said--do you agree with the statement above? 




 Back when I was in middle school, I had a very tall teacher named Richard; looking back, I should have called him Big Dick. Also, it is worth noting that Big Dick was hard but pleasurable and that all of the teachers at my former middle school liked Big Dick. As of right now, Big Dick is currently the assistant principal at that very same middle school; thus, one can certainly be surprised as how far Big Dick can go. ;)

Also, before anyone brings up the idea of me only having sex with women who share my own views in regards to pregnancy, I would like to point out that I would never rely on any woman's word that she will get an abortion (or give our hypothetical future offspring for adoption, for that matter); after all, a woman can simply change her mind on this later on.

Also, abstaining from vaginal sex with all fertile and potentially fertile women for the rest of my life is likewise both completely unrealistic and completely unacceptable for me.

Thus, I have to take matters into my own hands and seek out castration (Yes, castration, as in the removal of both of my testicles) by any means necessary. Afterwards, I will need to utilize hormone replacement therapy in order to deal with the less pleasant effects of castration.

Also, I would like to point out that I would like to regulate my sex drive and that, as a gender-fluid/cross-dreaming person, I might very well want to take female hormones after my planned castration if I am still (somehow) able to indefinitely get erections (using my penis, which I intend to keep indefinitely) afterwards. I mean, the idea of me becoming a six-foot-tall beauty strongly appeals to me, and not in a sexual way. However, at the same time, just to be safe, I want to keep all of my options open in regards to which hormone replacement therapy I should take after my planned castration (Yes, castration).

Anyway, what I am wondering is if anyone who is either a eunuch or a trans-woman can give me my advice in regards to utilizing hormone replacement therapy (either kind) and in regards to living a life without gonads in general. In addition, I would also like to hear about the sex lives of eunuchs, specifically in regards to erections, orgasm, et cetera, since this information is certainly of personal interest to me. Also, if anyone has any additional information which I might be interested in, then please don't hesitate to share this information with me!

Also, one more question--exactly how long will I need to wait after castration in order to be completely sure that all of the remaining sperm in my body are already dead?

And Yes, if anyone has any doubts in regards to this, this is certainly a completely serious post. 


































 What exactly would have happened afterwards? How exactly would the history of Israel over the last seven years have been different?

Any thoughts on this? 




 What exactly would have happened afterwards? How exactly would the history of Israel over the last seven years have been different?

Any thoughts on this? 




  First of all. Welcome to the subreddit, Israeli friend. I would like to first acknowledge that I wish Pakistan recognizes Israel and establishes diplomatic ties, as this is probably the sanest thing to do, considering the Arabs have never spoken a word for Pakistan's Kashmir dispute.

Great to hear! :) Also, for the record, one can recognize Israel without supporting all of Israel's policies.

The BBC offers scenarios of possible solutions to the conflict: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/south_asia/03/kashmir_future/html/default.stm

Yes, I saw that BBC page before. :)

I am of Kashmiri heritage.

OK.

The Kashmiris are a muslim majority nation, and are only in India because of Maharaja Hari Singh's (a hindu) decision to join India, with complete disregard to the views of the Muslim masses living in his state, who wanted to join Pakistan.

As far as I know, though, Hari Singh only chose to join India due to the fact that Pashtun forces from Pakistan had already invaded Kashmir by that point in time.

India's PM at the time, Nehru, promised the Kashmiris that their right of self-determination will be met, and "India is not fond of forced marriages". Unfortunately, that promise was not kept.

Well, if Pakistan would have been willing to withdraw all of its troops from Kashmir in the late 1940s and/or in the early 1950s, then maybe a U.N.-sponsored plebiscite would have occurred in Kashmir.

Let me assure you, most Kashmiris today either desire independence or to join Pakistan - and they do not want to join India. And they do not want the LoC to remain a border between their nation.

Well, at the very least, I will say that a majority of the people in the Kashmir Valley almost certainly prefer independence.

An internationally-monitored referendum should be held in Kashmir, with 3 choices: 1. Independence from both nations. 2. Join Pak. 3. Join India.

That would have been great, especially back in 1947 before the British left.

However, it might be both too late and a bad move to hold such a referendum in Kashmir right now:

http://www.rediff.com/news/report/eu/20070306.htm

India will never allow this because Kashmiris will most likely opt for independence or merger with Pakistan. Merger with India WILL NOT happen. I assure you. So I will discuss only 2 scenarios that are most likely to happen.

Well, there is also the matter that, as far as I know, any territorial changes to India require an amendment to the Indian Constitution.

Scenario 1: Independence. Kashmiris from Pakistan and India unite to form a nation. Their flag will be very similar to Pakistan, and their national language will be Urdu, just like Pakistan (most Kashmiris are Urdu speakers). They will form a state very similar to Pakistan and Afghanistan. Over the course of decades and centuries, eventually this landlocked nation will join very close ties with its more culturally-close and religiously native neighbour, Pakistan. They will be so interlinked, that I can predict that within a 100 years of Kashmiri independence there will be a merger with Pakistan or form a very very close relationship, a defensive or economic union.

Good luck getting India to agree to this, though.

Scenario 2: Pakistan merger. Personally, I want this to occur. But I would like Jammu to stay with India since they are majority Hindu and don't want to merge with Pakistan. If this scenario is to occur, it should be everything north of River Chenab to join Pakistan, and below to join India.

I don't think that the people in either the Kashmir Valley or Ladakh (which I think is Buddhist-majority) want to join Pakistan, though. Heck, the people in Ladakh might prefer Indian rule instead.

Also, for the record, my solution here isn't meant to be fair. Rather, it is meant to be realistic. If there is a way to restore the 1947 demographic situation in all of Kashmir, then maybe, just maybe a plebiscite should occur. However, I am unsure if this is possible to do; after all, how good was record-keeping in Kashmir back in 1947? 




 Two questions:

1. How many people in India and Pakistan are able to prove their ancestors' place of residence back in 1947?

2. Didn't Pakistan allow many people from other parts of the country to settle in Kashmir after 1947? 




  I know you meant this as a "realistic" solution, but I think your bias is showing.

Well, like it or not, but realities aren't always pleasant.

In every option you gave, it's either "have Pakistan recognise this", "have Pakistan recognise that",

Yes; correct!

not to mention the joke about India paying an "extremely tiny" bit of compensation to Pakistan for the Siachen glacier (that was a joke, right?).

No, it wasn't; rather, it was a serious proposal. After all, why exactly should India give Pakistan a lot of money in compensation for a glacier where no one lives?

Though you may have been sincere in that suggestion, there's no amount of money India could ever offer Pakistan to withdraw it's claim to disputed territory.

Even to a glacier where no one lives?

It's unrealistic to think Pakistan would accept such an offer anyway.

Then I don't think that you will be able to have peace with India.

 The most realistic (and fair) way is like /u/GuyOnToilet said, to hold a referendum in Kashmir (with UN oversight) and allow the Kashmiris to decide their future,

Didn't Pakistan, unlike India, allow people from other parts of the country to settle in its part of Kashmir after 1947, though? If so, then such a referendum might be unfair to India.

(However, I will admit that such a referendum *should* have been held back in 1947, before the British left.)

whether India would respect the result of such a referendum is another issue entirely, they certainly didn't when it came to Junagadh.

Weren't the referendum results in Junagadh extremely strongly *in favor* of India, though? 




 For the record, I myself am certainly *not* a Pakistani. In fact, I don't think that Pakistan even recognizes my birth country (Israel). Thus, to accuse me of being biased in favor of Pakistan here would be ludicrous. 




 If they don't like it, and they can, you know, move (back) to Israel. 




 No, she isn't. :) 




 Huh? 




 In other words, a pharmacist. 




 Huh? 




 This woman needs a lot of jail time, a lot of mental health treatment, or both of these things. :( 




 I normally hate Assad's guts, but in this specific case, I will say this:

Way to go Assad! :) Keep it coming! :) Woot woot! :) 




 That would ideally be great, but the problem is that, as far as I know, not everyone who or whose family left Kashmir after 1947 would be able to prove that they previously lived in Kashmir. 




  It's sad these people will have children

This *can* certainly be dealt with, though. ;) 




 Donald Rumsfeld and Saddam Hussein in 1983--BFFs for sure:

 Also, what about non-binary people? Or does Iran not recognize non-binary gender identities? 




 This might give Pakistan an unfair advantage, though. After all, as far as I know, Pakistan, unlike India, *did* change the demographics of its part of Kashmir after 1947-1948. 




 Sexist Persians. :( 




 Why *isn't* this funny? 




 Any thoughts on this? 




 Homo ... erectus. ;) 




 No, but they did a lot of other bullshit back then. :( 




 And yet we are supposed to be fighting for freedom and women's rights there. :( 




 Unfortunately some Muslim countries are still even more backwards than Hell is. :( What a shame and a tragedy. :( 




 Well, at least Russia respects the U.S. :) That's certainly a good start. :) 




 To the Jewish Ice Cream Taste Question. ;) 




 Nazi ice cream! ;) Run for your lives! ;) 




 Yep. :) 




 Any thoughts on this? 




 I am sorry, but can you please rephrase what you said here? 
























 Any thoughts on this? 




 Yes, some of them do. 




 Well, if necessary, Israel and/or someone else can use force in order to achieve this goal. 




 Also, though, for the record, there *is* another solution which India can try doing in regards to this, but it can get *extremely* nasty:

1. Have India propose my solution for Kashmir to Pakistan.
2. When Pakistan refuses, have India eliminate Kashmir's autonomy and encourage large-scale immigration of Hindus to Kashmir, especially to the Kashmir Valley.
3. If Pakistan responds to this by increasing its support of terrorism, then have India begin supporting terrorist groups inside of Pakistan (such as the Pakistani Taliban and Baluch separatists).
4. When Pakistan will complain about India changing the demographics of Kashmir, point out that Pakistan's friend and ally China is doing the same thing in Xinjiang and that Pakistan always appears to have been quiet about this.
5. Offer to restore Kashmir's autonomy if Pakistan agrees to recognize both the Line of Control and the Line of Actual Control (on the Siachen Glacier) as the permanent international border between India and Pakistan.

There--how exactly is that (other than *extremely* nasty, obviously)? 




  The nations that would be acceptable to both- Scandinavian countries, etc.- are not nations that have traditionally looked to be international peacebrokers at all, let alone in South Asia. The only exception is France, and even then the French limit their international role to their former colonies (primarily West Africa).

Then bribe the French to agree to do this.

 I'm not sure it would, as those factions (e.g., military) looking for total control of Kashmir would see such an action as strengthening the case for the LoC to become the border, thus weakening their stance.

It might be hard for them to effectively make this argument considering that Pakistan has already agreed to the Simla Agreement more than 40 years ago, though. After all, the Simla Agreement states that neither India nor Pakistan will use force to solve the Kashmir dispute and that neither India nor Pakistan will go beyond the Line of Control.

 Oh okay, I'd though you meant to use them as an example- African forces (it seems to be mostly Ethiopia and Rwanda) that act as Peacekeepers may work on the small scale in Africa (which is where they tend to be deployed), but a mission to Kashmir would be far, far more internationally high-profile, would demand far more manpower, and would be fundamentally different from their standard role, which is prevention of civil wars in Africa.

 I'm not sure African nations would commit to troops in Kashmir- quasi-state-sponsored, seasoned partisans are not the same as African warlord guerrillas.

What about if African nations are bribed enough (as in, given enough money) to agree to this, though? Would that work for this?

 I agree, but unfortunately that's not something achievable with diplomacy.

Agreed, unfortunately. :(

 Would this necessarily be a bad thing in the long(er)-run, though? 




 Maybe, but if the U.S. and/or someone else will succeed in removing *all* of Pakistan's nuclear weapons in time, then this civil war might not be that catastrophic and might actually (and ironically) result in some good in the long(er)-run. 




 Yes, this appears to be accurate. Of course, with my proposal, UN peacekeepers would need to be the ones who will be manning the borders.

Also, though, I would like to point out that if one can resolve the Kashmir dispute in a mutually agreeable way *without* holding a plebiscite there, then one can get rid of the plebiscite part of my solution to the Kashmir dispute. The purpose of the plebiscite in my solution to this was to give civilian Pakistani politicians a way to save face so that they could not be accused of making peace with India at the expense of the Kashmiri people. 




  Part of their traditional neutrality is that they definitely don't do this kind of thing- they keep to themselves.

In that case, though, what about Sweden or France? Also, Norway or Iceland might work for this as well, as might Austria. Any thoughts on this? After all, there must be *some* country which would be willing to do this and which would be acceptable to both India and Pakistan.

No problem! The issue then is that the original Step 3 (greater interaction/trade) wouldn't be possible as a means of getting a border resolution, as Step 3 would itself need a border resolution to happen.

Actually, I might know a compromise in regards to this: Pakistan might provisionally recognize the Line of Control as the permanent boundary between India and Pakistan (just like West Germany did with the Oder-Neisse Line in 1970) but reserve the right to withdraw this recognition afterwards. Meanwhile, a final Pakistani recognition of the Line of Control as the permanent boundary between India and Pakistan will only occur after a favorable result in the plebiscite which I mentioned (similarly, Germany gave final recognition to the Oder-Neisse Line in either 1990 or in 1991).

There--would that work for this?

Arbitration already works poorly enough in Africa, which can't harm western militaries without guerilla tactics. Pakistan has nukes and India is a rising superpower- this is a whole different ballgame.

Actually, I was talking about using African troops for a U.N. peacekeeping mission to Kashmir. I just want to clarify this part in order to make sure that you understood my point here correctly.

The issue is that the military faction wouldn't let the plebiscite happen at all precisely because of this.

Then have the Pakistanis launch a revolution or something against the military faction in Pakistan. After all, without this, there can probably never be a mutually acceptable peace between India and Pakistan. 




 Yeah--please say whatever you want to say in regards to this. 




 I recently thought about what exactly my ideal solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will be (this is a conflict which is of large personal interest to me due to the fact that I myself was born in Israel and still have Israeli citizenship right now).

Anyway:

-All Israeli settlements in the West Bank which are located near the border with Israel will be placed under Israeli sovereignty.

-All of the Jewish neighborhoods of East Jerusalem will remain under Israeli sovereignty.

-The Arab neighborhoods of East Jerusalem will have completely free and fair sovereignty referendums/plebiscites held there, with the final border in Jerusalem being drawn as closely as possible according to the results of these referendums/plebiscites.

-The Old City of Jerusalem would either be divided or become an international zone, with freedom of worship for all.

-The Palestinian refugees would be unable to return to Israel proper but they would be able to settle in the new Palestinian state. However, it would also be nice if these Palestinian refugees would get the option of remaining in the Arab countries where some of them are currently living and to acquire citizenship and full, equal rights in these Arab countries.

-The Palestinian state would need to be fully demilitarized; it will be allowed to have a police force to maintain order, but not an army.

-*All* terrorist organizations should be *fully/completely* disarmed, with this being verified by neutral observers.

-It would be nice if the Palestinians (with the help of the international community) bought the northeastern part of the Sinai Peninsula from Egypt in order to expand the Gaza Strip and thus help deal with the overpopulation which is currently occurring in the Gaza Strip.

-Israeli settlers who will end up in the new Palestinian state should be allowed to remain there if they agree to fully respect all Palestinian laws and to become Palestinian citizens. They will be able to keep their Israeli citizenship if they want, though.

-The Palestinian state will receive territorial compensation of equal area and as much equal quality as possible for the areas of the West Bank which Israel will annex/keep.

-*All* incitement on both sides might stop and be made illegal.

Am I missing anything here?

Also, how exactly does this list look? 




 Yes, I do. 




  Well that's a good thought. But waiting for decades doesn't seems like the solution. About 15 years should be enough.

Yes, 15 or 20 years might be good enough for this. However, if the first plebiscite in regards to this fails, then there will need to be another plebiscite in regards to this at some future point in time.

 And some patriotic Indians will all cry on this thread. They don't think about humanity but fulfill their own selfishness.

Why, though? After all, my solution here is *not* going to cause India to lose *any* of its territory. 




 Yes, Step #3 here is certainly crucial. However, all of the steps in my solution will need to be fulfilled in order for a permanent peace to be achieved between India and Pakistan. :)

Also, in regards to Russia, I don't think that its problems have as much to do with it still being in land-grabbing mode as with the fact that there is still a lot of corruption and a lot of dependence on natural resources for Russia's economy growth and prosperity. 




  Pakistan is a 'US ally'- there's no way the State Dept. would ever put itself in the position to potentially internationally arbitrate that Pakistan supports terrorists.

Very good point; thus, what about Switzerland? Would Switzerland work for this?

Except that would involve basically a massive political change/revolution in Pakistan, if not an invasion (... as in 1945 Germany).

Agreed.

Somewhere between India and Pakistan there needs to be a point at which people cross the economic border and are subject to import laws. This means one of two things needs to happen:

1. India and Pakistan set up a customs border along the line of control... which would be a de facto international border, which is really what the whole crisis is about in the first place.

2. India and Pakistan both treat the whole Kashmir region as outside their national borders, meaning people could move freely within Kashmir but would need to cross a border to enter India or Pakistan.

Thanks for clarifying this part. In this case, your suggestion #1 would be the one which needs to be implemented.

They would probably help with the vote itself, but a vote of this magnitude would have a massive danger of violence and tampering attached. You'd need UN Peacekeeping troops, and I don't know what country would willingly supply them.

What about some African countries, though?

I don't think it would- a vote in favor of India would be a massive slap in the face to the nationalistic and military factions in Pakistan.

Yes, it might be a slap in the face to them, but it will allow moderate Pakistani civilian politicians to save face by arguing that Pakistan didn't make peace with India at the expense of the Kashmiri people. 




 Good luck with that, though. After all, Pakistan already has *a lot* of nuclear weapons. 




 Does a country need to withdraw all of its forces from a particular area for a plebiscite to take place, though? In other words, would the U.N. be able to keep peace, quiet, and order in Kashmir if *zero* Pakistani and Indian forces were placed there at the time of this plebiscite?

Also, for the record, this plebiscite is meant to allow Pakistan to save face in regards to recognizing both the Line of Control and the Line of Actual Control (on the Siachen Glacier) as the permanent international border between India and Pakistan. 




 Well, if my first step here is not going to be fulfilled, then I don't think that one can have a mutually agreeable solution to the Kashmir dispute. 




 OK--anyway, here is my solution to the Kashmir dispute. This solution is not meant to be the fairest, but rather the most realistic in regards to having it be accepted by both India and Pakistan:

Step 1: Have Pakistan withdraw all of its support for Kashmiri terrorists and insurgents.

Step 2: Have both India and Pakistan (somewhat) reduce their military presence in Kashmir.

Step 3: Allow greater interaction, trade, and cooperation between Indian-controlled Kashmir and Pakistani-controlled Kashmir.

Step 4: After at least a couple of decades, hold a plebiscite in both Indian-controlled Kashmir and Pakistani-controlled Kashmir which asks the residents there if they approve of making the current situation in Kashmir permanent as well as in making the Line of Control the permanent international border between India and Pakistan.

Step 5: If this plebiscite is approved by voters in both parts of Kashmir, then have Pakistan recognize the Line of Control as the permanent international border between India and Pakistan. If this plebiscite is rejected by at least one of the sides, then seek an alternative formula for Kashmir, very possibly along at least somewhat similar lines.

Step 6: Have Pakistan agree to make the Line of Actual Control on the Siachen Glacier the permanent international border between India and Pakistan. Since this will give India permanent sovereignty at least most of the Siachen Glacier, India will pay an [b]extremely[/b] tiny amount of compensation to Pakistan in order for Pakistan to save face in regards to this.

Step 7: Have India and Pakistan make love rather than war. ;)

There--how exactly is all of that? 




  It'd be great if this happened, but:
 Pakistan will claim it already doesn't support them, so there would have to be some sort of third-party judgement by an agreed-upon arbitrator as to whether Pakistan supports terrorists or not (and what 'support' means). I don't think any country, or the UN, would put itself in that position.

How about the U.S., though?

Also, without an end to terrorism and to the Kashimiri insurgency, I don't see it being advantageous to India to open up Kashmir's borders. After all, this could allow more insurgents and terrorists to come to India, and India certainly doesn't want that.

 Kashmir is pretty much all their respective militaries do, and I don't know much about India's but Pakistan's has massive political power- they thrive off border tensions, and I can't see why they'd agree to a lessening of force.

I would presume that the role of Pakistan's military in this scenario would need to be decreased (similar to how the German military's role significantly decreased after 1945).

 How? Where is the customs border?

I am sorry, but can you please elaborate on this part?

Would each country be forced to treat their respective national 'borders' with the entire Kashmir contested region as international boundaries?

Yes, they would.

Also, how does this consider deliberate settlement to skew demographics for the future plebiscite?

How about only allowing those people who or whose ancestors lived in Kashmir in 1947 (or at some other year) to vote in this plebiscite? Would that work?

 Again, a vote would need to be run by an agreed-upon international third party arbitrator.

How about having the U.N. monitor this vote, then?

In this case, I don't think it would happen, seeing as I don't think either country really cares what the residents' opinion on the matter is.

Yes, you might very well be correct on this, though Pakistan has frequently voiced support for the aspirations of the Kashmiris. Of course, voicing support for this is different from actually supporting the aspirations of the Kashimiris.

Anyway, though, this plebiscite will allow Pakistan to save face in regards to this. 




 OK--anyway, here is my solution to the Kashmir dispute. This solution is not meant to be the fairest, but rather the most realistic in regards to having it be accepted by both India and Pakistan:

 Unfortunately, it is not completely original. 




 Any thoughts on this? 




 Yes, I know that I am hastily generalizing here, but my point here is still a valid one, especially when comparing science-minded people with, say, Young Earth Creationists. 




 Can I just buy something with these $10 instead, though? 




 I am sorry about your anxiety in regards to this. :( Ideally, transgender people shouldn't feel compelled to remain in the closet.

Also, thank you very much for this information about bottom surgery. I've got a question, though--can't a penis pump significantly help with getting erections and whatnot?

In addition, exactly how much does your testosterone replacement therapy cost? Also, did you experience any unpleasant consequences/side effects of taking testosterone, or has your experience with testosterone so far been fully pleasant? 




 Also, out of curiosity, exactly how much does your testosterone replacement therapy cost? 




 What exactly does a meta stand for, though?

Also, how exactly do you deal with any possible unpleasant consequences of testosterone replacement therapy (such as an increased cancer risk)? Serious question, for the record.

In addition, how exactly did your emotions and personality change before and after you began taking testosterone? 




 Transphobes are certainly vile scum, but I thought that money itself does not have any views. After all, the recipient of a monetary donation gets to decide what to do with this donation, correct?

Also, since the Girl Scouts are returning this money, should Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation likewise return all of the money that she and it received from misogynistic and homophobic countries? Serious question, for the record.

Any thoughts on this? 




 I suppose that the mentality in regards to doing this is "Better safe than sorry." 




 This question is certainly not meant to offend anyone; rather, I am simply very curious about this: If you are a trans-man and got rid of your gonads, got a penis, and/or are using testosterone replacement therapy, then what exactly is this experience like for you? Is dealing with things such as testosterone replacement therapy pretty easy? Are you pleased with the functioning of your penises (if you already have penises, that is)?

Any thoughts on any of this? 




  Jesus they take 5 cm!!

Yes--at least, that's what I heard. 




  Wow. If you don't mind sharing, why?

Because all non-drastic methods of contraception and sterilization appear to be capable of failure and because castration plus female hormones might end up being very useful for things such as feminizing my face as well as reducing my sex drive.

I can't imagine myself being in a situation where I would even consider those options unless my life was threatened

Well, you appear to be more tolerant of the risk of an unplanned pregnancy and its consequences than I am (assuming that you are a cis-man, of course). Plus, I am presuming that you, unlike myself, don't cross-dream, correct? 




 No; heck, if anything, vasectomy is actually pretty mild in comparison to what I intend to do (castration/orchiectomy).

Rather, I am simply curious to hear if there have been any known cases of what exactly I am talking about here. 




 If so, then I would please like to hear your story. :) 




 No problem! :) 




 Can't a judge state that one part of the U.S. Constitution overrides an earlier part of the U.S. Constitution, though? 




 Congratulations to the Kurds! :) Hopefully their success in regards to ISIS will continue! :) 









 Maybe you are correct on this; I am not completely sure.

However, I did previously see an article in what appears to be a legal journal which argues in favor of having a court ruling get rid of the natural-born U.S. citizen requirement for the U.S. Presidency:

http://repository.jmls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1287 context=lawreview

Any thoughts on this article? 




 In such a case, I would be skeptical of their claims, but I would still like to hear them out. 



















 You can't hear numbers. ;) 




 Not in French, you can't. ;) 




 Thank you very much for sharing all of this information. :) 




  At the time the constitution was written, the founders only had to look back a few years to King George I, whose lack of apparent interest in England and commitment to Hanover could serve as a reminder.

OK.

But I recall a more recent example of a head of state of Germany who expended a great deal of energy attempting, with success, to annex his natal country. Needless to say, it didn't end well.

It didn't end well, but this was a result of Hitler being a poor decision-maker--not the result of Hitler being a naturalized German citizen. 




  Not to my knowledge, but how many countries allow foreign-born people to run for President? Isn't that a fairly common restriction in many democracies?

Actually, I don't think that this is the case in most European democracies.

For example, Mexico requires not only that you be a natural-born citizen, but that at least one of your parents are as well. They also require that you not be an official of any church, nor be currently serving the in military.

I would suspect that any country that based their democracy off of the US model would have similar requirements.

Yes, but this doesn't appear to apply to the democracies in the "Old World." 




 I've got a question, though--can't this requirement be gotten rid of by a court ruling as well? As in, some activist judge finds something within the U.S. Constitution which he or she claims overrules the natural-born U.S. citizen requirement in the U.S. Constitution.

Any thoughts on this? 




 In other words, religious people can have an excuse for everything.

Any thoughts on this? 




 Also, for the record, the question of mine which you quoted here still has a lot of merit. *Have* there ever been any such cases (in any country)? 




  When the Constitution was written, it was pretty common to marry into the ruling family of another country and use that as leverage to take over. That was pretty much the standard operating procedure of European politics for hundreds of years.

Sure, but the U.S. wasn't a monarchy even back in the late 1700s.

 The original intent of this clause was to prevent someone like King George (or a French/Austrian/Spanish king) from running for and winning the presidency of the newly founded American democracy, thus returning to European rule. Remember, a monarchy would have very, very deep pockets to fund an election in the colonies if they tried it (much greater than any competitor).

Yes, I think that you are correct in regards to this.

This wasn't outside the realm of possibility in 1783.

Agreed.

I don't believe the original intent was primarily xenophobic or discriminatory as we'd consider those terms today.

The original intent? Very possibly not, but nowadays this part of the U.S. Constitution is very much xenophobic and discriminatory.

 While I think there is merit to discussing whether we still need such a protection today,

If so, then I am interested in hearing your thoughts on this. :)

I'd disagree with your assertion that it had little to no value in the past.

Did I ever outright say that, though? What I think I said was that it outlived whatever value it ever had in the past. In other words, I did not say whether or not it had any value in the past; rather, what I said is that regardless of the answer to this question, this requirement has no value today. 




 Yes, I think that you are correct in regards to this. :) 




 My view on this is is pretty simple:

The "natural-born U.S. citizen" requirement for the U.S. Presidency should be eliminated. It is xenophobic, discriminatory, treats naturalized U.S. citizens as second-class citizens, outlived whatever value it ever had, and creates a slippery slope.

In regards to the value of this requirement, let me ask one this--have there ever been any cases of naturalized citizens democratically coming to power in a particular country and then betraying their adopted country's interests in favor of their birth country's interests? Also, Adolf Hitler certainly does *not* qualify for this, considering that Hitler did not sacrifice Germany's interests in favor of Austria's interests; if anything, he got rid of the independence of his birth country (Austria) and allowed his adopted country (Germany) to annex his birth country.

As for the slippery slope part, I would like to point out that, as far as I know, a similar rationale which is used to deny naturalized U.S. citizens the U.S. Presidency was previously used to justify the forced internment of Japanese-Americans (a majority of whom I think were U.S. citizens) during World War II. Likewise, a similar paranoia existed in some Americans' minds when Roman Catholics Al Smith (in 1928) and JFK (in 1960) ran for the U.S. Presidency due to their fear that they would take orders from the Pope. This is what I meant in regards to the slippery slope part.

If a naturalized U.S. citizen who runs for the U.S. Presidency seems suspicious, then the American voters can simply not elect this candidate in the first place, just like they can avoid electing natural-born U.S. citizens who are running for the U.S. Presidency and who seem suspicious. However, in the name of equality, naturalized U.S. citizens should certainly be allowed to run for the U.S. Presidency just like naturalized citizens can already become the head of state and/or the head of government in many countries worldwide today. Plus, it is worth noting that many naturalized U.S. citizens could have been better U.S. Presidents than people such as George W. Bush actually were in real life. After all, naturalized U.S. citizens might appreciate the U.S. and U.S. citizenship more than natural-born U.S. citizens (some/many of whom might take it for granted) do.

Anyway, if someone wants to try changing my mind on this, then please do so.

 Who the Hell is Johna? 




 No, I don't. 














 In comparison to whom, exactly? 














 "She" meaning one's wife or one's wife's friend? I just want to clarify this part. 




 If so, though, then wouldn't that mean that he himself is (secretly) gay or bisexual? 




 Are you talking about this guy here? :

http://cdn-www.i-am-bored.com/media/thumbnails/carth.jpg 




 And if it isn't? 














 Before or after she cleans herself up, though? 









 Yep. ;) 














 http://rs2img.memecdn.com/isis-supports-gay-rights_o_4120639.jpg

Well, I can dream, can't I? ;) 




  That may have been a good clue.

And your statement here may have been the understatement of the year. ;) 




 What a shame! ;) After all, I already spent a lot of money on popcorn! ;) 














 Yes, I am aware of Israel's Law of Return. However, when I lived in Israel, I don't think that I was officially considered to be Jewish due to the religious definition of a Jew. 




 No, I don't think so. 




 Are you talking about this movie here? :

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_(film)

If so, then No. 




 Out of curiosity--what exactly do you mean by this? 




 This badass:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_von_Lettow-Vorbeck 




 Being Jewish according to Jewish law. 




 Any thoughts on this? 









 OK. Will do! :) 




 Yes; that was a typo on my part.

Should I create a new thread with the correct spelling, or what? 




 Can someone please fix my typo here? I obviously meant to write "Hungarian" instead of "Hugnarian" in my thread title here. 









 Thank you, Arnold! :) (not sarcasm) 




 What if German President Paul Von Hindenburg decided to retire in 1932 after Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck agrees to run in his place?

Would Lettow-Vorbeck have defeated Hitler in 1932? If so, then Hitler and the Nazis probably never come to power in Germany in the legal way considering that Lettow-Vorbeck very strongly hated Hitler's guts. However, since the Nazis cannot come to power in Germany legally in this scenario, do they attempt to launch a repeat of their 1923 coup attempt but on a much larger scale once the Nazis determine that their electoral support has probably already peaked? Also, do the German Communists attempt to launch their own coup in this scenario (with the support of the Soviet Union, of course)? Could Germany have descended into full-blown civil war (between the German government, the Nazis, and the Communists) in 1933 or 1934 in this scenario? If so, then how exactly does this German civil war turn out? Also, how does this German civil war affect the outcome of the 1935 Saar plebiscite?

Also, how exactly would Lettow-Vorbeck have handled the German economy as well as German foreign relations? Likewise, would Lettow-Vorbeck have ran for re-election in 1939? If so, then would he have won re-election in 1939?

In addition, how exactly would German history in the 1940s, 1950s, and beyond have developed in this scenario?

Any thoughts on any of this?

Also, for reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_von_Lettow-Vorbeck

 Nope; here is some reading for you to do:

http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/27/us/supreme-court-homosexual-rights-justices-6-3-legalize-gay-sexual-conduct.html 




  It's not really a lot of time, most of the time sex for me lasts a while. It's just foreplay.

Understood; thanks for clarifying this part.

I'm not even sure what that means lol. I'm me I guess hehe. I'm mtf trans and I'm just like ehh I'm done and I don't see it necessary to spend money on surgery I personally don't need.

What I meant was this--do you identify as female all of the time (as opposed to only a part of the time)? Serious question, for the record. 




 Nope, simply from a personally curious genderqueer person. 




  Umm it depends a lot on the mood I'm in, if I'm being actively aroused by someone, and if they are doing things that are particularly arousing. It's like asking herding cats a bit. So I can't really put a number on it, but I'll give a ROUND number of maybe like 30-45 minutes to get good and erect maybe?

That seems like a lot of time, though.

No I don't intend to. I like it where it is.

Understood; also, out of curiosity, do you yourself identify as a binary trans-woman? 




 Apologies for asking, but exactly how long do you concentrate before you can get an erection using your penis?

Also, out of pure curiosity, do you ever plan to get rid of your penis and to get a vagina in its place? 




 OK--this is a question which is of personal interest to me (Yes, I am completely, 100% serious in regards to this)--if a genderqueer person who is physically a eunuch (as in, this individual was born with a male body and then became a eunuch) takes female hormones for several years and then begins taking male hormones, then would he/she be able to get erections using his/her penis?

Any thoughts on this? 














 In your honest opinion, what exactly are the best all-you-can-eat buffets in Orange County, California?

The answer to this question is of personal interest to me considering that I myself live in SoCal and absolutely *love* food. :) 









 Any thoughts on this? 




 Any thoughts on this? 



















 After all, I myself love to eat, but I am also *extremely* open to the idea of me taking female hormones in the future. (Also, Yes, I have a lot of desires and issues that I need to deal with, as you can tell by my Reddit posting history.) Thus, is there any way for me to take female hormones and to still have a large metabolism afterwards?

Any thoughts on this? 







































 Maybe the McRib; I mean, just look at it:

http://grub.gunaxin.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/mcrib1.jpg

 




 Stewie Griffin from Family Guy?

After all, he was initially a matricidal-minded evil genius because he became a flaming gay drama queen. ;) 




 Because Xerkule previously used the word "men" rather than "male." 




 Either Jackass: The Movie or American Pie. 




 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8iqEfje7Aw
 




 It *doesn't* detract from the point. 




 Good points. :) 




 Well, come on! After all, I *must* know this information! ;) You see, I'm an NSA agent and we're compiling a database of this information, so yeah. ;) 




 Yes; correct! 




  The quick and dirty way is to see who has a bigger, newer air force. modern jet fighters are imported and expensive and thus are a good barometer of how seriously the country in question is taking its defense spending. It is far from a perfect metric, and the thai airforce is a bit longer in the tooth than I would have expected, but on the whole it's very much superior.

Thanks for this info.

why would they want to?

Because Mongolia has a lot of natural resources?

Also, what about Russia conquering the Russian-majority parts of northern Kazakhstan in the event that Kazakhstan ever tries to, say, withdraw from the Eurasian Economic Union? 




 Just curious; after all, I want to compare your size to my own. :) #notcreepy 




 *All* the stupid people? Is Donald Trump from Florida? 




 So what *is* a statically relevant number? 




 Are you sure about that, though? 




 Israel doesn't commit terrorism, though. 




 South Carolina ... figures--those rednecks! :( 




 Why exactly were you worried about Florida, though? 




  You could arguably just call it american colonialism?

Why, though?

The situation just seems so bizarre that i doubt it could or would happen anywhere else. If anything, i would expect to see the proliferation of more national movements like, flanders, catalonia, kurdistan, than wanting to join another state.

Are there any other national movements which you have in mind which could be successful in the future, though? 




 Some women *do* give birth after age 40, though. Heck, even my own mom previously did this! 




 That might be due to cis-men's lack of an extra X chromosome and/or due to cis-men's greater level of testosterone in their bodies, though. 




 Because when one commits terrorism, one is not taking anything which belongs to another country for one's own use.

(P.S.: I myself obviously and certainly *don't* support terrorism, including by Iran.) 




 So toofine is being sarcastic? OK, that makes sense. However, it is worth noting that, as far as I know, more men smoke and get heart disease than women do. 




 How exactly do you know that Thailand is better armed than Malaysia, though?

Also, what about, say, China trying to reconquer Mongolia? 




 So are they making Russian food right now? After all, Vladimir Putin appears to be making a lot of effort to portray himself as a boogeyman in Western eyes over the last 1.5 years. 




 No, it isn't. 




 Fat exchanges, anyone? ;) 




 OK; understood. 




 What are you talking about, though? After all, women can certainly smoke and get heart disease, no? 




 Yes, because legalizing gay marriage is certainly going to encourage Australian cattle to have more gay sex and thus to breed less, correct? ;) 




 Understood. Also, out of pure curiosity--what exactly is your penis length when it is flaccid? 




 Funding terrorist groups certainly isn't the same as annexing a part of another country's territory, though. 




 Out of curiosity--if the "Little Ice Age" helped result in a shorter average height for Northern European men, then could this mean that global warming will help result in a taller average height for Northern European men?

Any thoughts on this? 




 That, and maybe poorer nutrition as well. 




 What about the Malay-majority parts of southern Thailand being annexed by Malaysia, though? 




 Agreed; however, for the record, ethnic Persians in Afghanistan are Sunnis, not Shiites. In contrast, ethnic Persians in Iran are overwhelmingly Shiite. 




 There! I fixed it! Is it better now? 




  Maybe, but they already do,

This won't be the case if sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program are lifted, though. 




 Yeah, I guess. English isn't my first language, so yeah. 




  6-7.5" seems about perfect for most girls.

Is that flaccid or erect, though? Serious question, for the record. 




 Yeah, a longer penis can be advantageous for more difficult terrain. ;) 




 10.5''? Is that when his cock is flaccid or when his cock is erect? Serious question, for the record. 




 Well, at least he can try getting a penectomy. ;) 




  and he can't understand why his business never got off the ground

His business might have never got *off* the ground, but at least his penis got *onto* the ground pretty quickly. ;) After all, after a certain amount of penis growth, one's penis *literally* reaches the ground. ;) 




 Porn ads are lies? 




 Completely agreed.

Indeed, I have recently heard a Persian refer to the people in southern Iraq as being just "a bunch of Arabs." Seriously. 




 I wasn't only talking about Russia making such a move, though. After all, other countries can likewise make such a move. 




 Agreed. ;) 




 You appear to have forgotten the fact that a *much* smaller number of women currently die as a result of childbirth than was previously the case (throughout the overwhelming majority of history). 




 End the war on drugs. Period.

Enough said. 




 OK; anything else, though? 




  Iran. Sorry, forgot to put that in there. Iran is a Shiite religion and so is Southern Iraq. I think Arab implies Sunni.

And yet many Arabs themselves would disagree with you that Arab implies Sunni.

 Iran doesn't care about the International community.

It appears to care enough about the international community to engage in serious negotiations with them over its nuclear program.

If it took Southern Iraq it would take control of the Mesopotamian river delta and control the oil flowing out of Iraq.

True; however, Iran would probably have to endure *massive* sanctions as a result of this annexation as well. 




  Well, it's important to remember that Crimea isn't really the first "Crimea".

Actually, it *is* the first "Crimea" in the 21st century.

Russia pulled almost the exact same stunt with Abkhazia and South Ossetia against Georgia,

By "almost," do you mean that Russia wanted to outright annex these two territories and then changed its mind at the last minute?

If so, then I would please like a source for this.

and Transnistria against Moldova.

Russia doesn't even recognize Transnistria's independence, though.

One could also argue that this is similar to what Israel is doing to Palestine.

If one compares it to Israel's 1980 annexation of East Jerusalem, then Yes, certainly. 




 Well, you can't blame me for being lazy. ;) 




 What else would China want other than Taiwan, though? 




 Seriously? 









 Who exactly will annex southern Iraq, though? After all, I don't think that Iran wants to significantly increase the number of Arabs under its rule. Plus, Iran already got in enough trouble with its nuclear program; thus, why exactly should Iran anger the international community even more by annexing southern Iraq? 




 Incestuous marriage and polygamy, of course. ;) 









 LOL cumbox! ;) 




 Uh ... religious Muslim conservatism. :( 




 Fuck Singapore. :( 




 The two atomic bombs weren't enough revenge for us, though. ;) 




 By "future Crimeas," I mean cases where a country sends some of its troops (or some of its "volunteers") to occupy a territory, quickly hold a referendum there, and then annex this territory. In fact, this is what Russia previously did (or appears to have done) in Crimea in early 2014.

Anyway, any thoughts on this? Also, Yes, this is certainly a completely serious question. 




 Much more women also historically died during childbirth; in turn, this also made women's life expectancy lower than it would have otherwise been. 














 *Much* bigger problems, in fact. 




 That Bush Jr. overthrew Saddam Hussein at least in part as a result of daddy issues. 




 You might be able to thank the Second Intifada for that, though. 




 OK; that said, though--wouldn't it have been more productive *not* to make jockstraps assless if they were only meant to be used for this purpose? 




  My apologies. I must have blinked and missed its moment in the sunshine.

Apology accepted. :)

 Sprang from nowhere and practically vanished to the same place, am I right?

Yes, you are correct in regards to this. However, Kadima only appears to have vanished after Mofaz brought Kadima into Netanyahu's coalition in 2012 and then accomplished nothing inside of this coalition. Had Mofaz not done that, then Kadima might still exist today. 




 Kadima was actually the *largest* party in the Knesset back in 2008, though. 




 You're welcome! :) 




 I guess so. ;) 




 Apparently these are the three songs in this video:

Keep Quiet (Original Mix) by Simon Patterson Feat. Lucy Pullin, 1998 (TyDi   Dennis Sheperd Remix) by Binary Finary and Silent Tears (Orjan Nilsen Remix) by Mark Sherry Feat. Sharone. 




 Convince my parents to invest *a lot* of money on various Intrade betting options, such as betting on an Obama victory in 2008. 









 Well, now you know the importance of time. ;)

On a more compassionate note, though, I'm sorry for your loss. :( 




 If a sushi chef is offended by this, then he or she shouldn't probably be making sushi in restaurants for a living in the first place. ;) 









 2 what? 




 Yes, I think so. 




 Any thoughts on this? 




 I don't smoke weed *at all*, though. Seriously. 




 Here you go:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlyn_Jenner 









 It's the current mentality of many Israeli *people*, though. 




 For the record, though, I will say this--it appears that Libya was a larger threat to Israel back in 2002-2003 than Iran is today. After all, unlike Iran, Libya actually *did* want to build nuclear weapons in 2002-2003 (and earlier as well). In this regard, I am certainly extremely happy that the U.S. and U.K. got Libya to give up its WMDs and its nuclear weapons program in December 2003. In addition to making Israel more secure, it also allowed NATO to help overthrow Gaddafi eight years later (in 2011) without the fear of WMDs or nuclear weapons being used against NATO member countries. 




 Can't he try having Israel bomb Iran if he really wanted to do this, though? 




 Well, you could have researched it more. ;) 




  You keep harping about Israel being "threatened"

Actually, I am simply saying what the current Israeli mentality in regards to this is. Personally, though, I agree with you that Iranian nukes almost certainly not mean that Israel is going to be nuked.

when in fact it is Israel that is threatening everyone else with their real, actual, existing nukes,

Who exactly is Israel threatening with their nukes, though?

and furthmore the people who are actually being wiped out are the Palestinians, at the hands of the Israels.

I don't think that the Palestinians are being "wiped out," as you claim. However, I myself certainly support a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict approximately based on the 1967 lines with mutually agreed land swaps. Frankly, it might actually be a good idea for the international community (including the U.S.) to pressure Israel more in regards to this (of course, the Palestinians also have some issues of their own that they will need to deal with before Israeli-Palestinian peace can be made).

The Israeli politicians themselves admitted that the "Iranian threat" is domestically exaggerated for their own purposes.

Yes, and this certainly does not surprise me.

Israel is not the victim.

Agreed, but many Israelis disagree with your view on this. 




 Yes, it did, because it shows that you didn't give enough of a damn to research how exactly her name is spelled. :( 




 Why, though? 




 Actually, the Israel-Lebanon border has been pretty quiet over the last nine years. 




  What a load of crap.

Israel prefers to be safe rather than sorry. I have to admit that it is idiotic for Iran's leadership and/or military to threaten Israel, though. After all, this only feeds the paranoia that many Israelis have in regards to this.

First of all, 40 nations can make nukes quickly right now if they wanted to, so there's nothing special about Iran joining the same club as about 1 out of 4 nations on the planet. http://old.seattletimes.com/html/nationworld/2002041473_nukes21.html
Unlike them, Iran has repeatedly offered to play additional restrictions on its nuclear program, well in excess of what it legally required of Iran but these offers were ignored by the US. IAEA Director ElBaradei noted this himself:

Yes, you are correct in regards to this. However, Iran's threats to Israel is what Israel makes especially concerned about Iran. After all, Israel appears to be cool with Muslim-majority Pakistan having nuclear weapons due to the fact that Pakistan isn't threatening Israel.

Why? Because the US was always using the "Iranian nuclear threat" as simply a pretext to topple the govt there, just like "WMDs in Iraq" had nothing to do with any actual WMDs. Again, IAEA Director ElBaradei:

Actually, I agree with you that Iran might *not* be interested in building actual nuclear weapons right now. Indeed, if our assumption here is accurate, then it would probably be *counterproductive* for Israel to bomb Iran considering that this might actually make Iran determined to build actual nuclear weapons.

Second, Iran is not out to nuke Israel, never was.

I certainly agree with you in regards to this. After all, the Iranian regime's main priority appears to be its own long-term survival. However, Israel wants to reduce this risk to exactly zero.

That was bullshit cooked up by the Israelis because a potential improvement in US-Iran ties risks leaving them out in the cold, so they've been pushing for YEARS to get the US and Iran into a war, just as they did with Iraq.

Maybe, but the statements of Iranian leaders in regards to this certainly haven't been helpful in reducing Israeli paranoia in regards to this:

https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Ali_Khamenei#2000

"Iran's stance has always been clear on this ugly phenomenon (Israel). We have repeatedly said that this cancerous tumor of a state should be removed from the region No one will allow a bunch of thugs, lechers and outcasts from London, America and Moscow to rule over the Palestinians."

In fact, Iran accepted over 100,000 casualities from chemical weapons warfare by US-backed Saddam, and refused to reply in kind on moral grounds though it could have done so legally. So when they say they oppose WMDs, they've proven it with blood. http://cns.miis.edu/archive/cns/programs/dc/briefs/030701.htm

Yes, I agree with you that the Iranian regime probably does have some moral aversion to chemical and nuclear weapons for the reason that you pointed out above. However, as far as I know, the Iranian regime *can* be flexible in regards to this; for instance, I think that then-Iranian President Rafsanjani wanted to build chemical weapons in 1989-1990 in the event that a new Iran-Iraq war would have broken out.

Meanwhile, the only country in the Mideast that actually has nukes is Israel,

Correct (if one does not consider Pakistan to be a part of the Middle East, that is)!

and the only country that is known to have tried to sell nukes to others is Israel.

Yes, Israel tried to sell nukes to the racist Apartheid regime in S Africa

Well, Israel certainly appears to have screwed up in that regard. After all, *no* nuclear weapons-state should sell or give its nuclear weapons to other countries (and Yes, this certainly includes Pakistan, especially in the event that Pakistan tries giving or selling actual nuclear weapons to Saudi Arabia).

This was back when Iran was supporting Nelson Mandela, who had been labelled a "terrorist" by the US -- Mandela later came to Iran and personally thanked them for their staunch support, and refused to join Clinton's sanctions against Iran.

First of all, please let me say that I certainly oppose the Apartheid government which existed in South Africa back then and am glad that it was eventually gotten rid of. However, wasn't Nelson Mandela actually involved in terrorism back then? 




 Bonjour to you, my good man! :) 




 He said that their names are Bruce and Kaitlyn [Caitlyn]. 




 Actually, I myself am currently childless and nevertheless still like the Teletubbies. :) 




 Dude ... that's just fucking awful! :( Please--no awful jokes like that. :( 




 Because I wasn't talking about a personality change here; rather, I was only talking about a species change here. 




 Wouldn't this allow Iran to build nuclear weapons very quickly if it decided to do this, though?

After all, I know that countries such as Japan already have a nuclear weapons capability. 




 Maybe ... maybe. 




 So two of the Teletubbies are transgender? 




 Well, Netanyahu also doesn't want a second Holocaust. After all, many Jews were unfortunately previously caught off-guard when they didn't take Adolf Hitler's 1939 prophecy that European Jewry will be annihilated in the event of another World War seriously. :( 




 So two of the Teletubbies got sex changes? 




 Any thoughts on this? 




 Aren't Po and Laa-Laa females while Dipsy and Tinky-Winky are males, though? If so, then one male and one female have a "stick" on the top of their heads while one other male and one other female have a hole on the top of their heads. 




 What exactly is that supposed to mean, though? 




 Very true. 




 Something which involves me having a vagina, I suppose.

Since I myself have no intention to get a vagina indefinitely, I will never attempt this in reality indefinitely. 




 Any thoughts on this? 




 Oh! OK; understood. 




 If Netanyahu genuinely wants to sabotage this nuclear deal, then he would probably be *much* better off by vehemently arguing in favor of this nuclear deal and frequently saying that this nuclear deal will subdue Iran and put Iran in its place.

If Netanyahu will actually do this, then it might very well make it *much* harder for Iranian "moderates" such as Rouhani and Zarif to get the necessary support for this nuclear deal back home in Iran. 









 Actually, I think that he might ironically be *helping to stabilize* U.S.-Iran relations by making it easier for Iranian "moderates" such as Rouhani and Zarif to "sell" this nuclear deal back home in Iran. After all, they can claim that this nuclear deal is great for Iran due to the fact that Netanyahu (Iran's enemy) strongly opposes it. 




 Redditors can be *extremely* insightful at certain times. This is indeed one of those times. :) 




 On the bright side, though, comments such as these might ironically make it easier for Iranian "moderates" such as Rouhani and Zarif to "sell" this nuclear deal back home in Iran. 




 Well, Yes--Netanyahu is paranoid about Iran. Thus, what exactly would you have expected? 




 Except the hawks, that is. 





























 Yep, and in this regard, legalized gay marriage is technically an expansion of rights for *everyone*.

(P.S.: I myself certainly support legalized gay marriage worldwide.) 




 Grover Cleveland is close behind FDR in regards to his total number of vetoes, though (if one combines Cleveland's first and second non-consecutive terms, that is): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_presidential_vetoes 




 Yep. :) 



















 Also, again, *any* risk of an unplanned pregnancy which is unacceptable for at least some pro-choicers in the hypothetical event of an abortion ban (even if one takes rape out of the equation, though for the record, male-bodied people *can* be victims of rape by female-bodied people) likewise isn't good enough for me either. It really is that simple (even if one ignores all of my gender identity issues). Thus, the choice for me is either castration in a safe, medical setting (after some therapy, obviously) or a "back-alley" castration, and I am pretty sure that any decent person would prefer the former over the latter if these were the only two acceptable options for someone (such as for myself).

Also, Yes, I am certainly well-aware of the difference between pregnancy and child support. However, this only strengthens my own point about risk here considering that a low enough risk should make this difference irrelevant; thus, if this difference is relevant, then the risk of an unplanned pregnancy certainly isn't low enough for me to stop worrying about it. 




  I'm not sure, is it rape if two nine year old kids have sex?
 Or what if it's two 13 year olds? Same issue.

I would say Yes to both of these questions. 




 By that rationale, though, would forcing males whose contraception failed to pay child support for 18/21 years (or possibly even longer than that if it's a severely disabled child) be a punishment for these males? 




 You *are* aware that my proposal here is similar to what Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf previously proposed, correct? 




 I think that you made a double-post here. 




 Understood; that said, though, I still felt compelled to ask this question anyway due to the fact that it is something which has strongly interested me ever since late 2008.

Also, would asking about Shimon Peres winning in 1996 be a better question (in your opinion)? 




 He appears to look *a lot* like Mulan in this self-portrait. ;) 




  Mufaz is not Bibi or Peres, so no.

What exactly makes them meaningfully different from Mofaz, though?

 The fact that you are asking there and not in r/technology for example means you think there will be a difference from their point of view.

This doesn't seem like an appropriate question for r/technology, though.

 To the point, Nobody cares about him or remembers who he is.

Maybe; of course, I still find it interesting that Mofaz almost defeated Livni for the leadership of Kadima back in 2008. 




  My life in Israel TM

OK. ;)

 Mufaz had no supporters outside some Kadima members he brought into the party.

Well, he must have brought a lot of supporters into the party considering that he almost won the 2008 Kadima leadership election.

Under his leadership in 2013 Kadima barely entered the Keneset when before it was the ruling party. That's what happens when the public votes, not just your buddies.

I think that this occurred due to the fact that Mofaz had Kadima enter Netanyahu's coalition in 2012 and then failed to accomplish anything when Kadima was in this coalition, though. If not for that mistake, then Kadima might have done *much* better in the 2013 Knesset elections. 




 I've got a question, though--would it really be in the interest of the Kashmiri Muslims to have Kashmir become a Hindu-majority, non-autonomous part of India rather than to have Kashmir remain a Muslim-majority, autonomous part of India? After all, these would probably be the only two options which I would accept if I myself was an Indian. 




 What exactly are the source and basis for your assertion here, though? 




 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaul_Mofaz 




  I don't, it's just not important.

Are you sure about that, though? Also, by that logic, would Netanyahu's victory over Peres in 1996 likewise be unimportant?

and why are you asking the same question at r/"Palestine" (and everywhere actually)?

Because I want as many people as possible to answer this question.

what is the answer you're looking for?

I am not looking for any specific answer. Rather, I simply want to hear people's thoughts on and responses to this question, whatever these thoughts and responses might be. 




 You forgot about Israel, though. 




  Are those all equally comparable?

Yes, I would think so.

If Palestinians are more easily identifiable and able to return, but poles aren't, does that mean the Palestinians also shouldn't be?

Yes, it does, at least for the time being.

 As well, since you've essentially said it's impossible to do and not going to happen, and therefore shouldn't happen in Palestine, do you then still oppose a referendum in Kashmir? Seeing as the refugees aren't going to return, why shouldn't they just have a referendum with people who are there?

Ah ... I see where exactly you are going with this. Anyway, I will say this--your position on this is certainly not an invalid one. In fact, I am no longer going to outright argue against it. However, if I was an Indian, then I would refuse to agree to a referendum in Kashmir until all of the areas in Kashmir will become Hindu-majority (this might be accomplished by allowing Hindus from other parts of India to buy land in Kashmir, et cetera). However, in such a case, the outcome of this referendum will probably simply be a reconfirmation of the Line of Control as the border between India and Pakistan. 




  Pakistan fought 3 wars with India before they hooked onto the Kashmir issue around 1990.

Weren't two of those three wars about Kashmir, though?

So Kashmir is not the real issue but a symptom of a violent Islamic expansionism that has been going on for more than a millennium.

Actually, I think that it is a bit of both. Both the 1947 Partition itself and the forced migration which resulted from it probably strained Indo-Pakistani relations, as did India's military intervention to ensure Bangladesh's secession from Pakistan in 1971 after Pakistan committed genocide there. However, I *do* think that the Kashmir dispute is a part of the reason for India's and Pakistan's hatred of each other.

 Legally speaking, the entire Kashmir state belongs to India and if that legality is called into question then the existence of Pakistan can also be questioned since both have come into existence from the same Instrument of Accession, which is why Pakistan occupied Kashmir is not included in Pakistan's Constitution and people living in those territories are not Pakistani citizens.

Yes, this appears to be accurate. However, from that perspective, why exactly did India take the Kashmir issue to the United Nations in the first place instead of simply finishing the job militarily in 1949 and kicking Pakistan out of all of Kashmir? (Heck, I think that India even agreed to hold a plebiscite in Kashmir in the late 1940s before changing its mind on this later on).

 The only excuse that Pakistan   other Muslim countries have for Kashmir and Israel is of human rights, democracy   plebiscite etc. but then that can be easily busted by the fact that there is hardly any human rights   democracy in most Muslim majority countries.

Agreed; also, if Pakistan wanted a plebiscite in Kashmir, then it could have already held such a plebiscite on the parts of Kashmir which it already currently controls.

 Plebiscite cannot be conducted in Kashmir because Pakistan has not only changed the original demography of Pak occupied Kashmir but they have also driven out 500,000 Hindus from India's side of Kashmir using state sponsored terrorists.

Agreed.

 Which is why in November 2010, United Nations has excluded Jammu and Kashmir from its annual list of unresolved international disputes under the observation of the United Nations Security Council.

Yes, I think that I have previously heard about that. However, Kashmir is still currently de facto disputed between India and Pakistan.

 So the matter ends there as of now, with the Line of Control being the temporary solution.

Yes; also, though, it is worth noting that my own solution to the Kashmir dispute advocates eventually converting the Line of Control into the permanent international border between India and Pakistan. 




 Yes, I would ideally support a Palestinian right of return along with things such as the right of ethnic Germans and their descendants to return to areas such as Kaliningrad Oblast and the right of ethnic Poles and their descendants to return to the parts of the former Soviet Union from where they or their ancestors were previously expelled. 




  Do you recognize Palestine?

Do I think that there should be an independent Palestinian state approximately based on the 1967 lines? Yes, I do (but with some mutually agreed land swaps).

Just curious.

OK.

And the Palestinian right of return?

As of right now, No, considering that the application of this principle isn't universal. For instance, Russia certainly won't allow the ethnic Germans who were expelled from Kaliningrad or their descendants to move back to Kaliningrad right now.

However, Yes, I do *ideally* support the right of return both in Israel and everywhere else.

Hoping for some consistency.

OK.
 




 Actually, you appear to be forgetting the fact that Mofaz came within several hundred votes of defeating Livni in that 2008 election:

 What exactly would have happened afterwards? How exactly would the history of Israel over the last seven years have been different?

Any thoughts on this?
