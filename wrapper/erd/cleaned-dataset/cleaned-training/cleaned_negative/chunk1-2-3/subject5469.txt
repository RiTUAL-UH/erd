McGILLAN, JOHN M. "SHORTY" - Delirium Tremens - Died Aug 22, 1891 - Age 30 Years  

He Never Blamed the Booze! 

His liver needed scraping and his kidneys had the gout, He swallowed lots of bitters 'til at last he cleaned 'em out, His legs were swelled with dropsy 'til he had to cut his shoes, He blamed it to the doctors, but he never blamed the booze! 

Then he had the tremens, and he tackled rats and snakes, First he had the fever, then he had the shakes, At last he had a funeral and the mourners had the blues, And the epitaph they carved him ..."He Never Blamed the Booze!"

"An advisory alert has been issued for a remote  volcano in the western Aleutian Islands after dozens of earthquakes were reported in the area, an early sign of volcanic unrest. 

The change means that five volcanoes being monitored in Alaska are now simultaneously active, the most in recent memory, said Matt Haney, a research geophysicist at the Alaska Volcano Observatory. "

Too many quakes from Indonesia to the southern Islands, Chile, Acapulco and volcano related swarms in the Aleutians.

 /r/StormComing is simply this: an Archive of Earth Changing Disasters and Events, manmade or natural.

It's not a place for HAARPtards, Climate Change Deniers, Flat-Earthers, or Eschatology/Rapturists to post theorems. And as we want to attract sane, logical redditors, we don't want to hear about how radiation is good for everyone.

This sub is best read using 'new' rather than 'hot' or 'top' as it is an archive of events.

We cover these types of global stories:

* Extreme Weather (including watches/warnings), torrential rains, record breaking wind events, temperatures, tornados, hurricanes, etc.

* Geologic: Landslides, earthquakes, sinkholes, etc.

* Floods and flood watches/warnings.

* Solar: Solar Storms that may have impact on Earth.

* Disease: Disease outbreaks of all kinds, including rabies threats.

* Food Recalls.

* Near Earth Objects: Upcoming close encounters with Meteors.

* Mass animal die-offs.

* Nuclear accidents and events.

* Oil and chemical spills/explosions/fires.

* Wildfires.

* Drought and impacts of drought, ie: agricultural impacts, etc.

If you want to add an Earth-changing or disaster story from the news or reliable source, please do. Since headline writers often fail, feel free to editorialize titles to fill in important details from the story- especially the location.

We have already heard from someone who saw a flash flood forecast here that saved them from swimming home from work. Other redditors have been alerted to Tornado Outbreaks and took safety precautions. So we feel we are fulfilling the purpose of the sub.

As /r/StormComing is an archive of events, there is nothing subjective about it. Downvoting anything here would be as stupid as downvoting an encyclopedia entry.

Feel free to x-post to other reddits, especially reddits that are geographically related to the area the event or warning concerns.

If you mod a related sub I'll be happy to share sidebar links. If you would like to co-mod this sub, send me a pm.

 Over the past year I have been noting rainfall records broken worldwide. People describing these events use the words: torrential, apocalyptic, unusual, extraordinary. I remember an elderly Japanese lady describing one such event (in Japan last year) in this way "The water was coming down so hard I could barely breathe, I felt like I was breathing water."

As stated, I started noting a drastic increase in these events last year- out of past 40 years of serious weather watching. 

[Here is the post I made on it 2013](http://www.reddit.com/r/StormComing/comments/1jzh7q/unheard_of_rains_861388_2013_a_few_samples/).

And here is just the last *7 Days*: 

[Months of Rain Flood Burlington in mere hours](http://www.reddit.com/r/StormComing/comments/2cw4gi/flash_flood_months_of_rain_flood_burlington_in/)

Seven Days; *Eight* extraordinary rain events worldwide. In my experience this is utterly unprecedented. One '500 year' rain event is striking enough in a year. The past 2 years we have had multiple 100 and 500 year rainfalls over just a matter of a month or two.

----------------------

Note from Kolby:

The anomalous movement of the Jet Stream continues to reflect the findings of Jennifer Francis (Rutgers) and her associates. 

In a nutshell: that warming in the Arctic is creating deeper meandering loops in the Jet Stream (Rossby Theory) and that this is *slowing* the Jet Stream, leading to 'stuck' highs and cut off lows. In other words, weather systems that would quickly pass or not be as intense are now intense and longer lasting. For example: two weeks of intense rain instead of an hour or a day. These deeper loops are also pulling in weather systems from deeper south or farther north.

Great little explanatory video: http://youtu.be/_nzwJg4Ebzo

In this case, it is superheated air being pulled up into the UK from Spain by a deep 'loop' in the Jet Stream.

 I have a good friend I have been gaming with for some time. He is an Iraq War Vet who did 6 tours. He cannot work now and lives in a very tiny town. He very much relies on his friendships in Warcraft for companionship and to provide 'something to do every day' in his life. 

His old laptop completely quit a few days ago and he has a HP Pavilion DV6 2057 cl - that he has been trying to get the game downloaded to ever since. He says it just needs a hard drive, but I think it is too old. It keeps giving him an error that states the Javascript cannot be found and another message about the graphics card being out of date.

I desperately want to do something but am in an extremely tight spot, financially. I don't even have a tree this year. 

I am heartsick that he will be spending the holidays 'alone' more or less. I thought about requesting assistance from his online friends- but he is very proud and would be upset if I did so. He needs a hard drive for the HP or even a cheap laptop that is just good enough to run the game. 

Any assistance or advice would be highly appreciated.  Thank you very much in advance.

 So I am dropping this here.

http://www.reddit.com/r/StormComing/comments/2ia6le/disturbing_images_from_dallas_ebola_patients/

To clarify, I posted disturbing images of health officials leaving the Ebola patients apartment in Dallas- making comparisons to recent images. 

I posted to /r/Stormcoming, x-posted to /r/Dallas   /r/texas 

The Stormcoming was immediately upvoted . 

The Dallas and Texas posts were immediately- within minutes of posting- downvoted to oblivion.

This is not something you would expect from regular redditors who want to know what the hell is going on in their areas and would have no reason to want to hide anything. 

Now I see the one on /r/Stormcoming is getting hammered.

Wtf is going on here? 







































 A few days ago- right after the Dallas Ebola patient was diagnosed, [this image was in the news.](http://static2.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1961092.1412271234!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/article_970/ebola.jpg) It shows 'Dallas Health Officials leaving the Ebola patients apartment'. 

([from this news story](http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/80-people-dallas-monitored-ebola-article-1.1960700))

They are in normal business wear. There is no 'clean' station in sight, no hazmat, no gloves, not even shoe booties. You can assume from here they got in their cars and went back to the office, maybe stopping for coffee or lunch along the way; who knows?

Now today we see [this story.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/dallas-ebola-case-spurs-concern-about-hospital-readiness/2014/10/03/4afa10b2-4b30-11e4-a046-120a8a855cca_story.html?tid=pm_national_pop)

Two guys in full hazmat suits, gloves, goggles, wrap and spray down.

Wtf Dallas Health Department? Your two guys could have walked out of that apartment crawling with death. 

























































































 I posted this [before](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheDarkTower/comments/2hhzql/overtake_the_antichrist_at_the_gate_of_lud/) and it got downvoted to oblivion.

I found it fascinating that 'before the gate of Lud' Jesus will kill Satan. This is in Islamic lore. The town is called Lydda now- but the Gate of Lud still stands. I am going to explore more about this today.

But it is sadly ironic that people would try to block others from learning of a really interesting connection. Especially when a clear trend in Kings stories that the characters with blinding, personal dogmas tend to be the true villains.

[My post outlining on the Kristie Baucus/Holly Bobo connection.](http://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/2fxx1l/kristie_moon_disappearance_connection_with_holly/) 























































































































 My pick was Bimble Longberry Jones. Kel'thuzad Kramer is another good one. 





















































































































































 Kristie Baugus Moon was dating Michael Pearcy when she disappeared 10/27/1999. [According to her mother, he was the last one to see her.](http://www.charleyproject.org/cases/m/moon_kristie.html) 

In 2001, Sherrif Ron Wyatt and his partner stopped Michael Pearcy.

["Wyatt and his partner stopped a car driven by Michael Pearcy who was wanted for questioning by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation."](http://www.bpnews.net/4392/bivocational-pastor-recovers-from-roadside-shooting)

Michael Pearcy shot Sherrif Ron Wyatt and Wyatts partner then shot Michael Pearcy to death.

[Michael Pearcy is the son of Mark Pearcy- both Mark and Jeff Pearcy are under arrest for being accessories and accessories after the fact in the Holly Bobo kidnapping and murder.](http://www.wsmv.com/story/26480995/remains-found-in-decatur-co-belonged-to-holly-bobo)

It is difficult to find anything on Kristie Moon. It doesn't look like there were serious searches or investigations held. It's as if no one even wanted to acknowledge her disappearance. This is the exact opposite from the Holly Bobo kidnapping where hundreds of people turned out to search and the police held numerous press conferences.

Here is where it gets strange. Sheriff Wyatt, in three different interviews over the years (all before the Bobo kidnapping), has given three different explanations as to why he pulled over Michael Pearcy. Once for 'bad tail light' and once because Pearcy had been "doing something illegal earlier in the day." The original article states that Wyatt pulled Michael Pearcy over because he was wanted for questioning by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. Which I presumed was over the disappearance of Kristie Moon. 

Now from the Associated press - a statement by Sheriff Wyatt thats a jaw dropper:

["Rita Foley with The Associate Press said that Sheriff Wyatt never expected something like this to happen in the small tight-knit community. He was visibly shaken by the news of Holly's disappearance."](http://www.examiner.com/article/holly-bobo-big-city-crime-comes-to-small-tight-knit-community-safety-tips)

Excuse me? This sheriff was shot by Michael Pearcy, the suspect in the disappearance of Kristie Moon and son of one of the guys busted in the Bobo kidnapping. 

And Sheriff Wyatt acts all surprised, like nothing like this had ever happened in Parsons, Tennessee?

Why did Wyatt give several reasons why he pulled over Michael Pearcy in the first place? Was the TBI investigating Pearcy in Kristies disappearance? It's very hard to dig up any information on this. 

We can't ask Sheriff Wyatts partner- he was killed a few weeks later while investigating a car wreck.

I just know that something stinks to high heaven in Parsons, TN.
