EDIT: [A world map of the measles outbreaks in 2013](http://www.measlesrubellainitiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/mmr_outbreaks_cropped-640x360.png)

Outbreaks are NOT in Central and South America.  




 Yes: "The World Health Organization reported this week that 113 countries, including China, Russia, Iran and Libya, have higher immunization rates than the United States for 1-year-olds."

"data from the World Health Organization shows that measles-vaccination rates in Mexico and Central America are higher than the U.S. rate of 92 percent"

 Compton Rate of Drinking Municipal Water: 93.80% 

Beverly Hills Rate of Buying Bottled Water (that is Actually Municipal Water): 78.33% 




 According to World Health Organization estimates, the U.S. has a measles vaccination rate of 92 percent, while **Mexico and Nicaragua have 99 percent vaccination rates** and Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador each have 93 percent vaccination rates. If anything, those countries should be concerned about Americans coming down to visit.

 Take shells 1 and 2 in your hand, and form them together like a clam shell. Make sure you can grasp with them.

Grab hold of the feces with the shells and pull them out. Continue until all large bits have been removed.

Use shell 3 to scrape (be gentle!) and remove anything you might have missed.

Wash (or flush) the shells, wash your bottom with warm water. 




  when professionals mix their personal advice in with their professional advice

This is their profession. XYZ Healing Arts practitioners offer a wide range of therapies for healing body and mind including: Acupuncture, Chiropractic, Homeopathy, Massage Therapy, Physical Therapy.

I went in for Chiropractic, Massage and Physical Therapy and they did a great job. Thus I just tolerated the homeopathic advice.  




 Since I made the above post, I read other posts and analysis.

The "Memorandum" is not a treaty - it is an agreement.

In the case of aggression, the remedy "if Ukraine should become a victim of *an act of aggression* or *an object of a threat of aggression in which nuclear weapons are used*" is to seek immediate United Nations Security Council action to provide assistance to Ukraine.

Morally I believe the U.S. made a commitment that it needs to keep. 




 If you Google "nightshade foods" you will find many suggestion that they can cause indigestion (and other intestinal issues) and joint pain. Since I was pretty shaken up in the car accident he recommended avoiding nightshades  - at least until my back recovered (which it did - I'm fine now). He did great physical therapy work, so I politely tolerated his homeopathy suggestions.  




  translation into different languages

If you want a real answer, I would suggest calling a librarian. They are amazing with topics like this, and they generally love the chance to answer questions like this.  




 Nightshade also includes eggplant and tobacco. I had a physical therapist (after an auto accident) tell me to avoid all nightshades. F*** that - I love them all way too much. 




 I don't know, but I'm guessing there are many translations.

You can get free e-book versions since it's in the public domain. 




 The "Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances" is a diplomatic memorandum signed in December 1994 by Ukraine, Russia, the United States, and the United Kingdom under which signatories made promises to each other as part of the denuclearization of former Soviet republics after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Ukraine promised to remove all nuclear weapons, and kept this promise.

In return, Russia and the Western signatory countries essentially consecrated the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine as an independent state. In the "Budapest Memorandum," Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States promised that none of them would ever threaten or use force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine. They also pledged that none of them would ever use economic coercion to subordinate Ukraine to their own interest. They also pledged to protect Ukraine if its security was threatened.  




 Meat with nightshade - a Shakespearean pizza  




 When post-Cold War Ukraine gained independence, it held the worlds third-largest stockpile of nuclear weapons. Rather than use nukes for protection, Ukraine sought and received assurances from the international community that its borders would be respected if it gave up its nuclear weapons. In 1994, the U.S., United Kingdom and Russia signed the Budapest Memorandum, in which **all sides pledged to respect Ukraines territorial integrity, refrain from using military force or economic pressure to limit Ukrainian sovereignty and provide assistance to Ukraine if it became the victim of aggression from another nation**.

Obviously, Russia has broken its part of that agreement. Now the question is whether the US will break theirs.

**If the U.S. breaks their word, they should consider the devastating impact on American counter proliferation efforts around the world**. How could any nation ever trust U.S. security assurances if they see, in the carnage and destruction in Ukraine, **the deadly folly of trading nuclear weapons for American guarantees**?

After being unable to save two hostages held by Middle Eastern extremists, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said constitutional change will be needed to protect the lives and assets of Japanese citizens.

Abe has said at times that with the current interpretation of Article 9, which forbids both the use of force to settle international disputes and the maintenance of regular armed forces, it is difficult to protect Japanese citizens in a changing security environment.

The Liberal Democratic Party has already presented a draft amendment to Article 9, and amending it is to carry out our duty of protecting the lives and assets of Japanese citizens, Abe told the Upper House Budget Committee on Tuesday.

 A recent study showed that it is natural for nostrils to have differing air intake volumes under normal conditions. The findings suggest this aids in identification of scents, as the reactions occur differently at a higher volume and an lower volume.

Edit: [Nature.com Article](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v402/n6757/full/402035a0.html)

"The flow of air is greater into one nostril than into the other because there is a slight turbinate swelling in one. The nostril that takes in more air switches from the left to the right one and back again every few hours, but the effect of this switching on the sense of smell has been unclear. Here we show that this difference in airflow between the nostrils causes each nostril to be optimally sensitized to different odorants, so that each nostril conveys a slightly different olfactory image to the brain."

 Just the opposite. "Texas seceded from the United States in 1861, and joined the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. It replaced the pro-Union governor, Sam Houston, in the process. During the war, slavery in Texas was little affected, and prices for slaves remained high until the last few months of the war. The number of slaves in the state increased dramatically as the Union Army occupied parts of Arkansas and Louisiana. Slaveholders in those areas often moved their slaves to Texas to avoid having them emancipated. By 1865 there were an estimated 250,000 slaves in Texas."

 "Doxing" is a neologism that has evolved over its brief history.

Essentially, doxing is revealing and releasing records of an individual, which were previously private, to the public.

 Kenebrew is represented by civil rights attorney Hank Sherrod, who last year represented Robert Bryant of Kelso, Tennessee.

Sherrod argued that Madison County deputies in the summer of 2012 conspired to stalk, beat and falsely arrest Bryant. Bryant sued Sheriff Dorning and eight deputies, including Countess, in federal court last year.

The county settled with Bryant for $625,000 last year and the FBI then announced it was investigating the deputies.

This lawsuit invokes the Bryant case and related newspaper articles to argue that Dorning and the Madison County Sheriff's Department have a record of ignoring or even covering up police misconduct.

"Deputies under [Sheriff] Dorning's command have learned that their justifications for using force and other unlawful actions will never be questioned," reads the Kenebrew suit, "and that they can act with impunity."

 There are 10 of these disturbing fairy tales in the article.

**Sleeping Beauty** - In one of the very earliest versions of this classic story, published in 1634 by Giambattista Basile as Sun, Moon, and Talia, the princess does not prick her finger on a spindle, but rather gets a sliver of flax stuck under her fingernail. She falls down, apparently dead, but her father cannot face the idea of losing her, so he lays her body on a bed in one of his estates. Later, a king out hunting in the woods finds her, and since he cant wake her up, rapes her while shes unconscious, then heads home to his own country. Some time after that, still unconscious, she gives birth to two children, and one of them accidentally sucks the splinter out of her finger, so she wakes up. The king who raped her is already married, but he burns his wife alive so he and Talia can be together. Dont worry, the wife tries to kill and eat the babies first, so its all morally sound.

  according to the CDC 86 cases of measles were reported in the year 2000. ... The whole measles thing by itself is a joke and not a real threat to America.

[From January 1 to January 30, 2015, 102 people from 14 states were reported to have measles](http://www.cdc.gov/measles/cases-outbreaks.html)
"The United States experienced a record number of measles cases **during 2014, with 644 cases from 27 states reported to CDC**'s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD). This is the greatest number of cases since measles elimination was documented in the U.S. in 2000."

* The majority of the people who got measles were unvaccinated.
* Measles is still common in many parts of the world including countries in Europe, Asia, the Pacific, and Africa.
* Travelers with measles continue to bring the disease into the U.S.
* Measles can spread when it reaches a community in the U.S. where groups of people are unvaccinated.

 Did you look at the [World Map of the measles outbreaks in 2013](http://www.measlesrubellainitiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/mmr_outbreaks_cropped-640x360.png)?

It's not about skin color - it's about geography.  




 No - the contagion vectors come from outside the Americas.

The spread is due to pools of non-immunized children that are exposed and quickly transmit it to others.

If the children were immunized, the virus brought in from Europe or Africa would not spread.  




 Here's some of the misinformation being spread: 

**Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.)** said individuals who come to the U.S. illegally may be responsible for the recent measles outbreak, contending they dont undergo the stringent health screening others do when they enter the country. I dont think there is any health care professional who has examined the facts who could honestly say that Americans have not died because the disease is brought into America by illegal aliens who are not properly health care screened as lawful immigrants are.

**Rush Limbaugh** - The children coming across the southern U.S. border "were never examined after they got here and quarantined if they had a disease. They were just sent out across the country. Many of them had measles ... We now have an outbreak of it all because of our immigration policy."
 









 Curry, Yes - if the execution is within a few hours of the meal, then **bring it on hot and spicy**.

A) Execution goes as scheduled - so **no "curry bum" to worry about**

B) Stay of execution - **the happiest I've ever been to have red hot curry shits** 




 The most deadly animal in the world is the mosquito. It might seem impossible that something so minuscule can kill so many people, but mosquito bites result in the deaths of more than 1 million people every year.

 This study had several limitations. 

First, we did not have adequate numbers to examine suicide trends in some specific subgroups 

Second, changes in cause of death coding might have affected our findings, 

Third, the study was not designed to determine whether changes in suicide rates in black and white children corresponded to periods of change in risk factors for suicide. 

Fourth, it is **unknown whether the accuracy of classification of a death as suicide in children has changed during the study**

  What other animals have exposed skin?

 I found this, not sure if it's true ...

"A Hammerhead Shark was the first shark known to demonstrate asexual reproduction (where a female produced young without the input of a male). In addition, they are one of the few animals, along with pigs and human beings, that can suntan as their skin becomes darker with increased exposure to harmful rays when swimming close to the waters surface."

 If you are only married 6 years, I believe there *usually* is not alimony (depends on which state). If you were married 10+ years then absolutely. 

If you have a child then absolutely to child support regardless of length of relationship (or even if you were married or not).

 **Tater Tots** - those were always the best! 




 A piece of good dark chocolate.  




 The purpose of the student loan is to provide future benefit (the fruits of the education). Since the ex-spouse will not be able to participate in the future benefit, both statues and court rulings state that, in general, student loans within a marriage are individual debts, not joint debts. There are exceptions, but that is the rule.

Example: If my wife puts me through medical school with $250,000 in student loans, then after 6 years of marriage I divorce her, she does NOT have to pay any of the loans since they will only benefit me - - via future income. 




 I feel a little guilty saying this, but in the grand scheme of things, the loss of our planet's cultural heritage, history, and sites such is this makes me at least as angry as the loss of life.

**Destruction of cultural heritege should be a war crime**. 




 If you watch it in reverse, it's a snail blowing a bubble.  




 THAT - that I have to try! 




 If you are married almost all debts are joint - regardless if the spouse co-signed.

Student loans are one of the few debts that aren't joint within a marriage.  




 Without my knowledge my wife (now Ex) took out $75k in student loans, then filed for divorce.

She honestly thought I would have to pay them.

She took out another $25K+ during the separation and tried to get me to pay that as well.

Oh yah . . . her "degree" is in Children's Literature. Good luck paying of that $100K loan! 




 It sure beats being "torn apart by ravenous dogs".

 Images released by the U.S. Committee for Human Rights in North Korea this week appears to show several individuals standing in front of anti-aircraft machine guns at a military training area 13 miles north of Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, around Oct. 7, 2014.

It appears that these people are being executed.

"Images released by the U.S. Committee for Human Rights in North Korea this week appears to show several individuals standing in front of anti-aircraft machine guns at a military training area 13 miles north of Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, around  Oct. 7, 2014.

It appears, though it cannot be confirmed, that these people are being executed." 









 I don't think so. If that were the case, you would commit a crime if:

I email you child porn as an attachment (the image would be on your PC)

I sneak onto your PC and download the file "train_subject5937 Child Porn" that contains illegal images.

In both cases, the illegal child porn is on your PC, but you have no intent and have not committed a crime - - but I would have. 




 The intent and the individual's actions are very different in the two cases.

1. If Googling "impact of child porn on society" resulted in images being cached, it would be hard to prove intent to download the illegal porn.

2. If in addition, you right click on the child porn and "save image as", then you have clear intent. 




  if you search for it and you see the image hosted on a website 

The Google Search would be within your browser (not actually going to another website). Now, if the browser caches the images to your hard drive, and they remain there, that might be a gray area if a search of your PC was done and they were found. I think you could beat the charges since, by doing a Google search with your browser, you did not intend to, and did not actively download the pictures. 

Source: I'm not a lawyer, but I play one on the Internets.  




  only if you find some

I don't think finding child porn would be illegal. DOWNLOADING it would be illegal. Thus, the search would not be a crime, the act of downloading it would.

(Source - I live in the SF bay area. Talk radio man Bernie Ward went to prison for his child porn "research". He downloaded.) 




 It's tough work finding that path - - keep trying. And creating a budget (and following it) helps. 

A strict budget is the only way I could have made it through college with almost no debt.

I wish you the best of luck.

 Then work hard to either decrease expenses, or increase income (or both) so you can create a larger cushion. 

I'm not trying to bust your balls, but seriously, the security of creating (1) a safety net and (2) savings for the future, will reduce stress and make life much more enjoyable.  




 I think there is a distinction between being a crime, and supporting criminal charges.

1. Clearly a search could be evidence in support of criminal charges (e.g. "how to dissolve a body with lye")

2. Under the Patriot Act, repeated searches on the President's travel plans, combined with searches to hire an assassin, etc. might be prosecutable.  

Other than the Patriot Act or threats on the President, I have a hard time seeing when a search, or even a pattern of searches would be a crime. 




 U.S. News and the Internet site Beliefnet funded a poll to learn more about why, how, where and when people pray. Here is a summary of the findings: 

 75% percent were Christian. 

 64% say they pray more than once a day.

 56% say they most often pray for family members, with 3.3% saying that they pray for strangers.

 A little over 38% say that the most important purpose of prayer is intimacy with God.

 41% say that their prayers are answered often.

 1.5% say that their prayers are never answered.

 Over 73% say when their prayers are not answered, the most important reason is because they did not fit Gods plan.

 5% say that they pray most often in a house of worship.

 79% say that they pray most often at home.

 67% say that in the past six months, their prayers have related to continually giving thanks to God. (Pastors Weekly Briefing, 12/24/04)
 




  Blessings require some work or effort on our part before we can obtain them. Prayer is a form of work and is an appointed means for obtaining the highest of all blessings.
