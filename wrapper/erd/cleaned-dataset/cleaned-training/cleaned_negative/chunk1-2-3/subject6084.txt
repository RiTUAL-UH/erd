VERY late in life (age 88 by my reckoning) she said she wanted to die in London and moved to an expensive hotel in Piccadilly. She ran out of money, though, but the hotel didn't want to kick her out. Prince Charles started footing the bill. She had her own stool at the hotel bar, where during her nineties she would have at least 6 gin and tonics a day. Good for her, I say. She died in 2011 at age 98.

 Indeed. Interestingly, these plants still possess a chloroplast genome, which has been sequenced. Since chloroplasts are responsible for photosynthesis, you would think that in this species, which has literally never seen the light of day, the chloroplast genome would have been lost over time. However, Rhizanthalla still retains a tiny number (37) of genes in its plastid genome, suggesting that chloroplasts have functions beyond that of photosynthesis.

 It's a good point, perhaps the phrase "transcription factor *recognition* site" should have been used, as is done in the abstract of the article, instead of "binding site". However I am not familiar with the distinction between the two. 




 That abstract is from an accompanying perspective article. The abstract of the actual paper in question is here:

 Exonic Transcription Factor Binding Directs Codon Choice and Affects Protein Evolution

 Genomes contain both a genetic code specifying amino acids and a regulatory code specifying transcription factor (TF) recognition sequences. We used genomic deoxyribonuclease I footprinting to map nucleotide resolution TF occupancy across the human exome in 81 diverse cell types. We found that ~15% of human codons are dual-use codons (duons) that simultaneously specify both amino acids and TF recognition sites. Duons are highly conserved and have shaped protein evolution, and TF-imposed constraint appears to be a major driver of codon usage bias. Conversely, the regulatory code has been selectively depleted of TFs that recognize stop codons. More than 17% of single-nucleotide variants within duons directly alter TF binding. Pervasive dual encoding of amino acid and regulatory information appears to be a fundamental feature of genome evolution.
 




 It does. The research article is [here](https://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6164/1367.full) and says that [codons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code), the three-letter codes in our DNA that stand for an amino acid in protein synthesis, can **simultaneously** code for an amino acid **and** a transcription factor binding site. [Transcription factors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor) control the expression of genes, i.e. turning them on or off. These dual-use codons, or "duons" as they have called them, represent the "second code" that OP's article is talking about. Even though I only just read it, it looks like a big deal. 




 Yes, and it seems that codon bias - the observed preference of some redundant codons over others - may be explained by these "duons", which would be one of the major findings of this paper from a molecular evolution angle. From the abstract:

 Duons are highly conserved and have shaped protein evolution, and TF-imposed constraint appears to be a major driver of codon usage bias.  




 The research article is [here](https://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6164/1367.full). As mentioned in OP's link, it seems that some codons (of which there are 64 in the standard [genetic code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code)), can simultaneously encode an amino acid and a transcription factor binding site. [Transcription factors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor), put very crudely, control how genes are turned on or off. The discovery of these codons with dual use, hence the term "duons", is very interesting.

 Yes DNA is still fragmented and assembled with PacBio's own proprietary assembly software HGAP. The advantage of SMRT is much longer read lengths (thousands of bases) compared to Illumina for example (50-150 bases). Despite the lower base calling accuracy of SMRT (although I hear the accuracy is getting better all the time) the longer read length helps with assembly greatly, and I can say from personal experience that this gives some *very* promising preliminary results for genome sequencing. 




 For clarity, it should be also noted that these technologies are just different ways of sequencing sequence fragments. No matter how long they are, especially for SMRT, they still need to be computationally assembled to recover an entire chromosome, for instance. Until someone can rapidly sequence an entire chromosome linearly from start to end, it is still "shotgun sequencing". 




 OK, perhaps in the future, but there's no way these technologies are routinely used for genome sequencing now, especially novel genomes, which was my initial point. 




 Huh? All next generation sequencing technologies sequence short random fragments of a larger DNA (or RNA, now) molecule, which are then assembled in silico to recover the larger sequence they came from. This is the essence of shotgun sequencing. 




 OP's link is explicitly about the project resulting in the first draft human genome, which finished in 2000. The X prize didn't start until 2006. 




 This is partly due to competition from Celera Genomics, Craig Venter's private company, whose improved method, shotgun sequencing, is now routinely used for genome sequencing. This article doesn't seem to mention this at all.
