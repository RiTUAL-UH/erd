 planning on doing beef and cheddar next, cheers man, thanks! 




 this was a natural hog casing, I bought a small tub if it from a local butcher, comes packed in salt, all I had to do was soak it for about 15 minutes and then run water through it, it's very resilient! 




 very nice actually, big difference was texture and how much better it was to store bought sausage 
























 perfect, heading there next wednesday, I'll take you up on that advice, cheers! 




 will go back, have to do the other west coast teams, so i will definitely get a better pic, cheers!
