 Is this true?  If yes, one of the most horrifying images I've ever seen. 




 I'll be interested in informed responses to this question, but I've read that Oscar Wilde could read two pages at a time, one with each eye.  




 Thank you for your comment and sincere apologies if I am incorrect.  

Please read the artist's statement: 
"With "Tears of Nanjing" I want to show my deepest sympathy and love for all those totally innocent people who were perished so unjustifiably and with outmost cruelty, but also I want to remind the Japanese leaders that as long as they do not want to face the history, humanity cannot and will not possibly forgive and forget". (Gene Emerson) 









 Pavel Lisitsian. 




 One of my favorite operas, Ariadne auf Naxos by Strauss!

 In fact, R-K's opera fueled the "Salieri poisoned Mozart" rumor, inspiring Shaffer's play. 




 Aloe gel, let it dry. Then try some coconut oil or olive oil and let it soak in. 




 The first performance of the 4 Last Songs occurred after Strauss' death.  He wrote these most beautiful songs with Kirsten Flagstad's voice in mind, and she premiered the songs with Furtwngler in 1952. Many critics consider their live collaboration to be the finest of all recorded performances of these songs.  Unfortunately, the sound quality is wretched, but one can hear the magnificent interpretation in spite of the poor sound.  
Thank you brocket66 for this post.  4 Last Songs are the ultimate, final flowering of the German Romantic tradition. 




 Abendempfindung by Mozart (try Schwarkopf).  Too many to count by Schubert, but try Gretchen am Spinnrade, Erlknig, An Sylvia, Die Taubenpost, Litanei aus dem Fest, Nacht und Trume, and so many more (he wrote over 600.) Many Russian romances by Tchaikovsky, including Amid the din of the ball, None but the lonely hearts, Why, The fires in the room were dying out.  Richard Strauss' Four last songs. 


































 His atavistic position on abortion, which should be a fundamental right for all women. Please allow me to remind you of the right's incessant attacks on women's bodies.  Yes, he's a 'libertarian' but his positions on women are extreme right. 




 I'm sorry, I don't understand your comment. 




 One year of mourning her father. 




 I'd have to search for the source (and can try if anyone is interested), but I recall that there is a tradition from Shakespeare and/or classical comedy, of having the characters group together in a happy ending.   




 Bernie over anyone.  Rand hates women. 









 He gives new meaning to the phrase 'cheesehead'.   




 Marital rape is still legal in India, and violence against women is horribly prevalent on a global level.  In Russia, before the revolution, it was common for the landowners (serf/slave owners) and the rich to sexually exploit serfs with no consequences.  Just read about Tchaikovsky's relationship with his servant. 
 
I would like to add that on reddit, in the comments, I observe so  much disrespect and violent thoughts directed at women that it is repulsive. 




 Not to mention appalling grammar and diction. 




 I've observed a fashion for Americans to intentionally americanize foreign names, saying it's "pretentious" to pronounce them appropriately.  How sad. 









 Great!  I was unaware of thorium's potential as an energy source.   
























 He's stupid, he's short, he's ugly.  He will not do well in primaries.  Americans don't like short and ugly although they tolerate stupid to a frightening degree.  Wisconsinites do seem to favor ignorant dropouts, though.  Rep. Reid Ribble is a bible school dropout and Walker just couldn't cut it in college.  These men have no education, no brains, and no morals. They are Koch brother whores.  









 Walker is the puppet of the Koch brothers who are using Wisconsin as the testing ground state for their world/nation destroying policies. 




 One of my favorite Mozart compositions.  Also love Pollini and Bhm in K.488. 




 Vier letzte Lieder - 4 Last Songs.  There are many great recordings:
Anneliese Rothenberger, Andr Previn https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n77jQCrjA6M
Martina Arroyo, Gnter Wand https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0epM71y1l8M
Olga Peretyatko, Dmitri Bliss https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QvFynvO7yc
 




 The live broadcasts of Tristan with Flagstad and Melchior at the Met, from 1935 to 1941, are the most brilliantly sung, imo.  Also immortal are the live Beecham and Reiner recordings from 1936 and 1937. 
 
There are some phenomenally sung/conducted Meistersingers from Knappertsbusch (3 available) and a studio recording from Kubelik with Sandor Konya's gorgeous, Italianate Walther and Gundala Janowitz's luminous Eva.  

The 1955 live stereo Ring from Keilberth at Bayreuth is first rate.  It was suppressed until recently because of preferential treatment of Solti's studio recording (with less excellent singing, imo).  I actually like the Keilberth 1953 Ring even better.  

There is a live Tannhuser from Leinsdorf with Melchior and Flagstad that is one of the greatest live opera recordings I've ever heard.

I prefer Golden Age Wagnerian singing/conducting. Many of these recordings are available on YouTube. 




 Ljuba Welitsch's Salome was unforgettable.  Here she is with Fritz Reiner and Hans Hotter, one of the greatest Wotans.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SJMlNDFS0Q
She recorded the final scene with Reiner in 1949 - hair raising: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BReBIkkExM 









 All the more reason to condemn him and call him out on his repressive, backward attitude. 




 Rand Paul is anti-abortion. Period.   




 It's called the lieto  fine, a tradition in opera buffa to conclude with a joyful ending. 




 Whatever he calls himself, his position on women's rights is wrong.
