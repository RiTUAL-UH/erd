 What region is it for, NA or EU? 




 There once used to be a super monster known as Kali, when she went jungling and got all three buffs she would be invulnerable. 




 Neith rank 9, going to be first to ten :D 




 Just send me a message over reddit or add me IGN: train_subject8459 and we can talk. 




 Neith being my favorite god, I would love this. 




 I would love the Kali skin because I'd love to have a convention skin and also because It's one of the only good Kali skins. 




 I honestly would love to see a 2v2 tournament because I only have 1 friend who I really play with, it really sucks that I want to enter but I don't have a team, mainly because of timezone issues so people I do add are all on different times. 




 Haha the trading in Civ 5 is fucked, I offered the Celts everything I had for a defensive pact, they said no :/

 that would be great for a me, being a bandit, i would paint "Friendly inside!" take them hostage then have some fun and then let them go after ransacking them. 




 Thanks for the responses on this great help, now i know how to get more cats :D. Thanks guys, you were a big help. 




 does anybody know how to get cats would love some feedback, thanks. 




 what game is the review for?
 




 I would really love to see a Neith background, one of my favorite gods 




 HALF-LIFE 3 CONFIRMED  




 Nice wallpaper, not too big a fan of Thor but it's still very nice 




 I agree, the art also doesn't bother me too much but I would like new items.
 




 sadly i also didnt either like alot of people, but we did all say merry christmas and people were quite cheerful, that made my day :) 




 Excellent photo continue to make more and have a Merry Christmas 
























 Thought had a question mark next to it :/ but yeah he seems to go in and out, I think he would be just out of the warriors but not really overall in the supports. 




 Guardians ~ Khumbhakarna, Geb and Athena

Warriors ~ Hercules and Sun Wukong

But I mainly just like the Guardians, not a big fan of warriors for support
 




 They said on a reddit post that you won't be able to obtain it until after odyssey since that way you would be able to get the skins for 200 gems instead of 600 gems.

Edit - Link 




 Mine was stuck there for a few minutes around 7 minutes ago or so, but after a while it started to go up again, so for me all I had to do was wait. 




 I just tend to sit there searching the Smite reddit... like most other people 




 I love when people are actually friendly and a lot of fun can come from it, wish I was in that game with you sounded awesome. 




 Support Apollo 




 As soon as I saw this I thought of the custom W3 maps too, could be good for inspiration. 




 It does seem to be that way, all of the players I've used it with have been friendly and it really helps improve your teamwork, the only downside is when you go to chat and only one other person has it. 




 His 3 (Grasping Hands) already gives a slow 




 I had that problem, we fixed it by remaking the party 




 Who's the god to the right of you (With gold skin)? xD 




 Which do you think is your favourite god as support. 




 Can look at stats here https://account.hirezstudios.com/smitegame/stats.aspx 




 Your job is to try and help teammates, whether it's bodyblocking basics to save them, or using abilities to help them. Another job of yours is to set up kills for people and try to help them obtain kills. On top of this, you must ward all around, steal objectives with hand of the gods rank 3 and rotate all around helping other lanes and taking mid camps. 




 Does anybody know if you get a total of 150 gems, or does it stack each time so you get a total of 600? 




 Done and done 




 Might be able to get a copy for you, I'll post again if I do so to stop multiple attempts
 
























 Whilst it is a good thought, I find that it's just such a waste of water. 




 You can also find it easier to play with a friend and have them if they video, choose somebody who you'll talk with and will help you lighten up and not feel too nervous. 




 If that happened in rank.. no no, but the reason Apollo can support is the protections he gains from his mez (in case you were wondering). Also, you need to try two junglers, just get somebody who can play safely on ADC and maybe have them play Neith. 




 Whilst it is a good idea in thought, in theory it would fail as somebody could always just leave an obvious loss just so that the team doesn't suffer as big a TP loss. 




 Not to be rude or anything, but I could not understand what that meant. 




 Well good guy Greg, have you seen... support Apollo?! 




 Heyo 




 The best/main way to join a professional team is to play league and get to somewhere such as masters and get people to notice you. Good luck on your quest to make it big. 




 Each god has a Gold ~ God Rank 1, Legendary ~ God Rank 5 and recently added in the Cabrakan update Diamond ~ God Rank 10 skins. 




 Another piece of advice is actives, while beads can be really good, on a support it would be wiser to get something that helps your team, e.g. heavenly agility, shell or creeping curse. And would be nice to get a reply for feedback but can't since it is only for ranked, but looking at your stats you didn't seem to have done bad. If you have any questions feel free to PM me. 




 Before the Cabrakan update in which it fixed itself, I couldn't hear any gods taunts, jokes or laughs. Can you hear any of them for other gods? 




 Exactly, I'm getting sick of players who just want a snowball game, who cares if you're down eg 10 kills, if you work together and try you could actually bring it back instead of surrendering. 




 That seems about right 




 I play a fair amount of conquest and these all seem normal picks to me but I can still run Neith solo, Ra mid/solo, (Can't jungle). What servers do you play on, NA or EU? 




 Keep in mind, this way also helps encourage the support when to ward, generally you should make sure the area is clear before putting down a sentry to clear another in case this happens^^ but as somebody who mains support, it does get annoying being unable to rotate to a fight because that ability was used for a ward. 




 When I get a Geb shield on at the last second saving them with the smallest amount of health and they escape (although it generally inspires people to run back in *sigh*) 




 P S with Garterbelt is an awesome series... if only they made season 2 




 Hoping for a Neith skin
