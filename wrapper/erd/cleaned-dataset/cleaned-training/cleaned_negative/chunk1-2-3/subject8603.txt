 Agreed. I ordered a sample off their website and couldn't make it through more then a few bottles of water before I had a splitting headache. Red 40 will do that to you.  




 Yup. Some places I've gone to add some mint to the sauce, but I really don't like the taste of mint outside gum and some mixed alcohols.

 Thanks for pointing that out. I've been using the Spotify app in that shitty emulated phone view for weeks. 




 I lived in Japan for 15 years before moving to America. This really takes me back. Thanks for making it. 




 If you're willing to pay about $1 a month, you can download Paper Mache which lets you use Instapaper to download pages for offline viewing.  




 It's gotten incredibly common lately and should be easily found at any grocery store. But if for some reason you can't find any, you can buy regular plain yogurt and strain it with some cheese cloth and get the same result. 









 They're referred to as husband and wife. I don't know if there was a marriage ceremony between a real cow and bull, but symobically they are married.  









 I guess I'll be going with the free option. I've done a lot of the recommendations off HP's support forums to no avail. Was there a specific number you had to call for Touchpad support or was it just the HP support number? 




 Man. What a pain. I guess I'll just have to deal with having to carry headphones along with me wherever I go. Thanks for the info. 




 This is really annoying. The left speaker went out the day after I bought it but I just dealt with it since the right speaker was plenty loud enough for what I needed it for. Now my right speaker is out for some inexplicable reason. It had been working earlier in the day, but when I got home from work, the speaker had just stopped putting out sound. The sound works fine if I plug in headphones, but is a pain. Has anyone else had this problem and maybe fixed it themselves, or am I going to have to get in touch with HP Support in the hopes that they can either fix it or send me a replacement.  




 Tell me about it. I ordered 2 of them for my family and had them send me their money so I could mod and ship it to them. Now I have to keep my eye out for future sales so that I don't feel like I ripped them off. Still salty about the whole thing, but whatever. Good luck on future snagging one in the future though! Hopefully its not a repeat of this debacle.

*edit*
Nevermind, apparently OnSale is just a shitty vendor that doesn't know how to limit their sales to their limited inventory. 




 Interested, but why is it called a FB454UT Smartbuy TouchPad? 




 Pretty weaboo, but I have yet to find anything that can replace [this.](http://i.imgur.com/hEgti.jpg)

 I was literally JUST thinking about making this comic. Made [this](http://i.imgur.com/PVxdX.jpg) earlier today before I even read your post. I start off by boiling about 1/2 a cup of water, adding only about 3 tbsp of natural peanut butter and adding garlic powder, sesame oil, soy sauce, and Sriracha, and when I'm feeling a little cheery, a bit of vodka. Its so god damn delicious. 




 Awesome! Totally worked this time. You are a god amongst men. 




 Not working D: 




 Oh god,  definitely. My roommate's girlfriend tried using it like any other cooking oil and she almost burned down our apartment. The smell was awful.  




 I use it in tons of different Asian style recipes. It's great for quickly adding a nutty sesame flavor, and is quite potent in a few drops. I also use it a lot for when I marinate stuff. 

Quick dipping sauce recipe for pot stickers and dumplings 
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 1/4 cup water
- few drops of sesame oil
- 1tsp of brown sugar 




 Definitely use a natural peanut butter over the kiddy sugary kind. I probably should edit that.  




 If you got it, by all means use it. The recipe works either way.  




 A few days covered in the fridge. Keep it in some tupperware and it should last you a week or so. If you make a really good batch, it shouldn't have to last that long ;D 




 Try some roasted red pepper. Maybe even throw in some sriracha. 




 My local grocery store's cheapest can of tahini is exorbitantly expensive at about $15 (even with a pretty good Arabic population) and might not be as easily found in some places. I also went through the supply I did buy rather quickly. It could be found online for pretty cheap, so I might just do that in the future and revise this recipe, but for now, this is a quick and dirty way to get hummus without having to pay too much for it at the grocery store. Its also far and away a better alternative then most recipes I see that don't use tahini. 




 I used unmixed, unsweetened peanut butter in this recipe. Using something like Jif or Peter Pan adds a little more sweetness, but I wouldn't go out of my way to add sugar to the hummus.  




 Its a pretty good approximation, especially if you use something similar to Naturally More peanut butter where you have to mix in the oils before you eat it. Something premixed like Jif or Peter Pan is going to have a lot more sugar and probably make your hummus sweeter, but not so much that its inedible. 




 I haven't tried it without. It might be totally fine, but that's how I've been making it and I think its supposed to add a nutty flavor. If you're allergic to peanuts, it might be worth seeking out actual tahini, but from experience, it does come at a premium. 





























 I would like some of these as prints to put on my wall.

 Every time I am expected to be anywhere near a pool I tied up my phone in a condom. Its not pretty but better to spend the 75 rather then the couple hundred bucks for a new phone.

 I went from 260 to 215 and noticed a lot of the same things you're describing. I still find it hard to keep social interactions interesting for the other party because of the high level of cynicism that developed as part of being fat, but I'm working on improving my outlook on life and have started letting people in without feeling so shitty about myself. :D
