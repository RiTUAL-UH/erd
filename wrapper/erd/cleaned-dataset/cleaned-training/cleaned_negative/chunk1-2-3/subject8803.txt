 When pressed you jump back to the last thing happened: a building or unit that just finished, or when you get attacked.
Its not super super vital, but comes in handy sometimes. 




 Dat Thorzain smirk in the background  









 Lagging as hell for me too (EU), almost unwatchable. 




 So sad i am not able to play this qualifier, next one i will be attending for sure!

 SC2 HOTS! 




 Cmon guys, this impersonator deserves an audience! 




 Anyone up for making a platinum/diamond team? I am really lacking practice partners, or a decent place to find a few.. 




 Pretty known for sc2 players: try google "zerg rush" and get that korean APM!

 All i can say is: Thank you dApollo for your awesome tutorials! 
























 Its kinda lame they re-used so many stuff from the other trailer.

Still hyped though! 




 Well, that is the least touched game on my desktop i think, and i have only played a few PvP's. So i can't really tell if it's pay to win. 

It's pretty fun though, but i prefer the old aoe (:

 AHWWWW man, I LOVE SC2!!! 




 This series is soooo nerve wrecking 0__o

 Darn, missed it, can i watch a vod somewhere? (:
EDIT: already found it, thank you for casting that! hope you liked it (:

 Submitted mine!  




 This is from quite a while ago, and it is embarrasing to watch for me now, but i think this was the closest game in my still short SC2 career, hope you like it (:

 Ik ben sowieso aanwezig! Zin in! 




 I dont know if this was already posted on here, but Totalbiscuit made quite an interesting [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uwAo8lcAC4) about this topic. 




 the two best analitical casters out there, woohoo! I also like the choice for Take as host. And geoff just always makes me laugh. Man, this tourney is gonna be awesome! 




 Are there any pictures of the whole thing out of the water?

 parting's multitasking was so incredible throughout the whole mid   lategame!! 




 Oh wow, i listened many many times to this song, but never saw this vid, thanks! 









 Wow, this just hits the nail on the head. Everyone is always talking about how the mainstream music becomes worse and worse, but this just proves it.
