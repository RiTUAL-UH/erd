 Fartney 2012 




 I watched the IGN review of Halo 4, and never have I ever seen such incredible amounts of ass kissing in my life. The reviewer was literally embarrassing to listen to because he acted like he was blown away and was about as bad at acting as the new Master Chief voice actor. I own Halo 4 and aside from graphics, the gameplay is identical to previous iterations. Nothing about it should appeal Halo fans who actually want the series to progress, because sadly, it has not. So, I ask you, do you think these reviewers get paid to say nice things?  




 We obviously know that our country is fucked and ran by a bunch of rich faggots. Our two party system is the biggest joke in the world and half our population stands by idly and bickers about Obama and Romney. I'm sick of just reading about how screwed up everything is, I'm ready to do something about it. What do we do? How do we give this country back to its people? It's obviously not gonna start at the ballot.  
























 I would hope everyone is aware of this website 














 Why don't they talk about the 3rd party candidates? They seem more preferable to me than Romney or Obama anyway. 

 




 It always seems like they form near Florida, respectively. But Y NO South Cali??? 




 Tonight I met someone who was beautiful, nice, had a good sense of humor and was just generally everything I was looking for. We then somehow got onto the topic of Religion and I expressed my faith in Jesus and she expressed that she is "Spiritual". It didn't end in argument, and it allowed me to share my testimony, etc. Fortunately, it didn't make things weird or anything. I would just like some advice from Christians if this would be wise to pursue if the possibility presented itself. I know what the answers are going to be, so please, help me to understand, because this person seems to be something special that doesn't come along very often. Thank you. 

EDIT: apparently she has a boyfriend. sweet. 









 I find if the kills in a multiplayer game get repetitive, the entire game gets old very fast. What do you guys think of the kills and rag doll thus far? Also, what kinds of things are deal breakers for you and a new game? 
























 With the advent of rag doll, and Euphoria physics used in games like GTA, and Backbreaker, why don't more games shy away from rehashed and reused death animations that make kills in games like Halo and CoD less satisfying and more repetitive? 

I play a shooter to have fun killing things, not see the same thing over and over again.  














 I've always loved the atmosphere Lovecraft creates with his description of entering tombs, down spiral stair cases with no light except a torch. Or the insanity that is instilled through the rising of Cthulu. Anything from his stories would be fantastic. Thank you :) 




 I'll start. 

I remember when the "Passion of the Christ" came out and hearing somebody say, "The Pope came forward today and has declared after viewing 'the Passion' that, 'It is, as it was' ". 

That pissed me off because, since when is the Pope the king of God?

Then I realized that a lot of the Catholics viewing this movie would have trusted the Pope's opinion. But that still doesn't make sense to me.  









 I visit, gmail; facebook; turntable.fm; ign; youtube; youjizz; and a few other lame sites. What are your most common? 
































































 just curious 









 After two months since the release of Counter Strike: Global Offensive on Xbox, there is still not a single patch or update that allows you to actually play with your friends. What the fuck is the point of buying the game!? Go fuck yourself Gabe.  









 Any ideas on how much the part and cost of labor would turn out to be? 
I live in PA if that matters. 









 Please be honest. I think some real life stories of healing, and other amazing experiences through God would bring great joy and increased faith to everyone here :)

EDIT: Thanks for all the stories and experiences, and I pray everyone has been strengthened in their faith through reading them. Keep em' coming! :D 




 A colossal planetary orb overlooks our home. Nearly at the climax of its Kiss with the rock we call Earth. Some of the most amazing shades of blue you'll ever see. Colors you don't find here. Colors artists attempt, and fail to replicate. It only peaks every 68 years, but you can always see it coming months in advance. A new star in the sky at first, then within half a year's time, the harvest moon dawns forth its peak. Some call it our planet's passing lover, some call it the thief, because it always drags our moon with it for a time before gravity can set itself right - which it always does. But when it does come, its always an exciting time here. The world seems to come together for nearly a year in the common endeavor to appreciate what some hold as God's passing eye. It pushes the rain away from certain areas, and you always know it's closest when the clouds gather and the water just won't stop falling. And then comes the twilit days and shadowless nights. By the time the sun hits noon, the sky is eclipsed, and the blue hues don't miss anything after sun down. It truly is an experience that all should share in at least one lifetime.

Sheel and I laid under the aquatic nightlight, atop our favorite get away spot overlooking our village - Of which was celebrating Peak Banquet. The festival lights gave illusion that the night's excitement was nearly at its apex, paralleling the sapphire that penetrated our night. I felt almost invigorated by the energy the blue bulb in the sky was giving off. And when we got away from all the noise, its song can be heard through energetic vibrations that hum only soft enough for those who listen closely - those who seek to hear. And as we laid there, holding hands, I could feel the vastness of the cosmic sphere reverberating through us both, nearly enhancing through our physical connection.

"They say it's getting closer, you know", Sheel gently let out. In my near hypnosis, I nearly missed what she'd said.

"Ah... You don't buy into that Collision Course fear do you?" I rattled off in nearly the same words I've heard from my parents time and time again. She paused for a long while, her eyes reflecting equally beautiful seas of blue back at the monster in the sky.

"I don't know...my father's been doing a lot of work at the observatory lately, and he says...something's changed." Her gaze never broke from the atmosphere, and I had no words to say. "He says at this rate, this might be the last cycle before...The Event. Silence filled the air as what she said began to pass over me. Fireworks could be seen popping and fading in sparkling reds and yellows near village square. The irony of it all nearly brought a smile to my face. We laid there quietly, looking directly at what some held in highest form of natural phenomenon and beauty, and by the same means, could very well bring about our end. But the fear, the fear had not over taken me. I knew I was exactly where I was suppose to be. Sheel grasped my hand even tighter, we looked into each others' eyes, and all I could hear was that gentle hum. 


































 here's a .gif  

EDIT: annnnd....it's gone! 




 She even munched Mila Kunis' rug pro bono

EDIT: pro boner  




 Failed it for the second time. Did 100 Questions a day for a month and a half - KAPLAN online resources.  Not sure how to approach it this time around. For those who passed, please explain to me the specific manner in which you went about studying so I can emulate that and also pass. Thanks :) also pray for me if you could.  




 took it today 8/30/12  0800-1245

-Got 245 Questions
-Finished the test on a Multiple Answer Question (not sure if I got it right, also not sure if that's a positive sign)
-got quite a few multiple answer questions, probably around 10-15 (still not sure if thats a good thing, but i hear those are higher end questions)
-only got 3 dosage calc out of 245 (which I hear the less dosage calc, the better)

Overall the test was really hard, but i feel i knew more than I did the first time (still not much lol). Was just looking for thoughts, ideas and support. :)

Thanks! 









 Sweden 





























 I lopped off my dick with less-than-average sharp scissors.

And then I buried my sleeping 3 day old infant underground. I doubt she's woken up yet. 

EDIT: don't tell mom 




 All I see on Reddit is negative statements about Romney, which I understand. But, why nothing about Obama? Why does this site lean so far left that it seems almost to refuse to give any sort of basic criticism to our current president? You would think, even by chance, that at least a few articles would make it to the front page once and a while. Am I the only one who notices this bias?... 

EDIT: Since I have you all here, I will now proceed to revealing that Satan runs this world, and dominates both the democratic and republican parties you all hold so dear. He is currently perverting the Jewish Zionists to use their endless stream of finances to rule everything you thought was for you: MEDIA, MILITARY, BANKS, and of course POLITICS. 

OBAMA is a shill, no different than BUSH and you all will live to see World War III. 9/11 was an inside job. Get off your knees and fight back 

RON PAUL 2012 - or Gary Johnson if we have to...sigh

 lately, every game i play i feel bored and as if i've played it already. I was hoping /r/gaming could point me in the direction of a game they've loved oh so much, but maybe not many people played it. Something different, like Shadow of the Colossus. Thanks! 




 Link; Cost?

 I'm just curious to see the differences between history books written at earlier times in the previous century. Thank you Reddit! 




 What if Ron Paul doesn't win the nomination/presidency? Do we just wait for all the DoomPaul memes to come true and embrace the end of the world or...? What's the plan? Because I don't see much hope without his truth and honesty in office.  
























 The Year: 2064

Grandpa walks into the living room to see his 6 year old grandson is laughing, laying prone in front of some sort of handheld gaming device while his
eyes are in REM. (Rapid Eye Movement)

"Hey buddy whaddya playin there?", asks grandpa looking at his grandson in confusion


Grandson quickly comes out of his REM and looks at his grandpa cheerfully and replies, "My Nintendo Synfesis Gwandpa!" With a lisp :) (Nintendo Synthesis)


Grandpa's confusion quickly subsides with a smile of relief and replies, "ohhh, Nintendo? Shoot, I used to have a 
Game Boy back in the day. Played the heck outta that thing"


"Grandpaaaa, dis isn't da same as a silwy Game Boyy", Grandson says laughingly annoyed.


"Whaddya talkin' abouuut? Lemme see that thing", retorts grandpa with confidence.


"We can pway together!" Excitedly replies grandson. Grandson proceeds to hand grandpa another one of the devices.
The device is merely a 3x3in rectangular chrome device with a rounded spherical bottom. Similar to a three dimensional ellipse 
divided in half with central a flat surface. 

Grandpa examines it oddly, looking on all sides, "Where's the D-Pad?...How do I turn this thing on?"


Giggling, grandson exclaims, "You just have to holwd it with boff hands gwandpaaa"


"Oh, okay", grandpa says as he places both hands on the device, "What're we even 'playing' anyway?"


"Caww of Duty: Stormfront!", excitedly replies grandson as he quickly gets comfortable and places both hands on the device,
at which point you begin to hear a low binaural beat begin to build within the system and slowly growing louder.


"Well CoD's kinda gay -- but What the heck is that sound?", asks grandpa in confusion.


"It's startin' up Gwandpa", replies grandson with a big innocent smile.


As the noise begins to grow grandpa's mind begins to wonder into nostalgic memories, "Oh...well you know when I was your age,
I would play Pokemon none stop. I swear, I had the best line-up ever. My Dragonite was level 100 -- " Suddenly,
within the blink of an eye grandpa is transported to a drop ship transport about to land in the middle of a barren planet war zone. He looks around 
in frantic fear and confusion, seeing he is surrounded by a dozen other future soldiers preparing to fight. Everyone is strapped into their seats with
metal chest harnesses, wearing futuristic black and grey military protective equipment and wielding heavy assault rifles. The ship is severely turbulent 
as it draws nearer to the surface of the battle. "What the hell is happening!? Where am I?!!!", cries Grandpa
to all of the nameless soldiers he is seated next to. All of which seem have their wits about them.


"Private! Get your shit together! Now is not the time to lose it!", commands what appears to be the Sergent of the ship's unit.


Grandpa is shocked in fear facing the Sergent, who returns his body to the upright position of his harnessed seat while someone next to grandpa gestures
the Catholic cross across their chest as they kiss their Christian pendant. Grandson then reveals his smiling face and waves "Hi, gwandpaaa!", says grandson
with cheer.


"Oh my God! What the hell is happeningggg!!!??" screams grandpa.


"We got to take the Cwompound, gwandpa" replies grandson as he rocks his head from side to side joyfully.


"What!!? What the hell are you talking about? What is this!!?, exclaims grandpa in utter fear and calamity.


"Just fowwow me grandpa!" laughs grandson as the ship comes to a sudden halt. 


"OhGodFUCK! What is hap-!" grandpa is screaming as The harnesses suddenly rise, and the side hatch of this ship immediately burst open. The noise quickly grows ten-fold, with near by explosions and dust flying so thick that its barely visible to see more than 20 feet in front of oneself.

"Alright Men! Into eternity we fly!" shouts the Sergent as he throws his hand forward giving the command to charge. Large amounts of similar ships can be 
seen landing, and leaving near their drop zone.The terrain is virtually flat as the dust bowl continues to fog any view besides what lies ahead.
 Hundreds of soldiers are running into the clouds of fog. 
Many of which are being mowed down by continued chain
gun fire and blown to pieces by explosions and artillery. 

Grandpa, standing in the haul doorway of the drop ship stares in disbelief at what he is witnessing when suddenly he feels quick jab to his
right leg and a grab
at his hand from grandson exclaiming, "Come on gwandpa, follow meeee". Grandson begins to run haphazardly into the fray of smoke.

"Wait! NO!" Grandpa yells as he suddenly becomes aware of his grandson sprinting into a firefight. Grandpa proceeds to sprint after him. As he runs blindly in grandson's last known direction,
all he can see is random soldiers faces gliding with him in his run as well as the amount of vigor and strength he now has that was not previously existent in his normal body's elder state. 
This revelation is quickly forgotten as nearly as soon as he sees more soldiers passing by him in the haze, they are quickly swept down by bursts and flashes of light and blasts from
whistling bombs from above. Dirt and debris began to soil grandpa's clothing.
A sudden cut back to grandpa and grandson in the living room shows both of them experiencing REM with grandpa's mouth wide open making odd screaming noises and grandson smiling and giggling.
Cut back to the battlefield, the only usable cover are large boulders that randomly appear through the haze. A large explosion in the distance knocks grandpa down to the ground, the heat from the blast causes his face
to be flushed in even more sweat. Grandpa scrambles on all fours to the nearest boulder that is nearly 12ft high and sizable enough
to cover four men. Large numbers of other soldiers continue to pass by on both sides. Grandpa presses his body tightly against the boulder next to soldiers of which are poised to return fire with no direct leader.
On grandpa's side is a medic attempting to revive an unconscious soldier with CPR and various medicinal shot administrations that only require the grasp of a trigger to instill into the skin. This is to no avail.

"God damn it, wake up!" Screams the medic to the dead soldier, of whom has a severe burns and lacerations to the entire front of the body.

The soldier on grandpa's other side nearest the edge of cover pops out and shoots blindly into the fog screaming, "Motherfuckerrrrsss!".
A stray bullet flies in and goes directly between the soldiers neck and clavicle. He collapses in front of grandpa grasping his neck as blood begins to spray out of his artery
with each heart beat. Grandpa's face is stricken with shock as he lets out a girlish screech.

 



























































 So i failed my nclex on 7/2/12 in the state of Pennsylvania. I went to the PA dept of state to reapply for the ATT and it said they "You already have a license of this type". And I wasn't sure if I have to wait a period of time before even apply again. They didn't make the whole 45-90 waiting period very clear. Can someone give me a clear explanation on the process I should go through? thanks :)

EDIT: I called. They said if you do a re-exam you need to send in a physical paper application. False alarm, I still failed... :/ 




 So i found out i failed the NCLEX which is the boards or test you need to pass to become a nurse. It sucks, but its obviously not the end of the world. The most frustrating issue was when i broke the news to my father, he was infuriated and continued to make a bunch of outlandish claims like, "things are gonna be changing around here!" and "You can get your own ride down to Harrisburg next time!" (the place of the test) and "This is bullshit!" - as if my failure is more of a detriment to him than it is me. He's not a christian if that's important, and I hate having issues with my dad. He's always been kind of a douche and often makes me feel like an idiot without considering my side of the story. I wanna tell him off but I also want to respect my parents and unfortunately, I still live under his roof until i can pass this stupid test and get a job. Basically, I would really appreciate prayer for passing the NCLEX test and my relationship with my father. Any advice would be cool too. Thanks.   




 So I took it yesterday, felt like I did horrible. And I mean horrible. Like, I didn't know anything. 230 questions later I was done. I got online the next day and some people said there's a trick you can do where if you try to register again on Pearson-Vue, if you passed, it won't let you go to the credit card screen. Unfortunately, it allowed me to make it to that screen and I feel like that has all but solidified my failure. Which, in turn, makes me feel like a sack of shite. Mainly because, I'll somehow, have to figure out how to change my study habits to pass next time. Which honestly, studying is the bane of my existence. Is there truth to the whole Pearson trick? Encouragement would be nice too ;P

 Not sure why /r/atheism hates christians so much. Sure, there can be some seriously ignorant followers who piss you off to the fullest extent, but not all christians are advocates of The Crusades. Not all christians molest children and try to tell you what to do. The message promoted by Jesus in the Gospels of the New Testament was that of peace, love and sacrifice. A lot of christians hold true to that and are great members of the community, helping the poor and needy. I know people like the Westboro baptist church are nuts, and a lot of other christians realize it as well. My biggest confusion with /r/atheism is, what's being accomplished by the top upvoted item being Jesus having sex with a goat? Your subreddit is flooded with this stuff. How is that evidence of people who claim to be critical thinkers, and well educated? Most of the time, rather than a legitimate debate, your subreddit is filled with hate. At times I wish the sub was renamed '/r/trolls'. It's not serving anyone. I suggest we take a step back and consider our actions.

1757- Colonial Scrip Issued in US

Debt free, fiat currency was printed in the public interest. As Benjamin Franklin said,

In the colonies we issue our own money. It is called colonial scrip. We issue it in proper proportion to the demands of trade and industry to make the products pass easily from the producers to the consumers. In this manner, creating for ourselves our own paper money, we control its purchasing power and we have no interest to pay no one.

1907- Banking Panic of 1907

The New York Stock Exchange dropped dramatically as everyone tried to get their money out of the banks at the same time across the nation. This banking panic spurred debate for banking reform. JP Morgan and others gathered to create an image of concern and stability in the face of the panic, which eventually led to the formation of the Federal Reserve. The founders of the Federal Reserve pretended like the bankers were opposed to the idea of its formation in order to mislead the public into believing that the Federal Reserve would help to regulate bankers when in fact it really gave even more power to private bankers, but in a less transparent way.

1921-1929  The Roaring 20s  The Federal Reserve Floods the Economy with Cash and Credit

From 1921 to 1929 the Federal Reserve increased the money supply by $28 billion, almost a 62% increase over an eight-year period.[3] This artificially created another boom.

1929  Federal Reserve Contracts the Money Supply

In 1929, the Federal Reserve began to pull money out of circulation as loans were paid back. They created a bust which was inevitable after issuing so much credit in the years before. The Federal Reserves actions triggered the banking crisis, which led to the Great Depression.

October 24, 1929  Black Thursday, Stock Market Crash

The most devastating stock market crash in history. Billions of dollars in value were consolidated into the private bankers hands at the expense of everyone else.

 A lot of crazy youtube sources keep predicting a nuclear and/or biological attack during the 2012 Olympic Games in London. Similar to the signs that pointed towards 9/11 occurring. All for the purpose of increased fear and furthered security to unite the world under one totalitarian big brother governing body. Has anyone else heard this? Please, I'm not trying to be crazy with this. I just want to hear peoples' thoughts on this that may have some sort of related information.

 I know this is a safe-haven for trolls, but please, no creepy pasta. I'm genuinely interested in real encounters and experiences.  
























 I'm talking about the weirdos and the thespians alike. What's your personal view of someone who openly sings at any given time, without prompt? Even the black dudes who sing to themselves loud as they walk by with their iPhones blaring.  









 So many people use old testament verses to put down the bible and it's meaning. I personally feel a lot of the crazier stuff of the old testament like Exodus 21 is specifically addressed to the Hebrews of that time and shouldn't be pulled out of context to shut down any biblical argument. What do you think?

EDIT: I don't know, the one thing I've seen for sure is that people with different views need to meet somewhere more personal than the internet. Not to be rude, but this Christianity vs Atheist is the biggest circlejerk on Reddit 









 I just saw the movie, Prometheus, and even though I can see the events clearly occur before the Alien movie timeline; I'm confused how the movie directly ties in as a prequel. I felt like there were quite a few script holes and plot decisions that didn't make sense. I can't think of many off the top of my head, but the movie left me a bit jaded. 

Any ideas my Reddit friends? 




 My grandmother has cancer that has metastasized (spread) all through her body including her pancreas, liver, spleen, and spinal cord. She is 87 y.o. Her husband, my grandfather, died of cancer 4 years prior and, even though she is cheerful, has never been in good health since. The clear prognosis (likelihood of the disease progression) is terminal (death). Unfortunately, even with that most definite outcome, the physicians (doctors) insist on continuing to perform procedures; of which will be billed to her insurance company.

She suffers from severe back pain, due to the cancer's spinal cord involvement, and the physicians say they want to perform a biopsy (take out a piece of the cancer for examination) to determine the best method of pain control for her palliative care (care for someone who's dying). I, personally, have never heard of a cancer biopsy being necessary to determine specific treatment for pain. Especially palliative. 

I know I probably just seem angry and accusative, but I would like my grandmother to spend as much time at home with her family as possible before she passes. I don't want to openly know that the doctors and hospital are just trying to gain a profit from her suffering. 

If anyone with personal experience, like someone who encountered a similar situation or someone in the medical field, could shed some light on this it would be much appreciated.

PS - I'm not blood related if anyone wanted to tell me to get early screening etc. :) 



















 I see Michael Ironside (voice of Sam Fisher) is being replaced by a different actor in Splinter Cell: Blacklist. What I don't understand is, if the events takes place after Conviction (where Sam Fisher already seemed like he was getting older), why would they replace him with a young actor with a young voice and it even appears Sam's movement is that of young stud. Why wouldn't they just do a prequel or something, when Sam was just starting to kick ass or something. I donno, I just don't like the taste this is putting in my mouth.  




 I feel like no one knows what's going on. And don't give me bullshit. You can't tell me that our 21st century minds have any iota of a clue to what the fuck all "THIS" is (the universe etc). All that has come to be is new theories, nothing proven. Life after death is NOT proven or disproven. Although, I've heard a ton more stories of near death/ out of body experiences where people say they've seen something (white light, God, whatever). I mean, holy shit, how can one be so arrogant as to utterly deny something that they have no possible way of understanding. Science is great, and has helped mankind tremendously, but to say it negates a spiritual perspective is outright stupid.

If you believe in atheism so much, why do you come to this subreddit just to be reassured that what you believe is right? Your actions are no different than the religious you shoot down (Culminating in the church of atheism).  Also, its become almost an unsaid duty of atheists to put down religion (that just seems low and also pointless). If what you believe is what you believe and that's the end of it, the need for a community to support your belief is erroneous.

Atheism doesn't help anyone either. At least religion or some sort of discipline gives people hope in something more. All atheism does is spread the word of nothingness and self-service and usually just an underlying way of expressing disgust with religion.

There's also this association with being an atheist and being educated. That's just an outright lie because, education (math, science, history etc) and personal beliefs are almost mutually exclusive and being atheist does not necessitate a higher IQ in any sense. 

Take a step back and compare yourself to anyone you know. Your understanding of this world and what's beyond holds no stronger basis than your neighbor. Before you go out of your way to explain to people the lack of an existence of a god/gods, maybe you should step out of your comfort zones and do some searching yourself. Even if that searching is within.

tl;dr - /r/atheism = /r/circlejerk

PS - all those pictures people post of "famous" atheists and their quotes - I've never seen a single one of them smiling 8(

 Don't take medication. It'll just create a need for it in your body that will increase your anxiety in the long run. Just pray, serve, be with people and exercise if you can. Realize that everything in your life is in the hands of Christ. Be Still And Know That I Am God.

 Yeah, GTA V's audience is far more expansive than CoD's. They might have been able to do a fraction of GTA's sales if they didn't pump out copypastas every year.

That should come in hindsight if you really care about your audience.

 I feel that every iteration of whatever racing series (Forza Motorsport, Gran Turismo etc.) all demo the amazing amount of detail put into the car models, yet they completely neglect some of the most fun parts of racing games - crashes. 

You have games such as Burnout that focus on that part of racing, yet it is on a grand end of the spectrum of racing games and takes a common part of cars and places it to the highest level. As entertaining as it is, it would be enjoyable to see what other game developers are capable of in the realm of car crashes and overall vehicle physics.

You have independent games such as [Beam NG](http://www.beamng.com/content/) that are experimenting with the limits of car destruction simulation and real time automobile malleability, which is exciting, novel and fresh. The only thing that comes as a shock is why more racing game developers haven't researched technology such as this and brought racing simulation to new level beyond current damage models. In some ways, when I play a racing game without realistic crashes, it's like playing a football game without tackles.

 I totally feel that. I felt like the maps were more open and the kills very satisfying. Twas the only multiplayer game that I played that I was totally satisfied with playing alone.

 I pray, I believe, I forgive, I read my Bible. I don't always go to church. I work full time as a nurse at a hospital. I work second shift and spend most of my time either sleeping, working, and free time late at night. My nights after work usually involve being with friends, or playing video games at home. I still struggle with pornography and various other daily sins that sometimes I do commit, and sometimes don't commit. I ask forgiveness and attempt to move forward. I just don't really know what I'm doing with my life anymore, because it seems like now that I'm working, time is flying by so fast. I feel like I've accomplished nothing for the Kingdom of Christ, other than trying to represent Him the best I can at work, I suppose. I don't get to see the body of Christ very often, and lately I've just been wondering if I am even fully following Christ. I just don't really know what to say or do anymore... 




 my origin name is JoelTheTroll  - add me or PM me if you want to play. I'm just getting started on PC and would love some friends to get started with, especially starting BF4 soon. I also need some advice on which mic setup to get. Thanks :) 



















 It works fine once you set it as primary in singleplayer but once i get to multiplayer it turns off at the beginning of a match and i have to unplug and plug it back in and i just don't get what is happening? 














 I purchased the game but have no idea really how to update or do much of anything technical. help? 














 I know this is probably posted a million times but I could use some prayers. I struggle with pornography and I just don't understand how to completely overcome it. There will be periods of time where I'll go on without doing it and I'll convince myself that it is gone forever, then temptation comes at me even harder, and I fall. I pray. I meditate. I even attempted to deliver myself from an unclean spirit that I thought may be hindering me (of which I'm still uncertain) and I can only ever last for maybe 2 weeks at the maximum. I want to overcome this because I want to show God that I'm ready for a serious relationship with him and possibly a wife, if he'll permit it. But I feel so held back. I feel accused by it, and then I feel weak. I turn to Jesus and know that  I am redeemed but I always feel like I'm such a let down to Jesus. I very much want to cleanse myself of this so that I can show God I'm ready and mature. But I suppose all I can ask for is prayers.  




 This is a very general, basic question...answer individually as you deem true.

But, I'll give you a specific example of my life...I am a new nurse at my local hospital and there is a particular female that I have began to find very attractive. Her outer beauty of course. But her personality is just so boisterous and exuberant. She is just a fantastic joy to listen to and a very positive energy. And I think what created the greatest attraction was when she would openly talk about Jesus in such a confident manor amidst fellow employees. The only unfortunate part is that, though our interactions have been positive and a possible chemistry is there, I feel that our jobs are so busy. We hardly have time to truly create a foundational friendship. This leaves me in a very silly situation. Logic tells me, don't be moronic and rushingly ask her out before you really know her and end up looking like a fool. But instinct tells me, if I wait too long and don't establish some sort of relationship, I will miss my chance and regret it. I'm not sure what to say really, because I know my issue is really a generally mild topic. I'm just at a strange point in my life where I have begun my career and it takes up a majority of my time, and I feel that my primary time to mingle will be in my work environment and I truly would enjoy having someone to share my life with. I know I'm probably wayyyy over thinking it, but I have no idea how to approach this situation, or if I should even give it a second thought. An odd duality of all or nothing. Maybe you can Pray that God give me a clear mind? 




 The Bible tells us that there's a constant war going on around us. A war that involves the spiritual heavenly hosts and principalities of darkness. I personally feel that this says so much in regards to the Christian faith. I feel that this says so much more than just going to church every Sunday and putting on a smile for our white suburban brothers at a midweek bible study. The bible is essentially saying there are beings that have existed, spiritually, in our world, or realm, for an uncounted number of lifetimes. The beings have seen nation rise and nation fall. These beings are the ultimate researchers on the human condition and can predict what you're going to do before you even decide that you will do it. Some of these creations have even sat at the foot of God's throne.
I suppose where my issue is, is in my own life. I, like many Christians, battle against Sin and the world daily. I pray. I read the Bible. I try to represent Christ the best I can. I fail many times. I know there is much more going on in our world than just what we see with our eyes and speak with our mouths. But at times, I wonder if I will ever truly understand or partake in this supernatural battle that rages on. I'm a nurse at a hospital who helps people daily, sure, but its still just a job at times. I then proceed home and fiddle on my computer and maybe be with friends. It's a relatively monotonous life, that has been replicated one billion times over in many other countries and timelines. 

I guess my biggest question is: Can I expect to experience God on a supernatural level, the kind that changes lives, or is my meandering lifestyle going to hold me back from truly seeing what I know is out there until the day my soul leaves body? 




 Wonder, Miracle, Beauty movies?  Suggest your favorite, if you'd be so kind.  
























 It truly is a fascinating piece of literature that fits within Biblical canon and timeline. It covers interesting topics such as End Times, detail on Fallen Angels interbreeding with human woman - creating giants (Nephilim mentioned in Genesis 6:4 and in Daniel, of whom were a primary cause of God's Flood) - and also covering "The Just One", commonly perceived as Christ. Below are also some references towards Enoch in the Bible. 

**Hebrews 11:5** - 5 By faith Enoch was taken from this life, so that he did not experience death: He could not be found, because God had taken him away. For before he was taken, he was commended as one who pleased God.

**Genesis 4:17-18** - 17 Cain made love to his wife, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch. Cain was then building a city, and he named it after his son Enoch. 18 To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael was the father of Methushael, and Methushael was the father of Lamech.

**Genesis 5:18-19** - 18 When Jared had lived 162 years, he became the father of Enoch. 19 After he became the father of Enoch, Jared lived 800 years and had other sons and daughters.

**Genesis 5:21-24** - 21 When Enoch had lived 65 years, he became the father of Methuselah. 22 After he became the father of Methuselah, Enoch walked faithfully with God 300 years and had other sons and daughters. 23 Altogether, Enoch lived a total of 365 years. 24 Enoch walked faithfully with God; then he was no more, because God took him away.

**1 Chronicles 1:3** - 3 Enoch, Methuselah, Lamech, Noah.

**Luke 3:37** - 37 the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch,

the son of Jared, the son of Mahalalel,

the son of Kenan,


What are you thoughts as to why it was not included in The Bible?

 And why do people hate it? 
























 I ask this because, the majority of the time we come across something related to secret societies, such as the Illuminati, they are presented as a "Satanic" group and oppose the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth. Since the majority of the users in here are in opposition to this group, can I ask if your beliefs align with the Christian Theology?

Edit: Interesting that there is a lot of anti "religion" perspectives. Understandable. But when you examine the four Gospels and the example Jesus set within that narrative, some will note that Jesus too was against meaningless religion. He despised the Pharisees that had manipulated Judaism at that time for their own personal gain. It appears that what Jesus really came to do was demonstrate and create a way for individuals to be in direct communion with God. Jesus was liberating the people from religion and leading them to relationship and faith. When examining the source documents of the accounts with Jesus, one can immediately identify a paradoxical teaching that is prevalent between what Jesus said and what some modern religious establishments teach. In a way, The Illuminati, or Satan, would actually support the binding and legalism that some current "Christian" groups hold over there followers. While Satan has infiltrated religion, he fears the masses beginning to understand the relationship that can be had with God through Jesus.  









 What is its context? Why is it so harsh? Does it apply to modern day followers? 









 I think hearing about some people's low points in their faith or before they found Christ and how they bounced back through the power of Christ would encourage a lot of people who at times don't feel worthy of God's Love. But of course, God's Love is ever extending :) 




 I'm incredibly excited for GTA V coming out but I also feel as if though I shouldn't be and give up games all together. Any thoughts? 




 I have accepted Christ as my Lord and savior many years ago, but as many do, I have some questions. Lately, when I spend way too much time on Youtube, I get a really mixed message on Salvation. 

I watch these [videos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYINqTN1SBw) that tend to make me feel as if though I still am condemned, even after years of walking with Christ. I obviously haven't been perfect, and it's a daily struggle. But I just need some clarification on the life that Jesus excepts from me. When I watch these videos, it often times makes me terrified that I'm not doing enough. 

I've always been taught that Grace trumps the Law, but lately I'm feeling very condemned by the message of Law that's being presented. 

My life consists of working at a retirement home and daily reading my scriptures and praying. I still struggle with various sins and I just don't know what to think anymore. I am constantly bombarded with the message that I haven't done enough but also the message that only through Christ's sacrifice are we sufficient before God. When I come across opportunities to talk to people about Jesus, I do. Should I be doing more? Should I leave the working world? I feel condemned and I just need truth and encouragement.

TL;DR - I'm getting mixed messages 



















 I'm surprised more games don't use the awesome [Euphoria Animation System](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6F3lT1v79I) that can be seen in games like Max Payne 3 and Star Wars: The Force Unleashed. With the repetition that comes with seeing the same death animations in games like Call of Duty through the use of Motion Capture, you would think that more development studios would utilize the novelty and variety of Euphoria Animation. It's one of the primary reasons I always looked forward to most of the recent iterations in the Rockstar franchise. The level of visceral movement that is procedurally generated from the Euphoria engine leaves me wanting more after every experience and I would love to see how it will shape this generation and next generation games' animation development. Thoughts?

 The Year: 2064

 

Grandpa walks into the living room to see his 6 year old grandson is laughing, laying prone in front of some sort of handheld gaming device while his

eyes are in REM. (Rapid Eye Movement)

 

"Hey buddy whaddya playin there?", asks grandpa looking at his grandson in confusion

 

 

Grandson quickly comes out of his REM and looks at his grandpa cheerfully and replies, "My Nintendo Synfesis Gwandpa!" With a lisp :) (Nintendo Synthesis)

 

 

Grandpa's confusion quickly subsides with a smile of relief and replies, "ohhh, Nintendo? Shoot, I used to have a

Game Boy back in the day. Played the heck outta that thing"

 

 

"Grandpaaaa, dis isn't da same as a silwy Game Boyy", Grandson says laughingly annoyed.

 

 

"Whaddya talkin' abouuut? Lemme see that thing", retorts grandpa with confidence.

 

 

"We can pway together!" Excitedly replies grandson. Grandson proceeds to hand grandpa another one of the devices.

The device is merely a 3x3in rectangular chrome device with a rounded spherical bottom. Similar to a three dimensional ellipse

divided in half with central a flat surface.

 

Grandpa examines it oddly, looking on all sides, "Where's the D-Pad?...How do I turn this thing on?"

 

 

Giggling, grandson exclaims, "You just have to holwd it with boff hands gwandpaaa"

 

 

"Oh, okay", grandpa says as he places both hands on the device, "What're we even 'playing' anyway?"

 

 

"Caww of Duty: Stormfront!", excitedly replies grandson as he quickly gets comfortable and places both hands on the device,

at which point you begin to hear a low binaural beat begin to build within the system and slowly growing louder.

 

 

"Well CoD's kinda gay -- but What the heck is that sound?", asks grandpa in confusion.

 

 

"It's startin' up Gwandpa", replies grandson with a big innocent smile.

 

 

As the noise begins to grow grandpa's mind begins to wonder into nostalgic memories, "Oh...well you know when I was your age,

I would play Pokemon none stop. I swear, I had the best line-up ever. My Dragonite was level 100 -- " Suddenly,

within the blink of an eye grandpa is transported to a drop ship transport about to land in the middle of a barren planet war zone. He looks around

in frantic fear and confusion, seeing he is surrounded by a dozen other future soldiers preparing to fight. Everyone is strapped into their seats with

metal chest harnesses, wearing futuristic black and grey military protective equipment and wielding heavy assault rifles. The ship is severely turbulent

as it draws nearer to the surface of the battle. "What the hell is happening!? Where am I?!!!", cries Grandpa

to all of the nameless soldiers he is seated next to. All of which seem have their wits about them.

 

 

"Private! Get your shit together! Now is not the time to lose it!", commands what appears to be the Sergent of the ship's unit.

 

 

Grandpa is shocked in fear facing the Sergent, who returns his body to the upright position of his harnessed seat while someone next to grandpa gestures

the Catholic cross across their chest as they kiss their Christian pendant. Grandson then reveals his smiling face and waves "Hi, gwandpaaa!", says grandson

with cheer.

 

 

"Oh my God! What the hell is happeningggg!!!??" screams grandpa.

 

 

"We got to take the Cwompound, gwandpa" replies grandson as he rocks his head from side to side joyfully.

 

 

"What!!? What the hell are you talking about? What is this!!?, exclaims grandpa in utter fear and calamity.

 

 

"Just fowwow me grandpa!" laughs grandson as the ship comes to a sudden halt.

 

 

"OhGodFUCK! What is hap-!" grandpa is screaming as The harnesses suddenly rise, and the side hatch of this ship immediately burst open. The noise quickly grows ten-fold, with near by explosions and dust flying so thick that its barely visible to see more than 20 feet in front of oneself.

 

"Alright Men! Into eternity we fly!" shouts the Sergent as he throws his hand forward giving the command to charge. Large amounts of similar ships can be

seen landing, and leaving near their drop zone.The terrain is virtually flat as the dust bowl continues to fog any view besides what lies ahead.

 Hundreds of soldiers are running into the clouds of fog.

Many of which are being mowed down by continued chain

gun fire and blown to pieces by explosions and artillery.

 

Grandpa, standing in the haul doorway of the drop ship stares in disbelief at what he is witnessing when suddenly he feels quick jab to his

right leg and a grab

at his hand from grandson exclaiming, "Come on gwandpa, follow meeee". Grandson begins to run haphazardly into the fray of smoke.

 

"Wait! NO!" Grandpa yells as he suddenly becomes aware of his grandson sprinting into a firefight. Grandpa proceeds to sprint after him. As he runs blindly in grandson's last known direction,

all he can see is random soldiers faces gliding with him in his run as well as the amount of vigor and strength he now has that was not previously existent in his normal body's elder state.

This revelation is quickly forgotten as nearly as soon as he sees more soldiers passing by him in the haze, they are quickly swept down by bursts and flashes of light and blasts from

whistling bombs from above. Dirt and debris began to soil grandpa's clothing.

A sudden cut back to grandpa and grandson in the living room shows both of them experiencing REM with grandpa's mouth wide open making odd screaming noises and grandson smiling and giggling.

Cut back to the battlefield, the only usable cover are large boulders that randomly appear through the haze. A large explosion in the distance knocks grandpa down to the ground, the heat from the blast causes his face

to be flushed in even more sweat. Grandpa scrambles on all fours to the nearest boulder that is nearly 12ft high and sizable enough

to cover four men. Large numbers of other soldiers continue to pass by on both sides. Grandpa presses his body tightly against the boulder next to soldiers of which are poised to return fire with no direct leader.

On grandpa's side is a medic attempting to revive an unconscious soldier with CPR and various medicinal shot administrations that only require the grasp of a trigger to instill into the skin. This is to no avail.

 

"God damn it, wake up!" Screams the medic to the dead soldier, of whom has a severe burns and lacerations to the entire front of the body.

 

The soldier on grandpa's other side nearest the edge of cover pops out and shoots blindly into the fog screaming, "Motherfuckerrrrsss!".

A stray bullet flies in and goes directly between the soldiers neck and clavicle. He collapses in front of grandpa grasping his neck as blood begins to spray out of his artery

with each heart beat. Grandpa's face is stricken with shock as he lets out a girlish screech.

 

"Fuckin' pull him over here!" Demands the medic. With slight hesitation, grandpa begins to drag the hemorrhaging soldier closer to cover and the medic. As he lets go, the medic screams for

grandpa to, "Hold pressure on it!". As grandpa places his hands in a viscous pool of blood, his clothes and face are quickly covered in red spurts and drops with each diminishing amount of

circulation. A sudden cut back to the living room shows a paralleled horror on grandpa's face.

 

"Stay with me!" screams the medic as he scrambles through his pack for more gauze pads. The nameless soldier is looking directly in to the eyes of Grandpa as the soldier takes his last

liquid filled breaths and his eyes leave focus past grandpa and into the distance. The pressure from the open vessel that grandpa is rigorously holding begins to halt completely and the soldier's eyes slowly fade shut.

Covered in blood and earth, grandpa stares deeply in astonishment at the man that is lifeless in his arms. Grandpa hears no sound around him.

 

 

"Whatchya doin' gwandpa???", abruptly questions grandson of which pulls grandpa from his haze in disbelief that his grandson was standing before him, let alone smiling. The assault rifle almost larger than he was.

"We gotta' take the compownd, gwandpa. Hurwy up!" Grandson grabs grandpa's hand and pulls him up off his knees and they begin to race in the direction that all the other soldiers are heading.

In the distance, the flashes from the machine guns can be seen quickly approaching. As they came closer, the number of bodies increased as well as the number falling soldiers all around them.

Grandpa sees a large trench system approaching, and grandson jumping into it. In fear for his grandson's life, he races into the trench. He follows his grandson's lead and keeps his head down.

They are now progressing through a large labyrinthine trench and begin to follow a small group of about eight allied soldiers. The gun fire and explosions are constant and it is nearly suicide to lift

attempt a view outside of what was becoming a mass grave. The dust was not as nearly as dense within the trench system and soldiers could be seen attempting to enter the trench only to be laced with crossfire. The artillery fire

was creating large amounts of debris and, at times, human extremities to soar through the air.  

 

 

"They're fuckin' killin' us out there! We need to take that compound!" Exclaims the drop ship Sergent, as he slides to meet his team within the trench.

 

 

Grandpa's heart is in a constant state of continuous adrenaline and his pupils are fixed on following his grandson and the other soldiers in any direction they choose to progress.

 

"Don't worwy gwandpa, I know where I'm gowing. I beat this pwart yestawday", reassures grandson. Grandpa continues to follow in complete amazement and horror.

They suddenly approach within 25 meters, the flank of a larger artillery gun and anti-air guns that combined blasts create vibrations so dense that, with each explosive blast, the ground is shaken to its core and human

ears enter into utter shell shock ringing and tinnitus. Grandson abruptly throws up  his fist, giving the command to halt. Grandpa stares in focus and silence as he sees the enemy is completely unaware, garbed in

ghillie suit uniforms that match the gray and tanned tones of this alien world. Grandson motions for half of the assembled team to approach the artillery nest from a branching trench path, creating an alternative

angle of attack.

 

Without hesitation, grandson turns around to grandpa and says, "You eva shwot one-a deez?", revealing a missile launcher and tossing it at grandpa who nearly stumbles upon catching it. Grandpa stares in bewilderment.

"It's swimple, just aim and shwoot." Giggles grandson as he motions the remaining men to ready their rifles. "On my cwommand", says grandson. Grandpa quickly shakes himself out of his emotional paralysis and readys the launcher on

his shoulder, looking down the display system. Which aumatically targets the largest artillery canon, stating "FIR RDY". The artillery team continues their foundation shattering battery and the team of soldiers lead by

grandson have their rifles aimed at the ready directly towards the enemy nest and grandpa is sitting shaking with a rocket launcher reluctantly pointed at an unknown adversary. Time comes to a near crawl and the beads of sweat

roll down grandpa's jittering face....

 

"COVERWING FIYA!!!" Commands grandson with all the air in his little lungs as he and the rest of the team light up the air with assault rifle rounds into the naive opposing forces. At that moment, grandpa, reflexively pulls the launching

trigger and a missile expels a huge back draft that pushes the dust around the trench out in all directions and in the blink of an eye the projectile burst forward and then 100 ft straight into the air. The recoil cascades

grandpa onto his back. All he can see is nameless soldiers unloading clips in a congruent direction and his grandson laughing as he hip fires his gun using a shoulder strap. Without warning, like a comet, the projectile hurdles

directly downward and a bright flash of blinding white light and silence is all that can be sensed. Everyone takes cover and awaits visual clarity. Of which is obtained after a large gust of particles are pushed past the entire squad

through the cravas of the trench. All that remains is a massive thick smoke cloud, forming out of a crater in the ground where the artillery nest was previously located. As grandpa began to gain his bearring, white ash began to settle

over them like snow.

 

"Nice shwot, gwandpa!" exclaims grandson as all the soldiers cry out in victory. Amongst the shear epicness of the entire situation, grandpa manages to release a small smirk on his mug as the chills of success reverberate throughout his spine.

 Grandpa looks at his grandson, as he begins to climb to the edge of the trench and stand before his fellow soldiers. "We have twaken down deir defwenses. Now we must bwing down their stwonghold! Fowwow me to Victorweee!!!"

Grandson cries as he lifts his guns over his head with both arms. Every soldier, including grandpa cannot help but roar with courage.

 

*CRACK*

 

Is all that is heard. Grandson stumbles at his perch, and places his hand on his chest revealing crimson painting his fingers.

 

"Noooooo!!" Screams grandpa as he rushes to bottom of the trench and catches his grandson as he falls. All is silent as every soldier stares onward at grandpa holding his fatally wounded grandson in his embracing arms. Tears glisten down his face,

unable to vocalize his grief past his disbelief.

 

"Gwandpa", whispers grandson in grandpa's ear.

 

"Yes", quickly relishes grandpa - at his kin's every word.

 

 

"GAME OVERRRRRRRRRRR", interrupts an ominous and robotic voice heard over top all the game world. At which the entire environment begins to suddenly breakdown around grandpa and he and grandson are rapidly whisked back to the their living room.

 

Grandpa looks onward in a stupor, completely motionless for several seconds when grandson interrupts, "What do ya fink gwandpa??" Pausing, and taking a few curious sniffs of the air, "What's dat smell?"

 

 

Cuts to an exiting add line from Nintendo stating, "Nintendo Synthesis - It'll make your grandpa shit his fuckin' pants" 




 A colossal planetary orb overlooks our home. Nearly at the climax of its Kiss with the rock we call Earth. Some of the most amazing shades of blue you'll ever see. Colors you don't find here. Colors artists attempt, and fail to replicate. It only peaks every 68 years, but you can always see it coming months in advance. A new star in the sky at first, then within half a year's time, the harvest moon dawns forth its peak. Some call it our planet's passing lover, some call it the thief, because it always drags our moon with it for a time before gravity can set itself right - which it always does. But when it does come, its always an exciting time here. The world seems to come together for nearly a year in the common endeavor to appreciate what some hold as God's passing eye. It pushes the rain away from certain areas, and you always know it's closest when the clouds gather and the water just won't stop falling. And then comes the twilit days and shadowless nights. By the time the sun hits noon, the sky is eclipsed, and the blue hues don't miss anything after sun down. It truly is an experience that all should share in at least one lifetime.

Sheel and I laid under the aquatic nightlight, atop our favorite get away spot overlooking our village - Of which was celebrating Peak Banquet. The festival lights gave illusion that the night's excitement was nearly at its apex, paralleling the sapphire that penetrated our night. I felt almost invigorated by the energy the blue bulb in the sky was giving off. And when we got away from all the noise, its song can be heard through energetic vibrations that hum only soft enough for those who listen closely - those who seek to hear. And as we laid there, holding hands, I could feel the vastness of the cosmic sphere reverberating through us both, nearly enhancing through our physical connection.

"They say it's getting closer, you know", Sheel gently let out. In my near hypnosis, I nearly missed what she'd said.

"Ah... You don't buy into that Collision Course fear do you?" I rattled off in nearly the same words I've heard from my parents time and time again. She paused for a long while, her eyes reflecting equally beautiful seas of blue back at the monster in the sky.

"I don't know...my father's been doing a lot of work at the observatory lately, and he says...something's changed." Her gaze never broke from the atmosphere, and I had no words to say. "He says at this rate, this might be the last cycle before...The Event. Silence filled the air as what she said began to pass over me. Fireworks could be seen popping and fading in sparkling reds and yellows near village square. The irony of it all nearly brought a smile to my face. We laid there quietly, looking directly at what some held in highest form of natural phenomenon and beauty, and by the same means, could very well bring about our end. But the fear, the fear had not over taken me. I knew I was exactly where I was suppose to be. Sheel grasped my hand even tighter, we looked into each others' eyes, and all I could hear was that gentle hum. 




 Can this fraud go on any longer? Can this self perpetuating cycle of debt sustain itself? I know no one can predict the future but does anyone have any predictions about the future of our beloved "centralized banking system"? Will their reign cease to fall? Or will it collapse in upon itself? 









 My life is pretty boring. I work 2-11pm and then go hang out with friends until 4AM, the majority of which aren't Christians. I try to hang out with some Christian friends but often time find myself bored because they think having fun is watching a Disney movie or something. I then sleep until I have to go back to work again. My life is boring and I don't know how to reinvigorate my Faith and life. Could use prayer and guidance.  









 I watched a video about an African pastor who had an out of body experience (OBE) in which he died and saw [Heaven and Hell](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA7mtcJ748U) and was brought back to life. The angel told him that if he died right now he would go to Hell because he did not forgive his wife of what she had done in the past. This filled me with a lot of fear, as I wondered what other Sins I may be committing that could detrimentally send me to Hell if I did not make myself right with God and how I go about that. It confused me, as well, making me thankful that Jesus presented this pastor with his separating Sin but wonder where the line is drawn where we are covered by grace but also held accountable? 

I know this crosses the barrier of works vs grace, but I need some Biblical encouragement and clarification. Maybe some personal experiences? 




 I feel like I'm in a constant battle with sin and am constantly losing. I need encouragement, because at times I fear the loss of my salvation. I try to be good, but i make so many mistakes. Sometimes I wonder if i was ever saved at all. But i truly do believe and understand Christ forgives all sins and try to live a good life but I sometimes hide from God, in a world of sin. I just need prayer for this struggle. Encouraging words and thank you.  




 I live in the basement and my room has a bathroom on the other side of the room. In the dream, I thought I saw strange lights coming from the bathroom. Wearing only my undies, I went over to investigate. As I approached the door, I can hear a vibratory noise growing louder with every closing step. In a bold curiosity, I burst open the door to witness three shadowy figures standing side by side in my bathroom, one substantially taller in the center of them. The vibrational noise was nearly deafening and originated from a black portal that stretched the length of the wall. It was wide enough for one person to enter through at a time and had a purple energetic hue pulsating around it. In fear of these featureless entities, I immediately fall backwards out of the bathroom grasping the knob, pulling the door closed. Nearly instantly, I snap out of my shock and am determined that whatever they are doing is malevolent. Being already on the floor, I thrust my body into the door to stop whatever it is they are doing. Now there is a large gust of energy and sound that is pressing back to keep me from entering. I am barely able to peak my head in as my hair flies back from the propulsive forces. I witness the two smaller entities begin to depart by stepping casually through the portal. In utter terror, I am left beholding the larger creature standing before me. He proceeds to slowly turn, that which I consider to be the shape of his head, in my direction. I lay pressed against the door and forceful winds, vulnerable and powerless as to his next action. Suddenly, he projects a grotesque  image of a mummified face, wrappings loosely hanging off, and shoots this illusion in my direction with a swift breath. I am abruptly overtaken with a fearful paralysis that casts me to the ground, shutting the door.  That's when I wake up.  









 If a lot of people on here believe 9/11 was an inside job, who should be held responsible? Just like any other crime, who would have benefited the most from this particular string of events? I know many companies benefit from war, but are there any particular individuals that are highly connected? 




 ...and why there are no alternative theories besides creationism? 









 Its a beautiful woman with a green background and she has a beast with a snake body but with a ton of different animal heads. It's an amazing picture but i can't find it anywhere on the internet. Any ideas of who it is or a link? Thank you 




 Often times when I feel spiritually moved and sometimes without feeling internally emotional, I experience a vibration or chills that reverberate through my body. I experience this often times and most commonly only when I am partaking in or thinking about something related to Jesus or God. Does anyone else have experiences of "feelings" that they usually equate with the presence or stirring of The Holy Spirit?

 only I understand the complexities of dish-doing 














 Often times from the teens to mid 20s, I've noticed women are more interested in the a-hole or the one who doesn't pay them as much attention. Does this perspective change in women as they get older and look back and wish they would have dated that nice guy? And if so, at what point do most girls then find the nice guy more appealing? 




 With oil controlling the market and primarily how most cars are fueled, what do you foresee the future of automobiles and overall transportation developing towards?     Flying cars is an acceptable answer 














 If he hypothetically didn't die and the news is just presenting him as dead, won't they easily be contradicted when he strikes again? If his wallet was found at the scene of the burning building, how was his ID identified at the U.S./Mexican border? Was the character of Dorner a creation of the media to distract us from something? There just seems to be a lot of contradictions that I am not understanding.  














 What are the riches that we receive in Heaven? I've realized I am nothing without God, and I have put my faith in salvation in Jesus as He who has given me the grace to enter His Father's kingdom. My only issue is that sometimes I do not always go "without sin" and I am ashamed of this. I'd ask that you pray for me about this. I am also curious as to what are the riches of Heaven that we receive? Do some of us get a gold mansion and others end up in a cardboard box? I would be okay with being homeless in Heaven than a landlord in Hell. Once again, I'd ask that you would pray that I would see no pleasure in Sin and love God through obedience, and if you can help me to understand my overlying question, thanks! Jesus is endless gracious :) 




 This is the internet. Fuck you --- Shun shunnnnn shhhhunnnn. Obama. Huffington Post. Papa Johns. Everyone better share MY interests! MY INTERESTS! MINE!!!!!!!!! ME ME ME ME MEEEeeeee  









 I see a lot of evil in this world, especially in the corruption of the United States government. Don't get me wrong, I understand the power of prayer and the coming of Jesus one day, but is it wrong of me to want to make a change with violence? Our forefathers were Christian, and they fought for their independence from tyranny a few hundred years ago. Is it such a bad thing to want to take a stand against the direction that I see our nation heading towards? Some may not see our country going in the direction of evil and tyranny that I perceive but I can feel it in my bones and feel it necessary to make some sort of serious change or resistance in the future. Any thoughts? Please consider what I'm saying, because countries like Germany and China have disarmed their citizens prior to enslaving them in past and I see it coming soon. It's obvious Satan has infiltrated our government long ago. I just need some serious discourse. Thank you.  



















 At times when I read the Gospels I feel this amazing sense of freedom from sin when Jesus preaches his purpose and in the later books that speak about works NOT being what gets you to Heaven. But then I see other scriptures that talk very highly of repentance and completely ridding your life of sin or else you will go to Hell. It creates this confusion, or paradox that leaves me stranded in my Faith. There are certain sins that I struggle with daily, and am trying to overcome. Yet because I have not overcame them, I feel various preaches condemning me to Hell, even though I have faith that Jesus is my representative before God and has justified me. I don't use Jesus to reason why I should continue sinning, I just fall sometimes and I can't comprehend this mixed message of Law vs Grace.  




 I've been having difficulty lately as a new RN grad to find a job that doesn't require at least 6 months of experience and I was recently hired as an RN in a local nursing home. Apparently I will be one of the only RN's they have and their pay is, from what I heard, "an insult to RNs" - 15$/hr. Which for me is fine, as its a pay increase from minimum wage and I need the experience. Any advise from other nurses who worked in the assisted living field?

 I work at a bar so my sleep schedule is already pretty off. I sleep in everyday and stay up late normally. But lately, as we enter winter, I sleep in longer and longer. What's even weirder is sometimes I'll wake up, have a hearty breakfast and want to go right back to sleep for a few more hours. I'm also struggling finding a real job out of college and I don't know if that is creating a depression inside myself that also adds to my desire to sleep. But I'm also just generally interested in the normal changes that happen to the human body entering into the winter months. Thanks  




 Crisis 2 wasn't as great a hit as they anticipated, mainly due to it's CoD style compromised gameplay. I just don't anticipate Crisis 3 to do any better due to in part that it seems like it being rushed out the door.

 I keep hearing the US economy is about to implode and I hear it is smart to put your assets in Gold and Silver rather than paper generated money. Is this pointing to the idea of a debt based economy that we all just put our faith into? Also, how would I go about purchasing gold and silver? 




 BORRRRRRINGGGGGGG

 I always find that as soon as I demonstrate an interest towards a female, she seems to hold very little interest. But the girl that I don't care about and pick on, most commonly has interest in me? It just seems to be a cruel cycle.  



















 I know a lot of games have deadlines and I'm curious to hear from the perspective of the developers who are forced to put out a product long before they feel it is ready or satisfactory. Thanks :) 




 I'm curious as to their purposes and how and what the body uses them for. Also, in what order and when does your body break down your own body's tissues for energy? Maybe you could also relate this to working out so people have a good idea of what workouts burn fat/and build muscle and maybe proper nutrition? I know its a lot, and tackle this as you see fit. Thank you ahead of time 




 For most Christian men, masturbation is a struggle. Lust is accompanies it. About three weeks ago I stopped looking at porn/masturbating and felt incredibly strong in my faith. Oddly enough, the temptations became stronger as I felt my hormones rising daily. My hope was to have a wet dream - so I'd feel blameless etc etc. I didn't and just today I suddenly gave in and now I feel super guilty. But people alert me that guilt is not from God, and that it's not through anything we do that gets us to Heaven but through Christ alone and what He did on the cross. So, why do I still feel this incredibly amount of guilt when I should, quite possibly, be joyous that even in my lows, Jesus still loves me?

Thanks

PS - also, I gave in kind of after I felt that I had received what I wanted, which was a passing grade on a huge certification exam. I told myself that didn't play into it and that I just wanted to love and obey God, but I feel that after getting what I wanted, my selfish motives were presented 10 fold. Thoughts/prayers? and thnx

EDIT: Sorry if im not politically correct about terms. Just being honest 














 When I asked my father about the recent bombings, he responds by saying that he hopes they kill all of those muslim radicals. I try to explain to him that the situation is a lot more complicated than that and that Israel is more so to blame than Pakistan and that Israel is just as horrible to Pakistani people, he just brushes me off. He tries to quote the news but I attempt to explain to him that the news is going to paint our allies in a good light because the news is run by Israel and his immediate response is , "oh, you're an Antisemite". And it's just so frustrating trying to have a conversation with him because he sees everything from the perspective of a closed minded american who sits on his couch and watches football all day. I just don't feel educated on the topic enough to present my points out reasonably. Can someone help me to justify that Israel isn't as good as we make them out to be and why we're even allies with them?

EDIT: Palestine....shows how much I know.... 














 I met this non-Christian girl and we hit it off very well initially. It went so well as for me to, in some ways, set aside my belief that Christians have to marry other Christians, as I thought it would be too closed minded for me to give up an opportunity with someone like her. She is very kind, beautiful and loving and we had a great time the first few times we hung out. She then, randomly, alerted me over text message that she is in a 2 year relationship that is now long distance, but obviously still wanted to be friends. When I heard that, I actually cried, it was embarrassing, and I was at work and my boss saw me and let me go home. I thought I'd probably never hear from her much after that but she would still contact me in the mornings via text to see how my day was going and we went on a hike where I was able to share the gospel with her and very briefly express my feelings and desire to maintain friendship (tho I want more). As much as I figured the relationship would remain platonic, the generally flirtatious messages were still being sent from her. Eventually I felt as though she was tapering me out of her life, as I didn't receive any messages for a few days. But then, just yesterday she invited me over to watch a movie with her. We did so and nothing happened but at this point I just don't know how to take her. Because in her mind, she might think she has cleared the air with me and can play the innocent card if I confront her about our purposes together, but I can't help but feel as if though she is using me just for attention/back up in case things with her boy friend don't work out. I on the other hand struggle deeply because, I want to do the things of God and love her unconditionally without expectation, and not even focus on a relationship, but my internal fleshly desires want something more and its really confusing/tearing me up inside. I constantly feel like there are things unsaid between us, and I am afraid to be completely honest with her as I fear that I will ruin what we have or what God is using me for in her life. At the root, I know that the only relationship I require is in Christ, but I am struggling deeply and could use some wise interpretations as to what is occurring. Thank you. 





























 nice touch with the wine at the end 




 So like, before humans, God created Angels. They were his servants and Lucifer was born the greatest of all. He was born perfect, given consciousness directly in the presence of perfection and radiant light (God). Over time, Lucifer became jealous of God receiving all the glory and, being so powerful, deceived himself that he too could be Lord over all - Higher than God. Which is just logically an impossibility. That's like a a character in a story believing they could be greater than the person that wrote them into existence. Anyway, having once deceived himself, Lucifer convinced 1/3 of God's Angels to join his army and rebel against God. God then cast the Angel's out of his highest chambers of Heaven, banishing them. After this, at some point in space and time, God created humans. Satan then proceeded to deceive humans into disobeying God, making them believe God was trying to hold them back from becoming "like God" if they obtained the knowledge of good and evil. This is called Sin - disobeying God. Ever since the *fall of man*, and progressively throughout history, the fallen angels and demonic forces have existed within and out of our realm (spiritually), affecting us directly and indirectly. Whether that be through temptation or various other methods such as possession, demons have had a negative effect on our world. Fortunately, through the power of prayer, we have been given authority through the Holy Spirit of God and the authoritative name of Jesus to command these spirits to have no power over others and ourselves. This is all due to the faith that we have in God through Jesus Christ and His sacrifice for our Sins. This brings terrible anguish to Lucifer (Satan), as he knows his fate has long since been sealed and doesn't want anyone to know the power that can found through the love of Yeshua (Jesus).

Ps - it's just so freeing to humble oneself before God and embrace the forgiveness that Jesus offers. Once someone accepts that love and knows their name is written in the book of Life for eternity, God will shape you into the Christ-like individual He originally intended you to be. Salvation happens in a moment, Sanctification occurs over a life time. 




 becuz who cares about iOS games? u should go make one, who knows, you might make a billion dollhairs! 




 His *Seven Swans* album is definitely the most Biblically inspired, but his music is so varied I wouldn't say it falls under the category of Christian. Rather, he is a Christian who makes beautiful music and, at times, pulls those themes into his lyrics. *Illinois* is for sure his most popular album but I consider them all very enjoyable. 

also, rel4ted to prayer - There is authority over  the spiritual forces in the name of Jesus, Yeshua. As in, authority over all spiritual beings has been given to him by the will of God (the author of all life). "12 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places." So, when you pray, pray that the spiritual forces that are not of Christ be bound and cast away *in the name of Jesus - Amen* (Truth) - There's a lot of supernatural things going on in our natural perspective that we don't even realize. Thankfully, we have our Lord to guide us through.

 People are deceived, people think religion belongs in what our United States has turned politics into. It's all for show and the show has created a culture where if you affiliate with A religion, you should stand by B candidate. That's an idiotic and closed off mindset. Most likely, those politicians care more about their deep pockets than pleasing Christ. And the elections are blatantly rigged. There were scores of people supporting Ron Paul, but the establishment would not allow it. The media is owned. It IS propaganda. The world is ran by Satan and his human puppets. All we can do is look to Christ for freedom in the afterlife and present people with the truth of his gospel today.  




 Prayer is just demonstrating that you wish to communicate with the one who created you. Also, you pray, God moves. You pray and Angels are sent by the scores to lovingly attend to you or others. There is much power in prayer. An unseen spiritual power that begins with aligning our will with Christ through love and humility.

Ps- Listen to Sufjan Stevens.  




 I've just come to terms with the fact that, as a Christian, I have no right to be offended. Ever. It's just not part of my purpose for being. It also makes no sense to get offended by words because that's just empowering those words to have a deeper grasp on you.

 it's not like anyone would see that you "edit" it right? and usually they mark EDIT for really pointless edits. 




 quit forcing me to watch your god damn PYRAMIDS! 




 its like a SlugCat that, much like the other creatures in the post-apocalyptic world, have adapted to hibernating for extended periods of time until the need to hunt for food becomes necessary. It's body type extends to the physical gameplay, allowing for serpentine and fluid movements through the tight, industrial environment. I'm just excited, because the combat looks non-repetitive and generally fun.  









 lol i always appreciate a cartoon with good artwork, established character relationships, comedy and self awareness. This show might have a slow start to its first season, but will definitely have some backing here before the 2nd season or once it hits netflix. at least i hope so.

 lol "a douchbag comment". you act as if tho you've never been on the internet before. What's your AIM screen name? 




 w/evs. didn't seem intentional. seemed more reflexive than anything. Their biggest fine is not making the super bowl, end of story. 




 like it matters to you at all. We should make all internet people in charge of blindly fining players.

 "my father just died. Please...someone take a picture of me so I can post it on Reddit" 




 [yes is it](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7Bqob-weFk) 




 I mean, how am I, as the viewer, suppose to be informed on a topic when characters such as Piers Morgan and Nancy Grace never allow their guest to get a single word out other than their opening statements.  




 never watched the show. Can't relate. Downvote  




 You "got lost"? 




 Prof. Stuntman 




 thanks man. thank you very much. Christ bless 




 I want to stop fapping. I've tried. Made it the most 18 days. I've prayed and asked for the temptations to leave me. I've fought through it many times before, but the day to day just never ends. I want to "repent" of this Sin, but God, it's so hard to go through this everyday. And I legitimately see no end in site. I could go a year, two years, 50 years down the road, and then do it again and maybe my anxiety is unwarranted but i really could use some insightful christians to chime in on this subject and God's forgiveness. It just worries me, ya know.   




 not the entirety, but at times in the manner in which is turns everything into a religious show and a step by step process than really the breakdown and confession of the heart to forgiveness. I didn't post that to offend anyone, it's not aimed at you who trust Christ with your heart. The question is meant to expand the thought behind Establishment Sized Religion and how at times, it creates this culture of worrying more of the superficial than a relationship with God.

 anyone else feel like Catholicism is modern day pharisee? 




 WARNING: The following comment section you are about to read is filled with inside jokes and circlejerking that no self-righteous human would allow to pollute their screen for longer than it requires to click the red X in upper right hand corner. You've been warned. 




 I wish someone would post a long thing about the power of Prayer cuz it seems to be pretty important. 




 1.) God punished them for disobeying his direct command, they were not ignorant to disobedience. Then they tried to hide from God. Adam also tried to put the blame solely on Eve, as she was deceived by the Serpent initially.

2.) The Original Sin that occurred that day befell Mankind and Sin cursed their species (and World), not Lucifer - Lucifer is an Angel who committed his own Sin long before by rebelling against God in separate context and as an Angel born into knowledge and presence of perfection. 




 Excalibur!  




 Worthy post indeed! Though, this is an important en devour that we're all embarking on together, it's important to poke fun at the overall reality of the situation.  




 haha 









 Now I CAN'T WAIT to see devil due.............*fart noise* 




 Exactly! i went 18 days using nofap and prayer through christ and I felt amazing! unfortuantely, i fell again, and that stinks. But never give up! Go loves us, forgives us, and wants us to be the best we can for Him! 




 (bullet note) Be Titan Fall 




 I felt the support. 




 Some of you may be aware of this subreddit already. [/r/NoFap](http://www.reddit.com/r/nofap) is a great support Reddit assisting those with the desire to turn away from pornography and alter the way they perceive sexuality. There is even a day counting badge to mark how many days it has been since a previous relapse or failure. I'm submitting this as this is one my many sins that I struggle with and pray Christ conquers immediately in my life. There's a lot of love in that subreddit, similar to this one. Surround yourself with love and you will overflow with love.  




 what's a miser? 




 Fuck your video games! Jk 




 thaat is cool 




 k 




 mmm, i donno, i've heard it a few places and i'm too lazy to go hunt them down.  




 that is....photo realistic. Tell me how you got so good? i want your whole story if you don't mind.  




 Certain societies mention the existence of giants, such as in Genesis 6 of the Bible. There are also reported giant human like bones that are reported to be kept in the Smithsonian. Any thoughts related to their possible existence?  




 Assassin's Creed: Black Flag was releasing around the same time, so they also didn't want to take sales away from themselves.  




 How long did you go without PMO before you found your wife? What were the struggles like? Did you feel that the lack of this Sin in your life led you to more opportunities to meet a life partner through Christ? Now that you've met your partner and are sexually active with them, do you still feel the temptation of pornography or are your passions quelled by the love of God and your wife? Any other input here is very welcome. Thank you. God bless.  




 Romans 2:  12-16

This might shed some perspective. But I suppose this is still up to interpretation. 

12 All who sin apart from the law will also perish apart from the law, and all who sin under the law will be judged by the law. 13 For it is not those who hear the law who are righteous in Gods sight, but it is those who obey the law who will be declared righteous. 14 (Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature things required by the law, they are a law for themselves, even though they do not have the law. 15 They show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts sometimes accusing them and at other times even defending them.) 16 This will take place on the day when God judges peoples secrets through Jesus Christ, as my gospel declares. 




 wowza 




 all those bird wings make the hipsters go buckwild  




 what kinda game is it?
 




 i don't agree with the title. Reddit is always poopin their pants over natural  phenomenon as if some scientist in a lab created this formation. 




 I work night shift, don't sleep much, workout quite a bit, and have been sick lately. I just found out I have Shingles ( a reemergence of the chicken pox virus when your body's immune system is compromised). Please pray that this will pass, i'm currently taking anti virals). i'm 23 and I've found out that if you get shingles before the age of 50, you have a 74% chance of having a stroke in your life. So that's got me worried as well.   




 maybe they want to do a natural birth? We will pray for that the labor pains will come and pass friend. 




 they killed JoePa too. Radon 80 in his home. ten times the normal limit.  




 thnx will check it out 









 blacklist 




 i just can't comprehend how someone can keep track of sooo much detail in one single image. too much for my simple mind, i gess 




 i just don't understand how anyone could outright NOT support snowden and be able to sleep at night. The news woman just seems like such a tool. How can anyone be that way? How can you lie to your self for so long and not change.  




 yeah, that 




 outright gayest movie of the year - why reddit? why?....oh, right. This was planted by some hollywood shill trying to promote their lackluster garbage.  




 yeah, killing people is just great 




 not sure why pointing out your lack of religiousness, but whatevs. At least I know now so i can't JUDGE you 




 IN THE VOICE THAT'S IN MY HEAD WHEN I SEE CAPITAL LETTERS!

Edit: Fuck you for the gold :) 




 I'm a Christian and every day I would go to bed full of guilty related to PMO. It would even convince myself at times that I wasn't saved and that Christ's sacrifice wasn't sufficient. I knew this was a lie and I also knew the satisfaction I thought I could find in PMO was a lie as well - yet I bought into it like a slave to my body. God has blessed me with another day away from guilt and, praise Jesus, it feels good. It feels good to look to God without a contrived blemish looming over my soul. There are many other sin's that I am also dealing with in my life, as well, but Lord it is uplifting to be free of this one. God bless all for freedom from sin. Sanctification. :)  




 quaid, start the reactor 









 great response to his great response.  




 sounds like exactly what some reviewers have spewed. Think yourself friend. it is a game.

 it's time to do something!...but first, to the grocery store 









 I've seen CG trailers for games such as Diablo 3 and they look [Beautiful](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSpLVYHOkvM). I've begun to ask myself, with the over saturation of Pixar copycats flooding the limelight (aimed primarily at children), why haven't there been more full length animated feature films that are of higher quality, such as [Final Fantasy: Spirits Within](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaI7ZPA9I1c)? With such a large market of teens and young adults who watch Japanese Anime, why haven't there been more attempts by Western culture to tap into this mature audience? 




 This is just unbelievable. I wonder if the fraudsters will be dealt with in time or if once this fixes (if it fixes), nothing will be done...well, at least we have a roof over our heads and food in our bellies. Not to dapper down this obvious injustice.  




 I've been noticing my urethra dribbles
Semen like urine after
Voiding. Am I the only one? Lol 




 ahhh man.....mmm, well.... 




 good point 




 what can one do? 




 If I wanted Batteries, I'd go to Radio Shack 




 me three! 




 Do you think 9/11 was an inside job? I do. I personally feel that our country's war efforts are no different than that of Nazi Germany in the 1940s. [Some thoughts](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvg_rv3B_wU) 




 use good act as means to also make more money for movie? That's just evil.  




 certainly not a timeless show. just seems to have the most traction 




 so essentially everyone else but jesus should not look at porn? 




 the creation of man and the creation a day time talk show host both have their origins founded in Genesis  




 it also repeats a joke til it's all the way down your esophagus 




 You will never redeem yourself as the love of God extends as a gift that has redeemed you in full through the second you choose to accept His son Jesus and his sacrifice. It is already completed and you can rest easy knowing how much grace, love and mercy rests on your spirit now. Go in peace and continue to be sanctified by the blessings of The Lord in all it's forms. 




 I kept reading that as Oprah.  




 I don't see how his comments on porn being okay stil maintain his purity. 




 instead of upvoting you, I down voted you and wrote this comment instead. Does that tickle your twacker just the same? 




 Their cartoons are funny 




 maybe just measured in visible light.  In the case of reflective energy, it would follow projection qualities. Still have to consider matter as well.  




 Your life could end any day. Make sure you're right with Yeshua.  




 Valid point. Counter point. Who gives a shit? 




 Some people, just want to watch the world...burn 




 have u met the Rothschilds?  




 Unbelievable.  




 Why hasn't a crazed, suicidal,  transient trillionaire done the unspeakable and sent a spacecraft to destroy Earth's one single satellite? Seems like the best possible terrorist plot since Benghazi, yeah? 









 "how much money would it take to get you to do 9/11 part 2 for me?" 




 I've met a lot of Catholics who tend to stray away from Christ due to the contradicting doctrine of Catholicism. I don't, for certain, know if this plays into your issue - but if so, I'd be more than happy to answer any questions in PM and would highly suggest finding a non-denominational church that sticks directly to the Bible. Just my thoughts. Once again, not trying to put down Catholicism, just stating what I've noticed. I'll pray for you, friend.  














 ya blew it 




 Yeah, like my mom accidentally became pregnant with me with a guy who didn't love her, and wanted her to have an abortion, but she couldn't live with herself if she did and here I am! I'm not the best Christian ever, but I AM loved by God and happy he gave me the mercies of life and the opportunity to help others to Yeshua. :) 




 I wish that guy was still in the background. In your shower perhaps? 




 Pretty good for a beginner. O0o-_-o0O 




 Hmm, maybe? 




 not sure, who's the mod? Alert them of this. Then they'll send out a subreddit message letting everyone know it's banned and then when we see this imgur pictures, we can report them and remove them before they confuse people more.  




 Maybe we should ban posting random Imgur pictures with text? 




 Maybe we should ban posting random Imgur pictures with text? 




 Not to be devil's advocate, but maybe 9/11 was planned more than a week before.  




 Buncha freakin' Dick Tracys over here 




 I too love the natural phenomena of our Universe.

 5 people might not believe this. But hey,  I believe this. I believe in the saving power of Jesus Christ. Unfortunately to get to the top in this world you must sell your soul to the devil.  









 I've been depressed before and I'm depressed right now (it's Winter), but I've come to the conclusion that it's a normal aspect of life. My question is, if human beings have gone untold millennium without psyche medication to treat depression in the past, what makes an issue that appears to be a natural part of life a valid clinical illness within the last 50 years? 









 Sorry, I drive a Cummins

 




 You should put *your* Panthiez-On 




 Thank you for quoting my previous lengthy passage so I wasn't left out of context. Allow me to further elaborate. Because it's fucking gay as shit!  




 college is worthless 




 It's even more odd when someone starts clapping and you can tell it just naturally prompts others to do so out of learned behavior. Fuck Hunger Games. 




 that's from the movie! holy fu- 









 no one fucking asked you! 




 But you are reinforcing my perspective with your own confirmation bias. Rather than answering the question with neutrality, you, similar to the dogmatic characters you've just described, have answered a question on world views by attempting to sell me your own world view. It would appear it's cyclical no matter what side you take. The question then arises, is there a side to take?  




 Whether someone believes theology, ideals, or even the theory of evolution - Why do people claw teeth and nail to impart their understanding of the world upon you? 




 And my axe! 














 Those are chem trails me friend

 How do you activate them? AAA Batteries?

 who the hell says burned anymore? 




 no serious, well i guess only Nicko McBrain is Christian. But i remember someone like alice cooper saying that they used their heavy art style to reach a younger audience for christ 




 I think Iron Maiden is Christian

 Yeah same with freakin Christian rock, why do we always have to sing, "my god is an awesome god" in church and not some sweet ass Iron and Wine

 This is beautiful. A definite step forward in the sword combat genre. I love physics in games and you can definitely feel them just by watching. Someone should repost this with a catchier title so more can catch a glimpse of this immediate classic.  




 So the powers have relocated? Are these powers eternal? 




 take it to the media. immediately. If you find an outlet that'll back you, they can help convince the populace of the need for justice and possibly change
