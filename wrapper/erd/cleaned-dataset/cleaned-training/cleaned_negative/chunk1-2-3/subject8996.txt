 I am out of shape and not buff like Ken. If i had him flattened out with both arms around his neck I would have finished him no doubt. I don't care if Ken is over the hill. There is no way he shouldn't have finished that in that position. I don't buy it. 




 what about old man strength? and the massive  of cycle of steroids Ken just did?  




 The ease with which Kimbo got up should be convincing enough if Ken's inability to finish was not.  




 worse! it was fixed 




 because ken wasn't actually trying to submit him 




 because it was 




 I think so. 




 Ken lost that on purpose! **FIX**

 Ken is the most fake person in MMA. Kimbo can't even walk, but I am rooting for him to KO Ken.  









 I honestly think Jimmy might take the job and never give it back, just like Tom did.  









 for someone who weighs that much? it's short 




 that's essentially the same question 
 




 A very mediocre card.

 i don't remember all of those qb's being that good back then, but then again i was a kid 




 they actually find the guys they are to groom to be Olympians at much younger ages than that

you're right, we do have to incentivize it, both monetarily and with shine 




 Could crossfit maybe make an impact?  




 that sounds about right 




 For the masses, yes it kind of does.  




 I think you have identified the cause of the problem. 




 Ilya is only 5'9. 




 and what happens when all of these guys get old and retire and none of them are around in 2020? :'( 

we can't all be andrew luck fans, can we? 




 Other countries have lifters who are in the olympics at 19 or 20, and our lifters aren't lifting anywhere in the same universe as them. Why are these tiny nobody countries, no offense  I just mean in terms of population and work presence, putting elite lifters up there and we're not? Even North Korea is kicking our butts. North Korea! The country we make fun of all the time and is starving to death. 




 The rest of the world plays basketball too, right?

 I got to see Moon towards the end of his career. He was special. 









 We have our three major sports and hockey as a 4th major regional sport. Soccer isn't on the radar. We did just beat Germany though, so the future is bright.  




 thanks, he's been right about so much! 




 ah, thanks 




 It bothers me that the Chinese dominate. I respect their athletes, but I wish we'd value weight lifting.

 You're rihgt, there could have been many different motives, but cccam's razor = hate crime 




 how is it unethical? it was a hate crime, it is relevant  




 Because America is run by corporations and special interests like the NRA (national rifle assocation). They own about 95% of all politicians. They don't serve the interests of the citizenry. Also, our values are defunct. We have mass shootings all the time, but people value extreme gun rights more than they do people's lives. This is why it's a lot easier to purchase a gun than it is to vote. 




 right now 




 about what? like which particular bit of his are you referring to? i'm genuinely curious  




 i'm not caught up on the american lifting scene, hence my question 




 Not sarcasm. We do though if you consider all the sports.  




 u want sugar coating?  




 How is it disgusting? Isn't that exactly what happened? 
 




 who? 




 Thanks. So, we have pretty much nothing? :( 




 what about the women? anyone there worth keeping an eye on?

 Would we not be hearing about how everyone is violating her? So, why does it seem that nobody realizes James  is being violated?  












































 Mayweather has already defeated Cotto, Alvarez, and Pacquiao. Amir Khan appears beneath his level. 

Why not put Golovkin in front of Mayweather and watch what he can do? Beating an undefeated, soon to be 20 knockouts in a row, and larger fighter would be the most difficult challenge of his apparent options, and if he wins, it would solidify his position as TBE. 

**Money** vs **GGG** 
























 HBO does with boxing. It gives more information to the viewer and improves the viewing experience.  The UFC added vegas odds, so why not make this change?  














 My school offered an unsubsidized loan that covers only half of my tuition. I think I have reached the 57.5k total limit. I have to find the rest of the tuition, a few thousand in nursing school fees, books, etc. I'm male. I have a previous bachelors degree in a social science. 90% of the 57.5k is from nursing school. A $10-15/hr job probably won't cut it.  I could use some realistic ideas. Nothing illegal.

 Fastest 40? Most bench press reps? Best vertical? Best performance at position drills. Etc. 














 Great engines, horrible name. I get it, they are economical and they give a boost, but could Ford not come up with a more attractive name for their turbocharged engines? "Eco" sounds weak and un-American.  

















































 The Lakers 2015 first round pick of course.  Top 5 protected in 2015, top 3 protected in 2016/7, unprotected in 2018.

Maybe throw in the Suns 2015 first round pick? 


Would the sixers be interested in Goran Dragic and or Gerald Green?  














 Assuming Jose is still the Champ at the time. Would this date be perfect?  


































 thanks 




 They'll recycle it, I'm sure of it. And Hillary's army hasn't even got started yet.  




 what are you doing to Silva's thumb? 




 is there a comprehensive list of where Sanders will be? I'd like to go if he comes to my hometown 




 They lost their coach and many players. Their QB isn't playing up to expectations. The three teams in their division are better.  




 did someone play my mix tape?  




 a lot can happen from now and next november  




 while it's reaching to take something out of context that he wrote before most of us were even born, I'm sure it won't stop Hillary's Pac's from using it 




 If he wins Iowa and New Hampshire his chances become real. 




 He doesn't have the same mechanics bruh! It's apples and oranges.

Just look at their footwork and releases.  




 He's pure. The only thing I have heard negative about him so far is he wrote some erotica like 40 something years ago. When they try to catch him by calling him a socialist or wanting to raise taxes etc, he doubles down on it and wins. 














 For a a short QB they won't pay more than Cam Newton? you're overpaying 




 The best I can do is WR Jaron Brown and a second round pick.  




 it's not the colbert report, it's stephen colbert 




 it's not the colbert report, it's stephen colbert 














 It's a typo. They listed him at [6'7](http://search.draftexpress.com/profile/Anthony-Brown-6222/), which means they rounded up from 6'6 1/2. If he was 6'8 1/2 with shoes they would have listed him at 6'9. 














 It would be funny if Trump got the nomination by accident.  




 I'd enjoy that fight.

 Jinx. Now he's going to LA.  




 Jalen Rose was turrible.  




 The Lakers signing somebody, be it Gasol or Aldridge or somebody else. 




 Or San Antonio?  




 Is it just me or does it appear that 4/5 of these candidates just want to make a name for themselves more than actually planning to win the nomination?  














 I actually think he'll be an all-star in a few years.  




 Lakers?  




 There's substantive issues to take with Clinton, but they focus on nonsense.  



















 Please let him be the Republican nominee!  




 What if my religion is against straight marriage? I want to impose my values on everyone! No more straight marriages!  









 You're right. She could have grown. She should embrace that angle and tell how republicans they can do the same.  




 Totally. You can't use your religion to impose your morality on other people. What if my religion is for gay marriage? Your religion can't impose its  values on laws of the land over mine.  




 Hillary used to say marriage is between a man and a woman. But now apparently she's LGBT supporter #1. 

She's an opportunist.  



















 We are unfortunately the minority.  




 Why not strip Aldo? Make it so only Conor can become the champ if he wins.  


































 Stop subjecting yourself to fox news and stop with the CAPS. 




 You don't understand what fascism is. Having health insurance is tyranny? So, is having to have car insurance tyranny too?  














 Consideration segregation ended decades ago, I think they can let go of their segregation flag.  









 what happens if Aldo doesn't make weight but Conor does?  




 The Suns not making any moves and drafting another player who will ride the bench. 














 I'm gonna say no to 99% of the population in regards to your question.

 God, I hate Ellie as a Suns fan.  




 The protesters were on the money. He knows he has 0 chance of winning. He just wants to get his name out there for future jobs like lobbying or Fox News.

 Morris twins, 13th pick, and a 2017 Miami Heat first round pick.  




 noooo 









 I heard a lot of negative hype about Amare before the draft. Once he started playing summer league, I knew he was going to be d dominant rookie. He was.  




 me? please don't associate me with bjpenn dot com, it's like the worst website in the history of websites, it is the leach of mma websites 

I love BJ, but his website is appallingly bad 














 haha! 




 "great"


hahaha, nah, I'm good 









 let's hope they use this video in the few debates there will be 




 how about that play button that makes it look like a video? but it's just a link

i wish websites could get cancer 




 BJPenn dot come will surely clickbait it 




 That's a great young man.  




 I'd rather have him Congress than as a VP that Hillary will shove off to the side while she's taking her husband's advice.  




 Bernie will have to attract more minorities and women in order to have a chance at pulling off the great upset.

 i'm still waiting in case anyone wants to give me an example where people live without taxation  




 So, please educate me where on earth there is a place a person can live without taxation? I'll wait. 




 Don't be so small minded. There are some things we need to do collectively.  









 I'll be voting for him 100% and I'm talking to many people I know and trying to get their vote too.  









 really? how do you figure? i think a narrow field would help her challengers because the non-hillary votes are split up among fewer candidates  









 Love Makwan, but he isn't ready. He should try beating someone with a wikipedia page first.  




 Maybe he missed every ethics meeting ever?  




 If the ACA unravels million of people would stand to lose health insurance. Many of them would be in red states. I think if Republicans get their way on defeating the ACA, it will assure Democrats take the Presidency and both the House and Senate.  




 Sanders is the only moral candidate.  




 You realize the Bush administration set us on a death spiral and the Obama administration brought us back, right? Sanders would bring up the middle class. You know what people in the bottom 50% do with money? They spend it. His rebuilding infrastructure alone would do wonders for the economy. Millions of new jobs and many positive externalities.  




 Paul wants a flat tax. Neither will happen, unless congress goes pure red or pure blue. Does this take away from the fact that Sanders would be the best President possible for 99% of Americans?  









 Len is garbage. Pick 13 is likely garbage. The two other picks are likely not worth much either. Bledsoe is all we'd really be giving up. 




 Bledsoe, Len, pick 13, 2016 first round pick, 2017 Heat pick. 

Interested?

 all you gotta do is copy paste the top paragraph in google and go to the story that way and no pay wall

 Because they are owned by the same corporations that own Clinton and Bush.  




 Granted, we don't have deep pockets like Hillary's banks, but we average like $40 and there are more of us every day. I'm ready to vote for him in the primary. 




 It says gymnasium, not oven. 




 His brother is a politician in England :) 




 You should reconsider your views on socialism. Learn more about it. 




 What if I told you Sanders's positions are aligned with the public more than Paul's was? And even more than all the so called mainstream aka corporately owned candidates?  




 I was wondering where the photonic cannon was in the finale against the borg. 














 why? if he's performing no reason he can't go another term 




 he wrote that think like 40 years ago, he's old, he too far left, etc etc BS 
























 So you get the far superior player and a pick? Good lucking signing Aldridge and Love.  




 Other Suns fans will have different opinions, but I agree with you and I think the front office is fickle.  














 It appears he's on the block and Phoenix will take a half decent offer because they're eager to unload him. What are possible trades and what is the best Phoenix could do?  




 Because I don't have to buy food from the one grocery store you go to. I don't have to chicken with broccoli to live. I can substitute ramen and cans of tuna and live off of that. But if I need a particular procedure, what choice do I have? I think you should reconsider.

We really don't have to reinvent the wheel. We have medicare and we can use that as our base. Just look at every other developed country. There's not that much mystery. Single payer would be better.  




 These are great questions!!! Let's hope we hear them in the debates.  









 oh, this is making me remember stats 




 why? 









 The markets of supermarkets and heatlhcare are very different! If I don't buy Safeway's overpriced  produce, I'm not going to die. I have many other options to buy groceries. I can even grow some food myself. Now, what happens if I need medical care? The inelastic demand curve says I have buy the product no matter how much everyone is going to rip me off. If there was medicare for everyone the government can bring down prices drastically just like every other country does. That is the power of a single provider.  




 [God wills it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ez6wfJWVCeI), Sanders will win! 



















 this is a win for democracy and Americans  




 It never is to get progress. It can be done though. 




 which website is giving those odds? 




 it makes sense 




 exactly 














 Let's not confuse the 2% who are part of organization with those that support it. [42%](http://pnhp.org/blog/2009/04/03/how-many-doctors-support-single-payer/) support it according to one source. With the implementation of the ACA and it's success, those numbers could be even higher if a survey was conducted now. 




 This is a great ruling! It gives power to the people rather than politicians.  



















 Just when we think we're becoming more progressive and humane as  a country, we're reminded that we still execute people. We have a long way to go. 









 Great observations, it definitely would be a huge plus for business. 

[Many doctors](http://www.pnhp.org/) are for single payer FYI. 

Fuck insurance companies. 

Fuck politicians.  




 the merc s class assure me they aren't 




 That's called true love. 




 no, that's not for us, we prefer paying a lot more than you and getting less care and paying a lot more for procedure sand medications cause 'Murica  




 GGG should start talking up Floyd as much as possible like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGIIleYLpRY) 




 they attempt to draw parallels with mainstream sports to imply their product is mainstream too 




 great quality videos!

 Sanders has a 11/1 hance according to vegas. I think you're very optimistic if you think you have a 1 in 11 chance of dating her. 




 Free agents don't want to play for Sarver.  




 she seems like a fun chick unless you're trying to [sleep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDEqaAV5ZSc) 




 A little bit, but not like for profit medicine.  




 He's not repealing the law. He's trying to add something better. 




 Why doesn't he sit out until they pay him? If he's only making 1.5m it seems like it's worth it. 




 Yes for the rich it's the best. For your average American it is not. 




 He **did not** fight for the public option. He gave it up faster than girl on prom night.  




 He is. Let go of conventional thinking. 



















 government actually is more efficient FYI 




 Jesus? Who's that? Never heard of him.  




 Yes, I can see it now. Can we put you out of business? No, you wouldn't like that? You'd prefer to keep charging twice as much as you need to? Ok.  




 I'm sorry. 




 you could maybe get a new job?  









 I think it could show confidence and leadership if one of the republicans declared it. Somebody has to set themselves apart. 




 republicans? lol 




 You  have to at least try even if it's going to fail at first. Obama could have set a bridge for it if he delivered the public option that he promised. 




 Wait, what? doctors can barely make a middle class living? do you know doctors? because all the doctors I have come across and know are making a ton of money

I'm totally for abolishing for profit healthcare and pharm though 




 Jewish carpenter who works for the poor and those in greatest need? Where have I heard that before? 




 Some doctors are greedy pigs. Some doctors actually know how to use medicare to make a lot of money. If everyone was insured they would get care from their PCP instead of waiting to get seriously kill and go to the ER.  




 When there is one giant insurer they set the price. They tell companies what they will pay and they make them compete. It lowers the prices significantly! We have so many other countries that prove this. It's why things costs so much more in America. 

Single payer will reduce costs.  




 If anyone is peacocking, it's Trump or maybe Jindal. Sanders is realizing his goals. 




 You know that medicare currently sets the prices, right?
 




 And the high prices due to inelastic demand is immoral.  




 Did they say it though? 




 Obviously private insurance companies would be **-**, but the money saved from their profits and administrative costs would be a **net gain** for the economy.  




 that's another monster 




 Yes, govt is the insurance company just like they are for medicare and for vets. It doesn't stop you from purchasing anything though. 




 [like this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Health_Care_Act) 









 I can count. You can't be more than 100% sure. If you say anything more it means you're lying.  




 Fisher was a role player. Curry lead his team.  




 he has mad cardio too bruh 




 but the other candidates don't

hillary doesn't 




 considering we pay double to triple what other european countries pay while providing inferior care to those european countries, I think we could use a change 




 that's not nice 




 Whenever someone says they're over 100% sure they're wrong.

 How many titles  does CP3 have? 




 that would be dope! 




 You heard me. He gets along better with his teammates and plays better with them than CP3. 




 Amare his rookie year. Was destroying everyone!

 background checks for sure 









 Curry. Better shooter and better teammate.  




 She won't directly answer the question to not seem like she's taking anything for granted. She'll say something about her supporters and her mission etc etc. 




 Luck you! 




 Yes we do. It shows that his momentum and support is large everywhere he goes.  




 I think they have more empathy but more in touch? That's definitely arguable. Clintons make more in one month than Bernie's net worth. 




 You're  right. For profit is immoral and inefficient.  




 You haven't heard others saying it now, have you? 




 What kind of odds are you giving me? 




 You are not as you are born. You are as you make yourself and as you live your life. Just look at Jindal. 

Same here, I'll support the Democratic nominee. I won't be excited about it though. Hillary is a corporate democrat. 




 Not quite a solid argument there bud. 














 I'll be excited when I see Bernie leading Hillary in a poll. 




 I'm sure he knows this. He's pretty busy. I think you have to be strategic where you go and in what order.  














 You're right, his supporters currently are almost exclusively white. That will change. There is no other candidate that matches up to Bernie in terms of record or policies that support minorities.

 legally though?  




 I think a lot of the west coast and other parts of the country would love to see him in person. 




 It is Hillary's to lose. And there is a lot of time to lose it. 









 I think we need to get [Lenne Hardt to introduce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-wCXgS_dYE) Bernie. Some pyrotechnics wouldn't hurt either.  




 It's still early. We'll see how things start shaping up towards the end of the year. 




 Bernie cares about the environment and he won't sacrifice it to corporate overlords because he's not a puppet like all the republicans and Clinton.  




 His plugs are even worse than Trump's elaborate comb over, but at least he's super tall. It would definitely be a different dynamic if it were a three way race, but I think being the only alternative to Hildawg is working out for Bernie. 




 You're right. He and his campaign realize this though and they're working on it. Plus, early states create momentum.  














 if only i could bet legally on sports and whatnot in my state :/ 

but I can't, not even draftkings 




 People love Bernie too. 




 I saw him 11/1 at another site.  




 You got a time machine bruh? Because if you do, he's 11-1 right now and we can become very rich! 




 McCain had lapses and said questionable things. Sanders is sharp. 




 He's running as a Democrat. If he loses the primary, he's not running as a third party candidate. 




 No he's not :) 

About the same age as John McCain when he ran. And Sanders is healthy and sharp.  




 As an Atheist, no Yoel. I'm not going to go for Jesus. This is a secular country. Keep your religion to yourself.  




 I bet they pull a Jon Jones and delete that tweet.  




 You can thank God and such, but keep the proselytizing to yourself, especially when it is bigoted and not PC. And you can be sure this will blow up beyond MMA. When that happens, you can be sure he's suspended or cut. Whatever action the UFC decides to take, Romero brought that upon his self.  




 Without being political or talking about religion, let's just the Abrahamic religions are not tolerant of homosexuality. This is what happens when proselytizing goes wrong. 




 Will he get suspended or outright cut?  




 what did he say exactly? go for jesus not gay jesus? i couldn't understand him 




 all they need are headlines and soundbites

facts don't matter to the media
