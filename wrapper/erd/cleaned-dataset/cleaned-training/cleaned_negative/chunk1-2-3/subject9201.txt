 I thought it looked like [this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/12/The_Neverhood_-_box_art.jpg). 




 One thing about online play is it's very impersonal. It's less like going on a blind date, and more like hiring a hooker. They aren't going to ask you about your life unless you want them to, and even then, they probably don't care. [They are just single-serving friends.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/quotes?item=qt0479153) You don't have to worry about what they think, because the game will probably fall apart in a couple months, and you will never talk to them again. 




 I have four gunners and four blasters, but I never use more than three total in any list. It'd be fun to run all eight some time just for shits and giggles. 




 Minions. 'Cause bacon. 




 Trolls  CoC  Cryx  Cephalyx  Thornfall  Legion  Blindwater  Searforge  Pirates  non-Pirate/non-Dwarf Mercs  Cygnar  Circle Khador  Menoth  anyone I forgot Retribution = Skorne.

I'm not sure why, but I can't stand the look of Skorne or Ret.  




 [Here's](http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/2jd60t/songs_turned_into_story_arcs/) some stuff people said about this before if you want to see some more ideas. 




 What about Sheik? 




 If I'm the one deciding, it's rolling. If it's other people, it seems the decision is always to take the number, or max, or max+whateverittakestosaveasnowflake. 




 He clearly said a [galleon](https://quidleyandco.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/goldengalleonx578.jpg) of fuel. 




 That's what DMs are for. 




 The "retro" of retro-futurism means not current. I would say that 2012 is pretty current. We have retro-futurism for the 90s and early 2000s, it looks like [this](http://cdn-static.denofgeek.com/sites/denofgeek/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/the_matrix.jpg?itok=omHlubMU). The problem is, we haven't really gotten to the "future" of those things yet.

Basically, things from those times are just considered futurism, not retro-futurism. 




 I'll take a crack at this. 

Retro-futurism is less about the progression of time since the piece of media was created, and more about the change in mindset, worldview, and aesthetic from what originally spawned it. 
 




 It's a bit like masturbation. You only really want to do it if you don't have the time/money/charm to get the real thing. 




 Triple ick. Not only am I changing werewolf vulnerability, I think I'm going to stop using silver in my games.... and probably remove any from my house. 




 So, it kills werewolves because it's god-sperm? Ick. 




 I really hope Hero Forge doesn't become the "you should use Fate" of minis. 

While it is neat to be able to pick out different combinations of things for a mini, most of those combinations already exist in mini form, for a lot less money, and both less fragile and better to be painted (or repainted).  




 I actually mean it as both an insult and half a compliment. 

On the one hand, they should have taken the 4e rules and inserted them directly into a D D MMO without making a single change, and it probably would have been one of the greatest MMOs ever made. Instead they made Neverwinter, which was so half-assed, it was quarter-assed.

On the other hand, I have played so many rpgs, wargames, and board games, and yet none are as disappointing as 4e. Thing is, it's well designed. The problem is, it's only well designed *to be well designed*. Absolutely nothing it did translated to fun at the table for me. 




 I'm going to assume you've never played a wargame, and never actually talked to an older player. 

The first edition of D D was based on wargames. Older players were playing wargames before rpgs even existed. There are lots of really great wargames made into RPGs that don't play like 4e, and they literally just add skills checks to wargame rules.

4e is nothing like a wargame, and is everything like World of Warcraft the board game. 

Sad thing is, I am a lover of RPGs, wargames, board games, and World of Warcraft, and I still can't stand 4e. 




 I love to play tactical wargames. In fact, I've used tactical wargame rules to run rpgs. The original D D was based on a wargame. 

Saying 4e is like a tactical wargame hurts me to my very wargamey soul.

4e is like a complicated board game is soooooooooooo much more accurate, and it doesn't burn the flesh off my ears when I hear it. 




 A lot of people are recommending Stars Without Number and... that's because it's awesome. And free. Go check it out. 




 So meta... 




 Wtf do you think we are talking about? Lesser evil is evil. It's literally *part of the term*. Lesser evil. Lesser. Evil. Two things are evil, one is less evil. The first part of that statement means that both are evil because it explicitly states that it is evil. 

Let me know how the "But at least I didn't do ______, which is sooooo much worse." argument works out for you. 




 The United States commits evil acts all the time, and is the victor. Just because you win doesn't mean you get to change the nature of what evil is.

If I murder everyone in the world, is it not evil, since there is no one left to say otherwise?

Even after human beings go extinct, the evil that has been done, whether known by all or by none, will still be evil. 




 Chaotic Evil societies wouldn't have a problem with slaves. Sure, they don't have laws telling you you can own slaves, but they don't have laws telling you you can't either. They probably aren't going to have a system of laws and regulations on slavery, but Chaotic Evil people will keep as many slaves as they can keep under their control. 

It's less "I bought this slave, have the town guard bring him back" and more "You are going to work for me, and if you do well enough, I won't eat you today." 




 Just because a paladin wouldn't immediately start a revolution in a state where slavery was permitted doesn't mean he thinks it's okay. 




 Laws are always good, right? This on a topic about a game that specifically has Lawful Evil as a thing. 

Early America had slaves, and everyone was totally cool with it. It's not like they [fought a full-blown war with themselves about it or anything](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War). 

"The bible says it's okay, so it must not be evil". I'm going to catch flak for this, I'm sure, but the Judeo-christian god would be Lawful Neutral, at best. Read the crazy shit it says you should be doing in Leviticus. 

And I suppose you think Nazis were pretty okay, right? I mean, they didn't even break any laws.  




 Don't worry, they made an [entire edition of D D](http://www.amazon.com/Dungeons-Dragons-Core-Rulebook-Edition/dp/0786950633) based on WoW style gameplay. 




 What a strange name for a kid... parents must be nerds. 




 The first [Reaper Bones Kickstarter Vampire level set](http://www.reapermini.com/kickstarter) is on [eBay](http://www.ebay.com/itm/2012-BONES-VAMPIRE-SET-REAPER-MINIATURES-/311244114620?pt=Games_US hash=item4877984abc) all the time for about $250. That's about $1 per mini. 




 Now *that* word is ruined for me. Way to go.

*It puts the lotion in the basket* 




 The first isn't wrong, it's just less clear. The second isn't pointless at all.  Saying any of it is part of having a discussion about the merits of using a particular system.

Games aren't made utter shit just because there is a rule in it that sucks. What's your favorite system? I guarantee it has problems. I guess you absolutely never recommend it to anyone. Since it has problems, it's pointless to talk about how you like it anyway, and how you work around those problems, right? God forbid someone have fun in a way you don't approve of.

Jumping on people for not wording things exactly the way you want is pretty shitty. Wanting to argue semantics instead of having a polite conversation about things people are interested in is pretty shitty.  




 The $299.95 isn't for the limited edition variant cover version. It's for the pack of 5 books that a store can order, one of which will be a limited edition variant cover. Talk to you FLGS guy and see if they are getting it, and see if you can call dibs on the variant cover. It should cost the same as the normal books. 




 You know what bothers me? 

"There is no issue with ________ because of rule 0." 

and "I have no issue with ______ because of of rule 0." 

technically mean different things, but people can't just assume the person means the one that doesn't involve a logic argument and move on with their life.  




 I don't know... but the word "reflesh" is really freakin me out right now. 




 [Here you go.](http://icv2.com/articles/news/view/30589/iron-kingdoms-unleashed-corebook-scheduled) 




 It's a shame it's only in Polish. I've played Neuroshima Hex, and it was pretty interesting. I'd buy a ttrpg from them if it was in English. 




 I don't see where he said it was an RPG.

Having played it, I don't really know what the difference would be. Potato / potato. 




 This.

It's also worth noting that they designed the classes without expectation that players will have magic items. 




 I didn't realize women had "junk" up front. 




 I agree. Just plan the games to be shorter, and if everyone is still into it at the end (including you), just keep it going. 




 I gotta ask, how does Gamma World do more to encourage roleplaing than Iron Kingoms?

I agree, though, that it's probably perfect for OP. 
























 What *is* popularity? Does it accurately show the preferences of people who have been on rpggeek.com who were arsed enough to vote? Close enough. Does it accurately represent what rpgs are played most around the world? No. Does it accurately represent what rpgs people *want* to play around the world? No. Does it accurately represent how much money is being spent on each game? No. Does it accurately represent what games someone could expect to see being played if they walked in to a random gaming store? No. Does it accurately represent what you would see being played if you walked into a random gamer's house on game night? No. 

In fact, every single one of those questions would have a different ranking. All being "correct", and yet all being different, despite representing the same basic thing. Without a goal, the data has no meaning. With a goal, the data has a bias. Decide which way you want to be wrong. 

I can actually give you a *real* answer though. D D5e is doing really well, and is *mostly* replacing all other forms of D D for a large majority of people who like D D. Mostly because it is new, and is "good enough" to not piss people off. Hype isn't really a major driving force in its success. It is not better or worse than Dungeon World. They are also not mutually exclusive. There are people who like both, people who like one and not the other, and people who don't like either. None of those people are wrong. 




 I generally think these lists are garbage, and don't really think they represent anything accurately (I know way too much about data collection/interpretation). 

However, seeing Pathfinder all the way down at 33 brings a tear of joy to my eye, and so god bless this list for that. 




 Here are some of my favorites:

[Deadzone](http://www.manticgames.com/games/deadzone.html) (kickstarter for new stuff [here](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1744629938/deadzone-infestation-sci-fi-skirmish-game) ): Miniatures skirmish wargame. I'm not going to list all the wargames I like, but this one not only has a pretty low buy in, but also uses a pretty small table space (relatively), and has super cool terrain bits.

[Zombicide](http://zombicide.com/en/): Cooperative miniatures strategy game where you play as people trying to survive a zombie apocalypse. 

[Mars Attacks](http://www.manticgames.com/games/mars-attacks-the-miniatures-game.html): Miniatures game based on the movie (sorta). Can actually be combined with Deadzone, funnily enough.

[Netrunner](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/android-netrunner-the-card-game/): Cyberpunk card game. 




 Exactly what I thought when I saw it. I'd watch that movie though. 




 Each box is full of staples that you will most likely use in many lists for that army, and jacks/beasts that can be magnetized. 

I've been playing Warmachine for a few years, with an army of some size for at least half the factions, and these boxes are such a great deal that I have bought/pre-ordered every single one. For some of the boxes I already have some of the units (like bane thralls, gun mages, choir, etc), but the box is still a good deal even if I just threw those models in the garbage (except Cygnar, where it's only an okay deal if I throw the doubles in the garbage). If I can use two, I'm going to keep them, but a lot of them I'm going to give away to some people I'm trying to get into the hobby.

Keep in mind though, I got mine at about $97, so ymmv. I did the math though, and even if you are paying the full retail of $130, you are still getting a good deal (assuming you need the models). Cygnar is probably the least good deal (discount-wise), as you could buy everything that comes in the box individually (minus the mini-rulebook, another nice bonus to the box) for about $140 from somewhere like discountgamesstore. Skorne *was* probably the best (I don't even like Skorne and I had to have it). 




 I add Fate to just about every game I run. 5e is pretty easy. Anything true about a character works like an Aspect (all the things in their racial description and background, for instance), and just bump the number of Inspiration points they can have at a time to 3 (they are now Fate points, but you don't have to tell them that). Reward them like you would Fate points, and tell them they can use them to take advantage of "aspects" of their character. 

Games I've done this successfully with: Paranoia, Iron Kingdoms, Stars Without Number, Gamma World, Rogue Trader, D D5e, Shadowrun, and Numenera.

Funny thing is, I've never ran a Fate game on its own, and I haven't liked any of the Fate games I've played in. I technically don't like Fate by itself. Really I just hate the "well, how about you word it *this* way, that would make it a better Aspect" thing that happens, it makes you sound like an ass, and it makes people not used to that kind of game hate the game. Sometimes crappy aspects are perfectly fine, especially when you are just starting out. 




 I definitely start low and ramp up higher as the group gets used to my style of GMing (and the game system, if they are new to it). I would say I start in the 2-3 range, and end in the 7-10 range. It's a bigger range at the top, because I don't ever have just one option for success. 

1 group in 100 might do *everything* right, but most are going to have to make tough choices about what gets done well. Groups that don't care usually have everything go wrong, with maybe one thing working out in a way that isn't a complete disaster.  




 [Space bard in action.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRYNYb30nxU) 




 I started with Mercs (bought a full Searforge army right off the bat) and I don't regret it at all. I can't say it's for everyone, but it's served me well.  




 Models acquired this way will stare at their owner with judging eyes all the time. They also will make every win they have taste bitter with shame, and losses all the more crushing served with a side order of guilt. 




 A dark wash and some highlighting would really help bring out the details, but I love the color choices. 

I'm just kidding, she's four. Great job!

Thin your paints... or something. 




 I would have pegged the Prince of Persia as a GURPS man. And you think you know a person... 




 There is an official alternative option for initiative in the DMG that is basically this. I do it often in more narrative focused games. 




 Sounds like fun. 

I've been running games since 1996, and I still get nervous when I start a new campaign. You'll get past that and to the fun fast enough. 




 Best of luck to you. There is some serious hate for GMs for hire, which is crazy. I think it's great, and in fact, when I stop blowing all my money on miniatures, I might hit you up (don't hold your breath though, wargaming addiction is a tough habit to kick). 




 Not only is it not copyrightable, if it was, your idea would probably be taken. Dice have been around for thousands of years, and even just in the last decade there have been probably a thousand games with different dice mechanics. 

The good news? No one is going to steal your idea. Ideas are cheap, and common. Even the good ones. The work you put into an idea is what you sell, because that's what is worth something. 

Bad news: No one cares about your "unique" idea. There are thousands of people with dreams and ideas that think about how cool it is that they had this nifty idea. Very few actually put in the blood, sweat, tears, time, and financial backing to make those ideas into something that other people can appreciate. 

Best of luck to you though.

 I had an idea in middle school for running an rpg campaign where the races were different kinds of food. Human's were burgers, halflings were sliders, gnomes were hot dogs, orcs were bbq ribs, elves were I think tacos, dwarves were pizza, half-orcs were pulled pork sandwiches, and half-elves were burritos. Pretty sure it hasn't been done yet, and I'm pretty sure it was about 10 minutes before lunch time when I thought of it. Speaking of, is it too late for dinner, or too early for breakfast? 




 Yep. I haven't run a full game of it yet, but it has a pretty good "job" generator section that's pretty good. Made by the same people who made the most recent Firefly rpg, and it apparently uses the same engine. 




 I've never played the Payday games, but there is an [RPG based on the TV show Leverage](http://www.margaretweis.com/index.php/shop#!/~/product/id=9555048). 




 [Not helpful, but relevant.](http://oglaf.com/kingshaped/) 




 I'm just curious, in what way did you think it was limited? 




 *edit: My science is bad and I feel bad.  




 Utter rubbish. What textbook did you get that out of? One from the 70s? You might want to try a more recent one, one not written by racists.  




 I feel bad for non-American cultures when aliens get here firing lasers. They just won't know what hit'em. 




 My favorites: 

The Infinite Improbability Drive from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

The BTL or "Better Than Light" Drive from Spaceship Zero.

Warhammer40k's Warp (basically the same as Event Horizon).

The space travel from the Ender's Game series. This one is basically just a ship that travels really fast, but because it approaches the speed of light, time slows down for the people on the ship, but not for people who aren't traveling. Which means it seems like a 1 year trip to you, if you are the one travelling, but it might take you 20 years to get there.  




 [This](http://www.artplaymix.com/portfolio/paizo_hijinx-mag1.gif) was a thing. Might not be what you are looking for, but if you want to check it out, it's for sale [here](http://paizo.com/products/btpy7z7f?Dungeon-Issue-99-with-Polyhedron-158). 




 I just picked up the All-in-one box for Legion. I saw I have the option between the two Strider units, and I thought I'd see which I should assemble them as. I have zero other legion.

I'm looking to eventually get p/eAbsylonia, pLylyth, and eThagrosh if that helps.

*edit: Also, what's the best way to do 15pt using the All-in-One box? 




 It's just a starter adventure and pre-mades for the new Unleashed book. It's the same as what's in the adventure kit, except digital. Map tiles / minis not included.

 If only it was for something other than Pathfinder. 




 If they are souls in mechanikal bodies, with full human intelligence (something jacks don't really have), you might want to look at the Convergence of Cyriss Clockwork Vessel stuff for the IKRPG in No Quarter #48.  




 I was just thinking about this again today, and I think I'd settle for having a Searforge Junior Warcaster. Preferably female.

If she had 3 focus, she could run two bunnies and have 1 upkeep going. 




 [This is a great idea. I'm so glad I thought of it.](http://i.imgur.com/snLplqq.jpg) 




 If it's just paint by numbers, the person who said that must be able to do [this](http://www.coolminiornot.com/), right?

 Ooze wall is good. Crawling Ooze Wall sounds perfect to me.  




 Your second theory has been my theory since I first heard about this.

Every pusher in the world knows to make the first hit free. 
























 Bronze Age low fantasy? 




 do gritty near-future sci fi next. 




 Yep, that's pretty crunchy. 

What you can do, is play a one-shot in Fate, or AW/DW. Then when you go to Traveller, it'll feel plenty crunchy.

Fate is absolutely not crunchy enough for me. Every time I've played it, I've disliked it. However, I use the rules from Fate to lighten up more crunchy games, and I actually love some of the concepts in it.

If you are looking for crunchy, I highly recommend Iron Kingdoms RPG, or any of the Warhammer40k Roleplay games (my favorite is Rogue Trader, but it's definitely not everyone's favorite). Rogue Trader could actually probably serve you pretty well for whatever you were planning to do with Traveller, too. 




 I think Numenera is the crunchiest of the rules-light games. 

I add rules from Numenera to Fate Core to increase the level of crunch. And walnuts for chocolate chip cookies. 




 I am super curious as to what you normally play, and what you consider to be complex. 




 Warlock is a starting career, and you essentially take all your starting classes *at the same time*. A starting character Bloodweaver/Circle Warlock would start with an ARC of 2 unless you raise it with your stat increases. 




 I expect we will see these exact same boxes again. They used them to boost interest in the game and get people into new factions, and they will probably let that ride for a while. In a year or two, if they have a bit of a slump (or even if they suspect one), they will probably do another limited release of these same boxes. They don't need to do new stuff in the boxes because the majority of people didn't buy every box they would ever want, and it still presents the same value to new players. Also, these boxes were very much "core" lists, with almost no overlap with battleboxes.  




 If you can get a hold of one of the all-in-one army boxes, those are a great start. 




 The pyschologists probably noticed it right away. 




 I think that's a perfectly fine idea. 

If it was me (and I may do this if I buy him, since I run pirates all the time), I'd see if I could just cut his hat off, and sculpt a tricorn out of green stuff. Then you could just paint him with a "piratey" theme and he'd be good to go.

There's seriously as many ways to do it as there are people who could do it. 
 




 I'm going to second Iron Kingdoms. It can handle extremely tactical combat, and has probably the fastest combats of the rules heavy games out there. 

You can check it out for free [here](http://files.privateerpress.com/ironkingdoms/documents/adventures/IKRPG_Scenario_Fools_Rush_In.pdf) and [here](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/146332/Iron-Kingdoms-Unleashed-An-Introduction-to-Savagery).

 It's by far my favorite non-narrative style combat system. 




 Are you looking for a tournament legal conversion? If so, that's going to be hard to get it looking like the exclusive one, as you need 50%+ of the original model, and they are actually quite a bit different (the only thing that's really even similar is the gas mask and the grenades). 

Now, if you aren't worried about it being tourney legal, it's not at all hard to put a gas mask on a pirate mini and give him a few grenades.

It all depends on what you are looking for.

*edit: If all you are looking for is the normal gorman mini with a pirate hat, that's pretty easy to do. 




 I like them, but I prefer to get them randomly. 




 check out /r/LFG 

It's a subreddit specifically for finding games to play in, and it isn't half bad. 




 Technically you are both right. For the sake of the fact that he's the one who used the word first, based on his definition, your system is not balanced. There is nothing wrong with that if that's what you like. 

Some people think games need to be balanced in certain ways, others don't. Some people like point buy, some people like randomly rolled. It's just a preference thing.

Basically, there are two types of one-armed men. One type will insist you tie one of your hands behind your back to make it a fair fight (and will usually still bitch about fairness if they lose, and generally cry some more like a little baby). The other type will kick your ass with just his one arm, and be all the more of a badass for it.

Personally, I think the kind of balance he is talking about makes for a terrible game (D D4e, looking at you here). That kind of balance really only matters in competitive adversarial games. Which to me, aren't roleplaying games. GMs aren't the bad guy, they just decide what the bad guy does. The other players aren't your competition, they are your friends. Or at least, that's how I roll.

Your game sounds like fun, and already I'm interested in hearing more. 




 Or maybe a sword with, like, [a chainsaw along one edge](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/warhammer40k/images/2/2d/Titus_Chainsword.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130613180716). 




 Wow, someone beat me to an IKRPG recommendation. I'm impressed.

Here's some free quickstart guides for IKRPG: [here](http://files.privateerpress.com/ironkingdoms/documents/adventures/IKRPG_Scenario_Fools_Rush_In.pdf) and [here](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/146332/Iron-Kingdoms-Unleashed-An-Introduction-to-Savagery) 




 [This](http://privateerpress.com/iron-kingdoms/introduction-to-the-iron-kingdoms) is a pretty decent way to get started. Or if you are more of a visual learner [this](http://www.deviantart.com/browse/all/?q=warmachine+iron+kingdoms offset=0) or [this](https://www.google.com/search?q=warmachine+iron+kingdoms biw=1329 bih=927 source=lnms tbm=isch sa=X ei=vioxVfzAGc62yASj74DoCQ ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ) might be better. [This](http://ironkingdoms.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page) isn't terrible, but there's not much there. 




 Every game has it's problems. IKRPG wins out for me because of how fast combat goes in such a tactical crunchy-rules game.  




 I skipped any that had already been mentioned, especially if I don't have a lot of experience with them. Namely, hackmaster, rolemaster, and gurps. 




 You rang? 

I love complex games. I like having rules for everything, and then just ignoring them if I don't need them at the moment. 

[Iron Kingdoms RPG](http://privateerpress.com/iron-kingdoms/core-products/iron-kingdoms-core-rules) is a great complex game (quick start rules [here](http://files.privateerpress.com/ironkingdoms/documents/adventures/IKRPG_Scenario_Fools_Rush_In.pdf) and [here](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/146332/Iron-Kingdoms-Unleashed-An-Introduction-to-Savagery)). It is built from the Warmachine wargame rules (which was built from D D3e). When I run a fantasy game, I run IKRPG. One of the things that it does well over a lot of other complex games is that combat is still really quick (mostly because nothing lives past 2 or 3 rounds). It's a dynamic and deadly system that is great for people who love strategy who want a great fantasy game. Also, the new standalone expansion has probably the [best starter box of all time](http://privateerpress.com/iron-kingdoms/core-products/iron-kingdoms-unleashed-adventure-kit). 

Another great complex game is the **Warhammer40k Roleplay** series (*Dark Haresy II* is newest, though my favorite is still *Rogue Trader*). The WH40k universe is so rich and complex that it really needs a complex rules system to do it justice. Hundreds and hundreds of weapon and armor options, table after table after table of injury results, hundreds of spaceship options, dozens of character origin options, a robust skill list... there is enough crunch here to choke a heretic. It's a little rigid, and I have some home-rules that loosen it up a bit, but it also has the structure of a wargame for its roots, and combat is deliciously strategic, deadly, and lots of fun. Combats tend to be longer than IKRPG games, and that's something that is pretty common with complex games, but it's not horrible, and they are definitely fun and interesting combats, with lots of options. 

**Dungeons and Dragons** has two editions that I would count as complex, 3.5/PF and 4e. For me, they both have the same problem, and that is that combat takes too long, and gets pretty boring. There are other things I could say about them, but I'm not going to fight an Edition Wars battle here.

*Special mention*: There are several games that I actually don't think are very complex, but that are somewhat tricky to learn. Mostly you just need someone who already knows how to play to run it for you, but it's still enough to get mentioned.

**Eclipse Phase**: Great setting, strangely complex (and maybe just a smidge poorly organized) rules. Available for free, which means you can check it out before you invest.

new **Star Wars** (Edge of the Empire, etc.): I actually consider the system itself to be pretty simple, but the dice are kind of crazy. All the complexity lies in interpreting the funky dice, which allows the game to play like a rules-lite game. 

**Burning Wheel**: I can't even say much (I just can't even). I bought the book, tried to understand it, and I can't do it. It's complex, but not in any way that any other game is. I don't even know. From what I've heard, it's actually really good though.

**Savage Worlds**: This is deceptively complex. It tries to pretend like it's a simple game, but it has so many different options and bits and pieces and moving parts that it's hard to take it all in at first. Great system though, and it can really play any style of "high action" pulpy sort of game. I'll always have it just for *Deadlands*.

**BRP**, **CoC**, **RQ**, etc: I've played a few of these games, and they are are pretty complex, but they make so much sense that it doesn't take much to learn them. CoC is probably the most popular of them all.

edit2: 
**Super Special Bonus Round!**
I forgot to mention **Mutants   Masterminds**. Hundreds and hundreds of options that allow you to custom design any imaginable character. On top of that, the combat rules are at least as complex as any d20 game. 

also **Shadowrun**. Very complex, and it works well for the setting.  




 Usually after the first few times they mess up, and suffer the consequences, they get the idea. If not, they just aren't going to get it, and you may as well plan accordingly. 




 In the theme of recommending you buy stuff that comes with minis instead of buying minis by themselves, I highly recommend the new [Iron Kingdoms Unleashed Adventure Kit](http://privateerpress.com/iron-kingdoms/core-products/iron-kingdoms-unleashed-adventure-kit). You can get it for about $35, and it has 14 minis, which makes them about $2.50 each.

Also, 

Unfortunately I don't have any friends to play wargames with...

hit me right in the feels, whydontcha? I highly recommend going to your local gaming store (sometimes they are disguised as comic book stores). If you ask, they probably have a night during the week where they do tabletop games (even if it's just Pathfinder or D D5e). Once you find your local wargamers, you can let them know you want to start playing, and they'll try to push their product on you. 




 I'll recommend Stars Without Number for you. It's simple, can use a grid well, and has a lot of amazing features that you won't find elsewhere. 

Also, a possible good stepping stone into tabletop games would be some wargames. Something like [Deadzone](http://www.manticgames.com/games/deadzone.html) would be a great way to get used to playing tabletops, and you could go from there to something like Stars Without Number. Plus then you get to use all those great minis and terrain for your rpg!  




 [Some potential inspiration](https://miniarmyhugetimesink.wordpress.com/2015/02/09/holy-rusted-metal/) for you. 




 Not only that, but we have probably the [single best starter box ever made now.](http://privateerpress.com/iron-kingdoms/core-products/iron-kingdoms-unleashed-adventure-kit) 




 I use them, but I put foam in them. They aren't bad, but it's a really decent cheap option. 




 I was like, "Why would anyone want to go through all that hassle just to say the characters are eating and sleeping?", but then I saw the "GURPS" tag, and I needed no further explanation. 




 Have you seen the Cypher system of Numenera/The Strange? That's almost exactly what you just described. 




 I get to imagine a world. A special place I've created in my mind. Unlike writing about it, where you can let people *see* your world, you actually let people *be* in your world. They can interact with it, respond to it, and change it. It becomes something more because of their contribution. Together, you become a story-telling team. Their lives in your world will live on in all your memories. 

It becomes real. The judgments you make will define the laws of your world. The more consistent you are, the more it will become a real place in the players mind, and not just decoration draped over a dice game. 

You are also the conduit of fun for the group. Through you, fighting and arguing turns into adventure. You can turn sadness and bitterness into growth. Selfishness and spite become mystery. You can make the weak feel strong, and the ordinary feel extraordinary. You can make people fear or hope, laugh or cry. 

Basically, everyone should try it so they can feel [like a boss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NisCkxU544c). 




 Also, before anyone else beats me to it, I want to play [Devil's advocate](http://imgur.com/gallery/9Huvs) a minute. 

It's the GM's job to keep the game world consistent. Part of that job is making judgement calls on what the player's can and can't do (or what their odds are). They aren't perfect, and they are trying to weigh their decision based on the written rules (written by some other imperfect schmuck), the desires of each player (each one probably different from the other), his understanding of physics (not even real physics, but fake physics), his personal preferences, and his (probably constantly changing) vision of an imaginary world. It's a lot of responsibility, and he probably deserves some slack. Not all the calls he makes are going to be the right ones. If he's not making them the way you'd like them enough for you to have fun, then just don't play in his game, and try to find someone who does. Always feel free to discuss your opinion with your GM, though (though sometimes you should wait till after the game).

Basically, this post is advice for the player, the first post is advice for the GM.  




 I've had one or two try, but in a game where how well you do is based on how cool/fun what you are trying to do is, there's not really any need (or benefit) from trying to "game the system". Honestly I can't think of anyone who successfully "got one over on me" or anything like that, and I've played with some crafty (read: pain-in-the-ass) players.

edit: I will say though, it does take a bit of trust between me and my players. I don't have them keep track of things like inventory or ammunition, which lets them have what they need when they need it... until they don't. Basically when I think it'd be cool/fun to have their shit *not* work, I get the same ability to say "You are out of bullets" or "They've traced your call, and you're not sure how". I don't use things like, "You, a highly trained spy, was a total idiot and butt dialed them using your real phone" though, everything I say and decision I make has a reason. If it's likely you used a burner phone, and they tracked you down anyway, there is [something fucky going on](http://imgur.com/r/gifs/IgU4Y), like they have a mole in your group, or they have a super-hacker with ties to the NSA, or they slipped a tracker or bug on your while you were there.  




 I force my players to do this, and I do it all the time, with no limits and no checks. I get tired of great ideas thrown out because someone didn't think of it on the spot. Especially with people newer to gaming, but even with old pros. That's how you get games where people decide what to do based on what's on their sheet (I attack the guy with my sword), instead of doing what roleplaying is all about (I throw my sword at the rope holding the chandelier before jumping onto and riding it into the three guys on the floor below). 

To the asshole GMs who are like, "Should have thought of that before" "That's lazy roleplaying" "Blah, blah, blah", guess what? You aren't perfect. *It is 10000% impossible for you to convey every detail of your fictional world to them all time.* They don't have the advantage that their characters have of actually being there. I'm going to blindfold you, put earplugs in your ears, plug your nose, and shoot you full of drugs before throwing you in an unfamiliar foreign country. We'll see how well you do. They can't see, they can't hear, they can't smell, taste, touch, or anything of your world. All they can do is ask you what's there, and imagine it based on your shit description. And yeah, your description is shit. If it wasn't, you'd be so busy making millions off your best selling novels you wouldn't have time for gaming anymore. 

*All of that*, and I haven't even mentioned the fact that people are not their characters yet (don't worry, I'm about to). I am not a spy. I am not a warrior. I am not a wizard. I am not a hacker. I am not a rogue. Unless I am playing a damn fine looking tabletop gamer, or a charming anthropologist, I am not my fucking khakis (I mean characters). *Excuuuuuuuuse me* if I don't think of something a *real* spy would think of *before* I'm even in a situation they might be in (while having only the very limited knowledge of what's going on of being completely blind/deaf/numb with only your pretty vague description to help me out). 

Come on, son. 




 Wrong community, mate. 




 I don't know. I've been here a while, and it's honestly like we all have what we need. There are just a handful of unclear/confusing rules, and once those are cleared up people can just play. 

Weekly posts would be pretty cool, I think. Statting out Warmachine/Hordes stuff probably is less productive than the other idea though.

*edited to make my sentence make sense. 




 You *say* "Pathfinder", but I'm just going to pretend you are saying IKRPG.

Nice painting. 




 Ha ha, this from the guy who's arguing semantics about a board game.  




 Ageist. 

Lol, j/k. You kids have fun. 




 Homebrew is just another word for home-made.

What you meant to say, was how you don't get why they are saying "game", when they mean "setting", since they could very easily have used the term "home-made" instead of "homebrew" and it wouldn't have changed anything.

To that, [you are kinda right](http://i.imgur.com/40Idny0.png). Except that "homebrew game" can mean a game that **is** homebrew, *or* it could mean a game that **contains** homebrew, or even just a game loosely associated with homebrew.

There is no need to "qualify" as a homebrew game, because there isn't an RPG Association that we pay dues to that will cite us for improperly labeling our games (if you *do* run such an organization, then I'm wrong, and you should have mentioned it in your post). Don't use being a grognard as an excuse to be an elitist prick. It makes the rest of the old guard look bad.
 




 Let's not forget [First Mate Hawk](http://battlecollege.wikispaces.com/mkiihawk) who gives them (essentially) fearless and weapon master, and then their banker? [Lord Rockbottom](http://battlecollege.wikispaces.com/mkiirockbottom), gives them a bunch of great stuff.  




 Not only do I not use music, I usually get annoyed whenever someone else does. It rarely adds much to the ambiance, and usually ends up making it hard to hear what people are saying. The only time I thought it worked okay was when someone put on the sound of a crackling fire when we were in a tavern.
