 Isaiah 45:7: I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these things

Exodus 32:14 And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people

Judges 9:23 Then God sent an evil spirit

Jeremiah 45:5 behold, I will bring evil upon all flesh, saith the LORD:

Jeremiah 49:37 I will bring evil upon them, even my fierce anger, saith the LORD; and I will send the sword after them, till I have consumed them:

Micah 1:12 . evil came down from the LORD

Micah 2:3 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, against this family do I devise an evil

Exodus 22:29-30 You shall not delay to offer from the fullness of your harvest and from the outflow of your presses. The first-born of your sons you shall give to me. You shall do likewise with your oxen and with your sheep: seven days it shall be with its dam; on the eighth day you shall give it to me.

Ezekiel 20:25-26 Moreover I gave them statutes that were not good and ordinances by which they could not have life; and I defiled them through their very gifts in making them offer by fire all their first-born, that I might horrify them; I did it that they might know that I am the LORD.

 




 What a softie.... 




 Well, one country is moving in the right direction.

 Maybe the sign is just being sarcastic? 




 Why didn't he thank Jehovah for allowing this to occur in the first place?

If this shit happened to me, and I believed in god, my faith would quickly diminish.

 I am pretty sure that science, an the technology that came with it has changed more people's lives than religion...

 




 Yeah, shows the ignorance of these people... 




 Stop trying to shelter the kids... This school is bullshit, it was all about how religion was used...

Funny, how in sixth grade we know about sex, drugs, and we sure as hell studied hitler 7 years ago.... 




 What bullshit is this? Miley shouldn't even be considered for it.... Great influence on little girls...  




 That made my day

 No, the real name isn't a requirement, or an issue. You have no clue what you are talking about. The issue is it deletes your avatar, subscriptions, and allows spammers to spam mercilessly. 




 Videos that were live streamed dont have the new commenting system, yet. 




 I am not the only one with this issue. I have heard complaints from many people on YouTube. 




 1. Links are now enabled to be posted on comments. Yes, you have been able to post links by changing symbols etc. however, those links were harder to use, and less people used them. Now, comments are a Stewart to spreading RATS.
2. Comments no longer have a character limit. Although you can now better voice your opinions, and bring out your argument in one comment instead of four, there is a lot more spam that comes with this system.
3. Top comments aren't relevant. The only way that top comments are deemed relevant to the video, is through google. Here is a good example: http://i.imgur.com/3YS2RmA.png
4. Google+ deleted subscriptions and profile picture(s). When you add an account, feel free to resub to all of your subscriptions,because "upgrading" deleted all those.
5. Google+ is an extra hassle to the simple commenting system we had In the past. Google has failed to address the flaws in the previous system, an ha created more weak points I. The recent update. 




 It doesn't work because it is worse than the old system. You have bots posting links now, and these links are-- I'm assuming viruses. The comments no longer have a character limit, which just brings a.whole new level to the spam.

All the replies aren't hooked together. Honestly, reddit has the best system for comments, communication wise. 




 Why would I be happy that someone is attempting to force me to do something I don't want to? 




 The new comment system is flawed and worse than before. Why the fuck is it a good idea to allow bots to spam virus links, why is it a good idea to allow unlimited character comments? The idiots that came up with this should be hurt. 




 What fucking clowns idea was it to allow links to be posted in comments? What moron decided unlimited character comments were ever a fucking good idea? 

The new update isn't helping communicate, because its a shirt way of displaying the comments, and it fails.

I don't even have to complain about google-. That's a whole nother pile of shit. 




 They are a nice way to communicate.  




 Why are you rain washed into thinking communism is horrible?

Welcome to the server. I am train_subject9554, I help every player whenever I can, trying to make their minecraft expirience the best. On our server we feature maximum anti-grief, Builders, and police. We are trying to overcome the dying servers of minecraft. A lot of minecraft servers out there, are well.... Shit, hosted on peoples computers, not on a professional companies computer, with maximum connection. We offer 24 Hour server service, and you can play anytime. We hope you come and join us =)

Rules:

1.) No griefing

2.) No spamming

3.) Respect others

4.) No hacks of any kind

5.) No cheats of any kind



Mechanics:

Living:

When you join, you are given a large amount of choices, and you must live like you do in real life. When you first login, you will be able to greet others etc. First you must get a place to live, there are apartments and hotels in the spawn town, or you can go into the wild and make your own house.







Drugs:

The secret word is lol. Admins are the FBI agents, they, and Police (mods) will work together to make drug busts. The current drugs are mushrooms, and sugarcanes. After you are caught with drugs, you will be sent to a probation officer every week. The probation officers are advanced Police officers, which manage all the players that have been caught with drugs.






:
Companies/Jobs

This is going to be long, as there is a lot to explain. When you join, you have the opportunity to look for an employer. More advanced employers have a prefix made for the company, and have the company prefix color. To have this, the employers must have donated $5 or more. The employers are your managers etc. They will pay you to do their companies job. Each company is a supplier, unless you are a store. If you are a store company, for ex. Walmart, you can make stores, and pay the supplying companies, money for their stock. When you pay the company, the employer pays his employees, this is what runs our server. You can chose from the following to make your company:

1.) Store

2.) Farming co.

3.) Mining co.

4.) Fishing co.

and any other resource gathering/selling companies. You can make blacksmiths etc, what ever jobs you find in real life you can make.








Towns:

Towns must have a theme, a town without a theme will not exist. Each theme has to be someone similar to the towns it is near. There should never be a medival town, near a futuristic town. Default towny stuff...

 Driverless cars are more dangerous that cars with drivers. These cars will not be able to react like humans can to certain events, and there will be traffic jams, and fatal accidents.

I highly doubt government officials will use self driving cars, just due to the risk, and it is much easier to shut someone up with a "computer malfunction" and get away with it. 

We are not yet ready for this technology, and it shouldn't be available to the public. 









 Execution baby! No need to waste more at payer money when te average middle class student cannot pay for college.  




 Would have also been avoided if they hit the iceberg head on... 




 God made every person, and he made us all flawed. No one has the authority to judge people who are straight/gay. I don't see why a lot of you care, it doesn't affect you whatsoever. 




 Our education system is a joke. No one cares about classes, they are all boring lectures of stupid where some prick refered to as a teacher, tells you to do shit.... We learn to complete tests, little of that knowledge is used in our careers.

Now I bet since we are so behind, they might give us more work which will lead to less giving a shit, and lower grades. 




 Unfortunately, unless we go about uhh, round 500x the speed of light, that shit ain't close. 




 That isn't racist at all... Imagine the outrage if it was not about being white, but being black... 




 Key word: claims

They aren't unemployed if they gave up looking for a job... 




 Lower taxes---prices drop---cost of living decreases 




 Why indestructible bases? Why? 




 Another indestructible base server *sigh* 




 Are bases destructible? How long has it been since a wipe? 




 I'm guessing sauerland is a map?

 Yeah... It's otherwise known as hallucinations,

 I am not here to start a war. I do not like to look at things from one side, so i am just going to ask you some questions, hopefully you won't take offense.

Let's start like this, I was raised as a Christian. We went to church every Sunday, I mindlessly prayed, went to Sunday school. I began to despise going to church. It was just boring, all that was discussed was the same concepts of love, respect.

I began to question the bible, gods, and their existence. I began to see a lot of contradictions, and when I asked my parents, they either changed the subject, or told me I should talk to the padtor.

I did just that, yet I still kept getting strange answers, that contradicted what was said by others in the past.

Out of curiosity, I read the bible, word by word. That too was full of contradictions, and passages that could be interpreted both ways.


Why have you started believing?

Have you read the bible word for word and seeked an unbiased meaning?

What are your personal opinions about athiests?

Do you think that it is right for God to send athiests to hell for eternity, because they didn't let him save them from him?

What are your opinions on heaven/hell? 




 I am confused. Why would age have anything to do with this? 
More importantly, why didn't she use the parachute? 




 How about someone full the government of idiots. 




 The government doesn't make up the whole country. Anyone who thinks snowden is a traitor is either a politician or a complete idiot 




 No federal jobs are good... They do not boost our economy, and nothing productive comes from them. 









 Welcome to the subreddit. Thanks for taking a peek. Post anything that you find funny yourself, and share a good laugh with us. 









 Found this beautiful gem: http://youtu.be/yowsa7d_MLY

This is quite old, but still entertaining. Hope to show some people who haven't seen this yet. 




 Black rhinos are already extinct... 




 1. I believe what can be proved to me. There is evidence to prove existence for everything around us, but there hasn't been any evidence of a god. I can believe that there is a god, it is possible, but there is no evidene that suggests there is a god.
2. I believe there was a man who is refered to as Jesus.
3. The only problem I have with religion is that it is being used as a way to gain wealth, and religion has an impact on critical thinking. 




 Yup, praise The Lord for wrecking the car.... Fuckin morons. 




 Don't tell them? 




 Sorry to hear that. It is sad when stuff like this happens. That is why I hate the brainwashing done by religious persons. 




 Free speach? Profanity isn't protected by freedom of speach either. This shouldn't be a big deal at all. Go hand out your fliers somewhere else. 




 Maybe their god will get them out. Honestly, I don't want them around those orphans. 




 Why not a more recent picture? http://riehlworldview.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/trayvon-martin.jpg

That's something I want Jesus replaced by 




 Unless we visit these places, we won't know for sure. There may be life there today, but we cannot see it, because we are seeing the light from times long ago.  




 Duh, obviously, all the animals were shrunk down... Silly atheist.  
























 I too play on cobalt. Why was the clip of, cause now that I play it it seems to be an ad :/

If you post what server you play on, I might be able to make a new char and fly with you sometime. 




 No one wants to play on empty servers 




 They have a flag now? 




 Flash op 




 I despise the new system of continent locking, and fail to understand what the goal of this system is. I assumed the continent locking system would prevent unbalanced populations on continents, or bring players from indar onto Esamir and Amerish, however, I was truly disappointed.

The only continent I enjoy playing on is Esamir. The landscape isn't the greatest, however, that is the only continent that I can get good frames on, because PS2 is so poorly optimized, it makes Arma 2 look good. Now, after switching between 3 different characters, on 3 different servers, it just so happens that Esamir is locked on all of them.

What is the point of the continent locking system? Well, on the bright side, SOE statistics on performance will now show that the game is performing even better, because everyone who plays on Esamir because their PC cannot handle med-large battles on the other continents, due to the poor optimization, memory leaks, and so forth, will quit playing. 




 His head is huge, and empty... 




 How many times did the gun go off?

Edit: the school show and tell 




 That'll fix the fps for sure... 




 She gets life in prison for this, but a woman who tore her sons testicles only gets 2 years? Fuck society... 









 "We do not stop on a highway for animals, it's not worth it."

Sort of a douche thing to say. I may sound like an asshole, but there are a lot less ducks alive than humans, and their death will impact the ecosystem more than two humans dying. 

She was stupid to leave her car there, but the accident wasn't entirely her fault. 




 Looks like their offices are sausage fests... 




 If it takes so much skill, learn to aim to the point where It takes you 2-3 shot before you hit an ESF, and stop bitching.

Simply l2aim. 




 After they reach the peak of sales. 




 Flak is more dangerous than annoying my friend, if the gunner is smart. Now imagine flak and g2a lockons are everywhere.... Oh, and only 3 lockons kill you.... Food for thought?

All I see here is "br100's vetted stuff after playing for hundreds of hours, but i don't want to work for it" 




 Do you fly an ESF? 




 You hear about that street shooting the other day, kid shot himself in the foot in the middle of the street... 




 Air isn't the problem. The fact that your whole faction in the battle is waiting for someone else to play AA is the issue. If there are aircraft dominating a fight, repair an aa turret, pull a burster max, pull a sky guard, he'll even a lockon launcher will make them go away. 




 Unfortunately, some of them are ridiculously stupid. 




 Clearly SOE wants everything to be specialized, so why not allow us to refit our air Vic's?

It could cost like 25 aero resources for each weapon you change and what not. 

This would make it better for switching between a2a and a2g load outs. 




 I should have made it more clear that they went overboard on their nerfs on libs. I agree they need nerfs, but just amplifying their sound, and making them slower/less mauverable, and see how that would change things.

The reason people use rocket pods is: versatility. This is also the one thing game the game lacks.  




 Why does SOE constantly over-nerf? First, they needed rocket pods, so they didn't hurt infantry, now they are merging them against vehicles? 

First they said that rocket pods were meant to kill tanks, now yet are meant only AI?

So tell me SOE, what fked up stats are you basing these nerfs on? You clearly aren't takin into consideration that sky guard will destroy all air now, since libs and ESF won't stand a chance against them? When you use your statistics to make nerfs, do you take into account the amount of dodging that ESF's must do while fighting vehicles? Because the vehicles don't have to dodge, most of them can shoot back, and outdps the ESF's already.

Why don't you make small incremental nerfs, so you don't overdo it, and make the vehicle useless? 

 




 "As a BR 1 blah blah blah..." You didn't think this argument through. Irately, a BR 1 will have an uncerted air vehicle, making it hardly effective. Secondly, it requires skills that new players don't have.

You can easily take down enemy air with 20 mins of practice with any AA weapon, whereas it takes 30-50 hours of flying to be decent.

 




 Rocket pods don't need a nerf... It is hard enough to survive coming within 500m of an enemy sunderer with enemies that think "oh, look, air! Let's grab AA!"

Have you thought this through? I feel like this will do more damage to the air game, and the lib issues aren't being fixed: they can  turn around practically as fast as am ESF. It is ridiculously hard to fight a solo lib, considerig it is a bomber, it should need an ESF escort to survive enemy ESF attacks.

 




 Lol, I had the option to spawn at NC's WG 




 This has been pissing me off lately. I don't know whether this is a bug, or a stupid mechanic of the game. For some reason, the game decides to give me shitty spawns I don't care about, but areas being capped, with 0% our pop, don't give us spawns?

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=267590053
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=267589686

Quite frankly, doesn't help fights. 




 How much do you fly an ESF. If you have less that 30 hrs in the air, your opinions about thermal are invalid. 




 Can I borrow your enemies? Mine shoot back.... 




 Essentially coyotes? 




 Buffing AA 




 Libs are the problem. The current AA is really effective against ESF's, and buffing it would make ESF's unplayable. 




 Nerfs... Lots of em  




 Libs are the issue, not esf's. Esf and galaxies fit their role, while libs don't. With a decent pilot, libs are good for a2a and a2g, that isn't why they are around. Don't nerf ESF, libs need a nerf.

Edit: autocorrect fixes 




 Mattherson laggs quite a bit at times, this is even with a lower pop.  




 Wisest thing ever said. Some people don't understand that air can only dominate if it isn't attacked. 3 HA's with locking can kill an esf instantly. 

I play AA, and am a decent pilot, and you won't believe how many times we big out when we get locked on. Some pilots use flares though,not my thing. 

 




 When will AA get a nerf? Burster maxs and sky guard can destroy an esf in 2-3 seconds. When will soe make air game better? I feel like I am flying paper in the sky.

The amount of time and effort we put in to be decent pilots, is all countered by weapons, that require 1/100th of the skill to use.
Mattiace did a good job of explaining why there should be a balance for skill, not just weapons. http://youtu.be/F7AxfS3FHTQ

What are your opinions on AA as pilots, and what are your opinions on AA when playing the role of AA?
