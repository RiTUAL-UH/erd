 Brand new watch, I think it's beautiful but the crown is hard to screw down; seems tricky to align. Is this unusual? If I do not wear it everyday how do I keep it wound? Thanks 
































































 Living in Olympia WA geology is in your face and after reading McPhee I've got the bug. I am working through *Earth* 10th ed by Tarbuck *et al*, several books by David Alt *et al*.

Is there a geology equivalent to *Sky and Telescope*? The stuff I see is more oriented to rock hounds. Blogs or forums for amateurs? When I get some time I'd like to ramble around the scablands; any recommended spots? Thx! 






































































































































 I think they're standing in front of the storyboard. 




 Cronenberg does cruelty so well. Have you seen *The Naked Lunch*? Peter Weller is excellent and Roy Scheider is . . . surprising.  




 If measles were lice it would be harder to catch. 









 I was there, finally falling asleep after tripping all night when the walls started shaking. We had to evacuate, and went camping at the beach at Leo Carrillo. Had a great time!

 I hope you didn't have any trouble with the local Sheriff or the National Guard this time. 




 Kelley must know he is about to die in this photo. 




 I hope they get the armor right. 





























 My apologies for not marking this NSFW, and thanks to whoever did. 




 They're going to binge watch 24. 














 Wow that's great. Much thanks. I found it perusing Magnum Photos. 




 Outside of Australia he's the most famous bushranger, and there've been a few films made about him.

 Stan Laurel was also a superb mime. He'd worked Music Halls with Chaplin (he was his understudy) in London before they both emigrated. 



















 Jackman's Australian. Perhaps they're related. 
























 And Beck appears to be a bit less in your face about it. Still diminishes my appreciation of Beck, though.

 Nice juvenile *Haliaeetus leucocephalus* 




 Dad had mucho respect for the British; tough but didn't show off. As my Mom was French and didn't like Brits this made for some lively dinner table discussions.

 I wonder how much beach front property in Malibu would have been then. 




 Overwhelming.  









 What a great find! Much thanks. 




 From Wikipedia:

By 5 August the brigades of the Australian 2nd Division were exhausted and were to be relieved by the Australian 4th Division. While the relief was underway on the night of 56 August the Australians were subjected to an extreme bombardment, because the salient they occupied could be shelled by the Germans from all directions, including from Thiepval which lay to the rear. On the morning of 6 August a German counter-attack tried to approach the O.G. Lines but was met by machine gun fire and forced to dig in. The bombardment continued through the day, by the end of which most of the 2nd Division had been relieved. From its twelve days in the line, the division had suffered 6,848 casualties. At 4:00 a.m. on 7 August, shortly before dawn, the Germans launched their final counter-attack. On a front of 400 yards (370 m) they overran the thinly occupied O.G. Lines, catching most of the Australians in shelters in the old German dugouts and advanced towards Pozires. For the Australians, the crisis had arrived. At this moment, Lieutenant Albert Jacka, who had won the Victoria Cross at Gallipoli, emerged from a dugout where he and seven men of his platoon had been isolated, and charged the German line from the rear. His example inspired other Australians scattered across the plateau to join the action and a fierce, hand-to-hand fight developed. Jacka was badly wounded but as support arrived from the flanks, the Australians gained the advantage and most of the surviving Germans were captured. No more attempts to retake Pozires were made.

 Dad would never talk about the war. All he would ever say was "I did my duty". My Uncle told me about D-day. After my Dad died I found an Air Medal (with three Oak Leaves), but I have never been able to find out what he did. He never flew after the war, but worked for Lockheed for the rest of working life. Again, he was close-mouthed about work, but he was usually at a Lockheed facility in Palmdale.

There were boxes of photos from the war in the attic. Quite a few pics of paratroops loading up, long lines of C-47s.

He met my Mom in Orleans in 1944. Buts her's is another story. 




 It nauseates me to look at this.  









 Si. 




 Eddie *always* brings the sauce. Great tune. 




 Right on, Bill. Never thought of you being a speed freak.

 There are no antibiotics that can treat this infection. One can be an asymptomatic carrier as well. [Here](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/hunting-the-nightmare-bacteria/) is a link to a *Frontline* (PBS, 10/2013) which covers completely resistant organisms including a similar bacteria at NIH which nearly closed the hospital 




 The plaque affixed to the instrument panel reads:

In accomplishing her 100 missions Corsair 122 logged more than 400 hours flying time; her total hops, including tests and reconnaissance flights, reached an amazing 178. Built for air combat, Corsair 122 proved her versatility by accepting 1000 pound bombs slung from her belly and without strain or protest developed into the hottest dive bomber with wings. Were their blood in her fuel line instead of 100 octane she would be wearing the purple heart for the patch on the leading edge of her wing attesting of the accuracy of Jap antiaircraft fire. She has covered all the Jap bases in the Marshall Islands like the morning dew.

 Pyroclastic flows descend the south-eastern flank of Mayon Volcano, Philippines. Maximum height of the eruption column was 15 km above sea level, and volcanic ash fell within about 50 km toward the west. There were no casualties from the 1984 eruption because more than 73,000 people evacuated the danger zones as recommended by scientists of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology.

 Seen here during a DAST ARW-1 captive flight on 14 September 1979. Check out the Meatball! 



















 If Boorman's wife hadn't done the horrible costume design *Zardoz* would be better regarded, no? I thought it was weird but quite entertaining. "What has Arthur been doing out there all these years?" 




 Time to send the strongly worded letter! 














 Oops, thx 




 Another great contribution, thanks 




 CV-41 is now in San Diego and is a must see for those visiting. Hanger deck and flight deck one wanders around on one's own checking out the aircraft  c, but one can get a guided tour of the island with retired USN officers.

 Love the brilliantine 




 With the Big Tit in the background. Great pic 




 [Not all](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Rayburn) 




 Not for long, alas 




 While not a horror film *No Country for Old Men* is very bloody and *uber*tense 




 John Cazale died too damned young.  




 He does have a red X on his helmet, but that's not Lorenzo IMHO 




 There are a few Bettany Hughes documentaries on You Tube (my favorites are about the Minoans and the Spartans) and one about Alexandria streaming on Netflix.  




 If you have not seen *Captains Courageous* (1937) there is dory fishing off the Grand Banks and a great schooner race.  




 Axl Rose, Axis of Evil 




 Yeah, big surprise. 




 No, never in over 20y. 









 *A Matter of Life and Death*: love conquers death. 




 Quite hard to find, though. 




 The ultimate in paranoia.  




 *Dune*. I so wanted to like it. 




 "Over the years I have seen *Ikiru* every five years or so, and each time it has moved me, and made me think"

Roger Ebert, 1996 




 I always shed a tear at the conclusion of *City Lights*. Despite sound being available, and silent films being generally unpopular in 1931, it was a great commercial and critical success.  




 *9 1/2 Weeks*. Mickey Rourke (as John Gray) teaches Kim Basinger *real good* 




 *Dr No*. Great evil villain lair, and I *reflected* on Ursula Andress. Many times.

 




 *The Naked Lunch*, David Cronenberg, 1991-a little before 20y but very, very weird. 




 *Repulsion*, Roman Polanski, 1965.  




 *Hell's Angels*, Howard Hughes, 1930. Even today the air combat scenes are among the most believable (alas 3 pilots and a mechanic were killed during the production). The explosions are real, unlike the flash and noise spectacles since. And Jean Harlow uses the line "wait here while I slip into something more comfortable" (she's wearing very little to begin with) for the first time. Because it's pre Hayes the dialog gets a bit spicey.  




 The was also a big fight about a dam in Arizona. Eliot Porter has a beautiful book, *The Place No One Knew*, about the lands inundated by the Glen Canyon Dam. 




 Here in the States we call that a houseboat. Very nice.

My Grandad was born in Yarrawonga-are you near there?

 We've all seen this coming; such a long, great show he's given us but I'm still choked up. I just love what this man has done with the horn. 









 I theoretically can't wait. 




 Photos aren't much help, a squeamish person might be leery of getting close. Probable [Clothes moth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tineola_bisselliella). [Here](http://www.ipm.ucdavis.edu/PMG/PESTNOTES/pn7435.html) are management guidelines. Get an up-close, front-lit photo if able! 




 "Super-awesome" is overstating it a bit. Perhaps "moderately amusing, for a couple minutes." 




 That bear is obviously on drugs.  




 While Malcolm X's daughter is a nobody, her father's name provides the legitimacy for other more prominent black Americans to voice like-minded opinions. 




 Apparently he began his hiatus a while back.  




 Manhattan was once a major manufacturing site.

 After a couple weeks you forget the difference.

 Jeanne Calment, the longest lived human at 122y, had a glass of wine every day. Alcohol in excess is unhealthy, no doubt, but is not known to increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes, and small amouts may be healthful. 




 Cocaine causes heart attacks and strokes. Why would you want that? 




 And a border county Sheriff in Nebraska was on NPR last week bitching about how hard they have to work to protect the children from this dangerous drug flooding their county. Time warp. 




 Excellent. I'm ready for the movie. Who should portray Freeman?  




 Ignores the nasty *Leptoglossus* 









 Where's a good place to get some batteries?

 Reddit is just the best. Thanks. 




 Well step carefully, then. 




 Which "eternal flame" is this? I can read a bit on the border, it honors American dead. 




 Is it common to use the definite article when referring to this nation?
