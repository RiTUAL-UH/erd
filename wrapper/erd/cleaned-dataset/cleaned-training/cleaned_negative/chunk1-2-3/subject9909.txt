I have observed this up close, and on a macro-environmental scale.

Our driveway has ten of these trees lining it, in northern MD (my father refuses to cut them down, so we killed saplings). The seedlings are thick, robust, and fill in unmowed and untilled ground. The young tree is thorny and sturdy. Maximum size will never be out of hand, as Callery Pears rarely grow past 30ft and the trunk will rarely pass 1.25ft diameter. Each year generates a great deal of seeds, enough to plant an acre at full maturity. I rarely see them eaten, though, so I think spread is mostly accidental and by treefall.

As with many large invasive species, these trees were prized for beautification qualities and introduced commercially.

The unmowed right-of-ways of Maryland are chock full of Callery Pears. Growing up in MD, I have noticed the spread of wild invasive growth from Montgomery County, through Howard and Baltimore Counties, and into Frederick and Carroll Counties. I have seen a right-of-way filled up to a 12ft wall of thorns in less than four years.

Easy to girdle, pull up, and kill in general. Even easy to find, because they flower brilliant white and before any other tree on the East Coast (I think)! The problem/focus with extermination lies with gaining the cooperation of nurseries, developers, and homeowners to remove existing trees and remove them from stock. I don't believe in bans, all that is needed is awareness and the appropriate creation of externality precedent. That means if you plant a new tree or refuse to cut an existing one down, you can be brought to court for restitution per seedling on another person's property (including the state right-of-ways).

The state of MD is not doing anything, that I know of. I have considered calling the DNR to ask what's up, but have not. I just found this sub from /r/permaculture and wanted to post. Any more info would be helpful, especially as to efforts and the status of other affected areas.

edit: Good news! kinda. Bad news first. We cut down a big white pine last year at the end of a row. This year a thousand pears are sprouting in it's shadow. Good news second. My dad conceded we probably should have cut those mature pears lining our driveway down - and we will. 






















































 http://www.wrcbtv.com/story/25356747/drug-debate-will-punishing-women-who-take-drugs-while-pregnant-help-hurt-or-both

Will the women doing this be feeling the pain from paying any medical bills for premature births or disorders? Making penalties explicit for harming the unborn will increase demand for abortions before it ushers responsibility for actions into the minds of men and women engaging in intercourse.

Is it a worse thing to place poor mothers in jail and string newborns and maybe siblings into state care? Possibly. And I don't want to give the state the power to do so, because it will undoubtedly be unjustly dealt to some poor family.

If affected women cannot free themselves from a drug addiction, why can we expect them to disengage from one of the more basic and powerful temptations? This law does not improve anything. Might doesn't make right in treating moral laxity.

 I say put your money where your mouth is, personally.

Sometimes putting your mouth somewhere is good enough, but usually not.

Just like charity, if you want something done you are better off doing it yourself (or as close to that as possible).

Recently, the Obama administration formed ties in Syria with groups classified as terrorists just across some imaginary lines in the sand. The homework was done, and the report was on the desk, but they made a decision well removed from what any of us would see as rational. We agree a state should not meddle abroad.

I think if an an-cap decided to do something it could be summed up like this:

* Individuals would know of the intentions of foreigners like we would know of any other person's through reputation and trusted sources.

* Individuals would support them like we would support anyone else. Personal financial support. Personal physical support. Organized financial support. Organized physical support. (this includes red-cross type groups, non-violent protest groups, violent protest groups, and militias/privateers/private armies)

If there isn't a state to prevent militias (etc.) from forming. Then there is no state to prevent militias (etc.) or individuals from going abroad.

So there are two questions.

1. How would you support a cause such as the Ukrainian riots, if at all, and how would you know whom to help?

2. Does that help ever introduce externalities upon your neighbors and region? (esp. in the case of organized physical support - militias, etc.) 









 I had a thought while reading this:

Is it fair to say that it is impossible for a human to be competent at any secretary-level position (or higher) in a modern world government?

American presidents and various prime ministers have been eking through terms by lying through their teeth and their direct underlings [get burnt out from trying to do their jobs, fired for failing to do their jobs, or keep their jobs by lying and shirking responsibility - then evading the consequences of that.](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2013/11/locked-in-the-cabinet-99374.html#.UwNsoPldWrg)

**Can we start making the argument that no person can effectively hold any position in a government this large, with so many powers?** There are not enough secretaries to receive all the information and too many secretaries for the executive to be briefed by them all. Are all modern world powers effectively structured anarchy (with a side of secretary-level oligarchy)?

 [This is super-speed video of the battle.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2zWWg7-Y6o)

When I ask"would this space battle ever happen," I mean to ask that in any case. EVE Online has a few special considerations which are unique and give reason to a few things. I only played a 14-day trial so not everything here may be perfect.

* No permadeath. Everyone is playing a person that is basically immortal and lives through clones. Every time your clone dies, the memories are all saved in your original so they pop out a new one and off you go.

* Sectors have security levels. Super-mega governments/civilizations enforce different levels of security in the different sectors. Some sectors are outside any NPC security. There is fighting in between these that players participate in, but there are also fights between player alliances - which this is. 

This battle, B-R5RB, was for player alliance control of a station located somewhere else. Two player alliances agreed to fight out control in this 0 security sector so no civilization would interfere - thus limiting or entirely removing NPC combatants and any consequences fighting in a secure sector have.

* All armaments are automatic. You pick a target for your ship or individual turrets/lasers/drones/missile racks and pilot the ship so the arms have the target in range of fire.

* Warp navigation. You navigate by engines inside sectors and between sectors by warp. Traveling between sectors is kind of like taking a train. No stops in between and not all sectors connect to every other sector. Some ships (notably the biggest ones) can group warp ships around them to arrive at the same time, in the same place.

Certainly all of these are imaginable, and all are futuristic - but are they realistic? Is the result, seen in the video, realistic?

 Is this concept found already in any works?

I thought it up last night and am not well read, yet. Plenty of videos and thought under my lid, but I can't read at work.

In any case, this certainly explains how people see this thing called "government" which belongs to "everybody." With no owner (a government could only be "owned" by a sort of autocrat - not the worst thing if he's wise, but all men are fallible and nobody is fit to "rule" especially not in a permanent sense), each person who understands the the common nature of government will attempt to get the most profit out of it, ASAP. The profit comes at the expense of other's liberty - obviously abhorrent to us. But any effort to use and not dismantle this power structure, each user of the government indicates his rejection or ignorance of personal liberty. The former should be ashamed and the second admonished. 




 [Found this story](http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/science/2013/12/the-vast-majority-of-raw-data-from-old-scientific-studies-may-now-be-missing/#.UrPOyrx5sRg.reddit) on /r/PhilosophyofScience

Not a pure science question, but certainly up for discussion.

 When a group of researchers tried to email the authors of 516 biological studies published between 1991 and 2011 and ask for the raw data, they were dismayed to find that more 90 percent of the oldest data (from papers written more than 20 years ago) were inaccessible. In total, even including papers published as recently as 2011, they were only able to track down the data for 23 percent.

 Whats the solution? Some journals... have adopted policies that require authors to submit raw data along with their papers, allowing the journal itself to archive the data in perpetuity. Although journals, like people, are susceptible to changing email addresses and technological obsolescence, these problems can be much more easily managed at the institutional scale.

So where is your raw data? 









 Corn pudding is a good dish; easy to make. With a whole stick of butter it tastes pretty darn good. Bachelors! This takes a single dish to cook and refrigerates well in portions.

EDIT: [Pictures](http://imgur.com/a/9HOpp)

*Time:* Leave butter out til soft. Prep takes ten minutes. Cooking takes an hour. Serve immediately.

*Recipe:*

* **1** [can whole corn (drain the liquid before using)](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Great-Value-Golden-Sweet-Whole-Kernel-Corn-15.25-Oz/10315427)

* **1** [can creamed corn](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Great-Value-Cream-Style-Sweet-Corn-14.75-oz/10448549)

* [**1** box corn muffin mix](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Jiffy-Corn-Muffin-Mix-8.5-Oz/10448133)

* **4** eggs

* **1/2** cup butter (1 standard American stick, I believe)

* **1/2** cup sour cream

Leave the butter out to soften on the counter, covered or in the wax wrap. This should be done long enough in advance to make sure it is pliable. Maybe a few hours. (If you don't do this, you won't be able to mix the butter in fully. Absolutely not a problem, the butter will melt and get in there just fine - but getting it to mix is the proper way.) Some people zap the butter in a microwave at the last second. If that is you plan, might I recommend placing the butter in the casserole dish? 

* Combine the ingredients in a 2 quart casserole dish (oven-safe dish). We us a round dish as high as it is wide. If your dish is glass, you can watch the butter bubble towards the end. I add the wet ingredients first and make sure they are well mixed, then the corn muffin mix, and then the butter.

* Bake at 350 degrees (ovens in US are in Fahrenheit) for 55-60 minutes, or until a knife inserted comes out clean.

* Serve hot, immediately is fine.

We have this every year at thanksgiving. I had to make it this year because everyone else was too busy with our 8 other vegetables and two turkeys. And candied yams. That means it was in the oven for 45 minutes too low, and then 30 minutes too high because other dishes were more important. Last year the sour cream stayed in small clumps and was not enough to make me not eat this. My grandmother was too busy and did not mix thoroughly. I call it invincible because it is very hard to mess up, especially to an inedible state.

*Original accompanying newspaper clipping from my New Jersey Grandmother's house:*

 Corn Pudding

 (ingredients)

 Combine all ingredients in a 2-quart casserole dish. Bake at 350 degrees (F) for 55-60 minutes or until a knife comes out clean.

 Ruth T Nadolny of Hamilton says her family came upon this Corn Pudding recipe from an unexpected source.

   "Years ago my daughter Linda Burch took ka bus trip to Tangier Island in Chesapeake Bay with her grandmother. When dining, they were served corn pudding, which they thought was delicious. My daughter ventured to ask for the recipe and, surprisingly, they gave it to her. It has been a family favorite for many years now."

I can say the same for my family, we enjoy this immensely next to our Thanksgiving celery salad, brussel sprouts, and succotash. Funnily enough the recipe came full circle when I got it from my grandmother, because I live in Maryland. 




 Bill Nye's [open letter to Obama](http://youtu.be/XkWetbQHWlk) to divert more of NASA's budget to the Planetary Science Division needs this reply:

Showing that government is an able player in solving new, previously unseen, problems extends the delusion that government can centrally plan any part of human life more effectively than an individual or voluntary association.

I think NASA has done some wonderful work and solved some amazing problems with ingenious solutions, but private industry has begun to invest in space exploration. Private industry has invested in space sciences since the first communications satellites.

 Excerpts from official statement:

This year's program will focus on privateers during the "Golden Age of Sail." Leave your eye patches and parrots at home, there will be no pirates or buried treasure here! However, visitors of all ages will be able to participate in authentic drills and exercises. You will learn about the weapons and tactics required for capturing or defending a sailing ship at sea.

 Guest instructors will include Mark P. Donnelly and Keystone Academy of Dueling and Swordsmanship. They will be assisted by Park Ranger Victor Markland and members of the Mid-Atlantic Society for Historical Swordsmanship.

[Here is the quoted Plan Your Event page for the park website.](http://www.nps.gov/hamp/planyourvisit/event-details.htm?eventID=498941-232573)

[This is the facebook page to RSVP on. An RSVP is not required.](https://www.facebook.com/events/526334984068570/)

I attended this event last year, the theme was more towards the gentlemanly sports. There were a few young attendees; plenty of adults. The Hampton historic site is quiet, beautiful, and well kept. Bring plenty of water, and a hat or sunscreen. If you want to visit at times other than the event, tours of the mansion and farm site's buildings are offered on FRIDAY, SATURDAY and SUNDAY ONLY from 10 am to 4 pm. Buildings are closed to the public Monday through Thursday. Grounds are open daily from 8:30 am to 5 pm.

 I may have shut down my computer at the wrong time...

Dell Precision T1650

Computer out of box, added all the work software (adobe, bentley, Acad, deltek...), performed automatic updates twice, and restarted for extra freshness. Then, because I have to re-install autocad with a single license for the intended user, I uninstalled AutoCAD. It said Windows Explorer needed to be stopped to complete - don't worry, we'll restart it! (Yes, No, Reboot)

I said yes. Windows Explorer stopped, and the uninstall completed.

...

...

Where is my desktop?

I don't know what to do at this point, and figure a restart will fix it. I press the physical button, but never changed the option for "what does the power button do" So I think it tried to sleep. I mash the power button down for a hard reboot.
Give it a few... power on... Nothing. The box turns "on" and "off" swiftly, and no fans run. Monitor blank - tried using all display ports.

Keyboard lights up.

It does not run the recovery CD on insertion.

Mr. JONES submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary

CONCURRENT RESOLUTION

Expressing the sense of Congress that the use of offensive military force by a President without prior and clear authorization of an Act of Congress constitutes an impeachable high crime and misdemeanor under article II, section 4 of the Constitution.

Whereas the cornerstone of the Republic is honoring Congresss exclusive power to declare war under article I, section 8, clause 11 of the Constitution: Now, therefore, be it

Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that, except in response to an actual or imminent attack against the territory of the United States, the use of offensive military force by a President without prior and clear authorization of an Act of Congress violates Congresss exclusive power to declare war under article I, section 8, clause 11 of the Constitution and therefore constitutes an impeachable high crime and misdemeanor under article II, section 4 of the Constitution.

 I am working on a business plan for a service which requires a digital product. My field is drafting/modelling - not coding. This service will help designers and companies share, render, and advertise their built environments in a realistic city setting. So far, I have narrowed possibilities for creating the city to Unity3D with C#.

The digital product I require needs basic realistic graphics, an update-able city-sized map, and multi-platform availability (for read-only interaction)

The city buildings might be procedurally rendered, I think its called, where the buildings are all distributed by an algorithm, and seed numbers can be saved to keep the layout the same.

I need to know if creating this product is feasible with Unity3D. Tell me what other info you need to give me an answer. **Even if you cannot give me the answer yourself, expanding the criteria I need to gather is important.** Suggesting other communities to ask in is also a big help.

This article has been posted in other subreddits. This issue may only apply to US residents.

As far as I can tell:
American hospitals subscribe to GPOs to keep prices low. There are less than ten companies making 80% of US supply on vintage production lines. The US bars import of foreign supplies for use in health care (?). The FDA found real problems with the US products and told producers to shut down lines to fix the problems. A shortage ensued because no producer knows the capabilities of any other and no hospital knows how much every other hospital has. Nobody knows when more will be available. Nobody wants to tell anybody else about the problem for fear of public reprisal.

We can talk politics elsewhere, but I thought these questions should be addressed before a problem arises. These are questions that may appear if both Soylent and the shortage get press coverage at the same time, and may be sensational or blunt. I encourage you to share any other ideas and questions!

* Are the short chemicals and providers the same as the ones used for the Soylent formula?

* Can Americans acquire and use foreign products?

* Does buying supply kill babies? (sensational *and* blunt)

* Does increasing demand out of health care help incentivize producers to increase production more rapidly and modernize production?

 I am looking to ta talk to a developer with unity3d experience. Want to meet to talk about possible digital product.  Know anyone?  




 I am not gamedev of any sort, but have an product idea and need to know if it will work - this will help me work on the business proposal for the service which would use the product. Thanks for helping.

This product is a medium sized city filled with default buildings, rendered in realism, in which users can submit buildings to be replaced with personally made models. It should be accessible on a web browser without installing an application to the computer and be accessible through a mobile application. In the best case, a link in a webpage or email can send you to a specific address in the city. The focus is on the models, not interaction. In this way, it would resemble a changeable Epic Citadel demo on a city-wide scale.

Do you expect this will be possible with UE4?
Will the map be too large, and loading times too great? This isn't procedurally generated.

It looks like my only other option for would be Webgl... and it is a bit primordial. But please enlighten me to my other options; none I remember is powerful enough for the level of graphics I need.

**tl;dr** What if I made an epic city (think looks like epic citadel), where you could put your buildings in, then everyone could go look at them on mobile and in-browser. Could I do it on UE4? 









 My experience is in CAD drafting and architectural design. I have an idea for an online service which revolves around a digital product. My business plan needs fleshing out.

The digital product is a realistically rendered city. I must be able to update the map and link to locations via hyperlink in browser. It should be accessible from as many devices as possible, with mobile being a choice possibility.
What I need to know is if any game engines out there would work, or if it needs a fresh engine? Unreal engine 4 is cross platform and powerful, but I need to be able to direct people to distinct locations from a link outside the application.

Is this where to start ? Also I'm near Baltimore if you want a chat.
Advice is appreciated. So are criticisms and corrections ;] I haven't told you what the service based on the product will be on purpose.

 With a New propensity for governments to use biometrics to collect our data and verify our identity, I think at least here in the United States of America a constitutional amendment is needed to control this resource. Immediate and reliable identification processes can be used to catalog and corral people like cattle,especially during the implementation of martial law.
I propose that a two-thirds supermajority of both houses of congress would be necessary to expand the use of biometrics in federal jurisdiction.
This popped into my head this morning and I thought I should post it. 





























 Out of the night that covers me,

Black as the pit from pole to pole,

I thank whatever gods may be

For my unconquerable soul.

In the fell clutch of circumstance

I have not winced nor cried aloud.

Under the bludgeonings of chance

My head is bloody, but unbowed.

-

Beyond this place of wrath and tears

Looms but the Horror of the shade,

And yet the menace of the years

Finds and shall find me unafraid.

It matters not how strait the gate,

How charged with punishments the scroll,

I am the master of my fate,

I am the captain of my soul.

 [The interview is wonderful](http://www.grindtv.com/outdoor/excursions/post/husband-wife-row-pacific-ocean-high-fat-diet/). I found it on Facebook through a [Fat Head](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcNPfZlrZs) fan group.

 **You are now the fastest pair and mixed pair to ever row across the Pacific, the first couple to row from California to Hawaii, the first Finnish person to row across any ocean, and Trulia is in an ongoing acquisition by Zillow for $3.5 billion in stock. You must feel on top of the world. So whats next for you?**

 I try not to cling on to any accomplishments or results, whether they are good or bad. I like moving forward, staying active, and building new things. After catching up on sleep a bit, my life will hopefully include more of all those things. But probably no more rowing for a while!

What do you think?

The page isn't clear whether they mean support or legal eligibility, but its just a facebook meme so I don't expect much. Legal eligibility is ludicrous in my opinion. Restricting the field of candidates like that is asking for trouble.

More and more, I'm thinking a president just needs to have the priorities, principles, and political support. The first two make him a candidate, the third gets him in. Service in the armed forces supports the third part. Military service definitely puts people in a hotbed social environment where many will decide who they are and what they believe - galvanizing them to stick to what they discover for life. This, the ingrained posture, vocal respect, and personal grooming habits are what draw civilian voters to military candidates.

Obviously, none of these are specially reserved to candidates from our armed services.

What seems to set them apart is first-hand knowledge of the place where so much of our tax money goes, where people say our freedoms have been won, and where many of our American heroes come from. The mainstream calls every soldier a hero - but this isn't the case. [You know it isn't.](http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/12/the-tragedy-of-the-american-military/383516/) Military culture is filled with rascals and fools, pompous jerks and outright destructive personalities. Civilians have a problem relating to what they see, and do not spend enough time reading about or talking with service members to understand the full picture. Assuming the people who rise tot the top and then put in a lot for president know the financial and internal political situation is unreasonable, but you never see them tested publicly.

Many have not served, but why can't they prove to voters that being inside the armed services isn't the same as *knowing* the armed services? 





























 [Matterport](http://matterport.com/) is a new product and related service which enables the rapid scanning of a building's interior, [viewable online in browser.](https://matterport.com/try/)

This [blog post](http://www.valueoc.com/2015/01/05/2015-year-matterport/) sings some pretty high praises, so I thought I'd ask here.

The website for OC Matterport, mentioned in the blog, works ok in IE. Doesn't work in Chrome, so I found [their Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/ocmatterport/timeline).

I have been following Matterport for a while. They use Microsoft Kinect sensors and custom software. Packages for scanning from the company start at $299. The device costs $4,500 and Matterport controls their own hosting services with year plans valued at increments of $500 (three tiers).

That means the company has to scan at least 130 homes of minimal size per year with one full time employee. I wonder how fast the price of OC Matterport increases.

**EDIT: There is integration with Zillow, [Check out this listing](http://www.zillow.com/homedetails/31356-Isle-Vis-Laguna-Niguel-CA-92677/25575500_zpid/). In the "Facts" section is a link to the matterport tour of the house.** 














 Anyone seen the irony of statists protesting, saying that their rights are being oppressed and they need more protection... even though by many definitions they think their rights come from the government? So how are their rights being crossed if they are not legislated, yet? How can they conceive of asking for a right before it is voted on?

[This started bugging me after I watched this clip of Monty Python's Life of Brian.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFBOQzSk14c) Their intent may be to joke at the whole situation or just one perspective, I don't know for sure.

Of course I'm not talking about illegal stuff happening which are obvious offenses against people's objective rights as humans. 




 If a company is to form to manage and adjudicate contracts, it must verify the language, assets, and persons in each case. The person traditionally given this responsibility is the lawyer - or a notary. Notaries usually have all the powers of a lawyer except the ability to try a case before a court of law. 

Do you think a law company will employ notaries directly [as the French government does](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notaire), or should they be hired directly by private citizens to review contracts [as Americans do.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notary)

Seeing as a company would have to review the contract before agreeing to it anyway, I see companies putting out standard contracts forms like Legalzoom but keeping notaries on hand for custom work. This then enables them to let customers use either self-reporting or freelance notaries for basic and rote contracts. 














 I do not have children, yet, but my coworker and I had a discussion about his teenage son who is grasping internet security more slowly than hoped. The father's approach has been largely hands-off, but he realizes this isn't working. The child has a small gaming addiction, has lost money on scam trades, and has riddled his laptop with viruses to the point when it was brought into a specialist he commented it was the worst he'd ever seen.

Most of us grew up alongside the early internet. We can tell a sketchy website from a respectable one. We know the premise of scams enough to weed out most offensive encounters. Most importantly, we know to ask questions of communities and be generally cautious. Some of us even know to RTFM.

A brief search yielded to me only product pages and advice against revealing personal information. Nothing about not clicking the flashing "10,000th VISITOR" buttons (and their devious descendants) or giving out gaming account info.

Are there any subs or resources on Reddit for this? Are there any very good books on the topic? 









 A lot of black scribbles, red eyes, and fearsomeness. 









  ...we need a way to ensure that scientists publicly announce which studies they are going to run, what methods they will use, and how they will analyze the data, before running their studies.

I just read this article on [preregistration](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/2012/04/14/fixing-science-systems-and-politics/#.VHYQQTHF-rg) and wanted to ask Redditors what they thought about it and what is already happening in the field. That article is from 2012, but the author recently linked it in an article stating he still supports it. Reform in the science community is needed.

 With that much land, having a plan is necessary.

Do you have a plan? I noticed all the garden plots in the video, but most seemed to have been turned into lawn.

 I am just west of Baltimore, Md and am leaving my apartment in the middle of the lease. The lease dictates I pay rent for two months after I leave or until the apartment is occupied, whichever comes first and the rent will be pro-rated until occupied. I have one full months rent as security, but would like to make sure I escape the second. I can harp on my specific apartment, but the office can't push it due to fair housing laws.

I was in a junior apt. You get a wall between living/dining and the bedroom, but not an actual door.

One issue is that the area is close to areas of ill repute, but we don't have these problems in the apartment complex.

What websites should I use, make sure I submit reviews to, and whats the best way to get this in front of college kids? I just had the idea I should ask what colleges my building-mates attend.

Thanks in advance.

 Lets talk healthcare.

Who knows anything about using a primary care service in Maryland? Are you in a network?

 Catastrophic insurance only plans? How to make contributions to independent HSAs tax exempt?

What websites do you use? Maybe there is a news service (or even a single story) you find helpful.

I've got to start somewhere, we need to vote with our dollars. But the websites I have found are all focused on sucking you into their plan (I can't blame them for following Always Be Closing) so they aren't much help unless I give them all my information. 









  ["As a Republican, Johnson was twice elected governor of New Mexico. As a Libertarian, success is defined as getting 1 percent of the vote... There are also plenty of Republicans in competitive races who deserve to have a Libertarian candidate running against them. Rand Paul isnt one of them."](http://rare.us/story/gary-johnsons-foolish-rand-stand/)

The point of this article is that running a strong Libertarian Party candidate would spoil Rand Paul on the issues. It would undermine his support just enough for Rand to lose. Rand is certainly going to be the most sensible person on the stage if no LP candidate runs. If we want better now instead of best never, then the LP should just butt out this year - or at least high profile candidates should not run.

If libertarians want best now rather than better, then I'd love to hear your plan and where you are going to get a billion dollar war chest from. Also how will you get your candidate to shake the hand of every eligible voter in the US - that is what it would take for them to even consider an LP candidate *right now*. No LP candidate will have the media coverage, name recognition, or party machinery to make a dent in the (I am being quite honest) wasteland of American intelligence on politics. You need those multipliers as a matter of fact.

The point is not for Rand to win using the %1.76 of the vote he might get, that is obviously not the case. **The point is to support him. Give him the volunteers. Give him the money. That is how he can win in 2016.**

All the volunteers and money going to the LP doesn't have the multipliers Rand has going for him - meaning the media coverage, the hype, and the support of the Republican Party.

_________________________________________________

I don't expect everyone supports Rand Paul in this sub. I am not taking for granted that this is a Republican sub and not a libertarian one. As a matter of discussing political strategy that should not matter. I want to hear if you want LP to run a strong candidate to spoil Rand in the primary. I want to hear if you think I am missing something. 




 You'll be scratching your chin and suddenly feel *that* hair.

We all get them, ingrowns, split hairs, infected follicles, acne, and... those thicker not-quite-normal hairs which you know are just the most wrong thing. They make us feel freaky and human. We pull them out (some come out so easily!), we cut them down, we stare at the goopy, dense, roots before flicking them off into the trash.

Does this mostly affect electric shavers? Regular groomers?

Whats the longest franken-hair you ever did see? Whats the most amount of hairs coming out of one follicle you ever pulled? 






















































 [Today Reddit found out about Silvio Gesell](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdPIOUTd2k) via [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2i9sqm/til_a_man_called_silvio_gesell_once_created_free/). [The video has been seen previously on this sub](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/1mgs6h/silvio_gesell_currency_and_the_economics_of_money/). The phenomena is generally known as [The Wrgl Experiment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%C3%B6rgl#The_W.C3.B6rgl_Experiment).

Silvio Gesell's amazing shrinking money was like fruit.

Humans can trade in whatever means they wish. Most articles are traded today to indirectly gain goods and services later. We don't trade baskets for sheep, we trade baskets for dollars and then go trade dollars for sheep.

In a world of competing currencies, some are better stores of value than others. In a world of competing tradeable articles, most currencies fluctuate in value more than goods.

But fruit is not one of these goods. Fruit is only useful once it has reached a certain maturity, has certain provisions for care and preparation, and reduces in value over time - just like Gesell's currency.

There is a time and place for every money, but I think it is very funny to think of a whole town trading in fruit and would love for someone to show me who - if anyone or everyone - got the thin end of the pear in this case. Take us to the core of the issue. Explain how this currant-cy was actually a detriment; or maybe that this is a case of the right recipe at the right lime.

 I think Microsoft has been moving to hardware for some time - or at least hardware technology licensing - but only came to develop the Surface device with the hopes that public schools would use them in coming years.

Most of us remember taking plenty of state-run tests in grade school. Gaining information on students and schools has been a top-level topic for public school advocates and large publishers for about a decade. These groups got together recently to attempt to bring their vision of a 21st century school to fruition. All the ["future classroom"](http://youtu.be/mPUfwX4Nqy8) videos made by Microsoft, Pearson, HP, or non-profits have tablets and large interactive screens. Microsoft has [their vision](http://youtu.be/aJu6GvA7jN8) in heavy research, as seen in this [lab visit](http://youtu.be/rJ1p5SD3sOM)... well... part of it.

The other part is already in your hands.

Top publishers and education non-profits came together to create the Common Core standards for the United States. The Bill   Melinda Gates Foundation is the largest among the non-profits associated with the standards. These were created and then passed to the states via grant competitions. [The standards are picking up flak,](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peter-greene/how-the-common-core-lost-_b_5694139.html) but not only for how unworkable they are in the classroom. The standards also required legalizing and creating a series of databases for each state in which every school and child is tracked. They call it infant to workforce data tracking.

Some people out there have plans to put a tablet in every schoolchild's hands for the whole day.

As we have seen with the NSA, big data is a big topic and gets a lot of funding - yet officials there say they have no good ways of finding those needles of notable info once they collect the haystack of chatter. The education industry didn't get that message before anteing in but they can just go back to creating the old style books. Microsoft is close to turning a profit and has created an competitive piece of hardware which has not turned a profit yet (that I know of) and the company has no graceful way to slide out of the hardware market right now.

And those grant competitions? Billions of dollars were handed out which baited state and county school boards into spending increasing amounts of their budgets to keep up with the change in curriculum. Reports of boards being advised to buy stacks of books, only to have them go unused, can be found in every state which decided to chase the new standards. Many local school boards have been pretty sleepy, and some have been sleep-building expensive (and usually unnecessary) new school complexes. Their budgets are tight and teachers have been denied cost of living increases in a great many places.

That said, many parents are buying their children tablets, anyway, so if the state says each child needs a school tablet then who do you think would be made to buy them when the infrastructure to make schools able to use them is shriveling coffers?

With Common Core lying on the chopping block and all the other funding problems public and private education has, we can look at the picture with some more insight and try to figure out where Nadella will take the Surface - even if gradeschool education was not a goal in the first place.

So what do I take from this? What compromises or design choices did MS make in the first models that are no longer there, now? RT is gone, for one. Such a constricted OS doesn't make much sense for an adult, but for a child...

P.S. Yes, I don't like the standards, myself. I tried to give information here, and not any more opinion than that I think the Common Core standards are going to be discarded.

 HEMA, Historical European Martial Arts, is the study and practice of the ways of war and duels from Western culture.

Free for spectators, Longpoint is a HEMA tournament taking place at Turf Valley Resort near Ellicott City, MD. The pools of competitors have been whittled at for two days already - come and see the best of the best.

Watch talented men and women compete with synthetic and steel longswords, messers (a single-handed sword), single-stick (literally a rattan stick - fun and people wear little armor), and do cuttings (technique display with sharp swords).

I'm helping staff tables, but have trained in longsword. This is an amazing activity. We get into padded armor (not like sumo suits, think fencing) and the scoring system benefits those who can make a hit without getting hit back and those who completely control the exchange. You will see fast sword work, suspenseful moments, and skilled throws. You will also see tanks whose blows are terrifying and ladies who can take on any challengers.

 Why bother with flags of convenience? The information and assurances ports want guaranteed by a nation can be guaranteed in other ways.

I searched to see if this has been talked about here, and didn't see anything. Just had a thought and busted this out to talk about is and share.

TL;DR Steps  
1. Fly the black and gold to represent a ship as not registered with a nation.  
2. Use the internet or private resources to .  
3. ???? (Make trades and produce to enrich yourself through the market)  
4. Profit!

Is there a *need* for this? Maybe not a dire current need, but there is certainly a desire to remove one's property from the liability of registering to a state. Flags of convenience may not always be available so planning them away is prudent, profitable, and interesting.

##[Excerpt: *A GUIDE TO SHIP REGISTRATION* by the Government of New Zealand](http://www.maritimenz.govt.nz/Publications-and-forms/Commercial-operations/Ship-registration/A-guide-to-Ship-Registration.pdf)

 The registration of ships is a time-honoured practice. It began principally as a means of controlling ships entitled to carry 
cargoes within the seaborne empires of Europe. In more recent times, however, **it has proved a convenient means of 
establishing title to the property in a vessel** - in other words, who owns it. At the same time, **registration has served to 
determine which country's law governs the operation of a ship and the behaviour of those onboard** - key concepts which 
today play an important part in the international law of the sea. 
 
 Basically, **registration confers nationality on a ship and brings it within the jurisdiction of the law of the flag state**. Thus, a New 
Zealand registered ship is bound by New Zealand law - both its shipping and other applicable provisions - though the vessel 
may venture well outside the territorial limits of New Zealand. **A New Zealand ship abroad is accorded the protection of the 
Government of New Zealand**, much as a New Zealand citizen is while travelling overseas. **A vessel's bona fides are established 
by its registration papers** just as a passport establishes them for a person. **Registration may also determine criminal jurisdiction 
in the event of any incident or accident in international waters.**
 
 Further, registration facilitates financial dealings in ships - their sale and purchase and the raising of mortgages - and **brings 
back to the owner responsibility for any liabilities incurred**. It does so by evidencing title to a ship and thus declaring to all the 
world who owns a particular vessel.

 Emphasis mine.

Flying a flag of Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Belize, Bolivia, Cambodia, the Cayman Islands, North Korea, Georgia, Honduras, Lebanon, Malta, Mongolia, Panama, and Saint Vincent or the Grenadines is not going to afford the ship much protection in fact, flying these [makes you a target for inspection.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_convenience#Port_state_targeting)


* We live in the age of information. Independent ships can list themselves openly on the internet through a self-hosted internet site (which companies can glean and aggregate information from) or use a beacon to broadcast the relevant information locally.

* If states [want to impose regulations on ships](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_convenience#Environmental_effects), there are solutions. Ships can be registered into standards associations and companies.

* The ancap flag does not resemble any of the [International maritime signal flags](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_maritime_signal_flags), but I have not checked all of admiralty.

Just like bitcoin and other innovations in the realm of decentralization - there needs to be options for systems and applications. 

















































  Nearly 2/3 of all recent education graduates in Ontario are unemployed or underemployed the following year. British Columbia certifies nearly 3 times the number of teachers it needs each year. Even fast growing Alberta has seen many of its school boards laying off teachers in recent years.


 The question of what is a fair salary and remuneration package for public school teachers is a difficult one. I dont have an answer for it either. I do know that the masses of unemployed recent teaching graduates implies that the total remuneration package for teachers is above the market-clearing level. Schools do not want to hire more teachers because they cannot afford them. Incidentally this is one reason why the teachers union and school administrators cannot meet eye-to-eye on the issue of class sizes. Teachers want smaller classes, but administrators cannot afford to hire the number of teachers necessary for this at the current remuneration packages.

 These fresh graduates  bright eyed and bushy tailed  want to make a difference in a childs life. They cannot find work because of a union that has negotiated wages above the market clearing level.

  Let unemployed teachers replace unionized ones during a strike at a wage rate they negotiate with school administrators. If the teachers on strike are worth the money and conditions they demand, the school administration will be all too happy to reach a settlement with them to get them back in their class. And if not? In that case wed have a pretty strong signal that the remuneration package they received in the past was too generous.

 http://www.zotloeterer.com/welcome/

http://www.kourispower.com/

The Zotloeterer Turbine system and Kourispower system appear very similar, and I want to introduce you to them and explain the differences. **This is interesting because Kouris' original and only patents are different from what he is trying to sell now.** This is a personal and unprofessional work, and I have no connection or contact with either group aside from possibly sending an email to the Zotloeterer group a decade ago.

* A [vortex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vortex) forms when fluid rotates around an axis. Both system uses an outlet positioned to enable a vortex.

* The differences in systems come from how the water is coerced into forming a vortex and how power is generated. I will use "paddle" to refer to the exposed turbine of the Zotloeterer design and "turbine" for the submerged turbine of the original Kouris design. It seems "impeller" is a misnomer for a turbine in-line with the flow of water and filling the cross-section of a pipe.

##The Point

The installation called the Marysville Pilot Power Plant in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwqwLoc93ZI) and [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPIWSVhVHL0) is *not* the Kouris patented design. It does not primarily utilize the power generation feature detailed in the patent documents. Nothing you can see but the pipes and dam resemble the patented work. It uses a paddle and generator resembling the Zotloeterer design. Kouris says there is an impeller in the outlet pipe, as well, but obfuscates the matter. He concedes the impeller is a failed idea, but **I conclude** he keeps it to maintain a semblance of patent control.

Kouris also has a [two-episode feature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxxHdOmHEes list=PLD3902BBECFFF27CF) on Youtube. If you look at the patent and press release dates from Zotloeterer and then watch this, you can see a little problem. I don't know the guy, but I'd say Kouris is a liar. He uses poor terminology and doesn't have a scientific explanation that makes sense. All his language evades resembling the Zotloeterer system. That's sad, because the technology is good and admitting he doesn't have a patent isn't the worst thing in the world (unless he has a big ego that doesn't let him). Because Kouris has an inspirational origin story for the turbine design, but not the paddle design, I think it is safe to say he discovered Zotloeterer designs and copied the core concept.

Kouris says in the video his vortex uses the power of centripetal force but evades saying "gravity" and his brochure says ["operated using the kinetic energy created by the earth's rotation"](http://www.kourispower.com/wp-content/uploads/brochure20.jpg). The Zotloeterer Turbine is marketed as using "gravitational force," which it does (both do). Water falls because of gravity, a vortex just makes it also move horizontally on the way down. Unless Kouris thinks that the earth's spin pushes water out of springs and makes rain fall (both wrong), it sounds like he thinks vortexes form because the earth spins (very wrong).

Look at [this mock up of Kouris' original, patented, design](http://youtu.be/QZSq3alBS_o?t=9m45s) versus [this Zotloeterer concept](http://www.zotloeterer.com/attachments/Image/Fliessgewaesserstrukturen-2011.jpg?1391875144099). I saw the in-line concept in 2003 in high school - about when Kouris modified his plans. In that clip, Kouris is talking about the new design *with the old, discarded one onscreen.*

In the rest of this post, we can see all the reasons why Kouris left the old design behind.

##Structures

The *patented* Kourispower system exists freestanding in the middle of any standing water - generally a dam. A pipe outlet runs from a few feet under the surface of the water, straight down, and then out the bottom of the dam. A vortex forms as water is able to approach the outlet from every surface direction. [image](http://imgur.com/8tPZs7c)

The Zotloeterer system basin is located to the side of a stream with weirs. Water enters through an off-center inlet and exits by falling out the bottom through a central hole outlet. A vortex forms above the outlet through the assistance of the off-center inlet; this enables the basin to be placed out of the immediate path of the flowing water. [image](http://www.zotloeterer.com/attachments/Image/ground-map-GWVPP-2012_1.jpg?1391874738397) / [image](http://www.zotloeterer.com/attachments/Image/bio-reactor-GWVPP-2012.jpg?1391875380890)

I realize the distinction may not be clear. Consider the placement and benefits of each system. Zotloeterer turbines are *to the side* of a *flowing water*. They are part of a living stream or river. Kourispower turbines are placed *in the middle* of *standing, dammed water*. They are scantly different from the internals of the Hoover Dam... except now there is a cool (and kinda dangerous) vortex! WOO STRAYA!

##Power Generation

Zotloeterer systems normally use a paddle on a shaft hanging below a generator as the power generation feature. Since there is only one axle, there is less to break and less to make. The generator is suspended above the basin with the paddle over the outlet, so it is spun by the vortex. Recent patent documents describe a feature which places the generator *in the paddle*. This makes it so that it is not an axle, but a pipe with a wire, that is lowered into the vortex. The paddle-generator appears small and fit for third-world applications where simplicity and being self-contained is traded for power production.

The Kourispower system patent details placing a turbine into the outlet pipe. The vortex does not drive the feature; the vortex was thought to increase the flow past the turbine compared to simply having a submerged pipe. This is similar to a traditional hydroelectric dam operation, but was intended to increase the flow enough that the system can generate relevant amount of power at smaller scales. The flow is not faster, and the turbine experiences less efficiency.

##Watts

 GWVPPs are hydro power plants for low head from 0,7 up to 2m and for a flow rate from 0,05 up to 20m/s and for a power range from 0,5 up to 160kW.

##Pros and Cons

|Kourispower|Zotloeterer|
|:-----------|:----------|
|Creates open vortex on surface of standing water|Vortex is contained in concrete basin|
|Requires fish ladders/ minces fish that go through turbine|Fish are proven to be safe to traverse basin and weirs|
|Requires dam to create still water for stable vortex in addition to head|Requires only head, usually from weirs|
|Problematic to screen from debris without interrupting vortex|Vortex can take small debris, large debris screen is before inlet|
|Susceptible to debris clogging|Flush gate can be operated to clear screen for large debris|
|Maintenance requires draining dam to below outlet|Inlet can be closed for work, moving parts above water|

##Patents

Both groups list where they are patented [K](http://www.kourispower.com/about/) / [Z](http://www.zotloeterer.com/welcome/gravitation-water-vortex-power-plants/patents/), but Zotloeterer goes a step above and has most of what you need to recreate their design posted, published, or in the patents. This is always useful for dreaming, scheming, or if they don't return your emails. I think patents are a little frivolous and prevent people from freely improving on other's work, but I don't think that is a discussion for this sub.

I had fun writing and formatting this, and I hope you enjoy it [and the formatting](http://reddittext.com/).

 Subbing.

I grew up in the [Christopher Erb house](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Erb_House) in Maryland. Let me know if you want a post about it.

200yr old stone German immigrant house. Basement is center wall, the two stories and attic above are center hallway. Our floors are so crooked. There is a sister house and my personal theory is that the Erbs started to make a split floorplan but saw [Hampton Mansion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampton_National_Historic_Site) after finishing the basement and decided to change the plan.

Not until I happened upon a book about the similarities between the [Zwaanendael Museum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zwaanendael_Museum) and the building it (in part) replicates did I know about jointery markings. The specialized language of rafter joining. I'd been sleeping under the exposed rafters for years.

The house is a form of Georgian colonial architecture.

  ...due to natural factors.

I am here to challenge that specific part of your answer. Not to say "I disagree," but to ask if you have considered the information I will share. It suggests that the perceived climate change event was actually man-made through a lack of understanding.

There are other authors who have stated this, but David R. Montgomery is the one which seems most accessible. His book [Dirt: Erosion of Civilizations](http://smile.amazon.com/Dirt-Civilizations-David-R-Montgomery-ebook/dp/B007V2D4JO) is just long enough to remark on many different instances of the phonomenon of erosion caused by agriculture dooming a population. He summarizes the book and shows some data which was left out for audience tailoring in [this lecture.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQACN-XiqHU)

The floods, famines, and desertification of much of the meditarranean and middle east can be attributed to the cutting down of trees and plowing of loose soils until gone. Ur was a port city and now lies a hundred miles inland. The mountains of the levant used to be lush but are now dusty crags.

It does not seem that cyclical events caused the agricultural failure. [Milankovich cycles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles) and [DansgaardOeschger events](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dansgaard%E2%80%93Oeschger_event) could be, but I have not seen anyone claim it.

So the peoples of the Bronze Age ruined their land. This caused floods when there was no more soil and wooded plains to soak up the rain; famines when soil died under the knife of the plow; and a lack of strategic resources when wood was burned for fuel. This followed a population increase dependant on the use of deforested land. Once that land was desertified and decreased in yeild, scarcity strained the social structure.

I'm not an expert and I probably could have just dropped the link on you and asked the question "have you read this and do you agree?" instead of writing all that but I did. 














 If you want a good look at a system, I highly recommend this video [on earthships](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efI77fzBgvg). Don't go crazy for them - that is all the advice I can give you. It is easy to get sucked into such a simple and complete idea that you forget all your good ideas and personal opinions. Don't spend time watching and reading every thing there is about earthships... especially when there is work to do! 




 I went through MIT's Open Courseware for a few classes. The following are links to pages which lis the readings and even have direct links to Amazon for the book.

You might look at the reviews and selected sections refereneced in the courses, then try to find books locally. Maybe your professors have copies you can read from and scan. 




 That is a reason to make the law, but it isn't necessarily a need when the fines can be upheld in courts no problem and people are just as likely to not fight it.

 The point of the question is that the law didn't need to be created for the fines to be collected, the understanding of previous laws just needed to be brought up to date.

 That also holds for the cost of capture and trial, right?

I think in normal session law the boundaries would be set for the various things which go into each. The salaries, facilities, and processes will all have to be fleshed out in various ways and then codified. 




 I thought initial citizenship would be a necessary addition to the constitution, as well. But right now the nation is under the temporary leadership of a separate body. Initial membership would be handled by them and standard citizenship and naturalization would be handled in normal laws. 




 I think you are referring more to fines. I am talking about the administrative cost to perform whatever punishment is deemed necessary: the wages for the clerk who files the fine and the equipment for that.

How much could it be, right? But it is there, in the constitution, so it has to be fixed. 




 If he is labelled as inherently threatening, that could be the immediate conclusion.

The extreme example brings to mind a lone hero riding to the gates of the walled city of Liberland... half dead on his horse. He comes bearing important news but is turned away or shot with an arrow...

  .28. No Citizen shall be deprived of the citizenship under any circumstances, nor shall he or she be extradited to another jurisdiction against his or her will.

I wonder why the authors chose to prohibit the act of outlawing someone. 




  .26. Convicted criminals shall not have their liberty restricted except so far as is necessary for the protection of others, nor their property seized except so far as it is necessary to make restitution to the victim and/or to pay the costs of the criminal's capture and trial.

The last line might need to include the cost of punishment.

 To that I say: Soldiers throughout time have been expected to carry from 40 to 80 pounds at any time marching, and sometimes approaching that in arms and armor during battle.

 I don't think so. 




 So are you going to take your cheap internet points and run or go look at the vibrant communities of professionals and enthusiasts who spend hundreds of dollars and thousands of hours learning about swords and their use? 




 "Modern swords" can mean a few things. You probably either mean swords of modern design (fantasy blades and such) or swords of ancient design made with modern technology (reproductions). It actually makes no difference because there is a reason swords ended up with the weights they did in the time they were used - that was the balance of power and agility desired. Even as carbon content increased with more steel (bringing on rapiers and the like), the weight stayed within a consistent range.

Most swords are about three pounds.

Does that sound "heavy" to you? That is less than half the weight of a gallon of milk. A sword cannot be too heavy because of the nature of the balance. Your hand is the fulcrum of a lever and on one end is more weight that the other. 




 Kenneth Branaugh is another one, for me. 




 "Swords are heavy" is a misconception.

 It makes sense for libertarian scientists to run, because they wouldn't have to debate or decide what to regulate, how... they'd just deregulate. 




  I felt like it never even occurred to the author that I might be consciously making a choice.

People do make choices, but those choices are affected by the political structure in which they live, including coordination with businesses at various levels.

Another given in Strongtowns articles is that the sprawl occurred during a wasteful period and that tax revenue from suburbs rarely are enough to support the infrastructure. Just as local governments spent money poorly, so too have many American families - it can be hard on families to justify living in the suburbs when they would much rather exchange the nature and freedom with ease of access to jobs on cheap mass transit and high proximity to wants and needs. The problem comes from the market having been twisted away from dense construction of a quality which enables this. People complain about schools and crime, and the construction in cities recently is either for colleges, singles, or well-off families.

So why is that? American families *want* suburbia but many cannot afford it and would do well to move in. They can't because their house won't sell; they won't because they don't think it is a choice which will make them happy, safe, or prosperous; they can't because builders see basically no demand. Meanwhile, the tax receipts on sprawled areas are putting American towns in debt.

It can come off as insulting. I'm not going to lie. Strongtowns is facing this problem where people disagree because they think the writers disapprove of their choices. We just wish you had more choices, but known the *real cost* instead of having political involvement muddy that.

I, personally, drive 20-30 minutes to work. I live on the edge of a major city and can walk to grocery, gym, park, and church. Also, school, if we had kids.

 Ah. I would count social conditioning as the opposite of something being thought about, but morals do appear in both cases of pressure and engineering.

So when I said reflection it meant an image, not a philosophical viewpoint (but it could have meant both). That was a little lazy of me. 

 We are made to be very very good to out fellow man, but only the good we think about.

 *or are forced to contend with due to social pressure*, as you point out.

 And then, only to people we define as fellow man.

And boy, that is the mother of all "nurture" scenarios.

What made Mal such a great character, and what makes everyone pine for the unexplored depth of the characters and universe, is that mix of social pressure and constructed morals. I think we felt like those people on the tiny space boat showed us more about ourselves than we wanted to know, but in a slightly-detached way which made it easy to enjoy, rather than suffer through. 




 I do not agree morality is "intrinsic" but do agree it isn't proprietary of any religion, rather it is a reflection on our humanity and the limits of our nature.

 And that bad chick from Iron Man three was his girlfriend (by name) if I recall. 




 Well it is between how stupid she is and how willing to flip-flop to get the young vote she is.

I think she really cared about that issue.

It will almost definitely come down to *what* young vote she'll try and get... probably the Tumblr one. She is all about social justice and not realyl about connecting with anyone male that isn't in a union. So she'll probably try and institute some kind of mature game registration or a new rating for inclusiveness or something. She won't ban them, just put layers of control on them.

That is, if the legislature returns to the Dems. I need to look up on that chance for 2016, but anything is possible two or four years after that. 




 It depends what your priorities are. A lot of people are pretty enthused on the Republican side. A blaze article on Hillary's announcement mentioned Lincoln Chafee and Jim Webb as possible Democrat contenders. Lincoln will need a new haircut, at the very least. Jim Webb is hoping he'll be able to quickly move past all the scandals already in his past (substantial or not). 




 Well that isn't personally tragic. 




 If by that you mean qualified at completely screwing whatever pooch she's tied to and getting away with it, then ok.
