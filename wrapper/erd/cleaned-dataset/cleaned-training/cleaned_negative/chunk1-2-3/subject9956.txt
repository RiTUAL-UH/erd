I tried demo and i love it, but i do not have enough money at the moment (and i am going to write an article on it when i get it). Sciency rockety stuff! I would be very grateful :) 




 I have a spare copy of this great game. Actually, it is my the most favorite game ever.
Post the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything and i will decide. 




 So, a few weeks earlier a guy stopped me near the place i go to school. It turned out the guy is a Hindu preacher, trying to sell some books about Krishna and talk people into religion.

I kinda like him, we talk for a moment every time i go that way, but he appears to be very brainwashed/clearly instructed. First, when i told him i am an atheist, he tried to tell me atheism is a religion (i told him it is in fact absence of faith). Today i told him i read The God Delusion and he went on how atheist don't know facts and write about it (i even told him Dawkins has all sourced), whereas religious books are true (particularly his own religion's one, obviously, because when i told him e.g. Bible and Quran are just books, that it is not an evidence of anything, he seemed to agree).

I am not sure if it's worth trying to learn him at least anything, I don't know if he listens. But I don't particularly like arguing with people, so i am not pushing anything.

 Hi everyone,

i do not expect to be many Czech people here, but i am going to post it anyway. With help from couple of other Czech bronies i managed to finish Czech Subtitles for the first part of [Brony Chronicles](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2EOfhvvURY feature=player_embedded).

It was difficult, but i am proud of it. I do not expect it to be well-received here, but even if one person find it useful i will be happy.
BTW yes, i already posted it on Czech forums.

It it for 720p version downloaded off YouTube.

 When my cat lies somewhere, she put her legs and tail under her so she looks like a little furry blobby bean. It's adorable.

I just wanted to share with you. 




 Say it with a picture! 




 It's old, useless and powerless, i just want to be sure it won't shock me or something. 




 After five troublesome years i can finally rest from it and study English. 




 Here is a download link to the torrent, thanks to the loyal seeders it is quite fast.

 Can i set all except characters/objects/buildings on minimum and maintain good fps? What has the biggest impact on performance?

**DEEP WEB**, not the surface one
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Web 




 We've seen it in many movies and experienced in many games - enemy/alien threat is overpowering some major USA city, in the end the military/goverment decides to send a nuclear missile in there. Could that be a real scenario and under what circumstances? 












































 Psychonauts is an older game, yet it is my THE MOST favourite game ever and i will tell you a few reasons why:

* It's very different than any other games in terms of its originality
* Art style is fantastic even with limited texture resolution and limited amount of polygons
* The game is very humorous and funny
* Each level offers its own unique gameplay 
* Game setting is quite joyful and the plot is intriguing
* It has many things to collect, which serves not only for a sole purpose of being collected, but it's important for game progress.

Albeit it's an older game, the time hasn't taken anything from its enjoyability. If you pass off on it, you will miss one of the most original games ever created. 



















 I tried to Google, but i am not much smarter. 



















 I was going there, because some awesome things there were mistaken for uncool. Have we won?

 We got NMM, Discord, Chrysalis and Sombra. We all are excited by possibility of seeing some of them again, but every season so far introduced at least one new villain. Who do you think it will be in Season 4?

 Starswirl the Bearded was a powerful magician, who lived more than 1000 years ago. He invented spell to transform a pony (unicorn or pegasus) into an alicorn. The regal sisters used this spell to become alicorns and thus defeat Discord (and then Sombra). They kept the book for themselves and Celestia is testing her pupils (many generations of them). If they prove themselves to be worthy enough, Celestia reward them with turning them to alicorns. 












































 There is Derpy trying to open cookie jar with her hooves without succes, cursing "What kind of sadistic retard invented this crap?!. In the next panel is Celestia opening the cookie jar with her magic and she says something like "Hohoho". (i love her expression while she's doing so, that's why i am looking for it) 










































































 Today i found quite shocking (and somehow truthful) quote from Terry Deary: 
"I've no interest in schools. They have no relevance in the 21st century. They were a Victorian idea to get kids off the street. Who decided that putting 30 kids with only their age in common in a classroom with one teacher was the best way of educating? At my school there were 52 kids in the class and all I learned was how to pass the 11-plus. Testing is the death of education. Kids should leave school at 11 and go to work. Not down the mines or up chimneys, mind, but working with computers or something relevant. Everything I learned after 11 was a waste of time. Trigonometry, Boyle's law: it's never been of any use to me. They should have been teaching me the life skills I was going to need, such as building relationships, parenting and managing money. I didn't have a clue about any of these things at 18. Schools need to change."

 I enjoy fanfics, where ponies are getting drunk (no clopfics), i read a couple of 'em, but i want more.  




 Hi, a 7305 days ago, i was born here in Prague. Today I am 20, and i am no longer a "teen". Here's a few notes:

- i i am kind and friendly
- i am timid and shy
- i would want a family one day
- i am an atheist

Anyway, happy birthday to me! :)

 After playing a real obscene number of hours in Kerbal Space Program, I got into Simple Rockets pretty well, even landed on the Smoon and Smars - it is a bit easier thanks to being 2D - but I can't seem to be able to match velocity with rendezvoused-with ships. Docking was one of my favourite activities in KSP and I was quite good at it, but afaik there is nothing like relative velocity nullifying marker in SR. I managed to dock only once, and it was not very graceful, which is displeasing.
I don't know how to use that grey thing. 




 It was on Reddit some months ago, it was a project of a group of students of Spanish language. I need it quickl, thanks. 









 a) Every so often I experience a bug where the ship starts to rotate (using reaction wheels, it consumes power) by itself and only SAS keeps it in check and I can't get rid of it (not even by reloading). I suspect it has something to do with using physical/time warp or SAS toggling while rotating. Does anyone else experience this? How to get rid of it?

b) Is it possible to jettison an engine without having it set as an action group? 




 The beginning of the conversation is lost (it began at Omegle, it was basically that he is a Messianic Jew and he believes in the creation by Yahweh). This is copy paste of our email conversation (without names, emails and greetings); I would like to know what do you think of my reasoning, if I should improve something. Thanks.

 E.g. if I was dreaming about riding a rollercoaster which was about to smash into a wall, a cat jumping on me in the real world would project itself into the dream as the impact.

I don't think that the message needs to be spelled out. In this form it is quite obvious.

Aside from the message, it is extremely well done. 




 Hello!
I am quite fond of KSP, and this caught my eye as something I would surely enjoy (building bases/ships/...). It is on sale, however, I can't spend money on it this month. I would be very thankful to whoever would be so generous as to gift me,  and I make sure to pay it forward in the future. :)

 It was an issue we came upon today in school while discussing animal mistreatment. 









 This question occured me today - do the turning radars at KSP point at some specific point or trajectory in space? Is is possible that there are some undiscovered easter eggs? 







































 Fellow froods and froodesses!
Every Earth year on May the 25th, we hold a tradition of visibly carrying towels around with us, because on this date, there is a regular increase in flying saucers fly-bys, though we can't see them easily due to SEP field, and we have to be prepared for sudden untold adventures, Earth demolitions or serendipitious petunia materalizations.

In every case, this act also serves as a homage to Douglas Noel Adams, who ~~wrote~~ received from extraterrestrial beings this utterly extraordinary trilogy in five parts, and decided to share it with us.

Whatever happens this day, don't panic. Or every other day, for that matter...

Just reading this makes me sick. They use religion as an excuse to slaughter each another. It is surreal. 




 I am interested in reading Krauss's book Universe from Nothing, and I'd like to know if the recent discovery of gravity waves affect that hypothesis in any way, and how?

If this question makes no sense, I am sorry, I am no scientist. 


































 Ever since 0.23.5, I am often experiencing a weird time warp/gravity physics bug, where all parts of my vessel except the main part (capsule or whatever) go limp (as if in a freefall without horizontal speed), it becomes fixed (meaning it doesn't move and it is not affected by neither pressing keys or burning) and the trajectory changes rapidly even when not burning. When I try to time warp again it says that the time warp cannot be used under acceleration, or it disassembles rapidly. 

It happens in orbit around Kerbin. 




 I've seen a mod that adds giant asteroids (FSAA or something like that) as parts, but no mods that make them appear like vanilla asteroids. I understand that they would be virtually unmovable, but cool bases could be built on them. Is there any engine constraint preventing this? 














 I have passed both levels in practice tests, but I have a dilemma. I was almost bored when doing B2, but I am not very sure I can pass C1 again, though I did good in the practice test. 




 I run it on an old notebook (to process one chunk of data lasts several hours) and I don't know if I actually contribute to anything. And I heard some skepticims about whether one should run it. 

























































































 It seems to make the game a lot more realistic, if harder. Or there could be an option to toggle KSP/realistic gameplay.

What is the reason for not having incorporated it in the game yet? 









 Today I decided to play Ace of Spades Classic once again, so I go to a server and join the blue team. After changing several maps, one turns up where blue team is having its ass kicked really hard, when a message suddenly appear in the chat:

 We may not be winning in the game, but we are winning in our hearts.

Thank you, random stranger, for encouraging me a little.

 Come on sucker, lick my battery! 




 Do you think it had some connection to THE box or to Rainbow Power? Surely if she was studying somethingunrelated, they could just make her sitting and reading silently? 


































 She's an indoor cat, and we don't plan her to have kittens anyway, so we're going to get her spayed. I googled about it and what are the benefits, but I still feel bad about how drastic it seems and that she won't be able to reproduce. It is just sad :( 









 I sometimes go there to see what retarded things people say there, and it never fails me laugh. But it also enrages me a little, when I what turds can people spew of their mouths, and how ignorant some of them are - religion serves them as an excuse to not seek reason, to abandon critical thinking, to embarras themselves. Cattle do not see the stars and think they are special in the universe. In comparsion with immersity of the universe, we are uncomparably less than nothing.

I hope there won't be a shortage of people who publicly present reason, science, atheism etc. to people, because I have a grave feeling that it might actually be possible for the world to become a place where non-believers would be put ot death, if there would be no vocal opposition.

Just wanted to get this off my chest, carry on, or discuss it, if you wish. 














 I am watching Frozen right now (had heard that it is a nice progressive fairy tale) and it is well known that Disney movies work for majority of people, they can make people smile and cry at every age. Why exactly is that? 









 What if all those things with right arm are just a running joke to tease us, just like with the snail? Are there some solid pieces of evidence implying that he is really going to lsoe his arm?

I just watch the series, I haven't read comics or anything other yet. 














 [In the newest infostorm](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/265-Kerbal-Space-Program-Asteroid-Redirect-Mission-The-FAQ) there was this passage.

 **What is this Claw thing?**

The Advanced Grappling Device, or claw, is your primary means of capturing an asteroid. The Claw works very much like a docking port, however, it doesnt require a mate node to dock to. That means it can grab on to almost any object. Once grabbed on, you can even transfer fuel from the grabbed objects (provided they have any). 

Does this mean that regular docking ports become less useful? This wording implies that I can just launch a fuel tank tank with a probe on it into orbit and suck from it with this claw thingy. 














 I posted some shops to /r/photoshopbattles a few times, but I actually enjoy more cutting people/things out than think what witty should I do with it. 





























 A few weeks ago I have read an article about possible human colonies floating in Venusian atmoshere, and a question occured to me whether something like that would be possible to build in atmosphere of some Kerbol system planets?

I read on the wiki that lighter probes don't even need a parachute on Jool, so I don't think it would be completely impossible. What do you Kerbal rocket scientist think?

 I do it just as a hobby, don't get any money. 
























 Life would have been much easier.

**Edit:**

Utterly meaningless coincidence: 

Bartledanian books are 100 000 words long. According to the [Words to Pages](http://www.wordstopages.com/) converter, a book with 100 000 words written in Arial font size 12 with double spacing would have 365.3 pages. That is almost exactly the same number as number of days in a year. 









 Whoever posts best inspirational quote wins and I'll send them the key. 




 Just because it is so nice and quiet here 









 I get that you can carry 1000 books in a reader everywhere, but paper books are flexible, have "personality", last potentially a very long time and frankly, do you really need to read 15 books at a time? 




 No posts. I am not longer interested in it, so anyone else can take care of it. 


































 I know there is no point to it without mods beside satisfying feel, but i would like to ask you what do you think should be there, how big it should be and so on.

EDIT: Without mods of any kind

 I think we should get a bot which would after typing something like "BibleVerse: Part XX:XX" respond with corresponind verse from standard King James Bible.

Commenters on this sub often adress some verses, so this could be useful. I wonder whether this idea have been proposed before, if it was, i am sorry.

Same could be done for other holy books too.  




 It's because of authority of the person who said them? Or because the quotee formulated the idea so well that a quoter feel they don't need to add anything?

And why some people hate quotes so much?

 



















 I was on Minmus with Bill and Bob. On the top of a lander there was a rolling probe, so i rolled it about 1,5 km away, did some measurements and flew with Jeb to collect data (well, more slid than flew).

When i was a few tens of meters from it, i switched to probe to slightly angle it for convenience. When i wanted to switch back, there was no Jeb.

He disappeared.

I was confused at first and looked for him all over, but he simply vanished. I went to Astronaut Complex and he is listed as MIA.

What the hell?

BTW when i planted the flag i named it Jebediah's Vision after that creepypasta; coincidence much? 




 [SteamID](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197997373039)

It released yesterday, but i don't have any money. It is on sale now. I would be very grateful and make sure to pay it forward later. 




 I play on lowest setting due to my old PC, but i was thinking if i could afford to make my game a bit prettier without losing performance. 









 After almost 300 hours of playtime i found out how to rotate parts in 5 steps and how to clone. I feel stupid. I was thinking how people make Death Stars and bowling balls and lithobraking stuff and it never occured to me to google it.
If i did not watch some Manley's video i wouldn't know it... I thought i figured the game by myself. Well, i have a lot to learn yet.

Edit: And of course the rest of controls too, i forget to mention it. 




 I am browsing interwebs and what i don't see like announcement that the Octodad sequel finally came out! I am extremely happy, but i remember i ran out of my allowance for this month and will have to wait and buy it when it will be not on sale anymore.

So please, if someone could give it to me, i would be very grateful and make sure to pay it forward later.

 I am pleased. I love oatmeal. I think i am going to make myself a cup. 




 The question of money would be put aside, because people would realize the utmost importance of expanding into space, so all materials and workforce would be for "free" (people could even volunteer for working on some tasks like manufacturing parts, which would then be send to ~~World Space Center~~ Starfleet from all over the world; those who participate in programme would get all they need from governments) 


































 Note: I am a fan of 2005's Doctor Who. I am not planning on watching older series, i am quite content with the new.

I must say it is one of the best series i've seen. About a year ago i started to hear from my friends how good it is, they posted DW related things on Facebook and i am naturally quite open-minded, so i put it on my imaginary "To watch" list, but i did not rush in any way, actually, it was one of my new classmates who gave me needed push.

First episodes were feeling like it was a cheap TV production - it probably was, and i do not complain - and it got better with time. I love series which have consistent universe, and DW satisfied me in this way.

Not everyone may see it same, but i like how they put homosexuality in there every so often - i am not a homosexual or in LGBT community, but i am happy for those people, i support them (of course i like gay jokes and so on, but that is different). I also felt some atheist themes in the series, that was pleasant too. I also very like the Doctor's "no guns" policy, it's not something you can see very often today.

I sure am going to continue watching, though i call myself just a fan (don't really have urge to call myself whoovian yet; maybe this will be my backup fandom)

 There is always someone who hasn't seen something yet. 




 I flew to the Mun and collected high amount of scientific data, but i underestimated needed power to get back to Kerbin, and poor Kerbal must have EVAed (of course with data) and set himself on stable orbit. So i send first rescue - it was a probe with four solar panels, i don't know how, but i managed to position the way that no light could reach them, thus rendering probe dead. For my second try i attached two 1x6 automatic panels to it and i even managed to get rendezvous orbit - but in the wrong way! Now i am going for my third try. Wish me luck!

EDIT: Finally! That was insane, it took 4 tries before i managed to pick up poor Kerbal, and then i had to position vessel hanging on a parachute so he won't fall off his seat (another valuable lesson - always using capsules). 









 If i add an addon, will it render my vanilla profile save unusable in vanilla again, even if i don't use modded parts? 




 I have googled a bit, but i can't see nothing. 














 What is the point in rescuing Kerbals?

Have you ever collided with a piece of debris from your earlier launches?

Do you consider mods cheating? 




 I landed dozen or so manned modules on Mun, i learned to dock on orbit (i started to build a space station) and i got a few new upgrades.

 I have never been particularly good at multiplayer shooter games (and I don't play them often, so I am not very skilled), usually I was in the bottom half of the scoreboard, but I always enjoyed myself.

What are your feelings about it and about low-scoring players? BTW I am not looking for comfort, so please speak your honest opinion.

- Philae bounced twice and travelled some distance, but somehow managed to land again and it is stable, but it is rather unknown if it is on its side or upside down or what

- most instruments work, ESA getting science data

- all means of firmly attaching to the surface failed (that is bad for drilling, isn't it?)

- no panorama photos were released yet

Yurop badass yet?

Edit: Lol, it was actually three landings 


































 If something goes wrong and the lander bounces off despite the engine pushing it "down", will its mission be considered entirely unsuccesful? Do they have one shiot only or can they try to push it down again after bouncing off?

 I don't give a damn. 







































 I installed WD Black 1GB yesterday, but neither Windows nor Disk Management can see it. I plugged SATA data cable into the motherboard and I am powering it through [SATA-Molex adapter](https://i4.alza.cz/ImgW.ashx?fd=f3 cd=MK297a i=1.jpg) plugged into a cable that was until now powering only 2 fans. I checked the cables and they seem to be plugged well.

Edit:I forgot to add Troubleshooting tag, sorry.

EDIT2: Issue solved, thanks for help. 





























 By means of natural selection, not invoking higher power. 


































 It is on sale now, but I really don't have any money left, and it has been made available on Linux now. I'd be grateful if someone were so kind and gifted me (of course I'd pay it forward). :-)

[My Steam ID](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197997373039)

The base game would be enough.

EDIT: I just got it from one of my friends. 














 By idle I mean when they sit somewhere and stare at things. Do they asses dangers and look on their environment for changes or what? 




 If you put a small engine on the bottom of a rocket/tank with larger diameter than  that of said engine, then when you attach something to the engine from below it creates fairings, but those have only the engine's diameter.

It can be secured with struts, for sure, but it looks ugly as hell, and having to meddle with Procedural Fairing's interstage fairings is a bother.

Is there any mod which makes it right?

The strangest thing is that she still is just a 4-month-old kitten.

 I have 64-bit Ubuntu and tried to apply this patch, but it does nothing for solving the mk1podCockpit/model problem for me. :( 




 After X hours of building I am exhausted, so I am going to make it simple:

I have to plug the GPU and 2 fans (front and rear) into the PSU.

GPU has connector, which is split in two, each of them looks like this

 I o x x x I

Both fans also have dual connectors, but they are each different:

 I x x x x I

 I o o o o I

"x"s represent pins, "o"s are holes

The PSU is modular, and I have one cable which corresponds to GPU's and fans' connectors. 


From PSU end, it goes like this:

 I o o o o I

 I o o o o I

 ----------------------------

 I o o o o I

 ----------------------------

 I o o o o I

 ----------------------------

 I o o o o I

 ----------------------------

 IooooI    (a small header connector)

How should I plug it all to the PSU? It doesn't seem doable. 














 I bought some new hardware and got a Radeon Silver Reward code. Since I am not in need of any new games at the moment, I decided to give it away here. You can get 2 games this way.

For my amusement, draw a squird (squirrel+bird) drinking Bailey's out of a shoe, the best/most humorous drawing wins the code (I'll PM it to the winner).

EDIT: It is over, /u/saad93 is the winner. 




 I am about to order all components for my first build and I was skimming through my picked parts when I noticed that PSU was 430 V and recommended voltage for GPU was 500 V.

So I searched for a bit and found a similar question here on BaPC where was said that recommended GPU voltages are for the whole system.

I also used a PSU calculator and it showed me that even less voltage is needed (400 V), so that confused me even more.

How do I make sense of it?

Link for picked parts:

http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/2efx5f/build_ready_is_this_good/

If it turns out to be OK, this post might be regarded as Build Ready I guess. 




 I have decided on my first build, but today I remembered that people recommend to install OS on a SSD. The problem is that I do not have enough money at the moment to buy both at once, so I am torn if I should get a SSD first and add HDD later, or go for some SSHD.

I have to decide quick, since I am going to buy all components tommorrow, so if you could recommend me some drive, it would be great.

Here are the parts I have picked.

 Hi, first time builder here, I would like if some of you could check this gaming build out before I buy the parts. Mighty thanks to /r/ltbh , who advised me with picking some different components (okay, he altered like most of them, I am embarrased).

 Hi, I have read the wiki and various guides, and I have already chosen my parts, but it turns out I might not have enough money for this build (and I would like to have some money left):

__________________________________________________________

My budget is maybe 20 000 K (960.20 USD), this build without SSD would cost me 23 741 K (1139.81 USD).

I can add a new screen and SSD later, but it is going to suck until then (my current screen is a tiny 1024x768 one).

I would appreciate your help with rating this build and, if possible, recommending something cheaper. I didn't make this [Build Ready], because I am not entirely sure yet.

Thanks
