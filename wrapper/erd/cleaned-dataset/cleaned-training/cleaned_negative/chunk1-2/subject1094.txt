 I hardly doubt Romanians or Bulgarians were holding off working in the UK cause of these restrictions. I believe those who wanted to leave did that already. British tabloids played a dirty role in making a fuss out of nothing. 




 Enlighten us brother. 




 The Guardian has a different take on the report than the BBC http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2013/apr/05/eastern-european-migrants-report "Romanian and Bulgarian migrants 'unlikely to head for UK'  report" 




 I work for an IT infrastructure company.

 This might help answer that question: http://spectrum.ieee.org/aerospace/astrophysics/what-curiosity-will-and-wont-teach-us-about-martian-life

Over the years, planetary scientists have had to significantly revise their expectations for what they might find. In 1976, when the first successful Mars landersViking 1 and Viking 2reached the planets surface, many had high hopes that the spacecrafts instruments would be able to settle whether lifeeven simple microbial lifeexisted on the Red Planet. Each of the Viking landers carried a suite of instruments, including a combination gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer that was designed to detect organic compounds liberated from heated samples. But none of the Viking instruments found convincing evidence for the existence of life, or even its most basic ingredients.

About 30 years later, NASAs Phoenix Mars Lander made a discovery that may explain why the Viking spacecraft came up dry. In 2008, Phoenix found abundant amounts of the potent oxidizing agent perchlorate in the Martian soil. Perchlorate can destroy organic compounds released during sample heating, and it may also be able to destroy organic material in the upper layers of Martian soil, well before it is scooped into a spacecraft sample chamber. The surmise is that, if organic compounds exist on Mars, perchlorate may have prevented them from being picked up by Vikings instruments.

Curiosity could finally settle that question. The rovers Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument includes a mass spectrometer and a gas chromatograph, just as the Viking spacecraft did. But each of these instruments now boasts much better capabilities. Working in concert, they will be able to detect trace amountsat the level of a few parts per billionof organic compounds released from the stepwise heating of samples retrieved from surface soils and cores of rocks. Although this level of sensitivity isnt too different from Vikings, Curiosity will be able to heat the samples up to greater than 1000 C, twice the peak temperature of the Viking instrument set. That will help liberate materials that might otherwise stay trapped and inert in a sample. Whats more, SAMs analysis protocol calls for adding substances that can reduce the temperatures at which organic compounds are released from samples. Perchlorate salts are thought to be released only at higher temperatures, and with this procedure, samples will be heated to only 350 C, which should reduce their tendency to decompose.

 You're right. However, most people I know, friends and family have bought houses close to work or/and in good neighborhoods. I don't think we in Holland have adopted the American way of buying a house an hour or 2 away from where we work. Also, from my understanding and I could be wrong here, there are a lot of houses for sale in undesirable neighborhoods.

So, I think we the Dutch choose to pay more and thus compete for scarce property.

EDIT: Here is some data from the Dutch Association of Real Estate Agents http://www.globalpropertyguide.com/Europe/Netherlands/Price-History


    In 2008, house prices fell by 5.3% (-7.5% in real terms)
    In 2009, house prices dropped by 1.5% (-2.4% in real terms)
    In 2010, house prices rose slightly by 1% (-0.7% in real terms)
    In 2011, house prices dropped by 3.8% (-6.2% in real terms)

As you can see, the drop per year is not really dramatic percentage wise. 




 Just an FYI: The title of this article was changed after I submitted the story. I took a screenshot from Google search showing the old title http://imgur.com/1l9h34R. 




 Houses are scarce in The Netherlands and the pressure on prices has mostly been upward which is what keeps the house prices from tumbling rapidly. The cost of buying a house eats up a large proportion of income for an average Dutch citizen which is part of living in the Netherlands.

 Software patents are a problem. The only beneficiaries of software patents have been lawyers and big corporations. You could be a smart innovative developer, but if you don't have lots of money to pay licensing fees or start a patent war, you might as well forget it. I hope other countries will follow this.

 Most probably we are. A sad day for humanity when a trailer with an air conditioning unit is worth the life of a 17 year old kido. 




 This is a newspaper with a history of bigotry and racism. It is never a waste of time to keep reminding people that UK's second most read daily newspaper is a despicable racist rag.

FYI - In the 1930s the Mail ran numerous articles praising Nazi Germany, the Hitler Youth, Mussolini's Italy and the British Union of Fascists. It's often refereed to as the "Daily Heil": http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail#Inter-war_period 




 Just in case it wasn't confusing enough already, the BBC is reporting the opposite on their Twitter breaking news handle "Syria again refuses UN inspectors access to site of possible chemical weapons attack near Damascus, US says" https://twitter.com/BBCBreaking/status/371612304921853952

EDIT: It seems CNN got it right. The BBC is reporting the same now: Syria to allow UN weapons inspectors to visit site of alleged chemical weapons attack near Damascus - state TV https://twitter.com/BBCBreaking/status/371615966436012032

 Every time they plug a hole another opens. I don't know if the solution for Greece is getting out of the EU but I do know the Greeks are paying a very heavy price for all this borrowing that has taken them no where.

 Egypt can't survive this insanity much longer at the rate they're going. Violence and hate have become a normality in Egypt. At the end of the day these prisoners were also Egyptians - just like the guards who killed them.

 Thanks for explaining. The article also mentions the women kicking the officer in the face and biting him several times. 

we saw the woman kick a police officer in the face [the officer also said the woman bit him several times, and tried to grab his portable radio to stop him from calling backup 




 I don't speak French but from the story:

I was shocked to hear the policeman saying This is bullshit  its always the same ones. They then put handcuffs on the first woman and left her lying in the street for several minutes. When another police car arrived to take those arrested away, he yelled at her again: Shut your trap, you bitch.

I guess its about racism and unorthodox police language/behavior?

 A few more months and your (and ours) dream will come true: European roaming charges will end in 2014 http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-06/15/roaming-charges-die 




 My understanding is that exports were the main force behind these good numbers.

EDIT: Here is a short post from AFP http://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/portugal-beats-recession-export-led-233733208.html

The recovery was driven mainly by exports, and shrinkage of the economy on a 12-month comparison was halved the data showed. 




 Sorry about that. Thank you for removing, pylori. 




  PS: Czech Republic   Hungary are parts of Central Europe.

You're absolutely correct. It's a very common, but now outdated definition of Eastern Europe i.e "Eastern Bloc" or "Communist Bloc" 




 I find it quite unfortunate. I was (and still am) hoping diplomacy would prevail. It's embarrassing in this time and age to see two EU nations threatening each other with legal and economic threats.

 I lived in Marbella for over a year. I would go once a month to Gibraltar to buy cigarettes since they were much cheaper than in Spain. 

I remember the always crowded border crossing with Spaniards going over to shop and the hundred of tourists visiting. It would be a terrible blow to Gibraltar's economy.

I have a hard time believing this will even be considered by the EU let alone implementing it.

 I believe the article is about much more than that. From the article:

Agents are not allowed to authorize violent crimes under any circumstances; the most serious crimes must first be approved by federal prosecutors. Still, the department's Inspector General concluded in 2005 that the FBI routinely failed to follow many of those rules. 




 That was supposedly Putin who is Russia's president. Medvedev is Russia's prime minister.

Title: Revelations about the French Big Brother

Article (it's behind a paywall for those who desire to read the full story):

If the revelations about the U.S. spying program Prism led a chorus of indignation in Europe, France, she did minor quibbles. For two good reasons: Paris already knew. And does the same thing.

The World is able to prove that the Directorate General for External Security (DGSE, special services) systematically collect electromagnetic signals from computers or phones in France, as well as flows between French and abroad: all our communications are spied. All e-mails, text messages, telephone records, access to Facebook, Twitter, are then stored for years.

If this huge database was used by the DGSE who officiates as outside French borders, the case is already illegal. But six other intelligence services, including the Central Directorate of Internal Intelligence (DCRI), customs or Tracfin service fight against money laundering, including the data that draw interest daily. Discreetly on the sidelines of the legality and beyond serious control. Political know perfectly, but the secret is the rule.

This French Big Brother, brother of U.S. services is illegal. However, its existence appears di ...

 Valid point. He answers that in the article:

Sang has no illusions that even a clever cryptographic fontwhich you can use in email messages to shield them from snoops and font-recognition botswill remain encoded for long. They're not meant to be long-term tools with which to combat the NSA. Rather, he views them as an awareness-raising measure.

"This project will not fully solve the problems we are facing now," he writes, " but hopefully will raise some peculiar questions."

 Looking forward to it! Hoping for a good result tonight too. 




 Disgraceful. It's a shame a good player like him has very little moral.
