 The Runaways? 









 New X-Men, Astonishing X-Men and Ultimate X-Men are all great, self-contained stories that are easy to jump into. Ultimate X-Men isn't canon though. 




 So, the same thing they did with Cars 2 and Monsters University - didn't want to risk a new property, so they've reskinned it to fit an old one. 




 For example, I think Doctor Strangelove would be very interesting if remade in a post-9/11, Iraq War USA. 




 I hope he is carried over to the 616. 




 Pretentious is the wrong word. It's more like they have a set of prejudices. Proof: in their list of greatest films, number one was Borat and number four was Team America. 




  "Out of the five student movies I watched, four incorporated violent shoot-outs over a soundtrack of iconoclastic 70s pop hits, two climaxed with all the main characters shooting each other at once, and one had two hitmen discussing the idiosyncrasies of The Brady Bunch before offing their victim." 




 JRJR has a style, some people like it, some don't. I personally don't, but because itms so stylised, I don't think it's bad, just not my cup of tea. Like cubism or sculpting. 




 As a comic fan, it upsets me they must fall to the clich of fighting the first time they meet. Batman and Superman have one of the sweetest relationships in comics and I'd hate to see that bastardised so we can see Batman kick ass (again). I don't think I've ever read a fight where Supes wins. 




 Cage to Detroit, uh? Any paticular reason for that? 




 Ellen Page as Kitty Pryde. I think it's just because I had a crush on the character since I was a kid and seeing he in live-action just did it for me. 






















































 Captain Marvel sure kicks ass, huh? 


































 ... But I say it was more of a 50:50 split.

* Stane was great - more-so as Stane than Iron Monger - even if he lacked proper motivation. Bridges makes him. 1/1
* Ross and Abomination weren't great. They both acted incredibly irrationally. 1/2
* Whiplash was underdeveloped, but Hammer was genuinely entertaining. 1.5/3
* Loki was a deep villain and as close to a Shakespearean character you're going to get in the MCU. 2.5/4
* Red Skull was pretty awesome, but I can't think of any defining character traits sans "is Nazi." 3/5
* Loki redux. 4/6
* I love Iron Man Three, but I still don't really understand what Killian wanted or why. 4/7
* Malekith was never expanded upon (which is a shame as I felt there was some good stuff there. 4/8
* Pierce, The Winter Soldier, Crossbones and Batroc were all used brilliantly and kept in line with the tone of the movie. Of course the villain was Hydra, rather than a single character, but that made the move stronger. 5/9
* Ronan was underdeveloped and - like Ecclestone as Malekith or Rourke as Whiplash - was a waste of a fine actor. 5/10

5/10 = 1/2 - I say it is 50:50

So there you have my highly subjective opinions on the villains in the Marvel movies. Of course y'all disagree, but I think this is highly representative of the common opinions this sub. I personally don't think any of these villains reach the level of the Joker or Doc Ock, but half of them have been fairly decent.

One thing I've noticed is, the problem has become so much worse with Phase 2.

So, thoughts? 









 Like when a character is transplanted into another genre - like the Hulk in Planet Hulk (Science-Fantasy/Swords-and-Sandals), Nova in Annihilation (Science-Fiction), Daredevil in The Man Without Fear (Crime). Would Fraction's Hawkeye or Azzarello's Wonder Woman count as examples?

Edit: Please list the character and genre you think it fits in. 



















 Hypothetical: The big publishers have come together to discuss the state of the industry. They've decided they want comics to be more mainstream and more people to read them. They've hired you to do it. How do you? 














 I haven't read X-Factor or New Mutants yet and was planning to read them at another point in time, must I read those tie-ins for the whole story? 



















 No more than ten members for each team. 














 I think it'd be interesting to see what the users of Reddit rate as their favourite films. Everybody could pick ten films and then we poll the results together and put them into an infographic. We could ask people to write a little bit about each film (must be optional) and use quotes from Reddit users to describe the film on the infographic. Would anyone think this is a good idea? 




 I want to read it, but I am unsure. I wasn't really a fan of his Ultimate Fantastic Four stuff. 



















 I've been reading through Modern X-books starting with Grant Morrison's New X-Men and I'm unsure which Decimation tie-ins are worth reading. Anybody know?

[Apparently this is all of them.](http://www.comicbookherald.com/the-complete-marvel-reading-order-guide/guide-part-5-decimation/)

 I've read most of his work, but I'd like something similar to Daredevil and Wolverine written by someone else (ideally with equal art abilities). Something ninja-like. 




 ... Who would you like to be on the team? Who would you cast? Who would you like to write and direct? Which storylines would you want them to draw from?

Personally, I'd love Joss Whedon to write/direct it, but I think I'd think I'd prefer a serious movie written by Aaron Sorkin and directed by David Fincher. Not sure how well Fincher could do action, but he could certainly create a great tone that stays true to the core themes of the X-Men, whilst putting his own dark spin on it. I think that Mark Millar's Ultimate X-Men run would be perfect. Tonally, it could easily mesh with Sorkin's dark and edgy writing style.

Alternatively, a visual director like Sam Mendes could really do spectacular things with the mutant powers and - unlike Fincher - we know he can direct action well.

My team would probably be Angel, Beast, Colossus, Cyclops, Dazzler, Iceman, Marvel Girl, Morph, Nightcrawler, Professor X, Rogue, Shadowcat, Storm, Thunderbird and Wolverine. Morph and Thunderbird only exist to be killed off quickly. No idea who I would cast as them. 




 Thor? Angela? The Winter Soldier? Superior Iron Man? All-New Captian America? Deathlok? Ant-Man? How are these and any others that I missed put on? 




 I'm thinking about rewatching Avatar again, but I've seen it a couple times already and I was wondering if there was another - prefably shorter way to watch it? Does someone either have an alternative watch list or like a list of about 30 episodes I must see trimming out some filler? 









 ... is that we're getting a Jessica Jones series. I'm currently reading Bendis' Daredevil (which everyone should read as it's one of the best things I've ever read) and it's clear the biggest street level heroes at Luke Cage, Iron Fist, Daredevil and Spidey.

www.imgur.com/NQaVCfih.jpg

If Marvel had the rights I'm certain Peter would have taken Jessica's place in the Defenders and she would've just been a side character. Now our beloved Jessica Jones is getting all of the attention she deserves. Moon Knight on the other hand...

 I'm surprised when I hear that a book like The Walking Dead sells 70000 copies, but then the show can get about 17 million viewers. Why don't comics ever reach numbers in the millions? Especially with the success of the films, why are comics still considered a "nerdy" hobby rather than just another medium like a book or a film? Will a comic ever sell as many copies as X-Men #1 again? Why not? Do Warner Brothers and Disney need to make an advertising push for comics or is it not worth them bothering? Why are comics being used to advertise films rather than the other way around? 




 I just had a couple comic book questions that I felt like I needed to be answered. And I wondered if anyone else had any other questions that we could get answers for.

My first question is the title. My second is does anyone still write comics using the "Marvel method"? 




 They don't have to be traditional members of the league.

Mine would be:

* Nightwing
* Shazam
* Martian Manhunter
* Green Lantern
* Green Arrow
* Animal Man
* Swamp Thing 



















 I was watching some of the DC animated movies and I was thinking, lots of people would love to see adaptions of their favourite arcs in the MCU, but it's unlikely. I thought a cool alternative would be to have canon straight-to-DVD or TV animated films that adapt arcs into that continuity.

If this happened, what arcs would people like? 
























 Is he a serious hypocrite or is this just an oversize by the writers. 




 In the past two years Robin died, Nightwing faked his death and went undercover, Batgirl lost faith in Batman and moved away, Catwoman became mobster and Batman Incorporated was dissolved.

I guess this truly is the death if the family. 
























 As she's a mutant does this mean Fox own the rights? Does that mean we'll never have a decent Squirrel Girl movie? Why wouldn't they through her into Infinity War? I'm sure she'd be very helpful up against Thanos. 









 And why? 




 I haven't played Minecraft since early August. The last big thing that happened was TE4 being released. What's new since then? Any notable new mods updates or packs? Any modders "quit"? RedPower 3 released? What has gone on? 









 Maybe it's a tad early to be predicting who's going to star in the Phase 4 movies, but who would you like to see starring in one of those upcoming movies?

I'd really like to see:

* Kamala Khan as Ms Marvel
* The Runaways

Also are there any sequels or spin-offs people are disappointed weren't announced? I know many people were expecting another Hulk movie, but I really would've preferred a Hawkguy movie. Fraction and Aja's run has been so delightful that a film version would just be the icing on the cake.

As for TV series I'd love to see Punisher, Moon Knight and Ghost Rider. 




 Does Marvel Unlimited contain anything from the MAX and Icon imprints? I can't seem to find anything. 




 Now that it seems awfully likely that Sandman is getting a movie, who else from Vertigo would we like to see?

I'm expecting the typical, Hellblazer, Swamp-Thing and Zatanna lot, but who else? How would these movies be connected also? Would their be a shared universe for them or would they stand alone? Would we expect a Justice League Dark movie?

I know he's not a Vertigo character, but Jonah Hex sort-of matches the tone. I also feel he's due a decent movie. 




 L'Etranger, Your Eternal Reward and The Dead Ringer. You're welcome. 









 I've just finished reading it as someone recommended it as an introduction to the franchise, I have to say I really enjoyed it, but I can't imagine how it could fit in with what Stan Lee wrote. Could someone explain it to me?

Also, Uncanny X-Men: First Class - when should I read it? Where does it fit into Claremont's run?

 Are there any books that go well with Morrison's run? I was thinking Stephanie Brown's Batgirl series, Batman and Robin (volume 2) and Snyder's Detective Comics would compliment Morrison's run well. Is there anything else that I should read additionally?  




 Obviously the Arkham Franchise isn't canon in the comic continuity (pre/post-Nu52), but the games share a lot of similarities with B:TAS (especially the voice actors). Is there any truth in this? 




 I've never played Project M, but I'm curious, what are the differences that make Project M better than Brawl? I've kind of lived under the assumption that it makes the game more about technical skill making it less accessible for casual players, but much more competitive. Would this be about right? 




 Well, I haven't thought this out to much, but I'd love to hear what people think. Idea contributions are very much welcome.

Here we go:

- Based off either Attack/Defend or Control Points


- The twist is you can only play as a Spy

- The only items you have equipped are the L'Etranger, the Dead Ringer and Your Eternal Reward.

- Madness ensues. 














 Where in volume form is it all collected? The one on Amazon misses out the last four issues in Justice League and I'm not sure where they're printed. Are they in the Justice League volumes or what? 














 What would /r/ERB think of Spartacus vs Kunta Kinta? 




 I've been wanting to get into Marvel Comics for a while now and I hear Marvel has an online subscription service for comics.

I have two questions. Is it worthwhile? And is it available in the UK? 




 We've already had two Spider-Man origin movies. My fear would be that people wouldn't want to sit through another spider bite movie.

My proposal would be to skip a year into Peter's career as Spidey and have him already established as a hero. He could recall what happened to Uncle Ben and the bite briefly and then move staight into the web-slinging action.

Of course this is an idea if Disney had the rights. Thoughts? 









 I just finished reading Batman: Earth One. I thought it was a very enjoyable read, but I'll admit it had one very fatal flaw. It doesn't feel like a stand-alone novel. I feel it would have worked so much better as a long running series. Does anyone else share my views? 




 [Tis good.](/spoiler) 




 Is it plausible that Marvel Studios will make an original movie for a change? They seem to have been following pre-sold franchises (some that honestly don't fit into the rest of the MCU very well). Is there any chance that they could make a new movie about an original character?

Edit: What I'm really asking is, if they made one, could it possible be good? 









 Is anybody here capable of and willing to help me with MineTweaker? I wanted to create my own modpack and I collected permissions for all of the mods, but I realised that there was nothing that set this group of apart from a big, bloated pack like Monster. What I decided to do is use Minetweaker to edit the recipes of certain items to unify them (like Mekanism machines use TE Machine Frames).

Is anybody willing to help me with this? 




 When I load up, Minecraft with MineTweaker none of my additional recipes have changed. Does anyone know why this is?

 I'd like to but a request through to take them to court. They broke the one rule. Drew tricked me into going into Yokay's base and using Yokay's MFFS to take my items. They gave it back afterwards and insisted they were joking, but Drew has a reputation so I find it difficult to accept that. Also they didn't apologize. Then they accused me of not being able to have fun. In what way could that be fun for me? Explain that?

Drew and I have had back and forth bickering for a while and we've both agreed we're feed up of it, so on multiple occasions we've agreed to make peace. Since then, Drew has slayed me with a sword, taunted me with false gifts and done this. I'm fed up with this. I admit I may have kept up the rally before, but never doing anything directly harmful. I have links to the only bad thing I've done to him in the past week.

http://gyazo.com/6915b9540d0ec31e2a27f9b772ecad1b
http://gyazo.com/25b0f5b72a4885887b57a22a442e48c3

As you can see in that last picture Drew said some offensive things that greatly displeased me as a homosexual. It's already difficult being gay without having to put up with bullies like him.

If anybody wants to hear Drew's motives for breaking the one rule here they are: On his first day he came to mine and Syrenn's base. Does he not know not to come into the ginger bread house? We killed him and ate his flesh (Sai only was involved in the eating of flesh part). I personally think it's fair enough for him to get mad, but he repeatedly takes it too far. However after this he comes back at our request, we give him all of his stuff back, but then he stole a sword (a precious iron sword called Jeremy Irons). This angered us so we told him to get out and never come back, calling ourselves even as that blade had sentimental value. Then Drew continues with the teasing and the odd homophobic remark; which he could probably get away with if he was 11.

Please can we ensure neither of us conflict again. I'm fed up of constant conflict.

Edit: Recently Drew said this: http://gyazo.com/9924b77f0f2c02cda8b82a8a849e8ee7

Edit 2: Also take not I deleted some Mystcraft stuff of his.

Edit 3: I'm no longer mad at Drew for his homophobic remarks. Maybe I was being oversensitive and also Drew apologised. He insists he's not actually homophobic and I'm inclined to believe him.

Edit 4: I sarcastically said this, don't let Drew use this against me: http://gyazo.com/e3f450b2ab5708d5250e598b8382eafc

Edit 5: I redact all bad things I said about Yokay, he's cool.

Edit 6: Look at what Drew put at spawn: http://gyazo.com/db97115890e481d4635d75e6033d55d9 




 Is it possible to change this line in the Logistics Pipes configs to true?

 # Enable Support for TE conduits to allow them to connect LP pipes.
 # This feature MODIFIES TE. That means that bugs inside TE could be caused by LP.
 # DON'T REPORT BUGS TO TE WITH THIS FEATURE ENABLED.
 B:TEPipeSupport=false

This will work on servers without having to edit the client side configs. 




 Will the server have to stick to the TPPI pack exactly or is it possible extra mods may be added? 




 Does anybody have a config for RI that is compatible with TPPI? It's become a pain to install because of all the conflicts. Anybody preserve through this task and have a config to share? 




 What does Immibis Microblocks add to the pack that FMP doesn't? I'm not sure what Immibis Microblocks does exactly, I assume it's just like FMP, except worse mod support. 
























 I'm fairly sure Clark was supposed to be Jesus, not God. Neither really made sense to me though - I always saw him as Moses. 




 I want to say Stane, but his relationship with Stark wasn't developed enough and he turns into a Saturday morning cartoon villain at the end.   




 [It's a great one as well](http://imgur.com/a/L7zDu) 




 Neutral. The funny guy is always neutral.  




 I'd argue he's had some of the greatest artists - Miller, Maleev, Queseda, Mack, Lark, Aja, Samnee, Rivera and Romita JR (in his prime) to boot. 




 Stan Lee's was only really mediocre. Not his best work. 




 That 2Pac/James Brown mash-up! I love it. Shame it was misused in the actual film.  




 It was too early for this. The IMDb scores haven't settled yet.  




 From Dusk Till Dawn 




 Watchmen - a panel by panel adaption of the comics with the depth of the characters taken out and replaced with poor acting and an emotionless ending. Anything remotely clever in the movie is pegged from the comics, but there was cleverer stuff in there that they ignored. I dislike Snyder's visual style very much and the movie ended up looking like one of the numerous comic imitators of the 80s. Gilliam was right - it was unfilmable. 




 Nope, just look at the plethora of good Stephen King movies. 




 I think the final battle was flawed, but only because I found it ridiculously boring, not because of excessive property destruction. I would have liked to have seen Supes saving people though. 




 Y: The Last Man - it is my go to comic for proving that comics aren't for children or cape enthusiasts and don't have to be dark and edgy to be great. The characters are great and binge reading it reminds me of binge watching a season of an excellent TV show. The dialogue is smart and quippy and the plot - whilst a riff on a Mary Shelly novel - is quite original in this modern age.

I'd easily recommend it other one of Bryan K Vaughan's other works like Saga - which continuously falls into the trap of "we're allowed to do anything, so we shall." 




 It doesn't really get great until the Omniman twist, so I'd say read a bit beyond that.  




 Daniel Craig working with Chad Stahelski and David Leitch of John Wick 




 The dialogue is probably the only thing bringing it down or me (although I'd rather there were more Fantasy element). 




 His review of the Raid disappointed me as well. 




 First Class... 




 Iron Man 3 - I already enjoyed it the first viewing, but I didn't realise how great the character work in that movie was until it was pointed out to me. 




 I loved him in the Walking Dead.  




 Animal Farm (1954) holds up really well. It's not as good as the book, but is very faithful and as a result retains the intellegence of Orwell's writings. 




 After watching it, I get so many more references. 




 Toy Story 3 - not sure which is more emotional, the toys all accepting death as they enter the incinerator or when Andy realised he's too old for his toys and gives them away.  




 The dogfights in Serenity are absolutely beautiful, but his dialogue - whilst I am a fan of it - won't match SW's tone at all. 




 3.8 




 Ferris Bueller's Day Off 




 Another fun fact: Mysterio tricked Daredevil into thinking a newborn was the devil and it drove him nuts.  




 I'm quite find of a run from about a decade ago where he became a teacher. 




 The open ending gabe me an Empire Strikes Back vibe.  




 Emily Blunt 




 Unfortunately. Jeph Leob at his worst. 




 It's a toss up between Moon and Dredd. Both are underrated gems. 




  Physical. 




 Have you grown sick of it?

I love it, but I'm a but of a Matthew Vaughn fanboy so... 




 Oh.  I thought /u/JosephFurguson meant a comic. I love his comic work. 




 What work of his was rejected by Marvel/DC? 




 I'm not sure. For me, it's a toss-up between Fargo, True Detective and Hannibal. I wasn't a big fan of Fargo's convient ending TBH. 




 In related news: I hear Kelly Sue DeCormick is getting a TV show.  




 I don't get the "style over substance" argument. Film is a visual medium - style is substance. 




 To everyone who complained about her lack of action in the last act I say: she was pregnant. It would have been so difficult to make her do anything substantial. 




 It was probably a reference to whatever movie Star Wars nabbed it from. 




 Lord of the Rings - hear me out. I wasn't really enjoying it from the get-go, but I was watching it with a group of friends who kept insisting the next part of the trilogy was better. The films did get progressively better, but they still weren't *that* good. I was largely bored and uninterested in the characters, the only thing that really interested me was the lore. As a result, I felt like I wasted 9 hours on mediocre movies (and I know I could have skipped the last half-hour of Return of the King). I appreciate the love and hard-work that went into making them, it just didn't click with me.  




 It's cool. I was just saying I'd find one of those series getting a movie more interesting, the same way I'd find a Good Omens movie more appealing than a random YA novel that was enjoyable, but not that great. 









 I never thought Marvel had anything to do with the comics I mentioned - I was making a point about CBMs in general. 




 I agree with you on everything, but generalising CBMs. I agree that some people are getting tired of Superhero movies, but I bet those people would kill to see more movies like Sin City, The History of Violence and V for Vendetta (even the Zack Snyder movies I'm not a fan of).

There are so many great comics I'd rather see get an adaption than a C-list Marvel hero - I say this a massive Marvel Comics fan. I'd like to see Maus, East of West, Saga or Y: The Last Man come to the big screen before Ant-Man.  









 Prometheus doesn't even have a bad score. It's not as bad a movie as people make out. Still not great though.

Edit: I'm not too found of The Good Wife. Can I blame Ridley for that as well? 




 I actually think his writing is better when he has another creative (not writer) who can match him. I think Brad Bird is just the guy who can give us that. Though the trailer for Tomorrowland did nothing for me, Bird has made it my most anticipated film for the rest of the year (more so than Star Wars or Ant-Man). 




 I prefered the Goldeneye N64 game, but Sean Bean was great in that movie.  




 That movie looks kinda cool. 




 I agree that they had some great films, but the Craig films are so much more accessible for a modern audience. I love those movies, but most of them are quite dated and may seem kind of silly. I think that might off-put people. If they really enjoyed Casino Royale and Skyfall, they should backtrack to the Connery and Moore films (I don't like the Brosnan ones - the dialogue in them is pretty poor). 




 If you must watch any two, watch Casino Royale and Skyfall. Casino Royale is a well-crafted thriller set to a backdrop of an extremely high-stakes poker game and Skyfall is a beautifullly shot thriller  about a man rebuilding himself after a great loss. Both have great action setpieces and surprisingly decent character work, but what makes them really great is watching the world around Bond change and grow. 









 That's not remotely true. The anti-Marvel circlejerk is just as bad - maybe worse - than the pro-Marvel circlejerk. I don't even like those movies, but it annoys me to see them hated on it that way. 




 Do you have a photo of your Justice League? 




 Demon in a Bottle, Extremis, Armour Wars, Doom Quest and The Invincible Iron Man by Matt Fraction. 




 IMO, Glover is completely wrong for Miles. Not only is he far too old, but personality-wise, he's much more in line with Peter. I get that he's an actor, but I think Peter would be a much more natural fit. 




 It's been pretty unpopular the last few years. I can only think of two points in this century people cared about them and that's when Mark Waid and Jonathan Hickman wrote them (I wish more people read the Dwayne McDuffie run) 




 Every cameo could be our last. We just have to make the most of them. 




 Thor: The Dark World. That was a fucking pretty movie.  




 Try following [this](http://www.comicbookherald.com/the-complete-x-men-reading-order-guide-modern-marvel-comics-era/) on Marvel Unlimited (only reasonable way to do this). It's missing several notable series though. NYX, New Mutants (volume 2), New X-Men (volume 2) and Mike Carey's run on X-Men and X-Men Legacy come to mind. Other than that, it's pretty comprehensive. 




 Nope 




 Agreed. 




 Yep! 




 Nope.  




 * Neo-noir flavour
* Borderline heroes/antiheroes
* Subtle, but meaningful political messages 




 I watched John Wick with my Mum and she was in tears when the beagle died. 




 The Birds 




 Or Matt Fraction's. 




 All the Iron Man films are great at this. 




 Well it's not looking good for either of those two in the New 52 either. Superman is a Superdick and Batman is... Well...  




 A more personal event. Now that these movies are so successful, they can experiment more with different genres. If the Avengers were tasked with saving people from a giant wave, how would that affect them. Would they experience survivors guilt or would they keep moving onwards? 




 Good idea.

RemindMe! 1,100 days 




 Nope, but that was a very fun movie. 




 Jason, Heracules, Argus, Asclepius, Iolaus, Medea and Orpheus are just a few members of the forever rotating line-up. 




 Yes for the Incredibles, and no on Kick-Ass. I actually think it's his worst movie, but I still really enjoyed it though. 




 I don't think I can give an explanation that can rival some of the other users on this thread, but can I recommend John Ostrander's Suicide Squad run? It has a different team to the movie, but I think that's the vibe they're going for. It's surprisingly good and worth a read. 




 That'd be pulp fiction at its finest. 




 16 and it is a toss up between Matthew Vaughn and Brad Bird, but I have favourites for both. 




 Saving Private Ryan. 




 Not a movie, but the play Journey's End is a brilliant depiction of it. Read the script if it's not showing as it's fantastic. 




 You saw him get tired after doing a lot of running. I liked that. 




 It is Phase 2. Some officials have said so. 




 Why wouldn't you include Ant-Man? 




 I think Quicksilver died because of licensing issues, not becauee he'd be too OP for Civil War. 




 Probably because they're poor ensemble movies. Even First Class, only really gave decent focus to three characters. 




 I'm confused as to why people think he's confusingly redundant. It probably has something to do with the fact he has no powers, which is to ignore the fact he's the team's tactician and has fought (and defeated) gods by himself. 




 [Unless it's the one where he releases a miniature version of himself from his palm. That one's awesome.](http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/newpower3.jpg) 




 Yeah, Supes is Invincible, but that doesn't make him boring - bad writing makes him boring. The best Superman stories involve moral conflict over his actions or the impact his presence has on other people. The bad ones just have him punch stuff for 22 pages.  




 That's disappointing. This is probably my favourite bit of the movie, yet they've revealed it before the majority of their audience has watched it. 




 The Winter Soldier has more relavance to the plot of Age of Ultron if that influences your decision. 




 Plotwise, The Winter Soldier is miles away from the comic arc, but it perfectly nailed the comic's tone. 




 If the same script for Inglourious Basterds was interpreted by the actors slightly differently, that movie would be terrifying. 




 Goodfellas, Casino and The Wolf of Wall Street 




 Interstellar and WALL*E 




 I read it this weekend and loved every page, except the ones with Tom Foster. 




 It was kind of forgettable. It was just a really heavy-handed excuse to get people to side with the Hulk. World War Hulk is a great story and worth a read (along with Pak's other Hulkcules works). 




 World War Hulk 




 So we'll find out who Danvers is played by this tike next year, probably. I'm excited to see more Josh Brolin. He's a fantastic actor with a great screen presence. Even in his more minor roles, he's almost always the most memorable character. 




 I hope they do more Marvel Colours books. They were the best retellings Marvel has done. I hope they do an Iron Man: Silver or a Fantastic Four: Purple.  




 Is it me or are Iceman, Spider-Man and The Human Torch all the same person? 




 In the comics, weren't the Chitari just a Skrull crime family? 




 Yes and I'm saying Marvel Studios, Warner Brothers, Fox and Sony need to mix it up much more.

You can either make Wonder Woman a boring, female Superman or you could create a Game of Thrones-style fantasy world for her to inhabit and have her face a more personal threat.  




 I think the big problem here is that there isn't much on screen variation between movies. They're mostly pretty similar. If you read the comics, you'll know there's so much more that can be done in the genre than is being done in the films. 




 This has happened in TV. Before The Office, having a laugh track was the norm and now shows with laugh tracks - typically - aren't considered as great. 




 I think it's crucial to show superheroes actually saving people. I think it's kind of a "save the cat" moment. Age of Ultron does it surprisingly well. 




 The few friends of mine who read comics IRL thibk it's great. I think it completely slowed down the Bendis era (my favourite Avengers run), but set the Avengers in a interesting direction afterwards. 




 The whole DnA saga deserves a read. I'd say he should Definately read Thanos (2003-2004) and Annihilation a read first. 

[Here's a pretty decent reading order](http://i.imgur.com/FUM3v.jpg) 




 Astonishing X-Men. It's written by Joss Whedon (writer-director of Age of Ultron) and drawn by John Cassaday (who Disney had enough faith in to allow him to draw Star Wars). It features lots of quirky one-liners, great characters and a very similar team dynamic. It's 24 issues, then a Giant-Sized special.


If you have Netflix, I recommended giving Firefly a watch. It has far more in common with Age of Ultron than you'd think (beyond Joss Whedon). It's 14 episodes, then a two-hour movie. 

Edit: I feel the need to explain myself - despite, the fact no-one has explained why they disagree with me. Astonishing X-Men is the comic equivalent to Age of Ultron (which I've seen). It includes heavy themes, but handles them with genuinely funny humour and has a well-balanced cast of characters that is so perfectly Joss Whedon. There is no comic that comes closer to replicating the feeling of Age of Ultron in my opinion and frankly, it's better than a lot of other comics recommend here. Yes, it does star the X-Men, but it should still excite you so much more for the film than reading the (equally great) Hickman run as it's closer to what you should expect from the film.  The same goes for Firefly.  




 Or the first to show what a bad mother fucker Thanos is. 




 Sorry, but I think Fox own the Phalanx. 




 It's an Archie Comics reference, yes. 




 Shaft, starring Michael Cera. 




 Throw in Spider-Woman and you've got a badass team. 




 I thought she was 19 in the Ultimate Universe.
