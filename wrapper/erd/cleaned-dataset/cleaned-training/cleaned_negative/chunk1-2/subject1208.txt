 Correct me if I'm wrong, but that's kinda the fucking point. 




 Wait, why? Because other people are writing the material, or because no roast material will ever come close to what Kat had for Flava Flav? 




 Exactly what I thought. Running up to the big guy like "He's scared! He can't fuck with you, dude!" Probably going to be yammering away next to him for the rest of the day, pointing out other skinny kids: "You could take him, Mike! Is it cool that I call you Mike?" 




 Ugh. I mean, I get as much of a kick out of the fat acceptance movement as the next guy, but I sure as shit don't hate people for it. It's just flat out hilarious. "Look at me, I'm beautiful!" Ok sweetheart. Keep telling yourself that.  




 I had no idea we didn't like her. Quick, someone tell me why I should hate her too!

 When did the Marine Corps get involved? 




 Whaaat? I thought this was fucking fantastic! 




 EVERY GODDAMN TIME.

"Honey. Honey. Go gown on me."

"Have you showered?"

"Yeah of course."

*sniffs*

"Nope."

Damn you, ball sweat. 




 Yeah. That's why I consider it a very poorly executed good idea. 




 It depends on what kind of writing you want to do, but for most creative stuff you'd want to **start simple**. 

I started with American lit, Kerouac, Thompson, Twain etc. Their stories are accessible, entertaining, and well written. Diving straight into the REALLY good stuff, especially writers like Vonnegut, tends to discourage beginner writers because they are such masters of their craft they make it appear dead easy. So easy you think there's no way you could ever fucking come close it what they do. It's not easy. And if they had felt that way, they wouldn't be the writers they became. Writing is fucking masochistic when you get down to the nitty gritty, and the best writing will convey the exact opposite. I can't tell you the amount of times I've put down a book after reading a sentence and thought: "Well fuckit. Guess I'll be a teacher now."

After that, I'd say stick with writers that are generally praised for good writing. For masterclasses in novel writing, my top recommendations are Gravity's Rainbow by Thomas Pynchon, Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad, Lolita/Pnin/Pale Fire by Vladimir Nabokov, anything Dahl (seriously), Hero of a Thousand Faces by Joseph Campbell, Slaughterhouse 5 by Kurt Vonnegut, and probably many more that I can't remember right now.

OH.

And A Farewell To Arms. Hemmingway. I have a first edition and it's far and away my favourite book. 




 This is great advice. Also, never ask a writer to edit. I was constantly asked to help with people's papers in college. The guys never took my suggestions seriously because it assaulted their pride, the girls just fucking cried.  




 In novel writing this would apply. Depends on whether you want to go down in history or make a buck. As a reporter, you're doing it for the history. You are providing your society with a fair and accurate account of events (ideally). You have no place in deciding what the people want. I've published a few big stories in my time and they've resulted in fundamental, tangible change for the better. But you can bet your ass I was dragged through the coals for it.  




 Definitely. I was a hockey goalie for a season. Lots of contact. LOTS of hate. Few things as satisfying as a sneaky slash to the back of a guy's calf as he's screening you. 




 I've found that this ESPECIALLY applies to writing on a deadline. In fact, writing on a deadline is where I learned this the most. "Don't be afraid to write a shitty lede." Chances are if you're writing on a deadline that requires such precision, you're already a good writer. So "shit" is relative. If I have to have 1800 words in quick, I disregard all thoughts of structure or my lede, parcel the story out, then arrange it in an informative and, hopefully, captivating structure. Then go through and tweak each paragraph so it has a smooth, logical flow.  




 That never worked for me. Personally I prefer to write sober, edit stoned. 




 Yes x1000000. He puts it way better than I do. I wrote a screenplay called "101 Banditos" in my teens. I shudder thinking about it. It was.... I can't. It was bad. Really bad. BUT. It was about a former slave turned bounty hunter in the wild west... Now I look at it as one of the best ideas I've ever had, just a very poorly executed one. 




 Hire an editor or bed a comp lit major. 




 Ehhhhh. I dunno. There's A LOT of shit out there you could do with avoiding. My mother comes to mind. 

Me: "Mom, have you read 50 Shades of Grey?"

Mom: "I don't have enough time to read crap, let alone 50 shades of it."
 




 I always loved it when a team had a good striker that I knew I had to be on point for. I suppose being made to score good goals is just as challenging and rewarding as being made to make good saves. 




 Me too......... How bout them Yankees? 




 I outline HEAVILY to avoid exactly this. I also smoke. And outlining and smoking go well together. 




 Nabokov's wife fished Lolita out of the trash. [I always defer to Ira when I hear this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbC4gqZGPSY)  




 You'd have to be a fucking moron to send something that reads like it's been written by one. The point is that you go back and make it better, ace. 




 Precisely! When I was in advertising, my boss wouldn't allow us to present an ad unless we had literally sketched out a thousand ads before it. He'd plop a fresh stack of printer paper in front of you and tell you to have drawn an ad on every sheet by lunchtime. The point isn't to sit around and think carefully about each ad. You scribble an idea as quick as possible and move on. Once you're finished, sift through the paper, pick out the best, repeat. 




 You're right. I wish that wasn't the case though. I had to read a lot of academic literature as a newspaper reporter and quickly realised I had no objective way of judging what I was reading. It was just too bogged down in a jargon I was totally unfamiliar with, and I didn't have the time to become familiarised. I think that's the problem with science and media right now. Neither industry makes much of an effort to communicate with each other in a way everyone will understand. The stuff that IS well communicated is usually the stuff scientists complain about getting stupid amounts of coverage.  




 Fun fact. My friend banged him in Vegas. 




  Pretty soon, you and your audience will like what you've written, as long as you have good taste.

FTFY

Pro writing tip #2: Read good shit. 




 I mean dont be afraid to write poorly. Don't worry about spelling mistakes (god knows F Scott Fitzgerald didn't. His editor was a goddamn saint for transcribing his scribble into books), finnicky grammar, poor sentence structure, insufficient conveyance of an idea. If it's slowing your progress, don't worry about it and move on. The most important aspect of writing is writing. Anything that stops that pursuit should be scythed off like a wart. 




 I've written professionally in television, newspapers, magazines, PR, and advertising for more than a decade. My number one piece of advice to writers (and this applies to all forms of writing, whether it's a cover letter on your CV, a college essay, or a novel) is don't be afraid to write like shit. 

Worrying over whether it's "good" or not is an exercise you save until you're done. Write an awful sentence. Shit, write an awful chapter. Mark it. Go back and change it later. 

This has served me better than any other writing tip I've ever come across.

EDIT: Do not write drunk and edit sober. Hemingway didn't do that, and besides, he's fucking Hemingway.

EDIT 2: Do what you want. I'm not sure I like the front page. Tis a silly place. 

EDIT 3: I'd love to respond to all the messages for advice and feed my ego, but the sausages popping in the kitchen are more appealing right now. Everyone asking for tips on how to get into writing, there's a reason that word is a gerund. Writing is something you do. Do it. If you don't know what to write, read. Simples. Stay gold, ponyboy.  




 All your mothers were seriously lax on manners. I'd get crucified for not greeting people properly. 




 Ah, so very true, but those were the greatest compliments! I'd get a half chub if a striker refused to shake my hand after the match. 




 As in players give keepers respect for good saves more than you might think. 




 Was a keeper through college. Nothing beats the satisfaction of this. Happened more than you'd expect. 




 I seem to remember hearing or reading somewhere that he had a writer for these kinds of speeches. Can any confirm or deny that? 




 That's exactly how the best interviewers do it. See: Robert Durst.  




 The all boy's middle school I went to would suggest otherwise. Nobody is stopping you and your buddies from gathering peacefully.  




 And now single! Hiyoooooooooo 




 Holy shit. Kenny vs Spenny.... now those are two names I've not heard in a long, long time. 




 Someone rang? 




 I had a one night stand the other night and once the willy came out the girl gives me this disappointed look and says: "I was told it was bigger." 

Long story short, there's a rumour going around that I have a large penis. I don't. Really not sure how to feel about it.  




 Well shit, that's a lot better than I usually get. Once was told I'm like an autistic Brad Pitt... 




 On YouTube, if anyone find my news presenting skills funny enough. I'm going to be a news anchor! Look out, Robin Scherbatsky!

 I have to get it cut in a few month for my new job (I'm gonna be on the tv!) Really, really not looking forward to it :( 




 It is fabulous, at times. Other times it's fabulously annoying. Dont get me started about driving with the windows down. 




 I will be the bouffant whore Reddit craves. Not because I want to. Because I have to. 




 Of course. But again, meet anybody involved in feminism beyond online flame wars and they'll agree men need better treatment in family court. I'd refer to RBG again on this issue.

...gender discrimination is bad for everyone. It also ends the stereotype of women as givers of child care and men as solely breadwinners. [We need to] tear down those barriers so a woman or a man could pursue whatever path in life they had the G-d given talent to pursue.

Also, it's "per se" not "say" 




 Also, a little teapot. Not that short. Kinda stout.  




 Fahd had just died and Abdullah was the regent. 




 I like the cut of your jib 




 Yissssssssssss. Fuck yeah TAL. 




 Seriously. Can we get a source on that? 




 Big props to the pastor. 




 I mean this in the kindest way possible, but please, try and reserve your opinions for when they are informed. I'm not from the US either, but I went to school there. One of my best friends is as gung-ho feminist as they come. She's a clinic defender, someone abortion clinics hire to help when people protest. What you see on the Internet is NOT feminists. They are people who talk about feminism. There's a big difference. Every gender studies, women studies major I've met has a firm understanding of the challenges men face and agree with me on all the standard MRA points. First wave feminism most certainly did not fix the outmoded gender stereotypes men face, just as it didn't do that for female gender stereotypes. I'd really encourage you to speak to real women who are actually on the ground doing feminist work rather than sitting on Tumblr complaining about cis male privilege.  




 Outmoded gender stereotypes? Have you ever met an actual feminist outside of Tumblr? RBG has done more for men in America than any other person. 




 My asshole dad refused to go to the doctor about his heart pains and died at 41 of a heart attack. Asshole. 




 What "right" has been taken away from you because of women? I'm genuinely curious. They are men's issues. They deserve to be discussed, absolutely, but the idea that women are leading the charge against us is retarded. 




 My boss would have thrown a book at me. Or whatever hard object is in his immediate vicinity.  




 Ugh. I wish I had an asshole dad. Well, any dad would be nice. 




 Only when my mother is pissing me off, for some reason. Usually though I just take it out on some fish or lobster. 




 It's really discouraging to see so many male-oriented subs go the way of women bashing. Even Men's Rights. I subbed because I thought we were going to discuss issues that effect men. Nope. It's a giant bitch fest about the women they all can't get. Even RP had an initial edginess to it, like you're approaching life as a predator. Nope. Bitch fest.

Can there be a sub for guys who like talking about guy things and have no problem with the women in their lives? Because right now I really don't think that exists. 




 I mean, that's pretty much how I react to stubbing my pinky toe. So I think mildly perturbed does it justice. 




 Hey. Let's not go allocating blame here. I think everyone is sorry, right? Right?  




 Anger and hatred? I'm mildly perturbed. That's all. 




 I... I'm sorry. I got a little heated. You said some things. I said some things. Let's put it behind us. 




 Your personal experience does not equal prejudice or racism. Prejudice is literally a preconceived notion based on ignorance.  




 EDIT: I have anger management issues. 




 What? C'mon now this is nonsense. I like the spirit of this sub. This is more RP crap.  




 Yep. Got detention as a kid for using it in that context. Didn't know it had an alternate meaning, so naturally the teacher wasn't too please I called him queer. 




 There's something oddly... non sexual about your pose. I have the most confused non boner. Awesome either way. 10/10. 




 Shut up, Scott. 




 I respectfully disagree. 




 Ah. So, like DBZ GT? 




 Yes, yes it is. Well done. And this is all from his wife, who has relayed it back to her uncle (my step dad) 




 Oh... Well I feel dumb. I thought the Star Wars stories went on, and these are just putting them into film form. 




 If I got the chance. They were supposed to come stay with us a few times now, but each time they cancelled because of filming etc.

From what I've heard, Adam starts out good, then turns bad, then becomes a Sith (I love Star Wars, just not that informed about it). Is that Kylo Ren's character arch?

 




 Just sharing what I heard. It's the talk of the whole company, obviously. 




 :( 




 I'm very curious to know how OP here has a pristine single page with an internet warning from the 90's... 




 I'm not saying a lower rate is a magic wand. I'd imagine you could marry a number of policies with it to incentivise companies into coming back to America, though. It's a pretty big subject for us in Bermuda, being a tax haven, and everyone's asshole gets a bit tighter around election time and we wonder what it would take for us to no longer be an attractive jurisdiction. And frankly, I don't think it would take much. Companies are far from peachy here. The IB environment has only just gotten friendly again after the ousting of the Progressive Labour Party in 2012, so we're seeing an uptick in new company registrations, but honestly myself and others really don't think it would take a whole lot to sink our economy and start floating yours. Take that as you will, I suppose. 




 There's nothing illegal about re-domiciling. That's why it's called a loophole.  




 Just the opinion of a guy living in the country where all your businesses domicile to avoid taxes, but I happen to think lowering the corporate tax rate would be the best way to start reeling in that lost tax revenue. They talk about closing the tax loopholes every election cycle and never do. Seems to me a good way to keep American companies paying taxes in America is to give them less reasons to domicile overseas.

 I prefer my women to be conscious when I disappoint them, thankyouverymuch 




 It was Halloween at Western University in London, Ontario, and my friends and I were hitting up an amazing burger join just outside of the bar we'd been drinking at. 

I go for a piss after ordering my food and find an apparently very drunk girl lying on the bathroom floor. I sit her up and try to get her talking, but all she keeps saying is "I hardly had anything to drink." She's pretty much incapacitated.

So I help her to her feet and get her out of the bathroom and sit her down at a table, then return to my friends and ask them what I should do. The logical choice was to help her into a cab, so I helped her back up again, walked to the street corner with her, and flagged down a cab.

Cab comes, but the girl is too far gone to even remotely remember where she lives and the cabbie refuses to take her. She manages to communicate to me that her house is on the road we're standing on and that she can point it out, but the cab driver still refuses to take her alone. 

A bit pissed, I get in the cab with her. She starts slurring about how she barely drank anything again, and then starts trying to kiss me, at which point it clicks that she's probably been drugged. I push her off me and she tells the cab driver to stop and that her house is right here. Cab pulls over, I go to pay him, and she bolts from the door and begins running down the sidewalk. "Ok awesome," I think. "I did my best." Nope. She stumbles and face-plants right into the concrete.

So I pick her ass up again, pretty frustrated with the whole situation at this point. She's bleeding from her forehead and yammering incoherently, but says her house is "right there." We get to the door and there's a party still going on inside. Her housemate answers the door, I tell him I "found her like this" and she fucking belts: "HE ROOFIED ME." Housemate clocks me in the nose before I can respond, sending me down the flight of stairs leading up to the door. Bang my head on the concrete. Housemate kicks me in the stomach, lays on a few more punches, and leaves me there.

Now drunk, concussed and bleeding from my nose, I make my way back to my res, find my resident advisor and go to the hospital.

I've never hated a slutty nurse so much in my goddamn life.

EDIT: Shout out to Western. You may remember me as the guy who ran around Saugeen with a boner, or that guy who unwittingly punched the stripper at the Beef Baron. Go Stangs.

EDIT 2: Ya'll motherfuckers need Jesus. Where I'm from, we help people in need of help. Yes it was dumb to get in the cab. GEE, THANKS. I know I fucked up. That's why you're reading this, turdblossom.

 Was the effect of 'yellow journalism' such that it truly convinced a nation -- that valued freedom above all else -- that they were justified in taking freedom away from others? 














 Court reporter here. Was speaking with a lawyer and he was telling me about the time he had to represent someone accused of having sex with a horse. "Did anyone ask why THAT horse, instead of any of the others?" I asked.

"Actually yes," replied the lawyer. "He wanted a stable relationship." 



















 Had an argument with my boss one morning. Was working in broadcast journalism and had set up a series of interviews with politicians to respond to a major story that broke over night. Except that those interviews I set up were being handed to someone else and instead she told me I had to go and talk to orphans and ask them how the economy was effecting them. I laughed, and said "No, Gary can do the orphan story, I'll do MY story, thankyouverymuch." At which point she launched into a tirade, belittling me and basically speaking to me like she was my mother. This has happened a bunch of times. I hung up and texted her. "Please don't speak to me like that again or I will have to quit." I got an immediate response: "Your fired." I was gutted. But as I looked at my phone again, a wry smile creeped across my face and my thumbs went into action....

*you'RE

We haven't spoken since.

**EDIT:** I suppose I should add that I was at my wick's end (EDIT EDIT: FINE. "WITS' END" YOU GLORIOUS PEDANTS) with the company and her as my editor. She was extremely unprofessional. What made this argument special was that she constantly told me I was not delivering enough stories of my own, that she was setting up too many interview for me. Naturally once I start doing this, she hands the best interviews of the day, set up by yours truly, to the chief reporter-- who has stopped talking to me after she handed one of HIS interviews to ME-- and sends me to do some filler about the economy. She was eventually fired and I have since been offered my job back. Twice. 
























 Frankly I think us men should no longer hide our erections in public. For too long now our erections have been oppressed by belt buckles and between our thighs, hurriedly tucked away lest anyone sees. Man will not truly be free until he can be proud of his erection, not ashamed and embarrassed! We get them all the time, for many reasons besides arousal. If a 'liberated' woman can walk around with hard nipples reading 50 Shades of Shit, why can't I walk around with a hard penis? I envision a new era, where penises are not judged by size or breadth or stamina, but valued as utilitarian assets-- a world where, when I get a boner on the train, I can stand with my erection proudly as a free man... 
























 I'm puzzled too. It was at +10 one second. The next it was at -14. Either way, I'll happily take the downvotes on behalf of /r/motorcycles. I don't know a single rider that isn't extremely cautious with their driving. I ride to avoid traffic, but I also ride for the exhileration. At no time do I mesh those two desires. If I want to satisfy my craving for [power](http://www.instantclarkson.com/) I go to a long stretch of empty road near the airport where I live. I even dated a girl that loved the whole motorcycle thing and pissed her off every time she rode with me because she wanted to go fast and I refused.  




 Spot on. I've had a handful of crashes, all but one of them have been because of someone else in a car. The one that wasn't, I ran over a nail that popped my tyre. I've got a theory that a lot of road accidents could be avoided by less restrictive speed limits, and the same logic applies to riding vs driving. In a car it's easy to switch off because of the feeling of security a car provides. If you're on a bike, you're acutely aware that you could go flying 50 feet in the air and land in a ditch if anyone makes a wrong move. Now who is going to be the more cautious driver? 




 On behalf of bikers everywhere, we know. The last thing the majority of riders need is a lecture on their own mortality. The majority of us are respectful and safe.

 I was more thinking of the post where OP used his dead father's last fiver to get a beer when he was legal. It was just a picture of a beer and a fiver, but as someone who lost their father as a teen, I appreciated the post. Begging for donations is different.

 Was in an emotionally abusive relationship for a while. Got out of it when I realized things weren't getting better. Turned out the entire time we were dating she was living undiagnosed with MS, which played a big part in her craziness level. Anyways, this won't be a popular opinion, but I think it takes a particularly weak person to internalise the emotional abuse they're getting. Both men and women. I couldn't ever take a word she said seriously because she was so clearly trying to say the most hurtful thing she could imagine. Why would you give a person like that the time of day? Why let their comments affect you? It never made sense to me.

 Drug treatment courts for non violent drug offenders are some of the most effective courts in the world. Their recidivism rates are miniscule.

 Building a stadium that gives your team an advantage over the visitor is standard practice among most sports. A lot more of the new stadiums in English football do this, not to mention everything they do with the pitch to get an advantage. Also, it's not against the rules. You can't get busted for smoking weed then point out the guy that's drunk and say what he's doing is worse.

 Yeah, it's way too friendly. She's putting up fliers though. [It was hanging around outside the day before.](https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfp1/v/t1.0-9/10858467_2822717327065_4298220802314223533_n.jpg?oh=a0b1480ae931d194c260b4d11ca9519f oe=5571DB34 __gda__=1437718069_d4bb51a56b02ecae4adb06b4e09abdb4) Guess he decided he liked what he saw. 




 I think Reddit is far past masquerading as anything other than what it is: the most influential website in the world. This happens with a lot of cultural movements, of which Reddit can certainly qualify. They start out with upstanding value systems that people gravitate toward. But the more people gravitate, the harder it becomes to uphold those ideals. Reddit gets more and more popular, requiring more and more money. In order to keep making that money to service the users, values are sacrificed. Goes for political parties, religions, you name it. I'm disappointed but wholly unsurprised. 




 This is my friend's business! Big up Evan! 




 Sorry, but no. Boston. 




 I dont know of many F1 drivers that haven't practiced from an early age.... 




 Thanks. Definitely going on my letter to Santa.  




 Bermuda, the land of pastel shorts, pink beaches, and nonexistent triangles.

That's pretty much what I had in mind. This is in the far off future, mind you. There's no way I could afford flying out to a driving school any time soon. 




 No, unfortunately. Her apt complex doesn't allow pets :( 




 THAT I can understand. Obligatory brush with death story:

 My days riding 50cc scramblers saved my life a few years back. I was going too fast around a blind corner and there was a van parked in the road. I swerved to avoid it but another car was coming in the opposite direction. I hit the brakes hard, locking up my rear which put the bike sideways, skidding straight toward the car. The moment I realized I was going to hit it head on, I let go of the rear brake and the bike popped up and straightened out, grazing the driver's side of the car and sparing my life. 




 Oh dear god no. Definitely not planning on jumping straight into an F1 car. I want to take a proper course and everything. And yes, I drive every day, but only ever under 60kph in beat up Opel Astra. Doesn't exactly hone your driving sense.  




 Unfortunately not. I live on a 21 square mile island where the speed limit is 50kph. Having a burp in an F1 car is high up on my bucket list though. I'm dying to know if I have the balls to give it some real welly.  




 Alonso might disagree there. Or Stirling Moss........ 




 That makes a lot of sense. Sounds similar to MotoGp. I guess what's tripping me up is just a general lack of knowledge for how it feels going fast on four wheels. I've always gotten my kicks on two.  




 I feel like that's probably a good thing. I've only ever seen a fedora worn well in magazines.  




 ? am I missing something? 









 Looks like he's about to dingle his dangle on the rim... 




 I used to be SUPER into swords as a kid. Went to Toledo for them and everything. I still fucking love swords, but man oh man have neckbeards ruined them for me. 




 mother of god. what tard kard put this report together? 




 Journalist here. Same thing applies, although it's not so much crying over really horrific shit, more the slow, painful realization as you slip deeper into the rabbit hole of life that nothing is going to change, and there's nothing you can do about it. That said, we do see some pretty awful road fatalities. I didn't think journalism would teach me what a kneecap looks like. 




 They were actually the OG truthers. Well, them and the sinking of the Maine. We've just forgotten about that particular conspiracy theory. 




 Exactly. I never understood this about fans wanting athletes to be upstanding moral paragons of sportsmanship. Players dive. They flop. They do anything they can to win. It's up to the people making the rules to ensure the integrity of the game is maintained despite this.  




 I mean... That's kinda exactly how America started 




 Or... y'know. [Get a cook book holder.](http://static.eatwell101.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/CUCINA-RECIPE-HOLDER-e1353950059213.jpg)  




 something something, Cotton... 




 Same goes for writers! 




 DEAR GOD. How did it get there???? 




 How is Sir David's mortality a problem? Really? You don't see the problem there? 




 Ya'll need to learn how to bullshit better if you're typing single words in at the end of sentences. Wow. 




 Ooooooooh dat thudding doe. Jesus.  




 It got a decent "heh" out of me. 




 There is a huge fucking difference. Words are just a fraction of the ways we communicate. 




 I'm the same way. I saw a thread about a guy wanting to commit suicide the other day and my first instinct was: "What a cunt, posting that online. I should go tell him to do it". I didn't, but I still wanted to... that's disturbing to me 




 Can confirm.

Signed, a criminally charming hobo. 




 If you'd like to boil it down to which measurement is used the most, I'd be willing to bet the entire trade and commerce industry might beat out the average number of Americans.  




 Now you just need to have JJ block a field goal... Good luck 




 Remind me how a few movie stars worth millions of dollars asking for my money to make another movie is important? 




 Fun fact: the "official" system of measurement in the US is actually metric.

EDIT for clarity: the metric system is "the Preferred system of weights and measures for United States trade and commerce". 




 The fact that she, armed with only a bachelor's degree in early childhood education, took over an entire magazine when her husband died suddenly, and not only kept the business afloat but managed to cut all our debt, rebrand the magazine, launch four more magazines, publish 12 books, find the most awesome, caring, creative man to love, and raise two kids all at the same time. She also rips mad bongs. Mom's an OG4Lyf.
