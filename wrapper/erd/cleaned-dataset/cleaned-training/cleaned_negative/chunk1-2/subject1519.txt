 In indian church we MUST clap. And honestly I love that part! 




 Generally using Head and Shoulder should suffice.

However, if it is severe then you can apply nizoral prescription shampoo that should take away the problem. 




 Eat insoluble fiber.

FiberOne cereal, an apple, etc. 

Fiber will make you feel full longer. 




 So what career choices did you make as a result of this?

Did your parents past work position offer any gains to you. Maybe getting into a good school or job, etc. 




 I love them 




 I think I just learned something here 




 Use ur floormat and put it under your wheel. This will give it something else to ride on instead of ice. 




 My suggestions :

1. Buy an egyptian cotton towel
2. Do not put towel in dryer, just hang them.
3. Wash by hand. 




 Well the reason I ask is because I've given gross, net, and just out of the wallet. This is how I have felt.

((Gross - net)*10% - Given to various charities of my choosing) + (net *10% to local church) -- Current approach -- Feel somewhat joyful giving this way since I can choose to give to charities I want to give to , but still feel legalistic. 
Gross straight to church - Didn't really feel joyful doing this so went with the plan above. Mainly didnt feel joyful because money was going to local church and the money was primarily being stored in the bank.
Net Pay - Loved this approach only because I felt how can I give more than I actually bring home. But was told that the proper approach is to give a tithe on gross. And well felt guilty, ya di yada.
Wallet - Felt great but always felt like I should given even more than just a couple of bills. Usually I don't carry to much cash.

That said, I think I can give at all levels, and I can surely say that God has blessed me over the years abundantly. 20K+ increase in salary over the last 3 years. So needless to say I am blessed for that. However, I miss the joyful giving that I used to be able to do. And I wanted to test out to see which approach is best. I believe NT approach is by your own will but 10% is def a good standard, and God approved :). 
So the reason for my question was mainly to see if people have tested out both theories and to see which one they like/enjoy, which ones they were most blessed with, etc. 

And to the fact of legalism, well maybe it is, but following Gods guidelines can ultimately change your heart. I mean heck i never thought I'd be able to give beyond my net, but I can, though maybe a little bitterly. And I'm only bitter because I know most of the money just goes straight to the churches savings account when it should be used to fix / maintain the church and to use it to help the current congregation increase their faith.  




 Ooh, I'd be curious for someone who teaches EDM music too. Fruity loops specifically. 









 When did you feel the most joy in giving?
During net, gross, etc. Also, why the variation. 




 How do you tithe? Gross or Net? 
Do you use 10% or another percentage?  




 Is there an app or any kind of utility that removes all non-hdr pics? 




 Yupp, just used mailstrom for something else and well its pheneomenal!

They can have my money! 




 I must admit that Mailstrom is pretty awesome at analyzing my email. Though for some odd reason it was unable to delete my emails. Though that maybe due to the fact that I deleted the emails in my system after seeing the analyzed report. I'm going to give it another try on my other email address. 




 What kind of API do you guys use? Reason I ask is because i was thinking about creating a similar app using MailSystem.Net. But since you guys already have a good software, well there goes my plans. 




 How would u teach christianity before jesus?

You would probably treated like the false messiahs of that time. 




 For reefs? 




 Well, my suggestion would be that if you want to understand your girlfriends religion then your best bet is to learn from her.

Ask her that you want to be part of her spiritual life and for that you want to learn whatever you can from her.

That verse couldnt have been a better choice. Those two commandments of Loving God and Loving one another truly embody the entire rules of Christianity. 

However, if you want to understand Christianity better on your own then read the bible. Start from one of the gospels, either Luke or John. The gospel will tell you about Jesus and pretty much what following Christ is all about (Christian = follower of Christ). Then you can go from cover to cover if you wish. But start from the gospel.

And of course, attend her church. The pastors job is to explain whats in the Bible (like that verse) and to take care of the people attending that church.  




 So when they demolish a building. Do they just throw everything to landfill. Or do they reuse it?  




 Yupp!

Even though I grew up as a Christian I still manage to have a fall out. A time where i searched to see if I really was a Christian or just raised up that way.

Though I did alot of stupid things during the fall out. I eventually realized that nothing in this world will give me the joy that following Christ does! :) 




 How does one start a redbox business?

How much does it cost initially?

How much can you make/month? 




 Why did you stop being Bourne?! 




 tl;dr Lenovo Yoga 2 




 wow. kudos to your dad!  




 I used it to cook my eggs today. They're Pun-omenal 




 SA would rather spend the time/money on providing aid to people than to aid colleges. Especially considering the cost of colleges these days. 
(my personal opinion) 




 So I used to joyfully give 10% of my net tithe. But over the years I started giving 10% of my gross tithe. But wasn't happy so I gave 10% of my net tithe to my local church and (gross-net) * 10% tithe to charities that I wanted to give to. Giving this way allow me to give both to my local church and charities of my choice. And its a great tax deduction ;).
Personally, I would rather just donate the net tithe because I don't see how giving on something you don't have makes sense. Not to mention most of the money I give to my local church goes right to the Bank for future storage rather than to take care of the place.

Though I haven't read Crazy Love maybe you should check that out. I understand you want to be faithful but the New Testament (from what I understand) does not require 10% but requires a cheerful giver (2 Corinthians 9:7) which essentially can mean less than 10% or even more than 10%.  




 lol 




 Thanks for using your talents. These are amazing! 




 "Do not be overcome by evil. But overcome evil with good" Romans 12:21

Was a verse centered on during a youth retreat and has helped me to keep doing good in the face of evil (or just general bad things). I probably need to face this verse again rather than getting lukewarm. 




 This is why I can't listen to Christian radio. Its the same song and the same artists for years.

KLove is a haven for TobyMac and Chris Tomlin. Not bad artists but every other song shouldn't be from them and it shouldn't be the same song they have been singing for the last few years.  




 Just wanted to say that this comment has made me re-view of what books I will buy down the road! 




 Thanks! Signed up for the course! 




 I'm with you! Stay strong! Seek a counselor. Thats what I'm doing. Preferably a christian counselor.

Also check out the app InstaPrayer if you have access to it. 




 For most programming jobs you will not need anything more than Algebra 1 or even basic Arithmetic. You will however need to pass at least Calc 1 to get a BS degree in CS.  




 I graduated few years ago but can't get over the fact that I never fully understood how proofs worked or for that matter any of the material that is taught in the data structures class.

I know major companies desire that their employees understand these concepts but I had a very difficult time understanding the material. We used an outdated textbook that was printed in maybe 1960-1970s and professor used examples of pascal to illustrate the various sorting algorithms.

Anyway, what I'm trying to get to is that is there a modern or maybe a simpler explanation / course / book that can explain all the terminology, concepts, etc. that one should have learned from a regular CS Data Structure course. 




 Wish I had seen this sooner. Sorry. 




 Is this worth it? Safe?

 sprite? 
























 I went on a Holy land trip last year and this was the only site after the Sea of Galillee where I really felt the Bible alive. Maybe it was because the Garden Tomb has a tour guide thats Christian. Idk lol but its much easier to imagine that this is where Jesus was buried.  




 So what do you do when someone you love stops loving you?

My ex and I faced this issue and thankfully we were just boyfriend and girlfriend at the time so no issues with kids etc. But there is a lesson to learn. How do you get your partner to love you again?

At that time, we decided to continue on but we eventually broke up. But if this situation ever happened in a marriage then it would have been a huge issue. So how do you keep on going assuming that you really want to keep on going?

**tl;dr**: how do you keep on going assuming that you really want to keep on going? 









 Happy palm sunday :) 




 I imagine this is easier to do between Canada and US 




 I agree with what you are saying except for the fact that countries like India or China would never have been exposed to Christianity without actualy missionary presence. 

Also, dont forget we're supposed to go to the four corners of the earth.  




 Yupp. I love it! I wish i had started earlier. 




 Im appalled at the amount of cursing thats going on in this subreddit. 

That said as a christian guy that just signed up for krav maga gym. I welcome this with open arms. 
The church has def taken away masculinity from man. Everyone just acts sweet. But man of God need to start being man of God!  




 Out of curiosity, what really drives the success of a missionary?

As in what factors best attribute to the success of a missionary on a mission field?

The quantifier (my guess) would be people converted and/or churches built?

Are there any studies that have been done.

This curiosity emerged because i was wondering if missionaries are more effective in a place they would love to be in (say maldives / bahamas etc) vs a place they would not want to be in (iran).  




 You should read the book "once an arafat man".
It wont convert you but it will give you the perspective of someone that has, plus its a great read. 




 This!

Yes, god did perform miracles on earth when he was here. However, he also said that we would be able to do even greater things.

And we have! Just think about the heights humans have achieved today. We have created robotic legs and arms (boston scientific), faster transportation, better health overall (just last week polio has been removed from india), and well many more.

The point is that God does still create miracles except now he uses the goodness in man to acheive these things. 

I know you're on this subreddit to troll. Needless to say, yes your question has been pondered by many but know that God doesnt necessarily want to change us from our weaknesses but rather uses other means such as the goodness of man or the change of behavior / thoughts to use our weakness as strength for his sake. 




 Any good flstudio tutorials? 
I bought the package few years ago and have no idea what im doing. 

My desire would be to create progressive house tracks / edm 




 Explain!!  




 Im actually considering a move to cali.
Can you elaborate a little more on the elitist atitiude. What exactly did they say to you? Etd 




 Theres a biryani tour? Lol whens the next flight to India. 




 I'm a programmer.

That said, i think we are going to have to make it affordable or even free. Sure we could make money out of this but I think we would have alot more indian guys and girls if it was free.  




 And thats why you're not a CEO jk

But a guy that can make JS in 10 days can also think sharply, create and manage concepts, and drive the companies focus a particular way. 

Though that doesnt always workout if people skills arent there.  But if you have some people skills then i think ull be fine. 




 Its at the Temple Performng Center tomm. However all tickets are sold out.

It might be live tomm though. 




 Sight And Sound Theaters produces stunning NY style broadway shows that are biblically based. Must see! 




 Anyone else going to TedX this friday? 




 Now thats a detailed response! Love it. Thanks 




 This kind of worries me because this could have Russia create a defacto monetary market, similar to bitcoin (or maybe upsell bitcoin). And basically create a one-world currency eventually leading to the mark of the beast, aka 666. Hmm. 




 Is there a list of these kinds of emoticons anywhere? 




 Theres one in philly too. Haha where all the skyscrapers are. 




 Best sky I saw was in Chichen Itza, Mexico.

Right about the Chichen Itza temple was a naked eye view of the galaxy. First time I saw it. I thought it could only be seen from space. Lol mind blown moment!!

I love star gazing. I live in Philadelphia and its so hard to gaze at stars. I have to drive an hour or more north to see a good collection of stars. Even then nothing compares to Chichen Itza! 

Any where in US where you can see the milky way galaxy?  




 Anyone have any idea why a chunk of the US (i guess mountain zone) is unoccupied unlike rest of the country

Unless of course its because its uninhabitable because there are mountains. Lol. 




 Capital Kings, or any techno for that matter.

Most techno songs should be just instrumental. 




 I've worked in asp.net and have worked primarily in java dev for the last few years. 

But im looking to get into these two jobs. Probably asp.net mvc more since i used to enjoy asp.net web forms. 




 This is someone elses site. I just started krav last week. And so far it seems consistent with what I am learning. 









 zulu? 




 They should really warn people on arrival about the costa rican departure tax. Lol thankfully i knew.

But a side story, i got pulled over on my way to the airport from manuel antonio. Lol after a lil bribing i was able to go on my way. Which is where the airport tax came in handy. Told the cop i needed to leave for airport and needed money for airport tax. Got away with paying $50. I think he wanted $100. Though people at the airport said i could have gotten away with $20. Lol.  




 Looking to dev in asp.net mvc or spring mvc. I was wondering if there are any startups looking to have someone on staff that would dev for them using these technologies?

Also, where does one post about a possible startup idea one has and pretty much assesing if its worth it, etc. 




 As someone who has lived in another nation. Let me say that the problem isnt that NSA tactics alienate us but rather the fact that US Economy is tanking. 

In reality most nations do respect USA and people would still love to move here. But our internal politics and disrespect for each other is ruining our image. And the wars that just took place didnt help.

But people will overlook all of that if we can be the positive nation and a wealthy nation that innovates and continues to provide peace as it has. But we will also have to show case it. We will have to show the world that bipartisan government can work. These constant fights between two political parties and the greed in Wall street needs to stop and change so that America can start moving forward again. Currently only the Wealthy are moving forward. The middle class and poor are having a hard time maintaining a job. 




 Has anyone else tried these and anyone know why they arent available everywhere?

My gym used to have these and then they stopped selling them. But they were great for workouts. Kept me going for 2 hours at a gym. Otherwise I would get very exhausted during workouts.

 By later he means when PS5 is released. 




 This is the main reason why tourists must go to Toilets in Mexico. Its called montuzemas revenge lol.

Mainly occurs because their water contains too much extra salts / chemicals to keep the water safe to drink. However our bodies havent adapted to that. 




 I second this. This would completely not go well in the Indian culture. 




 Which cruises have Indian food? 




 I had the same thing happened to me. And I learned a very important lesson. Always!! Buy a road hazard warranty.

I bought 4 tires 2 years ago. 2 of them went flat within the last 3 months. I got them replaced for $18/tire with an extension of the warranty for 3 years. Aka when the tire goes flat in 2 years i will have warranty to get a new tire for only $18 more.

This is through discounttiredirect.com.

Also, u dont have to pay the $18. They can ship the tire for free. Only thing is that u would lose out on the extended warranty. 




 I thought you meant the show. lol 




 Where are you coming from? 




 Thanks! Sermon recorded anywhere? 




 So the new mobile share value plan looks tempting.

Currently I am paying $181 with taxes for
500 minutes with Rollover
iPhone + Unlimited Data + unlimited text
iPhone + 3 GB Data + unlimited text
Basic Phone
------------
Total = 181 with taxes and a FAN discount of ($18)

Mobile Share Value Plan
-----------------------
Since we've had AT T before Feb 2
10 GB Data Plan $100
1 iPhone $15
2 iPhone $15
3 Basic Phone $15
=============
Total $145 + taxes - FAN Discount (23%)
Guesstimate totals : $120
(basing that on  ((145(1-.23))*1.08) [(total - discount)*taxes])

Did I get the above correct?
(not sure what the exact total would be....)

Now based on that it would seem that I would be saving roughly $60/month or $720/yr. 

If the above is true then what are the catches? And is it worth losing the unlimited data plan. Though I usually don't go over 5gb, its still a plan I would love to have to avoid any exuberant data charges down the road.

Please explain in the simplest terms below so that everyone can understand it. Thanks.
