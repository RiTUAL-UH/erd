 We have found our new Michelle Bachmann. 




 Let's get back in the saddle and pedal forward.   




 Good for you, /u/elzmuda -- there are always excuses to drink, but if you make the decision first thing in the morning not to drink TODAY no matter what happens good or bad, if you doggedly persist in the commitment, then alcohol is not an option.  I like to say that after I decide that I am not going to drink TODAY--alcohol is out of my movie for the day, all day.  




 Lady Lindsey is the last closeted gay male in politics. 









 Unfortunately, it was a widely-held belief that the alcoholic was immoral--if only he would take "the pledge" or "get religion."  The failure to make the choice not to drink was seen as sin.  It really wasn't until the late 19th century (Rush, Trotter 1760-1832) that a practical "disease model" and treatment emerged (Keely) although it was not widely known or accepted.  The modern recovery  movement begins as a radical reaction to the WCTU and the moral choice models--fully accepting the disease model of alcoholism.  Frankly, the anti-AA ideologues are actually preaching a moral choice model--without the moral-ism.   









 Many times, these sorts of local heroes become honored judges and courthouses are named after them. 
























 Of course, I've been there in my own special and painful way.  Most of us get where you're coming from and we want to provide support along the way. 




 Yeah, I remember that neuro-feedback loop when I was drinking.  When I went back to "moderate drinking" after 15 continuous years of sobriety I thought of course that I could sip fine wines.  I'd buy these $100+ bottles of aged port and I'd have the appropriate crystal glasses.  Of course, being an alcoholic, I'd hide all of my apparatus in crawl spaces and wait till everyone else in the house was asleep and pull out my port and sip my wine--inevitable waking up at 5 AM laying on the floor with empty bottles of port that I must have swilled down.  Did I need any more proof of my powerlessness?  And yet, I went on and on for 7 long hellish years. 




 Fine chocolates. 









 Like EVERYTIME. 




 In a discussion sometime last year, I told my pal, /u/offtherocks, about the great 19th Century English novelist Anthony Trollope who in 1858 published [Doctor Thorne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Thorne) which deals with the multiple episodes in the lives of recurring characters in something called the Barchester Chronicles.  If you are at all interested in literature, I can't recommend them highly enough.  In *Doctor Thorne* the title character treats the alcoholism of his friend Sir Roger Scatcherd who eventually dies from the disease.  

 But be this as it may, be it true or false that Sir Roger was most efficacious when in his cups, there can be no doubt that he could not wallow for a week in brandy, six or seven times every year, without in a great measure injuring, and permanently injuring, the outward man. Whatever immediate effect such symposiums might have on the inner mindsymposiums indeed they were not; posiums I will call them, if I may be allowed; for in latter life, when he drank heavily, he drank alonehowever little for evil, or however much for good the working of his brain might be affected, his body suffered greatly. It was not that he became feeble or emaciated, old-looking or inactive, that his hand shook, or that his eye was watery; but that in the moments of his intemperance his life was often not worth a day's purchase. The frame which God had given to him was powerful beyond the power of ordinary men; powerful to act in spite of these violent perturbations; powerful to repress and conquer the qualms and headaches and inward sicknesses to which the votaries of Bacchus are ordinarily subject; but this power was not without its limit. If encroached on too far, it would break and fall and come asunder, and then the strong man would at once become a corpse.  p.124

And here, Scatcherd on his death bed describing his fears relating to the effect of the disease upon his heir, Louis:

 "With my poor boy; with Louis."

 "If he [Louis] will let me, I will [look after him,]" said the doctor.

 "And, doctor, when you see a glass at his mouth, dash it down; thrust it down, though you thrust out the teeth with it. When you see that, Thorne, tell him of his fathertell him what his father might have been but for that; tell him how his father died like a beast, because he could not keep himself from drink."

 These, reader, were the last words spoken by Sir Roger Scatcherd. As he uttered them he rose up in bed with the same vehemence which he had shown on the former evening. But in the very act of doing so he was again struck by paralysis, and before nine on the following morning all was over.

In the characters and story of Doctor Thorne and Sir Roger Scatcherd I was struck at how sophisticated Trollope's 1858 understanding of the psychology of the alcoholism and the sufferer's powerlessness over the malady.  Also the powerlessness of that caring physician to help his friend. 






































































































































































































































































































































































































































































 When I got sober in 2009 after a 7 year relapse, as I saw it, I had the choice of killing myself and avoiding what was certain to be professional disgrace and a criminal prosecution over unfiled and unpaid federal income taxes or get sober and face the music.  In the years of my relapse the income from my professional practice was on a roller coaster.  Some years, I barely made any income and in at least one of those years I made a million dollars.  The unpaid and unfilled taxes were an abyss that I could not figure out how to address despite numerous false starts--of course, not being in recovery I had intentionally walked away from ready and willing help and support.  Finally I was at "fuck it, I'll just sit here and drink."  

Ultimately I suffered very serious professional and criminal consequences that included federal prison time. Some of the damages to my reputation and professional status (I lost my license) were permanent, but the criminal consequence has been long in my rear view mirror.  

When you own taxes in the US you might find that you owe reasonably $300,000 dollars and then through some black magic the IRS says your $300,000 indebtedness is now $600,000 and then time passes, even with payments and forfeitures, the IRS says you now owe $900,000 which is sort of where I find myself now.  In other words, my sole criminal offense resulting in a short prison sentence has become a life sentence as it relates to intractable debt and IRS collection activities including garnishments and seizures.  

When the collections nightmares first got underway the local agent that I dealt with suggested that I file something called an Offer In Compromise (OIC).  An OIC is a whole lot more than calling the IRS up and saying--here's a few thousand send me a release,  In 2012 I undertook the process and I was very close to accomplishing a deal when mysteriously (a common experience when dealing with the IRS) the rug was ripped out from underneath me. 

Leaving out lots and lots of the details, I determined to find out why.  I submitted a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request and I got my entire IRS file.  As a result I learned that the former criminal investigator in my underlying criminal case supplied misinformation which if I had had an opportunity to address I would have been able to supply documentation refuting allegations he made that disqualified me.  

Flash forward, to now, I just completed all the hoops, and I am greelighted to submit a new OIC (now complete) which my accountant believes stands a chance of success based on revised rules adopted by the IRS in 2014.  Also my employer is supplying funds to effect a deal if it can be done.

I write about this to let you know that I too struggle with life on life's terms and I don't drink TODAY no matter how frustrating, confusing, depressing, anxious painful or embarrassing those terms are.  I doggedly persist every day that I am SOBER which means, I still stand a chance.  Five years sober and I am still working on clearing away the wreckage of my past.  

tl;dr  CC has bad, bad tax problems; he doesn't drink; he overcomes obstacles; and, he hope that he may finally be able to clear away financial wreckage of the past.

Note: This was painful to write, but I promised to update a comment about my resolution and determination to deal with this issue. 















































































































































































































































































































































































































 The [Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) is a post that I published in several versions.  It's made up of information that helped me stop drinking and get sober + ideas suggested from among others, /u/offtherocks.  My pal, /u/Flow_Morpheous_Flow noticed a typo so with the need to make that slight revision I added a link to the daily check-in, too.  

So if you're **new here** I hope you will consider making the [Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) and [the Daily Check-in](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/checkin) part of your Stop Drinking routine. 







































 Here on the westside of Cleveland we have been in this wet weather loop for some days.  So the ground is saturated and where I live close to the edge of Lake Erie our storm sewers backed up and flooded our basement about 7:30 PM last night.  My son was temporarily residing down there and a lot of his belongings are lost.  Quick action saved it from being worse; but it's been stressful as I dealt with work, my son, the disaster clean up folks, the insurance company and the SO.  The pice de rsistance was when I jumped into the ice-cold shower at 5 AM because the flood knocked out the water heater.  I was able to successfully re-light the water heater before I went to SBUX to hang with the dude. 

So somewhat stressful day, but all in all it has worked out so far.  It worked out and I even got a bike ride in, met with some people on a work matter, and hung out on some on Reddit.  Compare and contrast with 6 years ago.  I would have absolutely exploded at the situation, resentfully responded to my poor family and probably sulked in my room sneak drinking.  Yikes.  

I am so glad I did not drink TODAY. 




 Welcome /u/TZ840 to /r/stopdrinking -- yeah, I wouldn't worry about telling anybody for awhile unless it's smart because you want to keep booze out of the residence, e.g. the GF drinks.  So at this [link is a post called the Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which lays out what I did to stop drinking and to get sober.  I hope something there will help you with "next steps."

Good luck and welcome aboard the lifeboat. 




 Congratulations, my friend on showing us that it can be done.  An invite to join us on /r/dinos will shortly follow in your inbox.  









 Good work, keep doing what you're doing. 




 Welcome /u/sarmst12 to r/stopdrinking.  When I stopped drinking I was fortunate enough to run into a friend of mine at an AA meeting and he sketched out the [some of the ideas that became the Baby Steps post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which gave me sufficient directions that enabled me to stop drinking and to get sober.  Now, I have shared them with you.

Good luck.

 Yeah, it's a total bummer.  I got up this morning to take a shower--ice cold water.  The basement flood extinguished the water heater.  A quick cold shower and I was able to re-light the water heater for the SO's shower so I got that going for me.  I meet the disaster clean-up people at 9 AM.   









 Great news!  Keep doing what you're doing. 







































 I'm curious, why? The knighthood? 




 I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; even if my basement flooded over night.  Oh noooooooo... 




 Great link. Thanks! 




 My agnostic AA meeting and our brief AA readings are highly supportive of belief and non-belief.  We do not bash religious belief.  Also, having said that there is one character who goes off (like the guy you called) while most of us just roll our eyes.  In my experience of having been the secretary and chair of many AA meetings over the years and  bearing in mind that usually the secretary is deemed by the membership to be the "sickest" person-- leadership do NOT govern meetings, they are there to serve.  

BTW, here's an AA [position paper to professionals on our many paths.](http://www.aa.org/newsletters/en_US/f-13_winter09.pdf)

Edits:  Yikes, I'm still not sure the above makes any damn sense, once again confirming that I should not try to comment before my first cup of coffee in the morning. 




 Welcome /u/purplepurple77 to /r/stopdrinking -- at this [link is a post called the Baby Steps.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) The post describes what I did to stop drinking and to get sober.  I'm pretty sure that it's a pretty good place to start the process of stopping.  Let me know.

And good luck to you. 




 [My **Saturday Share** is at this link. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/25u6cc/saturday_share_im_train_subject1576_and_i_am_an_alcoholic/)

By the way, I doubt that I will ever drink again; but even now I haven't "quit drinking," instead I make a renewable decision every morning that I am not going to drink TODAY.  In other words, I stopped drinking one day at a time.  That works pretty well for me.  It works much better than all those sober years ago when I told myself that I had permanently "quit drinking." 




 BTW, there is no SD limit on how many posts or comments you can make a  day ; ) 




 Good job, /u/Shawder11 -- progress, not perfection, but you did that perfectly.   




 Congratulations my friend, an invite to join us in the Dino-den will follow shortly in your inbox! 




 My friend /u/1literCC -- this gets increasingly astonishing.  I am so proud of you.  Whenever you hear that little voice, refer to this post.  113.86 gallons of alcohol not processed by your stomach, kidneys, liver, pancreas, bowel, bladder, and most importantly your brain.  Welcome back to life. 




 I'm not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad--in solidarity with you. 




 Thanks, I'll delete.
 









 I totally resembled that thinking process; until I stopped drinking and until I learned that sustained time stopped changed all of that into a process that looks something like this (sorry no pie graft):

Get up!  Make a decision not to drink TODAY.  Memorialize the decision by logging into the morning Check-in.  Do the simple things on my list for the day: coffee with friends read the New York Times; work, household chores, personal errands, recovery meetings;  improve my life.  Go to bed SOBER.  Repeat.  

The result is that my life when from ruination of health, wealth and reputation to a mainly happy, free and valued SOBER life. 




  Even now, writing this, part of me is ashamed and embarrassed that I would pray, but hey, it works for me.

Please, don't ever be embarrassed by this.  I am astounded by your courage in posting this.  I am positive there are many, many SDers who feel the same way you do and don't have the courage to admit it on the Sub.  Listen, my friend, many times I've been asked about my morning ritual and while it is true that I am a real agnostic and sometimes atheist--my re-written 3rd Step prayer is what I slide out of my bed and say every morning.  It works for me.  And before I go to bed at night I repeat it in gratitude for my sober day. 




 Here's where I was at 25 days in recovery: my wife was having an affair with her then (sociopath law partner); my daughter who was a high-school senior was newly pregnant; my son was trying out his gay-period as a high-school sophomore; and I would be going to federal prison for tax evasion.  In short we were living the whole dysfunctional American dream. 

Flash forward nearly 6 years: my wife and I fully reconciled (yeah, 27 year marriages are complex); my legal troubles are behind me (Orange is the New Black is my new fav Netflix series); my 41/2 year old grandson Riley is the light of my life; and, my son is knocking down theater awards including a rave review in today's paper for his "hilarious" performance as the Nazi playwright in the Producers.  

I'm sure what I'm saying is obvious: don't drink and life is one hell of an interesting adventure.  Even my feelings of betrayal and my broken heart healed with time.  Good luck to you. 




 Well if that's the binary, it's a no-brainer.  I'd trust HRC with IT, and not trust Rubio with making nominations to lifetime federal judge-ships, especially the Supreme Court. 




 Racheal Dolezal followed this advice and see how well it worked out for her?  




 True story: many years ago I had a client who was killed after being crushed by a casting at a steel factory when an overloaded crane collapsed.  Should have been a no-brainer workers' compensation death claim but on autopsy the pathology report noted 12 nanograms of THC.  The claim was disallowed because--my man was presumptively high.  I hired the leading expert in that era on the subject of THC intox who testified that he and other scientists tried to arrive at a scale of THC intox based on the blood-alcohol model and had utterly failed.  He indicated that there is no means of objectively measuring impairment from THC based on presence in the bloodstream.  I won my case.  Frankly, this should not have been an issue since my deceased worker was not involved in any operational respect as it related to the casting or crane that killed him, but why let a little logic get involved in depriving a widow of death benefits.  

 














 Welcome /u/SuckMyKaHawk to r/stopdrinking.  I hope you feel free to fall right in.  Check out the daily check-in post.  Oh, and here's the [link to the Baby Steps.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Good luck. 



















 Or your tie knot.   




 Yep 
























 I've been to lots of AA meetings over almost 30 years; and, I've been to a few crazy meetings, too.  Usually, I need to stay attuned to "the winners."   There are always two types of examples in recovery: good examples and bad example, but even the bad examples can be good examples if you know how to unpack the meaning.  ; ) 














 Imagine if the media covered alcoholism for the public health crisis that it is--it would make the horror over Aids and Ebola pale in comparison.

Thanks for the link! 




  I can't help but think that AA is doing me more harm than good, I do suffer from depression and AA seems to amplify that due to some of the self defeating and negative attitudes that go on in the room. I feel like I need self empowerment not self depreciation which I feel like is what some AA members preach.

I've never been to a meeting like this, let alone several meetings so that I felt that a pattern was emerging.  I have been in dark or depressed places where I had the reverse of rose-colored glasses on; and, I processed what I saw and what I heard in a way that lead me to believe as you seem to believe and which you ascribe as an AA message.  

But by all means, try a SMART recovery meeting!  I give you a lot of credit for persisting in seeking help.  Good luck.

 Congratulations on 300 days; in 2 months I look forward to adding you to r/dinos! 














 Also check out the Morning Check-in; it's how a lot of us ritually memorialize our decision not to drink TODAY.   




 So as outrageous and racist as this is--how is this not Free Speech? 


































 Yes, I did the [the Baby Steps, at this link.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) The Baby Steps are the things I did and do to stop drinking and to get sober.  Good luck.  I hope you get traction and join us on the SOBER journey. 




 I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; in soggy Cleveland I still believe: Go CAVS! 




 If you're not feeling well please call a doctor.  Otherwise hang in there, personally I have been there. 




 Welcome out of lurk, /u/runinjagal. Please keep posting as you go along. 




 I did the things I describe [at this link to a post called the Baby Steps.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  I still do these things TODAY.   




 We talk about this, but probably not enough.  I honestly can't think of a time in my drinking where I was happy with only one or two drinks or beers.  In fact given the choice during most of my drinking career between one drink or beer and not drinking at all--I'd usually not drink at all.  A single drink or two would simply set off cravings, make me uncomfortable, and make me more likely to flee a social situation to "feed my disease."  Personally a funny fact: I met my wife the night I was sitting at an upscale bar doing the crossword puzzle and drinking a diet coke.  I was "pacing" for that evening's drinking; it was far too early in the evening to do the kind of drinking I would end up doing that night.   




 That is totally on topic as evident from the responses.  Income inequality it the animating issue of both the Clinton and the Sanders candidacies.  




 I can say in hindsight, jumping into AA meetings helped me enormously with all of that.  Again, just my personal experience.  




 The political argument is about income inequality.  Of course, your comment is one of the arguments being made. 
























 P-e-r-f-e-c-t! 




 Well-done /u/mac_question it sounds to me like you're in the right place.  Let me share the [Baby Steps post with you](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which is a description of what I did to stop drinking and get sober.  Maybe some of the ideas there will be helpful to you too.  Good luck. 









 Congratulations, my friend! 




  Right now I am just thinking "I will never drink again." but then questioning that, because I've said that so many times.

If I were thinking that way I'd be lost too.  But I don't think that way at all.  In fact despite 2000+ days of continuous sobriety I still do it one day at a time.  At this [link to a post called the Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) I explain exactly what I did.

Good luck on finding yourself.  If you stay on this sub, I'll bet you anything that you will begin to find yourself.

 I'm so glad you're here, /u/hhhlo -- you are part of the whole. 




 REO Speedwagon and fans frozen in time circa 1978; but, sagely singing:

 Good for you; hang tough.  It's worth it.  

Listen, if this were easy there would be no alcoholism.  Heavy or abusive drinkers would stop or moderate--end of story.  Instead we lose hundreds of thousands of lives worldwide directly to this disease.  If ebola did this to our populations we would be in a worldwide medical emergency and we'd recognize the seriousness of what we are grappling with in terms of a health crisis.

Here's what I can say from my personal experience: active alcoholism was killing me; and, sobriety is a beautiful alternative ALTHOUGH in the early days of sobriety it often doesn't feel that way.  It took time for my body and brain to recover and worse I continued to believe that I was missing out on the party.  That latter piece of the puzzle is particularly dark--because that message is my old alkie thinking in the throes of trying to send me back into my disorder.  My answer: don't drink TODAY and trust the experience of others that its well worth the struggle because it is. 




 As a long time AA, I would encourage you to definitely make the effort to get to one of those agnostic/atheist meetings.  Perhaps you will find the person you think will be an ideal sponsor at one of those meetings.  In the interim I would for sure use the phone numbers and ask the same question you ask in this post to your friends.  Finally, pro-tip--when you connect with a running crowd of like-believers or non-believers you may well find a set of meetings that closely align with your belief or non-belief that are not advertised as agnostic/atheist meetings.  And, as you go along feel free to ask for help among your friends to start an agnostic/atheist meeting.  




 I quit smoking cigarettes 23 years ago using willpower.  I lost 60 pounds using will power.  I trained and ran a marathon using will power.  But I could not recover from alcoholism through willpower.  I needed a power outside of myself.  I found that power outside myself in the fellowship of other people in recovery.  I accessed information about my underlying problems; I received explicit directions to address my issues connected with recovery; I was supported in success and failure; despairing I had phone numbers to call; I found positive social activities that did not involve my former drinking milieu; I found a road map through the chaos of my pass; I discovered a way to objectively check my condition and progress; and, I found a purpose for my life.  None of these things were available to me via my self-will or willpower.  These directions came from outside.   




 Big lie. 




 Perhaps you misunderstand my comment on what I call the 4 goals or purpose of recovery (actually paraphrasing The Natural History of Alcoholism, at p. 365 Vaillant, Harvard University Press 1995).  Officially, AA does not have 4 goals.   In fact AA's official "primary purpose" is stated succinctly in the "Preamble" which is to stay sober and help other alcoholics.   





























 After I make my morning decision that I am not going to drink TODAY, alcohol is not in my movie.  This idea, this belief, this personal reality means other people's drinking has NOTHING to do with me.   




 In my experience true RECOVERY was not possible without help from outside myself. 




 ...or you create your own agnostic meeting and discover how quickly you attract fellow agnostic participants.   









 I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; I'm keeping Sunday SOBER all day, here in Cleveland! 




 What I'd try to do is remember that alcoholism is a well-recognized medical disease and TRY to treat my in-law with compassion.  More than even that I would remember that as an active alcoholic in the immediate past I personally was no prize to my wife and children.  Out of respect for my immediate family, I would practice love and tolerance of my troubled in-law during his brief stay.  

Most importantly for myself, I would continue to make the daily decision not to drink TODAY, doggedly persist, and above all remember that it is One Day at a Time.

Best of luck with this tough situation. 




  alcoholism is a disease of the spirit.

This is so true.  Well said, my friend. 














 How dare you tell us what's moral or not moral!  Who do you think you are?!! 














 Two things: 

1. I posted this in /r/law and /r/badlawyer yesterday; 

2. /r/politics deletes many of my links for myriad stupid reasons including my link to an article this morning where Scott Walker was called a liar by the British Prime Minister over false claims Walker made about President Obama.  "Off-topic."  A link to the endorsement of Rick Perry by the American Sniper widow was deleted as off-topic.  It's gotten to a point where most mods no longer bother to respond to my objections or inquiries.  The deletions are indefensible under their own rules. 




 In the US, our Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 better known as HIPAA is similarly implicated, but the right to recover for a breach of confidentiality would not survive the decedent.  It's interesting, I'm dealing with a family of a gentleman who died of lung cancer and the Cleveland Clinic is making access to the decedent's medical records nearly impossible even for the surviving widow, again because of HIPAA.   




 I honestly believe that those of us who KNOW for ourselves that we are alcoholic and that we should get help--have already taken the first 3 steps the day we walk through the doors of our first AA meeting.  I think that it's useful, though, to get a sponsor and "work through" every step with the sponsor even 1-3 at a pace most comfortable for you and the sponsor.  The "clean up steps" 4-9 are best addressed systematically over the course of the first and possibly second years.  I posted earlier in the week about a difficult financial amends with the IRS that I'm working on and I'm just a couple of months shy of 6 years if that gives you any idea of how these can take time.  Finally, all this work is about creating a blueprint for living your authentic life and helping others.  So 10, 11, and 12 are all about that aspect of your new life. 









 The issue with human remains is fairly settled in most states (and to be clear, state not federal law governs this question).  The human corpse and its attendant organs are supposed to be the PROPERTY of the decedent's estate and thus belong to the executor or next of kin.  But the disposition of the body otherwise--i.e. the pathology, tissue donation, or errors in switching corpses have not successfully given rise to lawsuits.  

Frankly, I'm the OP of this link and an attorney and I mostly find the story interesting from the standpoint that nearly every aspect of "personhood" creates rights and remedies and this slightly ghoulish example was a colorful but not terribly important situation except to illustrate that outrage does not mean actionable lawsuit. 




  I an so sick of the GOP claiming they are the ones who represent Vets 

As a US Army veteran of the Viet Nam era, I totally agree. 




 A couple of years ago I got into this discussion using the lifeboat metaphor.  For me, if I were drowning and I was thrown a lifeline about to be pulled aboard a lifeboat I KNOW I wouldn't question the belief system of my rescuers, but that's what we alcoholics seem to do  reflexively.  Of course, AA language has ingrained references to God and prayer--but the real solution in AA is built on 4 simple ideas:

1. Give the alcoholic a substitute for the dependence on booze;

2. Remind the alcoholic RITUALLY that even one drink will lead to pain and relapse;

3. Repair the social and medical damage that was done;

4. Restore self-esteem.

That is the point and the purpose of the 12 Steps.  AA is the simplest and most accessible model for achieving these 4 simple ideas IN MY EXPERIENCE.  BTW, I believe SMART Recovery and Rational Recovery are designed to do the same 4 things.  





























 Get a shop vac! 




 I was at my home group Thursday night and after listening to the prayers and mentions of God, I made sure I said--if your new here (we always have new people at this meeting) you do not need to believe in God, or a higher power, or prayer.  You are welcome here.  No one will look down on you over your belief or non-belief.  

I hope that you will remember to do likewise when you feel strong enough and included-enough in your meetings to make sure the newcomers hear that message--the message of inclusion.  The only requirement for membership in AA is a desire to stop drinking and I'm personally glad you are giving it a shot.  Now having said all that -- I needed to get over myself and the notion that my objections to religious belief were an obstacle to my getting sober when in reality MY ego was my biggest obstacle.

Good luck. 




 Nice!  sniff  Nice! 




 Yes!  Social anxiety is a fairly normal part of early recovery.  Can you think of any reasons why apart from your individual psychological make up?  It's actually pretty simple if you think about it.  When we do drugs and alcohol we are intentionally cutting ourselves off from engagement with others.  Often we isolate in order to do whatever our drug or drugs of choice are--undisturbed by family, friends or acquaintances.  Now that we're sober we do the whole social thing without the aid of chemicals--it's like learning how to ride a bicycle in public without training wheels.  But guess what?  Training wheels are available at the closest AA meeting.  It's how I successfully reintegrated.  Don't be afraid to speak up--we want you to open your mouth and tell us your experience!  Someone in the room may need to hear what you have to say. 




 Welcome /u/Germain_Goldchain to r/stopdrinking.  You may already have come across [this link to the Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which is what I did to stop drinking and to get sober.  These are the simple next steps to start stopping for many of us.  Good luck to you. 




 Welcome /u/wannabechefjojo to r/stopdrinking--so [at this link is the post known on the sub as the Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which lays out simple "next actions" we can take to stop drinking and to get sober.  I did these things and the Baby Steps are a daily part of my life.  Best of luck to you. 




 I did AA.  I met a bunch of lunatics that I began hanging with.  We did  golf, softball, bowling, meals, dating, and everything I thought I was doing when I drank.   




 Heck, /u/fear2111 -- I thought you were going to ask a hard one!  So at this [link is a post called the Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which describes in detail how I stopped drinking and how I got sober.  Now let me be specific about getting away from beer.  When I make my conscious daily decision not to drink TODAY no matter what happens good or bad, alcohol is out of my movie for the day, all day. This includes beer.  But let's go one baby step further--I need new friends, new situations and new activities BECAUSE I need to extinguish the old reinforcers--my beered-up buddies, bar rooms, and drinking activities.  For me this mean recovery, and AA was the easiest, most accessible route to recovery.  In doing this I needed to get rid of my preconceptions about what this might involve and dive in.  I did and it worked for me.

 I created a stand alone post with the Agnostic 12 Steps.   




 The Agnostic 12 Steps:

1. We admitted we were powerless over alcoholthat our lives had become unmanageable.

2. Came to believe and to accept that we needed strengths beyond our awareness and resources to restore us to sanity.

3. Made a decision to entrust our will and our lives to the care of the collective wisdom and resources of those who have searched before us.

4. Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.

5. Admitted to ourselves without reservation, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.

6. Were ready to accept help in letting go of all our defects of character.

7. With humility and openness sought to eliminate our shortcomings.

8. Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them all.

9. Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others.

10. Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong, promptly admitted it.

11. Sought through meditation to improve our spiritual awareness and our understanding of the AA way of life and to discover the power to carry out that way of life.

12. Having had a spiritual awakening as a result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics, and to practice these principles in all our affairs. 




 Stunning post, Sam.  You do have way more than booze and drunken conversation--you have a blueprint, a road map for a whole new way of life.   




 90 degrees yesterday!  Raining cats and dogs this morning and cool.   









 Or "W." 









 Here's one of the coolest things about sobriety--you get to discover what is your new normal.  

You're very smart to seek as much support at this stage of the journey because **in early sobriety we need to extinguish the old reinforcers of drinking friends, drinking venues, and drinking activities.**  That is why successful recovery is almost always a journey of fellowship.   





























 Welcome /u/MuiLaV to /r/stopdrinking -- I found it useful not to think of myself "quitting drinking" which implies permanently changing my habits.  Instead I stop drinking TODAY, only, and I can renew this commitment, daily if I choose.  But, let me give you MY broader blueprint: [it is at a separate post called the Baby Steps.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  The Baby Steps are what I did to stop drinking and to get SOBER. Good luck. 




 I will not drink TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; I'm doing rainy Saturday in Cleveland SOBER, all day. 




 This is very insightful for someone at 6 days!  Good for you.  

I think it's a pretty common experience in recovery that at some early point--if we are sincere--we find that we have become new people.  We start to live with a new purpose to become who we thought we might be. We become interested in passions and interests that we dreamed we do someday if we could ever get off the bar stool or out of the club.  

It's all out there, keep doing what you're doing. 




 Weekends were never my problem, drinking was.  If I make a daily decision that I am not going to drink TODAY no matter what happens good or bad--alcohol is out of my movie for the day, no matter what day it is.  The fellowship of other sober pals is my reinforcement. My commitment to myself and to my sober friends is all that I need. Good luck. 




 Congratulations, /u/royalobi!  So, this whole getting SOBER thing is working out for you?
