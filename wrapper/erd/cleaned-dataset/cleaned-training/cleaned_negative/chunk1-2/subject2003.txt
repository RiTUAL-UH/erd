 Scientifically, technologically, politically? Why did we suddenly decide to spend a couple billion dollars to send a craft to the rough edges of space, when we haven't seen deemed it feasible to do it again for the past 30-40 years? 



















  Ok I promised /u/Piospro a value investing post, so here's one. The entire post is 14 pages worth of Word, so given the 10,000 charcter limit I'll only be posting the first few pages here. You can read the rest on my blog: http://investingmy.com/sapurakencana-5218-kl/

 Anyway, just to tl;dr, this is a company I feel pretty good about. Feel free to share your opinions.



**BACKGROUND**  
SapuraKencana. What is it?
It used to be solely in the oil and gas services industry, laying pipes for upstream suppliers. The company started out as Sapura Bhd, which was specifically involved in OCSS (Offshore Construction and Subsea Services), before merging with Kencana Bhd in 2012 which was primarily a FHUC (fabrication, hook-up and commissioning) provider.
Basically, the oil and gas industry is broken into 3 different industries  upstream suppliers who do the actual drilling and procurement of oil, midstream suppliers laying the pipelines or providing the equipment for the upstream suppliers (i.e. transportation of oil), and downstream suppliers who do the processing and refining to turn the crude oil into something actually usable, such as petrol or kerosene. Then there are the integrated oil majors, sometimes known as integrated oil or super majors, such as ExxonMobil, BP or Shell, which do all three.
Sapurakencana in this context used to be a midstream supplier, laying the pipeline and transporting oil for the large oil and gas majors in places where they dont deem it feasible to do it themselves. It also supplies oil rigs to these companies so that they are able to drill the oil in the first place. 
However, with the recent acquisition of Newfield Malaysia in 2013, SapuraKencana has effectively dipped into the upstream market by participating in the actual drilling for oil. It is clear with the recent acquisitions that its CEO, Tan Sri Shahril Shamsuddin (Shahril) is trying to transform SapuraKencana into an integrated oil major. In the same year, SapuraKencana acquired the entire tender rig division of Seadrill Ltd, a major midstream player in the US market, in exchange for some cash and a 12% stake in SapuraKencana (which has since been pared down to 8%). This effectively made it the largest tender rig operator in the world. 



**RUNNING THE NUMBERS**  
**Net profit**  
Net profit has shown pretty decent y-o-y growth, rising 60% last year and projected to match last years performance this year. 3Q/2015 results have already surpassed the previous years full year results by 16%. Revenues also increased proportionally, likely coming from the acquisitions. 
Depreciation for the nine months to 3Q/2015 was RM 829,919, while finance costs were RM 513,459. Im going to assume that CAPEX for the next 3 years or so is going to average about RM 1Bn, based on the depreciation figure. Finance costs on the other hand are a bit troubling. As well see later, debt has been rising even after the acquisition.

**Capital structure**  
The company has approximately 6 billion shares outstanding, giving it a market capitalization of around RM 17bn at the current share price of RM 2.80. In comparison, it has a whopping RM 14bn in debt which incurred interest of RM 500m in the nine months leading up to 3Q/2015. Debt:equity is 1.2x; which does not factor in payables, which if included brings the liabilities:equity ratio to 1.8x (high payables is common in oil   gas companies). At this point, the company is levered to the hilt. The fact that it was able to reach this point is impressive in itself, much less any consideration that it might be able to further increase its leverage. Im sure its strong brand in the region had been a key factor in helping it acquire this magnitude of financing in the first place. 
The first question which springs to anyones mind is whether the company can continue to service its interest and principal obligations, in the context of the falling oil price environment. Its unlikely we will ever see $100/barrel oil again, although consensus is that oil will revert back to about $60-$70 in two to three years time. So the question is, can SapuraKencana survive over the next two to three years?

The answer is a resounding, if not quite reassuring, yes. The company has a RM 30 bn orderbook, which at current revenue levels is enough to maintain performance for the next three years, albeit at zero (or possibly negative) growth. Obviously, things are not as straightforward as that, however if the company can continue populating its orderbook at even slightly slower rates, it should be fine. Alliance Bank states that the company would have to maintain its orderbook to sustain its contract burn rates. Even in the worst case scenario, the company is well-recognised and well-connected enough that refinancing debt (albeit at higher interest rates) is always an option.
Having said that, the bigger question and the elephant in the room, is whether the company can redeem its debt in full in a reasonable amount of time. Any debt which remains on the balance sheet will incur interest charges, which represent a fixed share of profits going to debtholders. For reasons yet unapparent until the 2015 financial statements come out, it seems that debt has increased by RM 3bn in the nine months to 3Q/2015 despite no significant acquisitions taking place, not including an additional RM8bn Islamic note signed in Jan 2015 which was not captured in the 3Q/2015 statements. No equity investor in his right mind would buy shares at the current price (9 Feb 2015: RM 2.80) without a serious plan in place to reduce the debt burden. The CEO has said he expects to debt reduce to US$ 3bn in 3 years; however, how he plans to do that while maintaining present growth rates is anyones guess. Debt:equity levels have to reduce within the next 10 years AT MOST  without artificially diluting equity holder  if equity investors which to see a profitable ROI on their investments today. 

In any case, here are some finer details about the debt. Interest payments are currently at about 4% of debt  some sources claim that it is 1-2%, although Im not sure how theyre getting to that. The 4% figure is impressive anyhow, given that corporate debt on the largest companies in the US is going for about 5% average. This is no doubt contributed by two factors: firstly, its brand and connections to the Malaysian government (a bailout in the event of a catastrophe is highly likely), and the fact that it has access to international barrel-scrapping interest rates. A few minor points to note are that: i) the debt is denominated in USD, ii) the company doesnt really participate in any currency hedging, and iii) the recent spike in MYR-USD rates have been beneficial for the company since it reports earnings in MYR.
Another related possible cause for concern is that RM 9bn (possibly increased since Jan 2014) of debt is maturing and payable in 2 years. Thats right folks; it has to front RM 1.50/share of debt within 2 years, something which is only possible via refinancing. While this is no cause for alarm due to the high likelihood of refinancing, remarkably little details have been provided regarding what this debt relates to and why the maturity date is so short for such a staggering amount of debt, as well as why it was structured so unusually to begin with. Is it a bridging loan for the eventual sukuk-tization of the debt? Was it a sale and leaseback agreement for the Seadrill assets? Nobody really knows. Its something to stay incredibly conscious about, thats for sure. 
In any case, heres the bottom line. As weve explored above, the company is in growth mode and is expected to continue its impressive rate of growth through further acquisitions, given its vision of becoming a fully integrated oil major. Since oil and gas companies do not typically have a lot of free cash flow (FCF) after reinvestment, it can only do so in one of two ways: take on more debt or issue equity and dilute shareholders. So far, management has been extremely prescient about the effects of diluting shareholders, and theoretically picking up debt is an optimal way of maximizing returns. However, it is approaching dangerously close to the possibility of default risk in the event of a global economic catastrophe. For instance, if a hypothetical world war were to suddenly break out, the company would definitely fold. 

I wont go into a full breakdown of each segments performance, as my goal with this article is to give you a broad overview of the company with enough detail to fill in the blanks yourself, but not to unnecessarily overwhelm you with numbers. If you need a more detailed breakdown in one or two areas, I hope you can do a simple Google search which can bring you directly to the source, as opposed to me throwing the entire kitchen sink at you (which will make this article about 3x longer). I found a good site which aggregated the majority of its past three quarters performance here: http://m.kinibiz.com/tag/shahrilshamsuddin
In any case, it seems that the companys cost management has been ebbing up and down over time. Its not a cause for concern but it indicates that successfully battling the two fronts of stellar revenue growth coupled with excellent cost management is not an expectation you should hold dearly should you decide to become an investor. 

**Other**  
Besides that, none of the numbers represent anything out of the ordinary. You can scan them yourselves in the balance sheet, profit   loss and cash flow figures in the tables above; the material items from each statement are listed below their respective tables. 



**ANALYSIS**  
Ok, so heres the lowdown on the company. As you all should already know, the company has been going on a massive shopping spree over the past few years. Starting in 2012, it merged with Kencana Bhd to form SapuraKencana as we know it today....

This is not going to happen. Musk has no idea what he's getting into.

I worked on the original Iridium satellite phone project. I built a simulator for the entire network, and the handset uplink bandwidth was 2400 baud. Yep. Just 2400 bits per second.

Now we can do things like improve coding efficiency and maybe add a little bit more power to the satellites (although Iridium satellites are huge already) or perhaps bring them a little closer to earth, and at the very best case we might get 10x improvement. So now we're up to 100kbps.

That's not even 2G speeds. And who's going to want that, especially now that 3rd world countries have already solved the internet-access problem with 4G-LTE cell towers?

If you want faster speeds, you'll need expensive tracking dishes or phased-array antennas, and at this point your market size dramatically decreased. Pretty soon your market is going to only be 10,000 or so airplanes and ships. That's it. (lol @ the idea that there's going to be 200 million customers.. try 20,000 instead.)

After all that, you'll still never get close to fiber-optic speeds, which are hitting 10GBps now for the corporate world, literally a MILLION times faster, and doesn't have the power-cost problem that wireless does.

Sorry Elon Musk, but this is a dead-end project. Many smart people have already tried to solve this and failed, and you're not adding anything new.

 A client recently tasked us with creating a relatively simple asset allocation model for optimal geographical diversification. We're a relatively small shop, so we usually don't create models - we just work out the details in our heads and make the decision. Since it's a low priority concern, the job was delegated and re-delegated until it's reached me. So... here I am, seeking advice on reddit.

I've been doing my own research for awhile before it crossed my mind that some of you here may have done it before. Basically, what I've done so far is just a basic risk parity model and constructed an efficient frontier, which might satisfy someone who hasn't seen one before (i.e. the client) but probably not my bosses. I don't think he's looking for a full blown statistical thesis on the relationship between Brazillian oil wells and Chinese political dynasties, but if anyone could share their experience it would be greatly appreciated. For context, we're looking at 4 regions - USA, Asia Pacific, China   ASEAN. 

Thanks!

P.S. I've seen some of the geographical diversification studies while Googling around -  it doesn't need to be that complicated. We're just looking for something respectable which can still be explained to the laymen.

 To clarify, I'm not referring to the exclusion of the Apocrypha resulting from the Catholic-Protestant split following the Reformation of Martin Luther. I'm referring instead to the consensus arrived at during the Councils of Carthage, Nicea and Trent, between 300-400 AD. 

Are there any reliable sources detailing the discussion and rationale that was held in arriving at the canonical books? Such as why the book of Enoch was not included, and why the books of Paul make up the majority of the New Testament?

 I'd like to buy a pack of sweeteners in bulk, but the popular brands like Equal are daylight robbery. Anyone have any experience with generic branded ones? Preferably mail-order able?

 It blows my mind that in this enlightened day and age of the smartphone, there still isn't a *free* app on the App Store that very simply takes your inputs for income and expenses and arranges it neatly into a 400-year old accounting standard. All the current offerings on the App Store are either simple expense trackers (i.e. budget apps), or rape you from behind in the backwater woods of Kansas with $35/year subscription fees. 

Can we get something going here? It really doesn't have to be anything inordinately complicated. We just need what basically amounts to a calculator that performs spontaneous double entry overlaid with a material design wrapper. Heck, we could probably just rip off an existing app, beautify it and get it done for less than $1000 all-in, or even hire a fellow Redditor to do it. We could even name it after /r/Accounting and start challenging Intuit   Quickbooks in the small business sector. Anyone else in, or any developers interested?

Update: so it seems in not alone in my frustration! A fellow Big 4 got in touch with me about getting something going once the busy season subsides in April. If you'd be willing to support a project like this, please indicate below! Maybe a mod or someone objective could volunteer to host the Kickstarter?

 **The Financially Distressed and Bankrupt Security
Investing Process**

Investors in financially distressed and bankrupt securities must
concentrate on the corporate balance sheet. Like knowing the
opposing lineups at a baseball game, understanding the
amounts and priorities of a company's liabilities can tell
investors a great deal not only about how the various security
holders are likely to be treated but also how the financial distress
is likely to be resolved.

The first step is to value the assets of the debtor. Once the size
of the pie is known, it is possible to consider how it may be
divided. To facilitate this process, an investor must divide the
debtor's assets into two parts: the assets of the ongoing business;
and the assets available for distribution to creditors upon
reorganization, such as excess cash, assets held for sale, and
investment securities. Investors in AM International, Inc., senior
claims received substantial amounts of AM's excess cash upon
reorganization; investors in Braniff Airlines' first bankruptcy in
1983 received liquidating trust certificates backed by a direct
interest in aircraft assets.

In valuing an ongoing business operating in Chapter 11,
investors should employ each of the valuation methodologies
described in chapter 8. In many instances the investor is in the
difficult position of analyzing a moving target since the business
of the debtor is unstable, if not in turmoil. It is essential
that investors take into account any income statement and cash
flow distortions caused by the Chapter 11 process itself. Interest 
earned on excess cash that builds up during bankruptcy, for
example, will not be a source of income for the reorganized
company. Similarly, interest expense on reinstated debt, which
does not accrue during bankruptcy, will once again accrue.
Then, again, the high investment banking, legal, and administrative
costs of a Chapter 11 proceeding, often cumulatively
totaling several percent or more of the value of the debtor's
estate, will cease upon emergence from bankruptcy. Bankrupt
companies may even intentionally "uglify" their financial statements
(for example, by expensing rather than capitalizing certain
expenses or by building excessive balance sheet reserves) in
order to minimize the assets apparently available for distribution
to creditors. This value is ultimately revealed after reorganization,
but by then insiders have picked up cheap stock or
options.

Analysis of the assets and liabilities of financially distressed
or bankrupt companies must extend beyond the balance
sheet however. Off-balance-sheet assets may include real
estate carried below current value, an overfunded pension
plan, patents owned, and the like. Off-balance-sheet liabilities
may include underfunded pension plans, Internal Revenue
Service, Environmental Protection Agency, Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), and other governmental
claims, and claims resulting from rejected executory contracts
and leases. In recent steel industry bankruptcies, for example,
Wheeling Pittsburgh Steel and LTV Corporation transferred
their underfunded pension plans to the PBGC, resulting in a
bankruptcy claim by the PBGC against Wheeling and protracted
litigation between the PBGC and LTV.

Once a debtor's assets have been valued, investors should
turn their attention to the liability side of the balance sheet. The
liabilities of a bankrupt company are best evaluated in descending
order of seniority. Secured debt should be evaluated first. If
the value of the security interest is determined, whether
through negotiation or a valuation proceeding, to be equal to or
greater than the amount of claim, the claim is said to be fully
secured or oversecured. An oversecured claim entitles the
holder to postpetition accrued interest (interest that would have
accrued during the bankruptcy proceeding) to the extent of the
amount of oversecurity. If secured debt is determined to be less
than fully secured, holders will typically receive value equal to
the extent of their security plus a senior but unsecured claim
against the debtor for the amount of the undersecurity.

There may be some investment opportunities in distressed
securities at every rank in the debt hierarchy. Risk-averse
investors will generally prefer to hold senior securities; the
potential return from senior securities is frequently less than
that available from junior claims, but the risk is also much
lower. Senior securities are first in priority, and unless they are
fully or almost fully repaid, junior classes are unlikely to receive
significant value.

"Fulcrum securities"-the class of securities partly but not
fully covered by asset value-s-can also be attractive investments
at the right price, ranking midway on the risk spectrum. Fulcrum
securities benefit most directly from value increases and likewise
are most directly impaired by any value diminution.
Investing in junior securities can provide spectacular returns
but can also prove disastrous. These securities often serve as
out-of-the-money options-effectively, bets-on an improvement
in operating results or an increase in value.

The common stock of bankrupt companies frequently trades
considerably above its reorganization value, which is often
close to zero. While there may be an occasional horne run, as a
rule investors should avoid the common stock of bankrupt entities
at virtually any price; the risks are great and the returns
very uncertain. Unsophisticated investors have lost a great deal
of money buying the overpriced common stock of bankrupt
companies, even after the unfavorable terms of the reorganization
plan have been widely disseminated.

It is worth remembering that restructurings and bankruptcy
reorganizations are negotiated processes. Negotiations can be
affected by the relative bargaining strengths and weaknesses of 
the different classes of creditors, the skills of the negotiators,
and the dollar amounts at stake.

By way of example, Ron Labow headed an investor group
that bought up most of Wheeling Pittsburgh Steel's bank debt
and dictated a reorganization plan that left him in control of the
reorganized company. A blocking position-one-third of the
outstanding amount of debt-in a small, closely held debt issue
may enable that class to obtain better treatment than similar but
more widely held debt issues. The holder of a blocking position
in even the most junior bankrupt security, because of his or her
ability to delay the debtor's emergence from bankruptcy, may
gain far better treatment for his or her class than allowed by any
allocation made strictly according to priority ranking. A blocking
position is said to have "hold-up" value in two senses: the
owner can hold up (delay) the bankruptcy process as well as
hold up (rob) other classes of creditors, extracting nuisance
value from what might otherwise be a nearly worthless claim.

 **Beta**  

In this article, were going to explore one of the fundamental cornerstones of investing  Risk. What is risk, you may ask? Well, if the finance industry was a person and you were to ask him that question, the answer youd likely get is beta. 

But what is beta? Beta is derived from the second letter of the Greek alphabet, and it is meant to represent the volatility of a security in comparison to a benchmark. Lets say youre planning to evaluate the risk of investing in a companys stock. A suitable benchmark might be the main index of the country in which the company is incorporated  for instance, the S P 500 index or the Dow Jones index for a US company. By comparing the volatility of a securitys trading price to that of its brethren index  which is to say how much its share price moves for every $ the index moves  you get a number, e.g. 2. This means that when the index price moves $1, the share price of the company moves $2 in the same direction as the index. Of course, things arent always as simple as that, since the stock prices of both fluctuate up and down every second; so you really have to use a computer if you want to accurately pinpoint the beta down to a decimal range. 

So why is beta considered a measure of risk? Well, the logic is that if a companys stock moves $2 whenever the index moves $1, it is more risky than the index since you stand to lose double what the index would lose, all else being equal. Since the mantra in the investment world is risk vs reward, that line of reasoning fits well into the established standard. After all, if a stock might go up twice as fast but also might go down twice as fast, doesnt that mean it has higher risk?

However, if you pay attention, you might find that some people who call themselves value investors are shunning the concept of volatility or beta as an ideal measure of risk. You may have heard of the most famous one of them before  Warren Buffett. Yes, the third richest guy in the world. Summarily, Warren says that it is absurd that the risk of an investment should be represented by the volatility of a stock, i.e. how much its share price moves compared to its benchmark. He cites an example  for instance, lets say the share price of a really safe blue-chip stock like American Express drops 50% overnight due to temporary problems (this really happened, and was known as the Salad Oil Scandal). How would investing half your money into 100 American Express shares be more risky than investing all your money for the same 100 shares? Logically, it should only be half as risky, since only half your money is at risk (as opposed to all your money previously). But since beta ignores the underlying conditions of the company and only focuses on the movement of the share price, the subsequent dive would probably reflect a double-digit beta. If one were to studiously follow beta as a measure of risk, he would proceed to view the stock as incredibly risky and perhaps sell it immediately. Whereas what Warren Buffett saw instead was a company trading at a much reduced price, like a discount sale, and he proceeded to buy up as many shares as he reasonably could. The rest is history  he ended up making a lot of money when the share price recovered to earlier levels.

Hence, investors who focus on fundamental analysis of a company might come to the same conclusion that beta is not an ideal measure of risk; since in the above example, the shares were actually least risky when the beta was at its highest. Of course, in most cases volatility actually reflects risk rather well, as when a share price drops there usually is a good underlying reason for that drop. However, in enough cases to be relevant, it causes investors to miss out on potentially good deals, and because of that many people have joined the bandwagon in calling for the end of betas reign as a proper measure of risk.

However, there has to be a reason why beta became the defining measure of risk in the first place. Have you ever asked yourself why beta is considered risk? We all pay lip service to the fact that beta is volatility, and that high volatility equals high risk. But if I were to ask you to explain why beta is risk, would you be able to tell me? What does it mean when we say volatility equals risk? Why do professionals around the world trust hundreds of billions of dollars with it? Why do some denounce it, and who is it useful to (or not)?

 
**What Is Beta?**
  
  
Well, to understand how we came up with the concept of volatility as risk, one has to take a trip down memory lane and go back to high school. Remember all those charts you learnt in eighth grade statistics? The bell curve, those squiggly lines connecting all the randomly placed dots, the mean and the variance? Well, lets refresh your memory. 

[Chart of a stock](http://i.imgur.com/1Dzg8Ct.png)

See, if you look at the chart of any stock, youll notice that its actually a plot of data points seemingly randomly strewn across the chart, with the x-axis representing Price and the y-axis representing Time. Now lets apply some high-school statistics to it. Lets say you wanted to get a mean (average) representation of all the points, so that you can make some sense out of all the random data. How do you do this? You take a ruler, and draw a line at the mid-point between all the data points. Remember, high school? 
 
So now you have a line which represents the average price of the stock at any point in time. But remember, this line is just an average, so trying to use it to represent the actual data may not be so accurate. If all the data points are close to the line, then we call this a close fit  and the line can be said to be a true approximation of all the data points. However, if one particular data point strays far away from the line, then we cant say that the line accurately represents the stock price at that point in time, as the stock price was never near the average price predicted by the line. This is where the concept of volatility comes in.

See, with hundreds of thousands of stocks to look at every day, thats billions of price points for the banks to glean through and try to make some sense of. Hence, simply out of necessity, the banks simplify all the stock prices by averaging them, lest they become overwhelmed by all the information. For each company, they come up with an average line to represent the stock price of the day, month or year.  They then use that line for other things, such as predicting the future stock price by extrapolating it, running a sensitivity analysis  or just putting it into a fancy Powerpoint chart to impress their clients. As a result, they end up relying on these lines (i.e. averages) for many of their crucial functions.

So now weve established that banks have to work on the law of averages, since its impossible to turn a profit crunching a billion data points every single day. However, as weve observed above, sometimes averages are not representative of their true conditions, since a particular price point may stray far away from the average which the line represents. Hence, banks have to come up with a way to account for this imperfection when relying on averages. This is where volatility comes into the picture. 

**What Is Volatility?**

Volatility, in laymans terms, is simply how far the price points on a stock chart stray from the average that the line represents  such that it renders the average inefficient as a representative of actual conditions. For instance, lets say that you plot an average line from a chart of price points of a stock throughout the day. However, assume none of the data points actually sit close to the line; hence, the line only exists as an average of the points, and it sits smack in the middle of all of them. But as each point sits far away from each other, the fact that the average line sits in the middle of all of them doesnt actually mean that the average line accurately represents them. In fact, if you were to solely rely on the line as a fact and try to extrapolate the future price of the stock, you would probably get a very different result from reality. This is because that average line is a poor indicator of what past prices really were; it merely acts a mid-point of all the past prices. In this case, if we were to use the average line as a beginning frame of reference (remember, bank employees rely on the averages out of necessity), we say that the actual prices reflect high volatility from the average. Its just another way of saying that the average is imperfect, and we should be careful when using it. 

So now you know that since its not realistic for banks to individually crunch all prices of every stock at every second (i.e. data points), they instead draw a line through all the prices of a stock throughout the day (or week, month, etc.) and use that average to reflect the entire days price. Then, if a line does not accurately reflect all the price points it is derived from, we say that the line has a high degree of volatility  or imperfection. Likewise, if all the price points sit close to the average that the line represents, we can say that the line is a good representation of the actual data and has a low degree of volatility  or is close to perfect. Thus, using an average price (i.e. line) with higher volatility has more risk, whereas using an average price with less volatility has less risk! 

Hence, this is why we say that volatility (i.e. beta) is risk! 

**But Wait What About The Other Guys?**

So now weve established that volatility is actually a pretty good approximation for risk, by virtue of the fact that we have to rely on average data as opposed to actual data to get our jobs done. And if you pour over the explanation again, beta is actually a pretty good measure of risk. So why do these value investors have a problem with it?

Well, as weve seen, beta is derived from the past performance of stock price. That means that it completely ignores the underlying company which the stock is traded on, and merely observes the price at which it trades at. For instance, lets take the passing of Steve Jobs as an example. When he died, the stock of Apple took a big hit, because people were wondering whether the charismatic nature of the companys leader could be replaced. However, a proper analyst would observe that it takes more than one person to run a hundred billion dollar company  it takes a vertically integrated supply chain, an amazing product, a visible brand, a tip-top management team, as well as tens of thousands of employees to run Apple. So while the departure of the CEO can be viewed as a negative, it is only a blip in the grand scheme of things; at least, as far as the future development of Apple is concerned. However, the emotional side of the market tends to react by driving the stock price because other people are selling, not because of anything that has to do with the fundamental position of the company. In such a case, beta would provide a poor measure of risk  as although volatility shoots through the roof when the stock dives, the company itself is almost completely identical to how it was the day before, just minus one CEO. Most people would say that it would not be any more risky to invest in Apple than it was the day before. In fact, by nature of the stock being cheaper, it would actually be less risky, since you stand to lose less money if you were to buy the same number of stocks. 

Hence, an isolated top-down measurement of risk using only historical price as a benchmark can in many ways be ineffective, if not downright misleading. Some people might say that this is not an issue because the market is an efficient barometer which reflects all available information perfectly (i.e. Efficient Market Hypothesis); however, many of us would agree that the market is not always efficient, and imperfections can and do appear in the market  as weve demonstrated in the above example. As a result, beta as a measure of risk should be taken with a grain of salt. 

**So What Can We Use Beta For?**

This is not to say that beta is completely useless. Like a screwdriver, beta is just a tool  you just have to use it in the manner it was designed for. If you were to apply a screwdriver to a nail, you probably wouldnt make much progress since that wasnt what it was designed for. Likewise, if you were to use beta to measure the fundamental conditions of a company, you may not always get the most accurate results.

However, beta is extremely useful in one case scenario  if you want to be prepared for any eventuality. For instance, lets say you intend to pour all your retirement savings into a stock, and you dont know exactly when you should get out. Hence, you want to be prepared to sell in any eventuality. In such a case, beta can be an excellent measure of risk  since a lower volatility means that you have a lower chance of losing everything, whereas a higher beta means that you have a higher chance of losing likewise. In such a situation, you want to ensure that you dont lose too much no matter what happens  so it would make a lot of sense to pick a stock with a lower beta so that the potential for it to fall drastically is lower. This is one case where observing the historical price movement of a stock in order to define risk can make a lot of sense. However, if we were to apply beta to analysing the fundamental business conditions of a company, you might find yourself disappointed.

This is probably the most layman explanation of Beta on the Internet so I hope youve learned something today!

Also, as a side note, does anyone know how to add a bit extra white space between the end of my posts and comments? Currently there is just a single line break between the end of my posts and comments; I have to manually add 3-4 line breaks at the end of my posts as a result.

 FOR BETA OR WORSE (pg. 113)

Many market participants believe that investment risk is
intrinsic to specific securities, as it is to activities like hang
gliding and mountain climbing. Using modern financial theory, 
academics and many market professionals have attempted
to quantify this risk with a single statistical measure, beta.
Beta compares a security's or portfolio's historical price fluctuations
with those of the market as a whole. High-beta stocks
are defined as those that tend to rise by a higher percentage
than the average stock in a rising market and decline more
than the average stock in a falling market. Due to their greater
volatility, high-beta stocks are deemed to be riskier than lowbeta
stocks.
I find it preposterous that a single number reflecting past
price fluctuations could be thought to completely describe the
risk in a security. Beta views risk solely from the perspective of
market prices, failing to take into consideration specific business
fundamentals or economic developments. The price level
is also ignored, as if IBM selling at 50 dollars per share would
not be a lower-risk investment than the same IBM at 100 dollars
per share. Beta fails to allow for the influence that investors
themselves can exert on the riskiness of their holdings through
such efforts as proxy contests, shareholder resolutions, communications
with management, or the ultimate purchase of sufficient
stock to gain corporate control and with it direct access to
underlying value. Beta also assumes that the upside potential
and downside risk of any investment are essentially equal,
being simply a function of that investment's volatility compared
with that of the market as a whole. This too is inconsistent
with the world as we know it. The reality is that past
security price volatility does not reliably predict future investment
performance (or even future volatility) and therefore is a
poor measure of risk.

 I had put this out of my mind since the split, since after the pre-split pop to $700, I thought the stock had appreciated to fair value. However, recent comments about AAPL maybe getting into the electric car business prompted my interest again. Note that I wasnt interested primarily because of the car rumours; I just wanted to see whether the price it was trading at today still reckoned a second look at value. 

So, as you all might know, my minimum annual ROI for an investment is 15%. I could go into all the other details of AAPL - like how ROE has been steady above 30%, how the cash hoard has grown to nearly $180bn, how Apples debt is manageable, how share buybacks have contributed to 3% CAGR but I wont bother you with all that. Instead, Im just going to distill everything to one criteria  a 15% CAGR.

Since the shares have been trading at around $130 for the past month, lets use that as the entry price. Diluted EPS for the year has been $7.39, which gives AAPL an initial rate of return of 5.68%. Thats far below our required rate of return of 15%. 

However, net profit growth was 6.67% for the past year, which is pretty much what I expect things to remain at unless the company comes up with something new. Remember, were not counting on hope, only hard figures. According to my armchair economists observation, Apples net profit growth has plateaued unless it can come up with another revolutionary device  for the simple reason that there arent any more mass-affluent markets for the iPhone to conquer. After China, Africa and India remain the last two bastions of ginormous population sizes, however the folk there fall below the mass-affluent category and do not present a reliable market for the iPhone. And since over 70% of Apples profits come from the iPhone, its unlikely well see double digit growth if were not considering future revolutionary products.

However, lets not forget that the current profits are still throwing off massive cash flows, which Apple can beneficially employ in share buybacks and other shareholder wealth maximizing programmes. If Apples historical trends continue, we should be able to expect approximately 3% CAGR solely from share buybacks. I think this is a reasonable expectation, and is certainly in-line with other participants in maturing industries like Coca-Cola, IBM and McDonalds. In any case, well add the 3% to the aforementioned 6.67%, which yields us 9.67%.

For conveniences sake, lets round that up to 10%. While you might say that a 0.33% CAGR is not a negligible growth rate to round up, lets just consider that the probability-weighted growth derived from all other product categories, future product categories, as well as other financial engineering exercises. I think 0.33% is quite a safe growth estimate for all these miscellaneous items, especially if you consider further cost efficiency improvements (in which Tim Cook is king). So now we have a 10% yield into perpetuity.

Since this is a value investment, were going to assume that were holding this investment until we die. After all, what sense is there in holding shares of a blue-chip (esque) company if youre not going to hold it until you die? So since we all die at different ages, lets use 30 years as an appropriate timeframe. Im sure well all live for another 30 years, right? Right?

So if we assume an initial 5.68% return, and 10% growth over the next 30 years  plug that into a calculator and you get DING DING DING! A 16.55% CAGR! In case youre wondering, the calculation is: 

 30  (5.68 x 1.130) = 16.55%

Which is awesome. Keep in mind for that return, youre getting a stable quasi-blue chip company which is presently the largest company in the world by market cap. Now, lets examine the inherent risks in the assumptions used.

Some critics have pointed out that Apple relies on a single product, the iPhone, to generate almost all of its profits - and that in the realm of technology, where things can change in the blink of an eye, the incumbents position is generally not secured over the long term. However, I think thats just one side of the coin. IBM, Oracle, Sun, Microsoft, and Intel have all made pretty strong cases that large-cap technology incumbents can maintain their existence into perpetuity - even if it means yielding the top spot to a young upstart. Whats important is that: 1) they have loads and loads of cash to weather a market downturn  which Apple has, and 2) they have capable, shareholder-friendly management which adequately understands their risk:reward profile, which Apple does. If the tech incumbent has both, I think its safe to assume a 6.67% internally generated growth rate into perpetuity. 

The bonus at the end of all of this is that Apple may not yet be done with being THE BEST  NUMBER ONE! in its field. The iPad still has some game to catch up, but it presently still holds more than 40% market share... and that's still an open market for Apple to pursue. The Apple Watch is supposed to be a breakthrough device. well see about that. But theres good reason to be optimistic about an extra 1% growth from it. And the Apple Car wow, that would be fantastic if it would just do us a favour and exit the realm of rumours and fairy tales. In any case, these developments are just the proverbial icing on the cake. 

Anyway, the point is that Apples future is bright. Even without all these revolutionary changes, itll still yield our minimum rate of return, while providing the inherent security of investment of a large-cap. And that's good enough for me.
