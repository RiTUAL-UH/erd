 Thank you! :) nice to see some positive comments 




 Hey asshole, I only made an account because SO really likes reddit. I wish I could really just jump through the internet sometimes and punch people in the dick. 




 Geez, fuck off. Leave him alone. 

Spoiler alert: you're the cunt, and you never going to get any. 




 Hey, girlfriend here. Thanks to you guys who defended me. When I handed this to him, I flat out told him that it wasn't my design, so I didn't pass it off as mine. Second, I did what I did out of love. I had an extra canvas and I knew he liked that poster, so I wanted to paint it because what does just buying a poster really say about how you care for someone. I had one day to do it, between work, school, and driving an hour each way to see him, and it's hard for me to be creative under stress. Because of that I didn't really have time to do my own design but I wanted him to have something I painted. So for the record, I fucking love that kid, and all this is meant to be is a gift :) 
























 I've completed part of it, and next I'm going to add the moon from majora's mask, and maybe skull kid. :) 









 Wow dude, great job!! I frickin' love it!  




 Thanks! And I will most likely, these fuckers are just so butthurt.
