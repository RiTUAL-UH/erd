 Ok will do, thanks! 




 I would like to see Tristam and WRLD, i want to see what they are capable of producing together. 




 yeah, but it didnt get posted cause my account was to new at the time 









 It was posted on braken's soundcloud recently and the vocals sound like tristam so it is most likly a collab between the two. 









 Thanks man i didnt know that. 


































 thank you :) 




 As a fan of dubstep, i like this alot! 














 Nope its not photoshopped, its from the hubble telescope, its a very old picture though (from the 1990s i think)
