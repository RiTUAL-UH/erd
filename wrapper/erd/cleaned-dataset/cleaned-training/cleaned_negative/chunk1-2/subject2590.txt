 Q: What do you call a cheap circumcision? 
A: A rip off. 
Only ever get groans of disgust lol 




 Took me 8 reads to realize there was nothing wrong with it. You rotten redditers  




 I read that as "and it was the highlight of my life" 
I really need to read more carefully when I'm on reddit...  




 I recently hit that age where I'm doing it twice a week, aflush with cash, and confident in life and my assertions of right and wrong (lol let's see how long that lasts). Still living with my Parents (both of whom are undergoing serious midlife-crises). Life is good :)

Well good! I'd far prefer for abused people to grow up and become happy and productive members of society. Unfortunately for me, I'm stuck with my asshole of a cousin who, for some unfathomable reason, has decided she doesn't want to fit in with the demographic that you so eloquently pointed out exists. Imagine that.  




 But you're not *just* a cum bucket. You're a cum bucket filled with nerves who just said that it feels great.  




 *little boy walks in. Sees grown man laying on floor with pants around ankles urinating straight into the air. Little boy walks out* 




 Nearly every major pc game that has come out after 2014 is unplayable unless you have an $800+ computer. I mean, I can turn down the graphics and visual settings pretty dang far, but when you're playing with the same resolution as an ipod touch things are just a little bit ridiculous.  




 I know one abused girl. She is a huge asshole. She also happens to be my cousin and lives with me. 
I dunno where you got your info but from personal experience abused people are jerks. Everyone always says "you don't know what she went through" but I mean c'mon, it was for like a year when she was 6. That's no excuse to be an ass.  




 Wait but you just said sex feels great. If you believe that it feels great, why are you not doing it?  




 Yes they are

Laughed my ass off at this  




 Would you rather watch porn of your parents or with your parents?  




 Oh from chat roulette?  




 I'd have Miley Cyrus stop singing and start doing por- 
Wait a second...  




 Oh you poor thing  




 That's true. You've got that going for you. Reddit loves you 3 




 He's dead Jim  




 I had to read this 3 times before I accepted the fact that it was real  




 He says where you WOULD put your finger. Not just where it's physically possible to put it.  
























 I get it. Cuz that's his name. Clever.  




 My body heals itself on on its own

 Legion:Skin deep by Brandon Sanderson is a fantasy novel that explores this idea. It's about 100 pages long and is an entertaining yet interesting read  




 I literally cannot stop laughing at that edit lol I'm dying Oh God reddit is killing me  




 Post a really clever and funny comment  




 Yeah sorry buddy. That's just a tad weird  




 Sorry in advance buuuuuttttttt he sounds like a dick. (I'm a guy btw) You make it sound like you're trying and you want to be great for him, and he is just using you as a hole for sex. The fact that he "doesn't talk during sex" really shouldn't be an excuse for why he isn't helping you build your confidence. Now I realize that telling you this isn't going to help at all, it isn't really constructive. This is just feedback and my opinion on what I'm noticing from your post. I would suggest working out. Many people that I know who had similar problems with confidence found themselves growing more comfortable with their bodies and abilities as lovers when they exercise frequently. Honestly sex feels great. I have sex all the time and it doesn't really matter what she does, it always feels nice. If she does a little extra stuff that feels cool too, but almost no matter what you do he will enjoy it and like it a lot. Don't freak out about it :)

 WOOOOOOOOAAAAHHHHHH COOOOOOOLLLLL

 Fucking vaccinate your kids. Smallpox is coming back in some parts of the world because people are refusing to vaccinate their kids for religious reasons or because they think it's linked to autism. This is a disease that killed off nearly the entire population of Native Americans because they had no resistance to it. Know who else has no resistance to it? 21st century citizens of the united states. Get them vaccines peeps 




 I read that as 5,120,000 years ago... Was gonna say that making a joke about how old teachers were isn't [serious]

 My parents told me if I got good grades in high school and did well in college that I'd get a good job. Hah.
