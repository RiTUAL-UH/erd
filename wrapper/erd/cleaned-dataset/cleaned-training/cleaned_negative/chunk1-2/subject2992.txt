 [Theory regarding what was happening to the baby:](#g "It would be interesting if the White Walkers could only turn dead people into Wights, however could turn living people into full-on White Walkers.") 




 Since Braavos shows up in the "Secrets" trailer and Ser Davos wrote a letter to the Iron Bank last episode; I'm presuming that is where he and Stannis will be heading to in the next two/three episodes.

EDIT: Fuck. 




 The Night King was the 13th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. There were 12 White Walkers in the background in this scene, making the one that approached the baby; the 13th. This doesn't necessarily mean anything, however it could be symbolic.
