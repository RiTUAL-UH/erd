 My sisters 8th birthday. She invited over 20 people to come see a movie and have lunch. After a couple hours she started getting upset since no one had showed up. People had called to confirm the date but Mum and I told her we must have put the wrong dates on the invites and took her home. She never wanted birthday partys after that.
