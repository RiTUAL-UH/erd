 A metric fuck ton of nope.  




 Awesome story. Very creepy and I am definitely looking forward to the update. My only complaint is when you said 'my brother and I'. Every time I read it my eyeball twitched. I can't be the only one.

 Got any weed on ya?
You'd be a lot cewler if you did.  





























 What's the story? 




 This is great. This needs to be a movie.  




 These comments are all focused on the animals. I'm sure she cares about the dog and cat more than any of us. They'll be straight. Dat update doe??!!!? 




 So I read your story then I read the other dudes story. Now I keep seeing oranges. There were two punk ass oranges in the street that I saw while driving home. There was a mark ass orange out front of my house. I'm going to throw away the jive ass oranges we have in the kitchen then I'm going to my moms.  




 WHATS IN THE BOX?!!!?
