 Children of the Corn.

Actually pretty good, until everything got so super natural. 




 Moist. 




 Paths of Glory by Stanley Kubrick

Definitely one of his best films. 




 Their is no time in a black hole. 
























 It has always flabbergasted how people could be rude to waiters/waitresses...They have complete control over your food and you're first instinct is to be an asshole.

Good luck with that. 




 Heath Ledger.
It seemed like his career was really about to take off. 




 After 5 years of having braces I'm still waiting for someone to say "Nice teeth". 




 Great movie! 
The soundtrack really does it for me.
