 It's more likely he acted due to the influence of drugs, possibly prescription ones.  I've raised a bunch of gamers and none have turned into murderers or bad people in any way.  Interestingly, none were on prescription drugs.

 No one can tell you whether or not you'll bond with your child.  You either want to, or you don't, it's that simple.  You're making it out to be some grand thing that no one has ever gone through before and is some great compromise you're making.  Stop it.  It's a new human being you're bringing to life and it's made from you. It's the greatest gift there is to give and is the only lasting contribution you'll probably ever make.  It's an investment in your own future.  If you don't want to end up a lonely old man you'll consider what things you'll want and will make you happy throughout your life.  For most people, it's the happiness that love and family bring.  If that isn't for you, let your wife find it elsewhere. 




 Regarding your title, I like going outside, it's pretty nice out there.  As far as your text goes, stop whining and do something about it if you care that much.  Complaining on the internet is not a solution. 




 Not everyone wants to be burned up, including me. 




 I'm not pontificating, I'm a grandparent who's cared for too many foster kids because of dads who didn't want to be dads.  I've far more real experience than you do, I'd bet. It's been my experience that it can go either of two ways; either he bonds with the newborn within a few days, or he does not.  If he does not, the child suffers and so does the mother since she's constantly having to make up for his lack of participation or, sometimes, abusive behaviour.  I'm sure there are some marriages that survive, but at what cost to the innocent child?  If you don't want to be called  daddy or won't step up for your own offspring, don't make someone else pay for it.

 It could be anything.

 I Spit on Your Grave is a controversial 1978 rape and revenge film. The film received a limited release, with a wider release in 1980.

No, you aren't wrong, it isn't confirmed.  However, "the intrusions were detected in December while Attkisson was reporting almost exclusively on the governments response to the terrorist attacks on the U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya.  Attkisson has previously investigated the Justice Departments gun-tracking operation known as Fast and Furious.

 We have a right to know about any information collected on us, with or without our knowledge.  Maybe Snowden figured making this info available to us is what it was going to take to wake up America.  He was right, and I consider the release of this information, at great potential harm to himself, to be an act of honor on his part. 




 This flag is not a cross that represents any of those things.  Your ideas do not relate to my statement at all. You can ascribe anything you want to them, it doesn't change their representation or use.  Perhaps you need to stop judging things based on centuries old practices.

 Some groups use the Southern Cross as one of the symbols associated with their organizations, including groups such as the Ku Klux Klan.  According to Civil War historian and native Southerner Shelby Foote, the flag traditionally represented the South's resistance to Northern political dominance; it became racially charged during the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s, when fighting against desegregation suddenly became the focal point of that resistance.

 Yeah, some days are harder than others, but through sheer determination I trudge along.  I know this is a temporary thing and something will change eventually.  I look forward to that, but luckily I'm a stubborn one and won't let it get the best of me. 




 Feelings of failure or inadequacy keep us looking back.  Why did they leave me?  Why wasn't I good enough?  What did I do wrong?  Could I have fixed it?  When in reality, it was probably nothing specific we did.  We're different people as we grow and change and aren't always suited to each other during certain phases of our lives.  There's probably something in a past relationship you miss and look to remind yourself of.  Just because we aren't with them doesn't mean the feelings disappeared.  It's ok to look back every now and then, just remember you're not who you used to be and have grown since then.

 Never, ever get personally or intimately involved with a coworker.  Just count it as illegal in your life.
