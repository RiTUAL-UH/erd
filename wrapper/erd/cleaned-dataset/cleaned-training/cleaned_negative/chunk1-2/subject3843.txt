 Meeting girls parents, normally this wouldn't frighten me but she's graduating and i'm going to be spending apparently a significant amount of time with them alone. (college, not highschool)
Its an outdoor graduation, and its gonna be about 85 degrees F.  So i'll be wearing dark slim chinos and either a jcrew popover, or ocbd.
narrowed it down to these 4 pairs. http://i.imgur.com/bzUNAPj.jpg 

Normally wear boots for work, so the rogue wingtips wont bother me in the heat if you think they would work well.

personally was leaning toward the left pair, but not sure if they aren't casual enough for the occasion.  Never really dealt with this graduating stuff.

 A tank that says mastermind shouldn't be labeled as a "mastermind tank" unless its a tank top made by mastermind.
change that. unless your targeting the legal knock-off grey area market demographic. 




 chukkas or desert boots maybe.  Normally I dont care for toms, but i think matched with that shirt something interesting could be made. 




 I mean top notch celebs always wore high fashion, but fashion itself evolves over time. Rappers normally wore hood shit, there was alot of evisu and red monkey jeans. 
Streetwear itself started in the mid-late 70's/ early 80's.  brands like stussy and 10deep were specifically geared towards surfers.
Groups like Pharell and the clipse were the main reasons street wear blew up, they started wearing bape, supreme, and pharell started bbc.
I don't remember much more than that, its about when I got into clothing. Pharell came out in dem bapes and i was like I DONT KNOW WHAT THOSE ARE BUT I WANT THEM. 




 there once was a time when streetwear wasn't mainstream.  These things go in waves. Give it 5 years and there will be something else. 




 you could also check out sites like gilt, myhabit, and jackthreads.  Depending on you're area find outlet stores, nordstrom rack, saks fifth off fifth, etc.
but yah a job is pretty key, and don't get discouraged.  The amount you make is never enough, same for most everybody. 




 that second link is proper sketchy 




 If you're in the north-east you could check out barneys new york, and the tannery in Boston.  There's probably more, but those i'm 100% of. 




 pinroll 




 "reputable tailors in your city"?  




 great idea for a thread, but maybe change the title. A little misleading. But yah hope this comes through. :D 




 thanks, yah im hoping they stretch a bit. not as much as my past experience with apc. but they are a tad bit tighter than i'd normally wear. 




 for retail price they are better than I expected, and for sub $100 they far exceed my expectations.  and thanks! might shorten em a little, but figured i'd give big ass cuffs a shot.  mixed opinions on reddit and in real life haha 




 sweet, i was a little worried. out of the box they are one of the roughest pairs ive had.  was expecting the twill to be much lighter. 




 meh, they are for the ALS association. best friends dad just got diagnosed with it. made a donation and figured i'd wear the bracelets.  Normally i'd agree, but yah. circumstances. 




 http://imgur.com/a/tzmh8#0
Told myself I'd never get a pair.  Always thought I was too old for n f, thought their label was too tacky, and they had way too many gimmicks.  Found the skinny guys on karmaloop for ~$70 and figured i might as well give em a shot, seeing as how my apcs were about ready to become retired.
Sorry for the grainy quality, decent camera was too far away, and ms paint cropping.. 




 Yes they do, But if you only wear them on the weekends then just don't wash them at all.  Not because your a denim head, but because you don't want them to fade.  Hang em up and spray febreze on them every sunday night. 




 The only way their customer service could be better is if they would ship their offices to Boston so I could visit. ;)
cant wait for my kickstarter UH's and launch slims as well :D 




 It looks like monster hunter 3, and only showed more than 4 people on screen in a brief clip at the very end.  
I am very excited if it happens, but something screams skeptical. 




 Selvedge certainly does have to do with longevity. the extra stitching goes throughout making the denim itself more dense and durable.  It just happens to also ensure the edge of the denim doesn't fray (finishing edge).
realistically if your levis have lasted years then I would expect apcs to be the same, it all depends on how hard you wear them. 




 I believe the originals should be shipping this month (end of last month), and other fabrics will be shipping over the next 2 months.  Personally awaiting the Super heavy's which are slated for may shipment. 




 like Athosicus said... pretty much just hurdles, and high jump. lol 









 indigo paint. fixem' right up... 




 "curvy", "friction from walking" lol... Try a denim skirt... not much friction there... 




 keys on belt loop, everything else in shirt pockets.  If you don't have shirt pockets, then make shirt pockets.  Oh and put your eraser in the backpack, don't need dem shirts be disappearing up infront da honnies. 




 30 isn't that old, and you can still pull off streetwear without looking weird.
Streetwear unlike most sects of fashion has a huge range, spanning from skater to hip-hop to high fashion esque.  Sure a 30 year old man might not want to wear a pink camo bape hoodie, and ballin ass evisu jeans.  That would look pretty weird.  
Essentially what i'm getting at is just toning down a little bit.  Maybe pick up some 501's or other straight leg jeans, somewhere between baggy and slim.  Personally i'm even a fan of krew chinos if you want to go with a slightly more mature look.
Rather than wearing hoodies every day you could try out some LRG or mishka button ups.  Even just pick up some plain 'ole crewnecks. 
Replacing a whole sneaker rotation I dont see as being a problem, depending on your line of work.  Most grown men wear sneakers now adays.  Plus buying lots of shoes can get expensive.  But if you have the cash maybe check out some clarks desert boots.  They are more "adult" than sneakers in general, yet still look very young and hip.

Sorry to drone on, but i'm 27 and went through the same thing a few months ago.  I wore strictly streetwear for 5+ years, and am trying to move in a more mature direction.  But you always can mix in a few street staples to make a look come through.
gluck mate 




 If streetwear is just a trend then its a long lived trend.... I mean Stussy, 10deep, and vans alone have been around for 25-30 years individually.  Sure in the last 5 years the "streetwear" market has grown substantially, and I see that slowing down.  Imo it has stood the test of time, and it will always have a place in the fashion industry. 




 ACK, was ~4:00 am before work. I done goofed. 









 yah dishonored was really good.  Its just strange that these developers are all like, "need a name".  "OH I KNOW, lets pick something silly that starts with a C!" 




 dead space 3 









 boots, and general wear should do the trick 




 Aston Grey Rockcastle's.  Got em at DSW, I'd try and get into a DSW and try em on if you're thinking about buying.  They run huge, I had to size down 1.5 




 thanks, I sized 1 down.  Tried on 2 sizes down, and was really paranoid about crotch blow before they got a chance to stretch.  They are a little too big on my waist now, so i just wear an undershirt and tuck it in + belt.

Im on the same boat. Thinking of trying japan blue, or 3sixteen.  They seem to be the most comparable in value/quality.  Also hanging in to see if Gustin releases info on their 18.4oz selvedge indigo they talked about on here.  Although i'm not in a huge rush, still loving my apc's.  




 not sure exactly to be honest.  I spill chemicals on them at work from time to time, along with general wear and tear. 




 I washed them once, and I work in a factory where I wear them daily. Im guessing thats why I have significant wear around my thighs. 




 yea, essentially taking the sides in.  Giving the body a more flattering look.
Although even that might be tricky considering the pocket placement is really close to the side seam.  But i'm no tailor so it could be a non-issue. 




 be wary of breaking them in then deciding you want them hemmed.  Im guessing you meant try them on, and make up your mind. You just dont wanna start getting fades then make the fades look unnatural by hemming. 




 it was an in the moment type picture
http://imgur.com/a/wiwvn 









 not an expert, but the shoulders and arm holes look too big.  Probably not worth tailoring costs.  You could get it tapered, and maybe try it with a casual look. 




 Good lookin out, but yahh. Boston to SF is a long ways to go for a shirt. :(  Although I could deal with not being in -3 degree weather right now. haha 




 thanks for the quick response. Ya i'm pretty skinny. ~6'/150lbs, So I will probably hold out.  My local shops havn't gotten them in yet, i'm hoping they do eventually. 




 Mainly has anyone tried the fit. I need slim shirts, and they don't seem to make it in slim.
elbow honeycombs would be killer I think. 









 planetside 2... 




 give it 15-40 wears, they will size up to about a ~36.  From the waist to the bottom of your knees will stretch substantially.  So don't fret if they feel too tight.  If you like the tight look maybe check out the ns petit slims.  Can't say much for rescues, never owned a pair.
Also be careful until they do stretch.  Dont wanna blow the crotch out on a fresh pair. 




 scr8 up out da han dynasty? L Bu'in it an all dat? Teachin dem numbers? word. 




 the type on back is done beautifully. stencil, and spray? or by hand/ruler? Either way I love it. 




 my thoughts exactly. 









 I am and have always been primarily a PC gamer, and I love steam for what it is.  I just want to get other peoples opinions on what the big deal is with steam box/big picture mode.
I've had a living-room computer since the x800AIW card, which at the time was a really niche market.  But seriously. Most budget computers have hdmi out, and will be able to run more games and at a better quality than the "steambox".  Atleast with the given specs as of now, not to mention at a fraction of the cost.
A computer with HDMI out will also let you run your choice of OS whilst regular old steam at the same time.  The big picture mode web browser seems really clunky. The library section is also horrible when you have a descent sized game collection.
The lan party aspect of the steam box is intriguing, but in the same light for ~$1000 you could get a solid m-atx gaming rig with a lan case.  It wouldnt be as small, but atleast it could run AAA games decently.  Plus the steam box is marketed as a console killer, hence nix lan parties unless you are replacing your big computer with a small computer an a big TV.
Not trying to be a hater, just genuinely interested in other peoples opinions. 




 I foresee a horrible ending.. .

Don't wear your seatbelt.
Damn thats realistic 




 If you only have $10 to spend why not DS 1 2. most bang for your buck atleast.
havnt played any fear since the original, but either dead space game is better than rage or dead rising 2 imo. 




 I'm gonna brag about all these services I have, and i'm still gonna beg for ms points..
And how is this game related? 




 The World Ends With You. is amazing. 




 thx, real not repost.  They are done and belong to my friend though. Just thought /r/gaming might like too see :)

 thx was wondering this myself. 




 Dark Souls pre-purchase.  I work hard for the money I use to buy games.  Therefore I buy games I deem very worthy of my money.  I feel dark souls would be worth my money, although with speculation of it being a crumby port job I'm not sure if I can swing it with my budget.
Im not sure if you can gift pre-purchases, either way I appreciate what you're doing. Great morale boost for the community as a whole :D 




 :D Yah I stumbled across it there when I was looking for the same case myself.  Great case, great price, and ncix has great service/fast shipping.  Hope you enjoy
PS Depending on what aftermarket cooler you go with make sure you check the depth specs. my Cooler master 212 evo has about a quarter/eighth inch of clearance from the case side. 




 NCIX sells kits for around 20 bucks with a different colored logo/mesh.

 Best indie pack yet, imo 




 From what I understand they do stay forever.  Although individual server admins have the power to wipe their servers at any given point.  Essentially clear the world and start fresh.  Mainly wipes happen if the world gets over encumbered by tents/barbed wire/sandbags/etc, and or hacks.  So there isn't exactly periodic flashes, and technically given really bad luck your tent could be wiped the next day.  




 right on, didn't mean to cause a stir.  Thanks for clearing that up. 




 .. Ys origin's normal price is 11.99, not 19.99.  Flash deal price should be like ~5..  Bare in mind I just woke up and could be not thinking straight.

 I thought both the new consoles were supposed to be able to output at 4k.  how about we just wait and see about the framerate. not to mention 4k tvs/monitors  probably won't be in the average consumers houses for another 4-5 years anyhow.

 and if we're talking about the far off ps5 future I'm sure tech will evolve so as to create solutions keeping costs about at standard price. last gen was a much bigger advancement making the jump from 4:3  to 16:9  imo. 




 Every GTA game has come out on PC eventually, why is everyone so down like this one wont.

I'm not saying it will be soon, but it will likely happen eventually. 




  my computer has also been hooked up to my tv for 8 years or so. so I guess I might not be the target demographic. 




  most of the games I pay are in the steam eco-system. but not all of them, that sort of worries me. 




 If you're trying to get in shape, and new to denim I would absolutely go sub 200. Probably even cheaper.
A. make sure you actually like wearing raw denim.
B. It would suck spending a considerable amount of money on denim then losing weight.  Personally I would wait until you are happy with your weight and arent going to fluctuate much before spending big money. 




  buying multiple pairs of sub $200 denim rather than one pair of higher quality denim 




  rogue didn't cost 270 million dollars to make. 




 dreamcast  had a killer lineup.  jet grind, sonic 3d, shenmue, alot of other weird obscure imports. not to mention you can burn games on cds without modding  if your info that.
 the rest I'm impartial to, they are all good bets, but Saturn games might be a tad on the pricey side, if that matters to you. 




 2 out of 5 are free.  the rest combined are probably cheaper than this pack costs. 




 Somewhat interested in picking up a ps3. What are you looking for before I bother you for pics 




 My thoughts exactly. 




 Looks like they are working on it though. 

"The game isn't running on my Windows 8 machine. What do I do?We're sorry to say that Rogue Legacy is not officially supported by Windows 8. Some people have successfully managed to get the game running in that OS, but we can't provide support for those versions. We will be releasing an official version for Windows 8 along with the Mac and Linux versions." 




 Rogue legacy doesn't support win8. Maybe you could try running in xp compatibility mode. But not sure if there's any way. 




 Do you have windows8? 




 Trying something radically different than my usual slim fitting work wear. 









 normally don't care for pocket stitching, but those are absolutely beautiful.  Love the details.  Would love a fit pic when you get a chance! 




 not to mention, no matter how fast your network is you would have more latency streaming it to your pc than plugging your console into a monitor. 




 suspect ass mw3 




 shin megami tensei IV, Animal Crossing, Monster hunter III/IV. 
If you are in the market for a handheld system then its absolutely the way to go. 




 It will look alot better on a smaller 3ds screen, and pokemon games have never looked particularly good.  They are fun and charming. 




 co-sign, maybe I'm just getting old. But I'd rather just pay per month than having nonsense multiple currency forms and feeling bullied into paying potentially more than $15 a month on silly micro-transactions.

 because nintendo wouldn't and shouldn't give us the opportunity to fund anything, least of all being pokemon on a tv.
If they thought it was a good idea im pretty sure it would have happened 10 years ago. 




 24 hour codes dont work with the free game promotion 




 UB201's.  they wont have the metal pocket rivets, but they don't have pocket stitching.
If you dont mind pocket stitching then the levi's would work fine and probably be even a little cheaper.

 Having a good time (vita) took a few hours before I was able to concentrate on my character with everything else going on. I still get lost from time to time, but its not too bad.
About 4 hours in myself, waiting to unlock multi-play.
absolutely recommend on vita, cant attest to ps3 but im sure its great as well. 




 Not to mention OCBD's might not work depending on what he does for a living.
absolutely plain tee's, maybe try out a colored denim chambray. (personally think its a bit more casual than an ocbd) 




 If you want the 5 panel style, but don't need the brand behind it check out the ASOS brand. They are around $20, I haven't had any experience with them but for that price i recon its worth a gamble.
http://us.asos.com/search/5-panel?hrd=1 q=5+panel
 




 they've been 35-50ish for years.  roughly the same price as a 5950 authentic fitted cap.
the price will vary dependent on brand, and no they probably arent worth 25% of the construction/material price.  How would a company, particularly small brands make money if they were closer in actual vs retail pricing. 














 But we already lost Lincoln, JFK, and Hendrix... Wasn't that bad.

 Cheers, exactly the sort of info I'm looking for :)  I'll def check it! 




 I'm not looking for a single $1000 item, I'm looking to go shopping in Paris with $1000 for clothes which I believe is fairly frugal.
I thought quite a bit on where to post it, and took a shot. But im guessing in /r/expensivemalefashion they would tell me i'm being unrealistic and frugal. 




 because I'm not asking how to dress myself properly,  I'm asking for places to shop at under a budget. Perhaps local insight, if there are any French users. 




 Anywhere I should check out, looking to get a few interesting key pieces.  I know I could easily spend way more than $1000 on clothes in Paris, and am looking to make it stretch as much as possible.
Normally I'd consider myself to dress in the grey area between street wear and high fashion.  APC's/naked and famouse/Jcrew/and all sorts of different boots.
Also am specifically looking for things that would be hard to come by in the US.  I'm in Boston, so average high fashion is readily available (barneys, saks, neiman, riccardi)  Maybe some interesting mid-range french brands. The best example I can think of would be Supreme NYC, not that I would normally wear supreme but when im in NYC I go there because its such a hassle to get supreme outside of nyc.
Sorry to ramble on, and thanks in advance.

Sorry been away a few days, I'd recommend going into the retail store if you buy them.  Normally I wear a 12, and had to size down to 10.5. 




 thanks for the input guys, and yes the left pair is navy blue.  




 I wore the same pair of apc's to work atleast 4 days a week for about a year.  The only reason I stopped was because they developed some noticeable holes, and I didnt want people to ask why I never changed my pants.
Granted I work in a factory, so im guessing this is much more acceptable than day to day office wear. 




 "There are always the people who get a coat and they just look like pedo's."
priceless. 




 personally i'd go with a 5 panel cap if your gonna go with a cap at all.  Granted I guess it depends on your style.
HUF, Stussy, if your on a budget asos.
