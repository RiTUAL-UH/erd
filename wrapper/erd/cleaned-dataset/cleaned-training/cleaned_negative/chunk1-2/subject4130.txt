 He picked his words carefully. He is playing politics and hopefully he will pave the way for more libertarians 




 It's not that big of a mess really. The only thing that fucked was MCC. Everything else is going according to plan. Halo isn't dead and our hurts the franchise when people and YouTubers like that Dobbins kid keep bashing halo and saying its dead.  




 Yeah. But this is the story about how the general population finds out. The halo universe is about to be flung into chaos worse then the covie war 




 I think the point was to hook casual players on the lore. Good job to them.  




 I love capaldi. The Moff stated he is altering the writing a bit so hopefully we'll get some stellar stories 




 That was a joke. I know that all don't believe that. And I doubt he does. 




 How the fuck do you only make 500 a month? Please explain 




 I don't think he does believe that. If he does, he's never said it.  




 Libertarians don't hate poor people. Especially not more than crony republicans.  




 Don't forget rap battles every Tuesday.. 




 This question is asked legit every other day. Please use the search bar 




 I'd vote for him over any of the other candidates. He actually has values and conviction. As a libertarian, he's a step in the right direction.  




 I think that's a prereq for republicans lmao. My concern is him shoving it down throats, he stated he won't because it conflicts with his ideology of state and individual rights  




 Essentially this sub. The republican party needs a reform of its going to win shit though. Rand Paul is easily the best candidate by a long shot. Especially when you compare him to the political jokes that are Bush, Cruz, and Clinton 




 Nice work. Great legs 




 I could remove myself the situation, but it wouldn't make logical sense to do so. My issue isn't with paying taxes altogether, it's when the government spends it on stupid shit that detriments the nation. I shouldn't have to move to a third world country to avoid paying the money the government uses to blow billions of dollars. 

What he is saying is like saying: "if you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear"  




 You missed my point in its entirety. But okay 




 Are you kidding me? Your telling me I have to renounce my citizenship, leave my family, and leave my nation to stop paying taxes? Well shoot. That doesn't sound voluntary or make any logical sense. 

Either way, point being, is that if you are an American citizen, you are *forced* to pay taxes. Required by law = force.  




 I'm being forced to pay my money to the government; money that is supposed to go for legitimate shit. Not some politicians Island getaway, not for people to go the fucking movies, and certainly not for an overspending, money wasting pentagon. 




 Don't be ridiculous. Many many people in this community asked for ODST.  




 Exactly. My tax dollars shouldn't go to your R R poor or rich 




 Yeah. For he'll pay for revealing the truth 




 Feels.  




 I really don't understand how a triple A game studio can have horrible spelling 




 Shit. I misread your response. I thought you meant that in the book it's a sneak attack.  




 I like his new armor as well. But they would have had to model his old suit for only a couple of missions.  




 I DON'T CARE WHAT ANYONE SAYS. SIX IS ALIVE.  




 The way it was portrayed in Reach could have easily been a sneak attack. Plus for civilians, Reach was a simple farming planet for the most part. Although it did have big cities like Alexandria.  




 They should make their own campaign after this. 




 Ah but that wouldn't be as interesting or fun. Plus they have to get across and flesh out some of John's backstory from a different perspective, the fact that ONI are massive dickbags, and the theme of "do the ends justify the means?" somehow.

 I'm still hoping new info gets added to the mix rather then simply adding new info in terms of smaller details like Ellie being the starry night girl. 




 My thinking is that with halo 5, both sides of the coin are justified in some way. ONI because they did what was necessary to win and did what was right for morale, everyone else and John because it's morally deplorable. So we'll have that theme of "do the ends justify the means?" 




 Yeah. It's still interesting to listen to though. To hear the civie side of things and what ONI did to cover shit up. Hopefully we'll get some new info in the coming weeks. 




 Karldar. Lmao. I love it 




 Just so you so you know. The government can legit censor the internet now that it's a "public utility" the last thing we want is internet censorship 




 He can't help the way he looks. Jeez 




 I used to love this show 




 Need more. Do other trailers 




 Wizard much? 




 Seriously fuck that bitch. 




 I think it's time to remix this shit and autotune it.  




 In the first cut scene and the last. Locke tells him himself. 




 I'm going to go with the H2a cutscenes.  




 The difference between chief and Locke is that chief was a robot. Trained and brainwashed to obey orders since age 6. They won't refuse. The thing with the 4's is that they are human, thus subject to the things they make them so. 

I agree we haven't seen enough of Locke to judge, but he will obey orders without question. But we see him with a strong sense of duty, morals, and honor. Most ONI don't have that. So it's hard to say and he could go either way at this point. 




 /u/ratidiot. There are many differences between Locke and Chief. Locke had no part in any of that ONI bullshit. Literally, he is a hunter and a hit man for ONI. I'll copy and paste from waypoint:

 Locke, however, still blamed the government for failing to defend his homeworld. Arriving at the conclusion that the UNSC was incapable of protecting anyone else, he struck out on his own and became a freelancer, selecting and hunting targets of his own volition.

 While his actions were unconventional and motives born of dissent, they eventually caught the eye of the Office of Naval Intelligence. With some very specific roles in mind for the rough but talented youth, ONI approached Locke with an offer: come home and let us train you to be even better. Finally sensing an opportunity to find greater purpose, Locke found the strength to let go of his resentment, and entered an extensive training program.

He was a dissenter before, and did not like ONI. If they ask him to do something like kill innocents, or something that violates his morals. He won't do it. Hard evidence? In nightfall when his team member approached him about screwing over everyone else, he vehemently refused even though he could have died and CONSISTENTLY stuck to his morals that entire time. You think he's going to abandon his morals because some asshole in ONI (whom he had resented) ordered him too? Not likely.

If he is after chief, he really believes chief to be in the wrong. I can't even imagine Locke and Chief being black and white enemies. Locke is definitely NOT an ONI lapdog. He might do what they say, but he has limits, plus a dark side to do what needs to be done if he thinks it's for the greater good.  




 Move on and improve. She obviously doesn't care about you. If you stay she'll only do it again. 




 His character itself. Looking at him in nightfall, he was very moral. Someone like that doesn't agreeably do things that conflict with it 




 In a way, yes. But his character is a bit more complex then simply a lapdog. He does what he does for ONI because he feels it is morally right, when that feeling goes away. He questions his superiors.  




 *Flawed legacy* as a title in the Halo 2 soundtrack. Just so happens that master chiefs legacy has been a bit flawed and doctored up by ONI as evident by the h2 promo pic.

HALOUMINATI CONFIRMD. 









 Palmer is seriously an ONI lapdog that generally doesn't question orders. Plus Del Rio was doing the yelling in that situation and he's not ONI. When ONI told palmer to kill Halsey, she went all out lap dog, hanging tongue and all. 

On the other hand, Locke is a realist with strong morals. He does what he's told by ONI without question for the most part. 




 Fucking dope 




 True.  




 Fuck yes. Powerstroke master race 





























 I want to. But I have no money coupled with a stacked reading list as it is. I was wondering who on this sub is getting it tomorrow. 


































 Me and my buddy were arguing about the relationship of light years in distance and time. Whether time is related to light years. I was in favor of time being related because I thought the distance of a lightyear was measured by the distance light would travel in a year, so my title would be correct. Am I stupid? 






















































 Is there a comprehensive timeline of all halos events?

I'm confused with the spartan III program. After watching HaloFollowers video, I'm curious whether the S4 program overlaps with the S3s, at that point, what would be the point of having two spartan programs at the same time, looking at you Delta company. 

How many S4s are out there? Same with S3s? It says many got assigned to various branches, and other types of teams like Noble Team exist? If so, do we have any info on them? 




 Josh Holmes confirmed this via twitter. Some of the best times were had getting different armor permutations and customizing my spartan to be unique. This hurts the longevity of the franchise; halo was the only FPS that allowed you to totally alter your appearance to be unique to you.

 They've said that the arena is only a small part of the game and they have much bigger multiplayer and co-op experiences. They have also said that this is the largest halo game yet. I'd like if the capacity of custom games and gamemodes was something like MAG. 

If you don't know what MAG is, it stands for Massive Action Game and featured huge battles with 256 players. All other game modes would be still be possible 









 Halo 5 needs to have unprecedented custom game options and an amazing forge. Here is my list of things that will foster a great community, amazing games, laughs, and memories. Some of these are features have been in past halo games and were successful; and they should be expanded upon. If these features are implemented, we will see a return of machinima, customs, clans, forgers, and much more content creation. 

- **Easy, fluid UI**. Take Reach for example and add some handy features from 4. I should be able to view who is in my friends game and what they are doing. Plus join in progress option for custom games. And not buggy as hell for fucks sake.

- **clan system**. For the love of God, give us some way to organize our group of friends or clan. This is vital to many players. A way to search and find clans would be great

- **many custom game options**. We should be able to alter the game to our liking for customs. 

- **The forge needs to be amazing**. Big forge maps. Large budget etc etc. Bigger pallet, more vehicles, etc, etc. Creativity is key in all of this. It was suggested that there should be a PC map editor and creator that let's you create awesome detailed maps, then upload to Xbox.

- **More theater and HD capture options**

- **custom games browser or customs matchmaking** even the ability to rent a server would be sweet. 

- **working and active file browser system**  there needs to be something to show off and display peoples work. Whether that be screenshots, maps, videos, or gametypes. I should be able to search users, tags, titles, maps, and gametypes to find content, and you should be able to upload videos that you make in the upload studio and machinima videos to the file browser. Allow for checking file shares pre-game also. This should be available on launch.

I want to go onto halo waypoint.com or forge hub and click a download button, and have it pop up on my Xbox in my stored files.

- this one is the most controversial. **loadouts and armor abilities for custom games** they were always fun to use in mini games and added a fun dynamic to custom games, they did add strategic elements to BTB games. However i do not want them in the arena. I'd also like to be able to alter the power and range of the spartan abilities.

These have no affect on matchmaking or the arena at all and I'd like to know what the community thinks about this. Hopefully 343 can implement these features. 




 I thoroughly enjoyed this series and the insight into the development process; gave us a look into how hard it is to make the games. Toward the end, Josh Holmes said that this is the "biggest halo game to date", so they must have a lot in store for halo 5. It would also be cool to see the size of 343 and halo's development process if we see more sprint again. 









 They could do seasonal/biseasonal storylines. Imagine playing as Johnson on harvest or during his S1 days. ODST 2? Or maybe develop John some more by playing as him during the insurrection or a pivotal mission, or even Locke in a spy thriller type thing.

 If they switched it from a firefight hybrid to a full on weekly episodic campaign with cutscenes built in, it would be amazing. With a good couple months between seasons to hype people, it would give thousands of people a reason to start up halo 5 while covering cool canon in the process.

343 pls 




 It is an amazing idea for halo and e-sports. HCS could very well grow halo into a top e sports game again, similar to CoD, DOTA, LoL. It will take a couple years but I can see it happening with halo 5. 




 I've been seeing many redditors say various things about Halo 5, and i do not think there has been an in depth analysis of the gameplay done yet; so here is mine. People were attracted to Halo because it was **competitive and fun**. It allowed people to be creative and bond with others while random objects hurled at you as you struggled to keep balance; then go hardcore competitive on Guardian and fuck people up. Halo 4 failed in both of these regards. This is why I think Halo 5 will be a *quality* Halo game. Although, people will still get pissed off, this has happened with all of the Halo's.

I believe Halo 5 to be the opposite of CoD so let me explain why the game will be a Halo game. I get where most of you are coming from because i was skeptical as well, and of course there are things I don't like and want removed, but the game itself will be competitive and will have a skill gap. It appears to me many didn't look at the gameplay, pro reviews, and vidocs before drawing to conclusions. Although it's possible to dislike the gameplay for various reasons, disliking it for being CoD or casual is where you are wrong. Halo 4 was more Call of Duty than Halo 5 is... by a long shot.

Putting the H5 gameplay on the same level as Call of Duty is absolutely ridiculous; Destiny, Call of Duty, Halo 4, and Titanfall couldn't be further apart from this game. Everything Halo 4 did goes against Combat dynamic that exemplified the previous games. Halo 5 simply does not, it alters it, yet sticks to the values of a Halo game. Plus there are many other things that makes a Halo game other than multiplayer, like campaign which will be nothing short of stellar. 

There is a reason Halo fell out of mainstream popularity by mid halo 3 and people jumped ship to Call of Duty. The gameplay became stale and slow, not because CoD was easier. Then Bungie went and changed it in all the wrong places... at that point 343 continued this trend with Halo 4. And from a market perspective, they had to learn from halo 4 or else they wouldn't have a decent fanbase and their effort null; simple economics. Thus the reason why they hired pro players to advise development around the game; they ***NEED*** h5 to be competitive and fun. So the last thing they are going to make is a no-skill casual game, but a game casuals can enjoy non the less. And they wouldn't just keep the pro's around as PR because it is a waste of money and the pro's wouldn't want to be apart of an organization where they are being used. 

At the moment and for the foreseeable future, there will not be a new good arena (not CoD style) shooter on the market until halo 5, which halo has on lockdown (pun intended lel). It's clearly the corner of the market they are pursuing and rightly so. To get Halo back to where it should be (on top), they need to evolve the gameplay while retaining that arena style, which they (finally) understand. You wanna look at a cash cow, look at CoD. At least 343 cares about the community.

**Mechanics and Values**

Alright, time to get mechanical. When you look at Halo, what makes it great? What makes halo different from all of the rest and not like a CoD game or any of the sort? It boils down to Halo's core values as an arena shooter, something CoD is not; CoD is an arcade shooter. So to make a successful Halo game, it cannot violate a simple core.


**The core values are:**

1. - map control 
2. - power weapon control
3. - skill gap (challenging gameplay)
4. - equal starts 
5. - competitive environment 
6. - Strategic thinking
7. - risk  reward decision making 
8. - simplicity 
9. - fluid map movement

Halo 5 meets every single one of these requirements and I can explain why. 1, 2, 4, 5 are evident by the spartan chatter, power weapon counters, and equal loadouts. The chatter and counters are going to make players more aware of the map and general environment; map and weapon control will be more prevalent in this game then in past Halo's, forcing casuals to be more competitive if they want to win rather than just walking around the map throwing nades and shooting, making them invest time and effort in the game and turning casuals into hardcore fans. 
 
I'll explain further, competitive environment: the game is introducing spartan chatter and weapon counters, changes making the game more accessible... yes. But competitively accessible, so people will be more involved with the game and teamwork will be fostered creating a skill gap and challenging gameplay; which is what halo is all about correct? Currently, most players will walk around the map with no conscious direction. Now more players will be aware of the map and power weapons, causing more fun and tactical carnage. Other factors play into this, these aren't isolated values.

Next is strategic thinking, combine the competitive environment with the movement abilities you will get people being tactical in their next move (unlike halo 4 where sprint had no counter or balance), adds a whole new dynamic. As for the "Cut and run strategy" I agree it isn't halo but it was countered by a variety of aspects in the game including no shield recharge, and you are not at full speed when running. The pro's who bashed halo 4 for the reason people are bashing halo 5 claim the new movement abilities are well balanced compared to Halo 4. It's more of the classic risk-reward aspect which adds strategic ability while sticking to the arena style. You will still be able to fight back if an enemy gets first shot, you will be able to strafe, and out BR noobs.  

Simplicity is justified because, well, it's not as simple as previous installments. But Halo 5 is much simpler than Call of Duty and adds to the strategic element of the game, (unlike CoD) Fluid map movement has a solution, they need to design arena maps with this in mind which they are doing. This still lets crouch jumping happen, but adds to it. No doubt you are going to be able to reach new heights and new ways to engage in combat. I see people crouch jumping so they can clamber onto new areas. All of this contributes to a large skill gap and a skilled game... unlike any other on the market. These are my $0.02

TL;DR: Halo 5 will be a good game with map and power weapon control. Will be competitive arena. I welcome *intelligent* debate.

 I'd personally love it. If they actually continued it and did various seasons, 343 could cover many aspects of the universe such as playing as an ODST or marine, Human - forerunner war. They could even go back and make a mission based around ghosts of onyx or any other book. 

Imagine playing Sgt Johnson during the battle of harvest. It would be fucking awesome. The whole episodic campaign thing is a great idea if they made it more campaign like, less firefighty, and 25 episodes per season. Probably a long shot but they could contract episodes to saber and cutscenes to blur. 

343 pls 




 My list:

- **Increase player count to at least 24**

- include custom loadout options for custom games.

- working, easy file share system on launch

- The fucking ability to *JOIN CUSTOM GAMES IN PROGRESS* FAK

- Obviously a better forge system than h2a. Even though h2a forge is pretty awesome.

-  more vehicles to compliment the new btb gameplay as well as a bigger weapon sandbox. Keep in mind that arena 4v4s can stay the same.

- More custom games options

- working competitive ranking system on launch

If you have anything else, please post below.

 Halo is a competitive shooter and requires an arena style. I see people flip shit when anything deviates from h2 when it comes to h5. Halo needs to be a fun, challenging, arena shooter but CANNOT solely cater to competitive kids. It should be fun for casuals also and I hope 343 realizes this. I'm going to list how both can be accomplished.

Halo's gameplay has very unique properties that make it fun. I'm not going to go into specifics about game mechanics/ideas, there are tons of community content out there about it, but here are the core requirements halo *must* have to be successful: 

 - **Arena** Equal starts, map control, power weapon control, and tactics. 

 - **Customization** The ability to mold the game to your liking. This includes forge, custom game options, ability to customize your spartan to be unique only to you, and theater options. 

These are things no other current popular game does, halo has a grasp on the market for them; halo's niche. (To clarify, these aspects are not competing with one and other, they can go hand in hand) its very possible to make a game both halo competitive and casual fun. In implementing these things, 343 will have made a fun halo game everyone can enjoy.

In my opinion if 343 services these aspects of the game and expands them further than the previous halo levels of competitive and customization, then we will have a successful halo game. My worry is that 343 will release a game that is too focused on the competitive and just leave out many customization options because a bunch of whiny competitive kids complain when 343i adds something like an option for sprint and loadouts in custom games. When I load up h5, I don't want to feel like I'm playing the MLG playlist, nor some CoD bullshit, but I want it to feel like Halo Team Slayer. Then I want to load some fun custom games with a *24 player lobby*   

I'm interested to read the opinions I've likely generated...
I found this funny: http://imgur.com/L1aZxWJ

EDIT: I believe all additions to halo must meet these basic requirements or at least not hinder them. 









 Halo and destiny clan. If you need people to do the raid, strikes or nightfall, we are creating a group for it. We will be running MCC as well when it comes out.

The criteria is to be mature, intelligent and at least lvl 25.

www.bungie.net/en/clan/Xbox/574683 




 Looking for some cool, mature and intelligent people to join a destiny clan.

If you want to join, you should be a halo fan due to the clan most likely doing both destiny and halo upon MCC release. The clan may turn into a military styled clan later on down the road depending on what people want to do. The Clan is set up as a group to play destiny with and accomplish shit. (raid, nightfall, strikes etc.)

Go here if you want to join or find out more. 
Thanks 




 Edit: I'm a lvl 27 warlock. Void. I use an auto rifle with legendary sniper, for close quarters I switch to invective. I'm just noticing I get to few kills then the rest of the fireteam.

 I'm genuinely curious to know what libertarians think of Rand and a possible presidential bid. 

I've seen him be bashed as being not like his father and a sell out from libertarians, and be praised as well. 

If he runs, will you vote for him? If he gets the nomination, would you vote for him? How do you think he'd do? Can he compete with the others? 




 I imagine it starts something like this:

 In recent years, scouts has made headlines for various reasons and many of those has been homosexuals in scouting. Within these headlines we see accounts of sexual abuse in troops on the part of adults and youth and scouts has received a bad name because of it. It has also gotten a bad name because of its policy on not allowing gays in the organization; a rock and a hard place. Like most debates, this one has two equally compelling sides.

BSA has taken many steps attempting to curb sexual abuse in scouting; mainly by enforcing policies. And they recently decided to allow openly gay youth in the organization, but not allowing openly gay adults. The one side says this opens the door to sexual abuse, violates the bible, and that scouting is a religious organization (mainly for the moral guidance imo), also that scouting is a private organization and can conduct itself how it wants. It has been that way for years and is fine, people don't ask if you're gay, you don't tell. No harm done. 

The pro gay side says that it's time to open up scouting for gays and get into the 21st century. It is unfair for people to be excluded based on sexual orientation. Both sides have compelling arguments and BSA knew this. But to the best of my knowledge, BSA gets funding from both human rights organization and religious institutions, both sides threatening to cut funding. Everyone in this sub can agree scouting is a great thing and is one of the best things to happen to this country and that we need more of it. It was already getting bad press before this issue as well as falling numbers, then this happens --- more bad press, people leave on both sides due to the issue. So whichever they picked, people will be upset. And the majority of charters are with churches. Scouting was put in a bad spot.

As a libertarian and an Eagle scout I respect both sides of the argument and in my opinion, it would be easier to simply leave it to the troops, the districts or even the councils. Forcing people to adapt when they aren't ready is an issue as well as excluding them. I believe the troops or people more closely connected with those that would be affected are better apt to make this decision. For example, a troop that has adults that are older more conservative men that have spent years contributing to scouting and are wonderful people with so much knowledge to pass on to youth, or if a troop has young men as leaders that are more open minded. 

Scouting is based around personal responsibility and building leaders as well as developing decision making. The troops/districts/council should be able to decide for themselves. Irdk how anyone will feel about this. I'll probably catch a lot of hate lol.

**Edit/update:** I'd like to make my stance known as I don't hate nor want to exclude gays or atheists, both have a place in scouting if they so choose. I understand why this post gathered as much hate as it did.

 As a young person joins scouts, they generally don't have a concept of sexuality until the middle or HS years, so the issue is irrelevant and is for youth. The issue is not discussed or cared about, most troops will not discriminate as long as the person lives scoutly, my troop wouldn't and few troops would shove a person out based on that, even if the decision is left to councils. And I highly doubt anything would really change, the debate gets overthought beyond what would realistically happen. Very few troops would struggle just as few are now. 

The point of compromise of leaving it up to a council preferably. Is that they can decide whether they are ready for that change, not morally but the affects of it (funding from either side, membership, community support etc.) one way or another, BSA suffers. The argument is irrelevant for youth because they are currently allowed. And if the decision for adults is left to councils. I doubt they would ask off the bat when someone joins... Simply because it doesn't matter unless you're a homophobe and I believe most if not all councils would allow them. 

Atheism has come up quite a few times. Once again, they should not be excluded and most people don't care. The rule states that you must believe in a higher power, that is all. A comment below summed it up nicely as if you believe in aliens as more powerful beings than you pass if you don't happen believe in god. But if by chance you believe humans are alone, then you should be allowed to be openly atheist but must still respect the establishment as it is. For many in scouting, religion is a pillar for moral guidance that helps the scout way and by the time one decides they are atheist, they are adolescent, so they've made the decision. Young people can still use the moral pillar of it .So there is no need to fit the program for a minority even though they should be allowed. This whole thing got blown out of proportion. 




 I was just wondering. I'm an arena style halo player so I avoid the crucible. Anyone else feel the same? It just seems to unbalanced to me. Better than CoD though hah

It completely goes against what a Vet is. 




 Many many people absolutely love halo 5. It's not a joke. Plus the campaign hype.

 Yeah, so... what is happening here. 




 No. I'm an honest man. If I don't think you're beautiful, I won't say it. I will generally say what I think (amazing, cute, pretty) On the otherhand, I hate insulting people.  




 It's halo 4 on crack. But I think its because people dummy expect much from it and they can mod the living hell out of it. 




 If it is, we better get to see an updated old forerunner architecture style.

 Is his beginner program for muscle and weight building worth it? I saw it on YT and seemed solid. But I wasn't sure 




 Yeah, Bungie had this weird thing where they had tiers for the legitimacy of their canon. It went: games, books/comics, then advertising. So they had no problem throwing away the book for the game. 




 He seems to be enjoying himself 




 Wait bro, it just appeared there!? Nobody put it there?  




 Yeah. But that look (albeit slightly different) had looked badass for a hundred years. The faggy mullet was just an 80s thing, just like the bieber cut was a 2000s thing. 




 Bellatrix on point. 




 These are beyond badass 




 That's pretty sweet 




 Gears of Halo Theft Auto 5 




 Honestly, half the guys on here think their appearance is the reason they aren't getting girls. Unless you are a 1 and have horrible personal hygiene, it's probably your mindset and attitude.  




 Would date 




 You're definitely not ugly.  




 Great eyes. But need better pic 




 I think you're really cute. 




 Reach has 25k tops. Impressive, but it's not that high 




 Yeah, clearly that's Kevin Bacon 




 That's awesome 




 Best candidate in the race at the moment. He signals a wave of change for the party as it stands.  




 Well.... DID IT WORK!? 




 Most certainly.  




 I'll vote for him over fucking Hilary.  




 Well, America did do that. 




 Solid 8. 




 I always figured he was the guy that founded the S4's. Not sure though 




 Shit. That was my pre-halo game. 




 All. No two ways about it. 

All 




 - Ben: But I..
- Sully: Glassed planets have bad records
- Ben: found people..
- Sully: GLASSED PLANETS
- Ben: That..
- Sully: GGAAAAALLLLAAASSSSED PLAAANNEETS. 

fuck Ben we've been over this. Shit 




 Seriously. Fuck this bitch. Even if you're a democrat. You shouldn't vote for her. Reminds of season 1  2 Claire underwood. 




 Communism. 




 I think it's the dude you play as in that Nintendo game where you smash pots. 




 Dislike haircut. Everything else on point 




 He emailed 343 to confirm it 




 He emailed 343 to confirm it's legitimacy 




 I am buying it. I'm just saying.. 




 Should have put an option for non buyers.  




 That's hilarious 




 First pic is the best. Brings out dem big eyes. What you're worried about isn't a big deal. 




 Yo hmu sometime. You're super pretty and your eyes go great with your hair. Fuckin love redheads. 




 Brah you fine 




 Not ugly 




 Official twitter for reference: https://twitter.com/22052124e?s=09 














 You can find it on YouTube 




 Stop. Just stop.  




 Redheads. Yes. 




 Yeah, us. I'm hoping halo 5 has a file share system, and a quality theater system that doesn't rely on that fucking upload app. 




 I miss reach in general. NBNS MLG settings are EASILY the best of the series. 




 THAT THEREZ A KEEPER.  




 Hagrid and his dad 




 I like it. I accept it 




 I'd feel horrible if my sibling got a letter and I didn't. I'd be like "good for you"


  Fuck 




 Please explain more.  




 I laughed. Wtf even is that 




 Honestly, start watching videos on tips, tricks, callouts. Start playing in PGL ladders. Sign up on their site and work your way up 




 - Forge world

- Target locator

- Pelican 




 I want spartan ops back. It didn't go well because they did it so cheaply, mixed it with firefight, and never released a new season. If they actually had good environments, more seasons and made it a legitimate episodic campaign with seasonal storylines from around the universe. It would be the greatest thing ever 




 And people still trust the government to control the internet. Lmao 




 I enjoy his views on this. But on /r/futurology. There was discussion of him talking about a "guaranteed basic income"  




 Yeah, I've died multiple times because I accidentally scoped in on the sword. I was thoroughly embarrassed.  




 Unjerk.
I got into a debate on r/halo about it. The thread about stop saying halo is dead. And I mentioned this exact video and got called on it. When people, especially YouTubers do this, it hurts halo. 




 GOD DAMIT. I didn't really want her involved. 

Edit: Damn. I got negged to shit. They killed her off in halo 4 in an epic way. It would be cheap to bring her back and make the whole reason chief went AWOL, and by extension Locke's mission about cortana. So we're going to spend  that whole campaign hunting chief or playing as chief......   for cortana. Come on. That's so cheap and predictable 




 Is this official? It looks like cortana or... 




 Yeah. Classically liberal is close to libertarianism. But liberal doesn't have the same connotation anymore. 




 Pertaining to MCC. They do deserve the criticism. But at this point its beating a dead horse. Going on about it at this point does nothing. They put their name on games like spartan assault, MCC, and others because they are the franchise. This doesn't mean they focused on it while taking away from the main project.

I wouldn't say their priorities are broken. They had a very specific timeframe to release things with two completely separate teams. Plus, they needed to have enough time to implement beta feedback. Why delay the beta and put that project at risk because of MCC. To many chefs in the kitchen isn't a good thing. And the overwhelming majority at 343 are on h5.

343 aren't the ones working on ODST and relic. Saber and certain affinity are the ones on that. They didn't even start ODST until after release.

They released Forge Island based on feedback, changed in game H4 settings for feedback, H5 is being changed based on feedback. They are listening to the general consensus on things

343 is a competent company. Only real fuck up this gen was MCCs release. Everything else has been fine. It's just that Dobbins is beating a dead horse. 343 knows that MCC had a shitty release and they know people disliked h4; they've heard it a million times. At this point it adds nothing to discussion and Dobbins perpetuates this attitude toward halo that doesn't help. 




 No, his anger and frustration are what is needed for 343 to get their head out of their wallets and realize what people want. It's the ignorance of so many people like yourself that just assume 343 is going to pull through when their record shows they have failed at everything they have done before. 

Halo 4, fail. Did they alter anything quickly to fix the problems, hell no, they were focused on MCC. MCC, fail. Have they altered and patched the problems accordingly, no. They have taken their time because the majority of their team is on Halo 5.

You assume that they fully developed MCC. It makes no sense to take people off halo 5 to work on MCC. None at all. Plus you assume they could have just altered some shit and and it would have been all hunky dory.

Now with that track record, the only record 343 has with games, what makes you think H5 is going to be any different? Dobbins and others who criticize them, like myself, don't wish for Halo to fail, but want people to stop accepting and promoting 343 to just keep doing what they are doing. All he is saying is don't listen to this bullshit 'Locke vs. Chief' hype and pre-order or buy this game before you know what you're getting. 

You assume people dont know what they're getting, even though they've played a beta that they enjoyed. One that ran more smooth than MCC. Criticism is fine. Making click bait circle jerk titles like "you hate halo if you pre-order halo 5" is not.

Look at it this way, Bungie took 3 years to produce each of their 4 games from Halo CE to Reach, 343 will have produced 3 games in 3 years with DLC already in the works prior to H5 release. Priorities have been set for 343 and it's worth betting that they have not learned from their mistakes with the way things have been going

You straight up assume 343 has hands on developed every halo title. They had other studios do them while they focused on the main title at hand (H5) You also assume they have DLC in development. The MCC dlc is being done by separate companies while 343 is focused on H5. They still stick to the 3 year dev cycle.

You also assume 343 hasn't done anything right. Even though we have HCS, good lore, and had a well received beta. 

You also seem to assume they aren't listening to any feedback, even though they have the feedback program and made a halo 5 update post where they flat out implemented community feedback. Just because they aren't listening to *your* feedback, and dobbins. Doesn't mean they aren't listening. 

Dobbins really is leading an overreacted crusade against nothing. And hurting halo in the process. 




 You're making a lot of assumptions there 




 At least that was black and white. Shoot the big blargy aliens. It was an epic struggle. 

But if the UNSC and humanity are flung into a legitimate civil war, the floods possible return, Halsey/Jul with the Janus Key, and covie religion making a comeback. I'd say that's pretty bad. But I doubt it'll happen 




 I'm calling it now. At the end of the series, Ben gets offed after he releases his info. The UNSC and humanity descend into complete chaos as ONI lies are revealed  




 The competitive scene won't die in halo 5. Plus, a huge amount of people enjoy the game.  




 Think about it bro. A legitimate inter UNSC civil war, covies and Halsey getting ahold of the Janus key hellbent on revenge and a flood return. 




 - HCS is rising and the competitive scene is beginning to rise again
- Lore has been handled wonderfully with books, comics, and merch.
- Halo is gaining more content creators, YouTubers, and fan sites. Compared to the dying of Reach and 4
- Halo 5 is looking extremely promising so far. From a story perspective and MP
- MCC is functional, 343 is working around the clock to bring the next TU.
- no longer is this sub and every halo forum filled with anti 343 circle jerk. We are seeing discussion, awesome clips and more. 

Halo isn't dad. We just have to accept that halo isn't the top dog mainstream game anymore. And work to be a friendly community newcomers want to be apart of.  




 Dobbins posted a video called "if you pre order halo 5 you hate halo" the thumbnail was "do you hate halo?" And he acts like he's in some fucking crusade to save halo by bashing it.

His intentions may be good, but perpetuating halo hate is undeniably bad for the franchise. The comments on that video were just a huge circlejerk that said fuck 343.  




 I'm referring to this generation.
