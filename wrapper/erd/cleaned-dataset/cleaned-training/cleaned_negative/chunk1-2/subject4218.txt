 Not sure if you're serious, but this reads like a somewhat tasteless joke. 




 I really wish this had happened. Gollum was written for Lennon. 









 yyyyyyikes. 




 Yeah, I understand Nolan's use of the terms. I thought you were asserting that Tesla is literally a magical spells-and-potions wizard in the film, which would be silly.

You make an interesting point about Tesla's "wizardry" being beyond explanation even by our standards--my interpretation was that while we are not privy to the mechanics of cloning, it does obey rational physical laws. This is in keeping with the film's articulation of the tension between ugly reality and blissful illusion as the nature of life, supported in Hugh Jackman's dieing monologue. I'll have to see how your reading stacks up next time I watch it.

 Tesla's a scientist, in real life and in the movie; if he's perceived as a wizard it's a result of the time he's in. The cloning **machine** is an element of science fiction, not fantasy. 




 I agree with you on the point of the movie--there is no magic and we purposely avoid that fact--but I take the cloning machine at face value. What's important is that it is a scientific explanation within that world, even if it doesn't work outside of it. 




 You know, I had similarly written it off until I read Hulk's thoughts on it; it really is an unusually relentless look at aging, wasted potential, compromise and lack thereof. I think some of its dismissal stems from how unpleasant it is to explore these themes, particularly for those of us who had or have some idealistic relationship to art a.k.a. the people most likely to watch arty flicks like Greenberg. We are its audience and the target of its criticism, which is why we've sort of collectively put it out of our minds. It's not exactly one of my favorites this year, but I'm definitely glad Hulk made me revisit it. 




 This is *exactly* right, and it's exactly why the movie's absurd violent-mission-from-god premise and unwavering misogyny are so troubling. 




 ...
...
are we saying that *wasn't* fucking absolute nonsense? 




 Knowing scales and chord structure are crucial. Rather than trying to find every individual note every time, be conscious of your key and train your hand to follow natural chord shifts. 




 that's strange, as learning how to play songs pretty much the entire point of Rock Band's pro mode. times change i suppose. 




 Leboski is stupid the first time you see it and brilliant the second--it's a law of thermodynamics or something. 




 The scene in which Willem Defoe appears alongside the protagonists in flashback is pretty cool. Literally everything else about it is complete fucking nonsense. 




 I think it's very much a movie about storytelling--not story structure or craftsmanship, but simply what comes out when you turn on the creativity tap. This might be offputting to people expecting traditional narrative beats, but I think it works marvelously as an exploration of everyday creativity. 




 Hmmm. So to recap, the commenter above me is upset because he/she thinks r/atheism is unfairly characterized as a circlejerk. I respond by saying it sort of *is* a circlejerk, which is especially problematic for a community that supposedly privileges rational thought. If you think my criticism is tired and worthless then so be it, but I'd argue that it's a tired and worthless response to an equally tired and worthless argument--of course there are plenty of assholes, of course there's great content buried there, of course r/atheism feels like it's being picked on. I would speculate that the karma discrepancy between our two posts has more to do with opinion agreement than discussion fostering; thankfully I don't care about karma. **When I read the OP's post, I didn't downvote it, I dashed off a quick rebuttal.** Which is also what you did; thank you for your reply, you're part of the solution, etc.

As for the actual worthlessness of my post, that judgement seems to be based in the idea that the problems it raises are long solved: you here point to the two debate subreddits; I was at the time unaware of them. Even if these subreddits *did* solve the debate deficit, their lack of visibility is problematic: r/atheism does nothing to promote these subreddits as an outlet, and as you say elsewhere, they're sorely lacking in content. I'd also add that it furthers an unhelpful binary of atheists and believers, which exacerbates the warlike upvote/downvote behavior; there are compelling arguments to be had *within* r/atheism about the personal and institutional roles of religion and what atheism should mean to the world at large. **So: if these subreddits *do* answer my issues, they're doing so poorly. But they really don't, eh?**

I therefore propose that my criticism stands; that r/atheism remains excessively homogeneous, that labeling and marginalizing dissent to separate subreddits isn't good enough, that a culture change is is in order. It's time for r/atheism to express itself not just in votes but comments, to answer critics rather than silence them. Yes, "hivemind" and "cirlejerk" are problems bigger than r/atheism, and **yes, I am unfairly holding r/atheism to a higher standard because of what it claims to represent.**

So rise to it, r/atheism. Keep your memes and opinion reinforcement if you must--it's worthless, it's junk food, that's fine, whatever. **I'm just saying, next time you feel like downvoting dissent, put it into words.** We can have a discussion. 




 many kinds of fashion shoes? please, tell me more! 




 yup, i hear ya. 




 great call listing those two subreddits, they really ought to be linked in the sidebar!

On downvotes, I feel like perhaps you're making two different defenses here: first that r/atheism transcends downvoterism, then that maybe it suffers from downvoterism but that's not r/atheism's fault. As a regular reader and occasional commenter, I feel the latter is far more accurate, but that's just my opinion.

There is also the fact that pretty obvious/tired jokes and links get a whole lot of love, but that is of course subjective and again not unique to r/atheism. reddit is a circlejerk, really. 




 pfffff I am the problem. Don't worry everyone, "the problem" has been isolated, turns out it's me, no big deal.

Seriously darling, I hope you don't think I'm bitching about Karma, because really, what the fuck is a karma. Can I eat it? Will it heat my home? Can I impress potential employers with it?

What's far more real to me is discussion. To the extent that reddit's karma system fosters intelligent discussion, hurray. To the extent that is stifles it, boo. Now shut up and kiss me you animal. 




 well, I do think "central" is a subjective term; what Colbert takes to be central to Catholicism will be different from the pope will be different from outsiders. That is of course religion as personal rather than institutional, but I think that's as it should be. 




 somebody almost immediately downvoted that post; I found that so funny that I downvoted it too. 




 Colbert is a good example of positive theism, in my opinion--his Catholicism not only gives him personal happiness, it gives him personal responsibility as well. Good on him. 




 Perhaps the charge of "circlejerk" stems from a lack of two-sided discussion? Opposing viewpoints are often downvoted rather than addressed, which not only makes the subreddit boring, but is somewhat ironic for a group that allegedly prizes logical discourse. 




 I get it! You answer unspecified allegations of racism by saying he thinks you're an infidel! Because he's Muslim! Irony! Good one! 









 Yeah, it will typically involve some selective interpretation. But no matter how silly such behavior might seem to us, hostile mischaracterization isn't helpful. 




 here's the thing: when a religious person falls ill and accepts medical treatment, they know damn well that medicine is keeping them alive; they simply see doctors and medicine as a part of God's plan for them, perhaps a result of prayer. The kid did not learn a valuable lesson about how medicine works, he already knew that. Instead, he learned that atheists are petty assholes, and that is what any other person of faith would take from this as well. 




 am i misunderstanding something? do you people *actually* think this stuff is pushing forward the cause of free thought?

Oh, you're just masturbating each other. Pardon the intrusion. 




 yikes. 




 oh ho ho ho atheist doctors killing religious children. that's good for the cause, eh? 




 fair enough, and I understand that in initially failing to articulate my point I came off as a bit of a troll. the critic smartly characterizes this list as "20 films [she] adored," which is a great way of putting it that I can't argue with at all. And while I might cringe at some of these consciously low-profile inclusions and high-profile exclusions, on some level I'm probably just a bit jealous that *White Material* didn't play anywhere near me. 




 Out of touch with wider cinema culture and how it reflects what what happened artistically and commercially in 2010, out of touch with what will be remembered from this year, out of touch with a number of very good films--some better than those included on the list--because limited or non-existent release was a prerequisite. And that's what bothers me, Winkyburger, when this form of art that I love is co-opted by people more concerned with exclusivity than quality.

And honestly, not trying to be a jerk, but I really don't know what are you arguing at this point. Are you saying that this list *is* a perfect expression of what happened in film 2010? Are you saying that it's not but we should pretend that it is? Please clarify. 




 oh holy shit yes. 




 you're insulted because I said that the indiewire blog's top 20 films isn't authoritative? that's silly, winkyburger. by all means, it can assert itself however it likes--and it does say "my" top 20 when you follow the link--but if I want to say that it's a bit out of touch then what difference does it make? Am I not furthering the discussion in doing so? 




 Just pointing out that it's a bit out of touch--favoring minor Polanski over the Social Network seems a choice made in the interest of deliberate obscurity rather than reflection of quality, you know?

I'm more than happy to share my top 10, presented here in alphabetical order. It does, of course, reflect my wholly subjective cinematic values.

Exit Through the Gift Shop (Banksy)
Four Lions (Chris Morris)
Inception (Christopher Nolan)
The Kids Are Alright (Lisa Cholodenko)
Mother (Bong Joon-ho)
A Prophet (Jacques Audiard)
Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World (Edgar Wright)
The Social Network (David Fincher)
Toy Story 3 (Lee Unkrich)
True Grit (Joel and Ethan Coen)

Open to discussion and criticism of course. :)

 




 oh i definitely agree that approaching Mormonism from both sides affords a  far *more* objective perspective than those simply within. And as I say, it's no slight on the group by any means. Just trying to be conscious of how r/atheism is perceived by rational outsiders, mostly. 




 ha touch. but to elaborate further, this list might best be titled "20 Best Films That Didn't Play in Mainstream Theaters," or "20 Films to Impress Your Film Class." This list has some great picks, but it's not *the* List of Films 2010 by any stretch. 




 I'll leave my panties as they are, thanks. I harbor no Mormon sympathies myself, but ex-Mormon is literally the opposite of objective. Literally! That's no slight on ex-Mormons or the vibrant and insightful ex-Mormon subreddit, it's just how language works.

If r/exmormon was a community of impartial observers with no preconceived notions or biases, then it would be objective. But it's not. It's a community of ex-Mormons, obviously. Literally the opposite! Literally! 

My point: to claim a viewpoint is objective just because you agree with it is disingenuous and intellectually dishonest. It's a small, trifling, intellectual dishonesty, and maybe you're cool with that and maybe you're not. I was just pointing it out. :) 




 you could hang out here, but it looks pretty dead:
http://www.reddit.com/r/nihilists 




 "For informed criticism of the Mormon church..."
"For insightful commentary on the Mormon church..."
"For ex-Mormons..."

I think those all work better. 




 well done. 




 Vectrex nostolgia, man.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vectrex 




 good on him 




 This is r/atheism's description of r/exmormon. Every time I see it it strikes me that an ex-mormon perspective is about as subjective a position as possible--objectivity suggests dispassionate third party observation.

Just something to consider. :) 




 Check out *I Love You Philip Morris*; its subject matter and distribution troubles largely relegated it to the indie crowd, but it's a great big crowd-pleasing comedy at heart. 




 just noting that it is by no means *the* best 20 films--awful lot of lists this time of year, ya know? 




 I would probably title this "*A* 20 Best Films of 2010," myself. 




 i'd be curious to know what you think, check back! 




 this has more to do with capitialism than christianity, but whatevs. 




 appreciate the comments--i was strictly editor on this, but you make some good points. i'll be sure to bring that to next project i'm behind camera. 














 i like this. 




 holy shit 




 King of Kong + some pretty solid TV work = cautious optimism 




 this is now linked from the WikiLeaks facebook page as well. 




 yeah, Deuteronomy 22. Quoting or referencing some specific verses would make it more effective though--confused rape victims might not be keen to read the chapter in its entirety, so some specifics would make your argument more accessible for them. 




 I came here to posit that 1975 feminist classic *Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles* is not engaging enough to be a viably political work. I think I may be lost. 




 Relevant Biblical citations would make this better. :) 




 Any relevant, honest, principled counter-cultural movement doesn't oppose the "mainstream" simply for its status as such, only implicitly to whatever extent "the mainstream" perpetuates what they oppose. As long as a work is intelligent and uncompromising, I don't care what percentage of the population approves of it--Exit Through the Gift Shop is largely that type of work. 




 1. Mark Kermode
2. Filmspotting
3. The /Filmcast

These three each have distinct outlooks--critic, academic, and nerd, respectively--that help give me a balanced perspective on the world of film. 




 You might be interested in Do The Right Thing by Spike Lee; wherever you fall politically, Lee is a filmmaker who often foregrounds his stylistic choices, making his films good candidates for this sort of analysis.

I'd also recommend the stylistically ostentatious and endlessly enjoyable works of Edgar Wright, though there's less likely to be much scholarly material available on him. 




 approval!

 it took me a bit, but i've made my peace with this syntax.

 . 




 guys, look, i'm not unaware of the Catholic authority hierarchy. I'm merely saying that Catholic culture and identity stretches beyond simple Vatican policy, and to declare someone uncatholic for her liberal understanding of the dogma is to misinterpret what being Catholic is in practice. Looking at the way Catholics live their lives in reality is a valid alternative understanding of Catholicism, and in my opinion a far more productive understanding than some purely theoretical Catholic ideal that's never happened. Honestly, I feel like my argument is being willfully misinterpreted at this point.
Also, good one on the 3/5. Catholics be sexist. :) 




 I agree that their behavior doesn't change Vatican policy, but the point I'm trying to make is that for many Catholics, there's more to Catholic culture and identity than that. 




 It is exactly what I'm talking about, actually. My point was that if for whatever reason a person identifies as Catholic, they are a small part of what Catholicism is. The word has no intrinsic meaning beyond what we give it, and people of the Catholic world have a right to the title whether they subscribe to the written dogma wholesale or not. I think you make a good case for what constitutes the Catholic belief system, but I think for many Catholics there is more to Catholic culture than that, and I certainly understand no wanting to give it all up. 




 I hear you, but the fact that you still call these people Catholics shows that their behavior defines what "Catholic" means, don't you think? For many Catholics, that means negotiating their personal beliefs with those of the institution, and I'd argue that this negotiation is a big part of the Catholic experience--they don't just sacrifice their right to the Catholic moniker by virtue of their nonpapality, right? 




 That's certainly one perspective, and it's perfectly defensible. For many people, however, the personal sense of community and identity that comes with Catholicism outweighs your subjective political reading of the situation, and that's fine. If her Catholicism has personal value for her, I respect that--especially if she's a good person. 




 I agree that hierarchy has historically been a big part of Catholicism, but I do think that the power these individuals hold comes down to a matter of perspective. Popes and Bishops are hugely influential within the institution, but they don't get to control the culture--that's controlled by the traits and behaviors of Catholic people, and is in my opinion a valid reading of what it means to be Catholic. 




 i knew very little about it when i first saw it, but the cinematography blew me right the fuck away. 




 Words do have meanings, and Catholics get to decide what Catholic means. I'm of the opinion that if you're raised in the Catholic world, you get one vote. The pope gets one, a priest gets one, and this woman gets one as much as anybody. I understand the temptation to externally define a rigid Catholicism; it makes for a compelling good and evil narrative. For many catholics, however, the label is as much a matter of identity and culture as belief.

Some people raised in the church want nothing to do with this label: they see Catholicism as an oppressive, outdated institution and they part ways decisively--it is for them inconceivable that one could don the Catholic title, as that would amount to an implicit endorsement of the Church's entire sordid history. I have nothing but respect for that line of thought and mode of action, but I have just as much respect for those who stay in the hope of making their institution better. Some people are born into the Catholic world, and through family, friends and culture, are indelibly a part of that community whether they agree with the party line or not.

If someone wants to maintain her Catholic heritage and title while fostering a more liberal morality and outlook, I say that's one legitimate vote for a less dogmatic Catholicism, and one small step toward a more rational and empathetic world, faith or not. If this disrupts a "good atheism vs. dogmatic Catholocism" debate, then good. Any atheism that only argues against strict dogma will have very little application in the real world; any non-traditional believer who begs a real-world argument can only elevate the dialog. 




 face the gymnists, book a hitman, pump up the volume 




 holy shit. 




 social sciences fiction? 




 I didn't vote--seize the day, brother! 




 "Most highly educated and professionals in America are white"
White people have more access to higher education, yes. There is a higher percentage of white people employed in stable middle class jobs, who are thus that much more suited to give middle class advantages to their children, yes. And as America perpetuates class divisions by continually affording more opportunities to those born and connected in privileged positions, this will continue to benefit whites and exclude blacks, yes. Thing is a) I don't exactly blame black people for this and b) this is far more an issue of class than race.

"Someone broke into your house?"
Yes, actually, someone really literally did--i live in a kind of shitty neighborhood. And it was a trashy white guy I knew as a kid, who ended up selling my laptop for drug money. But as a sane and rational individual, I don't assume that this is characteristic of white people. Again, this is far more an issue of class than race. Have you ever met a middle class black man who owns a gun and smokes crack? I haven't, but I know a fair number of lower class white guys who fit that description far better.

"Chicken or the egg, my friend, the chicken or the egg."
Well, except that there's an abundance of evidence for severe and violent American racism as the inciting factor here. Your accepted wisdom that blacks commit more crimes is rooted in that, which leads well-meaning but ignorant police to enforce the law on black people disproportionately until disenfranchised lower class black people no longer see white American law as a benefit to the community. We can see this in effect especially when we look at racial sentencing discrepancies and the shameful unreliability of cross-racial eyewitness testimony. I'm sure we don't disagree that racism happened in this country, and it was pretty severe--where we disagree apparently is that you think it's done and the onus is on blacks now, while I think the legacy of racism is shaping law enforcement behavior and cultural acceptance of stereotypes to this day--evidenced, quite frankly, in the fact that you take blackness as a given indicator of criminal intent. And I'm sorry, Fatties, but if that's not racism, what is?
I don't like these realities, but my method of affecting change is not strictly instructing black people to be better, it's to address a larger system that leaves a certain class--and by correlation, certain races--with limited options.  




 well we're entirely on the same page there. good talk. 




 i didn't mean to ignore it, and i think your assumption is probably justified: when people talk about disliking black people, it's reasonable to assume they're working with the same negative stereotypes you associate with the word "nigger." my only point was that the girlfriend's prejudice and the use of the word "nigger" are both based in the same ugly stereotypes, and that the connection is symptomatic of how we're conditioned to associate these things racially--and i do think that in keeping the label "nigger," we to some extent perpetuate that conception of racial stereotypes.

i hope i've not been inappropriately confrontational, by the way; i do understand that you're fundamentally arguing for evaluating people on their individual merits. your original post invited logical debate, and i'm glad you were up for it.

*edited promptly for spelling and grammar 




 right. but the fact that she said black people and you said nigger means that you made a connection. and of course you did: when we think of racism against black people, the word "nigger" is a big part of that history. but it's pretty disingenuous to pretend that word exists outside of its racist connotations and history, frmlol. i recognize your good intentions, but relegating fear of black to people to fear of "niggers" is not productive in breaking down harmful stereotypes; the fact that the stereotypes of "nigger" sprang to mind even though the word was never used is a testament to the strength of that detrimentally race-specific connection.

it's not that i "can't comrehend" the nature of language--and that's a bit of a condescending conjecture, darling--it's that communication is rooted in reception as much as intention. the word "nigger" has a history, frmlol, and whether one intends it or not, the word's reception is necessarily colored by specific racial subjugation and violence.

And if a white guy ran into grand central station yelling "nigger," the word would carry its history of race-specific violence even there. And whatever the guy was trying to express--probably craziness, as you say--he would be invoking a nasty set of stereotypes tied to a brutal and painful history. There might be some people who freak out like the straw man described above, but for my part, i'd just quietly think it was unwarranted and kind of trashy. And that's what I think pretty much every time I see or hear the word, frmlol.

*edited to include middle paragraph, i don't think your full post was available when i started the reply. 




 "I don't associate nigger, a negative term, with black people." I think that's where I and many others have trouble with this line of reasoning, frmlol. This poster's girlfriend did not say she fears "niggers," a word which has been continuously invoked in the comments here. She merely said she's afraid of black people. The fact that you're comfortable assuming she means "niggers"--your word, not hers--proves the association.

Ultimately, that's why these detrimental stereotypes continue to exist: because people make these racial associations whether they're conscious of it or not. 




 "it is normal for Whites"
what, niceness? you think most white people are nice? and everyone who's ever done something mean to you, those were all non-white people? you've never been mistreated by a white person? or, perhaps, maybe you're only race-conscious when non-whites are involved...

"however, the stereotypes usually aren't inaccurate and actually reflect reality."
people are more diverse within divisions than across them, fatties.

"Blacks commit more total crimes and proportionally more crimes than Whites, therefore people are more often to be afraid of Blacks than Whites."
Another fun reading of this is that black people get arrested more than whites, thus fostering a healthy, logical distrust of historically racist law enforcement and perpetuating a cycle that racist white people must ultimately answer for. 




 the word for that "attitude" is loaded with a history of racial subjugation, torture and murder. it is derived from the latin "niger" and spanish "negro," both of which literally mean "black." while i don't doubt your good intentions, use of the word "nigger" in this culture is inherently race-specific and only furthers the stereotypes this poster is trying to combat. 




 dtmfa. 




 perhaps quite insignificant in terms of the nation's spending, while extremely significant to NPR's continuation? Obviously? 




 bit on the nose, eh? 




 I do think that the original three Star Wars movies have pretty significantly different creative teams, which result in pretty different tone and style throughout. Do agree that those prequels are all the one color vison of Lucas though. 




 You are great! 80 is good! Yeah! I love you! 




 People who aren't Philip Seymore Hoffman in roles not played by him.

 It exists, and it has one reader. Awesome. 




 And more importantly, why the hell are they seeing mine? I really don't need the melodramatic song lyric I was quoting as a high school freshman shuffled into everyone's perception of who I am now. Who the fuck thought this was a good idea? 




 [*Synecdoche, New York*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9PzSNy3xj0) 




 Yup! 




 If this works reliably, it could be great. Big if though. 









 Yes. 









 The worst part is that I refuse to stop when it starts snowing again. Sweet sweet delusions. 




 You know what's cooler than a gagillion? A frafrillion. 




 Even though I'm worlds away from Synder on policy, I really did like the way he ran his campaign--hell, I still do. He wasn't peddling any of that socially backward anti-intellectual Republican bullshit, he was selling himself as a "tough nerd," playing up his intelligence and business savvy. While I was at odds with nearly every element of his platform, it felt like this was at last a noble conservative movement that I could engage with intellectually.

Now this shit. 




 Awesome, thanks! 




 Well, it seems as though we're both willing to be big supporters of somebody's movement--alas, I'm no politician. Too many compromising photos.

To be quite frank, I'm not much of a patriot either. Michigan is a beautiful state with a terrible government and an even worse economy. If it doesn't offer me a future, then I have the blessing of my family and friends to seek fulfillment elsewhere, just as I would wish for them. There's some sentimental regret in that, but so be it. 




 Fair enough. Give me a time and a place, 32koala--I'm based in Lansing and I'll show for a protest. I don't know that demonstration will hold much sway with an administration that doesn't recognize locally elected officials, and when nothing changes I'll be out, but I really am down to put in some good faith effort before cynically taking off as I fully expect to. 




 Yup, I have quite a few friends who were taken in by that "twelve point plan." He just didn't mention that Part 11 is taking emergency power and Part 12 is building the death star. 




 Exactly. Not scared, because I can leave. Pissed off because I'll have to. 




 This is one of those rare internet moments where somewhat perfectly articulates a widely applicable and wholly rational point of view that *had somehow never occurred to me before*. You have a small legacy in my worldview, Lochmon. 




 Wasn't familiar with that Ok Go track, but it's pretty sweet. Well done Rock Band. 




 awesome 









 It's true. I weave mounds and mounds of lame, lame bullshit, and then I gather all my friends around to congratulate me. There is merriment and feasting, laughter and song, and for one brief moment I feel... *human.* 




 No, Egodeath, I don't. I was trying to figure out why you were running an annoying joke predicated on your unsupported sense of superiority into the ground, and I figured that in the absence of any approval from those seeking discussion here, you might have a private audience of people who favor pointless snark over interpersonal engagement--turns out it's just you, super. I believe that's called "trolling," right?

Predicated: founded or based on. 




 Well hey, you genuinely expanded my perspective on post-modernism. I'll call that a good day for Reddit. 




 Oh sorry man--Explicated: made explicit. Didn't mean to go all verbose on you with that one word.

Actually, I hope that doesn't ruin all the fun you're having. When you gather your friends around the monitor to show them how cute you've been, they might raise their eyebrows at your characterization of my post as verbose--trs embarrassing. 




 Neofaust, I'll preface this comment by saying you're probably better versed in this stuff than I am and that I will likely cave under the slightest amount of pressure, but it doesn't make sense to me that post-modernism can somehow eschew definable "essence" and yet claim so many self-identified post-modernists--perhaps not so much in serious literature, mind you, but around the campus so to speak. Kids identify as "post-modernists," they're largely united around criticism of truth and obsession with constructs... couldn't we call that the movement?

Personally, I enjoyed the submission because I can relate to the author's frustration: I'm sick of arguing that logic is not only the best interpretation of reality, but it's a prerequisite of any arguments against itself. I think science should be a component of art and vice versa, and am sick of their increased "post-modern" segregation. I'm frustrated with the arguments I'm getting from my English department full of undergrads *calling* themselves post-modernists, so isn't indulging a parody of these trends somewhat justified?

I guess the question is--and maybe you can help me on this Neofaust--do I have a beef with post-modernism, or with "post-modernists?" I think I agree with you on what post-modernism *should* be--a transitional nebula of modernism criticisms--but it's being organized, revered, and evangelized by a certain social strata of trendy youngsters and it's irritating. And ultimately, I'm pretty sure that's what this Jenny Jones submission was about: this label is a source of pride and identity for many, and yet it's not much of a movement at all.  




 I mean, you can either choose to engage with the discussion or not, but calling it *lame,* perhaps literally the most shallowly trite of all possible dismissals, certainly looks like a defense mechanism. I'm not trying to psychoanalyze and I'm not saying I know anything about you or that *you* are shallow or whatnot, I'm just saying that I'd love to see your reservations better explicated. 




 Jesus. Yes. Thank you. 




 Comedy works when it addresses truth. If a joke is genuinely reinforcing misogyny or racism or other baseless bigotry, then it's not only unacceptable but probably not all that funny. If a joke is crafted to deal frankly and/or critically with the presence and absurdity of such hatred in society, then nothing is off limits.

EDIT: If any downvoters would like to engage with this hypothesis, it's a conversation I'd like to have. :) 




 pfff there are no muslims in their suburbs. :P 




 In all seriousness, i would pick up John Williams Rock Band in a heartbeat. 




 "The atheists are right about everything, actually."
Well, that fuels a few nasty stereotypes about r/atheism's self-perception. :P 




 This is a masterpiece of advertising, and should be taught in university classes. 




 Firth is legitimately great in it. Nothing else is. 




 Wasn't even nominated, actually. Bastards. 




 Does anyone have any insight as to how one might approximate that distinctly "film" look when using consumer grade HD digital--I'm thinking plugins and processing software, though shooting techniques are also welcome. Thoughts?

 I sure hope not. I happen to think that all of this lovely post-modern thought shoots itself in the brain and dies when it divorces philosophy from the real and rational. 




 When I say I respect someone's opinion, I'm generally saying that the logic of their opinion is at least least internally consistent, even if I might disagree with the likelihood/ethics of their premises. 




 *Portal 2*, my PC sucks and I don't have a next-gen. A port would make my day.

 He's not taken seriously in the sciences, but he's been quite influential in the arts. Much to my chagrin. 




 Like how all non-believers are just looking for excuses to sin. Cool story Freud. 




 OP is a jackass. 




 This is where Ebert really shines for me. When he's talking about general releases, I'm with him about half the time. When it comes to recognizing greatness, I'm on board 100%. 




 I think perhaps--and I truly intend no offense here--you might just be bad at rhythm games. :P 




 Yes, I am aware of all of those things. And they're all much more relevant points to make on a film board than an appeal to feeding the children. :P 

I guess I'm not defending the Oscars so much as I'm defending the place of art and entertainment even in the presence of suffering. David Fincher could drop everything and work in a soup kitchen--so could we--but I'd prefer that he keep making movies. 




 ... what are you doing at the Film subreddit, and why are you not volunteering at Red Cross right now? 




 Not to mention [this](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1315981/). 




 I'd just like to say that these posts are so much more compelling to me than memes and facebook images. Great personal story, best of luck to you and your family. 




 LOOK IT'S LIKE A DICK FULL OF JIZZ!!!

That's the joke I would have gone with, myself.

 I just figured there were a lot of Hawking fans around here. 









 "Universal Acclaim" 














 So there's a bunch of religious bullshit on your floor, and somebody didn't like your noodle poster. The humanity. 




 Well, I did my part for democracy today. 














 Also honest, I think it's amazing. It punches me in the face and makes me want to live and fall and love and build things and fail and hug everything. 




 I have no idea what you're talking about. 




 ... my brain? 









 Yes darling, I read it. The writer is saying that beyond objectively appreciable gameplay elements, Dead Space 2 transcends the sum of its parts to succeed as an engaging work of game art, thus necessitating acknowledgement of the critic's subjective position. Accepting that the game works on that level and was presumably intended to, the author clearly states his intention to address the game primarily in terms of impact, as is common practice in film and literary criticism. The author chooses to do so in his own voice: this likely precludes the review from consideration for traditional print journalism as it ignores established journalistic conventions--the ignorance willful and the conventions largely arbitrary, mind you--but it's perfectly suited to the author's intent. The more one explores a variety of authorial styles through criticism of multiple media, the less strange this choice will seem. Ya snob. 




 It is a "comment" on the sudden wave of uninformed writing criticism, one I felt would work best in the same format as the trend I was addressing: a submission about writing. 




 (before edit) This really has nothing to do with gaming.

Well, it has about as much to do with gaming as the line by line red pen critiques popping up. It's more to do with the nature of game criticism, and that seems to be hot right now.

As for the propriety of posting it as its own submission, I think this perspective merits as much space as the condescending review edits. 




 Yes, middle schoolers use a bunch of "I" statements and acknowledge themselves as writers. And then you get to high school and they tell you not to. And then you become an adult and you write in your own damn voice.

Yes, that seems strange to high schoolers. Clearly. But acknowledging one's subjective position and focusing on impact over summary doth not bad criticism make. 




 I don't think that Cartesian skepticism necessarily endorses the cognitive *over* the physical, it merely accepts consciousness as our necessary starting point. The existence of the doubter could just as easily be physical as metaphysical; the main point is the potentially physical but quite definitely subjective nature of the mind. 




 Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww 




 Good and evil are human constructs, but they're real and valuable constructs nonetheless. 




 the trick is... is that conclusion false? 




 Love is blind, God is love, God is blind. 




 I'm not sure that that holds up--eat is a much different verb from is.

All wolves *are* deer-eaters and all deer *are* grass eaters is a rewording of your submission according to the rules of the premise, and as you can see there are no two terms in common there. 




  Bitches

Pointless misogyny does your question a disservice, bro. 




 Personally, I think the worst critics are the neutral, predictable, boring ones. White's a lot of things, but at least he's none of that. 




 Hey, as long as he's handsome, British, and smooth as hell then that's what counts. Contemporary Britain isn't strictly white, and Bond needn't be either. 




 Oh I hope so as well 




 Fantastic selection, thank you! 




 awesome, thanks! 




 I actually just subscribed to this! It's pretty great, but it's awfully short. 




 I'm a bus rider, long walker, and student janitor; I need some decent philosophical discussion to pump into my head. What's your pick for best philosophical podcast? 




 Ricky Gervais is the Animal Collective, specifically. And I happen to think he's a bit pretentious. 




 This was exceptionally well shot! 




 Assuming sympathy for both of them, this is one of the more beautifully sad sentiments I've seen on reddit. 




 Hey, a reasoned case with examples from the film instead of a blanket statement about critical consensus! I support this.

 There's a difference between between denying absolute morality and denying all morality. If you have any personal, subjective moral positions then use those in conversation--that's what morality conversations are for anyway.

If you literally have no morality whatsoever, then their assessment of your psychopathy is correct, so just roll with that. 




 Perhaps [Jetpac](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jetpac), according to [IGN](http://ign64.ign.com/articles/072/072404p1.html). 




 Eh. Looks like a bunch of borderline-nihilistic destruction; mostly leaves me kind of depressed.

 Just don't bother any more, Cult Movies, you'll never top this. 




 Damn, your school's got a sexy paper! 




 the solipsismic quandary of the quadruply meta masturbator. 




 Yeah, I came here to bitch about how this sort of thing isn't going to further sensible dialog in any way.

Then I looked at the picture, and it's pretty uncanny. I even got an awkward shock chuckle out of it. 




 ... that makes absolutely no sense. 




 I'm realistically compassionate for him. Anyone who thinks this matter will be settled with an execution is ignoring the real problem, that we do need better mental health awareness and destigmatized care for those suffering.

That said, he committed a heinous crime and deserves trial and sentencing. His mind is broken, yes, but he is his mind and deserves to be held accountable.  




 I feel like people aren't talking about this film's style enough. I'm a big fan of how the film marries the first-person subjectivity of the camera to the borderline omniscience of the internet; there's a lot of potential for narrative innovation in that pairing, and I think it's something we're going to see more of in the future. 




 Fun Fact: this was the first standup concert film ever to play Sundance. There's not too much going on stylistically, but it's definitely a movie. 




 YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
