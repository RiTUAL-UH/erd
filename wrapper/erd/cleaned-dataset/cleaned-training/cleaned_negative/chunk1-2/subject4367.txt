 well, yeah. I lurk on reddit but never really had the urge to post anything till I had this. Apologies if this is against "Reddiquette." It wasn't my intention. 




 Thanks. We know Clones is shit and just wanted to see if there was any way to make it better! I think "kinda cool" means it's a success! 









 That would be pretty awesome.
If you are interested, We will be releasing a 90ish minut rewritten/rescored edit of the prequels with some Jango Fett sequences that may quench your thirst.

 




 Thanks alot! And yeah, I'd say that's a reasonable assumption.  




 Thanks!

 I want to see Coruscant having been left in a state of decay after decades of totalitarianism.

 Why have you only gotten nude in Deadwood? 
























 Yes, From Scorsese's Last Temptation Of Christ

 Sorry about that, I think it is an issue with the Kavinsky track that's used. YouTube apparently doesn't want certain people to see it.
If anyone has any tricks to get around that type of thing, I'd be interested. 




 Definitely!
If you want, I'll try to shoot you a PM when we upload it.
It should be soon. 




 2006 2-disc special edition dvds include these as a special feature. They don't look too pretty though.
 




 Thanks!
This is actually a clip from a larger prequel edit.
(all 3 Movies are down to one 90ish minute film with a different score and plot.)
I tried to choose the best beats to cut to but some (like that one) may have gotten away.
