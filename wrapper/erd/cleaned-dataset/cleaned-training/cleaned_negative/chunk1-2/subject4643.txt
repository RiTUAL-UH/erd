 After seeing that EA has taken a huge leap from fifa 14 to fifa 15 and having stepped up the franchise quality (no sarcasm).... Isn't it time for ubisoft to try and make a sports game ?? Maybe not something like fifa but maybe some sort of Galactic Football-ish game ?? And offer some competition to EA ??

 They just need to stop milking the fuck outta transformers.It had the worst plot and writing .... Michael Bay decided to cheap out the first one hour so he could blow everything in the last 30 minutes of the movie..the plot had so many holes that can't be filled even in an extended version of the movie.... and well the remainder of the movie was just ad placements.. 




 The Oreo transformer was the best...hands down !! 




 How about starting a firm with disgruntled employees with huge experience ??

 Did anyone else notice the text written  on the sticker of the old aquarium or some tank when Bryan Cranston and his son return to retrieve floppy disks from their old house ? I am sure that was sticker with [Mothra] written on it.
It appears just after the enter the house. 














 My best guess is what has happened in real life updates in the dream..the recurrung dreams seem like the longest i've had and the most surreal 




 Most original joke which made you laugh hard?? 














 I have lost all my hopes on the new games due to the constant Dlc's spam and unpolished gameplay...maybe one day we will get an AoE sequel... or not.So,which games do you think need a reboot or a sequel ?? 














 The title speaks for itself. 









 I hope most of the people have seen Captain America 2 and have seen steve rogers maintain a "To Do" list.Here it  is - http://i.imgur.com/1u1p4Go.jpg?1....So the question is what would you guys would suggest he should add to his "To Do" list if he met you in your real life ????

 Senior animal trainer Mike Alexander and a team of four experts spent a total of 19 weeks preparing the critters for their film debut. Once the animals became accustomed to sitting with the trainers (each squirrel was trained one-on-one), they were taught to pick up a nut and place it in a metal bowl. The bowl was eventually replaced by a conveyor belt for the film.

 Maybe he was a perfectionist, or maybe he wanted to cut costs . The one guy who played the dwarf was paid 1 million dollars (thats right). Which may or may not be cheaper than hiring 100 of actors and applying make up on them. 




 Well, in an era when Star Trek and Star Wars were pretty famous ... im pretty sure people would have watched this too and grow a liking 









 It's a live action movie adapted from manga. 




 I think Two Faces Of January is one of his best films. It also has a great performance from Oscar Isaac.

I hope you guys like it . 


































 You know its a great game when people talk about it even 3 years later 









 The Question mark is confusing me . 














 Works just fine :D 









 *while playing LoL* 




 AND SOME OTHER THINGS. 




 **THIS.** 




 Zero hope is bit of an overstatement. Look at Nic Cage for example. Although having a shitty year, he has given a great performance in Joe ... which is a good movie IMO. 



















 L.A Confidential . 









 That's the third part . I have only watched the first and second. They were pretty good IMO . 




 [Here](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2072230/?ref_=nv_sr_2) 




 Well , Rurouni Kenshin turned out pretty good . So lets hope this does too . 



















  A good bash always fixes everything.

 You really want to play Bronson , don't ya ?? 




 What a day , *what a lovely day* . 









 Am i the only one who liked Two Faces Of January or is it really that bad ??

Probably would land a #12 or #13 spot IMO. 




 So , remake of Man on Wire ?? 




 YES !! 









 Let's be optimistic. 




 Why wouldn't he ??

 OP has relevant username. 




 This seems like a reasonable explanation. 




 Quality is what matters more than anything . TWD seems to be going downhill on quality everyday IMO. 




 annoying and unnecessary (i mean the mid season breaks) 




 What do you guys think about these current tv shows making a habit of running mid season finales ?? Shows like "The Walking Dead" and "The Flash" seem to follow this. 









 Gotta agree with you.
 









 Does real life run on 15 fps ??

 Try harder pls. 




 *Extreme Gaming*... Surely lives up to it's name. 




 Up voting for awareness. 




 No, he ain't 














 Skyfall nearly edges Casino Royale as the better movie. 




 It's a pretty bad poster but ,  it's got Samuel.L.Jackson and Colin Firth so it might be a pretty good popcorn flick. 




 This comment would either get down-voted to oblivion in other threads or either stand glorious like you.

 I think it is one of the best and most ambitious sci-fi movie of it's time.I loved the movie.The ending was perfect.It was more like a ending after the ending,which i liked.

If contact would have been made now ... it would have been a smash hit.
