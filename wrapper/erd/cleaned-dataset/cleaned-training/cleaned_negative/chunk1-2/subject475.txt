 I buy crappy, $8 knock-off-Toms shoes from a pharmacy I work next to and they work better than any other brand I've ever had, including Sketchers.

Of course every four months or so they completely fall apart, but then I just have to spend $8 versus $40 like I did when I bought Sketches (that also fell apart after four months). 

I work in a store with carpet, though, so it might be a little different. 




 I've had so many bad ones (including some guy LITERALLY screaming in my face until I cried because his computer wasn't ready; I was a cashier at the time), but I'll pick a good one.

I was out to dinner next door to my store after work, just by myself, and the waiter came up to me and said that the couple across the restaurant wanted to pay for my meal. They were regular customers and hugged me and said how great I was. I will honestly never forget that. 




 Your managers are dumb. Fighting with those people is one of my favorite things, I'd never give in to them. MAYBE on Staples coupons just to avoid a complaint, but never on manufacturers.  




 I got an 2 TB external hard drive for $19 once (usually $90). Also a bunch of 8gb flash drives for .50 each. And a book case for $8. 

There's a desk in our warehouse, usually $100, now $9 that I might grab.  




 I've been the full-time team supervisor since the position rolled out.

I like the position, tbh. I am consistently running around, probably doing the jobs of two people, and getting paid way too little. BUT, if I hated it, I wouldn't be there. My associates like me as a manager because I've never gone on ~power trips. BUT, my first part-time counterpart DID and everyone hated him. And I think that's probably common because normal people with lots of manager experience and a good work ethic don't really want to work for 11-12 dollars an hour. 

As a whole, I think the position is a good idea at some stores (like mine, tier 4, 12-13 employees). At higher volume stores with more employees, I think eliminating the assistant position for two team supervisors is a stupid idea. It's just not enough.  




 I'm not in Seattle but I'm in the same district and... I wouldn't count on it. 

 




 Not at my store, surprisingly. 

I'm sorry, that's really dumb. It sounds horrible.  




 Yeah, unfortunately as a full time Team Supervisor, you HAVE TO have open availability. I'm pretty sure it's listed as a requirement in the qualifications. :(

I think it's different for other positions because (at least at my store) the full time team supervisor is more integral than any other position.  




 Yep. Super annoying. I stopped handing them out, unless it's for one of those customers that takes like 30 seconds to gather their stuff. 

When there's three entries, AND THEN the $30 off $90 or $10 off $50 it feels like an eternity. Earlier I had to move to another register while it was printing. Ridiculous. 




 One time I had a customer who loaded up her entire cart with desk accessories, notebooks, pens, just random stuff. It ended up being around $400 and 10 bags of stuff. When she went to pay she was like "wait, this is Office Depot, right?" And I was like "...no, this is Staples" and she freaked out and said "I'M ONLY AUTHORIZED TO PURCHASE FROM OFFICE DEPOT! I THOUGHT THIS WAS OFFICE DEPOT!"

All I could do was shake my head. And put all of her stuff back. 




 Yep. Whenever a customer says "Hey you should really change that! Let your higher ups know!" I always say "You'd have better luck than me! Call this number!" and I hand them the presidents line card.  




 32 cent raise.  




 I only get points from my GM, and I won some random contest for being recognized and got 20 points.

The CPC people at my store are drowning in points, it's ridiculous. I was talking to one guy and he was like "yeah I think I only have 450 right now".

I have 130 and I've never used any. But being a Team Supervisor doesn't really give me the opportunity to earn a lot -- I don't sell tech and I probably ring up 50 people a week.  
























 I'm sure John Mulaney is hilarious, but the writing on this show seems horrible. 

"I have a feeling I'll never get booked on Letterman?"
"What'd the booker say?"
"You'll never get booked on Letterman"

Cue the laugh track and me turning the channel.  




 I think the world will finally know peace when Netflix decides to add all of the original Law and Order episodes. 

Briscoe/Curtis/McCoy 4 life. 




 How to Get Away With Murder was definitely my favorite pilot. Shonda strikes again.

I've also (kind of) been enjoying Red Band Society. Hoping the coma kid wakes up or dies, though, or they just eliminate the annoying narration. I see it getting canceled, though.

And Black-ish is good, too.  




 I caught a girl stealing headphones and a bunch of other stupid stuff once. I followed her into the bathroom, she got startled and dropped all the packaging. I said "did you pay for that?" She said yes. I asked for her receipt, she said she threw it away. I said "okay, well let's go look it up." She got all cocky and said okay. Halfway to the register I said if I couldn't find it I was calling the cops. She backed down, opened her bag, and handed me all the stuff. This girl was like 13. 

I've caught plenty of meth-heads stealing pens and velcro, but the little girl with the Hello Kitty headphones is still my best thief story. 




 Customer comes in with a printed page "so you carry this, where might I find it?" It's a popcorn maker or a treadmill or something equally ridiculous. "I'm sorry ma'am/sir, that's an online only item"... " No it isn't"... "Yes it is... it says 'online only' right there"... "Well can you call another store?"... "It's online only, meaning you can only order it from our website"... "Can you just check?"... "..." 




 We both just got our asses handed to us by our GM. Our DM wanted someone to be held responsible (aka fired) but we were both to blame so it just got forgotten about.

Anytime some idiot cashier puts ink out without a box now I'm all over it. I found a $24.99 Epson 200 tricolor pack with no box earlier and I freaked haha, I don't think the paranoia will go away as long as I'm at Staples. 




 I have no idea honestly. The Epson one happened on a really busy day where it was just me and two other people. I think someone just came in with an open duffle bag, grabbed the ink and walked out. It would have probably only taken a minute or two and I'm sure the person planned it. We don't have cameras or anything so who knows.

The Canon one happened on a morning pretty close to when the Epson thing happened, so I'm sure it was the same people. I'm pretty sure I came close to being fired for the Epson theft. If there wasn't another MOD there I'm sure I would have been. 




 A year or so ago someone jacked literally all of our Epson ink, like $5000 worth. So we started alpha boxing all of it. Then the same thing happened with our Canon ink (not $5000, maybe $500) so we started alpha boxing all of that, too.

Now everything is boxed, except Kodak, because no one likes Kodak. 




 I probably watch three movies I've never seen a month, sometimes more. This WEEK I've watched five or six but I probably won't watch any more for a few weeks. 

Every year I set a goal to watch 150 movies I've never seen, and I do really good for like a month. And then I stop completely. 




 I watched The Rock for the first time today. Pretty good, actually. Nicolas Cage and Sean Connery are hilarious. 

"How in the name of ZEUS' BUTTHOLE did you get out of your cell?" 




 The other day a guy brought back a shredder. I heard him say to my tech associate "yeah I just want to swap it out". He didn't have a receipt so he needed me to look it up. I asked when he bought it he said "oh, I don't know, maybe six months ago?" 

I was just like "... no, we can't do that. Our return policy is 14 days." He was just like "I'll remember that next time I decide to shop here." 

Also had someone wanting to return a laptop after a year because it was running slow. I asked if he bought the extended warranty, he asked "no, why would I do that?" He started yelling when I denied it and I said "every retail location has a similar return policy, I don't really know what to say" and he flipped out.

We also get tons of non-receipted return requests. Oh yeah, I totally believe you bought three of the same $50 daytimers, two pairs of the same headphones, a Mophie case and a $100 Kenneth Cole backpack. It's gotten to the point where I just say "nice try, but no." 




 Awesome job! 




 I think my store's budget is like, $2200 or something. Any store in my district that sells over $3K consistently gets a tech bench, but I think we've hit $3K like... once ever and that was a year and a half ago. We usually hit $1000-$1500 lately. BUT, for the last year we've had like, 1.5 techs (.5 because usually weekends are all they can work) and no SSM. 

We usually hit 6% ESP, sometimes higher sometimes lower (this past week it was like... 1.7% or something equally fucking awful, but the week before it was 8%) Goal is 7% but 6% is acceptable.

Talking to customers is the main thing, I think. I do pretty shitty with sales when I'm like "buy the fucking Dell and get out of my face." But when I'm like "hey how's it going, what are you using this for, oh I have a sister named Alice, too, yeah the parade was really cool, oh Big Brother is great this season, blah blah" people are way more likely to buy Squaretrade, Office, Total Support, etc. 

Anytime you see anyone over 50 heading into the laptop/tablet section, grab them. Old people are your key demographic because 99% of the time they don't know what the hell they're doing. Mention viruses and you're in. 

And you gotta be pretty shady. When my store had a TCE (long, long ago) a customer brought in their computer because they're screen was flipped upside down. Now we all know this can be fixed by pressing a few buttons. My TCE charged this poor old lady the full diagnostic fee. As soon as she was out the door he pressed the buttons and it was fixed. He called her the next day and made up some bullshit.
