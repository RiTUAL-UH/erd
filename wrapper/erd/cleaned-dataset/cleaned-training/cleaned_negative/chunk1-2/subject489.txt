 They already Annonced an Update which looked pretty good   




 i had the same issue. went to the apple store, they told me my battery was broken and replaced it  




 Rewe hat die  














 Taxes are between 20 and 50 percent, so the 10% church tax on this is about 2-5% on the total income 




 10% of your tax, which is like 3-5% of your income

Edit: grammar 




 no 




 Maybe low battery? 




 So, with all of those bugs in the gm that we can see in this subreddit.. Do you think this will be the final version? Or is apple going to patch the stuff before the release? I'm not sure about how "final" the GM is ..  




 And 18 upvotes already, things are really going well for you right now! 




 can you post your background? it's pretty nice 




 Holy Shit, the last scene was incredible ! 




 I just love how it looks on videos, and i cant wait to see it live on mine :)  




 Is it only me or does the black stuff look like a penis ? :o  




 actually had to laugh pretty hard :D not sure if so good or so bad :x  









 does anybody know why the background is so pixelated? looks like the quality of apples filter is pretty bad. or is it just imgur?  
























 looks like a healthy relationship 




 what advice did it give you? 




 you should probably add what youre talking about 




 well if it helps  




 am i the only one who could always avoid this kind of situations? 




 someone's jelly over here 




 so awkward 




 So this was just random? 




 Sorry english is not my first language..

I just wanted to say that they are showing how the iPhone has the feature which samsung was advertising strongly on their S5 and apple is just showing that it is also possible with the iPhone without even mentioning it directly.. Its not an attack (couldnt find another word) they're just making fun of them 




 It's just a small thing I noticed, but I think you guys might like it. In the new iPhone 5s "Powerful" commercial you can see how some guy is using his iPhone to measure his pulse with just the flashlight and the camera (there are tons of apps for this) which is clearly a little attack towards Samsungs new Heartbeat Monitor

 yay we are as good as the us 




 yeah but why cant i just watch them in my photos app?

 They have 3 Million iPhone 5c left.. 




 So what youre saying is "i can't tell what i want, but others also can't"? 




 As I said, those things have been proven wrong, thats not just my opinion (Look here: http://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/ttugs/i_was_in_the_library_the_other_day_and_i/c4psdtb)

It is also surprisingly that all of the people asking about the goal of feminism are feminists. (The posts linked to in the sidebar) so most of you guys dont even know what you are fighting for? 




 Most of those discussions are leading to one single post, which is proven wrong by different people in the same threads.
 




 So, I'm just wondering .. what would you feminists consider a perfectly fine social world? When is your "movement" done? What is the ideal situation to live in? I'm just curious about your mission and whether you have a goal.  




 thats not making any sense at all 




 LeBlanc shits on him
