  It really isn't the entire 1% that's the issue. It's the 1% of the 1%.

It's more of a philosophical issue, rather than an actual practical issue. The .01% should probably pay more taxes. However, the rate that they pay on average as a whole is still substantial. And their 'lack' of taxation does not negatively effect the middle class and lower class. It's not like we raise the tax on the poor when the rich don't pay enough. 

It doesn't feel right - sure. But overall it shouldn't even be a top 10 issue in this country. However since it is an emotional appeal (appealing to anger, jealousy, resentment, and ignorance), it works well for politicians and pundits to dwell on the relative non-issue.

.01% btw is 30,000 people. Not to mention that these are the type of people who would just leave the country if they started to get taxed more (or at least take 90% of their assets to another country).  




 Private colleges? Republican owned? Public school tuition is just as big, if not more of a problem. Big state schools now cost almost $30k to attend. Leave the political Republican hating nonsense at the door. This isn't /r/politics.

Irony you attack the bias/quality of the article, when you are clearly just as biased and ignorant. 




 Wtf is wrong with this thread... 




 Yea I think using a try catch might be the best option. Thanks. Sometimes I just can't get the obvious stuff. I'm doing the poker problem on euler. 




 I have a method where I am passing an index of an array as a parameter. I then want to use that index (int value) to loop through the rest of the array. However the first line of the method is like this:

     public int hasTwoPair(int index) {
         if (cards[index].getValue() == cards[index + 1].getValue()) {
         //problem because index + 1 might be out of bounds

is there a way around this without adding an extra 'if' statement? 
 




 Considering administrators are the highest paid staff in any given school system, this is probably a good thing. Wish we would seriously evaluate the usefulness of so much administration overhead.

     for (int i = 0; i  100; i++) 
        System.out.println((i-100) * -1);
    }

You can do this with an incremental or decremental (thats not a word?) loop.

EDIT: but if you want to use a decremental loop, it looks a little cleaner:

    for (int i = 0; i  -100; i--) {
        System.out.println(i+100);
    } 




 Interesting. Thanks! Pretty hard to find a good review of these limited editions when they come out. 




 Upvoted for the title. 




 Sure you get 5%, but you end up paying a 2.5% purchase fee - so at that rate, you are paying a 25x higher rate than the Amex cards I posted. 

9000 pts would cost $9 with this discount.

9000 pts with VCG purchase would cost $45-$50 in purchase fees (I can't remember if it is $4.95 or $5.95 purchase fee for the $200 gift cards).

You save $36-$41 with this discount. Per 9000 points. And you don't have to make 5 trips to Staples/Officemax.  




  He's absolutely loyal to his constituents, and a great voice for the Hispanic Community (Little Village in particular), as well as the Teacher's Union who essentially drafted him to run. Those constituents stand to gain the most if he's elected.

 Well lets say you are already maxing out your Redbird - is this worth it if you cash it out some other way? Not sure how. Maybe they can be used on Evolve and not get charged any fees? 




 Not sure, that's kind of my question.  









 The article is not talking about SNAP. The new proposed law does not effect SNAP at all (and it's not like you can use SNAP at the movie theater), so I'm not sure why you are talking about foodstamps. 




 So it has an overall economic benefit, but that doesn't mean it's good for them - and that's who we are trying to help, right? 




 The problem is there are people who will still drive 55-60mph. They will end up causing accidents. 




  There is no way Fox is more biased than MSNBC

Did you mistype? 'lol no, show me the link' - you can't use Google yourself?

Anywhere you can read [here](http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2013/12/is-msnbc-worse-than-fox-news-179175.html) 
or [here](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbercovici/2013/03/18/pew-study-finds-msnbc-the-most-opinionated-cable-news-channel-by-far/)

They might be both quoting the same study.

A quote - "But here's the thing, and I hope it doesn't ruin your dinner: MSNBC is certainly as bad as Fox News, in terms of presenting ideologically biased information and demonizing the opposition."

[one more](http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2012-11-02/entertainment/bal-pew-study-suggests-msnbc-really-is-more-partisan-than-fox-20121102_1_pew-study-msnbc-fox-news) that shows how much more MSNBC was biased during the Presidential election. 




 Reporting integrity and bias. Lesser of two evils when it comes to Fox, but MSNBC even more biased than Fox. You can Google it. 




 You are comparing FOX to what exactly? Fox should be compared to MSNBC. And in that case, Fox comes out on top. 




 What about Senator Warren who got into Harvard because she marked down that she was Native American? I guess NYT doesn't care about that... 




 So when I do that. it puts a cursor everywhere in my file (what is Alt+Enter anyway?). not just that one string. 




  Hit right and enter to give them each a line

Not sure how this works. You mean hit right on my keyboard? Doesn't seem to do much. 




 You should put this on /r/learnprogramming. A lot of readers there might not even know about ST 




 Oh ok, I avoided it since it's Beta, but maybe I'll upgrade.  




 How did you put a cursor between each character? Did you do that manually? I know in Windows you can just ctrl + left click to add a new cursor - but that would seem annoying for so many cursors. 




 Wow. I just downloaded Sublime Text 2 recently, and so far I really like it. It might be worth the money. 




 Why is this in /r/shittyprogramming? THIS IS BRILLIANT!! 




 It was pretty easy in college as long as you have an internship or two - or some really good side work. 




 You need to look up the String split function. Google something like "Java String split method".

 Who says they hate gay people? They didn't say "we won't serve gay people", they said, "we won't serve at gay weddings". Gays are more than welcome to come in and buy pizza. Doesn't sound like hate to me. 




 From what I understand, you could buy gift cards to the flight. Also keep in mind this goes towards flight changes and other fees. I had to pay $75 to change a flight, and Amex covered it. Also drinks on the airplane would count for this as well.

Also bear in mind that you can downgrade to a Amex Green card. You can get your points, downgrade, and get a pro-rated amount back. You might end up only paying $140 for the annual fee, but still get the bonus. Not to mention you also get TSA Pre for free as well ($100), plus free in flight wifi and Boingo at airports, and Priority Pass Select (free lounges!). 




 I did. On the highway. It was quite scary. 




 I received this offer, and I took it. The benefits that Amex gives you are worth quite a lot. I saved a lot of money on checked baggage and upgrading to economy plus.

I haven't used the points yet, so they are still sitting in my account. Was going to fly to Israel with my wife, but she is due with a baby at the same time we wanted to go, so we will have to wait.

Also my offer was for spending $15k total, *not* $20k. 




 Eh no one? Could use some help on the PL/SQL side.  




 Can I execute PL/SQL in Tableau?

I basically need to write some PLSQL that returns a table, and pass that table to Tableau. I am copying my problem here:

I am trying to do a query where I combine entries from the same table, but from different schemas. I can do a query to find which schemas in my DB I need to look at.
I'm kind of new to PLSQL, so I'm not sure how to go about doing this. It would look something like this:

Loop (over v_schema)

   select * into myView from

   v_schema.myTableIneed

end loop

so in the end, 'myView' will have the the entries from the table myTableIneed, from multiple schemas.
The other issue, is that there is a chance that the table might not exist in every schema. That's ok, so I would need to handle that exception.
Something like that. I guess I'm not sure how to properly loop, or how I get the list of schemas into the 'v_schemas' variable.

Someone suggested that I use cursors with a procedure. However that might not help me, as I don't think calling a procedure from Tableau could work. I think what I need is an executable block of PLSQL. Please advise.

 Also to note, make sure you don't use your own credit card with your name on it. That will get you flagged. Use an AU or a spouse's card. 

Also Square is helpful for accepting payments when selling on Craigslist. I've even benefited by charging 3% extra to use a credit card (when selling on Craigslist) - so I end up making more money, even with the fees. 









 And rational normal liberals also still vote for shit candidates. So what's the difference? 




 ? Umm the gravity of the moon... I'm not sure I understand your joke/statement/sarcasm? 




 Yea but I think some cases of refusing service are legitimate. For example if you are a web developer - and you are asked to make the website 'TheBibleIsAllLies.com" - i think that it's fair to refuse to do this service as it directly goes against your beliefs. The problem is there is no way to distinguish between that and, "I won't serve you a burger cause you're a fag". 




   this was held up in court and created a psuedo R

Thanks for the info. Seems like the bill is too open. "I'm not going to serve you a burger cause your hair isn't covered" is a possibility. Although I think there is a bit of an overreaction as if there is going to be rampant baseless discrimination. Business aren't going to just start refusing all gay people service just because. It would yield too much of a backlash. Maybe I'm just not pessimistic enough 




 Can someone explain the actual problem with this bill? Like what does it say that would increase discrimination and allow people to be biggoted? I don't understand. Not sarcasm, I just don't know what the fuss is about. 




 I wouldn't touch a suzuki with a 10 foot pole. What pieces of shit.

 I didn't say no cell phones tv or computer. That's not what I said at all. First of all, I said no smartphones. I never said I wouldn't have a computer in my home. I also am not completely forbidding my kids from using/seeing such things. TV just will not be in my home. 




 As I mentioned in another comment, their peers will have parents who have similar viewpoints to myself. If I sent then to public school, then yes it would be quite problematic. 




 I posted on here a while back that I wanted to get some information from my fantasy league on ESPN.com. I spent some time learning some HTML and PHP basics and started trying to figure out how to post a login on [ESPN here](http://games.espn.go.com/frontpage)

I tried using the code from [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11171713/scrape-a-site-content-with-a-secure-login) StackOverflow post, but to no avail.

The problem I think is that the login is actually a popup (or is 'frame' the correct term here?). I'm not sure what to do here. Noob web developer here, so any help is appreciated.  




 My website has a title, a subtitle, and a picture. I like the way it looks on my browser. However on my mobile phone (Note 4), the text is not center adjusted, and is way too small. [Here](http://askyourlor.com) is the website.

 I work in Chicago, and I see a few people asking for money everyday. I really don't see anyone giving, and I think part of that is because very few people carry cash around nowadays. I can't remember the last time I even had change. It's kinda sad, and there isn't much we can do about it - or is there? 




 I committed, and pushed (although I inturrupted it eventually, i think most of the file was pushed) a 200 MB file. Since then, I reduced the size of the file to 2 MB, and comitted/pushed that change.

From what I understand, anytime someone clones (or do a pull for the first time since my change), they will have to download the entire file anyway - since it is part of the changeset.

How can I eliminate this large file entirely? Cloning now takes much longer.  









 So I was thinking that it might be difficult to get the gold Macbook a few weeks after its release. Why not buy a few and then resell them? Even if you resell at the same price, you can easily get a few thousand points. 

Thoughts? 









 In theory, I should be able to to CVS and buy a $500 Paypal load card for $502.95. I should then be able to load that money onto my paypal account. Then, I should be able to use my Paypal Business Debit Mastercard to pay my bills on EvolveMoney.com - without paying an extra fee (since it is a debit card from a large bank).

Can anyone confirm this? I just got my debit card and don't want to load my paypal account unless I know this works. 




 What is the difference here? A variable has to be public or private (correct?), and I think when you declare a class variable, and you don't specify public or private - then the default is public. 

So if I change my declaration from 'public static final String...' to 'static final String...', then is anything different?  




 I was so unbelievable disappointed that I missed the special edition cubania (strength 13). It sold out so quick. Can we make some sort of alert/sticky when it is available again? It's on Ebay, but it's double the price now. 




 I wanted to make my own website to further my career. I plan on using it for tech blogging, resume, projects I've done, to give me a greater 'presence', etc. 

Of course myname.com is taken ('myname' being my real name). So is firstname-lastname.com. However firstname-lastname.net is not taken. **Any reason I would not want to use the .net domain?** It's only $10 a year, and there is no strange spelling. 

This is in /r/cscareerquestions because this website is for the purpose of advancing my CS career down the line. 




 I started doing some PHP development (just started) on the side. I installed PHPStorm and a few other things. Is it ethical to be doing this on my work laptop? My job doesn't require any of these skills, it is purely for personal development. 














 They were going to have financials released yesterday but delayed. Not sure when they will be released. Looks like a good time to buy. 




 Tmobile will pay **up to** 1/2 of your phone when you upgrade. However, this is only after you have paid 1/2 of your phone.

Basically they are saying, "We will buy your phone off of you for 50% its original price, 1 year after you bought it".

The truth is, you can simply resell your phone for the same amount, if not more. All JUMP is providing you an easy way to sell your phone. That's all. Sounds pretty worthless to me, especially since my phone might be worth even more than they are giving me.

 Just trying to start learning PHP on my own. I got phpStorm - and I downloaded (and installed?) WampServer. I am looking at [this](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/php-101--pre-73284) tutorial. I get the error message "PHP Interpreter is not configured". What am I supposed to do? I just want to run PHP locally for the time being. What file is the interpreter?

Actually I just opened a command window and typed 'php' and it said command not found, so I must have done something wrong. 

I know this is super-noob. Would appreciate any help. I feel embarrassed to ask people I know how to do this.

EDIT: Haha I figured it out! Found the php.exe file and pointed to that, and voila! Cool stuff!  




 I got my gas bill this month, and it was more than half of my bill from Dec - Jan. I'm comparing both bills, and you can see [here: snapshot of both bills](http://i61.tinypic.com/e1dv81.jpg), there is an extra line in my last month's bill called 'supplier charges' for an extra $189. What is that from last month? Any ideas? 

Edit: tried calling earlier but got hung up now. At work and wanted to know if anyone had a similar issue. I have Spark Energy as a 3rd party provider (not sure how that works), but I didn't drop them or anything - and they shouldn't be charging me more than PeoplesGas. That's the whole point of switching to them.
 




 **My background:** I am a recent CS grad, currently working at a large company doing Java/SQL only (for the time being). I have spent most of my time with Java, but I am familiar with C as well. I dabbled in Python and Haskell as well. Sadly, I have absolutely ZERO experience in HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, or really anything having to do with web development.

Right now I want to create a webpage based on data that I would pull from my Fantasy Football league on ESPN's website. From what I know, there is no API available from ESPN to access this data. Furthermore, the data I need is specific to MY league - meaning I need to login into my ESPN account to get  this info. I want to take this info, do some simple algorithm, and then simply display a text box on a website.

My question is, what are my options for implementation? I would want to know what would be a way I can implement this, with or without Java. I'm open to learning something new, but I know so little about web development that I honestly don't even know where to start. 

EDIT: To explain what I want to do - I want to create an alternative ranking system for my league. What I would need to be doing is taking the total points scored by each team (each week) - and then run an algorithm to create a NEW ranking/point system. So where on ESPN's website, you might be ranked 3rd, on my ranking system you might be ranked 5th. In order to get this info, I need to access my league and see how many points each team has scored. ESPN's stats and news API is not helpful because I need to know how the teams in **MY** league scored. 

Second Edit: Thanks so much everyone! Looking forward to maybe trying more than 1 way to do this. Just telling me I need a 'scraper' helped. None of this ever came up in school, at all.

I am also fairly new to Reddit ( 2 months), so please be nice. if I made some sort of faux-pas 




 So I compared my Galaxy Note 4 (LOVE IT) to my wife's iphone 6 plus (thank heavens I don't have to look at that tiny 4 inch screen anymore), and I was a bit shocked at what I noticed.

When looking at something that is supposed to be white, for example, the background of Facebook, I found that my Note 4 is considerably less white. In fact, the parts of the screen that are supposed to be white, look more like 'off-white' or maybe even a slightly yellow tint. 

Has anyone compared their Note 4 to an iPhone 6 plus and noticed this? It made me quite sad. I'm hoping its a defect - although it's been 3 weeks since I bought the phone.

I read a lot of iPhone 6 plus vs. Galaxy Note 4 reviews, and no one mentions this.

Also to note, this is my first time using Reddit. If I have violated reddiquette in some way, please be nice - point it out, but don't get pretentious about it.  
























 Oh ok. Well I haven't tried it yet, but it seems the last 3 are kind of hard. And if you have been programming for less than a year, I wouldn't feel bad. The author of the article is a little pretentious.

 Welcome to Reddit, newbie :) 




  These are two different things.

That's my point... you lumped it together. And

 Long story short, I've been writing "apps" since a decade before they were called "apps" and long before you had pubic hair

And another way you make yourself look like a d-bag by rubber stamping your authority. It sounds like you are over-compensating for something. Someone with 15 years experience doesn't tell you they have 15 years of experience unless:

* Their experience came into question
* They are lying
* They are insecure and worried no one will take them seriously

It can't be the first option, because you mentioned your experience before we even began talking. You entered a conversation and jumped in with an irrelevant opinion, and bragging of your experience. You reek with artificial superiority.

But please tell me how you were doing X while I was doing something only a child does. That really makes you appear mature and above childish arguments. 




 Who the hell refers to iOS apps as 'web apps'? Web app implies an app through a browser. So anything that gets information from the web is a 'web app'? Well that's new! (sarcasm)

 Edit: They are called fucking Fig Newtons, I'm reading it off the box you idiot.

wtf?

And I like how you bragged and gloated "I'm the shit and know more than you (even though I didn't even ask what you know) and I've been doing this for 15 years" - when your rant wasn't even relevant, neither was your AMAZING experience in 'app' development. Like who gives a crap? We are talking about naming conventions of the OS versions. If you didn't come off like a pompous douchebag, I probably wouldn't have said anything. 

At least I don't claim to know everything. I simply attacked your statements. At no point did I say, "I know more than you" or did I say I have "x years of experience and I am and expert in the field". You put yourself on a pedestal, so I tried to knock you on your pretentious ass. Maybe if you were more clear wtf you meant the first time around (and weren't a complete tool), then we wouldn't be here right now. 




 Opinion? Can you please tell me what web apps are coded in Objective C or Swift? Most web apps aren't even written nowadays in Java anyway (even though you could).

Either way you were complaining about *Android*, which has nothing to do with web apps or web sites. 

I Googled nothing. And again, your rant is irrelevant and seems to show your ignorance and blatant Android hating based on nothing. 

Have you ever even written an Android app? Sounds like you have not, which makes your rant really stupid. I say you have not written an Android app because you said:

 I've written websites and web apps for 15 years

As if that somehow makes you qualified to give an opinion on coding Android or iOS.

And: WHO GIVES A CRAP?? 




 Yes I guess this is more of a "TIL something I should have known 3 years ago" 




 Dude no one gives a crap about your rant here... go complain on /r/shittyprogramming or something. 

 TL;DR ~ I've coded both. I've written websites and web apps for 15 years. I've written apps since before you even knew the word was associated with something other than that small meal you eat before your actual meal.

Um who was talking about 'both'? And what do websites and web apps have to do with Android and iOS (and who was talking about iOS anyway?)

Last I checked Android is written in Java, iOS in Obj-C/Swift - web apps are written in CSS/HTML/Javascript/PHP/C#/etc. So either you are full of crap or too lazy to actually say what you mean. 




 right 









 That's hilarious. So much so that I almost gilded you. 




  instead of just rolling over for public unions.

Except that's what they've done for decades, and that's why we are where we are. 




 For those who defend Chicago Teacher's salaries with the 'cost of living' - New York City teachers get paid about the same (slightly less actually) than Chicago teachers. **However, the cost of living in NYC is 50% higher than in Chicago**.

I'm calling BS on this 'cost of living' justification nonsense. 




  The cost of living is also above the national average. Relatively decent pay also prevents people from going to improved settings.

Not compared to other major cities where teachers make *less* money than Chicago, and their cost of living is *higher*. Chicago teachers have it **very well**, even the more so when accounting for cost of living. 

Example - cost of living is much higher in New York - yet they make less than Chicago teachers. In fact, if you account for living expenses, it makes Chicago salaries almost 50% higher than New York. 




 Because its not the CTA 




 I DECLARE SHENANIGANS 




 I agree 




 The article says the same thing - which means it's not giving us proper information. You cannot survive without water for 5 days. Period. So something is missing. I read the article and learned nothing new. My point stands.

 Tell you I'm pro-life, anti same-sex marriage, and of course, a Republican 




  Would you mind pointing out testimonials of people who went from zero to employed in 60 days? I can't wrap my mind around that, so I'd appreciate some narratives to guide me through that.

No no, 60 days is nuts. I have a friend I personally know who went to a bootcamp that took somewhere between 4-6 months. He then got an internship, and then got a job. It was a Ruby/rails bootcamp in Chicago. I'm trying to get the name of it. Will report back. 









 3 months even for 1 language is completely unrealistic. HTML/CSS/Javascript in 3 months? Possibly. Maybe. But doubtful. The boot camp that I know of is longer than three months, and seems to have good job placement. It's small and has a lot of individual attention.  




  And some bootcamps are worth 10x more than my CS degree

Well there are two years of garbage (humanities english history math you probably will never use, even in CS..). The other two years is a lot of concepts, and coding that you end up having to teach yourself anyway. 

My statement was a bit of an exaggeration, especially if we are talking about a 3 month program. 




 Why does everyone love Uub so much?  




 Except that long hair is not genetic... you either choose to cut your hair, or choose not to... 




 I always see a lot of anti-bootcampers here. I think we need to make sure we make that distinction that *some* bootcamps are complete garbage. And *some* bootcamps are worth 10x more than my CS degree. 

It's really not that complicated. Research your bootcamp before signing up. There are some really bad ones, and some really good ones. 

No need to argue here. 




 Got this cube the other day. It is just as awesome as I thought it would be. un-shapeshifting it isn't so hard. I got 5 out of 8 corners without a problem. The last two corners might be kind of difficult. It is really a great cube

 Haha I know, but the first link I found about sec was [this one](http://askubuntu.com/questions/20414/find-and-replace-text-within-a-file-using-commands) 




 **Below is what I wanted to post, but decided not to:**

This seems really simple, and I feel like I'm going to be embarrassed when I find out how to do this:

I want to take a file, to a find/replace using sed - however I don't want to make changes to the existing file - I want to keep the original file, but create a new file (or overwrite an existing file).

This is an example I found, but it does it in place:

    sed -i 's/original/new/g' file.txt

However in this case, file.txt has now been changed. I want to keep file.txt as-is, and create a new file `newFile.txt` instead.

Help?

That was what I typed out for my original post. After re-reading the Posting Guidelines, I decided I had not tried hard enough to figure out the answer on my own. 

Well guess what? Two minutes later I found exactly what I needed. 

Lesson: Sometimes you need to try a little harder before posting and asking for help.

 So then what's the point?  To replace Sublime Text and Atom?

Anyone play around with VSC yet?

 Yea I hear that - but what percentage don't have family to take care of? Would it be 50%? 80%? 10%? I have no idea. 




 Has anyone actually calculated the cost of putting someone on the street vs treating them 24/7 in a facility? The facility could easily cost the taxpayer $100k per year (that's a low number). Is it possible that him being on the street would more expensive than that? Doubtful, but it does have a cost. 




 The people who voted for Democrats who bankrupted this state need to feel the consequences of their actions (as well as wealthier folk who also voted for Democrats).  




 can you explain how it will cost the taxpayer if there are cuts?

 Digi-Capital has also included revenues from the Chinese Android app stores, which don't stock Google apps and don't give Google any cut of the revenue. Google's suite of apps aren't available in China after all."

Wait so China has their own Play store? 




 Thanks for the input, will take your advice. I'll fix up the site tonight. last question - in my html for the image reference, should I use the URL, or the local file location? I noticed you used url, but that is only because you wanted to show what it looked like. 




  img{
     width: 100%;
     max-width: 900px; /*or whatever number you fancy*/
 }

So that makes it look better in the browser, but now on my phone it seems to default to 900px (which is wider than the phone). 

Why does that happen? 




 So on the phone I want it to expand to the edges, but on desktop, if it expands to the edges its simply too large. 

I guess ideally I would want the picture to expand to a max number of pixels, which I think someone else has made that suggestion. 

EDIT: I like how you restructured the CSS. Thanks!
I am actually changing the picture to a different Rabbi, which has a ratio that is taller, and not wider.

EDIT: Although why the specific sizes for the text? Why not just use h1, h2, h3 etc?  




 Yea I know about bootstrap, but I haven't gotten into it yet. I will learn it at some point, but for now I want to know how to do this with just CSS. I shouldn't need a framework to accomplish such a simple task. 




 As long as Nestle keeps making my Nespresso, I'm good. 




 [Here](http://www.askyourlor.com) is a simple website that I am working on. I want it to display some text, and then a picture. The problem I am having is that it either looks great on mobile or desktop: but not both.

I'm using the 

     meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"

line to help with mobile (although I don't completely understand what it does). However the following code seems to make the picture too large on desktop:

        img {
            max-width: 100%;
        }

If I change the max-width to 60%, then it looks great on desktop, but the pic is then too small on mobile (it doesn't go all the way to the edges). 

Any help out there?
EDIT: Any other suggestions on my website are completely welcomed. And don't ask about the content.  




 Best comment so far 




 Ah I see. Well Saturday is impossible for me. WOuld I be able to come on Thursday and print out the tickets? 




 Lol so I gotta fly to Vegas in order to sell these tickets? 




 So what information are you adding here? That is a cancellation policy in case you don't pick it up. That's not what really what we are interested in. 




 It says this about Free Transfer Ticket -

 Why is there no Transfer button on my event in My Account?
Could be one of these:

 The venue doesn't offer Ticket Transfer yet (we're working on that)
The artist or venue turned Ticket Transfer off for that event/section

So it's possible that you can't. Will you be able to return the ticket? That's what I'm wondering. Their policy says up to 7 days, but this event could be excluded.

I have an Amex Business Plat card, and they can protect returns up to a certain amount (not sure how much).

EDIT: Amex will only cover up to $300. 




 What is the current rate of warming? 




 I thought the "Big 4" was Federer, Nadal, Djokovic, and Murray. 




 Powerball odds are around 1 in 170 million. I would probably say there won't be more than 10 million people trying to get the ticket at exactly 3 pm (and that is probably a gross overestimation). There are 500 tickets. So odds are 500 in 10,000,000, or 5 in 100,000, or really, 1 in 20,000. 

1 in 20,000 is significantly better than 1 in 170,000,000. 

So your odds of getting one of these tickets is 8500 times greater than winning the Powerball. 




 Interesting so that leaves Ticketmaster out. I wonder if that is for all tickets, or for TicketMaster only? 




 those 8000 are probably all promised to people already. Someone else noted that maybe you can't resell. Is that true? 




 what are you quoting? 




 So tickets go on sale at 3pm ET. Three places to get them:

* Ticketmaster.com
* Mgmgrand.com/mayweather
* Calling 800-745-300 (only 9 digits?)

So I guess the questions would be:

* Way to have the best odds of getting a ticket (there are only 500)
* Which ticket will have the *lowest* demand?
* Which ticket will give you the best return (total return, not percentage)

Since there are only 500 tickets going on sale, it will be almost impossible to get them, even if you go to the website at exactly 3pm. 

My theory - call 1 minute early to the phone number, and visit both websites at exactly 3. There is a chance those website won't be able to hand the load, and only those on the phone will get the tickets.

Is it even worth trying?

 You failed because you proposed a solution without even knowing what the data is. 




 Ok maybe, but def not what we have in mind - 1000 people walking around with headphones looking at art.  




 I should have specified - we want to *do* something - Art Institute is just walking around. I was thinking something sport or fun - not cultural. 




 It's a jpg for crying out loud. 




 I definately got a bit lucky. I got an internship for the team I currently work for, because I family friend of mine got me the interview (but not the job). After the summer they offered me a position for $75k. I'm not sure if my family friend had something to do with the salary, as it's corporate, and it's not like he can just throw money at me.

Anyway I have friends straight out of college who went to Seattle and got $100k, so $60-$70k sounds reasonable. Have you tried looking at Motorolla in the burbs? Boeing? CME? I don't know if the BA degree would hold you back after 5 years, but probably did when you first got a job.

As for helping you out, I only know of a position for a serious Oracle DB expert.  




 I work for a company with around 1000 people and we are looking for a venue for a summer party. We want a place where we can do something (not just hang around) outside - and somewhere we can go inside if the weather is bad.

Does such a place exist? We are located in the loop. 




 I am learning webdev on the side from my full time Java job - is photoshop really something you need to know? I am lost in the /s. 




 Ok I was thinking this was a redemption when buying tickets with miles - like the transferring to United and then buying a ticket with miles. I see that this is a bit different, and probably still not useful. 









 Had to zoom to 400% to read the article. That alone makes this a /r/shittyprogramming candidate 




 Just for some more data about Chicago -
I am a bit overpaid, but I make $75k (in the city) out of college only 4 months ago (I am also older, not sure if that changes anything).

I know that Motorolla (suburbs) pays at around $60k for some interns. HERE pays $50k for interns.

Just some numbers to think about. 




 at least this is the most upvoted comment 




  it's about the prisons wringing every last drop of money out of these guys

Um last I checked we *lose* money for keeping men in jail... 




  Depends on the religion.
 As a Muslim, there are

I stopped reading right there. 




 I had to add 'text-align: left' to the 'inner' class. The bullets were lined up, but the text was centered - so some of the text started next to the bullet, and some lines the text started far away (since there was little text to display, and it was centered).

I've just been googling everything I need to learn for CSS, but maybe some structured and detailed tutorials is what I need. Thanks for the help!

PS - didn't use codepen before - very helpful.

EDIT: my first codepen post- here is a demo of what change I had to make to your suggestion:

[my codepen](http://codepen.io/DanielGGordon/pen/QbLYzj) 




 Great answer! I tried the Flexbox version and it worked exactly how I wanted. Will try without Flexbox and report back. 




 Screw IE. 




 What is wrong with the design of the site? So hard to follow. I just wanted a simple top 10 list with names. Instead we go fancy yet annoyingly impossible to read graphs.  




 Elixir? 




 Holy cow flexbox is easy. Is flexbox not compatible with a lot of browsers? why not use it? 




 Jesus CSS is a pain in the ass. I'm learning it now. All I want to do is have a list of text (ul list), that is centered - but left aligned. So either I get bullets all the way on the left side of the screen, or bullets in the center, but completely scattered (they are not aligned vertically).

Cannot get this to work for the life of me. 









 I think I can guarantee the line number, or at least I can guarantee what the line will begin with (connection ... etc).

Yea I'm just wondering what too I can use. I have sed but not awk on Cmder. I have never used sec, but maybe that will work.  




 I like how OP specified that this is homework (not sarcasm). 




 Hi all!

I was wondering what is the best way to do the following (on Windows)

I have 4 .twb files (Tableau workbook - basically xml). Sometimes I will make changes to one workbook, and I want to copy the changes over the the other 3. The only difference between the workbooks is that they have different connection information. So really there is only a one line difference.

    connection authentication = myAuth schema='mySchema'

and so on. This line is different in each file, but everything else is the same.

How would I go about propagating all the changes from the first xml file to all four files - taking into account that the one particular line should not change for each file? 

Familiar with Java, so is there a simple library that can do this? Or maybe there is some script (scripting in windows?) I can write? I have Cmder, so maybe there is some utility for that I could use. Just need some direction. 




  Unfortunately I'd rather have the world be completely fucked climate wise in 100 years when I am dead than to have to live in a caliphate when I am old.

Both of those scenarios are hypothetical. 




 Would you say that is more of a stylistic thing, or there is a good reason for that? I agree with you that exceptions should be exceptions- but practically speaking I don't see why not use a try/catch for index out of bounds. 




 I'm calling bullshit on that one. 




 Because Europe is proving to have sustained a viable economic model? Greece? Spain? France? Even Denmark is showing signs that it's economic is not viable long-term. Not to mention comparisons to countries that are 1/60th of USA is not really a valid comparison. 

And you should read up on Sweden. They aren't doing so hot. 




 Regardless of their attitude, the 1%, **on average**, pay a higher effective tax rate (even when you include state, payroll, medicare etc) than the poor, the middle, and even upper middle class.
