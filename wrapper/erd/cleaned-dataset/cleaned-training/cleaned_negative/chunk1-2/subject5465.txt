 For my fellow ladies who are endowed with fleshy labias- getting your inner lips shoved into your baby hole during sex. It pinches the clit and pulls and ow :( 




 Sorceress, by Celia Rees. I don't know if anyone is familiar with it, but it's the sequel to her first book, called Witch Child. They're more young adult than fiction, but if you are interested in the Salem Witch Trials, I highly recommend both of these books. They're not about Salem, but about colonial era witch superstitions. Anyway, in Sorceress, the girl ends up married to an Native American man named Jaybird, and they have two children, a boy and a girl. I'm not going to spoil what happens, but just the writing is so heartwrenchingly good, I've read this book three times and every time I end up crying.

Also, Before I Fall. Bawled my eyes out. 





























 Selfie Sticks. Hate those things so much. 




 Circumcision is on that same line as vaccinating your child. It's your responsibility as a parent to make decisions for your child as they themselves are not able to. If you decide as a parent that the pros outweigh the cons, then get your child vaccinated, and vice versa. Any boys I have will probably be circumcised, and vaccinated, and put into a public school :) 




 There's nothing wrong with it. Its a parents choice, just like vaccinations. It's a parents responsibility to weigh pros and cons and make the decision based on what they believe is best for their child.
