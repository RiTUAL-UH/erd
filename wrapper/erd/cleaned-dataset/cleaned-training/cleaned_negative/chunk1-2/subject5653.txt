 Why not just tell me the entire fucking movie why don't yeah?

 




 The Shawshank Redemption came to me during a very dark period in my life. I was depressed, had a marriage fall apart and was stuck in a very strange place, a foreign city, a job I detested. Made me realise instead of fighting it to just go through the hole, face the problems, go deeper into it. The film works on several levels aside from the simple prison one. 









 imagine it was, but prob not, unless he was keto 




 Bingo my friend! 




 sound naff really. Like shut up I know my own destiny. 









 I believe it is serrano 









 People still ask that sort of thing?

Funny though nearly every girl I knew who in their early 20s was so thoroughly adamant that they would never get married have.

I wonder if they ask their single friends the same thing. 




 Yeah she is very easy to all in love with. 




 Really? Very disappointed.  




 Nope! It's from a blog page on old guns called The Arms Room. 














 Maps to the Stars was good. I ended up watching 3 films with the actress whose name I can't spell in a week or so. Stoker (5/10), The Double (3/10 mainly for the set design and lighting) and Maps (6.5/10 - the worst DC I have seen but still more interesting than most films, Julianne Moore is amazing in it)

Also saw Batman Vs. Robin and agree with below. Not the best of the recent movies but still good.

 Must be dying to see the direct to dvd Magic Mike 5: Hustle Town. 

Bad joke but my point is *Everything will upset someone who is looking to be upset.* 

It's kind of a pointless argument.

Also really strange choice of photo for a journalist. Almost smug, intentionally smug? Is her shtick to provoke? I don't mind that though. I like to be provoked.
