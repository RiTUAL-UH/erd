 Yes, be careful. Remember when reddit successfully identified 10 of the 2 Boston bombers? 









 I'm not lovin' it. 









 I see a Dos Equis commercial here. 




 I will pop right in with this submission to show how hard that is. 50,000 words ~~would be~~ is so tough to do! 




 That's right. OP should from now on proof his words prior to posting. 




 It's a 50,000 *word* book. 









 Where's the red line for this kind of stuff? 




 Actually, a good number of those Athenians were of the other persuasion, I hear. 




 From the article, TIL also that "toad" was a common nickname given to prostitutes and courtesans at the time. 
























 This is in North America, btw.

 Apparently the model for Chloe wasn't so happy in Paris."She, after throwing a party for friends, boiled a soup of poisonous matches, drank the concoction and died." The reason for her suicide is thought to be unrequited love. 

RIP Chloe. 




 Disgraceful yes, but I can report that the painting is doing just fine.  


































 Not me for sure, I may have assumed that people knew that the internet existed prior the the world wide web, and had its own stuff like chat, usenet, and muds/mushs. Sorry, a bad assumption. 









 Not sure if serious... 









 Sorry! Time heals all wounds. :) 




 Reddit... has anyone ever beaten the game, all of it? Just curious.
 














 I wish this wasn't buried. Well said, pacman. 




 I recommend [this article](http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/features/fearless-matriarch-of-resistance/story-e6frg6z6-1226111207166). VERY late in life (age 88 by my reckoning) she said she wanted to die in London and moved to an expensive hotel in Piccadilly. She ran out of money, though, but the hotel didn't want to kick her out. Prince Charles started footing the bill. She had her own stool at the hotel bar, where during her nineties she would have at least 6 gin and tonics a day. Good for her, I say. She died in 2011 at age 98. 




 And I don't wanna talk to a scientist.  














 I know someone who tried to eat a blackberry once. It had to be surgically removed and its battery had gone dead.

 Wow, that was quick! Glad to share your link. I'm very interested in what they cooked up in antiquity. 




 There's something very very strange in these woods, Cooper.

Oh, ewoks.

 Oh Perth. 









 They should call it the Colosseam. 









 I'm very curious as to why cycling isn't included as a most common mode of transport category. 



















 I've got a gut feeling that this field is just in its infancy, especially with the decreasing cost and increasing usefulness of metagenomic studies of the microbial flora within animals. 




 Apparently he wants to build the first one between San Francisco and LA. The trip would take 30 minutes. 




 Here is the original press release from the Edmonton Police:

 One of the most underrated games of the last couple of years, was Sleeping Dogs. 




 The original link contains this sentence:

"In a joint sale for US$40 million, Abbott sold their rights to Desoxyn and Tranxene to Ovation Pharma."

"Ovation Pharma" links to a page to their website and from there directly to the link I just posted, which shows undeniably that methamphetamine is sold by that company. Unless you think we need to be held hands around the internet, don't insult our intelligence.

 This is a real tragedy. I hope we can find some way of preserving magnetic tapes. There must be so much out there to preserve but the high throughput means of doing so escapes me. 









 What's the working language or languages there? 




 And here's an amazing video of a very brief encounter with these people...

 [How I imagine OP](http://imgur.com/vMIv2gj) 



















  In a 1986 paper, Brindley injected 17 different drugs into his own penis and measured the effects. The most successful dose resulted in an erection lasting 44 hours, well beyond the 4 hour limit after which Pfizer recommends you seek immediate medical assistance. 

Now there's dedication to science. 




 Shhh.... they don't follow the trend and have separate words for the fruit and the color, afaik, please correct me if wrong. 




 One of the most radical and abrupt shifts in healthcare policy ever enacted. 




  An ISIS spokesman, Omar al-Qahtani, confirmed that Mr Fares had been injured and, thinking he had been captured by members of a Shia militia against which he was fighting, asked them to kill him in terms misunderstood by the ISIS members in fact taking him to hospital. 

Am I the only one having trouble understanding what this paragraph is saying? The guy thought he had been captured by enemies, and so asked them to kill him?  




 Fun facts: oranges (the fruits) are called literally "Apples from China" in Eastern European languages and "Portugals" in Greek and Middle Eastern languages ([source](http://mapsontheweb.zoom-maps.com/image/66276524834)) and I'm pretty sure that most of them call the color orange the same, and for the same reason.

edit: very surprising amount of downvotes - I'm sorry, just wanted to start a discussion on the world's different words for orange, both the fruit and the color. 




 AMA request: Andy Kaufman. 




 I think they might be off a bit. According to wikipedia, all the gold in the world [is 9261 cubic meters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold). A tennis court is [10.97 m wide and 2 times 11.89 m long](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court), so has an area of 261 square meters. To get to 9261 cubic meters the tennis court would need to be filled to a depth of 9251 / 261 = 35.48 **meters**. Ahah! the old metric vs. imperial mistake strikes again. (edit: formatting and tldr)

**TL;DR** it's actually 116 feet. 




 Well that would be a good explanation for Rob Ford's weight. 




 Yes it is! If you were on a boat you would never need to turn your rudder. (Assuming zero wind and ocean currents.) 




 And if we just use the same units as we do here on earth, humans arrived 8 hours and 45 minutes ago, using the data from OP's link, was curious.

 [This page](http://theinquisition.eu/wordpress/2011/history/jameson-cannibalism/) has a little more on the affair, including a defence from Jameson delivered posthumously, which suggests the truth of what actually happened is a little murky. James Jameson died very shortly after the incident, by the way.

 









  Shakespeare caused return to be made that William the Conqueror was before Richard the Third

Apparently the use of the verb "to come" as a description of orgasm is recent. [This page](http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/7949/origin-of-the-word-cum) has some info. But anyways, kudos OP it's funny. 









 OP would like more discussion on this please. 




 The ninja turtles were unavailable for comment. 




 Amazing on face value but it's a recent source. OP, please post this in /r/news or /r/science or something. I'm skeptical to say the least. 




 Actually if it was Montreal there wouldn't be any NPCs there at all. And there'd be a lot more potholes. 




 Google tells me this is an example of the [Droste effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droste_effect). So, TIL again.

 Although this sounds cool I'm pretty skeptical about this. According to Wikipedia this was an [advertising stunt for Samsung](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Space_Planes). Not one of the found planes were verified, even the ones in Germany, let alone the ones on the other side of the world. The website and their [twitter feed](https://twitter.com/spaceplanes/) haven't been updated since 2011, shortly after the launch. If planes were really found a long way away, Samsung would be publicizing the bejeezus out of this!

 Indeed. Interestingly, these plants still possess a chloroplast genome, which has been sequenced. Since chloroplasts are responsible for photosynthesis, you would think that in this species, which has literally never seen the light of day, the chloroplast genome would have been lost over time. However, Rhizanthalla still retains a tiny number (37) of genes in its plastid genome, suggesting that chloroplasts have functions beyond that of photosynthesis. Much more [here](http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/news/rare-underground-orchid-genome-unlocked/).

 Gambia's [ruler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahya_Jammeh), by the way, is the guy who thinks he can cure AIDS and says he will cut off the heads of any homosexuals found in his country. 














 And it goes on...

 Approximately 24 hours later, redandwhite updated DPR, saying "Your problem has been taken care of... Rest easy though, because he won't be blackmailing anyone again. Ever.

 at DPR's request, redandwhite send DPR a picture of the victim after the job was done, with random numbers written on a piece of paper next to the victim that DPR had supplied. On April 5, 2013, DPR wrote redandwhite "I've received the picture and deleted it. Thank you again for your swift action." 




 It's in the [criminal complaint](http://www.scribd.com/doc/172768269/Ulbricht-Criminal-Complaint). WTF indeed. 




 So is the website for the [National Science Foundation](http://www.nsf.gov/). The [NCBI](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), whose website is used daily by life scientists around the world, has a red banner up saying that information on it may not be up to date. 














 Out of interest, here is Willem de Kooning's ["A tree in Naples"](http://www.moma.org/collection/object.php?object_id=80116) which is mentioned in the article. I wish there was a picture of the 4 year old's painting! 









 Also good is their "Is this written in Oracle bone script?". Have to start using that one at work. 




 Now this is a TIL! Thankyou OP. If only they had these "docking structures" more useful
