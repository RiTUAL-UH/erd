 Mike and Rachel killed me tonight! they were so cute, but then she cheated! I was proud of Mike for not forgiving her right away but then I wanted them back togetherIm so conflicted! 




 Its so obvious Hanna hates Ali. She is avoiding her big time! Im telling youHanna joined Mona. She cant face her. Shes drinking and stressed because shes afraid the girls might find out.
    Rhonda is so cute with her root beer and crunchy cheese doodles.
    I think E. Lamb was fired and pushed out of town by A.
    Poor Ella. I have a feeling they moved the wedding up because she got pregnant. Zach is an Asshole!!!!
    Did Sydney slip up on purpose about NY or by accident. (Id love to hear your thoughts on this!)
    I want to hear what everyone thinks about Alis behavior. All fake?
    I was shocked it was Noel who broke in the Marins house! When Ali first blurted his name out i had a heart attacki thought she was going to say he was A or something tp do with A!!
    Just a side thought..didnt Mona also ride horses? Remember she went with Kate and her friend when Hanna went? 

Thats all i have. Any comments?  




 Thanks for the info 




 Soooo we still don't know what Parrish is....And he doesnt know what he is either obviously. He was too funny when he was like Im only worth 5 dollars?!??? Loved this episode!!! 




 thanks you 2 




 thx a lot!! 









 Thanks so much! I`m going to try it! Have a good one! 




 Thanks for the input! 




 Itll bring armies to their knees. Cities will disappear in the blink of an eye. The world will be united in peace by the most just and noble country in the history of mankind. Or it will burn to the ground...

Anyone seen it? Is it worth it? 




 True Blood tonight was ridiculously boring. I mean come on, this is a final season! Dont put us to sleep! I want some action and some oh shit! moments, preferably lots of them!!! 









 I was kinda sure about that...well that`s that! After all they are husband and wife....in real life 





























 I would like some opionions on this new series...I`m conflicted about watching it...Any comments? 









 1) The Sopranos (it`a an absolute must)
2) Game of Thrones
3) The Big Bang Theory
4) Two and a Half Men (no Ashton seasons, only the Charlie Sheen ones)
5) How I met Your Mother (`though the last season is kinda dissapointing) 




 Ok, if you haven`t noticed, I`m a few days old on reddit so...I haven`t had the time to read all the things that have been written on this matter....
 




 Money beats being selective any day...I know, they don`t need it..but still, the rich will always want to be richer... 




 Finally! Someone who had the guts to say it! I applaude your courage! I`m with you on this matter....I like Sandy but this movie kinda ruined her as an actress for me...over hyped! 









 I actually start to care about Christie and Alaks story this season. Last season they were more part of their parents story but they really are coming into their on in this season. 




 Thanks a lot! 




 I hope there is...I am kinda sick of all this drama with them two...let it be over with and let the show `come back to normal` like in the first 2 seasons!!! 




 Seriously? that`s too much though!! 




 ooo...ok, i`m so sorry, i did not know about that! i`ll never do it again!!! sorry!! 




 Yep...apparently...
