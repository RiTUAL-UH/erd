 teeth gritting? 




 With the facial hair and the kind eyes you're definitely my type!! You're very handsome, 8/10 




 Brash but truthfully, thank you i appreciate that. I don't think i'm ugly so to speak, but there are definitely features that I would consider ugly and sometimes they're all I can see so it brings me down.
That's what it comes down to I think. My boyfriend always calls me pretty truly he does like any good boyfriend would! But i'm a woman and subsequently tend to be too hard on myself.. 




 And i take that as a huge compliment haha. I'm really flattered thank you :) 




 Actually, regal is a really cool way to put it. I honestly never thought of it that way 




 i must say, well phrased! thank you! 




 i may be somewhat biased because i absolutely LOVE facial hair, but i really do think it suits you quite well! I would keep it, you have the kind of look that needs a nice manly beard. Not enough me grow em these days! wear it proud :) 




 finally a numbered rate! thank you. As for my bulldog bite it is definitely there, it's receded to the point that is a few milimetres past my top jaw. Even with that though it shouldn't be past my top jaw at all so it still makes me fee; self conscious. Love to hear that it's not noticeable though so thank you :) 




 Keep the facial hair, really suits you and looks great on men in general! 




 Thank you, perhaps i have anxiety over looking different from the norm. There's always that "typical" pretty and i think just about every girl is looking for it aha. 




 I am a mix of German and English, half and half. Could that have anything to do with my jaw line? I live in Canada if that provides any context aswell haha. But thank you, didn't know there was a genetic line behind the trait! But i could have assumed.. 




 hahahaha. Thank you ;) 




 They do seem to be common and I have always wasted one, but that is the way I should be looking at it i suppose. My jaw gives me a very round/oval face and I have mixed feelings about that. But thank you a lot it's reassuring to receive comments like this! :) 




 Thanks! I grew up with a reeeally bad under bite, but i was lucky to have it recede on it's own to the point that it's only a few millimeters past my upper teeth. It's at the point that I wouldn't bother with the jaw correction surgery but it's still noticeable enough to bother me!  




 Thank you for the comment! He's my boyfriend of a year so he's not too difficult to attract haha. honestly I've just always been jealous pretty girls with cute pointy little chins! I don't have that but i think it's adorable. 
























 Everyone here complains about being lonely, but they resent seeing people happy and in a relationship anyways! 




 what's that?
 




 actually safest with him :) 














 I have this one outfit with a hood and an awesome bra that makes me look like a monster haha! But it's winter in Canada and it's cold now so i can't wear tutu's and stuff, I actually need shorts. 




 These are awesome!! haha :) I love seeing themes! I honestly never get pictures when i'm at raves, I do nothing but dance and glove, so this time I got a picture before i went! i'm jealous you have such an awesome pic durring the event! 




 thanks for defending me! You understood exactly. I didn't claim it was original and I know others dress similarly because it's a pretty typical attire at raves now, but I still think it can be made into a lot of fun and creativity. You can't see it in the picture but i'm also wearing a homemade mask and light up bow. So it's crafting too!  




 I invite anyone to post their costumes below!!! I love seeing new ideas! 









 A quick, to the point answer. Something I appreciate :) thanks! that's pretty cool 









 I think overbites are cute for some reason! But Olivia Wilde is a good example. Maybe i have less to worry about than i previously assumed haha 




 You look better without them, it draws the attention to your eyes which are very nice :) 




 well that's my smile so.... bummer.
