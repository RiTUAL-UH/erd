 So excited for that. My only concern is Nolan tends to overshadow his actors from time to time with spectacle. 




 He'll never have mine. A big part of my childhood is watching this movie over and over. This and Grease. I regret nothing! 




 "Hello, Stu. If you hang up, I will kill you."


"What my name's not Stu, I'm kevin."


"Oh um, oh ok I see there's Stu. Could you hang up and leave please?"


"Ok. ***hangs up*** [Sigh of relief]



 




 I'll give you my own. Not a movie but: Matthew McConaughey in true detective is such a departure from what he's been known for. 




 Gah! It moved! 




 Impressive. 




 Heigl. 




 If people could do that, I'd be terrified the first few times it happened. After that I'd do it to get out of doing stuff like Jury duty. 




 40 words max, go! 




 Reminds me of monster university and mystery men. 




 In your opinion, obviously.

 I just think no one wants to find bodies around the movie set. 




 You were doing so well until the butterfly effect. 




 Dr. Manhattan. Folks are gonna hate because this is a flawed character because of his abilities. I couldn't care less. 




 Mission to mars, Interstellar, Prometheus, Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy, lost in space, serenity 




 In that specific scenario, I wouldn't have walked backwards. I might get goosebumps. I'd only go backwards if there was some creature's face right behind me(less than a foot). 




 Yes, though. 




 No, I wanted him to die. He's almost like a force of nature and I wanted tommy lee jones to bring him down. 




 Oh no, he's despicable.  




 Are you not entertained?!



(Pause) no? 




 Devil's rejects

Natural born killers 




 This movie was most certainly horror, or at least gruesome. 




 The trailer explained it. Thank you michael Caine. 




 "Call it." He's why the movie is so good. 




 I said nothing! 




 Signs and No country for old men. 




 This is my favorite thread!  




 Good segment. 




 Zombieland should be on here.  




 Already purple for me. 




 I was hoping he'd make it but the nature of the title led me to expect exactly what happened. 




 GTA IV, getting special executions on Liberty City's worst. 




 Good morning! In less than an hour.... 




 Well, the original story is that they grew up in the same town. Lex is only slightly older than Clark. Batman Vs. Superman. 




 I was hoping for Jensen ackles. I'm fine with Chris Evans though. 




 This is just a list of actors who'd look funny in tightey whities, 




 Lex and Clark grew up together. This would only work in a time travel plot line. 




 You'll always have kickass 




 Norman bates wears what would be considered small town casual attire. However, in the climactic scene, it is revealed that he dresses as his mother. He NEEDS to feel her clothes on his skin to become her. In the final scenes the psychologist or detective(look it up) says that now Norma bates has completely taken over. We see him dressed as Norman but talking as his mother. He no longer needs to wear his mother's clothes to be her.


As for Marion, she basically wears the same clothes throughout the 30 minutes she's on film. Any suggestions I make would be far fetched. 




 Recently re watched No Country For Old Men. http://youtu.be/M4Wek1VIfjA


 




 So pissed and upset that we lost his talent. 




 Se7en 




 THEORY:Elizabeth Hurley did not play satan. Spoilers! She was an angel who disguised herself as satan to help teach Brendan Fraser a lesson. 




 Oh no, what have I done? 




 Russians who live in america. In the movie, radios still work. There would be a period of mistrust but eventually everyone would know the truth. 




 Wow, look at all these dead american men, women and children being killed. I as a Russian approve and will go out to greet these machines. 




 Cause of the killer robots.  




 This [guy](http://imgur.com/r/HighQualityGifs/FfnvQQD) knew how to wear suits! 




 Battle Los Angeles- Trailer creates one of the most anticipated alien invasion movies....Two hours of call of duty and marine circlejerk. 




 Pre-rescue: As we were moving to secure the North firehouse, a random bandit shot and killed me due to desync.

Rescue: Spriggs dropped a splint in a shed next to the firehouse. As the patient crawled to the dead drop, a zombie ran up to him and killed him with one hit.

 A reminder to medics: it's entirely up to you whether to pursue your ambushers. My priorities on rescues are the safety of the medic(s) and of the patient(s). While Going after ambushers can be fun, they usually have a tactical advantage over you. 



Take many precautions and be safe out there! 




 I consider it mediocre and hit-and-miss with their jokes.  




 More specifically his chemistry in a comedy group dynamic as the leader of a bunch of **** ups. If you haven't, watch a good old fashioned orgy. 




 Next bill Murray, called it! 




 I prefer to interpret this video as many people either trying to reach out to him to get him to stop fighting everyone or fighters sent by the government to knock him out to contain him. Either way, he kick/punches them all. 




 I think he meant one of the Reddit Rescue Force moderators(Teamspeak or Subreddit), due to the fact that you're setting it up as an "RRF" triage center. 




 Don't know how to vote on this one. 




 Stewart!!! 




 Signs. 

For those of you not aware, this movie is heavily criticized for it's lapses in logic and plot redundancies. Folks argue that suspension of disbelief is too difficult to maintain especially considering the "water" issue. However, I can easily look past those issues and simply enjoy, what is, in my opinion, one of Mel Gibson's best performances. His struggle post grieving/ now athiest on top of raising two children is only compounded by these strange lights and their farm's crop circles. You can see the emotion on his face as he is trying to be stable for his family and eventually admits that he doesn't know what to do. Such a strong performance as well as some genuine scares. 

"Move, children! Vamonos!" 




 *Double the action*

*Triple the excitement*

"GET DOWN!"

*More excitement*

"GET DOWN, AGAIN!!!" 




 Fell off a watchtower, broke my legs. Luckily, I didn't die. West side of airfield.

Rescued by: sebasceb. 




 A friend and I have been shot unconscious by lesser creatures. We are both by the western jail on the airfield. I'm normally too prideful to ask for help but sometimes the medics need medics. This is on regular on taking place in rescue room 1.  









 30+ HOURS IN GAME. looking to play with 1 or more people. the lone wolf thing is not for me all the time. Open to most play styles. The hero play style seems way too risky but it might be because I'm not too experienced. Comment or pm, if you're interested and what you're looking for.

 I've seen him in most of his films (minus Oldboy and his shorts) and I'm astonished how charismatic and believable he is onscreen.  












































 Example: Cardiologist=Fry cook 




 Please pretty please with cherry on top. Also I got a Kitty cat name Katie follow me asking me to take her to another town.

 For example: I work Security and have a structured routine everyday. It gets boring, so I tend to set myself on auto-pilot and think of other things. Crazy part: Like any auto-pilot, there are errors. I got into an argument with him for all of his screw-ups. I know he's just in my head, but as security I get bored and find myself talking to myself. I like to think that in my head I look like Bradley Whitford and my auto-pilot looks like Richard Jenkins from Cabin in the woods.


TL,DR: I, very recently, got into an argument with myself.  

















































 Oh my gawd yes. "Hey, are you even listening to me?" **Sheeeing!!!** 




 Quentin Tarantino- A film without references. 




 This is the end. 




 Repo men 




 American Psycho....maybe ;) 




 I still listen/ watch double toasted and rageselect. We need to stick together. I miss spill. 




 The original star wars, it helps that it follows the hero's journey format.

Also, skyfall. When it came out I saw a post highlighting that the cinematography is mirrored within the movie. 




 John Carter



The Lone Ranger





Green lantern 




 




 I can't call it for you, it wouldn't be fair. 




 I like it, it's not bad. 




 Texas chainsaw massacre created the slasher film as we now know it. 




 Yes, I think so. A performance is what ends up on screen, regardless of how it is reached. 




 It was in the original script. I think diamonds or jewelery. Tarantino decided not to use it since reservoir dogs already had a suitcase full of jewelery. 




 Law abiding citizen. 




 It is important as an actor to convey a real performance.


In this case the director took it upon himself to force a genuine performance out of his performers. A bad director would do this right off the bat without allowing the actors a few takes first but this is a proactive method in my opinion. It shouldn't go too far to the point of abuse, such as Hitchcock on the birds or Kubrick on the shining. 




 Yeah, I'm going to bring you something, alright. I decided to make you a special project of mine. You ain't going have to come looking for me at all.  




 You must've seen the American version. 




 Where's the last man? 




 Up in the air? The terminal? Dog day afternoon? 




 Would you hold still, please sir? 




 I am serious, and don't call me Shirley. 




 You don't know what you're talking about. 




 BING-O! 




 Le professional. 




 Me too, please add a tardis. 




 Recognize the actress or any other details? 




 Best:Raging bull
   

Worst: Hide and seek 




 1) the bag wasn't a threat to her, the mercenaries were. A bag is just a bag.


2) that rooftop was teeming with hostiles, she was probably finishing them off.


3)true lies, when (this woman) drops the Uzi and it kills all the terrorists. It's funny and I get the point but it still doesn't make sense.

 In the U.S. Edge of tomorrow hasn't come out and won't until June 6th. If you have a good sense of humor in line with family guy you might enjoy AMWTDITW if not then go with edge of tomorrow. (Beware, tom cruise runs a lot) 




 Will Ferrell- Everything must go. 




 Equilibrium  




 James Cameron's Avatar....it's pretty and that's it. 




 Bill. 




 Maybe you guys can't hear anymore. 




 Mark Wahlberg. 




 upvoted CP. 




 Breach? 




 Most movies I never revisit. I might re watch a movie either because it's good (District 9) or to give it another shot at the behest of others (Napoleon Dynamite) or just old favorites (Jurassic Park). If I watch a film at the movies it's usually just the 1 time. 




 I would love this cast...if it were another film. Why have I never heard of this movie?! 




 Maybe I'm in the minority but subtle product placement is good IMO, it can help immerse the audience. I'm taken out of movies when two characters are talking and one stops to drink "soda pop". Just drink coke or Pepsi like a real person please. 




 Lol. 




 How does he look like W.W.? 




 Wow. I'm lost.  




 It could be that they had the boy, it could be fixed with a line of dialogue. That is, if they want to bring him back. 




 Azazel? 




 Jack as Joker. He brought the comical psychopath to life. 




 I would like a superhero movie about a new, original superhero. Or maybe just a sequel to chronicle. 




 Ha ha ha 




 Oldboy. 




 It's nearly a shot for shot remake. Personally, I prefer REC because since the lead is not recognizable it is much easier to be immersed. Also I'd highly recommend REC 2 for being a creative follow up film. Have not seen Quarantine 2. 




 Yup, When he came on screen I almost yelled out "Godzilla isn't a threat, I AM THE DANGER!" 




 Tom Cruise is a movie star. Other than in movies where his characters name is the title (Jerry McGuire, Jack Reacher) it can be very hard to name his roles. 


An actor is an artist who would prefer you know them by their roles. Kevin Spacey is one such artist. He IS Frank Underwood. Kevin Spacey has made it a habit to stay out of the spotlight in order to better blend into his characters from the audiences' perspective. 




 Well you're concerned with the "branding" of the channel to make it more popular. I'm asking why no new videos? There are 3 up at the moment and I'm curious as to why? 




 I think a "Jury of your peers" is an obsolete practice and there are so many ways to manipulate these individuals.  









 I'm subscribed to it and since I frequently use YouTube I see it in my subscriptions lists.  




 I believe we were promised 2 videos a week. What's the issue? Are folks not sending in their rescues? Is there no time to edit and reformat the videos? What's up guys? 




 Dunno about Casey but definitely Jessica. 




 The following (season) takes place between 1:00 PM and 1:01 PM.


Events occur in frozen time. 




 Like that futurama episode. 




 ...and there's the mental image. 




 The Butterfly Effect. Let's have our main character abort himself. 




 In Kill Bill Vol. 1, Beatrix is in the kitchen talking to Vivica fox's character about when she could call it square between them. Una Thurman actually makes a square shape in the air when she says this, my guess is its a call back to her pulp fiction Mia Wallace character. 




 It's an awkward season, especially knowing what was happening behind the scenes. It's difficult to find laughs in that season. Also season 5 was funny with Harmon back but was tough to watch at points with the departure of two cast members. 




 Nolan. 




 Ah, yes. You're right, I go back and forth so much it just sort of melds together. I'll be more wary next time. 




 The first Harry Potter or Lord of the rings(fellowship). 




 No there wasn't but the writers thought it would be a good idea to imply that Debra was in love with Dexter. Gross. 




 Dexter: incest. ;( 




 Not a difficult movie to follow. 




 Also the game won't be out for a while, a lot can change and be rendered and tweaked between now and release. 




 Long live the king in the north!  




 This sounds like information overload, so much to catch up on can be overwhelming and terrifying. 




 I would prefer a man-woman pairing with the man being jaded and cynical and the woman young and idealistic. An added bonus would be if he's a sexist but really good at his job, kinda like Dr. House. I am personally a bit tired of the rural setting so either a big city or a snowy locale. Both of these places can foster feelings of isolation. I think the villain should be an active serial killer who makes it a point to contact the police. Also, a twist would be nice but not that one of the detectives is the killer (lazy writing).

Edit: also we need more tracking shots.

 I'm sensing you're a bit of a bitch.

 I'll [drop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_HuFuKiq8U) it here then. 




 District 9. It's important to find films that unite the two genres, romance and Sci-Fi. 


The fountain is very good as well. 




 Danny and Sandy (Grease)


Joel and Clementine (ESotSM)



Also any teen movie, romance just isn't like that anymore.


On the plus side there's always the ones that probably do stay together.


David and Elise (The Adjustment Bureau)



Ron and Hermoine (Harry potter series)



 




 I won't go that far but for me about halfway through i found myself talking to the screen. 


"Um, Superman, you're killing an awful lot of folks. er, ok. Wait, what? why are you upset that you [Spoilers-](#s "killed General Zod, you killed like at least 2,000 people")." 




 but you can replicate parts again and again to make a new ship or fix the part that broke. 




 well if it can replicate objects from the past, i could definitely see them fixing the ship...you know if they stop being girls about it. 




 But if the key is outside, it shouldn't be recreated. 




 Can't get much more elaborate than primer. 




 Was he peeing on the sandwich? or does he...pee sandwiches? 




 The ending was "underwhelmingly optimistic." That's how I'd describe it. 




 yeah, i did that intentionally, i feel silly for some reason. 




 Dude. spoilers. 




 Money talks?



From the wiki page: " In the meantime, Russell manages to escape from Villard's men, after placing several un-pinned grenades beneath his helicopter, ready to detonate if he tries to take off." 




 Yeah that movie is just a character study of a mentally ill individual.

 Final Destination 5. Only at the end though. 




 This one made me laugh. 




 It's darker when you know what the German soldier says: "Give up, you don't stand a chance! Let's end this here! It will be easier for you, much easier. You'll see it will be over quickly."
