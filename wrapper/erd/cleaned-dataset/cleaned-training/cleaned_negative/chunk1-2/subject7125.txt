 When Jack Kerouac's On the Road was first published in 1957 no one had ever seen anything quite like it. As it turns out, that stream of consciousness style that Kerouac made famous owes a huge debt to a letter written by his friend Neal Cassady.

  I expect we'll find out Jesus was bisexual, in an open marriage, and some otherkin's headmate. John the Baptist was a furry, by the way.

 The passing out does seem kind of inconsistent with the drug's profile 




 That would definitely be the best next step. 




 And it's only going to get worse! 




 The current Roosevelt Island Tramway waits are really short to non-existent most times of day and you can see when one is arriving above and time your own arrival around that. But it might be longer for more high-traffic routes like those being proposed here.

 No problem! It's a pretty epic project :D 




 Somewhat more detail here: http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/farmers-in-sahel-beat-back-drought-and-climate-change-with-trees/ and here: http://planetsave.com/2013/04/21/the-great-green-wall-of-africa-a-4000-mile-defense-against-climate-change/

 The trees will act as a barrier against desert winds, help to hold moisture in the air and soil, reduce erosion, enhance biodiversity, provide new grazing land and be a source of vegetation. The project is also recognized for the role it will play in local agriculture and employment.  
People used to go to towns to seek paid work during the lean season, but since the project started, that has changed, says Papa Sarr, Technical Director of the Senegal National Agency of the Great Green Wall.

 Thanks, I think - useful to make this into a ... wallpaper one supposes? 




 I believe that's called a 'sun dog' 




 Someone submitted it here, but it was axed by modbot and they didn't delete it and resubmit it with the pixel data as the modbot asked them to, which left  it in limbo (unable to be resubmitted with the same URL but perfectly fine if the URL were different or if that submitter deleted their submission of it and someone else submitted it with pixel info). Then I found the URL variant and figured I would try that instead. Worked! Yay!

 It was a good but strange listen. A good reminder that people take pride in things we might callously call cheap or ordinary, and that these things have long and interesting journeys to get to us.
