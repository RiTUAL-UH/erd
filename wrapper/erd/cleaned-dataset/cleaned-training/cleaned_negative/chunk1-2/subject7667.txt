 Hi everyone!

I wanted to ask all of you about how many kits from this season of Build Fighters Try you think will be released. From the first season we got 17 HG kits plus the MG kits still being released/ to be released. How many do you think we'll get from the second season? Cheers! 
























 We're already 20 episodes in and we have yet to see Sei, Reiji, Aila, or Fellini. What do you guys think? Will we see our favorite characters before the season ends? Thanks! :)
