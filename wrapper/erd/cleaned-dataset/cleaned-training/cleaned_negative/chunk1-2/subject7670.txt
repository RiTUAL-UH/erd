 Of All Time. Those are big, scary words. But when I think of my favorite books, I think about the books that had an emotional impact on me, good or bad. Blood Meridian by Cormac McCarthy always comes to mind when Im thinking about books that match that criteria. At the end of it I kind of just slowly closed the book and stared out the window for a while. It was also one of the rare books that I had to re-read to really get a better grasp on.

Id been writing to try and get published for a while. Then I took a break from writing altogether to pursue a career in law enforcement. Then I decided to write as a sort of stress relief, and to write whatever the hell I wanted to write and not worry about publication. Ive always been interested in survival and post-apocalyptic stories and sobamThe Remaining was born.

Oh man. What character do I identify with? Dont make me say it! Obviously, I identify with Lee in a lot of ways, but if Im being honest with myself, Lee is way more political than I am. Id probably have to say Im most similar to LaRouchefriendly most of the time, but with a tendency towards self-sabotage and kind of coarse. I really do have a warm caramel centerit just takes a little whiskey to get it out.

Haven't read it, so couldn't speak intelligently. 




 Dammit! Theyre on to me!
*pretends to write furiously*

Thanks for reading! 




 My name is DJ Molles. I got started self-publishing The Remaining series in 2012, got picked up by a publisher in 2014 (Orbit), and recently made it onto the New York Times bestseller list. The Remaining series is set to wrap up with the sixth book, Extinction, this month. Im currently neck-deep in my next writing projects, and loving it. Ill be answering your questions starting at 7pm EST, so have at it!

Edit: That's it for me tonight, folks. I'll check back in tomorrow evening to make sure I answer any late-comers. Thanks for stopping by! 
























 Thanks! 




 You know, as the story progressed I really started to enjoy Harper and Julia. I really liked the arc of those two characters, and how their own relationship with each other started to change. I started to look forward to writing their sections the most. 




 Wowie, there are some badass authors out there. I feel the need to give you a top ten list. But...I will force myself to answer your question: When I think of a favorite author, I actually think of Blake Crouch because I have yet to pick up a book of his and not like it. Simple as that.
