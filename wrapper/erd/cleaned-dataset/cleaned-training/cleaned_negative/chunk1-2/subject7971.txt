 The piece seems choppy, a haiku and a collection or notes for a more serious piece. I can't tell whether it's lazy, both for the writer and short-attention span readers, or thoughtfully crafted and that may be a strength. The format forces you to tell the story and tell it quickly, and that may be a plus. Is it affecting and moving? Yes, so it works as a piece. It's an experimental art form that is unsatisfying but yet manages to hang around because of its short, descriptive images. But it is not the future of story telling. The writer has real talent; he took a distant memory and gave it real-time urgency.     




 Drivers will view this as D-Day in the War on Cars.  




 I wish there was a Italian section. I'm no expert, but my understanding was that one time there was a small Italian neighborhood in DC but it was displaced by highway construction. There were some Italian grocery stores, at least one was left, on Connecticut in Dupont, but gone now. Baltimore has an Italian section with great restaurants and bakeries, but I haven't been there for 10 years. ... being from Connecticut, it's one thing I miss. 

But the Vietnamese food in this area is exceptional. The Eden Center in Falls Church is great. (not Metro accessible and no help to your question)

 @kavorka2 
.. is right on the money. My unit doesn't have a front desk or elevator. My condo fee is $160. 

.. A place I once lived in that had a front desk, three elevators and a pool, had condo fees in the $400+ plus range.  




 Actually, that's a really great deal. I live in 356 SF condo studio, and this place is about 15 SF bigger. But it also has a backyard -- which is awesome. 

Considering the backyard, and the fact that you own your own place without condo fees, this strikes me as a very good price. 

A custom-designed murphy bed unit, will create the illusion of even more space and get rid of the kitchen-bed problem. 

Does it have a basement? Can you add to the rear of the house? Another 100 SF and you can almost claim one bedroom, and can you build another story?

This will sell quickly at $248.   




 In Connecticut, when I'm visiting relatives, there are many auctions that sell low-end stuff. I've picked up old photos, postcards, books, magazines, art prints for as little as $5-20. Furniture can range from $25 to $1,000 or more, but mostly lower. It's been a different story around here.  




 Iron Man isn't playing at the Smithsonian theaters, unfortunately. But once you do move here, keep an eye on its listings http://www.si.edu/Imax/Showtimes
Sometimes it shows first run movies on its Imax screens. Oblivion is playing, but it's at its theater in Chantilly.  




 It seems like the problem is the last-mile provision. If DC entered into a contract that prohibits it from competing with Verizon, cable and others, then this service is permanently crippled and under utilized. It's great that when I use Mount Pleasant Library or MLK, the wifi is running at 20 MBS plus, but it would be wonderful if DC created area-wide hotspots, especially in under served areas. Good piece by Washington City Paper. This issue needs a lot more light. 



 




 I don't know how hidden this is, but the courtyard in the Portrait Gallery is an incredible hangout spot. Lots of seats, free high-speed Net, and refreshments, quiet and peaceful and right in the middle of downtown.  Open till 7 p.m.  




 Related question: Does anyone know any good auctions that aren't high-end? (i.e., furniture costing $45K) The kind of auctions were you can find relatively inexpensive items? 









 I'm glad they are using Duct-tape gray. Let's keep the memories alive!

 This isn't just about Wal-Mart vs. small stores. It's about big stores, too. Safeway prices can be pretty high, and anything that puts pressure on that chain is really welcomed. 

There's a lot I don't like about Wal-Mart. It constantly shifts the hours of its employees (along with other retailers), and keeps them under the threshold for benefits. It doesn't want full-time workers. It wages and benefits are so awful some employees must turn to government assistance, so there's some cost-shifting going on here. 

But the savings on some its products are real. For fixed income people, being able to save a dollar on a loaf of bread is a tangible thing. They will shop there. 

 




 It's good to have a sense of humor as well  









 You're kidding me.  




 Reuters is reporting that some NGOs are blaming market demand for low priced clothing. Margins are so tight that manufacturers are cutting corners on safety: http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/25/bangladesh-building-idUSL6N0DC3N220130425

It's a fair point and something to think about, even if the source of this particular structural failure may be -- and I'm guessing here -- the fault of builders and/or inspectors.  




 I like the fact that the Vegas Lounge building has survived the apartment complex invasion on P at 14th, but the few interesting buildings remaining, it seems, are gradually being removed and replaced with higher density development. 

Separately, it's just astonishing to me the amount of development on 14th north and south of U. The entire street is gradually being turned into a glass wall of complexes.

I really miss the old antiques store on 14th. 

 




 I like the description, "yet another generic 8-floor development in DC." Generic is probably right. DC needs a Gaudi to infuse some dramatic into buildings that are just blending into one another.  




 Here's an approach that was recommended to us and it work for me: Go to a condo with a front desk and just ask if any of the units are available for rent. With luck, you may catch an availability before it is listed online or find someone who isn't trying all that hard to rent their place, or learn of someone who is about to have a vacancy. 

 




 But populating it with junk content will deter readers as well.  




 This is a waste of precious natural electronic resources.

 This isn't a recommendation, just a report. I've been a member of Bally's now LA Fitness since 1998 at 20th and L. Pay about $20 a month, but new memberships are about $29.00. 

Plus: Plenty of weight machines, usually kept in good shape. Plenty of treadmills and there is almost never a wait to use them. Equipment seems well maintained.  

Lockers: Blah and ugly. Never quite as clean as you would like it. Most of the showers have limited water flow, but there's usually soap. They don't supply towels. 

If you don't mind the ambiance, it's not a bad value.
 




 It's like entering a jewelry store. You feel the hush. 

I didn't test the willingness of the clerks to let me play with the equipment. Some nice camera bags as well, although I didn't check them on price. 

The other day when I walked by it, I saw a customer standing just outside the door with someone who appeared to be a sales rep. He appeared to be testing out a telephoto lens. I saw that as a good sign for the store.  




 *Replacing* physical colleges? No. Augmenting? Yes.  




 Wow -- 

the programmer makes one direct and one indirect suggestion for combating this 

(1) have programmers from both parties review the source code 

(2) if election results vary significantly from exit polling data, that polling data may offer a clear reason to investigate election. 

Finally, these allegations deserve a major investigation by federal authorities and Congress.

 I live in Adams Morgan and parked off-street until I gave up the car. It wasn't easy and I could spend 20 minutes, routinely, driving around waiting for a space to open up. 

RPP fees would make no difference. Zero. Higher RPP fees is a nit in the calculation of whether you can live without a car. 

I gave up owning a car only because I didn't need it. Adams Morgan may be awful for parking, but it's well served by buses and the Metro lines aren't a bad walk. My job didn't require a commute mandating a car. 

But I know people who need a car to get to their place of work. If you need to jump on a bus, jump on the Metro, and then a bus again, that commute just won't work. A car is easier. 

For that matter, there are many neighborhoods in DC were bus service is not as regular as it is in close-in neighborhoods. I rarely have to wait more than 10 min for a bus. But some bus lines may not hit a stop for 30 min, 45 min or longer. 

All I can say about parking minimums is that ship has sailed. Many of the apartment complexes in Adams Morgan were built in a time when cars weren't an issue. My building only has a handful of spaces. I see no gain in demanding that newer buildings add more parking because my building was built with very little parking. 



 




 I lived in the Jefferson House for about 10 years. Only moved because owner was selling unit. I was on the top floor. Very quite. Never heard neighbors. Solid cement/brick building. Front desk was great for getting packages and the like. The building doesn't allow washer/driers in units but has laundry room. The pool is nice. Elevators are relatively new. Combination long-term residents and grad students, mostly. Never been inside the President. 

One thing regarding noise: If you have a unit in the rear, to the right (if you are standing in front of the building), the GW students in the townhouses below and sometimes in the student housing (former hotel building) at K, sometimes hold very loud and noisy parties until 2-3 a.m. Generally, this noise never bothered me, but it could be more of an issue on lower floors. 




 You can contribute to the museum by taking out a membership. It comes with a great magazine and 10% off purchases. They also have donation boxes near entrances.  




 I'll endorse that. The NPG is a gem -- and it's open to until 7 p.m. 

It's courtyard is awesome. Here, in the middle of a very busy area, is a wonderful place to sit. Free WiFi, too. I think the speeds are around 20 mps. 

 




 DC is top tourist attraction. It would not surprise me if some people cross DC off the their list of vacation possibilities because they'll read this stuff and say "the Smithsonian is closed!" -- 

If this leads to lost tourist dollars, that will really hurt.  









 It's obviously not spam. I live in DC. I read local blogs. I don't contribute to Reddit but thought I'd give it a try. But look at her blog. It's real and authentic and its about DC. If you are moderator and you have access to email from members, then look at mine and it will tell you who I am.  




 I submitted the link; who are you and why does it matter? It's not my blog -- I just thought the parking photos were interesting.  














 Excellent point  




 It can do basic editing. The native tool on the machine doesn't offer much, but the apps store is loaded with some very good photo editing tools. It adds a step to upload, but generally it's a minor issue.  
























 The young woman's car is hit on the bridge in an accident that involves tractor trailers. Horrifying enough. But the force of the crash is enough to send her car either though or over whatever bridge railing is there to keep vehicles on the bridge. Her vehicle plunges 40 feet into the bay -- three to four stories of free fall. She experiences hitting the bay in an explosion of water. Injured and shocked, she is in a vehicle that's sinking and starting to drift. Her options for saving herself are narrowing quickly. Fighting current and probably disorientation, she escapes the vehicle and swims to a bridge pylon. Imagine. Just imagine. 

This is one tough woman. 

 




 Have they said that?  




 Since 2008, I'm just not sure, but this story from 2005 is part of the lore: http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all address=104x4154435 




 This is a Cinderella privilege with an expiration date. People should be allowed to drink water on Metro 365 days a year. There's no sound reason for prohibiting people from drinking water. I can understand a ban on French Fries, but water? It's time to decriminalize water.  




 @beer_OMG_beer  is absolutely correct. Comparing a Walmart worker to a government worker is a major fail. Walmart workers are often restricted to part-time hours without benefits and have a work schedule that constantly changes (if they make themselves available for anytime work, their hours may improve but ability to attend college or meet family needs declines).

  Are you renting in a condo complex or apt? Is it a separate facility or just a bike rack? Does the space used for bikes have the potential to generate revenue in other ways?

A condo association may have the option of taking empty space and renting it out as storage. Instead, they make it available to bikers. I could see the argument on the condo board: Why should people who don't bike subsidize the loss of income the empty space might generate as storage space?  But then, there has to be enough bikers interested space to cover the cost. If there weren't, you probably wouldn't have the rental space option. Consider yourself lucky. Otherwise, you're stuck like me with the bike in the apt.  




 I bought in DC in early 2008 when the market was softening and the worst was still to come. I did not have a big down payment and it was risky from that point of view. Not the best decision, but what was done was done. After I bought it, the price of my unit fell about 5%-10 to perhaps as much as 20% from what I paid. It has since recovered. With a new assessment, I recently re-financed and lowered my mortgage cost by nearly a third. Previous rate was 6.5%. Now at about 3.5%. Lost PMI, too. 

My monthly mortgage, plus taxes, including condo fee (non-elevator building so its on the low side), is well below market rents. 

Rents are ridiculous now. But the mortgage costs remain low, even at 4%. 

So what should you be worried about the most? That mortgage rates will rise to 6-9% or that housing prices won't fall? 

My view: If you truly planning on staying in DC for a period of years and are set on that, then I would try to buy when the interest rates are low. If prices fall now, I suspect it will due to rising interest rates. One way or another, you'll be paying more. 

More directly to your question: I don't think we will see a repeat of 2008-09. That was a historic crash. I do believe the market can soften if interest rates rise, and I think with the rates now checking in at about 4% demand for housing may rise some as some people try to lock in better rates before they go much higher.  




 I don't blame them. This risk is readers, who may already be up to their necks in monthly subscription charges for other content, NYT, Netflix, etc.,  Hulu, Rhapsody, whatever, may resist. Subscription costs are really becoming a burden, but what choice does WaPo have?  

I dumped cable long ago to save money (use DSL) and watch TV via antenna (which is actually pretty good in DC proper) and Internet content. That has helped to offset some the subscription charges. 
 




 Good suggestion - thanks
 




 Good feedback everyone - Thanks 




  Don't see many people using them. But they are appealing.  




 I don't own a car, hence no insurance. I've wondered about the credit card provisions and whether they really do protect you. 




 I have a 20-year old scratched-up, tear-in-the-seat, bike that's beat-up ugly. But it rides and I keep the components in good shape. When parking on the street, I use two U-locks to lock in both tires and thread a cable cord through the seat.  Not that anyone would steal it, I imagine. I've been thinking about buying a new bike. But wonder: Even with two U-locks, what are the odds that it will get stolen or damaged in D.C.? Is it even worth owning a good bike if you lock it from time to time on the street? (I'm not talking overnight, but about running errands, stopping to eat, etc.) I'm considering something like a Tern folding bike. (Something easy to take on travel and store) 




 What do you do for car insurance? I can get a good car rental rate, but end up adding $$ in coverage that can easily double the rental charge. Have a personal umbrella.  




 I don't have a car and absolutely do not miss owning one. DC is an easy city to bike and is getting better. The bus system is good once you figure it out and in many cases faster than dealing with Metro. 

But owning a bike isn't easy. Good bikes are at risk of getting stolen. For around town, and have plans to lock your bike on a street for some hours, recommend a beater, nothing too attractive, and lock both wheels. 

Personally, I think folding bikes are a great option for commuting if you can stash them inside.

 It's more than just spending money. The chips may be U.S. but the interconnects are Chinese tech. The front end system that runs this new system is using a Chinese-made chip, 16 core SPARC. China is planning to build a system with its own chips. It also has its own software 

China is learning and quickly. This isn't just about buying a system, it's about learning to build a very fast system that is also energy efficient and reliable.  




 Facial recognition is the killer app. I could really benefit from something that could remind just who is at the meeting ... 




 This piece by Ross Douthat was short on history. Ten-15 years ago you could buy condos with credits cards, and houses next to Metro at affordable prices. But people began to realize, even before the big defense build-up post 9/11, that DC was way undervalued compared to NY and Boston, and an attractive place to live. Yes, there's a lot of building going on now but much of it is catch-up. DC is becoming the city it should have always been considering the quality of life.  




 No, do what I did and suggest it's about money and getting rid of cars. that will get you down voted to oblivion.  




 The only thing the park snakes sequester are rats. They are virtuous creatures compared to what goes on in the rest of DC.  




 This is about money and the 'war on cars,' nothing more.  




 I don't know how many Vietnam vets still ride in Rolling Thunder. I imagine a good number remain. I have enormous respect for them. Vietnam was a horrible mistake. More than 58,000 U.S. military personnel lost their lives in that war, and many of the survivors weren't treated well upon return. There was no "thank you for your service" stuff that you hear today for the vets. So I don't mind at all Rolling Thunder. Let them turn up their engines and roar into the city, and if that bothers you, you can shove it.  




 I rented a place in Foggy Bottom in 1998 and you could buy a townhouse nearby  anywhere from $160 to $250. I remember seeing one sign in a condo that was almost directly across from the Metro on 24th that said "lease to own." I was actually surprised.  I had just come form the New England, a depressed city up north, and housing there was selling for the same price without access to a Metro, world-class museums, and a great jobs market. DC was incredibly under priced.

 If they are a certain age, then getting them close to a Metro stop is best. I'd recommend a downtown hotel, such as JW Marriott, Hyatt or something like that. Sometimes you can get good rates. The Metro escalators aren't that long, the areas are safe and well patrolled, and there's plenty nearby. Anything near the Portrait Gallery is super.  




 Great reporting by WAMU. 




 I guess my broader point is this: I wish the Washington Times would actually do some reporting on this issue and discover whether standard liability policies provide some protection. That may satisfy this requirement. It would be nice if they did a little work in finding out just where this idea of $250K gun-specific liability policy comes from. Did it arrive out of thin air? If that's the case, then it seems really hard for the council to impose a requirement that can't be satisfied.  




 I worry for Tumblr. Making an intelligent acquisition is not the same thing as doing something intelligent with it.  




 I love how the Washington Times puts this as "prohibitively expensive" and then launches into a rant. It makes no effort to look into the issue. Wouldn't personal umbrella policies protect from the jerks who accidentally blow holes through their condo walls? If you have auto insurance, it's already a really good idea to spend an extra $200-$300 a year on an $1 million umbrella policy, considering the cost of medical care.
