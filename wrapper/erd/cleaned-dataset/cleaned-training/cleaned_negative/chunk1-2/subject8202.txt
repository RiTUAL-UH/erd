 Umm what was that?? 




 GRONK SMASH!!! 




 Its before the Pepsi halftime show  




 Who cares it's a year away 




 Maybe r/CFB should have its own super bowl game thread so that it not overcrowded and full of irrational discussions 




 Of course they do this after cutting multiple former AirTran routes  




 Well good luck man. You can message me if you get lonely   




 it helps for me that I go to a small school (like 2100) so its kinda hard to not make friends over time becauase you know everyone. We don't hang out that much, maybe once or twice a month, and most of my "social" activity is with my roommate (who I actually like which is good). The most activity that I do with my friends is have lunch. So I'm still kinda a "shut in" but I am more active now.  




 A Republican a hypocrite? NEVER 




 I'm shocked, SHOCKED. That Jeb Bush was ever a bully considering how nice he was to the Schiavo's 




 We may be amongst the last now, but when the supreme court rules we hopefully won't have a gay marriage ban. Think of it like the sodomy laws. Georgia's was overturned by the state supreme court about 6 years before the supreme court overturned it nationally (though the Georgia case didn't involve a gay couple). Even though we were amongst the last we weren't THE last.  




 I'm in my last semester. I didn't really start making until my 5th semester and now I have a small circle of friends.  




 good for him 




 Can I buy you a drink or do you just want the money? 




 Yes I am, Yes I am, Yes I am! 




 As a native Georgian I totally understand - I was pissed about Alabama, South Carolina, and Mississippi's laws being declared unconstitutional before us. I just want it to be legal here before the Supreme Court has the final word so that we can say that we weren't among the last  




 My Freshman year of college every Friday and Saturday evening I would order a pizza (or some other type of takeout food) and take my laptop into the study room in my dorm and just sit there and watch Netflix until about 2am while everyone else in the dorm was either hanging out or throwing parties. It was quite common for me to have to wear headphones just so I could hear because of all of the noise from people having fun. I would always make sure that my roommate was asleep before I went back into the room (he was a stoner and a party animal so this is why I didn't want to be in that room). The way that I would make sure that he was asleep is that I would go outside the building and look to see if the light was on in our room. Once it was out I would finally be able to go get some sleep. This went on my entire freshman year. 




 How about she loves me unconditionally. No matter what happens she is always there to cheer me up.  




 The organization I work for advocates fewer environmental regulations and is against a minimum wage increase  




 That shirts very becoming on you. Of course, if I were on you Id be coming too 




 because she is awesome!! 




 I though it said Prague at first

 Any other American breath a sign of relief once they realized that this was in Canada and not the US. (not to take away the awfulness of the case)

 My dad convinced me and my brother that the hazard lights button was a "hyper button" that would make the car go faster. When ever he pushed it he would slam on the gas to make us believe that it was the case. I quickly figured it out but my brother would go on believing this for years.  




 The families of the Chinese victims did. 
But some families were upset that the government decided on the fate of their loved ones without any concrete evidence.

In China, some family members refused to accept the official position that the plane was lost.
"They have found nothing," said Li Jingxin whose brother is missing.
"With nothing found, how can they make any announcement?''

Clearly they are so full of grief that they can't accept reality 
 




 Yeah it does seem a little excessive. The idea makes some practical sense but as always the implementation doesn't.  




 As a result of this coming out in the Israeli press the American Family Associations spokesman Bryan Fischer has been fired http://www.mediaite.com/tv/evangelist-bryan-fischer-has-been-fired-maddow-reports/ 




 That's why he was fired. The Israeli press found out about this group and asked why is a group whose spokesman, Bryan Fischer,says America a christian nation, founded for christians, and only christians are guaranteed first amendment rights is funding a trip to Israel (the JEWISH homeland) for a major political party. Needless to say once all of the past things that Bryan said were reported on it did not look good in Israel so they fired him. They didn't have a problem with him until now. So don't believe anything the American Family Association says about them not standing for what Bryan says. MSNBC's Rachel Maddow does a great breakdown of the whole affair http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/bryan-fischer-fired-ahead-of-rnc-israel-trip-390575171843 (the video in the link wouldn't work for me)  




 The video in the link wasn't working for me so I'll post the video from the MSNBC website [here](http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/bryan-fischer-fired-ahead-of-rnc-israel-trip-390575171843), it is worth watching. 

TL;DR 

He wasn't fired because he was an anti-gay, racist, sexist, bigot. He was fired because the American Family Association is founding a trip to Israel for over 50 GOP members, including the party chair Reince Priebus. The Israeli press found out about this group and asked why is a group whose spokesman, Bryan Fischer, says America a christian nation, founded for christians, and only christians are guaranteed first amendment rights founding a trip to Israel (the JEWISH homeland) for a major political party. Needless to say once all of the past things that Bryan said were reported on it did not look good in Israel so they fired him. They didn't have a problem with him until now. So don't believe anything the American Family Association says about them not standing for what Bryan says.  




 The theory is that sense electric cars don't use gas they don't pay the gas tax, which funds roads. Therefore in a sense they are using the roads for "free" while everyone else is contributing to their upkeep through the gas tax. So you just charge them a straight up tax for having an electric car to make up for them not paying the gas tax.  




 Doesn't Putin want a bunch of far-right parties to be in power sense he is bankrolling most of them.  




 A little back story

Roy Moore is a big time Christian. Before he was on the Alabama Supreme Court he opened all his cases with a prayer. He called on Alabama to use it's powers to punish "homosexual behavior". He famously put a ten commandments statue in the Alabama Supreme Court building in 2002. He was taken to court by secular groups and they got a federal court to order it's removal. He refused and was subsequently removed from the court by a judicial oversight board. Alabamans reelected him to his former position in 2012 




 Georgia definitely needs to increase transportation funding and this seems like a good proposal, but I'm skeptical of anything that comes from the state GOP.  




 take $350 million from the highway fund over 2 1/2 years

So now their roads and schools will be shit

 Setting multiple alarms on my phone and placing the phone on the other side of the room. But to be honest what gets me out of bed most morning is having to pee.  




 As I told the other guy my position is that the money in politics - whether it's from the Kochs, Unions, Soros, Sheldon Adelson, McCutcheon, whoever - is DISGUSTING and TOXIC on our democracy and should be abolished.  




 Yes because conservatives don't have a hateful bone in their [body](http://www.lgbtqnation.com/2015/01/okla-career-anti-gay-lawmaker-introduces-3-bills-targeting-lgbt-community/) 




 Damn, Malaysia Airlines can't catch a break.  




 He deleted his account. You think we scared him off?  




 So you are comparing now to 100 years ago? Hmm where have I heard that [before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aV1VUS3Q2W0). So you want to cut programs that help people like Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, and SNAP and prolong their struggle and let them decend into poverty? How nice of you. The only thing that needs to be cut is the DoD, and we need to raise taxes on the rich on close corporate and capital gains tax loopholes.  




 That makes no fucking sense. How has the "government expanding out of control" (ps it hasn't) led to a system favoring the wealthy. Large government means more protections for individuals - usually low income or middle class. Less government means less regulations which means more money to be made for corporations and their CEOs. AKA the Kochs  




 Oh you poor thing you're taxed to death! 
Seeing as you make only $30,000 a year (as you state in a post here:np.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/2mybbb/an_open_letter_to_reddit_liberals_from_a_reddit/) you already don't pay that much in taxes as you fall into a low tax bracket. I am advocating the abolition of super PACs and a limit on the amount of money you can give campaigns. What I would do first is say that money is not free speech, abolish super PACs, and say that corporations could not donate to candidates campaigns. People could still donate to political parties and candidates but it would only be $500 max. Then what I would do is close corporate tax loopholes and capital gains loopholes and use some (like maybe 6%) available for campaigns to dip into if they want, split evenly of course (by the way those taxes wouldn't affect you). 




 It's still $300 million less than the Kochs  




 My narrative is that the money in politics - whether it's from the Kochs, Unions, Soros, Sheldon Adelson, McCutcheon, whoever - is DISGUSTING and TOXIC on our democracy and should be abolished. I still fail to see how you can't agree with this.   




 Your link proves my point. Outside groups - Koch - spent more on elections than Obama did. The fact that billionaires are trying to buy our elections is disgusting and I don't know why anyone would support them. And I call it the Fox News strategy because they pioneered it. 




 Seeing how the average voter in this country is incredibly misinformed, if you see an ad repeating the same lie it becomes true over time. It's called the Fox News strategy   




 Of course he is a Republican  




 Of course a Republican  




 What world do you live in. This is NOT democracy. This is a few billionaires buying our elections. Left or Right it doesn't matter it should be illegal. This amount of money in elections is DISGUSTING. And by the way I missed the announcement, since when did greenpeace and unions have $900 million to spend on elections?  




  ~~Satan~~ Saban

Better yet why don't they ask the people that paid his mortgage 

 




 Money is NOT free speech. All is does is buy elections for the wealthy. This is a democracy not an oligarchy. And by the way unions don't spend as much as the Kochs and I don't think they should have the right to spend money on elections either.   




 you can thank the Supreme Court 
 




 What part of money in politics is toxic don't you understand  




 I think money in politics is toxic no matter the party. However I can't stand republicans acting like George Soros is on equal footing with the Kochs. The Kochs put Soros to shame with the amount of money they spend.  




 Do you honestly believe that?  




 Yeah close to that. They probably want to be like the NBA and NHL where  half the league goes to the playoffs.  




 While I agree with ESPN here that Jan 2 would make more sense for the semifinal games than NYE but they knew this would happen when they signed the contract. You can't sign a contract and then back out. And who knows maybe having the semifinal games on NYE will be a ratings bonanza. You don't know until you try.  




 Fuck the NFL. They don't need more playoff games.  




 That's my face when I'm on an airplane with a screaming kid.

 Ted hasn't owned the team for about 19 years. When he sold Turner Broadcasting to TimeWarner in 1996 they got the Braves as part of the deal. TimeWarner sold the Braves to Liberty Media, a holding company controlled by John C. Malone, in 2006/2007. The Braves signed a TV deal about 5/7 years back with FOX Sports South/SportSouth, two regional sports networks owned by Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox (formally News Corp). The deal was for 20 years and pays only $15 million a year. For comparison the San Diego Padres signed a contract 3 years later for $40 million a years and the Texas Rangers signed a contract 2 years later for $80 million a year. Logically if the Braves TV contract were on the open market today it could fetch somewhere between those numbers if not more. So yeah the Braves have a shitty TV contract that they are stuck with until the late 2020s.  




 the public transportation will still be shit though and traffic will be a NIGHTMARE as its right where 285 and 75 meet. 




 thats fucking wrong, it hurts business because they don't know if the government is going to shut down one day or if the debt ceiling will be raised because the GOP likes using our economy as a bargaining chip.

 Color me shocked that they actually apologized TWICE. The first apology seemed well thought out and articulate but the second one was clearly scripted and came off as fake - especially that smile at the end. Changes nothing about Fox though.  




 will they be in Baylor green?  




 You put way too much effort into this, you need to start lowering your expectations now.

Edited for grammar and spelling  




 of course it is /s  




 the thing is that with cable networks (which is probably what you watched 28 days later on) don't have any rules when it comes to nudity or swearing they do all of the censoring on their own voluntarily. Broadcast networks like ABC, NBC, CBS, and Fox do however have rules regarding said stuff.  




 I don't believe anything that comes out of his mouth 




 Fox News rule no. 1 is to NEVER admit that you were wrong. There was the infamous incident when one of their anchors made the statement that "santa just is white". After a ton of backlash the next day she said that it was a joke (even though it clearly wasn't) and that people criticizing her were clearly liberals who were scared about how powerful Fox News is.

 I give a shit that the wins were restored because Penn St. is acting like they were the victims in this whole debacle, not the KIDS THAT WERE RAPED on their own campus. Is the NCAA a shit show? No doubt about it. But why should Penn St get special treatment after the fact when schools like USC and Miami were not. Especially sense the scandals at USC and Miami weren't nearly as bad as the Penn St scandal.  




 
What is most damning, for me, is that Paterno convinced Schultz, Spanier, and Curley to NOT go to police. After the other 3 resolved to go to Department of Welfare, Paterno convinced them NOT to do that. That is horrible.

"According to CNN in an email dated Feb. 26, 2001, Schultz wrote to Curley about a three-part plan that included talking "with the subject asap regarding the future appropriate use of the University facility,"  "contacting the chair of the charitable organization" and "contacting the Department of Welfare."
Former Penn State athletic director Tim Curley's alleged email could be damaging for Joe Paterno. (AP) It would have been better to skip directly to the third action and let the welfare authorities do the meeting and informing, but this should've been enough to end Sandusky's reign of terror. Except that Curley sent an email to Schultz and school president Graham Spanier on Feb. 27, 2001, that changed everything.
"After giving it more thought and talking it over with Joe yesterday, I am uncomfortable with what we agreed were the next steps. I am having trouble with going to everyone but the person involved. I would be more comfortable meeting with the person and tell them about the information we received and tell them we are aware of the first situation," Curley's email said

 too me it seems like people are jumping thru hopes to try and come up with a way to say that JoePa was innocent. If I were Joe I would have gone to the police once the administration did nothing or at the very least told Sandusky that I never wanted to see him around the campus facilities again 




 no he wasn't almost 60, he was 55. yeah JoePa wasn't close to retiring but he still could have kept coaching. JoePa told the administration what he had heard and once it became clear that the Penn St administration was covering CHILD MOLESTATION ON THEIR OWN FUCKING CAMPUS  up he should have gone to the police like and normal human being with a conscious .  




 what are you talking about, he's 70 now. he retired in 1999 at the age of 55. 




 It still doesn't change the fact that if Joe went to police that they would have taken him seriously. This man was a god in central PA, if he had evidence, even circumstantial or hearsay, the police would have done everything they could to investigate. The facts that that you site doesn't change the fact that Joe did nothing to stop what was happening and the Penn St. actively covered it up.  




 Ah another Paterno apologist. No he knew. Sandusky went from being coach in waiting to randomly retiring. The fact of the matter is that Penn St and Joe Paterno cared more about football than stopping a CHILD MOLESTER. 

 




 I was agreeing with you  




 Southerner here who's actually been to France. I would say that what most people here say is true. The NE is more densely populated and has better flight connections to Europe that the Southern, Midwestern, or Western part of the country. It also helps that NYC is a huge financial center and Washington is the political center of the country. Also like someone else said people out west may have a stronger connection to Asia and people in the southwest have a stronger connection to Latin America.  




 Cleveland might be NE politically or culturally but from a technical definition Ohio is part of the [midwest](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States) 




 Personally I would consider Ohio part of the Midwest  




 Gas taxes are used to fund infrastructure projects like roads   bridges. The federal gas tax hasn't been raised in 20 years and because of that funds are getting harder to come by. With the chances of a federal gas tax increase being almost 0, states are looking at the possibility of raising gas taxes on their own. The low price of gas at the moment makes it more palatable to raise the tax now than it was when oil was $100 a barrel.  




 I'd feel like I was selling my sole if I worked there 




 Well I checked the front page and second page and didn't see it there. I can't help it if 2 different websites have the same article and title.

 Fox never ~~learns~~ cares  




 Fellow American here and I totally agree with you. Before going to France  all I heard about were how rude the French were. I personally never experienced that. Granted the school group I was with stayed in more of the touristy areas so there were more english speakers (and one could argue that they were putting on happy faces for tourists). However there were a few times that we were not in tourist areas.  The locals may not have spoken much english but we made the effort to speak French when ordering something or asking questions which they seemed to appreciate.   




 Don't fell bad. It was bought by Rupert Murdoch the guy who owns Fox News.  




 I would have changed the headline to make it more clear but r/nottheonion is SUPER strict about changing titles

 I guess the rumors a month ago about a souring relationship between Whittingham and the AD were either false or resolved  




 Am I the only one here who think that this is wrong and that Penn St should not have the wins restored. I'm sick and tired of Penn St and Paterno fans acting like they were the victims here. The victims were the KIDS that Sandusky RAPED while Penn St turned a blind eye. Did the NCAA overstep? Possibly but guess what the NCAA makes up the rules as they go along. The NCAA is a dick to everyone (just look at USC) why should Penn St get special treatment when everyone else is punished to the fullest extent. 




 Did they learn nothing from Jurassic Park 




 My guess is something by either Fall Out Boy (again), Maroon 5, Katy Perry, Taylor Swift, or Drake. Wild card would be Lady Gaga or Lorde (doubtful though)  




 never trust ANYTHING that the GOP puts forward as a plan/alternative  




 FUCK THESE ASSHOLES  




 Of course, introduce bills that have no chance of becoming law so that the GOP can focus all energy on that instead of things like tax and immigration reform

 It's weird seeing the US without sunglasses  




 excuse my ignorance but can you explain the poster in the background  




 I assume you mean insects not incest :) 

I think insects is self explanatory. I DON'T LIKE BUGS. Orcas..... I don't know why I don't like them. Maybe I'm just more of a fur guy and I have a hard time imagining them as anthros - same with birds probably. (though I did warm up to reptiles so who knows maybe I'll warm up to them as well)  




 Canines all the way. I'm just a dog person so I guess thats why I chose them (I have 2 fursonas a husky and a beagle). Others that I like are foxes, felines, otters, bears, and horses. Ones I don't really care for are birds, dolphins, pigs, insects, and orcas. I used to have a thing against dragons and reptiles but I'm slowly warming up to them.  




 I didn't know fish could be such dicks  




 My first year here as well. I really got into the game threads towards the end of the season and now it's like I can't watch a game without it. It makes watch football (especially bad football) more fun.

 I'm talking about the fact that they put it in the headline. It's fine if they mentioned his party affiliation in the article but no they had to mention he was a Democrat in the headline because they are Fox News. If the head line just said "Politician Wins Special Election From Jail" it would have accomplished the same effect of getting someone to click the article.  




 you mean geckos  




 What a bunch of cowards. Even USA Today, a newspaper that avoids controversy like the plague (seriously their editorial board leans loosely left but they let right wingers publish rebuttals all the time to give the appearance of impartiality) and the most vanilla newspaper I can think of, published the cartoons http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2015/01/12/hayat-boumeddiene-amedy-couilbaly-paris-terror-attacks/21621219/ 




 http://www.themoscowtimes.com/opinion/article/russia-is-not-charlie/514369.html 




 Of course Fox News needs to mention that it's a former Democrat.  




 I didn't say it was a bad thing. I'm using that as an example as to how USA Today avoids controversy.  I'm just saying that it's sad that the McPaper that is USA Today has more balls than Sky News

 You would miss Fox Sports 1   2, Pac 12 network, Big Ten network, CBS Sports Network. You would also miss any regional sports network in your area, going by your Umass flair you would miss NESN and CSN New England. Out of all of these the only networks listed here with "good" games would be FS1 and the Pac12 and B1G networks (which you already said you don't get). The RSN and CBSSN have some games but I think you can afford to not have them as it's usually lower tier games  




 let's be real if fox news was around at the time they would be defending the racists as trying to stop "traditional America" from being destroyed by the evil federal government and "activist judges"

 I'm very uneasy about this plan. Seems like it's giving the state and the governor too much power.  




 As I told the other person My comment wasn't directed at funding SC State. It was aimed at the fact that /u/SCRx seemed to imply that the state of SC struggles to fund all of it's public universities because of the fact that the state doesn't bring in much money from its low taxes. So I proposed the crazy idea of raising taxes to fund education in general, not SC State.

 Today 5 more counties started offering gay marriage licenses after not doing so yesterday. 

Also it sounds like the governor has a sound head on his shoulders (never thought I would say that of an Alabama politician). 
It is important for people across the country to know that the governor of Alabama today is not the governor of Alabama 50 years ago. 

**and**

I dont want Alabama to be seen as it was 50 years ago when a federal law was defied. Im not going to do that, Im trying to move this state forward.

Of note: It is the 50th anniversary of the March on Selma in about 3 weeks, I think this is fresh on his and other Alabamans minds right now.

 I didn't speak to him but a saw Jerry Springer a few rows ahead of me at a Cubs game. Same with Shaq saw him on the sidelines of the chick-fil-a bowl a few years back. I did however say hello once to congressman John Lewis of Atlanta once as I passed him in the airport.

 Also top voted comment on the article is as follows 


**Thomas:**
I walked into his chambers and could feel his steely eyes staring me down. His imposing figure loomed over me as I pressed my back against the wall. Roy dropped his judicial robes to the floor to reveal his well maintained body in all of its glory. His firm member showed a passion. It betrayed by his stone faced expression.
"I always wondered if you wore anything while you were on the bench..." I whispered.
"Shut up" Roy said as he advanced. He grabbed my shoulders forcefully and spun me around, bending me over his large mahogany desk. He drove himself into me from behind causing me to help slightly as I gripped the papers on his desk, moving them from the orderly piles there to be clenched in a fit of pain and passion.
"Oh, Roy!" I called out. "Shut up, Tommy" he insisted through gritted teeth.
Such was my first time.

**Response from Gary:** 
pervert

**Thomas reply:** 
Just when I thought my body could take no more, as I gasped and panted on the verge of collapse, Gary came in wearing a tight, wet T-shirt with a grin on his face.
"No, I can't..."I sputtered.
"You can." Roy said firmly.
"And you will." Gary said.
I lay back, ready to take whatever fate had brought me.
It was like kissing God.

**Gary again:** 
I take great satisfaction in knowing Hell is in your future.

**Thomas reply:**
"I take great satisfaction in knowing Hell is in your future." Gary said as he forced himself into my mouth. He arched his back as he did so before looking back down to me. "Now accept thy Lord..."
 




 this is fucking awesome  




 how do I do that?  




 You don't have to click the link, the headline is all you really need.  




 yes I know it's a christian site but I wanted to share the bigotry/crazy

edit: For those that don't want to give the site clicks the headline is all you really need, also he said this on his facebook page so this is not an "official" order yet. It should also be noted the the governor said yesterday that he would not seek charges against judges who issue marriage licenses to gay couples. So once again Moore is alone in this fight.

 Best quote from the article:
Asked if he believes a transgender woman is a woman, Artiles said, I am not going to get into that. I have not spent much time thinking about that.

So clearly, he is the foremost authority to author a bill specifically about that subject

 I live in the Atlanta area. Mom has no interest in her school's team (Clemson) and Dad is an extremely jaded UVA fan because of their struggles over the last 15 years so it was hard for me to be a fan of either of them because I was never exposed to them when I was young. So I just latched onto the two big schools here. 




 I know :D 




 I really like airports as well!! I like just exploring the place and just taking in the sheer size of the place. I also like watching planes move about and seeing the organized chaos of it all.  




 I hate beer and sweet tea. I can't stand coffee unless its loaded with cream, sweetener, or flavoring (or one of those pricey fancy Starbucks drinks). Also we recently got a Cookout and I don't see what all the hype is about, it tastes shitty to me (with exception to the milkshakes). And while I'm at it Chick-fil-A is just average fast food, people around here treat it like gospel

 I personally am not that much of a beer drinker - or really alcohol drinker to be honest - and have a negative opinion of alcohol in general because my mother is an alcoholic so I don't drink much of the stuff. Of course it helps I've never really found a "real" alcohol product that I liked (the only alcohol that I like are mixed drinks - daiquiris and the like - and Bailey's )  




 I'm still baffled that ALA-FUCKING-BAMA beat Georgia in getting gay marriage

 I haven't been to that many games involving my teams, the worst experience that I can remember having is at the peach bowl (it was either 2002 or 2004). We live in the Atlanta area and my dad gets tickets through work every year to the game. So we usually don't have a stake in either team. We had some extra tickets and their was this family of Tennessee fans that needed tickets. My mom was like "oh they look like a nice clean cut family, why don't we sell our extra tickets to them". We did and they were so thankful, get to are seats in the Dome and they are right next to us. Well the moment the game starts these people turn into the most obnoxious drunk fans I have ever experienced. They were shouting so much that the people in front of us had to ask them to shut up because they were shouting right into their ears. The last straw was when the wife spilt beer on the guy in front of her, security was called and they were escorted out. We have never sold extra tickets to anyone since.  




 I'm not trying to trivialize the issue, what I'm criticizing is that the NFL is all of a sudden caring about this issue and saying that they are going to do more and donate money to charities. When in reality  they are spending so little on domestic violence considering they make $10 billon a year. I'm also criticizing the fact that they partnered with NOmore, an organization that is not a nonprofit and is completely fake seeming to only be for branding http://deadspin.com/do-the-nfls-anti-domestic-violence-initiatives-actually-1682681513

But people see things differently so I can see where you are coming from 




 I don't follow CBB that much, did your team regress or something?  




 I don't think it was an entirely bad idea, it may have just been poor execution (pardon the pun). I think the idea is that instead of promoting their product they are promoting household safety, like the Always commercial isn't promoting their product but treating women with dignity and not ostracizing women/girls.

 So is everyone watching the game by themselves or are you the guy amongst your friends with a laptop/phone in your lap?

 Holy shit its the 4th quarter!! This game was fast  




 especially sense Mila Kunis isn't going to be in the sequal  




 E! pumping out shit as usual it looks like  




 what was that?  




 I'm in Rome  




 people who drink budweiser don't drink it because "they like to drink beer" they do it because they are either too cheap or don't know what good beer is  




 they're bringing Heros back?  




 a toenail fungus commercial, really?  




 for me it's that one, the Fiat one, and clash of clans

 I got a Carolina panther player helping a girl eat her brussel sprouts and then saying that he uses CPI security to keep his family safe, where do you live? If scientology is popular in the area that might explain it  
 




 I hate the NFL mandatory domestic violence commercials because it screams a PR move after the Ray Rice mess
