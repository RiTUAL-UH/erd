 Awesome! thanks for the info! 




 I am looking for the telescope part for my K101 Mod. Long story short, silly me shredded the inside wall where my RBA screws in. Any ideas on where to get a new piece? Any help at all would be great! 




 Thank you for calling Lapras Prince Air the Avatar and not fucking Air Jordan. What kind of a damn nickname is Air Jordan. Stupid. 




 Laughed way too hard at this 




 AMAZING. Now I have to rewatch some of the old episodes to reminisce, i am so excited

 You are right it does have 10 legs. Just a bit of background info, I was on my deck smoking a cig and I happened to spy a black spot on the ground. Came across this god forsaken creature. 









 Could not stop laughing. Bravo

 COMPROMISE. Seriously, it's key. You'll never get anywhere if you two can't come up with some sort of middle ground during an argument. Sure you'll have your fights and fits of rage regardless, but at some point you both need to come to some sort of an agreement that benefits the both of you. That being said, don't be a complete push over either and let her have everything. Make sure you're coming out with something as well.

Another huge thing is trust. You need to have the utmost trust and respect for this person. She needs to be your best friend. I know it sounds cheesy, but it's the truth. You need to be able to trust her to go and do whatever she pleases. And vise versa, same goes for her, she needs to be able to trust you too. 

If you have any doubts about this person at all, then forget it. Don't plan on it being a long lasting relationship if this isn't what you want for the rest of your life. Don't settle for anything less then the best in your eyes. 

Most of all, have fun with it. You'll learn knew things about her everyday (again cheesy, I know sorry). 

Hope this helps a bit! May not be exactly what you're looking for, but it's what I've learned over the years! 




 Pretty random, but I was driving to school in upstate New York and while on my way I saw this morbidly obese child skip around his yard. When he came full circle around the yard he met up with his grandmother and started to frantically beat her in public. I wasn't sure whether to stop or keep going.  




 Wow, great eye! That is Highland Light! I can't personally say I've ever been there myself. What a coincidence though! I'd love to see how yours came out! 




 It is a very, very hard decision. You'll find the one that speaks out to you though. There are so many around the world, so many to choose from. Just take your time, that's all! 




 Thank you for the question! My family and I have always vacationed in the Cape, ever since I was little. The beach and lighthouse theme has been a huge part of my life, we have pictures of lighthouses everywhere at home. That was my main inspiration for the piece. The symbolism of guidance and light were also pretty huge to me. That lighthouse specifically was just because I really appreciated the design!  









 You're welcome! 




 Very beautiful place.
