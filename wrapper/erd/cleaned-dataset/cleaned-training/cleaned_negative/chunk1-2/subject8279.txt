 Then dumb laws should be thrown out. Florida it is illegal to wear a mumu. I know other states have dumb laws that haven't been removed but are not enforced. This is obviously an attack on the Obama administration and political theater. Yes we should enforce laws but cherry picking just marijuana because it is the "hot" topic in the news is a little....... #icouldbewrong #whatdoiknow 




 So they block a bill that would help veterans because they want to stir up some shit that could potentially send kids to war again. Hmmmmmm...

Not enough blood? 




 Went to Iraq in 03 and 04. now that the dust has settled, a day doesn't go by that I realize how they used me for something other than what I thought I was fighting for. I was young and naive, I hope the guys out there are at least better informed.  









 I took a mysticism class in college and my professor made us read the Tao of Pooh. Simple read.

 Take all the legal advice everyone is recommending. A lawyer is a must here. From a father's POV, if that IS your kid, then man up quick and take responsibility. The kid is going to NEED a father in their life who is there for them REGARDLESS of what adult problems happened along the way. It's going to be ok man. Whatever happens, have integrity, take responsibility, and keep your chin up. Judging from what you have already posted, you seem to head strong.
