 Phew. I thought I was the only one who still had no idea what to do.

I love all the albums, but I can listen to this one over and over no problems 




 Same! Death related stuff intrigues me. I'll be alright reading up on murders and stuff.. but actally being in graveyards and near corpses.. Nope.

I am getting better with graveyards though. But I did have to sort of.. blank out for a funeral when the coffin ws being lowered. I think I  drifted off until I was tapped on the shoulder. 




 Serious?!

Oh yes! I'm headed up to Newcastle for the work's Christmas Do. I shall be there and I shall scarf the pasties in my hotel room while reasonably sozzled. 




 Sausage, Bean and Cheese.

they're always sold out when I go. :( Not had one for aaaaaaaaaages. 




 Graveyards and corpses. I actually turned and power walked out of a chapel of rest before my Nan's funeral. In my head I was all **"NOPENOPENOPENOPE"**

 I get anxious to fuck when going visiting my Grandad/Nan's grave (Buried together) For a while, I used to just sit in the car while my Mum/dad/siter went to visit.

I don't really even know what it is. The fact that there's hundreds of dead bodies 6 feet below me is enough to freak me out.

 Apprentice here:

I was taken on at 17 and I'm fortunate that they started me off at Minimum wage (at the time - 4.50 an hour) but the staff turnover for the department I was in was insane. Apparently, I lasted the longest (2 1/2 years) before moving department because the whole thing was just soul sucking, boring and depressing

(I was in the IT preparing area. Computers on the DSA)

Shifted into the warehouse, but still working (I think. My NVQ provider still hasn't got back to me.) on NVQ Level 3 IT Practitioner.

It's good for experience and for fresh out of school kids, but for the most part, you're an intern. Everything gets dropped onto you, because you're fresh meat. 
 




 I thought it was quite a good book, may just be the rose tinted glasses talking though. I'll have to pick it up again. 




 Was forced to read (and watch!) Holes back in year 8 (Age 12, around 2002) Actually kinda liked it. 




 My brain can't handle this

Oh god.

I need to get high one day. I'd come up with some crazy shit.
 




 So I went outside earlier, and looked up. I could have sworn I was too close to the city to see stars, but there they were. 

I can't remember the last time I just stood there in the cold, looking up at them. Must have been during school. And that was at least 6 years ago now. Probably more.

It's a beautiful thing - looking up at night. 

All those stars. Each one has other planets, some possibly even holding life. Hey, for all I know, there's intergalactic transport passing by right now. Not making contact for some crazy law where they're not allowed to make contact or something.

I just stood there for 20 minutes. Mind temporarily blown.. And I'm not even high!

I sent one of my snackexchange buddies some cadbury's chocolate bars (all the types - Standard/Fruit+nut/turkish delight/Caramel) and they seemed to go down well.

also, Wispas! Wispa gold, too, if you can spot them - I saw one the other day at the garage near my place. 




 Yah, EVE online. 

And thanks for the nostalgiaspaz. Not played Kingdom Hearts in forever. 




 B-but, I'm not evil!

I'm kinda the opposite. I've had a decently structured fantasy scenario and story in my head for years, and now I've had this insane idea with a Sci-fi story, it's gonna be so fun to write. :D 




 Oh damn! What area of Manchester were you in? I'm going to Hazard a guess at Salford. That place is scary when it's dark. :( 




 I had it when I was in the states 7 years ago. I had some kind of chicken soft taco thingy. It was alright, actually. I didn't try an actual hard shell taco though, I'll have to give it a try. 




 Yep! I posted an update, and I got a creepy as fuck story from there about 2 weeks ago.

 It's not a massive troll. Well, if it is - I've been had! Still love the show, though. 




 Where'd you get it?! Wouldn't mind one for mine. 




 You get anything back? Curious to hear his stories either way. xP 




 I get the feeling I'll be listening to a lot of Electronic music while writing. Mainly Pendulum. 

Might put EVE on and let the music go by. 




 Ahh, the good ol' sneaky creeper.

 Posted on r/dogs a while back, but thought It'd be cool to see here too. 

I was lucky with this picture! I can never get him to sit still long enough for a good one. 









 At first, I was going to do a generic fantasy - save the world kind of story, but then I had this insane idea.

It'd be a crime story, which'll throw itself into a fantasy-esque ending, but set in space.  It only hit me a few hours ago, so I'm still working out the details and stuff, but I'm super excited! 




 Hell, I'm stuck between making it a Sci-fi, or a fantasy novel.

Might go out on a limb and freakishly combine them. 




 I can only imagine the damage if you're stood next to him and he decided to shout something.

 Good idea! I shall tag all, too. 




 Let me know if this is the place he comes to. If it's him I hear creeping around in the dark when I'm walking the dog, he's made me concerned for my safety while I'm there! xD 




 Adlington ain't too far out from Bolton.

To be precise, it's Moses Gate Country Park, and it's at the bottom end, near the cricket club. If he's been before, he'll know what I'm on about. :P

 Yup! This hut is between Bolton, Farnworth and Little Lever

 Still at work at the moment, but heading home in about an hour and half.

Just for clarification: There's no pics of the man himself - just of the hut. 

They're old reddit posts, from about 5 months ago, but I got one the other day showing its current state.

Here's the old reddit post until I get home and get the new pic uploaded. :) [Clicky!](http://www.reddit.com/r/creepy/comments/h63l7/update_to_bricked_up_doorway_album_inside/) 




 Will do when I get back from work. Just woke up and I overslept. :( 




 Yeah, I live nearby. About a 10 minute drive.

I'm not sure on the history, all I know is that the area used to be a landfill, and the hut he was near was a sewage control 




 'taters.

Poh-tay-toh. 




 I get weird shit like this happening to me all the time. Usually, I'm at home when stuff decides to come out and play, but last night, it picked the perfect moment to scare the living bejeezus out of me.

The darker nights are rolling in sooner each night, and last night - it caught me totally off guard.

I'd been walking the dog down a reclaimed landfill site, and up until recently, it had been perfectly light enough to take a nice brisk walk up and down the entire length of the area (a good 3 miles or so.) But last night, the darkness got there before I did. 

I'm too stubborn to call it off and go walk on a nice lit pathway with the dog. So I pulled out my torch and set off walking.

This pathway is completely covered by trees. Only letting cracks of light in between the leaves. It gives off a very creepy atmosphere.  It was a very cloudy night, anyway. Not much bright moonlight to go by.

Anyway, I'm going off the point here. I'm walking along this big long dirt path, and I can hear rustling in the trees on either side of me. My dog isn't stopping to check - so I assume it's probably some little squirrels or something. In retrospect, what the hell made me think squirrels would roam at night? 

So I'm a little edgy, but the dog doesn't seem to care, so I carry on.

I'm about a mile into the walk, and I approach what I've dubbed "The Creepy Hut."

This creepy looking building is an old sewage control building. The old iron door is still attached, but the doorway behind it is bricked up. the old brickwork a much darker, redder colour than the freshly placed doorblock bricks.
During the summer, the plant life around it goes wild and obscures it from view, ivy growing on its old roof- hanging off the edges, and grass almost as tall as me surrounding it.

But it's just starting to get into autumn, and the grass is wilting, and the ivy is getting brown.  The place reeks of rotting stuff all year round, but today the stench seemed awfully stronger than usual. 

I covered my face with my coat, shone my torch over the old hut and froze.

There was a person in front of the old iron door. He was slouched, slightly. Looking like he was breathing heavily. Or laughing. I wasn't sure - I was too far away.

My dog had seen this, and he'd also stopped dead in his tracks, staring at the strange man in front of the door. His ears were high, tail curled upwards.

The man slowly started turning around. I aimed the torch at his torso, so that the light would slightly illuminate his face. Don't want to blind him!

Bad idea. His face was lit up sort of like when you used to shine the torch under your chin at camp, telling spooky stories. Except this time the man's face was half rotted. He had the shit-eating grin spread right across his face. He slammed this big iron door shut with his left arm, and I swear it took a brick or two from the bricked up doorway with it. 

(Note: This door is heavy as hell. I tried moving it a few months back after taking some pictures of the place, and it was very hard to move, even with all 220lbs of me behind it.)

I just turned back towards the car and ran. Dog had the same idea - He barrelled past me, barking his head off. I didn't want to turn around and see what the man was doing, but curiosity got the better of me. I quickly turned and began backpedalling, and he was just stood where I was - on the pathway. I could see his shape in the limited moonlight, Hunched over.

That was it. I ran the mile back to the car, unlocked it on the run, opened the door, threw myself in and locked it behind me. Turned the engine and lights on, and turned the car to face where I had come from. The high beams on my car headlights weren't enough to pierce all the way through the trees, but I would at least be able to see him coming. Nothing. 

The Dog had barrelled into the car right beside me, so I just took off home.

I swear he was stood at the gate to the car park on my way out. Waving. Like he'd hoped I'd come back soon.

No chance, mate.

I have pictures of both outside and inside this place if anyone wants them

 I can't even comprehend.

WHAT ARE YOU GUYS THINKING 




 You ain't no Boltoner! :I Everyone I've ever known says Breakfast, Dinner, Tea. 




 Oi! 




 That just sounds weird. 




 It's a barm, you fools! 




 Indeed. You always hear of "This is the new MMO - it will surely kill WoW this time!" 

Rather than attempting to just usurp WoW off the MMO Throne, it'd be cool if the devs could try and concentrate on an original concept for an MMO, rather than the run of the mill 3rd person action-y RPG.

It works, but sometimes you just need something new. And with everyone developing these kind of games, there's not that much difference between the lot of them. 

Makes the whole market stale. 




 Yeah, I dunno either. [](/ppshrug) 









 Hey.

 Hi Swimmit!

I crashed my car about a week and a half ago, and I'm currently suffering from whiplash, a sprained wrist, and a bad back.

It's easing off a little bit, and the pain only hits me bad when I lean over, or move my wrist a little too suddenly (That's with my painkillers, though)

Is there any kind of swimming technique I could use to sort of get back in the water, or would you guys advise staying out for a few more weeks? I miss having my after work swim. :(  









 Little late on the posting, but hey.

There were about 15 of us in Birmingham city centre on saturday. We invaded a pub, talked (quite loudly) and received ponies. 

Then we went on a march to somewhere, which involved walking past a big church while playing Pony music through an iPod dock speaker. That was kinda weird.

Then we went through the city shopping centre, waving a flag and singing Winter Wrap Up. That was kinda surreal.

Then we found a shop which sold pony merch, and we acquired more pony.

In short..

[](/soawesome) BEST. DAY. EVER 




 I don't get it. You're toeing the line as it is by driving with no insurance, yet you drive like a lunatic.

You drove down the wrong side of a road, leading into a junction, then you pull out of said junction (It had Give Way signs!) without looking while I'm coming down the main road. Smashy.

I've got a burn up my left arm, a big-ass cut up my left arm and now I think the whiplash is deciding to make itself known. Shoulders and back are achey, and my neck hurts to turn. I thought I was having a heart attack on scene, the airbag went off right into my chest and the pain wouldn't go for about 5 minutes.

Luckily (unfortunately for the company I work for, though) I was working at the time and I was using a van. My little car wouldn't have stood a chance and I might have been seriously injured now. 




 This happened last night, so I can remember pretty much everything in vivid detail. I've probably had about 3 hours sleep.

It was a relatively normal day. I'd gotten back from walking the dog a few hours ago. I walk him on the site of an old landfill, now cleaned up and is a popular horse riding trail. I usually head off the path after heading past an old and abandoned sewage control building, as to not disturb any riders with my very excitable Border Collie.

I was walking among the trees, alone, when I heard the fallen branches behind me snapping, like someone was walking on them. I turned around expecting to see someone walking behind me - there was no-one there. 

Putting it down to my imagination, I carried on walking along the woods. The sounds continued all the way along the woods, only stopping when the ground cleared up.  I thought nothing of it, until last night.

It didn't start off so bad, just the odd footstep here or there. I live in a old house, creaks are expected. But then 1am happened. My door (which is kinda sturdy) was closed. The handle turned and it flung open, slamming into the desk I was sat at. 

Expecting to see my mischievous little sister there, I stood up and poked my head out of the door. 

*"What'd you do--"* 

There was no-one there.  The floor outside my room is creaky, I'd have heard her running off. I shook my head, closed my door - locked it - and carried on with what I was doing.

about 10 minutes later, I was about to grab my glass and take a drink. It slid along the desk, away from me. I stared at it for a second or two, wondering if my mind is just seriously messing with me.  Then it just fell over. 

I'd had it with my room, I was going to go downstairs to watch a bit of TV, and hang out with my dog.  I got downstairs and he was sat right at the door to the stairs, whining quietly. He saw me open the door and wagged his tail furiously. He's normally sleeping on the rug at this time. He must have heard the glass fall over and got spooked.

I eventually ended up asleep on the couch around 3am, BBC news playing quietly in the background, but my dog was still staring at the stairs door.

It was about 5:30am when I woke up. I cursed myself for falling asleep on the couch when there was a perfectly good bed upstairs. I turned around and someone was stood there. At first, I thought it was my mum, coming to check on me, after a few seconds on refocusing it was my Nan. 

My still half-asleep brain relaxed a little - then it hit me - my Nan had been dead for 3 months - She died in July. I faced both my phobias in one day to attend the funeral of the woman who had cared for me all my life.

I freaked out. I sat up, and threw myself over the arm of the couch. Running into the kitchen, I heard scrambling right behind me. I opened the knife drawer and pulled one out and switched to a defensive position.  

It was just my dog following me frantically into the kitchen whimpering and whining.  I threw some water over my face from the sink and slowly popped my head around the corner, back into the living room. No-one there. I got a torch from the back room and used it to navigate my back up to my bedroom.

(Woah, that was long. That's what happened to me last night.)

 I'm going to a funeral in a week, and I have this horrible, overpowering fear of graveyards. This is the first funeral I've ever been to, and I don't want to have a mental breakdown on the graveside.

Would be much appreciated if you could get me one! 



















 Hey all! This is my second story on here. I have a few more, completely nonrelated to each other. I might post them if I can remember the details. Anyway, here goes;

I was 18, I'd passed my driving test about 6 months ago, and we were in the city, playing video games at the Gamerbase, in Manchester, under the HMV.  It was about 10:30 when we left the place, and started the walk back to the car. 

It was an unremarkable walk, nothing to report, just me and my friends talking about whatever came to mind. Mostly video games.

We got to the car, and the place was empty. Of course, it was 11pm on a sunday night, there won't be too many people about. We got in the car and set out.

We must have hit the East Lancs road about 11:15. We're driving down the road, still talking. I was concentrating on the road. I was still a newbie after all.

The exit for Bolton was coming up, I took it and started speeding up on the motorway. I hit 60MPH on the long straight road. I saw a small movement in the distance. A low hanging tree brance, maybe. I carried on.

Suddenly, a young girl dashed out and lept over the safety barrier. I slammed the brakes, but I couldn't stop in time, there wasn't a chance. 

Her legs buckled from the bumper hitting her. 

Her side hit the bonnet, I saw her body twist, and her face slammed into my windshield. I don't think I've been any closer to losing my mind than I did at that moment. Her face was crushed against the hard glass. 

But she had this... Grin which shook my spine like an earthquake. I was so very tempted to just leap out of my car right at that moment. I kept my cool, and got the car to a stop. (albeit, in the middle of the road, but still)

I opened my door and lunged out of the car and took off up the road to help the person I'd just mowed down. My friends scrambled into action, They thought I'd lost it and chased me up to road to stop me. 2 stayed behind to push the car into the hard shoulder.

I was stunned. I only ran a few meters before stopping. There was nothing there. No body, no blood. Only my skid marks in the road. 

I was so certain of what I saw. My friends took me back to the car and we sat outside it for a while. My car was clean. No blood, no dents, no cracked windows. 

Nothing.  

I was certain for days I had gone mad.

It had absolutely lashed it down with rain last night, so I was lucky I didn't drop my phone (Yeah, my phone has a 12Megapixel camera in it) with the amount of slipping I was doing.
On the approach, it absolutely reeked of rotting stuff. I can't pin it, it was just unholy and had to cover my face, otherwise I'd have emptied my lunch all over the wall.

I took two pictures of the interior and started getting the serious heebie-jeebies, and the smell was starting to penetrate of waterproof coat, so I hightailed it outta there.

Enjoy!

(Sorry for the slight confusion. I messed up with my postings.) 














 I played pretty seriously back in WotLK, and participated in a realm second Lich King Heroic 10 Man.

Since Cataclysm's release, I've stepped back a little bit and not played as seriously. I've had a lot of jip from guild members and been branded as if I'm in for the loot.

This is by no means a description of me. I'm far from it.

I play the game as what it's meant to be. A Game. I don't care for loot, or who goes into raids instead of me - I know what it's like to be a raid leader, it's a pain in the arse to find a right setup.

I like to Roleplay, but by no means is it a requirement for me. I'm willing to transfer to any realm on the EU rack. 

[Here's](http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/character/nagrand/zeifer/simple) my main character - a hunter - on the armoury. 

I will be transferring my level 43 hunter over, though. I still have a few friends on my current server and I wouldn't like to lose most contact with them. (I'm currently on Nagrand EU)

I will be able to level this up in a week or 2, though.

I would prefer Horde too, so I wouldn't have to cough up for a Faction Transfer also.

I know it's a long shot, but I hope to hear back from interested people. :) 









 Just shortlisting places I can go for a holiday that's a bit Far-Flung from the UK.

What kind of things is there I can do that a little off the beaten track?

I've had a look around the Canada tourism sites, just wondering if there's much else that could be of interest!

Edit: Derp. Typos. 














 First nosleep post. I've had a couple of freaky experiences where I live right now, I'm on a lunch break at work atm, so I've only got the time for one, so here goes. :)

It was a warm summer night. Unusually warm for northern england, even in the middle of summer.

I was sleeping with no covers over me, just wearing my boxer shorts.

I must have woke up around 3am, lying on my side, greeted by the sight of my black wallpaper. I sighed heavily, knowing I'm not going to be able to fall back asleep now. Hah! If only I knew!

I slowly turned onto my back, to face the roof. I expected to see my Alchemy Gothic "Devil take the Wyrm" poster right above me. What I saw instead curdled my blood, yet I couldn't bring myself to do anything.

A disembodied head, gnarled features. Missing an eye. His other eye, bright red staring right back at me.

He grinned. His teeth (those which were left, anyway) were a horrible shade of yellow. 

The light coming from the side of me illuminated his face with a pale blue glow. I slept that night with the curtains open, I regretted it right at that moment, it made everything so much spookier.

Time seemed to freeze for what felt like an eternity. I couldn't move, it was like he had me pinned down.

And then he vanished.

I heard a car squeal its brakes in the distance, then an engine roar.

I didn't sleep for days afterward, fearing he would visit again when I wasn't expecting him. 














 Hey Doggit!

Just thought I'd ask, as my dog's been doing this for years and I'm curious as to why he'd be doing it;

Everywhere I walk my dog, he'll stop, sniff and start licking something he finds interesting. Be it a plant, the concrete floor, a wall, tree stump. Anything. He doesn't do it at home though, which is strange.

I find this slightly weird, and all google searches only really come up with dogs licking carpets at home.

If it helps any, he's a Border Collie, about 8 years old now. 



















 Was supposed to arrive at work at 8:30am this morning, but never turned up after setting off at 7:50am.

I recieved a text off him at 8:10 saying one word: Adios.
Police have been contacted, and his phone is turned off.

May have gone to the Lincoln area.

If you see him, please contact Greater Manchester Police on 0161 872 5050 quoting the Log number 551, on the 8th March 2011.

About 5'11, medium length hair - brown, has a spidery-like fringe, has a few weeks of beard on him. 
May be wearing Barry Bennett Ltd work shirt, but may have changed clothes.

**Edit: Call off the search! We found him. He was wandering the streets looking completely lost.** 









 When I first talked to one of my friends over there via skype, I heard a little squeal when I said "Hi."
It's almost unnerving, would I be violated if I came over and started talking? 









 I'm 18 stone (252 pounds) and I'm 6 foot 1, I'm 21 and I'm pretty sure I seriously need to start losing weight, fast.

I've taken up Rock Climbing and am doing that once a week, and I'm starting to eat less junk and more healthy stuff.

I'm trying to figure out the best way to exercise that will drop the fat from me in the best way, I'm coming up with Running or Swimming, but I'd thought I'd ask you guys for some help. :)

Edit: Thanks for the tips folks, I gotta dash, break at work is over. I'll read up when I get home!

Edit2: Wow! Thanks for all the replies, I looked through all of them and I appreciate all your advice. :) Thanks a lot! It'll help! 




 I live up north in England. Ask Me Anything! :D 
























 I'm probably a tad late for this one, but I'll post anyway.
Not even my story, either, but my Parents'.

I was 12, and I was staying out at a friends place a few miles away, my sister was also out at her friends just down the street.

Must have been about 11pm, my parents were sat on the sofa downstairs, watching TV and getting ready to go to sleep, when they heard a small thumping upstairs from my room, then nothing.

A minute or two later, down the stairs came 5 or 6 little bouncy balls (You know, the kind which are tiny, choking hazards to children and bounce like motherfuckers)

Now, in order for the bouncies that were in my room to come down the stairs, they'd have to roll out of my room, down a corridor, turn left twice and then bounce down.

Here's the funny bit.

*Mine were still in my room*

 My sister didn't own any. She wasn't awesome enough. 




 I'd imagine just holding it out if your arms are long enough (Or if the chainsaw is shorter), then stabbing yourself with it.

 I'm in Warehousing and Transport. I like the transport side of things, but the warehousing is monotonous and boring as all hell. But it gets stuff shipped countrywide, so I guess I'm doing a good job.

House for my sister and her boyfriend, just to shut 'em up

Buy a bunch of tailored clothes, because I'm sick of wearing Jeans and graphic tees. :( 




 It's been 5 years, but every time your name comes up on the Instant Messenger and we talk, the memories come flooding back.

I don't think I'll ever be fully over you.. It's probably why I'm not even slightly interested in dating still.
 




 Well, as I open the most played playlist on my phone..

 Been using 'em a while now. Very good. Using speedtest.net I get 9MBS. I'm pretty sure we're signed up for the 10MB service, too. 

Though I recall they used to provide a 16MB service, we might have signed up for that. 




 I've never actually been, but I've driven past it a few times when heading to the Academy for a gig.

I'll have to drop in sometime. 




 Coolio55

*cringe*

train_subject8542 is set in stone now, been using this since I was 15. 




 White Russians, or Vodka + Coke. They're only if I've got some money to throw, though.

Otherwise it's just a bottle of cider for me! 




 Pet Puppies seems to work, but I quite like Watch Ponies myself.

[](/hahaha"Because Ponies are awesome.") 




 Aye, could be. I've raid healed on a druid (85) in ToC before, but druids and paladins are totally different. xD 




 I can heal... when I eventually get back to playing properly. 
Might need a little bit of practice in Raid healing, though.

If not, I can powerlevel my hunter.. I have a _lot_ of experience with them 




 Not sure. I saw the stream pause for a few seconds during the Audience Questions, but otherwise it seemed pretty seamless. 




 This took too long to write up.  
[](/twicrazy"Clock...is.. TICKING!") 









 I can't even get back to the proper sign in page now, I've just logged out and I get the e-mail sign up form.

Try signing out of facebook, maybe? I don't have one. 




 I signed up with just my e-mail. There's a small link under the "Sign up with Facebook" button saying "Sign up with e-mail" 




 Totally up for it, but my sister's 18th is the same night. Next time! 




 Underwear by Royal Republic 




 Lots of shit flinging going on in here.

What the fuck, did I go to a school where the kids were _mostly_ normal?

Weirdest kid in our school was a Jehovah's Witness. Liked to poke everyone he met. He came knocking on my door the other day. Poked me in the nose for old times' sake and wandered off. 




 22 in a few weeks here. Full time Warehouser/Van Driver/Techie for 5 years, Engineer's Assistant for a year before that.

I keep the Ponies and IRL seperate. Moreso after my sister spilled the beans on my Pony music listening habits to facebook. Coworkers saw and ribbed me for a few days.  




 When it comes to society breakdown, or invasion - us brits are screwed. xP I wouldn't even know where to begin looking to find a firearm.

I got lots of sharp pointy things. Do they count? (I'm an avid weapon collector. Got various axes, swords and daggers mounted in my room) 




 Sorry. I mean I'd just forget the doors were smaller, and bash my head on the top of the doorframe.

I type like I talk. :D 




 Hide in the woods. As long as I was quiet about it, I doubt they'd come looking for me. Take a lot of tinned food and see how long I'd last. Sneak out and scavenge shops for more tinned, precooked food.

I'd be a terrible fugitive. 




 I'd say the same, but only if I was a pony myself. Those doors are tiny, I would slip up and twat my head on a door many times.

[](/hahaha"Because Ponies are awesome.") 




 What?! Sweet is outdated?

Fuck. 




 Hell, I still kind of like them. Their new album I can quite happily listen to. I listen to music to fill the day, I don't listen for imperfections, or genius.

It's a band (or a person) who's picked up an instrument, or sang, put it on a CD so I can listen to it.

I'm not gonna give anyone shit for listening to anything.

Haters gonna hate. 




 Could be, though I'm not sure how they'd get in the space between my floor and the kitchen roof.

Hell, how they'd even get in the house is a question in itself, I have a dumb, lovable dog and 2 bastard cats which attack anything that moves. 




 Every single night, about 1am-ish, there's a scratching in my floor. It doesn't wake me up, I just hear it if I'm awake.
 
At first, I thought it was my dog, scratching at something downstairs, but one night, I was downstairs and I heard the scratching above me.

I've been hearing it since I moved in, about 13 years ago. I want to know what it is! 




 [](/derpwizard)I derp'd 
 




 I saw some "Malteaster" chocolates in Mid November. Kinda did a double take at the petrol station I was at. 




 Not sure. Being a site writer on a fansite, I should really know these things.

"Pinkie Pie tries babysitting Cake's twin toddlers but finds it harder than she thought."

back to the subreddit! [](/hahaha) 




 Just wait 'til Saturday. It's gonna be brilliant! [](/ppboring) 




 When I was 14 or something and still used myspace, I believed that the 9/11 terrorist attacks were an inside job.

Yeah - I grew out of that pretty quick. 




 [](/flutteryay) Not all warehousers are assholes. 

I'm a warehouser.  It's all about personal taste. 




 I'll be outside with a giant swizzle straw! [](/party) 




 It's like a great big black hole.
Once you're in, you never leave.

This is not a bad thing [](/hahaha"I wouldn't want to, anyway!") 




 My brain says I should be ashamed, but my heart is currently fist pumping. 




 Well, you've all knocked us Mancs off the top spot.

I'm not sure whether to be ashamed or proud of this. 




 [](/hahaha) Happy New Year from the UK, Everypony! I may had had one too many doughnuts...

[](/punchdrunk) 




 My brain broke even trying to read this.
[](/derp)

I tried 5 times. 




 [](/hahaha"I want to go to the Future!")Maybe in 10 years, when we have some amazing paper.

 




 Currently [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JETHNPLV7Tk).
It'll probably stick for a while too. 




 I have two peices of advice for you. 

Try to avoid Salford at night, and for the love of god, don't mention Scousers unless you're taking the piss out of them. Or Southerners for that matter. 




 Good. Channel that rage.

Right into that there Dragon's neck. 




 Ow! Arrow!
It came from the sky! **IT WAS THE DRAGONBORN!** 




 After wasting weeks and weeks on heroic mode, I started to really dislike "AS YOUR PATHETIC MAGIC BETRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYS YOOOOU"

I was a hunter too, so it didn't even affect me! 




 Yep. Dropped the parents off at my Aunts and I stayed back. With the girls it's shopping and gossip, with the guys, it's football and beer, and there'll be about 10 kids running and screaming.

I just want to chill out and chill with friends, talk shiny things and play video games. 




 The Fire isn't even available here in the UK, I've got the Kindle 4 (non-touch) 




 Slow as in slow to change page? I got the download off EQD and it seems to be running fine!  




 Got my kindle for Christmas too.

[This is going to take a looooong time to read.](http://i.imgur.com/y6KyT.jpg) 




 KFC do breakfasts?
Shit, I've never seen them. What are they offering? 




 I'm not sure. My daft mate left the reciept in from Argos, was 20 or something. Still bloody awesome. I love it, been after one for a while. 




 If you're only 10 minutes away, it's not too bad. Though the campsite has some great craic going on. 




 Download Festival Tickets (:D!) and a laser projector to make pretty patterns on the roof.

 




 Last week, I'd gone to bed quite late, despite having to get up early the next day. The parents and the sister knew I was going to be doing a looooong drive down to London to deliver stuff - rest was vital.

It's 2am. "Can you come pick me up? I'm in Manchester, I don't want to wait for a bus.."

I promptly told her to shove it and went back to sleep. 




 "Dude. Do you wanna go play ball or go for a run or something?"

**"SHIT YEAH"** 




 I love him. Every time I fight him, I always /y "TIMMAY!" back at him. 




 Ooooooh. Yeah, I've been posting a fair bit in the past few days. 




 You do? What did I say or do for you to remember me? D: 




 Recommended, essential reading - I don't care! Gimmie!  




 I masturbated during my grandmother's funeral.

*Well.* 




 I'm not sure if I like bananas.. 




 As a Mancunian - I have no idea.

At least we're winning in something other than football! All we need now is Masturbation as an olympic sport, and we'll be champs. 




  I masturbated during my grandmother's funeral.

How the hell did you manage that..? 




 Fall in your dream. Wake up. Dangling from a rope god know how high up.

Pants wil be shat in. 




 Yes. I was in a LD for just under 2 years, and the times when we met were the best I ever had. I'm in England, she was in Belgium. Nothing like getting tacklehuggedkissed at the train platform. 




 There might be nanobots inside, be careful! We don't want another "Mummy" situation. 




 I have the client downloaded at home, and I made my account last night. I'm just wondering, is there a free trial period?

Also, I'm looking forward to playing. I haven't read much into it, as I signed up and downloaded last night on a whim after seeing a billboard ad on the way home from work 




 I should really get on more.. Steam Sales has me hooked again. Still only at ilvl 365, so I can't queue for LFR yet. 

Soon. 




 serious procrastination. if there's something I need to do, I'll put it off. Everything. Ever.

I should be working now 




 I'm coo' with it. I get back from work and it's a new bunch of games. :D 




 Graham Linehan was tweeting a few links. Caught me hook, line and sinker. 




 not widely used, but try posting this to /r/missingpersons too! 




 [Malukah - The Dragonborn Comes (and Skyrim Main Theme)](http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t rct=j q=malukah source=web cd=2 sqi=2 ved=0CC8QtwIwAQ url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D4z9TdDCWN7g ei=kmvuTuHmDcP08QOloZ2JCg usg=AFQjCNFDtSaSTtBGx8DlZwHNIj0ocdPoaA sig2=m1Ilolbz9jEL-4JH6MUzGw)

Coooool. 




 It's like a horrible car crash. It's horrible, but you gotta look at it. 




 There's a good amount of pony subreddits. A pretty daft amount, now I think about it. 

There's a subreddit for each character, the main sub, the NSFW sub, the sad sub, the stoner pony (stony) sub.. I could go on.

Maybe they're all posting at the same time. 




 There are some of the fans (myself included) who aren't pony nutcases, and I generally keep my pony antics in /r/mylittlepony, but there are always fans who let it leak a bit too much, though. 




 You're makin' that sound like a bad thing, Sugahcube.[](/squintyjack) 




 Aaaw! Why do BC's look so awesome when you put them in a neckerchief? 

I'm going to get one and see if mine will chill with it. 




 Okie-dokie-lokie, I'll drop you a PM with my address. 




 Cool! Do you wish to initiate the mailings, or shall I? 




 I have Skyrim already. :P 




 If it helps any, I'm English and I love visiting historical sites.

Should've said, really: I'd love to travel to far flung places, as well! I might jump in my car and visit a few of the English sites, and I'm definitely going to head to Ireland at some point. I've always wanted to visit Giant's Causeway 




 ISHYGDDT

(I seriously hope you guys don't do this.)
 




 Sure am! I'll drop you a PM with my e-mail 




 Whenever I go to the city centre, I usually park in a little car park just past Salford Central. Just off New Bailey Street, before it becomes Bridge Street

If you've got a satnav, put in Browncross Street. If not, when you go under the bridge with Salford Central, turn left down the side street just after Stephensons. 

Parked there a while back for a few quid, though it's a bit of a walk for the Arena.  




 I didn't get one..

:( 




 Indeed! I'll PM you my e-mail 




 I had a terrible time with Sky. The first month we had, we had fantastic speed, then for about 5 or 6 months after that, the speed we had was abysmal. I was lucky if I could download a 3 or 4 MB file within a few hours

I lost my temper with it so many times I ended up buying a 3G dongle 'til my dad saw sense with it. 




 Nokia.

I fell off the wagon and got an iPhone, then realised my mistake. I'm on my N8 now. Admittedly, Symbian is a pile of balls, but it makes phone calls, sends messages and lets me dick about on Reddit and Google+ just fine. 




 I lived on that for months. Had a horrible comedown. :( I'm a sucker for citrus energy drinks. 




 I think Youtube has issues with popular videos. It might stick at a number for a long time. 

Usually when I check it again a week later or something, It'll be (somewhat) accurate 




 Up for writing to anywhere, really! Get a grasp on how other people live their lives compared to mine.

I'm a bit of a technophile, and I love games and gaming in general. If I'm not working or gaming, I'll probably be lurking on the internet, or in the pub.  




 Unfortunately, I'm on the piss in Newcastle for the work's annual christmas do.

Maybe next time! 




 I have been swayed! I'm going to finish Skyrim tonight (I'm on the last quest for the main story now) and I shall resub tomorrow, maybe. 




 Aye, true. But still. xD I'll finish Skyrim and see if I can get back in the swing of things with my holycow 




 Picking up, huh? :) Might be tempted to resub, though I'm trying to kick my habit of playing games all day every day, and I've still got Skyrim to finish! 




 I was visiting Florida back in '04 and was in Orlando. After hearing many hurricane warnings, we headed back to the hotel (we were on a ground floor outside facing room), closed the windows and put a towel or 5 against the front door.

Slept straight though it. Totally missed it. As ol' blighty never gets any extreme weather, I was kinda gutted 




 At my desk at work. Bolton - England. 

Dullest town in England, I assure you. :P 




 Indeed you may!

[My tattoo of Red XIII's Tattoo](http://i.imgur.com/7qPFO.jpg)

Also, obligatory /r/tattoos subreddit plug. :D 




 Hah. Maybe. :P No rush, though! Don't go crazy on behalf of me. :P 

I'm a little broke at the moment, so I'm cutting back on stuff. WoW being one of them. 




 Fair enough! If you hit 85 before december, drop me a message - I'll come heal a dungeon or two for yous :D 




 I played for a little while - though I've gone off WoW recently. I've got a few days left of gametime, but then my sub runs out. If you're in the 85's, I'll come heal some dungeons for you, see if I still got it. :D 




 My lights are working a-ok, but you just reminded me that one of my Reverse lights are out.

I shall fiddle with it later, thanks for the reminder! :D 




 Not completely finished yet - Still need to get it coloured in.

Paul is an awesome artist, but his waiting list is huuuge! I'll try and get a clearer picture for when it's finished.

the dragon is a personal character of mine. [Jen Philpot](http://jocarra.deviantart.com) was the artist who drew the original picture. Paul modified it a little so it'd fit my arm
