 3rd on burp cloths...but butt wipes are also seemingly ALWAYS in short supply.

Same flair already granted in [/r/Science] (http://www.reddit.com/r/science). 




 Agreed. These bonds between receptor and ligand also have differing association/dissociation constants, meaning the ligand/receptor can be together for varying amounts of time. Some very short, some nearly permanent. This all has to do with the relative associative forces bringing the molecules together, and it's balance with the repulsive forces pulling them apart. Things like electrical charge, simple diffusion, conformational changes in the receptor shape...they all can help push things back apart, and work against the non-covalent bonds that are formed. 




 Capsaicin is a strong activator of a transient receptor potential (TRP) channel called TRPV1. This channel is found on sensory nerves and plays a role in nerve signal conduction. The neat thing about capsaicin is that it is also a strong desensitizer of TRPV1 - so much so that it can actually cause the amount of TRPV1 protein expressed on sensory nerves to decrease for extended periods of time. Less TRPV1 = less sensitivity to capsaicin = less burning-mouth perceived by you. I mean, it's not really "hot"; it's just perceived as such due to activation of TRPV1 channels. No TRPV1 means bland food, no matter how much capsaicin you put in it. 




 Euchre. Well-known in the Midwest US, but otherwise not so much (it seems). Three and 4 player iterations exist.
