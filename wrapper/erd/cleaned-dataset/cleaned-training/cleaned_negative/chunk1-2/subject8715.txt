 White Heat! 




 Everyone hates on it. But you know what? It's motherfucking Turbo Time, so fuck em. 




 "Where am I? Am I still in prison?" "You're in the hospital." "Ta-da..." 




 Jingle All the Way. "That was really a bomb? This is a sick world we're living in with sick people!" 




 Anne and her rules. No walks, no trips to the groomers. In the end, I just snapped. I screamed at her, Anne! Im dying here! It's like we never leave the house! Thank God, these well-dressed German men heard my barking and broke into the attic. Those brave heroes rescued me.

 




 That is a very odd scene that could be read in a variety of ways. Either way, it seems too ambiguous to be definitive. But I do think you can make a pretty strong case for Nick's bisexuality throughout the book. I'll have to keep that in mind when I re-read Gatsby.

Trade Away: Percy Harvin
Receive: Alshon, Reggie Bush

WR and the flex are definitely a problem for me. I left a few players off here because I'm working the waiver wire tomorrow.

I have two flex spots to figure out this week. Candidates are Doug Martin, Bernard Pierce, Kelvin Benjamin, and Greg Jennings.

Pierce had a solid week, but obviously the other three did not... 




 It's a Wonderful Life. It's a beautiful movie and it is one of the few "classic" movies that nearly everyone will watch and love because of its charm.
