 Nice bike! 




 I was never a big fan of Opinels but I gotta say, that is beautiful.  




 If you dont mind me asking, what's with the knives on the bottom row 2, 3 and 4 from the left? 




 I just bought my first Spyderco tenacious about 6 months ago.  They make good stuff. 




 How big is that blade? I love the knife but seems a little to big for every day carry. 




 Its tough but I love the challenge.  




 Down vote this.  I figured it out, I am playing on hardened and I realize I have to press square. 




 I downloaded the game and played though a part of the prolonge and when I get the the alleyway with tommy he glitches out and won't continue forward.  I can't continue on because the infected guy at the end keeps on killing me. 




 That lady was right, that homeless man was beaten up by a group of thugs. 




 Gratuitous.  




 I always preferred Pepsi.  




 Watch the movie "under the skin".  You're welcome.

 Spyderco tenacious.  3.125 inch blade, has a good weight to it feels sturdy and well made just all around a good knife. 




 3rd base line, section 126, row 3. 




 Its like an abusive relationship.  They keep on getting socked in the face but always end up crawling back.  




 I have the same Oliver Winchester knife!!! I have never seen anyone else that has it.  Solid knife.  




 No, the clip cannot be adjusted.  




 Its a great knife.  Feels well made and has a good blade on it. 




 I feel for ya.   




 The Nobleman, I picked it up in a cutlery store for 25 bucks. 









 The scene in Hardball where G-baby got shot and they showed his little coffin.  I lost it that that scene.  




 I have that knife, its a good blade.   




 Win the player-haters ball. 




 I have an '82 cb900c.  When I bought it everything worked great.  The only problems I have is that the engine doesn't re-fill the battery and I had to change the tires as well as break pads.   




 I dare you, I double dare you motherfucker say whore one more God damn time! 




 This is a good sign.  When the arguement is this extreme you can bet that they're scrambling for a reason to continue on.   




 I read a short story once where one of the characters was named "fat boy", it was free so I let it slide.   




 Is this an Xbone exclusive?  




 Do you know why aspirin are white?
Because they work. 




 that phrase takes on a whole new meaning when it comes to Hannibal.   




 Does anyone know what she said? 




 Hannibal.  The entire first season they are winding Will Graham up to become a monster.  




 That guy has a great pair of tits.

 Freedom. 




 I'm throwing my money at the computer but nothing is happening. 




 Kill la kill. 




 I finished madoka magica but I'll check those out! 




 I was the same way man.  Check out kill la kill, first 2 or 3 episodes will seem a bit silly and girly but it quickly rakes a real dark turn. 




 Thank you!  




 I read all of the light novel translations that can be found in the sidebar.  My question is; is there a difference between those translations and the official ones? And how is that different from the progressive? 




 I actually wouldn't mind spending time with the avatar.  As long as I am an earthbender then I'm fine.  




 What is the middle one on the bottom row? 




 Congratulations, that Is officially my new wallpaper for my phone.  That is really good! 




 The struggle is real man.

 Does anyone know when vol.15 will be translated? 




 That's a good album.   









 R.K. Flame has some pretty cool knives. 




 I think Half-life has one of the best story lines in the business.

 That bike looks like a death trap...and I absolutely love it!

 I started reading them about a week ago...I'm already in volume 10.  Read them you won't regret it. 




 Wow. 




 I can understand that.   




 I never saw the appeal for knives like that.  Unless you're Sam Fisher or something they really aren't that practical.
