 The owner just asked me about him just adding Peroni to his mix, which I sort of tut-tutted.  He seems to be genuinely interested in stocking better options than the usual national suspects.  It looks like got cooler space for maybe 24 options.  What do you think? 




























































































































 If this is an RES thing, please advise and I'll submit there.

I'm stuck with a perpetual -1 next to me.  When I try to upvote or downvote myself, it increases the -1 to -2 and -3, but I can get it back to -1. 

I don't know how I did this, but I spent a lot of east coast USA late hours in /r/olympics last week while tipsy.  I think I may have inadvertently tried to upvote a comment I forgot that I had made -- things were moving very fast in say the womens slalom thread.  Maybe I tried upvoting an event thread which were self posts?  

Any idea how to set myself back to neutral?
 












































 You have to hand it to NBC.  They suck but sometimes they don't.

 Could somebody bring me up to date on the locket?  I didn't remember that it had been found much less now being in the hands of Stella.   


















































































































 Yahoo seems to be set up for game by game predictions like an NFL pool.  I think in past WC's I've done pools more like an NCAA basketball bracket where you have to predict the F4 and so on before the tournament begins.  

Any recommendations?  Also, is there a reddit pool?
