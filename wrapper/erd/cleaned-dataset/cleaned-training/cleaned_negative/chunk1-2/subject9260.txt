 I am starting an online business, specializing in playing cards. They are cheap and lightweight, making the prediction of shipping cost problematic.

Would you, as shoppers, be willing to pay a higher shipping cost upfront, and receive a coupon or gift certificate for the difference in return? Doing so, you would have an incentive to return to the shop, and I, as the seller, don't lose money on shipping fees.

Thoughts? Questions? Heated calls for me to go to a different subreddit? I'm up for all of it. 



















 Edits, added info on Key to Laughter. refined info on what the Keys are.

Throughout the season, we have been trying to find the different keys to open the chest, and each episode has been given a strange hook at the end.

I believe that some of these ending *are* the keys to unlock that chest. Specifically, the shining items. The items themselves will be revealed to become the keys once all of them are found.

The Key to Generosity - Rainbow Thread - The key to Generosity is not to give away without thought. You must be willing to see when your generosity is harming others, and be careful not to hurt your relationships.

The Key to Loyalty - Wonderbolt's Badge - The key to Loyalty is to stick with your friends, even if it means giving up something important to you.

The Key to Laughter - Boneless -  The key to Laughter is knowing when to be light-hearted and when to be serious. If they pony you are throwing the party for isn't having fun, then you are doing something wrong.

The others have not been seen yet, but will show themselves in the next few episodes. Each Key will be a mostly ordinary item that is germane to the episode. Each Key will be given by the pony that learned a lesson about the Element, and will representative of both their and the Bearer's personality.

The Key to Kindness - The key to Kindness is to know when that kindness is being wasted. You can still be polite to those that are rude to you, but you must know when to walk away. (Fluttershy's episode will likely involve a conflict between her animals.)

The Key to Honesty - The key to Honesty is to not be afraid to face the truth, no matter how unpleasant. It is one thing to tell a white lie about liking someone's dress, but hiding the truth will generally lead to disaster. (Applejack's episode has been brewing for a long time now, and things will quickly come to a head soon)

The Key to Friendship - The key to Friendship is to love your friends during the best and worst of times. Even when you are angry with them, even when you are sick, even when they do wrong. (Twilight's episode will involve Discord, and will end with the opening of the chest. Twilight will make the revelation that she does not want to harm Discord, because he is still a friend. She will also learn that Chaos, the Element he embodies, is a necessary force in the universe.) 




 The Lee Family history is a complicated one, with unpleasant holes when looking for members outside of the famous family. Everyone wishes their family is relayed to royalty, causing confusion and false stories. 

There is one method I can think of to clear this up, to ask existing Lee's for details of their direct ancestry.

But, is it a good idea to just call them almost randomly and ask for their male lineage?

And is there possibly another way? 









 Important note that I forgot. I mean one that is actually available now, not as a preorder. 









 Are RRR cards seriously being bought for $30-60, or is that just what people are putting them up for and buyers don't buy them? 



















 Victor Tate, arrested and convicted for a crime he didn't commit, serves 18 years hard time when Stabler and Benson find the real perp. Perp confesses, but is killed before he can give his plea in open court.

So, why can't they have Tate released in the interest of justice. Certainly, the testimony of the arresting officer saying that Tate is innocent, based on the admission of guilt from the deceased would be enough for a parole board to consider early release, or the governor to grant a pardon.

Hell, Liv and El have friends in the media, if the Governor said no, They could drum up public support.

There is no reason, legally, to keep him in prison. 




 Woman comes in right at the beginning of the shift, asking for a room on the outside. I tell her we have one and give her the rate.

She pulls out a *massive* wad of one dollar bills and starts going through it.

I tell her, "I'm sorry, I can't take 100 dollars in ones. "

"Look, I'm from the Valley and this is how us Mexicans pay. How many ones **will** you take?"

Her compromise ended up being paying the whole thing in a mix of fives and ones, the whole time giving me a hard time about how Mexicans just don't pay with anything larger than a five, and I (because I am white, But she didn't say it) wouldn't understand that. 


































 At the end of the episode, Twilight is presented with a box by the Tree of Harmony. A box with 6 keyholes. Considering the source of this box, the Keys must be tied to the Elements of Harmony.

So, what are these Keys, and where are they found?

1) Key of Honesty

2) Key of Kindness

3) Key of Laughter

4) Key of Loyalty

5) Key of Generosity

6) Key of Magic

And the final question, What is in the box?

Discuss... 




 Applejack told her to Spike the punch. 














 How many people? I dunno, 1?

Do you want smoking or non-smoking? It doesn't matter.

We have both, which do you want? I dunno...

 We just failed our pool inspection pretty badly, and the inspector told me, personally, that the pool has to be shut down until the issues are fixed.

Issues include locks needing to be fixed on the entrance and machine room, a lack of an emergency phone, no safety shutoff for the spa, a dangerous PH balance... you get the picture.

And my manager (three guesses to his last name) tells me to throw away the hotel copy of the inspection that has my name on it and tell people the pool is open.

What do I do? 




 Really, no answers? 


































 Perhaps one of Granny Smith's siblings was...

wait for it...

Apple Pie. And Pinkie Pie could be their descendant, making her and Applejack 2nd cousins. Because they are close as friends, it would only make sense that they consider each other family.

It would also explain why they were getting along, mostly, in Equestria Girls, despite Sunset Shimmer's attempts to drive everyone apart, and why Pinkie would have had any reason to head Sweet Apple Acres in Magical Mystery Cure.

 ...is when guests accuse me of being racist because I didn't give them everything they wanted.

This guy just now felt like he could check out whenever he personally felt like it because he didn't get into the room early yesterday. Mind you, it easy a busy day that morning, no one was being checked in when he originally came, because none of the rooms were clean. Our normal check in time is 3pm, so all guests that came early were told to come back after three.

We get some rooms ready early (about 2pm), and so we begin checking people in, provided their room was ready, and when my relief came in at 3, I personally got a list of all the rooms that were ready from the housekeepers to start checking people in more quickly.

This morning, after checking out, this jackass accuses me of checking people in with 'preferential treatment' which confused me for a moment until he continued, "I'm sure you only checked white people in early".

That was it for me, after all the nastiness he was spewing that I normally let wash over me (he'd been demanding a late check out for over an hour), I cut him off.

"Don't make this about race, that isn't fair to me and it isn't fair to you."

His response, "No, it's not fair to me."

[](/facehoof) Some people never think about what they're saying.

 In an effort to make sens of the slightly contrived ending, I noticed three important things regarding the Element of Harmony stolen by Sunset Shimmer.

First, that the stolen Element is not the Element of Magic wielded by Twilight Sparkle. Upon her ascension at the end of the third season, the power of the other five Elements merged with the one embedded in the crown to created a single Element.

Second, the people of Canterlot High and the ponies of Equestria are causally linked to one another. While they have different experiences and memories, they each hold the same personalities, abilities, and relationships as their counterparts. Because of this, when Pony!Fluttershy earned the Element of Kindness, Human!Fluttershy was able to wield its power as well. It should be noted that when Twilight's transformation occurred, the other Elements remained intact.

Third, and most important, is that Sunset Shimmer had no way of knowing these previous points. She believed that bringing the Element of Harmony into the human world would give her the power of the Elements in the human world, where she could gather an army to take over Equestria.

*But...*

She had been living in Canterlot High for 2 and a half years. She had to have known that there was no magic working there. So, why would she believe that bringing the crown there would be a worthwhile endeavor? Why not just put the crown on inside the Crystal Empire?

The answer can only be one thing. The Nightmare Force.

For over a thousand years, something has been corrupting powerful individuals in Equestria, and turning them into cruel and evil beings. This force had been defeated by the Elements of Harmony before, possibly twice, depending on when Sunset Shimmer left Equestria, and it may have taken root inside Sunset Shimmer as well.

If it was whispering to her to take the crown away from Equestria, it may have believed that it could take over the Element in the Human World. When Twilight wears the crown before Sunset Shimmer, nothing happens, and when Sunset puts the crown on, she babbles about unlimited power, but the magic takes hold on its own. A Dark Magic, separate from the aura she displayed in the Crystal Empire. The transformation was not caused because Sunset wore the crown. It was because Nightmare did.

Season 4 will be exploring this Nightmare Force in more detail, and the events of this movie may or may not play out with that, but they seem linked.

[](/twibiggrin) But I might be wrong.

 It's become a little of a sore spot for me that I can not seem to trace that branch of the family beyond their arrival on the River. My family always talks about being related to the Lee's of Virginia (Robert E. Lee specifically), but this is a dead end, I fear. 




 I just hope I made the right decision with such a large portion of my paycheck. The delivery time of July 24-26 is acceptable, but $100 is a lot to tie up in speculation. 









 On another sub, the discussion regarding the Labor Theory of Value naturally lead here. Among questions that I have to ask is that if, as the one self-described socialist in the discussion suggested, we as a society were to disallow earnings on capital investment, including giving some of the company's profit to shareholders, what would be used to give investments to new companies?

To be more simple in my phrasing, if I had a sum of money saved up from working, what incentive do I have to loan that money to my neighbor, who wants to make useful products for others?

If I were to give a loan for zero interest, I run all the risk of loss, and have no potential to gain, therefore my only way of gaining is to only utilize my money for my own projects, because I would be a worker and not an investor.

Does this not breed more selfishness? Ironically, the philosophy of selfishness, Objectivism, would encourage investment in others with appropriate thought and care to minimize loss, leading (hopefully) to a better business venture.

I appreciate your taking the time to read this, and would further appreciate an honest answer as to how my thinking is not in line with your philosophy, so I may better understand. 






















































 My theory is a simple one. At some point in the past, Celestia received a prophecy that the newest ruler of Equestria would be someone named a certain way.

**Sunset** *Shimmer*

**Twilight** *Sparkle*

Shining Light Twixt Day and Night

Will Enter Through the Mirror

Friendship's Magic Come to Light

Alone, She Will Appear

Elements Six Will Join the Fight

To Protect the World From Fear

Redemption Favors Over Might

 Is this happening to anyone else?

I got ahead of myself and used the token to buy a free warbird before accepting the mission and now the mission is frozen on the "buy a new ship" objective. Even buying a third ship using mined dilithium didn't help, and it seems like the GMs there don't help out at all.

Will I have to start over? 














  Oh yeah, I was getting excited and got off topic. Let me get back to it. Yeah, I did help my sister yesterday. I convinced my father and let him accept her hobby.

 But you see, I didn't do that to be thanked by her. I didn't do that wanting something in return. I'm not repeating some famous person's line but...

 I just did what I wanted to, the way I wanted to. All selfishly, I just meddled with things.

 As a result, what I obtained is something within myself, and not something I get from another. 









 I am going to begin acting as an SLL gateway. If you wish to use ripple to trade SLL (Second Life Lindens) for BTC or USD for a much lower fee than ViwWoX, I can help.

1) Trust my ripple account ( rwJvwvXz7Tg4KNP29yzqQnciFFL1YCpKUH ) for any arbitrarily large amount of the currency "SLL", you will have to enter that in manually.

2) Connect your account to the Bitstamp gateway for USD and BTC.

3) If you wish to buy SLL, put in a trade, typing in "SLL/BTC" or "SLL/USD" select my address for the SLL issuer, and bitstamp for the other. Liquidity will be initially low, so do not worry about the speed of the trade. It will become faster as trades continue.

4) If you wish to sell SLL, PM me either here on Reddit or on Second Life (train_subject9260.resident), to send the Ripple payment address and set up a time to give the SLL collateral. This amount, minus the 1% deposit fee, will be sent as a Ripple payment immediately on receipt. You may then Sell SLL for USD or BTC using the same method in 3).

5) To withdraw your funds from Ripple in SLL, contact me with your SL username, and the amount you will withdraw. I will give you a transaction number for the payment and send the funds to you for no additional fees.

6) To withdraw in USD or BTC, use the methods described in Bitstamp. Some fees may apply.

Fees collected from this will be used as follows.

1) Upgrading to a premium account to allow land purchase.

2) To buy a plot of land to allow "Face to Face" transactions between Ripplers, allowing for a soft marketplace for buying or selling products for currencies other than SLL.

3) To expand that land to allow for static shops, which will increase SLL holdings within Ripple and facilitate larger trades.

4) To expand into a social gathering point focusing on the Bitcoin and Ripple communities in SL. 














 Who holds the money while it is in ripple? If I set up a gateway, would I be able to take money from my friend, for example, and send him a payment in Ripple?

Would I simply be in possession of his money at that time?

How would I be informed if another gateway withdraws that IOU, so I can send them the money, if necessary?

 And what would stop me from setting my own price to trade from one currency to another? And from that, trade with myself for a higher or lower price than a normal exchange. 




 I thought of a couple ideas to use.

"Lima Bean" - Play when you would be affected by a monster's Bad Stuff that includes Death. You survive instead and gain levels as if you defeated the monster. This can not give you the winning level. No Treasure is gained.

"Reincarnation" - Play when someone would be affected by a monster's Bad Stuff that includes Death. ~~Roll a die. On 4-6,~~ you reincarnate as a member of the opposite sex. Discard all Race/Class/Etc. Cards and replace with the same number starting from the bottom of the Discard Pile.

"Weighted Boots" - -5 Power, -1 Run Away, Every combat you successfully Run Away from while wearing the Boots add add a +1 counter (+2 for Martial Artists) to yourself that is lost on Death., Footwear, Big, 300 Gold

"Neo**nic Nightmare" - -1 Power, Scientific Experiment combines your DNA with a Spider, -4 Arms, No Value

Edit - Removed dice roll from Reincarnation.

Edit - Fix to the Boots 




 There are a total of over $100,000 in USD loan requests on the site, which are used to buy BTC on margin, some of the requests as high as 150% interest.

Because Margin buying is done as a loan, where the buyer can not retrieve the coins, they are purely speculative purchases, and indicate an extreme inflation to the price of the coins themselves.

This is great news for people who are lending money, as the system will not allow the borrowers to default, but this could pose a serious risk to newer purchasers of BTC. If these margin loans were to close position quickly, it would burn through the buy orders and plummet the exchange rate.

Eventually, these loans will close, no matter what. The only question is, will the sellers leave slowly, keeping the price high, or will they dump? 




 [](/twibeam)In Episode 10, Kyousuke and Ayase are at a cosplay contest, trying to win a special figure for Kirino. Ayase remarks about the sheer number of older men excited by cosplay surrounding a children's show and Kyousuke retorts that maybe it is "proof that its popularity crosses all demographic boundaries"

 Would you be interested in helping fund an unofficial convention app for RealmsCon, this and future years?

After numerous schedule changes during the event last year, I felt it would be best to have an electronic schedule of events for the con this year. This thought led me to Guidebooks.com

I have already created a basic version, but to get full functionality, including the ability to place ads for the guests to view and social networking, it will cost a total of $5,000.

With 6 months until the convention, and regular updates as new information and guests are provided, this can present and opportunity for a great amount of viewer impressions, and higher potential returns.

 I have been able to trace my family back to one John Lee near Little Kanahwa River in present day West Virginia, born 1794, died 1838. I am thinking, due to the proximity to the famous Lee family, that there is a connection, but have been unable to find a documented link.

There seems to be no records at all beyond the deed's granting to his father Richard, but there are numerous family stories if a relation to one of the Hancock Lee's

Any ideas? 









 I trust that KSP will get this cleared up, likely tomorrow (Monday), but for those of you who may have had this problem, how long did it take to fix? 














 Everyone and their mother seems to want to force their cat into a "cute pose" and share the photo with Reddit, and they **always** get upvoted.

It's weird. 




 Most grocery stores have prepaid card centers. I could go to the store, buy any online-useable gift card (Best Buy, Karma Coin, Ultimate Gamers, PlayStation, Wii, or Xbox, among others), and send the code in PM after getting the payment.

I'd be limited in how much can be done at first, but it could mean an increase in demand for BTC, since it could be used for almost anything, and I wouldn't be hoarding too much because I'd need to sell my BTC to get more cards.

Sound like a good idea? 




 My credit was shot to hell (low-500s), with two bank accounts, a credit card, and two cell phone accounts unpaid. A couple years ago, i took a shot in the dark and opened an account at Bank of America so i could cash my paychecks for free. That got me into Merrill Edge for stock trading, which is doing well but still low. Then I saw Credit Karma on the web, and found out exactly how to clear my credit scores. 

Thanks to careful planning I have a score over 600, and heading up. I got approved for two credit cards, one a secured card from Capitol One and the other (just recently) an unsecured, no-annual fee, NFL Rewards card, and a line of credit at Fingerhut (I know, they're overpriced there, but it is okay). 

With Fingerhut, I'll buy one overpriced crap item at a time, and pay it off over time, leaving a huge portion of credit unused. I will save more by not constantly buying stuff from them then I would be spending in interest.

By my birthday, I might be in the top 50% of all credit scores in the country, and it would only go up from there!

 On the bright side, there is little worry for fraudulent transactions as a seller when accepting bitcoin. Plus, as the value goes up, the coins that I have banked become more valuable.

But on the other hand, because there is a finite amount of coins to be mined and created, those who start early with bitcoin are likely to gain a rather unfair advantage monetarily. If I buy just one bitcoin, and it becomes a global currency, then i would be one of the richest men in the world. (21,000,000 BTC/7 billion people =0.003 BTC/person average)

If my assessment is wrong, i would love to know why and how.

 Dear Mr. President,

 I am writing today as a self-appointed representative of Objectivism to discuss the budget concerns hounding our country. We have spent ourselves into a hole that many of us worry will never be gotten out of, and we can all agree that steps must be taken now to prevent our great nation from going the way of others.

The first and foremost thing we must do to stem this impending disaster is to cut spending. Cut to the bone. Cut until it hurts. Anywhere that money is wasted, that liars and cheats get what they do not deserve, or that people fall into a lull of safety at the gifts of government must be removed from our budget. And cut until the cost of finding more waste, fraud, and abuse is not worth finding anymore.

Put back the work requirements for welfare. Lower the allowable weeks of being on unemployment. Stop federal contractors from overbilling for everything they manufacture. Pass budget laws that allow only directly related amendments to bills. 

At the same time, cut and limit loopholes and deductions in the tax law to prevent cheats from paying lower than they need. Do not demonise the rich as a group, as it is the rich that do so much for our nation, but go after those who utilize the law to circumvent their true fair share.

And then, only after there is nothing left to cut, after nothing else can be removed from spending, after no more waste or fraud are visibly present, do you consider raising the tax rates. The rich, and those who wish to be rich, want nothing more than to see our nation prosper, and if there was absolutely no choice but to raise rates on any level, we would gladly give.

However, when a large portion of our population gets more back from the government than they give, and with spending so high and only climbing higher, we must conclude that there are other methods to bring down our deficit to a manageable level. We, as a country, make so much that we could do anything we wanted, if we were not burdened with this crippling debt.

That brings me to my last point of advice, when we get the budget down, and we have a surplus, do not under any circumstances release it as a rebate to the people. Use it to further pay off the debt, and lower the burden for future years. Once that debt is paid off, we could lower taxes across the board with impunity. 




 The image I am using has a small amount of blur in between two blocks of color. Should I try and replicate that, or should I correct the blur into sharper lines? 




 ... and he started going on about how much good Occupy Wall Street has done for the people. If that is true, it would literally be the first time I heard this claim, even on pro-OWS reddits. The way he was talking to me, it sounded like he expected me to sympathize with him, and give him a break on his room before he went to live like an animal in a national park.

Mind you, I am not calling him a hippie because he was a socialist, Occupy member, I called him that because he stank to high heaven, hitchhiked from Maine to Texas with his girlfriend and dog (he claims it is a service dog, but I think it was just to get around "No Pets" policies), and was wearing tie-dyed clothes, and a rastafarian hat and natty dredds. I thought I went back in time to the 70s for a second.

I was glad to be rid of him.  




 ... read the FAQ before I bought 2 11,000 bead mix buckets from the store?

I thought it would be a great idea, buy a bucket or two each paycheck, and build up enough buckets for one for each color, I underestimated how painful it is to sort 22,000 beads. 




 ...Is Nightmare Moon? It can't be a coincidence that both NM and the Crystal Ponies were banished from Equestria 1000 years ago. 









 I bought a copy of Ultimate Spider-Man #160 last week, the one with the blank cover. The anime convention I was attending had Sam de la Rosa, and he offered (for a fee) to hand-draw a sketch of Venom, Carnage, and Spider-Man on the cover and sign it.

This is the first time I had the opportunity to buy a comic of this caliber, and so I dropped the money without hesitation. Only after I received the comic (the next day from Sam, who took pictures of the work for his archives) and talked with a friend in art appraisal, did I look up the rules regarding signed comics.

They won't appraise a signed comic and certify the autograph unless they **actually** witness the signing. No exceptions! So, now I'm stuck with an ungraded comic, and if I send it to grade, they'll likely mark points off for the fact that the cover is drawn on.

So, I got to thinking, what if there was competition to the CGC in regard to grading comics? 

CGC charges an absolute minimum of $18 per comic, and that is only for modern age comics that appraise for less that $200. And they require a minimum of 20-30 comics to be submitted at once.

I could get away with $10 plus 3% of appraisal for any comic, giving a hard plastic case as part of the deal. Plus, the grading would be able to be performed by someone that cares about the details like signatures, and can take providence into account. In fact, I'd want to get signed copies, as it increases the value and the price of the appraisal.

Obviously, I wouldn't want to start such a service without support, so reply if you would be interested in an Independent Appraisal of your collectibles.

TL;dr - The CGC is too expensive for smaller collectors, let's make our own service. 



















 Send over an invite! 




 ... To Jo's newest book, "The Casual Vacancy," Coming out on the 27th?

Yes, I call her Jo. And no, I'm not her publicist. 



















 That r/atheism is run by atheists, but r/capitalists seems to be filled with socialists and communists, based on the posts I've seen? Just seems weird to me. 



















 I'm so hungry, I could eat a horse! 
























 We can't stop you from using our hotels for your "escort services" (seriously, what idiot is going to pay $250 for a 15 minute chat with a woman, unless there is sex involved), but don't post advertisements using our hotel rooms in the picture.

You're putting our logo out to the world, saying "come here and there are prostitutes", and that tarnishes our reputation.

And I'm not even gonna get into the **underage** prostitutes!

Show some god damned decorum, and at the very least take your photos in such a way that I can't tell it was my hotel by looking at it.

Signed, a very angry Front Desk Manager at a local hotel, who is tired of seeing our rooms on Back Page.

P.S. If I see **you** on Back Page, I may let you check in to the hotel, then tip off the police. Fair warning. 




 It's being tracked on Lookout. Last seen near Angelo and Santa Fe.

Give it back.

Edit - good news! The person that had the phone got in contact with us, and show be returning it to the RTA lost and found today. 




 Obviously it is possible, but will they utilize it?

Doing so would allow Windows users to seamlessly move from the HoloLens to the PC with little change.

Can it be repaired to a playable level? And roughly how much would that cost? 




 ... can they do a Magical Boys anime that isn't... girly?

I started doing a writeup of costuming and theme to make a more serious version, mixing elements of Sailor Moon with the live action Super Sentai.

I wrote out the whole thing, making suggestions along the way (I hadn't posted it, because I hadn't gotten the reference pictures for it), and realized that someone *had* already made a serious Magical Boys anime, that had certain parallels to Sailor Moon without being a parody of the genre...

Yoroiden Samurai Troopers, also known as Ronin Warriors, featured an all-male troop of young men who transformed into powerful ronin. The costuming was mostly angular (straight lines are more visually masculine compared to curves), had little frills or excess (especially in the sub-armor form).

Like Sailor Moon, they fought with their faces uncovered, but (as fitting for the more stoic men) focused less on battle speeches and more on weapons and attacks.

It was funny, I watched the whole series when it came out, and nearly forgot about it when it was most appropriate...

So, the real question is... can we do a show like this again? 



















 That one site frequented my Marvelous doesn't have a lot of them. 




 Do you not use mining software to gain ReddCoin at all, instead focusing on the proof of velocity to award?

Does everybody get a piece of the block reward based on their velocity (like interest on a bank account), or is it more random than that.

And, outside of tipping on different platforms, how useful is this as a cryptocurrency? 














 Yesterday, one of our regular, problem guests checks out of her room without saying anything. No big deal, happens all the time, but housekeeping needed my help getting inside the room.

On entering, I see ash from a cigarette on the nightstand next to the bed.

She comes back today (with the frequency that she does this, I'm sure she is a prostitute) looking for a room. I tell her flatly that she was smoking in the room before and because it was a nonsmoking room she would have to pay a cleaning fee.

 I didn't smoke in the room, though. I don't smoke cigarettes.  
 My friend might have done some marijuana...

I tell her that regardless of the kind of cigarette, there is no smoking allowed in the room, and she doubles down.

 My friend was probably just rolling a blunt...

I let the comment pass the first time, but I had to speak up.

 Don't tell me you're doing marijuana in the rooms, because that's illegal. If you want to stay, you will have to stay in a smoking room, and you'll have to pay a cleaning fee for smoking in our nonsmoking room.

 How much is that?

 $50 (our reg card says we can charge up to $250)

She left, and I doubt she'll return while I am working. (But, she'll probably try and see if the night guys go easy on her.) 





























 During the play scene, after Bipierrot destroyed everything, the girls introduced themselves for the audience.

Mars mentioned her fire attacks and red heels. Jupiter mentioned her "talent" and thunder... Then Mercury loudly proclaims "I am the number one student on the practice exam."

You would think she would be smart enough not to say something like that, if they are *secret* identities. 




 Sorry about the long one.

We had a power outage last night. Nothing major, just an idiot crashing into a pole.

Of course, everyone demands special treatment in the morning because of it. Most of the people were happy to get a $10 discount and be done with it, some didn't even ask for that much...

But there is always one.

He comes in around 10:30, and asks us to comp him the entire room for his stay. I tell him, "No. I can't do that. And with your room paid through a third party, I can not adjust your rate. But, if you stay over tonight and pay with me, I'll give the room for $69.95 ($15 off the current room rent)"

Well, that isn't good enough for them, because they use some weird referral system that pays out in room discounts, so they were getting the room for like $62.

So, they go off and decide to use that system to get the room again, asking for a little extra time to complete it. I tell them that I can give until 11:30, half an hour past checkout.

About 11:20 he comes back in and says that he forgot some paperwork in the room, and he'll need to get it to pay. At 11:45 he tells me that he needs until 12:30.

At 12:15, his wife/girlfriend/drug-addicted-crack-ho comes out, saying they need until 1... at this point, I tell her flat out, "we can not keep waiting like this. You need to take care of this right away."

"Okay, I know... But your Internet wasn't working right and you just need to give us more time! Oh, and can I get some fresh towels."

I reiterate that housekeeping is waiting on her to pay for the room, and that we will not provide housekeeping in any form until it is done.

1 PM rolls around... still no payment. I call her this time, and she tells me she needs another 15 minutes... That she is putting in the information right then, and it will be showing up on the computer any minute.

No such luck.

1:10 - I call her back, and she says that it is *literally* being processed and it will only be another 6 minutes.

Now, at this point, I'm tired of the excuses. I told her flat out that we need this done *now*, and if it doesn't happen, I'll be contacting the police to evict her.

Wouldn't you know it... nothing happens.

So, I call the police (non emergency) and have them send a uni. While waiting for that, the guest comes out "trying to get the room taken care of". Even though she already told me that it was being processed. Cops drive up, and she goes back to the room.

They talk a few minutes, and she gets them to admit that if I can be convinced to accept payment, she can stay, so she comes back to the desk.

I stick to my guns, but there is one factor I can't control.

My boss decided to walk out from the back. I kept him out of this for a reason. He has a pathological fear of confrontation with guests, and if you talk to him, you'll probably get your way. And sure enough... the guest waves cash at his face, even though it's 2 PM and the police are here to remove her, and he says just let her stay.

Every god damned time. Bring in a pet? He'll break his own posted rules to let you stay. Smoke in a nonsmoking room? Don't worry about it.

He's so interested in the online reviews that he would probably let someone rent a room with money that was stolen from him.

TL;dr guest refuses to pay until police are actually there to evict her 3 hours late, boss lets her stay anyway.  














 How many of you are interested in *legitimate* shops utilizing this system?

I sell toys, games, and other licensed merchandise. Would it be helpful or harmful for me to run on Open Bazaar?  














 We had an official celebrity stay with us.

Simon Wright from AC/DC was playing at a local sports bar with his current band, Hellion.

I didn't feel right posting anything while he was in house.

Really cool guy. We joked a round just a little, didn't have a problem showing his ID or anything.

Unfortunately, I didn't get off work in time to see the show. 









 Mostly children were buying, as is expected. He sold a handful of Mystery Minis, a bunch of Yu-gi-oh 10-4s and a pair of plush dolls.

Luna is officially sold out now.

The three girls who came in the finals on the costume contest were quite excited by the Mystery Mini they each received and showed them off to me afterward. (They got Pinkie Pie, DOMO Riddler, and Batgirl).

I plan on going to the next one, which will be in March.

If you are in the area, stop by and see the Maidens (and me, come see me.) 









 Website is still screwing the pooch, but I am able to invoice using a new software.

Send an email with your order and your information to admin@betonwhite.com

This system will also be used for any partial - paid preorders and layaways, which are not able to be made on the site. 
























 A passing mention by a car service (that happens to run prostitutes), listed Bitcoin as a payment method. Not explained or questioned, just a passing mention, as if it were a foreign currency. 




 Getting to Level 70 should be a cinch now. Only ~~1.5%~~ 1.7% of all PS4 players have reached that feat.

I just wanted to tell someone, since everyone is asleep. Carry on. 









 But, it it normal to have maintenance fees that are equal to 70% of your BTC mining?

Second major question, if I get referrals, I get 3% of their GHS, but are the fees assessed the same way? 




 It will be a corruption of Arnim Zola.

Zola feared death more than anything else, and so he put himself into the computer banks at New Jersey (insert joke about NJ being worse than death here). We can assume that he would have had a backup within SHIELD's databases.

When Natalya released the HYDRA/SHIELD files onto the internet, that purge included the backed up Arnim Zola.

Enter the enterprising young scientist, Henry Pym, who uses the Zola "program" as a basis for ULTRON, who in turn becomes the very thing Red Skull wanted in the first place.

Cut off one head, two more shall take its place. 









 We were talking about money (he is an Indian student working here while in college) and the conversation naturally ended up on bitcoin.

When I told him about the less than $1 transaction fee worldwide, he was convinced. 

He's getting a coinbase and cex.io account set up, and once he does, I'll send over a GHS for him to start earning.   




 Why is it, when we live in a post-9/11 society, where people are worried about security, where you can't get on a plane of your credit card doesn't match your ID, would you get your credit card to have a nickname on it?

The one I saw wasn't even an imaginative nickname. It was "Sal Salinas".

Basically anyone with the last name Salinas could walk up, and use this guy's card, just by saying "Yeah, I go by 'Sal'".

It would be like me getting a card that read "Kinyutaka", then wondering why I get challenged on it. 



















 Local customer comes in, gets the room for the night, causes no real problem until the morning.

11 o'clock rolls around, and they haven't left yet. Housekeeping asks them if they are staying, and to call me at the front desk to take care of it.

They don't. I call them, and they feed me the usual lie "we overslept and we'll come down to pay right away".

They don't. They never come down. We call again, and go up to find that they simply took their time to leave and didn't bother saying anything after they told me they were going to stay.

What's worse is the pile of dog shit sitting in the corner of the room for us to clean up.

We are not a pet friendly hotel. It is on the signs, it is on the registration, and we tell it to the guest's face when they are signing.

I wish I could plaster these people's names all over the place, so everyone knows what kind of people they are... 




 Idea comes from a post on /r/ravenclaw (on mobile, so I can not link) 









 ... and she felt there was something a bit off. She couldn't even explain to me what she didn't like about the episode.

[Lamebrained theory](#s "My thought was that feeling of unease was intentional by the directors, mimicking the Doctor's faulty regeneration and memory issues. Case in point, the scene at the end, where the robot may have jumped or the Doctor may have thrown him. Even *he* doesn't know what actually happened.")

I think the visual direction of the show is meant to mimic the personalities of the Doctor.

What do you think? 









 I have the whole script, and just need to get the images and sound files to complete the program.

Too bad I'll probably never be able to make a real release, as it would be quashed by Hasbro. 









 Only 2000 will be made. I have ordered a few for my store.

Snap them up quick.  



















 But is it just because of the Square-Enix sale? 
























 I would like to use small videos for my store to give a simple demonstration of the cards in use, but I do not want a boring demo with two people playing the game.

If anyone can make a short, less than 1 minute scene with Jace directing his Tidal Warrior (or other blue creature less than 3/3) to attack Chandra, who blocks it with a Cinder Wall, and you would be willing to work on other short videos for the same purpose, please contact me.

Videos will be uploaded onto a YouTube channel and linked to my website at www.betonwhite.com, with links to your personal website or YouTube channel.

Edit: I forgot to spell out that I do intend to pay for the work performed, but would like to speak with the artist that volunteers for this chance before negotiating a price. 









 We have a swim meet this weekend here in town, and of course that means that a number of teams are staying at the hotel. 

They *all* want to leave their stuff in the rooms, go to the meet in the morning, come back around 2, shower and get their stuff, and leave around 3 PM.

Naturally, with our checkout time at 11AM, I had to deny their requests.

At least one team just decided they were going to take it anyway. I might have to just charge them for tonight, a couple more want to complain to my boss, which won't do much good, though they will probably lie on me and say that I was incredibly rude (the standard when someone is told "no"), which my boss will believe and I'll get in trouble. 

But if I just let half a dozen rooms leave whenever they want, I'll get in trouble for that. 









 Forgive me if I mention one that was there that I didn't notice.

 ... Then calls my boss two days later to say I threatened him in front of his family.

Naturally, my boss, who has known me for years, believes every word this guy has said and threatens to fire me.

I think it is time to find something new.  




 The grand prize? $1,000,000. Or is it?

Out of the entire promotion, 2 people (1 US, 1 Canadian) will get to draw a single number from 1-50, and if they get the right number, they win $1,000,000.

If they don't, they only get $10,000 each.

The promotional materials probably cost more than the prizes they are going to give out.

At least a car dealership gives a booby prize to everyone that enters.  














 I'm up to date on getting all previous Milestones issued (my time has been hard on me still), and I have noticed that we have now exactly 59 orders, meaning the next completed order (canceled ones don't count, even if the computer does) will be the recipient of the 6th Customer Milestone, $1 for any order under $50,  or 2% of the total if above. 




 He says he's the "ex-King of Cypress", black, young, blonde mohawk. He's rambling on and on about how he came down here from Houston to rescue a girl.

While here, he has had multiple tickets, his license suspended, and his car impounded.

All this sounds like a sob story by a homeless guy to stay in the lobby, right?

Another guest comes in while he's there, asks about rates, etc, and when she leaves, he pops up with a rifle scope in his hands, saying "she wouldn't even know what hit her" and starts talking about his skills at killing people.

I'm wondering if I should put a tip into Mental Health once we have him in a room. 




 It's by no means a complete set, and I think I got rid of most of the Energy cards, but does anyone still have, play or want these?

I'll try to post pictures later on, if anyone wants.

For the Rental Service, I am assuming that any game offering Free rental for multiple time options simply hasn't decided on a price yet.

Games not available on PSN are not listed, as there is no comparison. 




 What exactly is the "Channel" games section?

Is that going to house games that we've purchased previously? Or are otherwise available with a monthly rental option?

I'll be honest, I'm not exactly stoked to have to pay $15 to play Final Fantasy XIII again, when I own it for the PS3. I hope they would link PS Now to the SEN servers and let us play any digital downloads for free, as well as let us use the PS Now service to play games we have the disc for. 




 Lady came in with an Expedia reservation. I ask for her ID and credit card and she gives me the usual "They've already charged it." speech.

I remind her that we just need a valid card in case of incidental charges, and she asks if I'm going to run her card. Now, I don't normally run the cards, but 9 times out of 10 when they ask me that, they are giving me a bad one. So, I reiterate that the card just needs to be valid (basically, she just has to tell me it is, because we don't have a way of checking without charging).

So, she gets angry with me, and we finish the check-in, finally. I point out her room on the map, point out where she can park, direct her to the stairwell, and she leaves kind of hurried.

My manager, who was in the lobby to supervise the painters, asks me to go up to check on a room that had a problem reported, and as I am coming down the stairs, I end up meeting the family I just checked in.

 Where's the room, Mom?

 I don't know, that asshole didn't tell me.

She sees me up the stairs, looking at her.

 Yeah, I called you an asshole!

I say nothing and finish walking down the stairs, and I see them starting to pass the stairs to go into the first floor hallway. I step back closer to the wall and point up the stairs,

 Your room is up this way, ma'am.

 It's upstairs? Don't you have an elevator?

 No, I'm sorry.

She rushes past me, moving up the stairs with her 7 and 12 year old children.

 Stupid asshole...

 Ma'am, if you are not happy here, you can stay somewhere else...

I turned my back to her.

 And that's great parenting, by the way. 




 and tttles. let's ban tttles, too.  









 My site is www.betonwhite.com

Ask me about the different card games, toys, or memorabilia, or just ask if I can get something else.

Or just ask about my day job, that's cool, too. 












































 The mattresses, the nightstand, the microwave, the couch. They left the TVs only because they were bolted down.

I called the police and they tried to force me into a telephone report, instead of sending an officer as I requested.

Edit with updates - We found which guest had done this, they were checked into the room right next to the original crime scene.

After coaxing the police to come in, they said that they wouldn't be able to process the room for fingerprints or other evidence. They gave their case numbers and went to the car to file the report. 

Housekeeping calls me almost immediately to let me know that the neighboring room was having trouble with the lock, and that they had seen guests climbing in and out through the window. I open the door and find the room in worse shape than the first.

The light fixtures had been torn from the bathroom, the bed was simply gone, the television was on the ground and the dresser it had been bolted to was missing, the couch and recliners were gone, the second bed was wrecked, and naturally they took the mini fridge and microwave.

So I got the attention of the cop again, and now we have a crime scene tech going over the rooms. 




 This is a warning for customers and businesses. I apologize if this isn't the best location for this.

Apparently, scam artists have found a way to tap into 800 numbers while they are queuing for an operator. When the call is redirected, a foreign operator will apologize for the long hold time and offer a gift card or other compensation, and ask for a credit card for processing fees.

Obviously, you should never give out credit card information for unsolicited items, nor should you ever give credit card information in order to get money from a company.

If you fall prey to this scam, make sure you advise the company that there may be unknown recurring charges, and treat your credit/debit card as stolen. 









 And what is your stance on buying cards from out of state?  




 I work at a sunny motel, all but managing the breakfast area in addition to front desk, and recently Corporate made the unilateral decision to change all of the breakfast items to be "healthy".

They took out a lot of the sweet items, like danishes, and replaced them with better choices, like cinnamon raisin bread.

The problem was, our location had previously had the best breakfast we could manage for our class of hotel.

The changes meant that instead of hand-cooked scrambled eggs and sausage, we had to make precooked omelets with 'cheese'. Our breads were almost all replaced by the cinnamon bread. We had to stop giving out oatmeal in the instant packets, and had to cook oatmeal in a kettle daily.

Needless to say, our guests are not happy. The omelets taste horrible and take forever to heat up. The oatmeal takes an hour to be ready to eat. We have a much lower variety of food, thanks to getting rid of most of our breads.

I was planning on calling to the GM hotline to give them a piece of my mind...

When the breakfast director called me, asking how the new breakfast was working out. And I told her the truth. It stinks.

We at the hotel hate it, because of the time it takes to prepare. The guests hate it because they were used to a wider variety from us.

I told her that we need a waiver to allow us to go back to the sausage and eggs and to put out the instant oatmeal again.

I also told her that we need to be given discretion on extra items, not on the list.

Even though I was polite and conversational, she still meekly stated that she will talk to someone higher up to make the changes I suggested.  

I think we're going to have our good breakfast back. 









 I already have the My Little Pony CCG on my website, and now I can start selling toys figures and other collectibles from the show, and other related properties on the site.

I'll start adding items one at a time, first update will be tonight.

I'll let you decide on what to add first.

The ever popular Blind Bag figures, Travel Mugs, or the Derpy Tin-Tastic pencil set. 

Leave comments below, I take all sorts of suggestions. 

Edit: Feel free to still give suggestions, but I am choosing to start with the Blind Bag figures. I have an order of 48 on the way, and you can start buying yours now.

 Because, I'm at 233% light speed right now. 


































 And I'm not even mad about it. 









 I don't know if this will happen, but this would be the best end that I can think of. The show has been signed for another three years, and this will assume it ends at that timeframe.

Over the course of the show, Penny has shown herself to be more and more interested in nerd culture and science thanks to Leonard and the gang. During the next two seasons, this interest can blossom into a full passion, leading to the second year finale, where she asks Leonard and Sheldon to help her start a show to make science more interesting to normal children, like Bill Nye or Professor Proton.

The third, and final, season of the show has her working with everyone to make the show-within-a-show, with her as the host and relating scientific concepts in a friendly manner, scripted by Bernadette and Raj.

The penultimate episode ends with Penny getting a call from Dr. Gablehauser, offering her an honorary doctorate for her work. In the last episode, Howard acts all steamed for a bit before getting over the fact that Penny gets to be called Doctor before he does. This also serves as a way of finally revealing her last name, which was carefully guarded over the series run. 
























 I am operating an online card shop and had a package of cards sent to me by my supplier at the hotel I work (the shop is relatively new).

Fedex lost my package, saying they dropped it off at someone's house, but they don't know where.

I anyone got a package for "Bet on White" during the day Wednesday, please contact me here so I can pick it up. 




 Much shorter than my last rants.

Indian student comes into the lobby, asks if we are hiring and who the manager is. I offered my Indian boss's pseudonym "Bill" and proceed to hand him an application, like I do for any other person looking for a job.

 Do I have to fill out the application? I want a job under the table.

I look to him with a straight face, then to the line of customers behind him, and tell him that he does, and that it is illegal to be paid under the table for work. (I don't normally go that far, but I didn't want the guests to have the impression that we hire like that, even though my stupid boss does)

He persists for a minute, and ultimately leaves without filling out the application at all.

Guest walks up to the counter with a laugh, and I tell him the funniest part. If Bill wanted to hire him under the table after he filled out an application,  he could simply throw it away afterwards.  














 It's Spring Break here, in a coastal town, to give you the background on this reservation.

Semi - regular guest comes in at 8, 9 in the morning and asks for a room right away. I explain to him that the room is not ready yet, as we had a full house, but I get him reserved for the night so he doesn't have to worry. 

He calls over and over again throughout the morning, asking for the room to be ready, parking in the back and bugging the different housekeepers, and generally being impatient. I tell him specifically not to bother housekeeping while he is waiting for his room.

2 o'clock rolls around, and he comes up to the desk again. I tell him that they haven't let me know yet, and that if I didn't know by the time my relief arrived at 3, I would find out for him.

He says okay, and walks off toward the back, then goes to one of the housekeepers and convinces him to let them into a room (that wasn't even the room assigned to him), saying that I told him it was okay.

I wouldn't even have known about it if the housekeeper hadn't thought to tell me after. I told them to leave. Period. We are busy enough that we will rerent the room, no problem. 

Turns out the housekeepers know that he was dealing drugs from the room during previous stays.  




 Simple story, constantly repeated in any hotel setting.

Guest makes their reservation through ThatOneInternetSiteWeKnow.com (fake name if that is actually a domain out there) and gets the room to arrive on Friday. She calls me afterwards to make sure everything is good.

Friday comes around and she calls back, saying that she will be coming later than expected. Again, no big deal. I note that she will arrive late.

By the night audit, she still hadn't shown up, but I left the note, so the NA checked the room in.

Guest arrives at 3PM, Saturday, and asks for her reservation. The poor Indian student (I was off) at the desk is temporarily confused by the missing reservation, as it was no longer reserved. It was In House.

Guest calls TOISWK, who calls the desk and assists him in finding the room. Problem solved, right? 

Wrong. 

She comes in this morning,  Monday, to make sure she was credited for the stay Friday night, saying that the person who had trouble finding her room told her she'd be refunded.

So, I told her calmly, carefully, that we can not credit her back for any reason on a third-party booking, as we did not charge her. I also explained to her that despite any difficulty in finding the reservation, it was in the computer the whole night and that the room was not rerented in any way. But i told her that if she wishes to dispute the charges, she must do so with TOISWK. 

She calls them, who calls me asking to refund, and I reiterate that we will not refund. The room was in house on Friday and was held for her to check in at any time. We also would have had to turn guests away, as it is Spring Break (not that you can tell from the weather).

Guest comes back to the lobby, TOISWK on the phone in her ear, and demands that I grant permission.

Now, at this point, I am stonewalling. I apologized for any mistakes or misinformation that may have been given, but I would not give in and remove the night's charge. I also refused to call the manager out from the more important things he was doing, as I know he doesn't like dealing with people. 

After the guest leaves in a huff to call corporate to try and get a refund, I bring the information to the manager so he knows what is going on.

Lo and behold, he was *there* when the FD looked for the reservation and he most definitely did not offer any sort of credit or refund. He told me that if she came back, he would talk to her, but she simply left the building. 

TL;dr Entitled self - important guest thinks she can dictate our refund policies. 









 My supplier is currently out of stock on Magica Madoka. As such, we are currently suspending backorders for single cards until reprint.

For those who have backordered cards (primarily Sayaka Miki) I will get in contact with you in short time to either amend or refund your orders. 

I am sorry for any inconvenience in this matter, but rest assured that I will continue to provide the best service possible.  









 Hey, every pony, I've started a website devoted to selling single trading cards and collectible card games, and wanted you to know that shortly we will be adding some of the MLP card sleeves for sale. We'll be getting Trixie and DJ Pon3 to start.

I am also looking into a distributor for the Enterplay trading card series and the MLP CCG. I'll send more word when they are available.

Edit - I am getting a hoof full of 1 and 2 player starter boxes from my distributors. I'll set up pre orders for them shortly, so I can start shipping out as soon as they arrive. 

  Check out my [Facebook page](https://facebook.com/profile.php?id=1468747983347018) for up to date information.

I am currently focusing on Wei Schwarz, a card game growing in popularity here in the states and very big in Japan, and will be branching into Magic: the Gathering, Pokemon, Yu-gi-oh, and others in time.

Bitcoin payments are performed manually. You put in the order and email, and I will contact you with payment address and amount. 
























 Don't stop. 




 Project Diva available singles include images up to E040 (Hatsune Miku "Pansy"), an additional 60 singles in the system without images.

In-stock, but not in the system are Sword Art Online and Fate/Zero singles, with Madoka arriving Monday.

I should be completed entering them in by the end of the month, but if there are any requests for cards *not* in the system, leave a message here and I will put it High Priority for addition. 














 From the Heart of the Cards Merchant Acceptance Letter,

 Marketing Requirements

 WeiB Schwarz is to be written with either a capital B or the german
character equivalent. Note that "Weiss", while a popular transliteration,
is incorrect, and should not have top billing. ("WeiB Schwarz / Weiss
Schwarz" is okay, simply "Weiss Schwarz" is not). This is a high-priority request from Bushiroad themselves. 




 Lady comes into the office, kids in tow, her husband starts making a baby bottle on my counter, and she interrupts my interaction with the person in front of her.

I make her wait the half a minute it takes to tell my guest where to go, and get her information and she decides to take a room. So far, so good, though she told me that she was going to be the only adult, when I see her husband right there. The kids aren't old enough, so it doesn't change the rate anyway.

She pulls out an absolutely mangled ID. It's been cut into pieces and taped back together, with the ID number, name, and photo on three different pieces. Huge red flags in my head already, with her trying to rush me and then the questionable ID. And then I see my out.

The piece that has the ID number also has an expiration date of two weeks ago. I told her I couldn't rent to her with an invalid ID.

Edit: Part 2!

She comes back in, her children in tow, and brings along someone else with a valid ID. We start getting her signed in and I ask for payment, and get the response, "Oh! She didn't pay you yet?"

Nope. She didn't. I give them the price and they make a huge deal getting out the money, hand me the money, then change their mind about staying.

I didn't even have to be an asshole that time,  and they left. 

My guess is that they were hoping I'd have forgotten about the fact that I didn't charge them for not taking the room.
