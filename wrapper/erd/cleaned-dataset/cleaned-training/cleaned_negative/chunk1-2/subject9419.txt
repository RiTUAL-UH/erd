 I took it and it is virtually the same. 95% Sanders and 91% Hillary Clinton. Given that AND (not because) the fact that I like Hillary more I feel more than comfortable to keep supporting Hillary. No offense to Sanders but he just doesn't inspire me in the same way as Hillary has the last few years. 




 He's attractive but I'm not sure I'd watch baseball just for that. I've only recently realized that sports aren't actually horrible or terribly boring in the last year or so and started watching some of them but baseball is one that I just stopped even trying to get into. 
























 Tyler Posey is too hot not to be. And all the other eye candy is a nice bonus. The show could definitely do with more lacrosse, though. I've watched a few MLL matches and it is quite good. 




 I was just reading that actually. While I do like what he is saying it seems to be essentially the same rhetoric I've heard from most of the other candidates on the Democratic side, so this isn't inspiring--it is stuff they're all parroting in some form or another (and I agree with it). Definitely not enough to have me choose Sanders over any other candidate, like Hillary. As I stated above, apparently I match up virtually the same with both Sanders in Hillary on the issues so it is unlikely that their stances on the issues by themselves will be enough to sway me from one or the other.
