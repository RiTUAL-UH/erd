 Thanks for your response Lars0. I just read today about The Planetary Society utilizing a cubesat for their solar sail deployment. Before I was unaware such a thing existed. 




 What most adequately prepared you for your career in aerospace? If not adequately prepared, what would you have done differently to prepare for entering the field? I am a student working towards an undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering and would appreciate any advice you may have for someone with a desire to work in aerospace engineering. My request is not, however, intended to specifically target engineers. I am generally curious how you prepared for any position in the industry. Listing your current or past positions would be a great help as well. 
























 This was excellent information. Thanks for your replies. If an experimentalist happens to read this please tell us of your experiences. 




 I'm interested in research as well. Though I can't say I would know what to expect. Should I be able to fit some time in for research one semester I will certainly do it. What was research like for you as an undergraduate?
