 At that height and speed, he might as well have belly flopped on concrete. 




 They can have a 1 trillion pixel camera for all I care, the nexus 5 has an awesome camera from a hardware perspective.. Instead of making the phones bigger and the screens clearer, Google needs to fix their camera software!!

My old Sony Ericsson K810 takes better photos than every Nexus I've owned.

 Unfortunately Australia isn't the friendliest of countries when it comes to running a business. Taxes, and overheads are out if control, so completely understand.
 




 She was executed with a shot to the heart.. 




 Also this.. http://youtu.be/y6120QOlsfU 




 I was about 8 or 9, and it was horrible. 

I remember everyone telling me "you're still young, you'll like it when you get older".

Nope. I still don't like beer, but spirits on the other hand..

Nothing like a good 18 year old Glenfiddich on the rocks.  




 Congrats guys, the more of shops the better it is for us consumers.

A little feedback though, your juice prices are a touch expensive for flavours we can readily get from other suppliers that have B M's... 




 Does not wanting to watch ever again count? If so, Anything with Pauly Shore, especially bio-dome. 




 The 1.5mm drill bit for my dual coils and 2mm for my single coil build. 

That's all you need :) 




 That staff is such a great looking dog, thanks for the links, as pups they look really similar, I guess once it fills out you'll see the differences  




 If you went and fucked yourself that would be perfect.  




 It doesn't look too pitbull, a common problem we have here in Australia is that people register american pitbulls as Staffy's, then when they attack it gives the staff a bad name..

Either way, its a good looking pup! 




 Is that an American Staffy? 




 Which Reddit app are you using? 




 Is that like Gargamel from the smurfs? 




 Have you got pictures of the engine layout and how they look? Having 2 engines with that much power is awesome.

Being methanol, they should be running icy cold 




 This has probably been the most insightful post on Reddit so far.

I had no idea he was involved in so many shows and was so talented.

I'm definitely giving your recommendations a go, I need something new to watch! 




 Its a shame that the show was cancelled. 

I used to watch it here and there as a kid, but never really appreciated it. 

I recently 'backed up' all of the season and watched it from season 1-13, and it is brilliant. 

The show didn't dumb down like the Simpsons did, and managed to stay true to their story line.

Dale Gribble.. I wish there were more episodes devoted to him. 




 I'm 50/50 on that one, its ok, but not my cup of tea! 

At least the royalties from King of the Hill would've tied them over for a while! 




 Is it true that they based the look of Dale a lot on the voice actor that played him? 




 That's an awesome pickup! I thought it was the earlier seasons that had it and they dropped it later on 




 I never realised it was an actual track, thanks for the link 




 Mate, they've been there for a while.. Hopefully they don't remove them 




 The provari is a huge upgrade, the Nautilus is a downgrade. 

The protank has a much better vape and it's cheaper! 




  http://youtu.be/8TJ_LlGilLo 




 Yup' some champion uploaded full episodes to YouTube. Makes my days at work fly by, I tell you h'wat 




 Dale, do you think using a backhoe to open a beer can is a good idea!? 




 I have a feeling Katrina will start playing a bigger part after this 




 I know, sorry mate.

I surf Reddit via mobile 99.9% of the time and don't know how to do it from a phone 




 Streaking around the quad : http://youtu.be/BhIpPeOmCR8 




 12:39 - has me laughing every time.

It has to be my most favourite moment. 









 Here's something for you!

 http://youtu.be/5Ja64ZWv3Ck 




 Not anymore though, he's walked into Jessica's office to fess up? 




 He wore sneakers.. For sneaking! 




 They needed more Dale Gribble centric episodes. He was hilarious.

Shi Sha!! 




 I'm watching Season 3 and it was the Angel episode.. Shit episode.

Never a fan of Buckley, glad they dropped that character. 




 Depends on your country.. Lion Heart was released as Wrong Bet as well. 




 You want me to break my leg?? 




 Kickboxer is also one of those gifs.. 2 best movies of all time.

Kickboxer and Bloodsport. 




 For some reason I find the period panties less disturbing than panties with the weird goop you guys discharge randomly all month long. 




 Mate god knows what they were thinking with the UC Torana, it was an after thought of a car to bring in the VB commodore. 

My first car was a 5.0L VL Calais.. 

Memories. 




 All credit to the XA and XB for ride and comfort, I don't mind the front end, it's more the rounded back that I wasn't too big of a fan of.

My most hated car of that Era when it comes to Holden and Ford would still be the UC Torana.. and I'm a Holden boy.

You're lucky to be still holding onto one, they're hard to find these days, or priced so high they are out of reach! 




 Someone messed up and spelt Cassandra wrong. 




 Scrappy fucken Doo

'Let me at him, let me at him' fuck off already! 




 Rolf Harris!? Maybe he was upset you didn't put out for him? 

You were 13 right? 




 Never liked the XA or XB shape, but for its age it is brilliant.

XY shape was a lot nicer for me, but not as nice as an old A9X SS :) 




 Yeah, nah.. I'm not claiming I'm a foreigner if I am proven wrong.

I'm not in the US, I am in Aus, this nobody, is just that.. a nobody here.

Maybe the title should be 'US only famous rapper', or 'famous rapper to 16 year olds'.. 

Famous rappers would be, Dre, Ice Cube, Eminem, Eazy-E, Snoop insert animal, 2Pac, etc..   




 Nope.. Well not to me anyways buddy.

It had me scratching my head on what you were rambling on about, so at least you win that prize! 




 Haha I get it now!!! You hijacked someone else's post and now its yours!

Well done buddy, hope she works out well for you and you get to claim the points when they come along.

At least it wasn't a gonrwild post, you might've had some explaining to do  




 So you're not Lisaslover? Dude, you have me scratching my head on what's going on. 

Its making me laugh trying to figure out your little saga. 




 Are you arguing with yourself? Im confused on what's going on here  




 Sometimes it makes you wonder if the $200 price tag for the Nemesis is actually justified.. I have a clone that set me back $20 or so from fasttech.. 3 months and kicking strong. 









 I honestly dont get it. 

I have a son and am no longer with my wife, when I see my son and am with him, everything else in the world is non existent, its just him.

When I'm not with him all I think about is him and hoping he's smiling and playing. 

There is no chance on this earth that I would ever chose anyone over him or his love. 

All I hope and wish for is that one day he says 'I want to live with dad'.. My life would be complete.
 




 Mr Vain only came out like 10 years ago ... Damn. 




 I sighed when I read this.. The sigh of understanding.

Same boat as you.. It sucks either way.. With them and the life without them.

Sigh. 




 Did you? 




 I rather this than hearing about dogs being pitted against each other  




 I'm guessing you have quite an old / early built house.. 




 Coming from a person that doesn't even like cats, I even knew which gif it was going to be. 

After a while Reddit becomes a giant repost. 




 I'm guessing you're referring more to when you have a bloody nose? 

If so, I believe this has to do with the majority of taste being attributed to smell, and with the blood already in your nasal passages this would increase the strength of the taste vastly. 




 www.nicvape.com

This will last you ages

http://www.nicvape.com/store/p/45-125-ml-of-100-mg-ml.aspx

Let me know how big your juice bottle is and the mg you're after, I can help you out with the mix you need 




 Its a bit shitty looking, but its not really a bad tattoo.. 




 Is that another satirical sub? I'm just not sure anymore.. 




 Not sure if you're being sarcastic or honest.. 

If this was Australia and they decked out in all Australian flag gear, the only the thing they won't be getting is laid.

I admire the American patriotism. 




 Thank you. All I saw was a blurry photo of nuts and chips. 




 In the later seasons I would definitely agree, once she straightened her hair etc, she looked awesome, but early on in the series, not really my cup of tea 




 I'm going out on a limb here, the Elaine in this case seems a little prettier to me 




 I work for a large company, one that FORCED everyone to only use Blackberry.. Now with the move to Outlook for an email client they doors are open to any phone.

Samsung and Apple.. There is not one blackberry in sight. 




 Fuck you OP, I've watched this about a thousand times and almost know it word for word!

This has to become the new SMS tone. 




 On my android - Reddit is Fun 




 Thanks OP, finally a post in /r/WTF actually made me say.. WTF! 




 Spearmint goes awesome with my coffee.. Its kind of like having a mint slice biscuit..  




 Watermelon, Rock Melon, Honeydew Melon, all these melons are awesome.

Mango is another that I could easily devour half the tree. 




 Yeah, I can see your point, and you get to see his highlights..  




 Really? Why? 

I'm honestly intrigued on why international folk like this guy so much? 




 You're not alone mate, I'm sure 90% of us have. 




 Your cotton might be too thick , also as above the ohms might be too low, I have mine at 1.2 and its awesome. 




 Why would they do that!, of course it would.. 

I guess this is why you pay what you do for a clone.. 




 You're right. No one ever WANTS to watch season one, you have to. 

As much as I love Seinfeld, I only watch seasons 3 and above 




 Damn!! Everything about the panzer I'll hate except for the  button.

Thanks for the feedback 




 Thanks mate, what do you mean by painted threads?? 




 Bingo dude, get the aerotank. When you're back on home soil you can start start the coil process. 




 Mate you've gone that far, the Nautilus will let you down on what is an awesome setup.

Bite the bullet and get the Kayfun lite clone they have and get coiling.

You will then have my exact setup and you'll never look back.

I'll come off as the most negative person for stating this about 30 times in this subreddit, the Nautilus is RUBBISH. 




 What's the Panzer like? I have a nemesis but thinking of trying the panzer out.  (Clone) 




 When I was using the protank or just a standard evod, I always vaped a doubler as the flavour was quite muted.

When I went kayfun and cotton, the doubler was VERY overpowering.

Now I vape a errr one.fivebler.. I leave 3/4's of the doubler and VG the rest.. I like getting a good flavour smack.

This also depends on the flavour. 




 Yep.. Hop onboard buddy..

Unfortunately, 3/4's of the AMA's are the same deal..

"I was that extra, in the background on a show that no one watched.. AMA!" 




 You didn't read what I wrote, you pretty much just jumped the gun.

I have no issue with you replacing smoking with vaping IF you actually smoked.

My dilemma is having teens that have never smoked actual cigarettes picking up vaping, just to have them blow clouds in a bus or a train thinking everyone is looking at them in a positive way "they all think I'm cool".

I was a teen once, and this would've been my mentality, same mentality I had that got me smoking.. 

 




 To be honest, we only know about who is what in the US via commercial radio in Aus, this guys hasn't made it here yet.

Sorry about Guy Sebastian though, you can keep him.. 




 He is one of the best, he's hilarious to listen to as well.

 




 Thats not the issue, I started smoking at 14, and would've loved for someone to switch me off them.

It's teens that NEVER smoked, but pick them up solely to cloud chase.  




 Dude, we know what you're trying to say, but your logic is flawed.

We aren't taking stabs at you, and me calling you ignorant is probably a fair comment, look up what the true definition of ignorant means. 




 he might be more of a US thing...  




 you are ignorant and making yourself look even dumber with every post. 




 I got my hands on a fresh batch of Banana Custard from Steam e-cigs on Saturday, and boy am I glad I did.

It is the usual 50/50 mix that they dish up, although I purchase doublers and mix the rest with only VG.

Even with the VG content being so high, the flavour is rich and full, definitely a single shot type juice and no need for a stronger flavour mix.

Taste - This is one of those rare juices that you can 100% put your finger on and call it as soon as you taste it, it tastes exactly like Banana Yogo!.

It doesn't have that chemical candy Banana taste, it literally tastes like Banana Yogo / Custard.

I have been vaping crazy on this juice and definitely will be keeping it as a part of my all day vape collection.

They have modified their 'Sins of Vanilla' from a pure vanilla juice, to more of a pastry vanilla, but not quite sold on this yet.. the team have advised that there is a custard in the works, so I'll hold tight till then.

 




 Guys what am I doing wrong?

My 18490 in my Zmax is making plumes of fog from the Kayfun, where the Nemesis seems weak and no where near as powerful..

I'm on a 1.8ohm coil and running on 9w on the Zmax

What's going on here!?

Edit: thanks to all that helped! I made a 1ohm coil (single), it now hits like a truck and the flavour is on another level!!

On a negative note, I've now threaded the screw on the kayfun block.. FFS.. I can't win. 









 Hoping I can get an opinion or review from an owner in here.

What's the size like?
Durability?

Etc.. 




 I'm sure there's a few owners on here..

+How did you start?

+How does supply work from manufacturers? (As in do you pay upfront etc)

+what's business like?

I'm happy for a PM if you don't want to publicly post..

I'm interested in opening up a store down under as its a market I can see exploding soon, and there is hardly any stores here at all. 





























 He cringes even more when he vapes it and I tell him that he's got my PENIS Juice in his mouth. 




 I can't remember his name on here, but if you see this, thank you for the naming idea! 









 Yep, if that's the risk you have to take, so be it.

The US does it all the time, they apologise for it, and the world forgets.

We live in a shit world, and that's the reality of it. 




 Thank you.. As someone who never has and never will bookface, you're a champ. 




 Thankfully the sound also failed on the video. 




 Peggy!, the boy. 




 I just googled up Zoe Quinn.. 

It would need to be a cold day in hell and about 40 bottles of JD before I would even consider seeing her naked. 




 So you're running a single coil and not dual?

I'm waiting for my first dripper to arrive and not sure if I should hit a dual coil or single coil setup.

I did a dual .8 coil setup in my Kayfun and it was horrible, but I'm guessing it will be different in a dripper.

I was planning a single 1.1 coil as I prefer the cooler Vape 




 I sold mine by word of mouth to a fellow vaper that was on an evod..

The SVD is a great unit, but it's too big and ugly  




 What's your setup mate?

Mod, tank, coils etc 




 You're being down voted for expressing your own personal opinion.. 

Post a cat video, that's what this place (Reddit) thrives off.

I'm with you, fuck ISIS and nuke the shit out of all of them.

 




 Fat Bastard from Austin Powers - 'I'm sad cause I eat, and I eat cause I'm sad, its a vicious cycle' 




 That cop at the end had the same attitude, he was walking up like a curious bystander with his hands behind his back..  




 Yeah Nah, the professor Finks on here ruined that for me. 




 Thankfully I'm using Reddit on the mobile, each link comes up with the address instead of launching. 

Its 11pm here and really didn't feel like making any of them purple if they were live leak vids :) 




 All was awesome in your post, until the last line. 




 Hmm.. Poor bastard suffered the whole way through, there goes my theory and hoping he had some sort of luck in the situation. 




 Sex, wife and condom.. One of the three don't fit in the equation. 




 It would be terrifying but probably not painful?, I need someone sciencey to back me up, but he would've knocked himself out with the lack of oxygen that he used up and the carbon dioxide that he was exhaling..

I reckon drowning would have to be the most terrifying way to die. 




 Not specifically for heating in the use you are after.

Where are you based? As you can buy the stuff for a dollar a meter at most vape places 

 




 Hats, t-shirts and kids parents telling stories about their kids saying Yolo and when they did it. I blame you America. 




 Haha, my background is eastern European, I can relate. 




 Australia is late to catch on to American fads.. Its here and its painful. 




 In your awesomeness, can you please kill off yolo as well? 




 Your post reminds me of that old meme where there is a smoking hot girl in the pic, sub titled 'she's someone else's headache' - so very true. 

 




 I gave you an upvote, a sympathy one.. 




 Yup.. Only thing I change is the cotton when I'm switching flavours or if its starting to taste a little burnt. 

A couple hits of the coil dry burns all the crap off it ready for a re-wicking. 




 What's their stance on abortion? 




 I read all of these articles and it still doesn't change the facts of our society and world we live in.

Breathing in vapour will always be safer than inhaling burning matter and smoke, but the amount of money governments will lose on tobacco tax won't help us get vaping mainstream.

All smokers have basically covered themselves and 2 others for medical bills when it comes to the amount of tax being paid per packet smoked.

The only way I see vaping getting anywhere is when it is taxed severely and vape companies start donating ludicrous amounts of money to government parties.

The tobacco industry has been a controlling asshole for many years, and will continue to be.

tl;dr - government will lose too much money if vaping takes over, tobacco industries will always stranglehold us. 




 Why don't you just remove the legs? 




 Mine is on its way as we speak :) 




 I did, I never said I realised it was only for AMA's did I? 

Now fuck off back to your hole you crawled out of. 




 Installed  opened  love the design, hate that its only AMA  uninstalled 




 Thanks mate appreciate it  




 I remember watching the behind the scenes of that episode, the cast and crew actually didn't know what her name was going to be until the very end of the shoot.. 

One of the crowd members guessed it as Delores, and funny enough they only thought of the name a few moments before  




 I have a Nemesis clone which is now all battered and bruised.. Is the stingray clone any good? 

I have a Chi You, but its too chunky. 




 I read your comment in Samuel L Jacksons voice from Pulp Fiction.. When he was discussing his knowledge of giving a foot massage.. "I'm the foot fucking master" 




 Check the post history.. The same tone of comments are littered all across Reddit. 




 The troll seems legit..

From the post history, I can make out that she's a fat black woman that was more than likely backhanded a few times.  




 Exactly my story, same as Seinfeld as well. 




 That's the one!! 




 Where are you flying from?

I was up there over the weekend and I don't know what it is with that place, my tank kept on leaking like a bitch of a thing! Must be the humidity or warmth etc.

Drove me insane.  




 Dale, why are you removing the bug from the Bugabago?

 




 You're doing gods work there son, 




 There was a clip of the wedding where they were shaking hands in front of the cake..

Hank is so square and PG that it just makes his character funnier. 




 This one actually made me laugh out loud. Well done 




 I'm sorry, but on Reddit the majority come across just like he did 




 Settle down there Neck beard.

r/atheism wants you back over there.

Fucking atheists are worse than hardcore religious types. 




 Lol you know some of the words I said? :)

Mate, I'm happy to help you out with whatever you need to get started, PM me any questions you may have.. I started off on the evod and every single step between till I found my mech mod and tank that I love.

 




 I literally just drove back from Qld, I spent the whole weekend Vaping, and not a word said by anyone.

The only thing I heard was someone whispering 'look at his ecig thing.. Its a bit big' - had my nemesis running an 18650 and a Kayfun. 




 My dad was using YouTube to Google search up until 6 months ago.. No matter how much explaining I do, it will all just be jargon.

He knows the 'Blue E' is how he gets to Google.  




 This is what I worry about on a daily basis 




 It might, but it works a lot cleaner and smoother than IE 




 Haha I did that with Chrome. 

Its cut the 'what's wrong with the computer?' Phone calls by over 80% 




 Count me in as a PM target as well, happy to chat and with some experience behind me (personal) 




 Flick me a PM mate, I'm now 30, all was going well in life for me until s lot of crap came my way and sent me in a spiral. There is light on the other end and I'd be happy to chat with you whenever you feel. Anytime. 




 I was home for a week with a bad flu, did 1-13 in a row! 




 There is more to every story than what the media portrays to you.

There is always a LOT more.

In the case of Aborigines, unfortunately, the majority ruin it for the minority, and not the other way around.

There are a lot that genuinely try hard, are successful, and lead a great life.. Then there are the ones that take everything for granted, get given everything on a silver platter, get free housing, free schooling, free medical, free or heavily subsidised EVERYTHING, and still manage to ruin it and disrespect it.

I'm not racist towards any race in particular, I'm equally racist towards everyone. 




 Oh really?.. 

Don't worry about WA, go for a walk through redfern and then tell me how many 'Aboriginals' even deserve to see a doctor (paid for with my tax dollars)

This is a bait thread.

 




 Because, too-tsunami must not use the phone! 




 Will this work at officeworks in Australia? :(

We rebadged your store. 




 The commercials here in Aus always state 'if you're a non smoker, the average price will be...' Technically I'm not a smoker.. Considering its not smoke I'm inhaling. 




 www.nicvape.com - buy the nicotine, then support your local vape shops and buy juice here.. It tastes awesome and you'll get it straight away. 




 The ironic part of it is, this table doesn't exist in Aus..  




 Fedora, Trilby, same-same.

Still tacky as hell. 




 Well... I guess you are!

Where's your falcon? 




 Shi SHAAAAAH!, Squirrel Tactics! 




 We are just backing up the internet in case it breaks one day.... 




 No!, this is why his wife left him, and why he's fat, and Bald. 




 OBJECTURE! 




 I am Dale, shut up Bill. 




 I'm sorry, but I'm a stickler for finishes, and they way you have that installed looks absolutely horrible.

You could've at least used clear tape and not that bright blue painting masking tape.

 




 Haha 




 I'm doing 3ml a day at the moment... In a Kayfun 




 I thought that was Dennis Leary 




 For the life of me, I've never heard of someone polishing off a 15ml bottle of juice in a day!

That used to last me 2 weeks in my Evod! 




 The only company that hasn't fucked me around yet is nicvape. 




 What's wrong with the button?

All I did was the magnet upgrade and it didn't even need that 




 Most reliable for me is my Nemesis clone and the Kayfun clone. 

There isn't anything to really malfunction here.

Most reliable VV has been my SVD with a protank 2, and least reliable is my Sigelei Zmax v5. 




 Google it! 




 That's horrible. 




 Can vouch, watched a few docos on those guys.. Seriously evil bunch. 




 They MS13 for short? 




 Ohh nooo.. The card says Moops! 




 Moops 




 This video doesn't show a crazy girlfriend, it's just a video of a soft-cock that will always be treated like one if he keeps this up. 




 Never really knew remixes like this existed, some of the other tracks are even better  




 Because they're a bunch of fucks that were raised in a shitty family and were starved for attention.

Now that they're grown up, they'll do anything to get that attention, even if it means making others suffer.

I hold a special place for people like this piece of shit, and it's called 'I hope he gets hit by a car driven by that boys parents'.  




 No lie, everyone has their own beholder. 

You may not be attractive to one person but you may be very attractive to another. 

So, I_have_so_many_names - you're a beautiful person too. 




 Don't stress OP, I think you're pretty / handsome in your own little way. 

Everyone is.

 




 Anyone have a list of their own personal Dale Gribble episodes they recommend?

Shi Shaaaa! 




 The Amiga 500 




 He might've been checking if the grass really was greener on the other side? 




 All I need now is a portable Amiga 500 




 Hucci - Cashmere.

The best part of the track is in the video.. The rest of it is pretty ordinary 




 Hey bud, you've become my favourite reviewer. Keep up the good work and humour!! 




 Or that being too clever can make you look like an asshole. 




 I've so far seen a guy jam an elephant sized dildo up his ass, a hand blown off, a hole in someone's face, all whilst I've been in this sub.. 

This has been the most mentally disturbing one of all, it had me physically cringing as well.

Those kids will be mentally scarred for life  




 That is some interesting info and thank you.

I've seen the hardware get better and better, and with the new software and control it will bring, hopefully the 2 can  match.

The OS is where it needs to be from a look and feel perspective, its buttery smooth, its fast, and now can work on minimal hardware specs. Its about time they sort out the camera. 




 Boop 




 Really though? Isn't it just another interface lift? I haven't really seen much posted about camera improvements on the N5, hoping someone running L can verify the difference for me, if any..
