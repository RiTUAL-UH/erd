 Living in Olympia WA geology is in your face and after reading McPhee I've got the bug. I am working through *Earth* 10th ed by Tarbuck *et al*, several books by David Alt *et al*.

When I get some time I'd like to ramble around the scablands; any recommended spots? Thx!

 Stan Laurel was also a superb mime. He'd worked Music Halls with Chaplin (he was his understudy) in London before they both emigrated. 



















 Jackman's Australian. Perhaps they're related. 
























 And Beck appears to be a bit less in your face about it. Still diminishes my appreciation of Beck, though.
