 I always wandered: I am not from America. Does this 499 include your sales tax? If not, how much do you end up paying,  say, in Houston?  




 Most people won't even stand where that car is in the picture.  




 I've got one for you. Maybe not original but at least never heard of it. 

You know how Google Picasa and other softwares ask you to tell them what the name of a face is that the software recognises on your pics? It is linked to a contact in your phone. In case you save your contacts with full name they know the name of that person and their face (also tel no and possibly email,  bla bla bla). Now as soon as the software knows the name and possible waits for a verification from a different user they start tracking where ever that person was. Somebody is taking a picture of something with me in the background? Picasa saves geo data and tells Google where I was that day at that time. This way a map is created of where I went with evidence. Could be used to prove you haven't done this or that but it will only be used against you.  




 Op, please share how you took and edited the picture  




 Pacific Rim. 
Everything about the movie sucks. Worst:

Acting

The fact that the monsters don't use their emp's straight away

That one of the jagers uses a boat instead of the awesome sword he apparently has 




 I down vote you for the second part of your post. What are trying to do? Shame people into not down voting you?  




 If you don't like it you don't like it, that's fine. But for me it is one of the most important things I have ever watched. Two of the main characters, Jack and Daniel, have actually influenced me a lot. I still think that trying to be a bit of both will make the perfect human being. The two of them unite traditional values and open-mindedness perfectly. They are and forever will be my role models.

 Thank you for pointing out my error. Got it now.  




 Sorry, I did not read galaxy. I read universe. Sorry for the question.  




 When we do such an estimation, does that include observable universe only or more than that. In case of the latter, how do we estimate? 

Edit: sorry, my bad. I read universe, not galaxy.  




 Thank you! 




 I have 0% knowledge but I am willing to learn hard. 

If you could help me get started I would be very grateful.  




 I went to a Nike outlet to buy some running shirts and shorts and saw that the Nike Hyperfeel were only 80 so I bought a pair. I ran in them today and I liked it. 

By chance I walked past my usual shop and went in because I was curious what my usual salesman had to say about them. 

Long story short. He said that:
- Nike uses some of the worst foams in the industry which don't provide good support
- He has a ton of customers that came into his shop because they have trouble with their achilles tendon and their knees after using any nike free run shoes. 
- Even walking for long periods of time is bad for knees and achilles tendon. He said that if I run with them (I am quite heavy and mostly land on the back of my foot) I will have problems in the future with my hip and knees
- They basically are a shit shoe that costs nothing to make (he said $2.50 but I am not sure if he was just saying a low number) and is being sold with a ridiculous profit margin thanks to Nike's marketing.
- it has been developed in Germany at the Sporthochschule Koeln and that some people involved make their money with knee replacements
- on top of all of that he does not sell Nike because for him it is a fact that they use child labour (however he does realise that this is a difficult discussion. Anyway it is his shop so it's his choice)

He was able to explain everything very well and I have to say that I believe him but I could not find anything online so I am curious where he gets this information. 

What do you gusy think? 




 Why is that? What alternative is there that is better? Rotten tomatoes, where toy story 3 is the best movie of all time?  




 I really do 




 God I was scared when I saw I had a message but I thinks it's so good and nice. This is everything I wanted.. I showed her and she was so surprised. She doesn't know reddit and thought it would all be crap. Thank you so much.

 Yeah, sounds pretty amazing.  









 I just love Germany sometimes.

 NB looks a LOT cheaper than Nike.  




 I don't actually. And if I am honest, I don't even know what that is. Considering my wrist hurts right now, I guess I will be reading up on that tonight. 

Thanks for the advice 




 Sorry, the sandals. I'm sure they are not because I guess people would not recommend them.  




 Yeah, I saw that just now. What the hell. 

I guess I'll just keep using my running shoes then.  




 Thanks. I'll consider it. 

They look difficult to run in if you ask me.  




 My GF made that same experience. If you need to get started with easier exercise I recommend this. It's the all time top post here. It is what I am doing and I really love it. I am sure the easiest exercises will be fine for anybody.

 Hmm, I am done in about 1 hour - 1 hour 20 mins. 
I run 5 mins, do 

handstand 3 sets

push ups 3 sets

squats 3 set

pull ups 3 sets

leg raises 3 sets

vertical pulls 3 sets

then I run for 20 minutes and then stretch for 5. 

I feel like 2 hours would kill me.  




 I prefer shoes. It does not have to be THAT inexpensive. I am also not a fan of blisters. 




 Any recommendation for some inexpensive shoes for this? 




 I hate horse girls.

I would have not expected that from this guy... 




 Thank you for posting this. I wanted to ask you to share. How long did it actually take? 




 Haha! 
Love it.  




 I want to live in Asia, North and South America and Australia for at least a year each. I think it must be so enriching to experience the differences and would surely make you more understanding.  




 I mean that parents fail to teach this and children who don't look so cool or don't have a smartphone seem to fall behind even if they are super nice people.  




 Old people (40+) like me, which is a massive advantage at work.  




 They invited you, so you can't be that bad of a candidate. They are testing you, play along. 




 Treat people based on how they behave, not how they look or what they have. This is becoming a problem.  




 And it is true 




 In the summer: White Wine Spritzer

I get a lot of shit from my mates... 




 Because they are confident. People always say this. From my point of view there is so much more to this:

- The woman you are talking about could be a dickhead too
- Maybe the guy just looks like a douche but is actually nice and not at all a dick. I have met guys like that. But maybe they are confident and that's why you think they are, well, what you said above
- I know lots of women who are not with the type of guy you are talking about even though they are fit. You are probably paying more attention to people who confirm your suspicion. 
- Confidence makes really sexy and these guys have a lot of that.  




 Why do they always try to push boundaries? 




 Ask them something stupidly arrogant but at the same time make sure your question show that you do not actually understand yourself, like:

What is a prime number of 5?

See how she/he reacts.  




 I did and I hate myself for it. 

Edit: Ah sorry, I am not married. It was/is my GF.  




 A friend of mine works as a flight attendant. After the flight she has to hold up a basket with tiny chocolates. So many people think they are so funny when they say:

"I'll take the whole basket!" whilst making a move for it and stopping just before they actually touch it.

 The article mentions real antisemitic happenings. However the "Zentralrat der Juden" in Germany is not differentiating. For them it is all them same it seems. Everybody who opposes Israel is an antisemit. They are calling for solidarity ([here](http://www.tagesspiegel.de/meinung/zentralrat-der-juden-fordert-mehr-solidaritaet-das-hier-ist-deutschland-2014-nicht-1938/10276918.html) in German) which is ridiculous. 

Not that I am saying any jewish people anywhere in the world shuld feel unsafe because of the actions of the Israeli government. However the "Zentralrat der Juden" a powerful Jewish organisation is, like the Israeli government, immune to reason and accountability.   




 Ok, that is awful. I did not know about this.  




 Forget about the evil merchant. The Israeli government is currently killing children in Gaza as far as I know. 

It is not the right way to go about it though. I do agree with that.  




 Well, same thing happened to Merkel being compared to Hitler. There are always some idiots. But I understand there is also some "well behaved" criticism that Israel does not want to accept.   




 http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2c8i8w/nato_bombed_5000_civilians_in_kosovo_just_because/

For example. I have read something similar in Der Spiegel. 




 The way I see it Israel is trying to shame people into being quite about what Israel is doing to the people living in Gaza. 

Just because the people in Israel who commit these crimes are Jewish does not mean that people who oppose them are being antisemitic. 









 I really like Marc O'Polo ()

It's kind of hard to get outside of Germany but the quality is amazing and the stuff looks brillian.  




 When you post, please also post webaddress of online shops and price

 = not so cheap (Nike)
= really not cheap at all (Ralph Lauren)
 = expensive (you know, the stuff nobody buys)

I would love to get to know some cool brand not everybody knows. 
 




 Was it really? I just ignored it because I was a bit annoyed with the fact it does not end.  




 Installed it, love it!

Thanks! 




 I am using an HTC One M7 with SentinelRom 6.0. It is based on CM11. Do you guys know how I can integrate all my facebook contacts and calendars?

I would really appreciate some help.  




 I have been doing bodyweight fitness for a short while now and I really like it. I feel good because I am doing something to improve my body. I cannot yet see a big difference but the fact that I am working out regularly makes a big difference to my state of mind. However, there is a downside. Well, two actually.

1. My thighs have become bigger and now my suits do not fit me anymore. I can almost not wear my trousers anymore when I have my phone and wallet in my pockets. 

2. I am not sure if I am imagining this, but because there is less space available between my thighs and also in my trousers, my testicles started hurting. 

Has anybody had a similar experience? 
Any suggestions how to deal with it? 

BTW second problem is much worse than number 1.  




 Hi,

I am trying to use the kernel for the SentinelRom 6.0 provided by the dev

https://github.com/CyanogenMod-11/android_kernel_htc_m7

But I do not know how. I understand that you need the zip and need to flash it in the recovery. I downloaded the zip on that page (right side of the screen) but it always says failed, when I try to flash it. 

Do you guys know how to do it?

Many thanks in advance.

 I find imdb.com incredibly useful to get information about movies I might want to watch and also I like to idea of keeping a record of what I have watched and how I liked the movie right after I watched it. 

I would love to know if there is anything similar.  














 Like said I got it as a present which is why I am reading it. 

I saw that it has 7000 reviews on amazon.co.uk with 4.5 stars average which I think means that it is a very popular book. Also I heard lots of people talk about it. 

I have read the first 80 pages and really struggle to keep reading. The reasons are:

- The life of the protagonist seems super unrealistic. I read it and think that even though I know it's fiction there is no way I can believe this story or identify myself with it. 
- The jokes he makes seem calculated and also it seems like it's not genuine. It seems like he has taken the kind of humour from somebody else because it was successful.
- Last but not least I read, that he wote a second book which follows the exact same scematic as this one. I dislike that because it lacks heart. 

What do you gusy think? Shall I keep reading? 














 Hey guys, 

I have started bodyweight fitness but would like to learn a bit more about the results that I can expect if I am diligent. 

My primary goal is not to gain strength for the sake of it. I would say that I don't lack strength because I have always been working out. I am a little too fat though and I find that I cannot move the way I would like to because of it.

My goal is to get rid of some of my fat and get lean. I do not actually want to get a lot bigger because I have very wide shoulders as it is and I am quite short. I have started the routine that is suggested in one of the top posts (the one that has a picture of all the different progressions in it. I was able to star pretty much everything in the middle.

I would love to know if other people had the same goal and if they succeeded.

Oh, and I want to be able to do one armed push ups, of course. ;)

I'd appreciate any feedback. Progression picks always good 














 I was just thinking, if we were to colonize for example Mars, could we actually fly planes there? 

















































 I really like to see people's handwriting. I have seen some really beautiful ones and it always amazes me. [Here](http://imgur.com/m2545wF) is mine FYI.

Apparently it contains every letter of the alphabet. I did not bother to check... 




 I moved to London 2 years ago and have been working quite a lot. 

I would like to get back to making music. Anybody interested? I produce hip hop and r b. I would love to meet singers or writers. 

Let me know if you're interested. 

Maybe you can meet somebody else here who in interested in your type of music too.  




 So, I have been reading some books and saw one video trying to explain 11 dimensions. Then I had a though. I am really not good at explaining it but I'll try my best.

Maybe the universe is not actually endless, it is just a closed loop. Imagine somebody who is only able to perceive 1 dimension. his world looks like this ------------ . He can move left and right. If you put both ends of his world together you get a circle. Now if the person would walk left (or right) for long enough he would realise he is living on a cirlce because he will get back to the start. Now if the circle is bigger than the person can travel in a lifetime, he will never get back to the start and will therefore think his universe in endless. 

If you apply the same to a 2D world the person can walk left, right, up and down. Again, his world might seem endless to him, but in fact it might just be a sphere too big for him to travel across in one lifetime. 

Now what if that is the same with our universe? Maybe it is actually folded in such a way that whichever direction you traveled you would eventually get back to Earth. Because we live in it and cannot perceive the next dimension up, our minds cannot picture such a folded 3D object but that doesn't mean its not possible. 

For me this would be much easier to understand that to grasp infinity.

I hope I explained myself good enough for people to understand. 

TL;DR: Universe is not actually infinite, just a folded 3D onject (similar to a circle in 1D and a sphere in 2D). We will just never find out because it is too big for us to travel. 

What do you think? 










































































 Religious people might object, but as I see it, there is no universal authority that determines "If you do this, then this should happen to you."  




 I think it would be interesting to know:
How much do people earn on average (maybe you can estimate)
How much rent do you pay (is that in the expensive or cheap part of town?)
How much does it cost to go out? 




 I would like to know what features you like that your system does not have, but the other one does.  


































 Even taking into consideration that 2D maps are not accurately showing the world and that Earth is not a perfect sphere, I do not understand why a plane would fly over the sea north of Russia to get from London to Tokyo (for example). Please, can somebody explain? 
























 Thanks for that. I can't believe that happened.  




 Whatever, then. I'm not interested then.  




 Not one person here can tell me how tall or heavy they are in metric units, bro. Also people measure their dicksize in inches, bro.

 Hi guys, is there anything like the auto hibernation of greenify for non rooted phones? (z3c) 




 It is not only because there are other 5+ inch devices that are also good. It's because a big screen phone is nothing new. But a phone that you can use with one hand which has a great battery life and still is a flagship has not been seen so far  




 I am curious what rich people think poor (poorer) people are doing that is stupid or unreasonable. Why do you think they are poor or not as rich as you.

Anything goes.  




 Thanks 




 Cool. Thanks. That is what I was hoping for.  




 ah, ok. I started with a little under 84kg and now I am at 81. I read that losing 0.5kg per week is not healthy and realistic. I have been working out for more than 2 months now. 

Actually, writing it down it seems perfectly fine progress. 

I am not actually a beginner. I have worked out very irregularly the last 3 years. but I am not weak. 

No idea about bf%. I don;t know where to measure that. 
My TDEE with no excercise is 2100 and I eat 1600 a day. However I do work out 3 times a week. 

I appreciate you taking the time.  




 He is right. But what got me started was this because it is easy to start with and does not require any effort to get started. 

Some don't like bodyweightfitness but it is much better than doing nothing. 
http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1vupz1/rbodyweightfitness_it_has_taken_me_quite_a_while/ 




 go on... 




 so, this site tells me (depending on how much exercise I do, light or moderate) that I should eat 2400kcal (light exercise) or 2700kcal (moderate exercise) to maintain my weight. I am currently working out 3 times a week and trying to eat 1600kcal per day. Should I eat more than that to maintain my muscle?

edit: 174cm, 81.5kg, 30 years old male. 

and thank you btw.  




 Hey, thank you also for replying. I have also said this to somebody else. I would like to generally understand the workings of the body. I appreciate that some people are different. But I would like to know generally what eating at a deficit/surplus does to your body when you workout/don't workout.  




 Hey, thanks for replying. Basically, what I was aiming at was to gather knowledge. I just want to understand the principles of gaining/losing weight and gaining/losing muscle. 

But I am 174cm tall, weight 81.5kg am 30 years old and currently eat 1650 kcal a day. I am working out 3 times per week (bodyweightfitness) 




 Hello,

I have tried to ask this in /r/bodyweightfitness but had little luck. I think it might be interesting for many people so I am trying here one more time. 

Please could we collect information on what will happen in the following cases:

(Please assume the following just for the sake of an easy explanation: 2000kcal required for maintenance.)

Cases:

a) eating 1500kcal per day not working out

b) eating 1500kcal per day but working out (at least 3 times per week)

c) eating 2000kcal per day not working out

d) eating 2000kcal per day but working out (at least 3 times per week)

e) eating 2500kcal per day not working out

f) eating 2500kcal per day but working out (at least 3 times per week)

In all of these cases, what will happen to fat and muscle, will it increase, decrease or stay the same?

__

What I am assuming is this, but I think I might be wrong:

a) eating 1500kcal per day not working out

Amount of muscle: will decrease

Amount of fat: will decrease

b) eating 1500kcal per day but working out (at least 3 times per week)

Amount of muscle: will increase slightly

Amount of fat: will decrease

c) eating 2000kcal per day not working out

Amount of muscle: will decrease slightly

Amount of fat: will not change / increase slightly

d) eating 2000kcal per day but working out (at least 3 times per week)

Amount of muscle: will increase slightly

Amount of fat: will decrease slightly

e) eating 2500kcal per day not working out

Amount of muscle: will decrease slightly

Amount of fat: will increase

f) eating 2500kcal per day but working out (at least 3 times per week)

Amount of muscle: will increase

Amount of fat: will increase slightly

__

I would be really thankful if you guys could provide some information. Because at the moment I am not reaching my goals. I am eating -500kcal per day and doing bodyweightfitness 3 times a week . I am losing weight very slowly and hardly putting on any muscle. I am getting stronger though. However I would like to lose fat and gain muscle.

Many thanks in advance.

EDIT: 174cm, 81.5kg, 30yo male.  




 God, this sucks. 




 Why is that? 









 Free Internet porn.
For sure. Have you seen family guy? Even 1st would people who find out about it can't believe it at first

 Apparently it is a LINE feature. What a coincidence.  




 Oh, ok. What a twist 




 Sorry, does great not mean better than good anymore? 




 Ah, alright. My SO has a MOTO G and I saw that on her phone when she gets a message through LINE. I though it was a LINE feature. 

Thank you.  




 Did you drug your dog to post him on the internet? 




 That is not correct either. It's just that Japanese idealize it. In the Japanese culture there are a few things everybody wants to do and Paris (or Mt Saint Michel for example) is one of them. It is being portrayed in a way that is completely unrealistic and people kind of expect a Disney Land like experience. Also it is not like this applies to the majority of Japanese. I think it is just a few idiots with no sense of reality who fall for the unrealistic image of Paris.    




 Yes, I agree. When you go to Paris with a Parisian and he shows you places where its not horrifically expensive it is amazing. French food and wine is worth the trip alone and in the Summer people in Paris sit by the river and drink all day long like students.   




 It's BS. I have been many times and whilst it has it's downsides (dirty, rude, dangerous at night near train stations or in the outer areas) it is amazing. Paris is absolutely worth going to, you just need to know its not all sunshine and gummy bears.  




 Don't forget the unbelievably rude Parisians.  




 I have that phone. The battery is great but it's not really 2 days. Seriously  




 I've got the z3c. Can I also do that? UK? 




 Sorry, what is active display? 




 And to commute to work? 




 Just by it from the UK.  Clove.Co.uk 




 Guess what: The blue lights are the only reason I think they look like Tron.  




 Fair enough. I think you have a point. But Sheldon is annoying as fuck and not entertaining. 




 He just becomes more and more ignorant to the fact he's annoying and that everything he says is rude. He has no periods where he is normal at all anymore  




 I feel like he is not saying single normal sentence anymore. 









 Cool thanks you. I'll do that  




 Thank you. Any good alternative to City Mapper for London? It eats battery  




 A little better than mine. 

Personally I do not like blue flowers a lot, but the pictures are nice. 




 I have to admit that the focus is not good though. 









 I am surprised this doesn't get more love. I think it is awesome. Really nice colours! 




 This would be a good phone wallpaper. 




 Sweet.  




 I am jealous. I where is this?

Edit: God, I do not read. It says where it is in the title. Sorry.  




 You're in good company  




 Is my understanding correct, that all the stars I see around the galaxy are stars from the milky way that are between that Sombrero Galaxy and us? 




 You don't like that? Don't buy it. Jesus Christ 




 Get the HTC M7 then. Full HD 4.7" , premium material. Stil quick enough for all you want to do. I used to have that phone. I also love the sense UI. I only changed to the z3c because of the battery and camera. I don't regret my choice. 

But keep in mind that the HTC One M7 only has a 0.1" bigger screen, but it also has the back and home button separate. The z3c has them on the screen. That means you get a screen with is 0.1" smaller and is also occupied by the navigation button at the bottom.  




 So, I also had the HTC M7 which is amazing in terms of looks and feel. I now have the black z3c and I love it. The plastic rim is nothing like the one of the HTC One M7 mini. It will nevrev bother me. I am sure about that. It is a bit see through so it does not look like cheap plastic at all.  




 Why do you recommend turning the X reality off? 




 I used to run 20 minutes before every workout. But I was a bit knackered afterwards for the workout. Now I run on different days and do 30-40 minutes. I HATE running but I feel so good after continously doing it 




 He means doing push ups one day and dips on the next. That's what start bodyweight recommends. 




 So, just to make it clear (because I am not seeing much progress):

Go all the way down until you just hang there with a straight arm? 




 What? I paid 10 for a pair. Shit

Edit: [Proof](http://www.tmlewin.co.uk/Metal-Collar-Bones-6.5cm/505097552699,en_GB,pd.html?prefn1=categoryCIMS start=0 cgid=Mens-Shirt-Accessories prefv1=Collar%20Bones). But of course this pair comes with a nice bag.  









 I thought that before. That should work. 




 I wanted 4 years of my life on this shit. No more 




 Exactly  




 True, but for me that does not justify being a dick

Edit: actually I just thought about it. Not necessarily. If everybody else would not tolerate that one asshole there would be no problem. 
 




 I do understand that very well, thank you. You are saying that people won't behave the way I suggest because it would only benefit them if everyone else also behaved that way. However it seems more likely to people that even if they behave correctly, everyone else won't thus putting themselves at a disadvantage. Therefore, they also behave incorrectly.

However, somebody needs to do the first step and bite the bullet. However it seems to me you won't be the one. 




 I disagree. People have high expectations for EVERYTHING. The way they get talked to by waiters, how their boss should behave, how their children should respect them, how they deserve this and should not be treated in this way... the list is endless. 

And that's all fine, if they are willing to treat people in the same way in return.  




 No, just "give what you expect to get". 




 Says everybody who is not willing to do the first step. 




 Sounds interesting.  Might actually give it a try  




 Just tried a few times. It's pretty much instantly if you use the touch screen. The hardware button is much slower though.

Edit: just realised, instantly is not specific. I think honestly, you can press the camera button, focus and take the pic in a second  




 Haha, you dick.  :) 




 Not sure if you are asking if I have regrets. But if you are, then:

I always think that every wrong decision is fine as long as at the time I made it, it seemed like the right decision considering what I knew then. I don't regret these decisions. 

Every time I was warned and did it anyway, those are the moments I regret.  




 Sort it out maybe? 




 Everybody should stop fucking people over for money. 

The problem is that even though you are in a position where you can get rich by:

- using inferior ingredients in the food you sell
- charging too much for your shitting product
- spying on people and then selling the data
- bla 
- bla 
- bla

The same thing is happening to you all the time because there are others out there who do the same. If everybody stopped doing it we could all live better lives. 




 Please make my life better. 




 I feel like everybody could end up being mentioned in here. People always think everybody else is stupid.  




 So white! 




 Sorry, that's not what I meant. 




 Cool. I'll give it a shot.

Thanks 




 Sorry to hear that. Maybe I was lucky then, I honestly dropped it more than 10 times. 




 I agree with you 100%. 

A person who has made a mistake should always have a second chance (hopefully they learn from it). I also believe that this forgetting thing only works after a long time anyway. 

However a company should have to provide an address, just to make sure they are not doing any shady stuff. I mean if your apps are legit, then there is no problem with that anyway.  




 I totally understand that. But my fingers are too short for the big screen.  




 why have you got duplicates?
I don't understand.  




 I bought if for 350. The compact, but I don't think that is expensive for a good phone.  




 Z3 compact has a burst mode. You click once, it take about 20 pictures and you select the best one. I have only tried it without actually wanting to take a picture but seems to be working fine.  




 I had a HTC One M7, dropped it a million time. I few bends, but the phone does not break even without a case. I loved the phone, because of Sense. Best UI in my eyes. But the battery life was terrible. I now got a Z3 compact and I think I will love it. No case either. Battery seems good, but I don't see it as being as amazing as everybody says.  




 How do you know?  




 Cool thanks  




 It's BS. Use street view and you will see that a lot of the outer areas of "greater Tokyo" are just farmland. 

It is not a good comparison because there are no "rules" for calling an area greater XXX. If they wanted they could call the whole of South West England greater London. 

Edit: Just look at the marked area here. It is just hills and forest. Same with all North East of it.

 Has anybody seen a good example? I haven't. 

What kind of stuff do you look for? 




 I feel like the brackets are UNNECESSARY

 I agree. What does it matter what it says on the spec sheet. If it looks good, I'm fine with it.  




 Yep, my HTC One M7 is dead by the time I get on the bus home.  




 Nah, unfortunately they are simply not big enough. 

For example [this one](http://38.media.tumblr.com/45ff3d004d94899ba4d9cd907b0f7d17/tumblr_nadyoe0ilY1rtbxrwo1_500.jpg) is awesome, but the res is 500x750. No chance unfortunately. I don't think all the pictures have the same resolution, but none are big enough. 

I love the pictures though.

 Haha! 




 Are you serious? There have been over 1000 fatalities so far. Survival rate is 10%. The whole of western Africa is about to collapse because of it.

 I just saw there is a transort tycoon, not OPenTTD. Just baught it. Will give it a shot
 




 Thanks. I'll give it a try.  




 Cool. Did not know. Thanks.  














 Is it me or is the resolution way too small to use the pictures as wallpapers? 




 I really think it is too tight at the bottom, no? 









 Ok. Did not realise that. Thanks for sharing  




 First of all: amazing work. It looks brilliant and I love the idea. 
Can I ask what you are planning to integrate apart from Fb (which I don't really read) and twitter (which I don't really use?). Are you going to I crude an RSS reader? Or reddit? If that would be the case I'd be super interested in using it. 

However I also think it would be better if it was an launcher with a dedicated home screen where I can add my widgets. 

Or maybe slide left to a screen where you can only add widgets which can also be scrolled down just like the app drawer? Then it would be everything I need.  




 You are right, but I think it's fair to assume that by hold he means use. Why would you just hold a phone? I can also hold a 10 inch tablet in one hand but that information is pretty useless...  




 So, just accept nothing is ever going to change?  




 Does make a difference though. I always thought "Why is everything so cheap in Amercia?" But it seems it isn't.

Thanks 




 Pretty sure that was the plan.
