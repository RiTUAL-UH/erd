 First off, I'm the representative for the CoS on this sub.   
You're asking some leading questions here. What do you consider "active"? What do you the expect the Church of Satan to do for you? The Church of Satan is an organization of individuals, all of whom share a base common ground on the acceptance of Satanism and works of LaVey, but beyond that our members vary in political, philosophical, and personal interests. For the Church of Satan to act as a group in many cases is illogical and counter productive towards our members. Instead, the Church of Satan will promote the individual activities of individual members so long as it has it is in agreement with Satanism.   

The goals of the Church of Satan are to maintain the works of LaVey, to promote the activities of publicly open Satanists who affiliate with the Church of Satan and apply Satanism to the real world, and to push for the Pentagonal Revisionism. These are the only political/social goals for the COS as a group. For details on this, see LaVey's article: http://www.churchofsatan.com/pentagonal-revisionism.php  

Here is Magistra Blanche Barton's update on the program: http://www.churchofsatan.com/five-point-plan-revisited.php  


Speaking of Barton, she just did presentation on the history of the Church of Satan and its role in secularism as part of a larger forum on the history of secular humanism in San Diego. This was 3 weeks ago.  

The Church of Satan is pragmatic and realistic. We know that certain goals cannot be attained by waving a Sigil of Baphomet banner. You have to get into the system and work it from the inside, and we have many members doing just this. In certain situations we will work with other organizations openly, like we have with the Center for Inquiry.   

I'm often referred to public rituals as an indicator for "activity". LaVey publicized Church of Satan rituals in the early days (late 60's, early 70's), but then locked the doors and did not perform any public rituals for the rest of his life. Since LaVey's passing there have been a handful of public Satanic rituals, including the 6/6/6 Satanic Mass at the Center for Inquiry, and a public celebration of Dashwood and the Hellfire Club at the Hellfire Caves in Southeast England. Keep in mind, a "Satanic ritual" does not need to be a group of robed men surrounding an altar. The goal of Satanic ritual is to cause change in the real world, and this can be done through a powerful speech or a moving musical performance. Many of our members have preferred this method, and we're out there more and more.  

About the fee: Satanists are material, pragmatic, and carnal. We do not believe in selling souls and empty blessings. We will not fool you into thinking we're a charity and that our time is without value. Support is material, and most easily represented in the form of monetary funds. What is done with this? By and large it's to cover administrative expenses, costs of media representation, legal expenses, and various technical expenses. And that's after we paid the taxes, which we believe all religious organizations should do. I've spent time with the Church of Satan's High Priest and Priestess and there is A LOT that needs to get done on a day-to-day basis. When a couple of idiots kill someone in the name of Satan and the media catches wind of it, guess who gets called? Yes, we have the FBI and local police on speed dial. This takes time, effort, and money. And like you say, it's not a whole lot of it for a lifetime membership. I just spent this much buying records today. What are you going to get out your membership? Nothing if you sit around waiting for something to be handed to you. Do you want to work with other Satanists who may share common interests or real world goals? I know many members who've done just that, professionally, artistically, and academically. It's up to you to decide how much you want to be active or inactive. We have a number of members who tipped their hat and go along their way, applying Satanism in their activities without declaring themselves as Satanists.  




 Charles Manson said he was the second coming of Christ. People say a lot of things, especially people who aren't chemically balanced.  




 Just because the media reports something as "Satanic" doesn't make it so. The kid was obviously a nutcase, enough said. Nothing to do with Satanism at all. There is no such thing as selling your soul to anything. If ANYONE believes otherwise they are delusuonal and have no rational, philosophical, or metaphysical ground to stand on. Period. 









 1. You have a fundamental misunderstanding of "indulgence" if you equate it to hedonism. What's wrong with being at peace and wanting to relax? As LaVey recalls of Catism, "He who sleeps the day away, lives to sleep another day".  

2. Satanists except themselves for who they are. If they feel that their potential is not fully realized, they may work towards achieving that, so far as it's fun. Happiness and being content with oneself is true Satanism.  

3. The Satanic Bible is bombastic, it's meant to trigger instinctual reactions. These can be either positive and or negative. LaVey even described it as a necessary style for the time. He was inspired by the philosophy of Voltaire, who believed small, concise but powerful tracts would inspire revolutions. The Satanic Bible is bedrock, foundation, upon which further study is necessary. Some call this Deep Satanism, and the Church of Satan encourages those who wish to further the philosophy of Satanism to study Western philosophy, religion, anthropology, the natural sciences, and history. Was "turn the other cheek" an aggressive taunt for the Romans? Maybe, but that was not the context in which Jesus taught. See his Beatitudes.  

4. Satanism rejects self-deception. Satanism is a religion. Not all religions are simply self-deception. Ask yourself, how big of a role did Christianity play in maintaining slavery and discrimination in comparison with how it helped? I would argue that such movements had much more to do with economic outcomes than spiritualism (see The Economics of the Civil Rights Revolution by Gavin Wright, Stanford University)  

5. "I feel Satanism has become stagnant over the years since Dr. LaVey's death." Huh? As someone who's been involved in Satanism and the activities of the Church of Satan since the late 90's I can't understand how people continue to proclaim this. Major gatherings? Which major gatherings? What do you consider major? What do you define as "stagnant" or "active"? Performing public rituals? More public rituals have been performed in the past 6 years than in the last 20 of LaVey's life. I promoted an event here on this sub for a musical event in NYC that featured a number of Satanists, that was heavily attended by the Church of Satan, and it sold out the venue. And if you grasped the most basic fundamentals of Satanism you would have caught on what was presented on stage, and many have. So either you're looking in the wrong places or you willfully have your head in the sand. 




 I also have no interest in a flame war, but I will not leave sloppy logic unchallenged. There are fundamental first principles we will disagree on and I do not hide these biases, but they are clearly defined. I ask for the same from others who usually retort with "don't tell me what to do!" or "occult mysteries".  




 Protestants call themselves protestants, and would say Catholics are improper Christians at best, and they often argue that Catholics are not Christians at all. In fact, both parties call each other satanic.  

"The term was used to describe a certain set of beliefs for a very long time."  

By who? As far as I can tell, the terms "satanism" and "satanic" were used by the Abrahamic religions as a derogatory term, or by Abrahamic heretics who chose to worship for the "other side" but always recognized and operated under Abrahamic cosmology, and very often reverting to standard dogma. 




 They are being theologically (according to their own "believed" mythologies) and philosophically (according to rational metaphysics) inconsistent. And that's being polite about it. 




 And this is why devil worship should be vehemently rebuked.  



















 The last symbol goes by various names, the Brimstone Cross, Leviathan Cross, etc. It's based on the alchemical symbol for sulfur/brimstone, which comes from volcanos and hot springs, giving connotations of hellfire. In rituals it can used as a phallic symbol, or a symbol of fire and strength. The Brimstone Sigil is used by High Priest Peter Gilmore and is featured on limited edition of the [Satanic Scriptures](http://www.satanicscriptures.com/). 




 Funny how many Westerners who push the Buddhist idea of "love your enemy" come from pampered backgrounds. A fluffy ideal that has no place in the history of man, today or sixteen hundred years ago. Especially among Buddhists, who's very existence in many instances depended on hating your enemies. Unless you can say you love your enemies in your heart as you spear them.

This philosophy is suicidal. And that's not bashing it, this is exactly what it is. Let's not forget Gandhi. "Whenever you are confronted with an opponent. Conquer him with love." Who would tell the Jews that suicide is more heroic than fighting for your life: "But the Jews should have offered themselves to the butcher's knife. They should have thrown themselves into the sea from cliffs."   




 There are also a number of rituals in [High Priest Peter Gilmore's book The Satanic Scriptures](http://www.amazon.com/Satanic-Scriptures-Peter-H-Gilmore/dp/0976403595/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-7850525-6432757?ie=UTF8 s=books qid=1182438419 sr=8-1/churchofsatan). 




 And one more thing, there is no Satanic community. 




 The "Marriage to the Beast" is some bullshit spewed by David Icke and fanatical Christians. There is no such ritual in actual Satanism.  
  
If you want to see what a real Satanic ritual looks like take a look at this video of the Church of Satan's 6/6/6 event.  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1zsIk6WcNM 









 There aren't many "blogs" covering Satanism as defined by the Church of Satan. Most of the writers in our organization focus on books, magazines, and journalism that's not explicitly "Satanic". For example, Kevin Slaughter's [Underworld Amusements](http://www.underworldamusements.net/) publishes a number of books, including High Priest Gilmore's Satanic Scriptures. He also produces a number of video interviews and features.

 I was on board until the cheesy guitars kicked in. 




 Stephen O'Malley and Z'ev - Magistral is my favorite SUNN/SOMA related project   

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR_Fb_83KGI 














 Exactly. 




 From "Mirror, Mirror"  
"Instead, in publicly funded forums we support secular mementoes of the legacy of those who struggled to build this nation, not a plethora of conflicting belief systems. Individual Satanists also support the worthy efforts of groups such as the ACLU to combat religious encroachment on public grounds. I suspect other secularists are doing the same."  

How about a monument to the secularism of the founding fathers, or a monument declaring the separation of Church and State? Whatever the case may be, it should not be played out to make Satanism (and Satanists) look like a joke.  



















 Favorite proper Sunn album would be  Void. But favorite SOMA related release would have to be the Stephen O'Malley   Z'EV - Magistral album. 



















 When LaVey used the term "Psychic Vampire" he was not talking about anyone with mystical or magic(k)al powers. He was referring to what /u/magicnerd212 is describing. Another way a Psychic Vampire gets their hooks in you is via gifting. They hand you an unwanted or unexpected gift and then in turn expect a life-time of loyalty and free entry into your life. Beware.   

There are other uses of the term "Psychic Vampire" by various occultists and mystics, these are not the same thing.  




 And they didn't actually "invoice" the government, Cevin Key was explaining the concept of the "Weapon" title and their plan to make the image of the invoice their cover art. That fell through and didn't happen.  
http://www.liisaladouceur.com/blog/ogre-of-skinny-puppy-on-guantanamo-torture-and-music-as-a-weapon/    
"The project was about going as far as we could, then to present to the US government, or whoever we could find that was responsible for torturing people with our music, an actual invoice for what they owe us for using our music.  We would make the cover art the invoice. The idea of a free society to me, is not one that tortures people. I cant live with that, and not call it out." 




 I was invited to attend but couldn't make it. I got the video from Richard Devine's Twitter Feed: https://twitter.com/RichardDevine

"But lacking humor and perspective, lacking the satanic instinct, you stick to your levels and straight lines, squat there in the morass of your beatified illusions; and it is well for you thus, you mud-moles - bait that you are on the hooks of my venomous pride!" 














 It's a podcast episode for the show Vox Satanae. If you scroll down you can play the episode in your browser or download the MP3.   
You can get more episodes or subscribe to the show on iTunes here:

"Vox Satanae (Voice of Satan) presents classical music with an emphasis on vocal music from its inception through the present in all of its forms. Each show contains a variety of music in the areas of chant, choral, opera, song, theater, film, and instrumental for your listening enjoyment." 



















 LaVey was optimistic about the general population embracing Satanism in the early years of the Church of Satan. He was right in that faith in Christianity was in decline, but instead of liberation, the masses sought another master, the television. You can see his growing disappointment and misanthropy through his later writings.   
Most humans will seek external validation, especially in the ethereal. Even some misguided would-be Satanists think LaVey should be a personality to worship. I believe in every society there will be rare individuals who have the Satanic element in their bones.  




 Good job giving her the attention she wanted. 














 I don't need a dog right now. I don't need a dog right now... Augh! So tempted to go out and get a frenchie! 









 Great collection! I like the big guy on the top left.  









 Dawn of War 2 at the peak of its popularity. Intense, micro heavy combat with replays that looked like cinematic battles. 









 "Because the groups vary widely in their understanding of Satanism, it is quite impossible to examine them all. My impression is that most may be sole practitioners or even small groups of less than ten, probably active solely on the Internet, while a small amount of other groups have begun to create firmer ideologies, assemble offline, construct hierarchies, and increase membership. Scholars have not extensively studied most of the above apart from Internet presence and textual analysis of available literature; hard statistical data about these groups as a lived religion is absent."  

See the paper for the numbers that back up the author's impressions. 




 What's a Satanist without a sense of humor? Glad to oblige. 




 This quote summarizes the points I'm making: "As apparent above, when Satanism moves beyond its initial time and place, it adjusts to new particulars. Diaspora Satanism now has multiple factions, a variety of selfunderstandings, and degrees of compatibility or hostility with the Church of Satan/LaVey. Schismatic groups are now reinterpreting Satanism to such an extent that scholars are forced to consider that Satanism is now an inappropriate term when discussing groups or ideologies that have moved beyond Satanism." 




 Who had a semantic/etymological argument? The only one I see is "When I speak of theistic satanism I speak directly of the people and religions who were branded as satanic since the early days of christianity." I responded with a very clear example of why that's faulty. 

Want a historgraphic study of Modern Satanism? Here you go. Sorry but a 121 Graduate Thesis is a little hard to summarize in a Reddit comment (121 pages is the summary of the research).

http://www.academia.edu/2540808/2012._Satanists_and_Scholars_A_Historiographic_Overview_and_Critique_of_Scholarship_on_Religious_Satanism_Masters_Thesis_Dept._of_Religion_Concordia_University 




 Those were based on what I've encountered, so yeah I'd say it's pretty accurate. Does that extrapolate to the general population? Probably not, I think there are whole lot more who are mentally handicap. 









 "When I speak of theistic satanism I speak directly of the people and religions who were branded as satanic since the early days of christianity."  

That's ridiculous. Protestants and Zoroastrians were branded as satanic by the Catholic Church. By your logic Protestants would be the largest Satanic group in the world!  




 "The main issue I have is people blindly ignoring the very real existence of other subsets of believers who have been considering themselves Satanist long before CoS existed."  
  
The issue here is that, by and large, most historical "Satanists" were actually heretical Christians, or were labeled as "satanic" by various Christian/Jewish/Muslim groups as a way of ostracizing and condemning political/religion enemies (see The Knights Templar).  

Were there Satanists before the existence of the CoS? Most certainly! We would consider them "Defacto Satanists". Many would not have considered themselves Satanists because the idea of Satanism did not exist then. I'd use Benjamin De Casseres or H.L Mencken as examples. In our studies we've come across a small handful of Satanists who might be considered spiritual or theistic before LaVey (a few that LaVey knew personally), but they had little to no followings. LaVey looked around, had an extensive library and international contacts, he sought out "Satanists", and was very disappointed with what turned up. He documents this in writing and names individuals he came across.  

"Not sure why people seem to think those are the only sorts of people who fall into that theistic realm."  

Because that's what you see in the real world. I've been across the United States, Canada, and Europe and 95% of the time I've ran into "theists" or "spiritual" Satanists they're goth kids or metal heads who are trying way too hard to be evil and spooky. Then 4% are literally mentally handicap. The rest are heretical Christians or Muslims, and ex. Church of Satan people who started seeing "visions" when things didn't go their way. 




 You hit on various issues I have with what you consider "theistic satanism".  
  
1. "Being exposed to much of the Satanism communities myself over my lifetime". What does that mean? Online communities? Those are a dime a dozen, mostly filled with metal heads who think worshiping "Satan" is cool and makes them look evil. No theology involved, and if so, spotty at best.  
  
2. "Many of which stem from ancient forms of paganism that predate the existence of christianity or judaism." If this "theism" predates Judeo/Christianity, then it certainly predates the Abrahamic Satan, and therefore why in the world is it referred to as satanism?   
I'll cut people at the pass here who would then say "well, if you don't believe in Satan then why does the COS call themselves Satanists?" Anton LaVey's philosophy is pragmatic, rational, and not based on any theistic spiritualism, instead based on the *Hebrew term*, along with various psychological and sociological insight, and with an open mind to the unknown. Since we do not fool ourselves into believing in any conscious Gods that created man, we have the intellectual freedom to pick and choose the myths, symbols, and metaphors that best fit our needs.  
I'll give the Temple of Set credit, they least drop and refute the term Satanism. Because they believe in the actual God of Set they refer to themselves as Setians and practitioners of the Left Hand Path.   
  
I don't go out of my way to argue against theists here. Unless a question is asked or a false claim is made. But in the off chance that I happen to find myself in such a "debate", the only thing I ask for is consistency. If you claim spirituality, theology, belief in actual Gods and choose to worship them, you are buying into the whole lot. I'm often met with typical teenage aghast ("Don't tell me what to do! I'll do what I want!") All this signals to me is that you're not interested in theism, satanism, or anything of the sort, you're just a pretentious, angry kid (or adult child) trying to piss of your superiors (parent, community, parole officer).  
  
Anyone who studies history knows the importance of etymology. Terms and definitions are important. LaVey was not kidding when he said the first 99 years are always the toughest. He was not interested in a flash in the pan Pop Culture phase. He was deadly serious about making Satanism a recognized, organized, structured religion with its own meta-culture. So it is through the Church of Satan that his goals will be realized, in the real world accomplishments of our members and non-member affiliates, through academic and political work, and through surviving the current Invisible War. 




 Could be because there have already been 4 or 5 posts about this topic here. 




 Indeed it is... 




 *Into everyones life appear individuals who just dont seem to want to go away. They surface in many forms, but have certain common denominators. They are epitomized by the guy who is 86ed from the local bar for stirring up shit, falling through the plate glass door and suing, welching on bar tabs, and carelessly almost setting the place on fire. A week after he is told his business is no longer welcome, he pops in and tries to cadge a drink from his old buddy, the bartender. Just like nothing had happened.*    



















 Looking sharp! 














 I'm not crazy about the statement that Satanic "roots can be found in the Islam, Christianity and in Judaism". Maybe if you only focus on certain symbols and metaphors, but the religion as a whole has much deeper and substantial roots in that works of Milton, Wilde, Nietzsche, Mencken, Rand, and similar writers over Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. 




 The Temple of Set believes that LaVey and the Church of Satan received divine grace from an actual God in the form of Satan (which LaVey and the COS have denied). When Aquino was denied further control of the COS and was told to buzz off with "magickal initiations" he started to have visions of Set who gave him directions to start the Temple.  

So "Sethianism" had no role in the development of Satanism. Set can be used in certain Satanic rituals but that's a reference to Egyptian mythology, nothing "Sethian" about it. The basic texts of the TOS pretty clearly state that Satanism is an abomination and they claim no relationship with the religion other than it was the first phase that early TOS members went through.  




 In an upcoming book High Priest Gilmore will expand on the Satanic   Epicurean connection. 




 [Church of Satan: Theory   Practice](http://churchofsatan.com/theory-practice.php) 









 LP has sold out! CD is still available http://southernlord.com/store/view/terrestrials-1 




 You yourself keep name dropping the Church of Satan! You keep mentioning us in interviews and marketing! Sure, you backtrack now on a Reddit thread, but when the spotlight is on it's you who goes scrambling for that identity! Are you kidding?

**Doug was not a member.** The Church of Satan is a professionally run organization with records on all communications, memberships, and affiliations. We searched the records and there is NO MENTION of a Doug Mesner anywhere! The only people who claim he was a member are you (who has a history of making shit up) and Doug, who you, yourself, are claiming is not reliable.

If I remember the communications from Ely, it was they who thought you were mentally retarded. But let's not digress. Don't talk about having balls... you were chased out of a small sweet town for being a jackass and then playing the poor victim card. Sorry, but we received reports back from Ely about how the town actually was being very generous with you, you were the one being either delusional or making mountains out of molehills for the express purpose of cashing in on it. Either way it failed.  

You have a long history of ignoring e-mails, letters, communications of various sorts, including those pertaining to copyrights. Did you forget that you sold the rights to the LaVey and Peter MIR pieces? Or how about when you sold RFS and were supposed to hand over merchandise that needed fulfilling? You were more than happy to take people's money and then *forget*.  




 You talk of a "cult of personality" but it's you who puts so much importance on your one meeting with LaVey and how LaVey was so much more this or that. Of course you'll backtrack on this thread, but it'll be a whole other story later.  




 As far as I know, no. 




 Shane, Doctor himself kicked out many people from the Church of Satan. People he met on more than just a single occasion, people he granted titles to. Meeting him once does not give you a free pass to shit on others without repercussions. You **do not** decide who remains in the Church of Satan or not,  High Priest Gilmore and High Priestess Nadramia make those calls.   

Again, let's make this clear. This is **not about disagreements**. This is about going in public, on a live stream, spewing repugnant rants against multiple people. Do you think everyone just forgot about that? Water under the bridge? If Doctor heard another COS member say anything about him close to what you said about the current High Priest he'd do far worse than kick them out. You seem to live in a world where you think there are no consequences to your actions.  




 **Let this be very clear.**

As of your public outburst mid-2007 (CORRECTED), you were no longer a member of the Church of Satan. If that wasn't clear to you then, make it clear now.  

The Church of Satan has reviewed all records and can find **no record** of Doug Mesner ever being a member of the Church of Satan. If he told you this he either applied under a different name which we cannot verify or he lied to you.  

Also, you do not have the rights to Might is Right. You sold it off, along with Radio Free Satan, in 2007. I am the current technical director of Radio Free Satan and a Reverend in the Church of Satan.  




 "Disagreements"? No one is expected to "worship" a hierarchy, we certainly have members who disagree with each other on various things, but we will not tolerate public preschool name calling. I listened to your public, live rant on Radio Free Satan, on which you said some incredibly rude things about a number of Church of Satan members, including High Priest Gilmore.  Do you seriously think **any** organization of any kind would keep you around after a public outburst like that? Think about *that* for a second.   
Like Doctor put it, you took a shit on the floor and kicked yourself out.

Having a long-standing valvular problem which is associated with rheumatic heart disease, Anton LaVey had a kind of massive cardiac arrhythmia after several events of internal bleeding had been treated in hospital during late summer of 1997. He died on October the 29th, in St. Marys Hospital, a Catholic hospital associated with the University of San Francisco. He was brought to St. Marys because it was the closest hospital to his residence; he had never been treated there before. Although there has been some confusion with his funeral records (some listed Halloween as his death date), rumors that his death had been caused deliberately by a Christian nurse are grossly false. He was given a Satanic funeral, attended only by his closest relatives and was cremated afterwards.  




 His last wife, Blanche Barton, who is still involved in LaVey's Church of Satan, just recently did a presentation in regards to Satanism and its overlap with Secular Humanism at meeting for the Humanist Association of San Diego.

Here's one in which he addresses sexual assault in the US military:

 VICE has an issue with anyone who doesn't let themselves be a tool. I know one ex-VICE writer who left due to such issues, and there appears to be only one or two writers left there that I have any respect for. Their work quickly gets buried underneath the dozen stories about being Gay or Trans in Russia (yes, it sucks, we get it) or hanging out with Snoop Dogg and Pitbull. 




 All of the above? It depends on the context in which it's presented, but all those suggestions sound valid. It's often used in communications as a farewell salute between respecting parties. Since Satan represents the Self, it would be akin to saluting the potential within each person. I would not use that greeting towards a person who did not acknowledge or accept the Satanic philosophy as the metaphor and appreciation would be completely lost. Have taste and class. 




 What in the world was that? No where in that interview did this Eric Freeman character say he was part of the ONA, just loosely referenced the Ceremony of Nine Angles, which is actually based on Lovecraft's mythos. Seems like the editors at Vice assumed this had to the with the ONA. Even the more rudimentary research into the ONA would show that they completely disavow any connection or history with the Church of Satan and the work of Anton LaVey. I believe they reference anything by LaVey as "watered down garbage".  Vice continues to live up to my summation of their "journalism": Fox News for hipsters. 




 As a student of Heidegger I've been recommended Sloterdijk's Sphere trilogy, just never got around to it. I can agree with his Satan-centric cosmology, and his view of technology as magic and metaphysics. Unfortunately there may be some important nuances lost in translation from the German, which causes much debate in Heidegger as well. Thanks for the link. 




 Here's an article by COS member Vexen Crabtree with details on the Four Crown Princes  
http://www.dpjs.co.uk/crownprinces.html 














 No hookers, but I know of a few financially successful Satanists who played professional poker and another who ran a well known adult film studio out of Vegas. 




 Oh, I forgot about that esoteric knowledge. Those deep Mysteries unknown to the sheep but revealed to the true kvlt after some fat lines of ketamine. 




 The names themselves and their various associations (cardinal points, elements, etc.) come from Judeo-Christian myths, LaVey elaborated on them with poetic fashion. 




 And this is exactly why [Peter Gilmore's article is titled the way it is](http://www.churchofsatan.com/lets-you-and-him-fight.php).

http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9d0bwjfH81ropthqo1_500.jpg 




 Do we want to go down this road again? Who is "they" who serve to keep a "religion" pure? What is the "religion"? Do you mean heretical Christians? And don't give me that "esoteric" nonsense, it's a lame cop-out for "I have no idea" or "stuff I read online".  














 Because Satanism is a celebration of life, being your own personal god, and epicurean living. *Most* traditional Black Metal is obsessed with death, joylessness, and devil worship. There are, of course, exceptions. And something doesn't always need to be Satanic for a Satanist to enjoy it for their own purposes. 




 First of all, the Sigil of Baphomet is the symbol Anton LaVey established for the organized philosophy and religion of Satanism and the Church of Satan. So if you're talking about the Sigil of Baphomet you're talk about Satanism as defined by LaVey, not any form of "theistic" devil worship. Here is an article detailing the history of the Sigil of Baphomet, how it became incorporated in Satanism, and why.  

http://churchofsatan.com/history-sigil-of-baphomet.php  

As for the Four Crown Princes, this is entirely symbolic and metaphoric. It would be up to you to decide how you choose to negotiate them with the idea of Baphomet. 

How a devil worshiper who actually believes in the existence of these "forces" handles them, I have no idea. Especially considering how these terms existed in different, anthropologically incompatible mythologies. But that's a whole other *thing*. 




 I figured. That said, I do have a considerably large BM record collection and enjoy the music under certain conditions (Emperor   Thorns being some of my favorite bands). 















































































 [The Spanish translation of Peter H. Gilmore's S. Scriptures is now available as a hardback and slipcase.](http://shop.underworldamusements.net/category/satan)  


I've made this a text post instead of a link post so that I can follow-up with some disclosure and starting points for rational discussion, as opposed to just spamming a new book.  


*Disclosure: I've been an active member of the Church of Satan for 7 years and currently hold the title of Warlock within the organization. All this means is that the administration has taken note of real world accomplishments and applications of the Satanic philosophy. For about 10 years I've worked with a number of Satanists, independents and within the Church of Satan, on various projects ranging from organizing concerts, web development, proof reading and editing, and as a technical consultant. I put this out there due to the fact that I've seen posts that use sources like "my sister's ex-boyfriend's cousin who was once a Satanist" or decades old ex-members with bitter axes to grind.*  


That said, I cannot speak **for** the COS and its members as an entirety. But I am authorized to speak **to** the organization's functions and fundamental philosophies.


I've been lurking on this subreddit for about year and noticed Satanism/LaVey brought up several times, as recently as a few weeks ago. While many do understand that Satanism (notice I'm not using any prefixed qualifications) is based on an atheist principle, there still seem be a number of people who do not (or cannot) grasp that idea.  


Here are some experts from Gilmore's essay, What, The Devil?, which is [available online](http://www.churchofsatan.com/Pages/WhatTheDevil.html).  


"From a 1986 interview with Walter Harrington of The Washington Post:  


Satan is a symbol, nothing more, LaVey says. Satan signifies our love of the worldly and our rejection of the pallid, ineffectual image of Christ on the cross.  


Accepting the axiomatic premise that no gods exist as independent supernatural entities means that Satanists are de facto atheists. We know that the objective universe is indifferent to us. Since our philosophy is self-centered, each Satanist sees himself as the most important person in his life. Each individual thus generates his own hierarchy of values and judges everything based on his own standards. Therefore, we Satanists appoint ourselves as the Gods in our subjective universes."  


Here is Peter Gilmore discussing the issue on Point of Inquiry  
http://www.pointofinquiry.org/peter_h_gilmore_science_and_satanism/  


The other thing I see mentioned over and over is "it's just hedonism". No, Hedonism is ultimately compulsive. Peter Gilmore prefers to use the term Epicureanism.  


From the essay [Rebels Without Cause](http://www.churchofsatan.com/Pages/Rebels.html):  


"Satanists always remain in control of their exploration of pleasure. IndulgenceNOT compulsion is our founders dictum that moves us out of hedonism, which by definition is unbridled and thus compelled. Epicureanismthe balanced seeking of physical and mental self-satisfactionembraces a wider range of gratification. It is refined, selective, and embodies our concept of Indulgence. We are gourmets in the banquet of existence. Hedonism is limited to base carnal pursuits. Epicureans arent prudes, nor are we slaves to any of our desires; rather these are motivators toward seeking all manner of fulfilling experiences. The hedonist blindly sates his lusts for sex, sustenance, and somaconsequences be damned! That is a self-destructive course inappropriate for Satanists."  


While LaVey's work has been seminal to the Satanic philosophy, Peter Gilmore has been expounding on it for years, in terms and on topics that are applicable today. The Satanic Scriptures includes the essays linked above and others that have only been available those in the COS. Topics include same-sex marriage, the importance of a secular society, a clear explanation of Satanic magic, classical music, toy collections, politics, pragmatic eugenics, Godzilla, and more.  


If anyone has rational questions or needs clarifications please post them below. Do make an attempt to scroll through the comments and see if your question has been asked and answered.

 Your birthday! 




 I'm polite, and they usually are too. If they are rude I do not let them into my environment. 




 I know Satanist who work with animal rights groups, child protective services, and who do various fundraising events for their favorite causes. They can decide if being open as a Satanist would serve their goals and do the best for their selected cause. Here's one Satanic tattoo artist who holds regular fundraising events to fight animal cruelty. http://blog.artonyou.com/inkathon-2013-fundraiser-is-for-the-humane-society-of-utah-complete-details/ 




 Do fans of Darth Vader believe he existed in the real world? Can you be a fan of Star Wars and accept that it was a made up story? Man will always have religions, whether they are spiritual or material (most soccer fans I know are way more religious than Christians). We accept that religions are made-up, but they serve sociological, psychological and cultural roles. Satanism as an above ground, open religion is a relatively new phenomenon, and it won't be the last religion to disregard spirituality. 




 Since my religion  just mandates that I live my life naturally, I would say it has no "impact", it just is. In public I'm polite, in private I expect respect and will not tolerate rude behavior. The music and art I enjoy and collect tends to have a darker aspect to it, but also a sense of fun and adventure. Most misconceptions don't impact me in anyway because I do not openly declare myself as a Satanist. If I were to openly declare myself as a Satanist it may impact my career, so I choose not to do that. I want a comfortable, productive life, and I have a healthy enough ego to work around that. 




 I identified myself as a Satanist when I was about 15 years old. I was raised in a non-practicing Catholic family, but my father is an atheist. When the issue came up they were worried that I was getting involved in something dangerous, like any parents would. But I got good grades at school, graduated from college, moved out immediately, started a successful career, and take care of my own needs and help them in return. Nothing drove me to become a Satanist, I just accepted the identity naturally. I don't have any favorite leader, but I most closely align with the Libertarian Party.  




 Aleister Crowley has more to do with magical Christianity and Buddahism than Satanism, so I don't get that reference. If you don't like Satanism and don't want to be a Satanist and continue to believe in Christianity and salvation, that's fine by me! I'm not trying to trick you into believing anything. 




 No, see the work of Jung to see how you can have symbols without spirituality.  




 I don't carry it around, I had to dig it up for offering proof for this AMA. 




 Every Satanist I know carries on just fine among Christians. Otherwise you're just being an asshole. 




 There's a difference between yearning for acceptance and dispelling misconceptions.  




 There are no considerations to change the name or symbols used. This is who we are and what we represent. We do not expect our philosophy to be the majority. We respect other people's freedom to choose their religion, we only advocate keeping it out of the government. 




 We need some olfaction technology hooked up the the Occultus Rift and you're almost there! 




 I could use a good Hukilau party right now, actually! 




 In the late 90's I worked with a number of Black/Death metal bands in the NYC area, organizing and promoting shows, reviewing albums, etc. Satan and the Devil is low hanging fruit, easy material to piss people off and get attention. Which is fine, but they rarely go beyond that and actually accomplish anything with that. King Diamond actually does a great job of creating a whole performance and mythology out of his use of Satanism, as well as GHOST BC. I wish more bands would do the same.   

I would also check out the work of ULVER to see how a band can evolve and grow out. 




 Because we did the wedding on Walpurgis Night and there's a moment in Faust that describes overcoming your fears and superstitions. Have some imagination, come on! 




 I have an annual pass to Disneyland I go at least once a month! 




 I personally do not believe in magic beyond psychological mediation. 




 There are plenty of ways to destroy a person, especially their egos, that don't involve physical violence. Don't be a moron and do yourself more harm than it's worth. 




 Atheism means you don't believe in god. That's it. Can you have paranormal experiences without god? That's an important question and there are some Satanists who are interested in this. But this is not required. That IF is a big IF. There are plenty of Satanists who have no interest in magic. 




 That's absolutely correct, there's an overlap, but there are distinct differences. I agree with Ayn Rand's championing of the individual and with her bombastic spirit, but I disagree that all all humans are rational, or that there is no place for altruism. Here's an article that goes into this in much more detail http://churchofsatan.com/satanism-and-objectivism.php 




 Hierarchies are used for administrative and communicative purposes. If someone is a Warlock, Priest, or Magister, and Satanism is something you're interested in, then it communicates a level of understanding and application of the philosophy. Make sense? 




 I considered myself a Satanist since I was teenager, but I didn't join the COS until much later. I was organizing a concert that had many Satanists in attendance. I introduced myself to High Priest Gilmore who was at the bar and we had a talk about music, art, and comic books. This confirmed my belief that these are the kind of people I want to work with and I joined. Since then I've met a number of other Satanists, some of which I collaborated with, others I respect but don't have much in common with.  




 There certainly is a satirical nature to it, sure. I don't believe I'm better than everyone else, there are plenty of people I respect and go to for advice or assistance if needed. I strive to be the best ME I can be, and at times that means working with others who share my goals.  




 http://churchofsatan.com/nine-satanic-statements.php  

In essence, life your life to the fullest, spend it with those who appreciate you and don't waste your limited time on others. Don't be an asshole in public, and don't invite people into your life who would harm you. Use symbols and mythologies to drive your creativity and imagination. Don't take your resources for granted, use the tools available to you to build a better environment for yourself and your loves ones.  




 Satanic Priests don't hold any actual functions, it's an honorary title that says you have the respect and authority from the Church of Satan to represent the religion in public *if you choose to do so*. It's more of an acknowledgement from people you agree with and respect. 




 Upvote and I'll get to them.  




 Thus is the nature of a democracy. 




 I've never had a home with a basement, and I just paid off her mortgage, so I think she's alright with whatever I do. I prefer pop surreal art and Polynesian decor. 




 A priest is an honorary title, it does not have any responsibilities associated with it. It just means I have been recognized and authorized by the Church of Satan to represent Satanism *if I choose to do so*. 




 I can't comment on the Temple of Set as I'm not familiar with their religion other than their history with the Church of Satan. Believe in the power of magic beyond psychology is up to each member to decide, the Church of Satan does not push this on the membership. I know many high ranking members of the Church of Satan who do not practice ritual magic at all. There's no secret, no grand reveal.  




 Big fan of Ghost and wish more metal bands had a sense of humor about Satan! 




 Lacking a limb could be a powerful aesthetic! Have you seen Captain Hook? It means using your appearance as means of influencing the world around you. Don't be a drab, boring person, unless being a drab boring person serves your needs in a given situation. 




 Symbolic, it drives the imagination. Why do sports teams have mascots and logos? 




 Here I am, did you have something? 




 There are no "churches", it's a symbolic term. Several Satanists have gatherings at their homes, but this looks like any regular party with close friends. There have not been any threats against me in real life. 




 I've met him on several occasions but we're not in touch. 




 I lack the full goatee, but maybe the devil has good taste? I don't always keep the mustache though. https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash2/t1/377055_328634853814752_98944796_n.jpg 




 It went well! How about you? 




 Glad to have amused you! 




 Who worships Satan? Not I. 




 I do not believe in a soul that exists outside the body, but I think much of what's call "a soul" can be the mind. 




 I have never owned a fedora! I prefer well trimmed hair or a cap if I'm in a rush! 




 Dirt Devil, of course! 




 I haven't. I'm not a fan of Maher, actually. I think he's incredibly obnoxious, but that's just me. 




 Life, ambition, fun. 




 Being a priest is just an honorary title, not a job. I'm a consultant in the wine and spirits industry and spend a lot of time sitting in an airplane, gate or traveling, so here I am. 




 You keep in touch with the Church of Satan and let them know what you've been up to in the real world. 




 Being myself always worked for me. 




 I have not, and I don't think it's important to have done so. I first contacted the COS when I was in college. I was organizing a concert who's headliner was a member of the Church of Satan and many other members were in attendance. That's when I first met High Priest Gilmore. From there we've become close friends. 




 Satanism was certain influenced by Ayn Rand, mostly for the championing of the individual and iconoclasm. Here's an article on how Satanism relates to and differs from Objectivism. http://churchofsatan.com/satanism-and-objectivism.php 




 The last "mass" that was done featured only ambient music, but I like some metal here and there! 




 Atheism as one of the core principles of Satanism. 




 Time will tell. Christianity as a religion may go away, but I'm sure other forms of herd mentality will continue in one form or another. 




 In that I believe that evil is anything I don't like, then yes.  




 They're probably more in line with their natural instincts than Christians but often find other ways to make themselves feel guilty. I have several friends who are involved in Asatru and I respect our differences.  




 They are despicable. 




 Do you believe him? Did he report this to the police? I doubt it. As for a Satanic Mass, see for yourself: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1zsIk6WcNM  




 Ulver   
http://ulver.bandcamp.com/album/messe-i-x-vi-x

I listen to mostly ambient and experimental music, much of which if featured on my Chaos Sedated podcast: http://www.radiofreesatan.com/category/chaossedated/ 




 There's a lot one can learn from a MILF. 




 We had on a cliff overlooking the sunset on Walpurgisnacht. I modified the Satanic Wedding ritual that can be found in the Satanic Scriptures to make our families comfortable (no mentions of Satan, etc.), but the basic idea was there. We are two individuals joined by our love for each other, together we will accomplish our goals and share this wonderful existence. I included an excerpt from Goethe's Faust. 




 Working on it. 




 The only public rituals performed by the Church of Satan are for performance only, they are meant to stimulate the attendees. There's nothing creepy about it, at least not in my opinion. 




 After Columbine I was brought into the school office because there were rumors that I was a Satanists. They brought my parents in and threatened to suspend me. My parents gave them our lawyer's business card and said if they do anything of the sort they'd be hearing from them. They don't agree with me but they've always been proud of me. I'm lucky in that regard. 




 I agree, seems pretty lame to me. 




 I haven't seen it, but I hear it's a good time! 




 Priests don't have any actual responsibilities, I was just given that title because the Church of Satan has acknowledged my real world accomplishments and they know I have a complete understanding and representation of Satanism. Whatever I do with that title is my own decision, I'm never ordered to do anything. 




 I'm rarely bored. I'm surrounded by books, movies, music, and good friends. 




 We agree on certain principles but most of them can't seem to wrap their minds around the idea that one can accept symbolism in their life without spirituality. 




 I recently went camping with about a dozen Satanists, and go to multiple Tiki themed conventions around the year. 




 I'm a technology consultant in the wine and spirits industry. 




 I actually went to one of their brainwashing centers in Los Angeles (https://scontent-b-sjc.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/t1/190195_210792065599032_7590540_n.jpg). The thing I found most disturbing is the family with five kids purchasing a stack of dvd's and books on the way out, mother writing a check. 




 If the High Priest of the Church of Satan came out and said he supports child abuse I would drop Satanism in a quick second. There are many Satanists I don't agree with on various things, from politics to art.   

There's nothing about Satanism, to me, that's anymore difficult to apply than common decency. If I'm walking out of a bar and some random asshole cracks a joke at me, well it's "difficult" to not break his jaw. But what good would that do? I'm not interested in going to jail. There are other ways to handle it, just takes a bit of imagination or a healthy ego to walk away and know it's not worth it. 




 That we believe in the Devil.  




 Because being a priest sounds fun and it's archetype that won't go away any time soon. 




 The best parts of being in the Church of Satan are the close friends I've made. 




 Ass, for sure! Search for Old Nick Magazine for some Satanic T A. 




 There is no "satanic community", Satanists have such a wide range of interests and personalities that I've often found that they do not agree on many things beyond the basic principles of the philosophy. That doesn't mean that there aren't close friendships and bonds made with small groups of people, it's just that there's no one unified "community". 




 I don't really pay attention to the religion of other people, as long as they don't try to push it on me. Most people have no idea that I'm Satanist so it doesn't come up, but if they do that means they know me well enough to see that I'm not an "evil" person. 




 The Church of Satan is not an initiatory organization, there's no ritual or anything you can do to "move up", and it's not required. If you're doing something you're proud of, you let people in the organization know, they'll promote it, give you advice and assistance if asked, and eventually people will take notice. The administration at the Church of Satan gives titles to those members they feel are successfully applying the Satanic philosophy to the real world. 




 I do not worship anything. I use my best judgement to guide my various business decisions, most of which apply the idea that I should not waste my time and energy on people and things which would harm me and my interests. 




 I have an excellent relationship with my family, friends, and professional associates. Some know my beliefs, others don't, by name at least.  




 The last "satanic ritual" I was involved in involved hula dancers, tropical drinks, and a Dean Martin cover band. 




 Sure thing! 




 Most 5 year olds are natural Satanists, they are in-line with their natural instincts, so there's not much to explain. If pressed I would say it means that life is to be cherished, find the things that interest you and make you happy and enjoy them without guilt. But be respectful of your neighbors and don't push your ideas on to others. Let them decide for themselves. 




 Certain groups claim to be a variation of Satanism but they often just copy the doctrines of the Church of Satan and add "but we believe in the Devil!" To my knowledge there is no other competing school of Satanism. I am not including groups who actually worship the devil, as that's an entirely different thing and would akin to calling Jewish groups a variation of Christianity. 




 Maintaining the philosophy created by Anton LaVey, which accepts the importance of religion and symbols but does away with spirituality. Satan is symbol of the natural instincts of man and enjoying life. 




 It's recommended to wait a while before responding to questions to let the voting system work out. I think 45 minutes is fair. 




 False. http://churchofsatan.com/faq-lavey-and-family.php 




 Right now it's Pacific Rim. Just good old fashioned fun with modern special effects. As I kid I watched King Kong vs. Godzilla so much that it ruined the VHS tape! Really looking forward to the new Godzilla film. 




 I've spent time with a number of Black/Death Metal bands in the late 90's and for the most part they're angry kids looking to piss off their parents and look cool to their friends. Unfortunately a handful of them are deranged and violent and the "evil" stuff that's feed to them by mainstream culture serves as easy justification for their actions. 




 They claim to be Satanists but they are not related to the Church of Satan. I do not agree with their approach, as I don't think ANY religion should have monuments on government grounds. 




 The The Lindbergh Baby is a folk band with Satanic themes from Vermont, recently played to a packed audience in NYC. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxDw6k0OllI

Here's a Satanic electronic musician, The BU:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhCMAqQSf44

Maybe! 




 "What fucking the". Nice. 




 I don't really like satin actually, makes me itchy. 




 Because Satanism is about life, experiences, and having fun.  




 I'm sure someone has a copy of Twilight, which is pretty damn evil to me! 




 http://churchofsatan.com/ seems to come up for me. 




 I'm assuming you mean Greater Magic. That's left up to the individual to decide. Some only see it as psychological drama, others feel they've experienced something more than that. But this is not supernatural, it would be called supernormal. Those Satanists that believe there something more to magic would believe it to be part of our natural world that we do not yet understand. Nothing divine or spiritual. It is not mandatory to believe this to be a Satanist. 




 We do not believe in a being called Satan. It's a symbol, an abstract representation of a carnal, materialistic philosophy. 




 Atheism means you do not believe in the existence of god. But we don't throw the baby out with the bath water. Religion serves various social and psychological purposes, and we acknowledge this. But that doesn't mean you need any spiritual or divine aspect to it, just enough imagination to recognize the power of symbols and abstractions. 




 The most angsty thing in my life right now is this latest episode of WTFPod. Life is pretty mellow right now. 




 No. 




 There is no spirituality involved. Many Satanists do not open call themselves out as Satanists but apply the philosophy to their careers, interests, and art. We do not advocate martyrdom of any kind. 




 I don't agree that morals should be tied to religion. See the Eleven Satanic Rules of the Earth for the closet thing to Satanic morals.   
http://churchofsatan.com/eleven-rules-of-earth.php   

In the Church of Satan I've met artists, photographers, computer technicians, stand-up comedians, graphic designers, corporate executives, doctors, law students, hackers... and on and on. Depends on your definition of "normal". They are well adjusted members of society, yes. But I wouldn't say they're "normal", there is always something exceptional about them, in one way or another. 




 We don't believe in Hell, so the upside is we enjoy this one and only life we have with those we care for. 




 I answered this in the OP. All religions are man-made, all symbols and stories used to explain our existence and the unknown. Religion and abstractions are important to the human mind and we choose Satan as the symbol that most accurately represents our values and worldview. 




 That would imply that Jesus of Nazareth was real in first place, which is questionable. But a crossbow seems to work well for Daryl Dixon, so I'll go with that. 




 No, otherwise I wouldn't identify myself as a Satanist. And that's OK. Life is too short to try to be something you're not. 




 Over the past several weeks Satanism, directly and indirectly, has caught the attention of the media. Lunatics are blaming the Devil for their deranged acts of violence, rumors of "Satanic" cults are spreading among the tabloids and fans of True Detective are searching for the Yellow Sign in satanic rituals. Peter H. Gilmore, the current High Priest of the Church of Satan, has been [a guest on CNN](http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2014/02/17/satanist-church-accused-craigslist-killer-not-one-of-us/), [interviewed by the CBC](http://www.cbc.ca/day6/popupaudio.html?clipIds=2438899671) and numerous other outlets (published and unpublished) in an effort to defuse a revival of the Satanic Panic from 80's and 90's. It's a shame that for many people the only exposure to Satanism is in reaction to such grim, pointless insanity; when by and large the Satanists I know are some the most life-loving individuals I've ever encountered. 

Due to the recent media exposure I'm not surprised to see several threads hitting the front page of Reddit mentioning Satanism, attempted AMA's from questionable sources, and a genuine interest in what Satanism and the Church of Satan is actually about. Obviously one can go to the Church of Satan's website and [check out the basic texts](http://churchofsatan.com/theory-practice.php) and [FAQ](http://churchofsatan.com/frequently-asked-questions.php), but we recognize that humans are social creatures and a certain level of interaction can help drive points home.  

That said, my name is Raul A. and I'm an officially ordained Priest in the Church of Satan, and have been an active Satanist for over 10 years. In my time with the Church of Satan, and well before that, I've interacted with Satanists with a wide range of interests, personalities, and backgrounds. I've organized concerts with Satanic folk bands to experimental electronic musicians. I am the technical director of [Radio Free Satan](http://www.radiofreesatan.com/). My wedding was officiated by a Satanic Priest, I enjoyed Tiki drinks and 50's music with High Priestess Peggy Nadramia, and watched Kaiju films and talked Pacific Rim with High Priest Gilmore. I've also known many nonpublic Satanists who, for various reasons, cannot openly proclaim their worldviews.   

Why am I doing this AMA? For one, I think the Reddit community is interested in the topic and has been mostly given a poor representation of what Satanism is about, in theory and practice. I've seen some fairly interesting questions go without responses, and mostly a lot of talk from people who "read Crowley in high school" (FYI, Crowley never identified himself as a Satanist, and has very little to with Satanism) or "knew a guy once". Responses are often such a bore and miss the point entirely.  

So here's your chance, ask me anything! And, like any decent Satanist, let's make this fun! Let's try things other than the usual "Why call it Satanism if you don't believe in Satan" (*), let's talk about life, experiences, and the pleasures of the material world! Let the games begin!

* The "Satan" in "Satanism" refers to the Hebrew word for "the adversary", and that is the context in which we use it. We understand that the human animal has an innate need for religion, symbolism, and dogma so we Satanists willfully choose the one we most identify with.

Edit: I have a business call to attend to for an hour or so, I'll be back shortly!

Edit: Seems that many of my responses have been downvoted to Hell (ba dum). Here's a handy Q A table http://www.reddit.com/r/tabled/comments/1zgfeg/table_i_am_a_priest_in_the_church_of_satan/  

Edit: Time to roll up the tent. Overall I had a fairly good time, answered a few good questions, made some new friends, and ran into some old ones. If you haven't seen my responses, especially in the first few hours of this AMA, it's because my comments were immediately being downvoted and hidden from the default views([I didn't realize Reddit were such big fans of the Westboro Baptist Church](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg23j/i_am_a_priest_in_the_church_of_satan_nevermind/cfte5pu)). See the table above or my comment history to see my responses, [which apparently is more than most celebrity AMA's combined](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg23j/i_am_a_priest_in_the_church_of_satan_nevermind/?sort=confidence#cftg9u9). Special thanks to the moderators who've attempted to inject some rationality and to /u/Milagre for the help with the Q A Table. 




 Many great points have been made. High Priest Gilmore's interview response answers the death penalty question clearly. As for stratification, there are Church of Satan members actively advocating for political and economic reforms that would reduce government interference. See this piece from Blanche Barton:   

"Number one is stratification and is emphasized by our founding High Priest as, the point on which the other four goals ultimately rest. It advocates allowing people to sink or swim according to their own talents and abilities, instead of being protected from the consequences of their own incompetence. If a person is ethical, productive, sensitive and knows how to conduct himself among human beings, fine; if hes a destructive, amoral parasite, he should be dealt with quickly and cruelly. We havent achieved this yet. Because of the continuing cult of victimization, many incompetent, malefic beings are contentedly sucking enormous resources from our munificent government, sending us all into obscene debt, threatening the financial and social stability of our nation. As we keep working to enlighten, the compulsion to care for the PC appointed undeserving victims will dissipate like a cloud of unreason, leeches will be recognized for what they are and eradicated."

 Thank you for pointing that out. It's been fixed. 




 Going deep into Satanic epistemology and metaphysics is something I'm personally interested in but would be out of the scope of this thread. 




 Belief in Greater Magic beyond self-medication and psychodrama is up to each individual. Some members of the Church of Satan, including Magister Nemo, are interested in the research done to explain their own experiences. There are also many other members, including Magisters, who have little to no interest in rituals beyond emotional release. The Church of Satan does not have a hardline stance on the matter, because like most researchers and scientists, we accept "we don't know" as an answer. Did LaVey express great interest and belief in the power of magic? Yes, but he did not impose this belief on others. *If* one was interested in magic, he laid down the groundwork and system for practical use.      

"We emphasize that the philosophy of the Church of Satan does not require that our members believe that ritual is more than an emotional experience, nor is there a mandate even to ritualize at all. We simply offer it as a tool for experimentation. Some folks have found results that they feel are beyond coincidence or statistical parameters. Others simply enjoy the release of emotions otherwise hindering their pursuit of personal happiness."

 A healthy ego can easily respect, acknowledge, and learn from others. Otherwise you're an uneducated, pretentious asshole. 




 The Enochian Keys were included because they were *forbidden* in the occult community and this amused LaVey. He makes it very clear that Enochian is included for emotional stimulation. That's it. No occult or supernatural reason for it. He even recommends skipping Enochian if it doesn't work for you and instead reciting your favorite poetry. We call upon the demonic archetypes for emotional and aesthetic stimulation, and at the highest levels the projection of our own egos.  




 How were you drawn to Satanism if you haven't even read the most basic, simple texts? You can read through the Satanic Bible in about 2 hours, and if you're really that short in time you can go to the Church of Satan website and read the summarized texts there.   

http://churchofsatan.com/theory-practice.php


1. Individualism does not equal being in complete isolation. Individualism emphasizes (keyword here) the individual over the group, thus putting ones own self-interests first. This does **not** mean you completely disregard society or the interests of other people.   

If being in a group increases your stimulation and thus increases the chances of your magical working succeeding, then it is in your individual interest to work with other like minded individuals. The other people involved in your ritual should share your goals, and if they are people who care about you then it is in their interest to help you succeed and be happy, giving them happiness and satisfaction in return. If you read the Satanic Bible you'll see that private rituals are the preferable method of ritualizing. Group rituals should *only* be done with close, trusted associates, not random people who just want to hang out and play along.   
  
2. First of all, in Satanism all magic is black magic. The distinction between black and white magic comes from guilt-ridden occultists who think any magic which benefits you is black magic. Since we believe that all magic benefits you in some way, directly or indirectly, the distinction is merely pretentious. Second of all, practicing greater magic does not mean you believe in external deities, demons, angels, etc. See this entry in the FAQ:   
http://churchofsatan.com/faq-ritual-and-ceremony.php   
"However, some Satanists also consider the possibility that, through the raising of emotions focused towards a specific achievable goal in ritual, ideas/concepts/images might be transmitted to the minds of other people at a distance, thus perhaps influencing them to make future decisions favorable to the outcome of the situation desired by the magician (transmitter). It then seems to us plausible that there would be a means that is part of nature through which this works. It is not attained through the intervention of supernatural beings, as we do not believe such things exist. The desired goal, what we call an Is-To-Be, would vary based on peoples' ability to transmit as well as receive such images as well as the likelihood of the situation towards which the magician is working."   

We *never* worship or acknowledge higher powers.  




 I was of the idea that if I wanted metal I would listen to actual extreme metal, not an Electronic Rock band. I don't necessarily agree with that nowadays, but I still don't really care for Ministry for various reasons. 




 All the references to Cold Meat Industry in the various interviews in [DESCENT magazine](http://www.ideologic.org/news/view/3241). I was into Black/Death Metal and got interested in what other forms of extreme music was out there. I started picking up releases from Deutsch Nepal, In Slaughter Natives, and Brighter Death Now. When I would tell metalheads that I was getting into Industrial they would refer me to Ministry or Skinny Puppy, so I looked in them as well. I was incredibly disappointed. I would later grow to appreciate SP but never got into the former.

 People have short memories...

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Remembers   

"Despite the lack of evidence and inconsistencies surrounding the allegations made in Michelle Remembers, there are still people who believe that Smiths claims of abuse are the literal truth and that there is a vast, yet secretive worldwide conspiracy of inter-generational satanic worshipers abusing and murdering children and adults.[6]
The book's contents have been unsubstantiated by any evidence beyond Smith's testimony. Despite this, the book inspired copy-cat accusations throughout the world,[6][20][21] against in many cases members of the Church of Satan, non-satanic occultists, and others with no connection to the occult."
