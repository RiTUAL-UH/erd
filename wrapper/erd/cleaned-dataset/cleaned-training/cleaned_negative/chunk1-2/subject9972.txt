 I don't know much about it, it's a 2D game, something like mario, you can collect points, kill small minions and stuff. 

It's older game, so I can't remember the details.  




 Once again, thank you man so much, you made my day! :) 




 Do you think it's overhyped or it actually lived up to it's expectation. 

If you wanna check, I also made a video about it, and what I actually think about the game so far. 

Cheers!

 Is it just me, or particles are blury and not sharpened up? I have everything on high excluding triple buffering with 1920x1080 resolution and it's still 'blurry'. 

Is this due to game being made on source engine or me not being able to max it all out ( by maxing I mean triple buffering etc. ) ?

 I know it's luck based, but I saw so many people get such a good cards ( even myself ) when finishing arena with bad scores. 

What do you think about it?

 So, I just wanted to see other people opinions on E-books and do you use it often as way for reading, or do you avoid it unless you are unable to find it in physical copy. 

I find it hard reading books online, via computer/tablet or whatever device you are using. I  don't get the same feeling and it seems that I can't get into book enough for me to stay long. As for staying long, I also find it really difficult for me to read 20-50 or more pages on device rather than taking a book and chilling outside/sitting comfortable on your bed etc. 

So, how do you approach it, I know that physical copy of book can't really compare with e-book for many reasons, but what do you think about this overall? Are you comfortable to read a book on certain device as much as regular book? 

 




 So, I'm not a frequent 'book-reader' or however you want to call it, or should I say, I "wasn't", but nowdays, I'm more into books than anything else, and even tho I didn't read books what really interests me are mystery books. 

I just wanted to ask, since there are many suggestions for ones that love mystery ( like myself ) to go and read Harry Hole series, so I'm simply asking what do you guys think about it overall, what's the best book from that serial, is it smart to start from beginning ( even tho I will 100% skip first 2 books ( Bat and another one, can't remember now).

Sorry if this breaks somekind of rules, if it does, please notify me, I'll delete the thread, just wanted to see other people experience of this novel since there are some mixed feelings about it overall that I encountered. 

Thanks, and cheers! 




 Hey guys, I'm soon off on my vaication and I'm looking for good books. I recently started reading Da Vinci Code and I'm really into it ( I know I'm little too late for it, but better now than never :p ), so I'm looking for books that are similiar to this one, not in religious style, but books that are action packed, and that aren't full of description and stuff like that.
I didn't read a lot of books, and I'm starting to do it from this year ( 'new year resolution'), but I read few good ones, like Alchemist, Return and stuff like that, so I'm really newbie in this and looking for recommendation on good books.
Currently, I'm looking into Parfume book and Here to Stay: A Harrigan Family Novel from Catherine Anderson, so what do you guys think about these books, do you recommend them or whatso ever?
Thanks :)
TL;DR - to sum up, I LOVE MYSTERY, murders and investigations and stuff like that :p
EDIT: What do you guys think about book from Jo Nesbo, "Police: A Harry Hole Novel" ? 




 This is my deck, 2 images since it continues to bottom;

I have 0 legendaries, and I'm unable to craft any of them for now. Any suggestions on what I did wrong and how to improve? Thanks :)

PS: ( not that I'm implying that you need legendary to climb up, but lack of few of them is why I maybe inserted other 'not so needed' cards )

 So guys, don't know if there was thread for multiplayer, if not, this is great opportunity to talk about what you guys think overall, did it improve in any ways, or did it stay in the shadows of great singleplayer that AC series offer? What do you think? 

Also, if you are up to, check my thoughts of multiplayer overall; 


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KHXy2b00DY 









 So guys, it's been 'a while' since the game originally came out on PC, and as most of you know, it wasn't perfect in terms of optimization. Although some got it to work perfectly, others experienced stutters, frame drops, screen tearing and many problems with their gaming rig. So I figure most of you are already digged into the game a lot ( unless you're one of the unluckies to have problems with optimization ), but my question is, what do you think about it overall? Was it better than AC3? Was it worse? What are yours experiences? 

Also, I made a video and talked little about it, so if you feel like it, check it out. Also there's a potentional fix ( but I figure most of you know for it by now ( using d3overrider ), so yea. 

http://youtu.be/Pr-_03Btnk0

TL;DR: Worse than AC3? Better than AC3? In terms of optimization and what do you think about it overall? 

Cheers.

 Hello guys. My printer recently got out of ink, so I handed it over so they can refill my catridge. When I came back home to try it out, and put on the catridge, it's still red light on it, and it just blinks green for a merely second, then stands red solid. 

I have Xerox 3010/3040 printer, and I got the catridge refilled. 

I also have one question, is it normal for catridge to let down the ink, I mean, It's like there's a little hole or something and the ink is ( or powder) is slowly going out of the catridge. 

 




 As stated, I have tf2 keys to offer for AC Black Flag on uplay, or Watch Dogs. 

If there's anyone that can/want to do this, write in comments the amount of keys you want for it and I'll see what I can do about it! 




 Will trade multiple keys for either of the games!!!!  




 As stated, have tf2 keys, want Humble Origin Bundle BTA / Battlefield 3  




 Would prefer 'cheap' steam keys for above mentioned games. Name me your price and I'll see what we can do about it.  









 I'm NOT looking for games like Spelunky, or such, rather than the games like Batman, Assassin's Creed, Bioshock that has pure singleplayer campaign.

If someone has the above mentioned games ( AC3, FC3, Dishonored with DLCS and TOMB RAIDER!!), please put the price so I can know what I'm dealing with. 

Thank you! 




 Bring it on! 




 Is there anyone with similiar problem as mine, where I get disconnected from client or from the game( if I'm in the one)frequently ( every 5-10-15 minutes) and have to log back in everytime? 

What can be the problem? 









 So, is it usually like this that you get 1 quest per day? Or is there supposed to get bigger as you progress through the game regarding levels and such?  









 Hello. I have unusual Controller for PC, but untill I get my hands on XBOX 360 controller for PC i have to for now stick with this one. Is there any program that allows you to custom change your controlls to be able to play any game with that custom design.

 Hello guys. Just quick question about cables that are coming from PSU. I'm pretty newbie for these stuff, so I'm interested how to know which cable is supposed to go to harddrive, which one to DVD-ROM and such. I have 2 cables, and one is 6D, other is 8D, and the 6D was in my harddrive. What's the difference? 




 Hello guys. I recently purchased mine Sapphire HD 7850 card, and I wanted to see if anyone is experiencing same problem as me when trying to reedem the code. It says; 

"There was an error processing your submission, please check all values and try again. If the error persist please contact AMD Support at support@amd4u.com." 

 




 Hello guys. I'm not asking for any big help in particular, I just wanted if someone knows good site that you can learn about hardware stuff on it. What's the common one that's used widely, and that it has good reviews and tips. 

I already started reading on PCWORLD but I would love as many sites as possible. Thanks! :))

 So, apparently, while working on that mother quest, I end up having cops on my tail, and I can't get rid of them, wherever I go they start shooting at me because  I hacked that thing because I needed information about something. 

So, is there any possible way to interact with them so they stop shooting, or I just have to play all over again? :S 




 Thanks man once again, awesome funny game. 

All credits goes to this guy /u/bud369 




 As stated in title, while I do something, for a period of time, like watching movie, the laptop ocassionally and randomly turns black, but you can hear fans working, and there's still green light that's on too. it's like on sleep mode, but you can't wake it up or something. All I can do is turn it off, and turn it on again, but when I do that, it tends to happen again after short/long period ( long in terms of 1-2 hours, short in terms of 10 minutes ). 

It's about Toshiba laptop. Any help is appreciated, thank you!

 I would really appreciate someones generosity, if that someone could waste their time and a little money to give me Metro 2033. I'm asking only Metro, because i want to get it for my friend, as he is one of the biggest fans of games like Metro 2033, Bioshock or that. 

Anyway, thanks. 

Cheers!
 




 So, did anyone manage to handle this fps drop that appers at Boston. I played a game like 5-6 hours in a row, to sequence 6. When i came into Boston, there was a huge fps drop. Previous sequences, or places were apsolutely fine. 

I have HD5750 1GB, 8GB RAM, and X4 640 3.0 AMD Processor. 

I don't see a problem in my configuration, but the reason why i posted this, is to see, if anyone manage to solve this problem. It bothers me, because after passing 22% of game, i had to switch to Need For Speed Most Wanted, because i want to play AC3 at full experience. 

TL;DR - FPS Drop mainly in Boston, if anyone knows how to fix it, let me know! 




 I prefer batman AA, and would go all in for it. 

Cheers!

I'll give all of these things for Batman AA

I'm willing to give all of these for Batman.

 Yo guys, i just watched ocelote stream, and someone send ocelote a message, about candy panda, something me gusta and spanish shit' ( no offense ), and it was something SK ad carry, me gusta ad carry, something like that.

**How the 4pack splitting works** 

+ I will trade the 4 pack for the listed price + a collateral 
+ You activate the 4 pack and the game gets added to your library and 3 extra copies in your steam inventory 
+ You trade the extra 3 copies for your collateral back 


***Collateral will the cost to cover the price of the full 2/3/4pack***     

*If you have a good steamtrades account / blue+ sgsflair , the collateral wont be needed*    



**Price for 4pack splitting**    

(Note: I value ToD as - 3 ref)

**How to check whether you are eligible for unpacking a 4pack**

First and Foremost, You MUST NOT own the game in your library  
Second, Follow these steps

+ Go to the steam store mainpage.
+ Add any game into your cart
+ Select Purchase as a gift

 Is there active PES 2013 community or is it better to wait for 2015 to come out? Not really a huge fan of 2014. 




 So, I'm staying on a vaication for a while where I don't have acces to internet on my PC. I have internet on mobile, and I'm wondering will my steam offline mode on PC brake if I login on steam on my mobile?

 I'm new to this game and I can't seem to understand how to attack with your troops other troops that came via sea. I'm fighting during third mission "We will endure" and it's so hard to attack ( don't know how), while in the meantime, I don't even have baracks built.

 




 As stated, please don't lowball and please for the love of God don't offer me Dead Island Epidemic. 









 Is there active community on PC now and should I get Fifa 14 now, or just wait for the Fifa 15? 

Is there overall active PC community regarding FIFA ? 




 So in a few days, I'm going on a long vaication where I won't have access to internet on my PC for a while. ( 1-2 months at the most ). 

So, regardin steam and its offline mode, how does it works, does it have any limits on how long can I use it? Is it restricted in any sort? 

And what happens with achivements and playhours?

 I've never been able to access steam market since I never bought anything from steam store/market itself.
My question is, if I buy steam card now, and activate it, will I be able to use market without any kinds of restrictions considering buying/selling on market, or will I have somekind of cooldown before I'm able to do that?

Thanks and cheers.

 What's the price then in $/? 




 Title. 




 Offer below. 




 I just want to ask, if a person revokes CSGO keyes I got "as a gift" ( i payed via bank transanction, but on steam, it looks like a gift when you trade blank keys for nothing ), can I ask for a refund, or something, can I get those keyes back? 

How does it work? 




 S3 finished as GOLD IV, have around 90 champions and around 30 skins. If you are merely interested, contact me, I'll give you more informations. Account wasn't banned a single time and I'm willing to use middle-man for our trade. Already made around 20 trades on reddit.com/r/sgswap. EUW ACCOUNT!
For more information regarding which skins do I have, and overall the information on account itself, PM me or post a comment below.
Please don't offer me separate origin/steam/uplay or whatsoever accounts as I would like to keep my games on a single account.

I accept keyes, offer whatever you think would be acceptable offer,  without lowballing, please.

Cheers! 














 Offer basically anything, that's around same price, or whatever you think it would be a good deal.  









 I'm new at this stuff, hence why I'm asking. Sorry if this is forbidden. 




 Title? 

Do you usually read a book, then follow it with a movie, or vice versa? 

Is Headhunters good book, and what's the movie like for those who watched it?  




 Mostly these 2 games, for personal use only. 

Prices?

 Are there enough people to play FIFA 14 on PC, online and stuff like that? 









 I think I'm almost done with the game, and I'm packed up with potions ( full of everything ) have 300+ gold left, and I came to the point where I had to check if my difficulty didn't lower it self while I was playing. 

The game is really great, I love it so far, but I feel that it could've been more challenging. 

What do you think about it? 




 pls, I'm very confused 




 My current specs are following: 

CPU; AMD ATHLON II X4 640 @ 3.00GHz QuadCore

Memory; 8GB RAM DDR3 1333MHz "Kingston"PC10666 CL9

Harddrive; 500GB Sata

Graphic card; ATi RADEON Sapphire HD7850 1GB GDDR5

Motherboard: FOXCONN A78AX 3.0

I want to upgrade my processor ( + motherboard since this one doesn't support AM3+ ) so, what do you think I should get with this configuration with around 300$? 

I'm playing on 1920x1080.

Should I get an SSD too?

 




 What's the Length of the game with and without side-quests? 




 Is there any video to show how good this game is and why is it actually good game? 

I mean how to make someone love the game if you know what I mean.

This is my currently build, and I'm afraid to buy Dayz thinking it wouldn't perform properly due to bad optimisations. 

Should this be enough to run the game without a hitch?

And I kinda want the game so leaving for a bit until they potentionally fix the optimisation is kinda not an option, since they may up the price a little bit then and stuff like that ...
