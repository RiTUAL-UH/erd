 If you were to boil down 5 things that make an outstanding NCO, what would your five pieces of advice be? 

Also, what books do you highly recommend for someone getting ready to pick up their stripes? 




 Hey y'all, 

I'm looking for more books with academic wizards. I loved *Jonathan Strange   Mr. Norrell.* I also really loved the portion of *The Name of the Wind* where Kvothe was attending university. I'm looking for more books where wizarding is seen as an academic pursuit, full of Latin phrases, obscure references, cool robes, classes, and **books!**

Can you help me out? 









 What if a group of wealthy individuals bought a large mass of land. Seeing as it is private property, they can do what they wish right? So they establish a government, much like the US but smaller. They "rent" property out to anyone who wishes to "immigrate". They then regulate environmental practice on this land "it is their private property" and regulate guns, the market, and such (I.e. if you don't obey they kick you off their "private property". They leave a will that states every four years the people must elect a fixed number of people who become "property owners" of this land mass.

Wouldn't this be a state, but completely agreeable with ancap philosophy? 




 I'm the Army vet who posted the question about tattoos recently. I'm looking to become a Middle/High School English teacher in the South (I'm from Alabama). I had some more questions, I'm sorry if there are too many.

* Will being a male put me at a disadvantage?

* How difficult is it to secure a job after I get accreditation?

* What is Summer like for y'all?

* Are you allowed to present ideas for electives you'd like to teach?

* What are some good resources (books, articles, and websites) related to education you would recommend to a young teacher?

Thanks in advance for your help. I've found this sub super friendly.

 




 I'm pursuing a degree towards education, with the intent to be a Secondary English teacher in the public school system. Obviously I'm not a fan of the system, but kids need to be taught even in our messed up system.

My questions are thus;

* What has your experience in the public school system done for your libertarian philosophy?

* Do you ever find conflict between your career and philosophy?

* How do you deal with the world of public education as a libertarian (especially unions, standardized testing, federal interventionism etc).

* Any other thoughts, tips, or tricks about being a libertarian in the public education sector? 




 Hello, I currently have some gold bullion coins from the US mint, but I'm curious if it's possible to buy gold bullion coins from other nations? 




 Hello, I'm a Confessional Presbyterian (OPC). I'm looking for someone to have some discussion with regarding Worship, Ecclesiastical Polity, and the nature of the Sacraments. These are three things I am conflicted about, and am between my confession's view, and the view of historic Reformed Anglicanism. I'd really like to carry out the conversation via PM if that is ok. 

 




 Hello,

I'm not sure if this is the correct sub forum for my question, but here goes. I'm an Army veteran about to go back to college for English Education. I'd like to teach Middle/High School English. The thing is, I have tattoos. My arms above my elbows are half sleeves, and I have four on my lower arms. Will this pose a problem for me?
 




 To all my fellow bibliorganizationophiles out there. How do you organize your home library? I have a pretty extensive library, mostly dealing with literature, literary criticism, and theology. I'm looking for a more detailed way to keep it organized, as it is getting rather out of hand (i.e stacks of books with no shelfly home). 




 Caliban is my favorite Shakespearean character. I've always been baffled as to who he is exactly. At various points reading and watching The Tempest I've seen him as a mentally handicapped person, a cannibal like native islander (his name is an anagram of the Spanish word for *cannibal*) and various monstrous sub-human characters. 

What's your speculation about the nature of Caliban? What's your favorite way to see him portrayed?  




 I understand that each major category has a 100's place, but behind that how exactly does the system work? For example, you get a book on Elizabethan history, it would go in the 900's place, but how do you determine the rest of the Classification?

 **I was reading *The Theology of Prayer* by the great Southern Presbyterian Benjamin Palmer, when I came across this quote. Pairs wonderfully with the first question of the Shorter and Larger Catechisms I think.**

"Upon this soul is stamped the seal of the divine attributes. In his intelligence man dimly reflects the divine wisdom; in his affections, the divine benevolence ; in his conscience, the divine rectitude; in his will, the divine power. Such a being can find his true sphere only in God. All these endowments point to that august source from which they are derived, as the only goal to which they can aspire; and the comprehensive act in which they all embark is the homage of an intelligent and eternal worship."

~ Benjamin M. Palmer, The Theology of Prayer 




 Theoretically, could we ever base the US dollar on a cryptocurrency standard comparable to the gold standard? Obviously we would have to eliminate the FED and the Keynesian stuff. Obviously the cryptocurrency would have to be non government controlled. We all agree that we need a strong dollar backed by some resource (gold, silver etc). Also we agree that the market should decide said resource. What if the market chose cryptocurrency?

Is it feasible? What steps would we have to take? 




 First, forgive me for being an ignorant American here.

If the U.K. is one country, why are England, Scotland etc separate national football clubs? Why isn't there just one U.K. football club? 




 It seems that the presbytery in whose geographical bounds Leithart is currently ministering in (Evangel Presbytery) has sent a second letter to the presbytery Leithart is a member of (Pacific Northwest Presbytery) regarding his laboring outside the geographical bounds of his own presbytery. 

http://theaquilareport.com/pca-evangel-presbytery-asks-peter-leitharts-presbytery-to-deal-with-his-ministry-status/

I have a few questions.

1. If Leithart is a TE at a CREC church, why is this an issue for the PCA presbytery in whose geographical bounds he is ministering in? Restated; since he isn't working in a PCA church, how does this affect Evangel Presbytery? 

2. Why does it seem the presbyteries are more keen to address his unconformity with the Book of Church Order, while still not addressing his unconformity with the WCF (FV)? 




 Curious as to what y'all think about the concept of indentured servitude as punishment for nonviolent crimes. To clarify I don't mean *slavery*, at least not in the antebellum sense.

What I mean is, if someone violates your property rights (fraud, theft etc) then they have to work without pay for a period of time.

This could be done two ways

1. The criminal could work for whoevers property rights they violated.

2. The criminal works at a special labor camp.

Of course, it would have to be done humanely. No violations of NAP upon the "prisoners". Feed them, etc. But instead of sending them to a prison where they simply are turned into more violent criminals, we send them to work without wages for a period of time relative to their crime.

Is this a wacky idea? 




 I mean this as a friendly question, but this sub is so diverse that I was curious what the general consensus was.

Are you TR? (TR=Truly Reformed; Strictly Confessional, Old School, Strict Regulative Principle of Worship, Cessationist, Not a broad Evangelical, Hodge-ian)

 I want to join one, but can't decide which community is best.

Not beer advocate. The ratings seem soo amateur..

I'm really leaning towards Beer Citizen.

Any others? 









 Other than a good beer selection (which is a given).

In my town, there are *zero*. Everywhere only has the typical adjunct "party beers". I usually just buy my beer to drink at home. But I'm going on a road trip soon, and I'm looking to visit some good bars on the way. I want to know what qualities I should look for to determine whether a bar is worthwhile before I spend too much time/money without the best experience? 




 I've only been to two. Both weren't exceptional. The food was great, but the beers were average (still better than adjunct lagers). The concept is interesting to me though. Reminds me of old medieval taverns where the local tavern keeper brewed their own beer.

Anyways, what has your experience been? 




 "Let us therefore hold it for certain and firmly established that the soul can do without everything except the word of God, without which none at all of its wants are provided for. But, having the word, it is rich and wants for nothing, since that is the word of life, of truth, of light, of peace, of justification, of salvation, of joy, of liberty, of wisdom, of virtue, of grace, of glory, and of every good thing. It is on this account that the prophet in a whole Psalm (Psalm cxix.) and in many other places, sighs for and calls upon the word of God with so many groanings and words.

Again, there is no more cruel stroke of the wrath of God than when He sends a famine of hearing His words (Amos viii. 11), just as there is no greater favour from Him than the sending forth of His word, as it is said, "He sent His word and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions" (Psalm cvii. 20). Christ was sent for no other office than that of the word; and the order of Apostles, that of bishops, and that of the whole body of the clergy, have been called and instituted for no object but the ministry of the word."

~ Martin Luther, *Concerning Christian Liberty*

P. S. I don't know if this sub is a fan of quotations, but this one hit me while I was reading the aforementioned work. 




 What beer related bucket-list items do you want to accomplish before you die?

Mine follows:

1. Drink a pint of Guinness in a Dublin pub. (Which Dublin pub is the best?)

2. Drink *Calvinus* which is brewed only in Geneva.

3. Drink at the Wittenberg brewpub in Wittenberg Germany.

4. Visit all of the Belgian Trappist breweries. 




 I've heard Guinness is better from the tap. I like their stout (the import version). I was just curious is tap Guinness kegged with nitrous? 




 Me, I like traditional beer styles. Stouts are my favorites, and I also love the traditional ale styles. I rarely ever try cutting edge, innovative, or nontraditional styles (odd combinations/ingredients, hard liquor in beer etc) beers. They just don't interest me. Plus, with all the stouts out there to try, I have enough on my to-drink list! About as nontraditional as I typically go is something like a peanut butter milk stout.

What about you? How often do you venture into the new styles of the beer world?

Edit; sorry about the spelling mistake in the title. I cannot type well on a tablet. 




 I love watching YouTube beer reviews. I'm a big fan of *The Albino Rhino* and *Chadz* beer reviews. I'm looking for other quality reviewers. 

Who do y'all recommend? 




 I'm gonna be honest. I do the unthinkable... sometimes, I drink Budweiser. Now I usually drink craft beer. But sometimes, is there anything wrong with just drinking a cold one the same way you'd drink a coke? 

Sometimes my more snobby craft beer friends hate on my for drinking Bud or Yuengling while watching the game or barbequing. The fact is, when I'm doing those things I intend on drinking more than six beers, and drinking them easily. I'm not drinking them for complexity etc.

anyways, how do you feel about the snobbier side of craft beer? Do you avoid macro's at all times?  









 I'm just curious what the various approaches are. Do you have a regular time for family worship (devotions)? What do you do during that time?

Our family does every night. We open with a psalm or hymn, then we will read either a question from the Larger Catechism or the Heidelberg. Afterwards we will get into whatever we are studying. Sometimes we go through a book of the bible, sometimes we explore a particular topic, sometimes we use a book or other material (notably Paul Miller's material). We usually close with prayer time for various and sundry requests. Though we don't have kids yet, when we do we are considering using the New City Catechism. 









 It is very hard for me to choose, but if I had to narrow it down it would be a toss up between Thomas Watson, Thomas Brookes, and Samuel Rutherford.

1.  Watson's *Art of Divine Contentment* was phenomenal.
2. Brookes's *Precious Remedies Against Satan's Devices* has probably had more of an impact on my walk than any other book.
3. Rutherford's *Letters* taught me a lot about compassion, and still provide a continual source of comfort and pastoral encouragement when I am away from home.

What about y'all? 









 Consuming alcoholic beverages, yay or nay?

As for myself I'm all for them in moderation. I believe beer is one of God's greatest physical gifts.  




 I recently started reading Chomsky for the first time. Up to this point I've never paid much attention to him, instead favoring more Rothbardian authors. Now that I've read him, he seems...inconsistent. How can someone who supports liberty, anarchy even, support the welfare state and the UN? Am I missing something? 









 The only responses everyone is throwing out are;
1. Gun Control - obviously a bad idea. I shouldn't even have to expound on why.
2. Lock away mentally unstable folks who "seem" violent. - Another obviously idiotic and oppressive idea.

What are some common sense ways to approach this subject without violating liberty? 









 I'm looking for something quirky, with realistic characters and great relationship development. Something similar to "Tell the wolves I'm home" by Carol Rifka Brunt (which I just finished and *adored*).

 Just curious how offer y'all contact your representatives?  














 Obviously not a question for anarchists, but do you think secession is legal? If so, under what circumstances is it legal? 









 There's a lot of interesting/high quality ones out there, and I love collecting them. What's the most interesting one in your collection? 




 Hey y'all, forgive me if this is a super amateur question, but I'm studying for my tech license and thinking about putting a 2m in my car for my first radio.

My question is, what antenna do you use? Do you use the default antenna on your car? If so, how do you connect it to the radio?

 I'm 21, planning on opening a Roth IRA target date fund. I've narrowed my choices down to either Vanguard, Charles Schwab, or T. Rowe Price. I'm leaning towards Vanguard. What do y'all think? 









 Originally, we were founded on the basis of the Articles of Confederation, until some of the federalists had their say. It seems to me the AoC established a more decentralized government. Do you think we should have stayed under it? If so, how would America look today? 









 I am a buy and hold investor, how exactly does an ETF work, and what can it do for me? 














 I'm 21 years old, trying to start my long term investment vehicle. I'm seriously considering a Roth IRA because of the tax benefits. (I am sure my tax bracket is lower now than it will be when I retire). I've heard a lot lately about Indexed Life Insurance policies and Annuities. It seems they give you a floor so you won't lose money, and you can withdraw the cash benefit anytime. It seems like flashy smoke and mirrors to me. 
   My question is, what do y'all think? Which investment vehicle performs better, and is likely to leave me in a better position at retirement? 




 Stick with me and you'll go places. 




 Because young men need good role models that spend time with them. 














 It has been explored in a variety of SciFi books/series, but what way do you think it would happen? Through radio? Physical contact? 

I tend to think radiowaves are probably the most likely way they would make contact. Our radio signals are easily picked u and clearly signify intelligent life, and would be one of the first thing a scout would notice about our planet. It makes sense that they would try to contact us through this medium. What do y'all think? 




 I know I know, wacky topic. Just thought I'd throw it out there. Has anyone you've known experienced electronic voice phenomenon? Do you think it is possible for paranormal stuff to be on the radiowaves? 
























 I have a few questions about who y'all think are the best pitchers currently in the MLB?

2. Who is the most diverse pitcher in the league? (Pitcher with biggest and best developed arsenal)

3. Who is the best technician? (Pitcher with a mastery of a single pitch)

 I'm specifically interested in the fashion/lifestyle of the country side of rockabilly. I love Hank William's fringed suits, pearl snaps, and twang. Are there any websites/resources that deal with this subgenre of the lifestyle at all?  









 I'm currently out of the US, and last night was listening to my Grundig shortwave, I picked up an odd signal for someone who said "this is Oscar the engineer" like three times before the signal got too bad. Odd thing is, I've heard the same transmission before while I was in the states and thought nothing of it. Does anyone know who Osacr the Engineer is?? I know it is a longshot, but I thought I'd ask yall 




 I know several times throughout his career Tesla claimed to have recieved raidiowave transmissions from Mars. Does anyone know of a book/resource that further elaborates on the story behind this?

 I really love good biographies. And I love classical music! Have any of y'all read a great composer biography that you really enjoyed? 




 Specifically one dealing with the philosophy of work/work ethic, a history of blue collar work,  sociopolitical aspects of blue collar work, etc... Can anyone help me out? 




 There were many composers who wrote deliciously melancholy pieces, but on the whole who do you think captures this emotion best? Also, which work by your suggested composer exemplifies this emotion best?

My answer would be Chopin. His melancholy pieces are among my favorites. I think his "Prelude in e minor" or perhaps "Nocturne in C# minor" best exemplify what I mean. 









 I'm not talking how-to books, or electrical books, but history books. The only two I've read so far are 

Hello everybody! The dawn of American Radio by Anthony Rudel 
 
And

Empire of the Air: The Men Who Made Radio by Tom Lewis.

Any more suggestions? 









 I know, odd request. I'm looking for either a history/nonfiction book about early country music (1930's to 1960's) or some good biographies of early country musicians.

 As a book lover my local library is one of my favorite places. In fact, I prefer my local library to my local bookstore. I think libraries stand as bastions against the overwhelming illiteracy of our culture. What about y'all? 

1. Is your library well stocked?

2. Are the librarians helpful?

3. How frequently do you go to your local library?

4. Are you involved in any programs put on my your local library?

 I listen to the Tom Woods show regularly, and I'm looking for more libertarian or even an/cap radio shows/podcasts. Can y'all help? 












































 I know it's an odd question, but my favorite characters have always been the tinkerers/mechanics. I love the guys who play with cool scifi toys, keeping even the most junky stuff running long past its prime. Can anyone think of good novels somehow related to this theme? 



















 Hi y'all, I'm pretty new to amateur radio. I've only built a few crystal sets, and am just now getting into tube radios. I am curious about trying to build a simple homemade transmitter. What types of transmitters are the simplest for home build? 









 I'm looking for some libertarian imagery to incorporate into a tattoo. Maybe y'all could help? Specifically something I can incorporate into an old school style tat. All I've come up with so far is somehow using the Guy Fawkes mask (and I know he wasn't libertarian so don't even go there). Any ideas? Something that'll make a statement? 









 I know it's a huge selection, but fantasy is chock full of magical swords, staffs, wands, and other enchanted goodies each with their own characteristics. Often I find that the props become characters themselves. So If you had to pick a personal arsenal, what items would you have in it?  




 What's your favorite vehicle of any kind from SciFi? Or, what SciFi vehicle do you think plays such a big part in the story that it becomes a character itself?

 I found conviction in my beliefs by finding conviction in His word. I have never had any experience of God. No feelings, no eerie emotions. I do believe his word because he has, by grace, enabled me to believe it.  




 Hello, Afghanistan veteran here.

I am curious to know whether you think the war/military intervention has made Iraq better or worse, from personal experience?

1. How has the country changed since Saddam's regime fell, in your personal experience?

2. How has U.S. intervention affected you personally?

3. What are your opinions about the war and the soldiers who fought it? 




 I think they are basically the same thing as Tacoma's in the U.S

 It puts the fragility of life into perspective. Though I am only in my twenties, the attitude of bullettproof youth is all gone. Experiences like that tend to make you grow up quickly too. I think I am more mature than many of my civilian peers because I have come to realize the things most of them think are important, are not important at all. 




  "You give them credibility when you silence yourself,"

Now that is what I am talking about. 









 *To Kill A Mockingbird* taught me what true masculinity should look like, what meekness was, and how courageous it was to stand up for lost causes. It taught me that justice is not dependent on what our peers think it is. Atticus Finch is still my role model. One day, if we have a son, my wife and I have agreed to name him Atticus. 









 I was in Afghanistan at 22. Watched a friend die up close. 

I would say that whole experience has shaped and defined me in a way not much else could.

 I love MC Lars's stuff. He is a English geek who became a hip hop artist, using hip-hop to teach literature.

[Here](http://youtu.be/1ucYtOk_8Qo) is his TEDx talk entitled *The hip-hop of Shakespeare*

 There really is not a quick way to earn money. The best bet is to pick up an extra job and pay it off chunk by chunk. It may take awhile, but it is the only stable solution. 




 And the statists call our economics "magical". 









 Nobody at your unit can help you. You have to talk to your branch manager.  




 They pay the service provider to air their ads because that exposes their product to a large group of consumers.

Paying the consumers directly to watch an ad to convince them to buy the product is an incredibly roundabout and expensive way of doing it. It would cost a huge sum of money to reach the amount of people just one ad on a regular television program reaches.  




 Some of it has to do with the fact that places like Thailand have extremely unregulated sex workers. If you were looking for things that were frowned upon by developed society (age) you would obviously go somewhere where there is not a ton of regulation of that market. 




 Some denominations continued using wine, and the producers of sacramental wine were able to get exemptions.

Other denominations who were at the head of the prohibitionist movement switched to using grape juice. One of the fellows who started Welch's grape juice company was a vehement advocate for teetotaling, and tried to advocate for grape juice being used at the communion table. 

That divide still exists today. Many of the more fundamentalist Christian denominations who advocate teetotalism use grape juice instead of wine at the Table. 




 Tom Cruise or Steve Carell. Both classy and hilarious guys. 

I hate late night shows like Letterman, but anytime either of those gentlemen are guests I have to tune in. 




 Left Hand Brewing's Nitro Milk Stout. 




 There is nothing wrong with this. Joining the military is an act of voluntary association. You agree to their rules. 

I agree with ending the drug war, but if an employer includes restricting drug use in an employment contract, and you agree to that contract, you are held to that contract. 




 Awesome! Our library staff here on Fort Drum is incredible. 




 That is the point of stand up comedy. If they got up there and gave accurate, totally unexaggerated representations of the people in their lives, it would not be funny at all. So they exaggerate, make stereotypes, and *make jokes*. 




 Not a librarian, but I just wanted to say I have a tremendous amount of respect for y'all. No matter where I have lived (literally all over as a military servicemember) the local library has always welcomed me with open arms. I think data and information management is such a ncessity in a developed society. Folks do not know how important y'all are.

 **OP**

1. I am in the Army. I work in a motorpool helping maintain trucks. 

2. I bring an old green stanley lunchbox with me to work everyday. It is usually filled with a bar of lava soap, moonpies or little debbie cakes, two sandwiches (usually bologna or salami on white bread), chips or a small green thermos of soup, and a can of coca-cola. I also bring a gallon jug of sweet tea that I consume throughout the work day and whatever book I am currently reading.  I get about an hour lunch break. I scrub my hands, sit down in my office, and eat at a back desk, taking my time.

3. I usually use my lunchbreak to either listen to a podcast (either *This American Life*, *How Stuff Works*, or *Planet Money*), or reading a bit of whatever book I am currently working on. After my break I am usually energized to finish the rest of the day (which tends to be long). 




 1. What is your vocation?

2. Describe a typical workday lunch ritual for you.

3. Do you use your lunch break for anything other than quickly scarfing down substinence? 




 She paints, makes crafts, volunteers at our local USO, volunteers for the military family readiness group, and teaches classes to new Army wives. 




 A Maglite. 

A large bag of marshmallows.

A thermos of coffee.

 Because I do not go to parties. And if I did, they would not be parties with dancing. They would probably be scrabble parties. Or maybe jeapordy parties. Perhaps I would even get crazy and attend one of my book club's parties. But never *ever* a dancing party. 




 Does humanity have a good track record when it comes to reacting peacefully to people who are different than them? 




 It depends on how quickly the state were dismantled. 

The first step is to stop forcing people to pay into Social Security in the first place. 














 Samwise sounded more like Spock. 




 You listed many pros, but I think you forgot a con.

There is the possibility you would see Hillary naked one day. Think about that for a minute.

 Most religious people have absolutely no problem talking about sex.

 Firefly. 




 I am not with it at all. I don't really like pop culture, so I just kind of ignore it. 




 Not exactly. Ukraine is a totally seperate country. Ukraine was a part of the USSR, but when the USSR dissolved Ukraine won independence.

Now Crimea, which was a small state within Ukraine, has voted to leave Ukraine and annex to Russia. Ukraine is still a totally seperate nation though. 




 Yeah, I still have no clue either. It seems totally bogus to me, whatever it was. 




 Welding. If you get certified, you can bring in some serious side hustle.  




 Nothing unbelievably. All of my skills are quite believable.

 




 Are you asking for Australians to comment on their favorite American foods, or are you an Australian who wishes for Americans to comment on their favorite American foods? 




 Afghanistan has to be on the list. 

I was there. The mountains are breathtaking. They have a rich and multifaceted culture that has been hijacked by religious extremism. Their economy, liberty, human rights etc are awful. 




 Basically I am asking how important you think it is to work a vocation that is totally your dream, as opposed to learning a skill you love some parts of and dislike other parts of. 

Weigh in, how do you approach the idea of vocational fulfillment? 




 I just finished the episode, and I was floored by how sucked into this stuff people get.. Normal people leaving their jobs for a get rich scheme.. I dunno, it really surprised me. 




 What are some examples of market economies in which individuals were close to totally free markets, and those markets worked?

I am just looking for tangible examples of laissez faire working. Can y'all help? 




 There is not one value. Mature and responsible manhood is a combination of various attributes. 




 My workshop. I have a minifridge stocked with craft beer. The walls are decorated with various tin signs, beer neons, gun and ammuniton ads. My tools are laid around, but not in a disorganized way. Unfinished projects, currently a bookshelf, lie on the other half. I have a lived in recliner I picked up from a garage sale over by the minifridge.  




 Bootcamp will be the easiest part of your military career. Do not be an individual. Blend in, be quiet, do not stand out and you will be fine.

Remember, when you get to your first unit, nobody will give a shit how good you were in boot camp. So just get through it.  




 Probably a pavlovian effect created by years of advertising.

In other words, you have been programmed to react that way by years of watching someone drink coke on televison and making that sound. 

If you are unfamiliar with classical conditioning [this Wikipedia article](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning) explains it. 




 It is hard to explain. Each department has a lot of independence. They are not exactly in the same chain of command. More like several cooperating entities with their own chains of command. 




 Kind of. They have different roles. If a crime happens within the city, and is confined to the city, it is usually the local PD who takes care of it. If it is a county wide thing, a crime involving several cities, or outside of city limits, the Sheriff will usually handle it. If it js a statewide thing, or something on state land, the troopers get it. 

That being said, there is a ton of cooperation between departments. There is also conflict. Sometimes Sheriff's and Deputies overstep their bounds in city limits, and vice versa. It is a more organic relationship.  




 Sheriff's Dept. is the *county* police forcr, local PD's are the *city's* police force, and State Troopers are the *state's* police force.
 




 What if there were a travel show in which the host visited notable libraries around the world? The Vatican Library,The Library of Congress, The Admont Library etc. There could even be episodes where famous authors take the host to their favorite libraries. Along the way the host could comment on notable rare books, library histories, ways in which libraries have contributed to their local communities, and other things. 

I mean c'mon people, we have a travel show called *Booze Traveller*, but we cannot make a good travel show about books? 




 *Das Kapital* is on my reading list, I have been a little intimidated by it though, it is quite the beast. 




 Well they would if they were communists. But they are not. 


China is communist in the same way the U.S. is capitalist, i.e. not at all. Do you believe the U.S. is an actual capitalist country? No. We are a mixed economy. We are a hybrid of semi-free markets and government intervention. China, N. Korea etc are the same way. They started out totally communist. Now they are hybrid states, centralized totalitarian authority states mixed with some form of limited market economy. 




 This makes literally zero sense. Marx and Engels's *Communist Manifesto* is the founding document of Communism. 




 Dry ice. Nitrogen cooling. Both would cool your items very quickly. 




 Yes I am aware. But obviously other nations have nuclear weapons. If we were a stateless society, how could we protect ourselves from other nations with nuclear weapons. 




 I am a pretty staunch libertarian, strong advocate for decentralization, and near ancap. I have a few reservations though. Perhaps y'all could help me.

1. What happens to nukes in Ancapistan? Obviously worldwide anarchism is not going to happen overnight, so even if the U.S. becomes a voluntary society, Russia, China etc will still have powerful weapons, and might seek to take advantage of what they see as a vulnerable situation. How do we as a society of individuals protect ourselves against these weapons? Also, what happens to the nukes the U.S government owns once it disbands?

2. Along those lines, how does a voluntary society protect itself from a sadistic individual obtaining a WMD? Say someone gets the money and ability to buy a powerful weapon. How do we stop him from killing thousands?

3. If the U.S. government disbanded, do you not see it as likely that another nation would try to use coercive force to take over? How could we possibly arm ourselves well enough to prevent that without a professional military.


These are just a few of my reservations. I definitely think liberty wins, and that ancap ideals can be implemented over a small scale, but I have a really hard time seeing it as a large scale option... 




 Gerbils, hamsters, ferrets, guinea pigs... all domesticated rodents. 




 I agree with what you are saying. Leftist descriptors are mostly slurs nowadays. Some libertarians do not understand the ideas behind leftist philosophy. This coming from a diehard capitalist.  




 I obviously disagree with them on fundamental issues, but the ignorance of many Americans about Socialism and Communism really bugs me. 


 









 Can someone recommend some libertarian debate videos? Anything liberty-related. 









 Can someone give me an easy explanation of the differences between socialist anarchism and anarcho-syndicalism? 




 Hey y'all. 

I am an active duty soldier nearing the end of my enlistment. I am seriously considering the railroad as a post-military career. Maybe y'all can help me with some questions.

1. I am currently a shop supply specialist. I oversee the order of parts for the motorpool, schedule services, keep track of inventory etc. A lot of supply and maintenance management. How do these skills translate into railroading?

2. Are the hours as bad as I hear? Being in the military has gotten me used to long hours, being away from my family, but I have heard many horror stories about railroading. 

3. How are the benefits? 
 




 I know y'all probably get a lot of these posts. I am sorry! 

I am interested in podcasts about 

Libertarianism

Art and literature

History

Social issues

Travel

Science fiction and fantasy


  




 As the title says I am an avowed laissez faire capitalist libertarian looking to engage some socialists respectfully. I have some honest questions, I am not trying to argue or pick a fight, just looking for a civil conversation.

1. What do you think the biggest misconceptions are about socialism?

2. What is your opinion as a full socialist about mixed economies (like the U.S) where the market is neither totally free or totally socialist?

3. Do you see any difference between laissez faire capitalism and crony capitalism?

4. What books or media would you recommend to me so I can honestly understand the socialist perspective?

5. What would change in the U.S if it became a fully socialist country?

6. What things do people think would change in the U.S. if it were a socialist country, but would actually remain the same. 


Sorry to lump my questions all together, I did not know of a better way. 

Thanks! 




 1. How long have you been a Wobbly/how did you become a Wobbly?

2. What has the IWW done to improve your life?

3. How do IWW members view other consolodated unions? It seems there are many who want "one big union" but they are all fragmented.

4. How has the IWW changed to fit modern workers needs in your opinion?

5. Do you think the IWW is on the decline? 




 **My 5 Questions:**

1. How long have you been a Wobbly/how did you become a Wobbly?

2. What has the IWW done to improve your life?

5. Do you thibk the IWW is on the decline?
 




 I am super obsessed with wanting to try [this](http://buy.rogue.com/rogue-sriracha-hot-stout-beer/). Has anyone here tried it? What is it like? 




 I get the basic idea, I know what Socialism is about, and I know that "libertarian" originally refered to socialists. I still don't get it.

1. Is libertarian socialism any different than regular socialism? How?

2. What the heck is anarcho-socialism about? Isn't the state a fundamental piece in the socialist theory?


Any other info would be great. 









 Hey y'all. I am going to be making a venison roast as the centerpiece for Christmas dinner this year. I am currently thinking about marinating it in red wine and black pepper then roasting it, but I thought I would ask Reddit for tips. Should I go in a different direction? 




 Do you see yourselves as counterculture or antiestablishment in realms of your life other than politics? 









 How much of an effect did the Treaty of Versailles have on the rise of Hitler? If the Treaty were more fair to Germany would the Nazi Party have still been able to take control? 









 Anything related to the labor movement, labor strikes, unionization etc. Books on these topics are pretty hard to find... 




 Worka that deal with political campaigns, political intrigue, fiction geared around politicians etc.  




 Can y'all recommend good fiction set during the Bolshevik Revolution/rise of Soviet Empire? 




 Basically self-explanatory. How much does readership factor into dateability for you? 




 I am looking to broaden my horizons. Please recommend rap/hip-hop for me? 

Something educated. Proper wordsmiths speaking about social issues/important issues. 

Nothing about partying, drugs, sex, etc. None of those things interest me.

I am not tryong to come off abrasive, I am genuinely looking to expand my horizons, but I need substance. 




 If you were to start dating a man who had PTSD
How soon should he tell you? It becomes a core part of the victim's identity.
How big of a factor would PTSD be when deciding whether to continue dating that person?
Do you personally feel that you would be able to date someone you knew from the beginning had PTSD?
There are no wrong answers, I am just curious as to opinions on this issue. Again, this is geared to be about someone you just recently started seeing/barely know yet.

 Do any of y'all keep a regular journal? If so, what kind? 




 I am an Anglican leaning Presbyterian who wants to implement a greater Advent awareness in my familiy's devotions. We are going to start using the BCP lectionary and Collects. What other things can we implement to deepen our Advent experience? 




 Which beer do you think goes well with Christmas? It does not have to be a seasonal beer necessarily, but any beer that tastes Christmasy to you.

For me it is actually Ommegang Witte. I know many see it as a refreshing summer beer (which it can be) but the spices and fruity overtones fit the holidays for me. 




 I am really into technical artwork, mechanical blueprints and cutaway art of machinery. Is there anywhere on the web I can gorge on scifi pics of imagined machines? 














 I think most of us feel the Army has made our lives better in some way. I am curious what life skills y'all would say the Army/deployment have given you? What specific ways have the Army made you a better person? 




 Putting together a playlist for a long ride, and I am curious what are some of y'alls favorite road trip songs? 




 For example, parents who leave children in hot cars, feeding kids horrible food and contributing to major health problems etc.

If so, is there a solution? 




 Honestly I was disappointed.. It was not content. I loved the idea, background, and setting. I think it was style. It was too short, too quick.. I barely had interaction with the setting, characters, or background. The "hook" was done poorly I thought. Things like that have to be done with subtlety, especially in short stories. It needed more buildup, more subtle shifting towards the two possible outside worlds..


**TL;DR** - Great idea, great setting, would have been better reworked as a novel with more time and depth. Barely three stars. 




 New guy here trying to get into GP. Please inform me?

Also, where does AMA Road racing and flat track racing fit into the picture? Is the AMA Road racing series completely unrelated to GP?  




 Does anyone know how I can find detailed technical manuals/drawings of various models of bikes? Is there a consolidated resource like this? 




 Just curious if any of y'all keep a journal for tobacco? I have been smoking pipes for a few years now, and I love trying new blends. I usually annotate the characteristics of new things I try, along with what kind of pipe I used, if I paired it with a beer or bourbon etc..

If you do keep a pipe/tobacco journal what layout do you use? 




 Can y'all give me some suggestions? I love vintage sound, I love pedal steel and old school sound engineering. I also like some more cowpunkish stuff. 

I love Nikki Lane, Justin Townes Earle, Willie Nelson, Haggard, Hank III's traditional stuff, and Jamey Johnson among others. 









 I am curious to learn more about liberty mindfulness in the Democratic Party.

1. Who were some liberty minded Democrats of the past?

2. Are there any liberty minded Democrats today?

3. What were some historic stands that Democrats took for liberty? 




 I am in a rented apartment, and rather than pay the exorbitant repair fee to the landlord, I figured I would just spackle it up and paint it myself. The issue is that my walls have textured paint, something like orange peel, and I do not know how to replicate the texture. Can someone offer advice? The scratches are not huge, and I just need to blend them in to the rest of the wall. 




 1. What is the general opinion amongst Marxists regarding Lenin?

2. Were the RSFSR and subsequent USSR successful communist systems? Are they good examples of what most modern day communists would like to see Capitalist countries imitate? 




 Do communist refute self ownership? How do communists view the relationship between an individual and his own self? 




 1. Did the TechnoCore remind anyone else of Asimov's MultiVac?

2. Did anyone else think Brawne Lamia came off sounding annoyingky similar to a 50's noir pulp-fiction detective character?

All in all it was a great book. 




 This sub is full of recommendations for *The Name of The Wind*. It's been on my TR list for a long time, but after hearing all the hype I moved it to the top of my list. I was very disappointed. Kvothe was really unbelievable for me. He was just too flawless. The magic system seemed heavily borrowed from Earth sea. I didn't hate it, I'm actually really interested to read the new book about Auri (the underthing was my favorite part) but the book only got three stars from me. 




 What are some good SF F websites to browse? I'm interested in SF F news, commentary, artwork, etc anything SF F related really.

What are the best places to check out?
