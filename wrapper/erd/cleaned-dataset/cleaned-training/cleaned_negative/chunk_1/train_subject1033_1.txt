 Just found this gem in the Christian Science Monitor's comments section, attributed to "Dan Henning":

"All the News media BLACKOUT with the Election FRAUD and Voter FRAUD on Dr. Paul is coming back to BITE EM HARD! Its called BLOWBACK..Dr. Paul has warned America about it but the Sheep just keep tuning into the Lamestreammedia..and take every word as gosple..guess what SHEEP? You've been had. You Tube Ron Paul or go to "the daily paul .com for Gods Sake..learn the TRUTH! Rombama aint going to win..you best open your eyes and get on the Dr. Paul R3VOLUTION STEAM ROLLER, because come Aug in Tampa Fl. you will witness something thats going to BLOW YOUR MINDS..I cant wait to be there!" 







































 "It is the hip-hop thing to do among the urban youth who play unsuspecting whites like pianos.  In the old days, average people could avoid such youth by staying out of bad neighborhoods. Empowered by media, police and political complicity, however, the youth now roam everywhere looking for cars to steal and people to rob.

"What can you do? More and more Americans are carrying a gun in the car. An ex-cop I know advises that if you have to use a gun on a youth, you should leave the scene immediately, disposed of the wiped off gun as soon as possible. Such a gun cannot, of course, be registered to you, but one bought privately (through the classifieds, for example).

"I frankly dont know what to make of such advice, but even in my little town of Lake Jackson, Texas, Ive urged everyone in my family to know how to use a gun in self defense. For the animals are coming." 

*from the Ron Paul Newsletters*

 Even more importantly, how exactly does such a noble concept as "the sanctity of life" suddenly decay into the tooth-grinding rage that brands these former fetuses and their mothers as "welfare scum"?

 2012: The Year of Linux on the Desktop. 









 "Eric Dondero, Paul's estranged former volunteer and personal aide, worked for Paul on and off between 1987 and 2004 (back when he was named "Eric Rittberg"), and since the Iraq war has become one of the congressman's most vociferous and notorious critics. By Dondero's account, Paul's inner circle learned between his congressional stints that *"the wilder they got, the more bombastic they got with it, the more the checks came in. You think the newsletters were bad? The fundraising letters were just insane from that period." [italics added.]*  Cato Institute President Ed Crane told reason he recalls a conversation from some time in the late 1980s in which Paul claimed that his best source of congressional campaign donations was the mailing list for The Spotlight, the conspiracy-mongering, anti-Semitic tabloid run by the Holocaust denier Willis Carto until it folded in 2001."

 Mrs. Paul's. 




 Who paid the police overtime? Which public works guys cut down the trees? Who paid for the garbage trucks to crush and cart away tents, food, bicycles, and books to a public landfill?

Is this another case of the private class privatizing the profits and socializing the losses?



 









 *By NBCs Anthony Terrell and Domenico Montanaro

CARROLL, Iowa -- Ron Paul outlined what he believed was the difference between Occupy Wall Street and the Tea Party.

Some are demonstrating, because theyre scared to death they wont get their handouts, Paul said yesterday. And the other half are demonstrating, because theyre sick and tired of paying for it. Im on the side of sick and tired of paying for it.

Paul's popularity has risen since 2008 largely because of the Tea Party. He doesn't lead in polling in any state, but he is routinely in the top three in states like Iowa and New Hampshire.*

Discuss. 




 Just curious. 









 May you find peace and rest.

 1968: George Wallace and the "American Independent" party.

1980: Ronald Reagan convinces lower-middle class Americans that they will become millionaires if only they approve massive tax cuts for multimillionaires. The multimillionaires become billionaires; everyone else: the impoverished, the lower-middle class, and the middle class are forced to eat dirt, but persist in their belief Reagan is a American saint. 

1992: Ross Perot, to be followed by his "U-nited We Stand, America" party.

1994: Newt Gingrich and the "Republican Revolution."

1998: Newt Gingrich and the Clinton Impeachment. While he presided over the impeachment trial of Clinton for getting blown by a young staffer, Gingrich was himself getting blown by a young staffers (while he was on his second wife. That young staffer's name? Callista; she is now his third wife, and evidently quite fond of shopping at Tiffany's.)

2000: Ralph Nader decides that if Ross Perot could pull 20% of the vote in 1992 and 14% in 1996 despite being a complete whackjob, *surely* he could pull 5% in every state. Nader aligns himself with the "Green Party" in hopes of winning Federal matching funds. He was very much mistaken. He doesn't break 1% in *any* state, but he takes 91,000 votes in Florida; this is enough to throw Florida to George W. Bush.

2001-2009: George W. Bush and Dick Cheney. If you don't remember the hell they unleashed, go look it up.

2008: Sarah Palin.

2010: The "spontaneous, up-from-the-grassroots" Tea Party movement. Realizing that Ross Perot won the rageful, spiteful votes of a certain segment of the American population, a motley crew of Republican political advisors, Libertarian brothers (and multibillionaires from birth,) join forces with a right-wing media billionaire to re-run the Ross Perot campaign, minus Ross Perot. 

2011: The "TeaPublicans" determine that they will "save America" by steering our ship of state directly off a cliff into a vast canyon. No sane American of any political stripe
 




 We, as Americans, realize that our National Parks belong to all of us.

The same applies to the resources under our land and under our waters.

Why, then, do we lease out our lands and water to private, for-profit corporations who then extract America's natural resources, process them, and sell the products to right back to us, the ones that owned it in the first place? Every penny they've ever generated in profit comes from the resources they've extracted

Maybe it's time we spoke up for America and Americans, rather than worshipping at the altar of the Corporatists. They take our resources for *fractions* of pennies on the dollar, and sell it back to us at a truly astonishing markup.

It's one of the greatest scams ever, and it's gone on for nearly 125 years now. We give away *trillions* to them for next to nothing. If you want to get mad about something, get mad about this. Yet, there are those among us who would blame schoolteachers for our economic plight.

We don't owe any allegiance, nor profit, nor to these private, for-profit  interests. We pledge allegiance to the United States of America, not Exxon/Mobil, nor Shell, nor BP, nor Chevron, nor ARCO. Defend these private interests if you must, but don't delude yourselves that they can, have, or will *ever* show any allegiance to us in return for what we have so foolishly given away for so long.

Perhaps we should pledge our allegiance to ourselves, and our nation. 

 




 Followed a Rachel Maddow link to Palin's Facebook page.This was the most recent comment ("about an hour ago"):

[*name redacted out of a sense of shame for hapless Facebook poster*] "why do we have to suffer because of the debt why can't we cut the aid to other countries in half? that would save us enough money to pay off the debt and would not have to interfere with medicare, medicad nor with our social security, i'm just saying who is none of the people we vote for to protect us can't see this. i am just an american of every day person and I CAN SEE THIS but no we have to suffer cause our congressmen can't do this for the american people"

 Will they go after the 12 members of the Casey Anthony jury, too? 









 A nation eager for freedom and liberty awaits your response. 









 Punishing them makes us no wealthier.

We chronically undervalue our own financial worth anyway, and it doesn't look as if any of us will be getting a life-changing raise soon.

The solution isn't to tighten the thumbscrews on Congress; the solution is to value ourselves, and the work that each of us do for ourselves and  the nation.

One Congressman's salary sounds about equivalent to what it takes to provide a good, solid foundation, provide a reasonable existence, and a path to a comfortable retirement for a family of four. Let's use that as baseline, inclusive of health care benefits and vacation time.

Why? Because we're Americans, and we not only owe it to ourselves, we have quite literally *earned* it. 

America, you've earned a reasonable existence, solid health care, a few weeks of vacation each year with the kids, and stable golden years. The question is, are we American enough to accept what we've already earned for ourselves?

Value your own worth, and that of all of your American neighbors. My life as an American is a bit worse today, because somewhere within our borders today, one of my fellow Americans died from cancer that would have been caught years ago, had it been diagnosed. One of my fellow Americans ended his life today because he can't find work and would rather die than ask for help.

We've earned it. Are we American enough to accept for ourselves and each of our fellow Americans that which we have already earned?

Let's make this Fourth of July one to remember.

If every American resolves to honor each and every one of his fellow Americans *as* an American, there is no peak we cannot surmount. It's all that's united us and saved us before, and no one's changed the prescription.

We WILL get through this, if we honor one another, and treat ourselves and one another as we ourselves would like to be treated. Our grandparents and great-grandparents proved our resilience, and we could do far worse than follow the example of those we rightfully call "the Greatest Generation." 









 They defrost and dump hundreds of embryos daily. Some go straight down the sink; others find their way into Biohazard bags to be burned.

Why all the fuss over Women's Health Clinics? Why hassle women trying to get pap smears? Why murder their doctors? Why not march with obnoxious signs on the in-vitro labs, where far more fetuses are obliterated daily?

An informational query. 









 Drug kingpins.

Think of it! Never a tax, never a regulation, never some meddlesome bureaucrat poking through your books, or hassling you over quality control. And forget about pesky firearms laws -- not only can you buy arms/weapons in any quantity you like, but you can raise a private army to use them for you against those you decree must die. 

In the realm of *truly* free markets, drug lords are king. Who are we to penalize their success? They earned it. 




 B-I-N-G-O! 




 I mean, their devotion is admirable. It's like my own private C-SPAN!

I will admit, though, that a moment or two to myself would be nice once in a while. Perfect example: after a meet-and-greet with the Jaycees this morning, I was followed into the Denny's restroom by a group of men in T-shirts, stained jeans, and mounds and mounds of facial hair. They kept talking about how Linus (the blanket kid from Peanuts?) could help us line up an account with the FedEx, something something involving gold, something about Fiats also (crappy Italan cars?) They were nice enough, maybe a little awkward socially, but seemed to be decent young fellows and dedicated to the cause of liberty. I finally sent them on their way by autographing ten or so toilet seat covers.

Well, back to it. Who knew so many of my fans were proficient in Gregg shorthand?

P.S.: left tip in doubloons. 

 














 He's the right-wing billionaire-from-birth who spent tens of millions of dollars in his attempt to destroy Bill Clinton.

The only right-wing billionaires in the news these days are the multibillionaires Charles and David Koch, who just like Scaife rose to prominence with the money that their daddies left them.

What's Richard Mellon Scaife up to these days? And as long as we're talking about pouty, greedy billionaire-by-inheritance boys, how about Steve Forbes?  




 Count me among those who say Adobe Flash is "the past." Other, far superior alternatives to Adobe Flash exist.

I've often wondered why those who hate Apple/the Mac/iOS and snidely label Apple's ecosystem a "closed, proprietary system" refuse to evolve and embrace the open standards of HTML 5. Yet, they scream like little children who've had their Popsicles stolen when obsolete Adobe Flash and *its* closed, proprietary system, a fossilized artifact of Web 0.3b, acquired via Adobe's takeover of Macromedia back in the 90s, are ignored in favor of far superior alternatives.

I really don't understand this bizarre fixation on Flash. Continuing to support Flash with all of its well-known and well-documented instabilities and security risks makes about as much sense as demanding that all programs in 2011 be written in Basic.

Seriously, *what's with this Flash fixation?*  Is it some sort of offshoot of Stockholm Syndrome? Do people believe that when Flash dies, their free internet porn will go away? [It won't.] If they even remember RealMedia/RealPlayer, did today's Adobe Flash sycophants feel the same way when Real's third-rate shit software and delivery capabilities [*Buffering . . . . . . Buffering . . . . . .* ] died from both obsolescence and user frustration at Real's utter ineptitude? Will anyone besides basement-dwellers who make drag-and-drop porn banner ads with Flash actually miss it?

Can anyone explain this? *What's with this irrational love for Flash?* You might as well demand that Apple support Betamax. 




 This is why they'll never be "pro-life."

They are "pro-birth."

There's a world of difference. 




 The Republicans can't believe it either, but they're happy to cater to these loons as long as the money keeps rolling in, and their precincts get walked.

This whole thing is irrelevant, as due to the Hyde Amendment *not a penny of Federal money has gone to abortion services in decades.*

In private, when they're being honest, the Republicans have a greater and more snide contempt for anti-abortionists than does any liberal --but because of the political support the Repubs are happy to toss them a bone once in a while. Such is this "Planned Parenthood" red herring.
 









 Why/why not? 









 Any guesses? 




 I don't mind paying to help Reddit out; but if they're going to charge for that which is otherwise free, they'd better be able to provide a stable and accessible site.

If they charge and can't deliver, they either need to charge more until they can afford to provide the service, or go all-free.

 Do you guys realize that the Republicans/Koch Astroturfers are absolutely laughing their asses off at you behind your backs?

You guys think liberals think you're stupid? The Koch Republicans *know* you're stupid. What kind of fucking idiots (people who actually had their own taxes *cut* by Obama, though they believe the opposite is true) would actually go to their corporate-funded Uncle Sam cosplay rallies and scream about "socialist takeovers" because their multibillionaire masters will have to pay 2 cents more per dollar of income?

You think liberals mock you? Republicans *detest* you. They take great pleasure in grinding your faces into the shit and dirt, then tricking you into blaming the liberals for it.

Remember: the American Right uses you to do all their heavy lifting, which only serves their selfish interests while undermining yours. Do you believe they have any respect for those who would work like dogs against their own best interests?

It's a lot easier to print up ten million plastic American flags in China and pepper the crowd with a few puffy-shirted, tri-corner-hatted, out-of-work-actors shouting out Tea Party slogans mixed with misquoted Founders and "patriotize" you into doing their dirty work.

Remember, every time you see them talking about "taking America back" on TV or at a rally, ***they are all laughing their asses off at you*** the ***instant*** your backs are turned.* 

Painful but accurate analogy for you: if your personal liquid assetts are *less* than $10,000,000 and you buy into the "Tea Party" narrative, you're no different or less foolish than a black American marching in support of the KKK.

 In fact, the iPad's lack of Flash is what I would characterize as a feature/selling point. 














 The impression i've had is that iPhone/iPad software was the same OS, now iOS4, which is itself a subset of Mac OS X.

In fact, I remember earlier versions of the iPhone OS reported as being a lean but full Mac OS X install.

Does anyone know? And if it is the same OS, why couldn't we run iOS4 on iPads today? 









 Hackers have planted viruses in video games for smart phones running on Microsoft Corp's Windows operating system, according to a security firm specializing in mobile devices.

The games  3D Anti-Terrorist and PDA Poker Art  are available on sites that provide legitimate software for mobile devices, according to John Hering, chief executive officer of the San Francisco-based security firm Lookout.

The games are bundled with malicious software that automatically dials premium-rate telephone services in Somalia, Italy and other countries, sometimes ringing up hundreds of dollars in charges in a single month.

 You want to end illegal immigration tomorrow, Arizona?

Put a $10,000 fineper illegal, per dayon everyone who HIRES an illegal.

Whoops! Bet that won't go over too well with the Republicans who race-bait you with this issue, would it? Their buddies in agribusiness wouldn't be too happy about it, for one. 

SOPick your own fucking vegetables, build your own fucking house, mow your own fucking lawn, make your own fucking food, bus your own fucking tables, wash your own fucking dishes, wash and iron your own fucking clothes, make up your own fucking motel rooms, and [scariest of all, I know,] WATCH YOUR OWN FUCKING CHILDREN. 

My $10,000 per illegal, per day fine on *EMPLOYERS* ends illegal immigration TOMORROW, Republicans. 

Bet your Party's big-ticket donations would dry up *very* quickly, eh? And you'd lose your favorite "DEY TURK YER JERBS!" argument.

Here in America we have a saying: Money talks, and bullshit walks. So, Republicans, are you going to go after the *real* reason illegal immigrants come here? They come because they're PAID to by your major donors, who must have their cheap labor. 









 For decades, conservatives have preached the benefits of personal responsibility and explained human success or failure via a theory of Social Darwinism. By this logic, the good and noble of society rise and prosper; those left behind in society have only themselves and their lack of dedication and virtue to blame.

Conservatives have long been very free with their criticisms of others; they'll sneer at the destitute or unemployed and say, "[Ross Perot/Ronald Reagan/Chuck Norris] made it in life; that shows it's possible.  Why can't you, *loser?!* HAHAHA!"

Obama's election means only to them that they have to eat their own words.  If a black guy from a very modest background can become President, it only underscores that they themselves *aren't* President, or anything even approaching the same level of importance or prestige.

Worse still, it proves to them they don't even possess the skills or abilities to achieve such heights. It shows them they were outdone by a better educated, more diligent, more dedicated guya better educated, more diligent, more dedicated *black* guy. 

Since they are happy neither with themselves nor their station in life, Obama's achievements just serve to underscore their own personal failures. Subconsciously they apply their Social Darwinist thinking to Obama, then look at themselves; they *really* don't like the result of that matchup.

As President, Obama is on TV and in the news daily; they can't escape news, images, and discussions of him. Every one of Obama's successes only serves to underscore their own failures.  This is why they have to constantly tear him down.  It's their means of mental self-preservation.

Thus, they don't just hate Obama because he's black; they hate him because he's black and is "better'n [me.]" 




 Does anyone have any recommendations for a Bluetooth headset, or units to avoid?

I'm particularly interested in which units are the most comfortable.

If so, are there any apps that work with a Bluetooth headset? 




 Every time you receive a medical service, 30% of the cost of that procedure goes straight to a Health Insurance Corporation (HIC).

Why should they get a 30% cut just for existing? What value do they provide to patients or doctors?
