 I hardly doubt Romanians or Bulgarians were holding off working in the UK cause of these restrictions. I believe those who wanted to leave did that already. British tabloids played a dirty role in making a fuss out of nothing. 




 Enlighten us brother. 




 The Guardian has a different take on the report than the BBC http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2013/apr/05/eastern-european-migrants-report "Romanian and Bulgarian migrants 'unlikely to head for UK'  report" 




 I work for an IT infrastructure company.

Fortunately, I am not. It's a horrible thing that such a beautiful word is used by such a horrible tabloid. Someone should sue. 




 I love it all. The people, the language and the country. From The Netherlands. I live around 6 months a year down here. The rest is spent between Holland and the U.S. 




 Thanks for the clarification! Still got lots of Romanian language (Romanian slang/street talk) to learn! 




 Same here. It was working fine when I initially listened to it. 




 Is that a bad thing? (before getting pissed off that I am not writing in Romanian, I am not a Romanian. I do however live here)

 I actually had a conversation with a group of Russian friends - not that they like Putin but per se but they agree on having a strong leader in their country. Corruption seems to be one of the main reasons.

 This might help answer that question: http://spectrum.ieee.org/aerospace/astrophysics/what-curiosity-will-and-wont-teach-us-about-martian-life

Over the years, planetary scientists have had to significantly revise their expectations for what they might find. In 1976, when the first successful Mars landersViking 1 and Viking 2reached the planets surface, many had high hopes that the spacecrafts instruments would be able to settle whether lifeeven simple microbial lifeexisted on the Red Planet. Each of the Viking landers carried a suite of instruments, including a combination gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer that was designed to detect organic compounds liberated from heated samples. But none of the Viking instruments found convincing evidence for the existence of life, or even its most basic ingredients.

About 30 years later, NASAs Phoenix Mars Lander made a discovery that may explain why the Viking spacecraft came up dry. In 2008, Phoenix found abundant amounts of the potent oxidizing agent perchlorate in the Martian soil. Perchlorate can destroy organic compounds released during sample heating, and it may also be able to destroy organic material in the upper layers of Martian soil, well before it is scooped into a spacecraft sample chamber. The surmise is that, if organic compounds exist on Mars, perchlorate may have prevented them from being picked up by Vikings instruments.

Curiosity could finally settle that question. The rovers Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument includes a mass spectrometer and a gas chromatograph, just as the Viking spacecraft did. But each of these instruments now boasts much better capabilities. Working in concert, they will be able to detect trace amountsat the level of a few parts per billionof organic compounds released from the stepwise heating of samples retrieved from surface soils and cores of rocks. Although this level of sensitivity isnt too different from Vikings, Curiosity will be able to heat the samples up to greater than 1000 C, twice the peak temperature of the Viking instrument set. That will help liberate materials that might otherwise stay trapped and inert in a sample. Whats more, SAMs analysis protocol calls for adding substances that can reduce the temperatures at which organic compounds are released from samples. Perchlorate salts are thought to be released only at higher temperatures, and with this procedure, samples will be heated to only 350 C, which should reduce their tendency to decompose.
