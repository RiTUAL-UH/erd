 I don't think the race is a necessary descriptor here
 




 The stadium looks a lot emptier now... 




 I'm really digging Croatia's kit 




 GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL 




 Here's what happened, and here's a digital recreation. It looks just like what we showed you, see?? Preeeetty nifty. 




 The country might literally become a failed state 




 There was homophobia?

Edit: Thanks for the prompt responses, I remember the "boy-lover" quote but I kind of consider that just criticism of pedophilia. It's still completely historically inaccurate for the Spartans to be critical of that, but I wouldn't say it's "homophobic" in itself.  But from what you're all telling me this Miller dude does sound like an asshole, and he probably is a homophobe himself. 




 There's a jazz subreddit for everything!

/r/jazzhands? Oh, no apparently not...hm.../r/jazzflute? Huh. I'm a little disappointed. 




 Or requests for war stories from visitors misunderstanding the focus of the sub. 














 You seem a bit tense 




 The best way to win in Civ. 




 Ooh very nice. Thank you. 




 Is there a line graph for this? 




 It sounds like something straight out of *Fallout.* 




 [Why are we changing maps?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLqC3FNNOaI) 




 Do you work there? How were you able to describe this in so much detail? 




 OH MY GOD. 




 Jesus. I'm sorry but where did this actually come from? Did somebody originally type this as a serious comment? 




 Lol somebody isn't STEM hahaha. DAE love getting a job out of college and being better than everyone else? 




 Most of the time, yes. I actually pay attention to the NYT comments because the readers' picks and NYT picks are often insightful! Idk if other newspapers do that, though. Maybe the WSJ. 




 Nationalism is an important factor for WWII. Perhaps not *quite* as much in France and GB but nationalism had a huge role in justification and cause for the Nazi party's actions and policies.

It's not the sole cause of either war, but it's an important factor in both. 




 Upvotes just for saying the name. God I love that movie, it's why I wanted to become a paleontologist.

I never did become one :( 




 Then again, most stylists probably make more money if you buy both their shampoo and their conditioner.

/r/Conspiracy 




 Oh. I thought it was just a historical reference. TIL. 




 Wait since when did the TEA become an acronym? Why is it all caps? 




 ? 




 With regard to the categories, a glossary is provided at the bottom. 




 The human head weighs eight pounds! 




 BTW that test was actually only at half the strength! They had designed it to be up to around 100 MT but scaled it to half that in the interest of safety so the bombers could fly out of range of the blast in time.

Just a cool tidbit on how fucking big that bomb actually was. 




 Hahahaa...I'm getting nothing done tonight...sighhhhhh... 














 You can have all the girls you want if you STOP HOSTING YOUR GIFS ON MINUS. 




 Disagree: there are many delicious Mexican restaraunts. They are the only redeeming quality of that town. 









 Right there with you. Too bad I'm stuck here. They have way too much power... 



















 For a quick, extremely well-written read on war in Europe, I recommend *War In European History* by Michael Howard.

It covers a lot of what you talked about, and more! 




 POLAN STRONK 




 I would disagree and say a 7.5 




 I can always count on /r/science to have one of the top comments be bitching about the article title rather than discussing the article itself. 




 GO DAWGS 




 For additional reading I would suggest Horkheimer and Adorno's *Diaclectic of Enlightenment*, for political theorist's explanation for fascism in the context of the Enlightenment, written during the Second World War. You could even just read the first chapter and be a bit more, well, enlightened. 




 interesting choice of thumbnail... 




 "Panamanorama" 




 Or worsen it...worth it...? Tough question. 




 didn't he just shoot someone the other day? Or was that just a rumor? I just saw a headline somewhere.
