 For a long time I've been doing weighted pullups by attaching plates to a belt with a chain, but lately I've been increasingly annoyed by the fact that the plates aren't stable, as they move back and forth. This causes balance issues and prevents me from doing the pullups as stricly as I want to. I'm thinking of putting a dumbbell in between my two 'lower' legs instead. I've seen a friend do this for weighted dips and it seemed to work well. Only downside is you need someone to place the weight for you, pretty much. Has anyone ever tried this and could give me feedback?

Thanks in advance.  









 It is, like some of the research I've read states, definitly a powerful fat loss agent. It doesn't work on cattle only, it works on humans too. 

I ended my bulk 2 weeks ago, on December 28th, 2014, at 220 lb and around 15% body fat. During those 2 weeks of cut that followed the end of the bulk, I still ate like a pig (250 calories above my TDEE compared to 650 during my bulk). Even in spite of that, I lost over 20 pounds. However, I don't know of much of it is water weight and how much of it is actually fat, as it's not really possible to tell. 

During the first week, I administered Clenbuterol orally, in tablet format. Each tablet is 20mcg; I started with a single tablet, and then administered one more tablet every day until reaching 100mcg. In the second week, I used the same daily quantity, except that I administered it in liquid form, through injection. I used a 18g 1.5" pin to draw, and a 23g 1" one to inject. Based on my calculations, 1000mcg of tablet format Clenbuterol is equal to roughly 1 mL of the liquid format, so I injected 0.1 mL daily during the second week (because 100mcg = 0.1 mL). You don't have to use both formats by the way, I just did so because I wanted to test both, to see which one worked best for me; turns out I actually had less of the side effects from injecting, although this might have nothing to do with the format of administration at all. 

During those 2 weeks, I also administered 3 1000mg taurine capsules daily. As [studies](http://jap.physiology.org/content/93/5/1824) have shown, Clenbuterol depletes taurine 
levels in the liver, which stops the conversion of the thyroid hormone  triiodothyronine into thyroxine. This, in turn, has been reported to result in painful muscle cramps in many users that I've talked to. 

Training wise, I avoided all forms of HIIT; simply walking on a treadmill for about 45 min daily was pretty exhausting. I also followed a fairly standard 4-day heavy weight workout routine, with 2 days for upper body and 2 days for legs. This is because, like I said, my goal was to maintain muscle mass and strength as much as possible despite being on a lower caloric intake. 

Nutrition wise, my fast-digesting carbohydrate intake cycled naturally, as I had none on rest days. On the other hand, my overall carbohydrate intake was pretty consistent (40% of my daily caloric intake every day).

That's it. If you have any other questions, throw them at me and I will do my best to answer them. That was just my personal experience by the way, it might not reflect what you or other people have experienced using Clenbuterol. Personally, though, I will definitly use it again. The side effects that I experienced (dizziness, night sweats, increased sweating, dry mouth) were definitly worth it!

Be warned headphone users, watching this video could kill you.

For me, though, it was so much motivation that I murdered my leg workout.

That strength though. Some high school football kids are impressive. Anyone knows this guy's name?  





























 There seems to be no serious research on the subject, and I cannot find an unbiased website (that is, one that doesn't sell AAS-related products) that discusses it. 

Aside from the obvious dangers of using Lyothyronine alone, does it actually work? Is it more effective than if you use drugs like ephedrine only?  




 I just tried the vertical leg press for the first time today, at the end of my butt workout. I didn't think too much of the exercise, but I noticed my hips were flexing a lot more than on, say, the angled leg press machine. 

I was re-reading [this article](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12173958) (also available in PDF on Google), and in randomized trials they found a link between hip flexion and degree of involvement of the gluteal muscles. Because of this, I'm thinking of adding the vertical leg press to my current glutes workout. My workout is currently this (some kind of experimental 'pre-exhaustion' butt day):

50% 1RM back squat 4x12-15 + Jump squats 4x12-15 superset

Cable glute kickbacks 4x-20-25 per leg

Barbell glute bridges 4x8-10

Does anyone else have experience with the vertical leg press? Not sure how to integrate it into my routine. Should I go heavy at the end after the bridges? 



 









 *1. [CrossFit's Filthy Fifty](http://www.crossfit.com/mt-archive2/001550.html) 

I'm not a big fan of the whole Xfit thing, but this is not for the faint of heart. Imagine doing a full body workout and high intensity cardio at the same time, and you get this, an extreme circuit training workout. You have to do 50 reps of 10 different exercises, with no break in between the exercises, and as fast as humanly possible while keeping a good form. I did this a couple times back when I was mostly concerned with losing body fat, and as someone who's more into weight lifting than cardio, this was one of the hardest things I've ever done. It's good for all athletes, because it challenges your muscular strength, muscular endurance and cardiovascular ability all at once.


*2. [Smolov Squat's Intense Mesocycle](http://www.seriouspowerlifting.com/3615/articles/smolov-squat-routine)

Possibly the toughest powerlifting and squat routine that exists. This is part of Smolov' 15 week powerlifting routine, the base cycle of which is also used for the bench press and a few others compound exercises. The whole Smolov routine is also known as 'The Test', because it will test whether you actually know what you are doing when it comes to nutrition and weight lifting.  This is by no stretch of the imagination a cutting program, and it is critical that you rest and eat properly, and that you lift with a good form. If you go through it doing everything correctly, you will come out a LOT stronger than you were before starting; if you don't, at best you will have poor strength gains, and at worst, you will also come out with an injury. If things don't go well during the base cycle, do not even attempt this. 


*3. [Charles Poliquin's German Volume Training (GVT) method](http://www.muscleandfitness.com/workouts/workout-routines/german-volume-training-build-more-size-6-weeks)

Possibly the greatest mass-building training routine, this isn't complex, or long, it's just brutally painful. 2 exercises in one superset, 1 push and 1 pull, 90 sec. of rest in between each superset, and 10 series of 10 reps for each of the two exercises, all with a 4-0-2 tempo. You're basically lifting for 20 minutes over a period of one hour. I did this recently, and made some spectacular muscular mass gains. I also ate like a horse while doing this. 


*4. [Jason Feruggia's Complex of Time](http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/sports_body_training_performance/the_six_toughest_workouts)

An extreme and heavy-weight version of circuit training that is mainly used by bodybuilders in their cutting phase. Possibly the best workout for losing bodyfat and maintaining muscular mass and strength as much as possible at the same time. Even though this is a workout designed for general conditioning and bodyfat loss, I would not attempt this while being on more than a slight caloric deficit. 


*5. [Charles Poliquin's Deadlift from Hell](http://www.muscleandstrength.com/articles/snatch-grip-deadlifts-muscle-growth)

This training program has a single exercise: the platform snatch grip deadlift. It's possibly the best weight lifting exercise that exists, and it's certainly one of the best muscle building exercises out there. You can add some complementary exercises, mostly ones that will help you with the deadlifting itself, but this exercise alone will leave your entire body exhausted. Do not attempt this unless you have mastered the regular deadlift form,  obviously.


This is my personal top 5. Do you guys know any other brutally hard weight lifting routines?

Edit: I'm not saying these are actually the 5 toughest gym routines. This is just in my opinion/based on my own experience. All these workouts are definitly hard, though. None of these are for the beginning lifter. 
  




 Just looking for feedback on how it went, if anyone did try it. I wanna try it, but I'm not sure if it's actually a good idea.  












































 http://www.steroid.com/steroids_side_effects.php#

I know steroids are a controversial topic and illegal in many countries, but, as an aspiring bodybuilder who has considered using steroids more than once in his life, this is the greatest read I have ever come cross about steroids.

It doesn't just say 'steroids are good' or 'steroids are bad'; instead, it takes every side effect usually associated with AAS use, and looks at what serious scientific studies say on the subject. 

In my opinion, reads like this are a must if one is to form an educated opinion on the highly complex and controversial topic that AAS are. 

You might think 'I have never considered using steroids and I never will either, so how should this be of any concern to me?'. Well, like I said, AAS are a huge topic, and a lot of people out there say different things about it, but very few of these people actually back up their sayings with reliable research. Also, AAS have been used by a lot of top-level athletes throughout the second half of the 20th century and into the first half of the 21st one, so this is definitly related not only to fitness, but also to the reality of the world in which we live as of currently, in 2015. 










































































 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/enhanced/doi/10.1002/bies.201400071/ 
I apologize in advance if the vocabulary is a little hard to understand for some, but this is a really interesting scientific article. Basically, it states that certain theories, like people's 'lack of willpower' to eat healthy and an evolutionary mismatch between our current environment and the ability to store food in the face of scarce resources, are not enough to explain food cravings and obesity like it was previously believed. 

Instead, food cravings are mainly caused by an evolutionary mismatch between people and the bacteria that live in their gut; certain gut bacteria process certain nutrients better, leading to a power-struggle between them in which the dominant bacteria 'hijack' the neural axis between the brain and the gut and, in turn, influence us to eat the food products that contain these nutrients.

 This is an important paradigm shift in our understanding of human eating behaviors, as it suggests that obesity isn't a result of an evolutionary mismatch between the humans and their external environment, but rather, a mismatch between the human body and the beings that live within the environment of which it is itself made.

I am truly amazed by this. 

P.S.: if you want to gain insight into the subject, don't just read my short summary posted here. Read the article itself. It is far more complicated than just what I've said in my original post. 

edit: I've realized that people have interpreted this as being an excuse to not eat properly and work hard in the gym. This article certainly isn't suggesting that, and neither am I by posting it. It is not my intention to give people an excuse to not do their best. Like some people have stated, this articles merely looks at the 'why's' of people have food cravings. I found it genuinely interesting and wanted to share this with you guys, as it relates to nutrition and fitness. That's it. 

edit 2: I really wish I could re-do the title. I apologize for this title. 

edit 3: This thread really exploded, I can't keep up with all the answers anymore. :/

However, I have read almost all of them, and I would like to address a few points. Firstly, I cannot apologize enough for the biased and somewhat misleading title. I would re-do it if I could, I assure you. Secondly, the idea of 'willpower' is never actually mentioned by the authors. They talk about how some scientists have argued that there is no 'self-control', in that the 'self' as we understand it doesn't actually exist, and is instead merely a set of highly contextualized cognitive responses based on fluctuations in brain activity. Another [study](http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/jocn_a_00650#.VJ9gB14CA) not mentioned by the authors of this article also found this. This is essentially where my idea on 'lack of willpower' comes from, but it is merely my interpretration. But as you can see, the idea is problematic in itself, as things like 'free will', 'self' and 'self-control' are hot topics within the scientific community. Thirdly, and most importantly, the author states that self-control ALONE cannot explain why we have cravings. This is where I messed up really badly in my title: I should have added the word 'alone'. The authors' main point is that previously prevalent theories on lack of self-control and evolutionary mismatch between humans and their external environment are not enough to explain food cravings; instead, they are primarily stemmed from a power struggle between bacteria in people's own gut. 

Again, I am sorry for messing up the title. But I still think this article is definitly worth reading and discussing extensively.  





























 Basically, title. Although me and my girlfriend are pretty open about this stuff and she knows that I watch porn and doesn't mind, I never told her about what kind of porn I watch specifically, because I didn't think it mattered. But apparently it does.

She came across my web browsing history recently, and realized that I only watch lesbian porn. And she thinks it's creepy and doesn't understand why. I tried explaining to her, but the truth, I don't really know why myself. I've watched all sorts of porn, and lesbian porn is the only sort that actually turns me on. I'm not turned off by seeing another man's penis in a porn video, but it doesn't have any effect on me either. It's like watching TV and seeing an ad about something random you don't really care about and staring blankly as you wait for it to end so you can watch what you actually turned on the TV for. I feel the same way when watching most porn videos. The only thing that I enjoy watching and which arouses me is lesbian porn. But I don't really know how to break it down to my girlfriend.

edit: To add to my OP, she said that she doesn't know any other guy who exclusively watches lesbian porn, and she thinks it's creepy that I watch so much of it. She seriously asked if I sometimes imagine her having sex with another attractive girl that we know and that we always see when we go to the gym. 

 



















 **Places**

-The Walled World: a reference to both Asgard and Midgard. Asgard was the realm of the Aesir gods. It was surrounded by huge walls which had been built by a giant. Midgard was the realm of the humans, and was surrounded by Jotunheimr, the world of the giants.

-Castle Utgard: a reference to Utgard, a stronghold of the giants in Jotunheimr. 

-RBA's 'shifter village': a reference to the homeland of the Vaenir gods. They possess powerful magic, and keep the location of their home village a secret; no one knows where it is.


**Characters**

-Ymir: a reference to Ymir, a hermaphroditic giant who was the progenitor of all other giants. Ymir was born when the icy winds and the fire met, and from his body the two first giants were born. From the giant cow that fed Ymir, a humanoid was also born. The first female giant and that humanoid came together, and from their union the first gods were born. The third generation of gods would later kill Ymir, and use his body to make the world of the humans, thus beginning the age-old feud between giants and gods. It is said that, after Ragnark, the final battle between giants and gods, Ymir will be reborn into a human. 

-Grisha Yeager: a reference to Surtr, a fire giant who fought and killed many powerful gods during the great war of Ragnark, most importantly Freyr, the brother of the Vanir goddess Freya. At the end of the war, he used his blazing sword to literally 'engulf the world in flame', and from the ashes a new world was reborn in which the humans and gods who had survived came together to start over.

-Freida Reiss: a reference to Freya, the Vanir goddess who lived in the world of the Aesir gods and who was renowned for her ability to alter the course of destinity by changing people's minds through the practice of a form of magic known as Seir (Seidr). 

-The Beast Titan: a reference to Skrymir, the giant who lived at Utgard in Jotunheimr and would 'play' with his visitors by testing their strengths, weaknesses and limits.


**Concepts**

-Titan-shifters, 'mindless' titans and humans: in Norse mythology, the three most important groups are the giants, the gods and the humans. Although it is unclear which is which in SnK, in Norse mythology all three groups are related either through ancestry (both giants and gods descend from Ymir), interbreeding or both. The idea that, in SnK, titan-shifters, 'mindless' titans and humans all seem to be related could be a reference to that. 

-Alternatively, the concept of titan-shifting could be a reference to the berserkers: in Norse mythology, 'berserk' means 'to change shape or form'; the berserkers were the warriors of the god Odin, and the most feared warriors in the world. This is because they would enter some kind of trance-like state before going to battle, which would increase their strength and endurance, make them immune to steel and fire and drive them insane in such a way that they would not stop fighting until they had killed everything in their path or were killed themselves.




 








 

 




 -A new monster found exclusively in ocean biomes (guardians don't count, they're generated structure-specific).

-A new block/resource found exclusively on and under ocean floors; maybe some kind of underwater flower (like algae) would be nice.

-More biome diversity using the biomes that we currently have.

-Smarter villagers and a new GUI that allows to view and interact with the villagers' inventory.

-More uses for the rare fish items that you can get from fishing and from killing guardians (clownfish, raw salmon and pufferfish); and fyi I know that they already have uses, but it's not enough. 

-The ability to choose which painting we get, at least in creative.

-A recipe to craft sponges, so you have the choice to not have to explore in order to get more of them if you don't want to

-A use for the Enderdragon egg

-A silverfish-exclusive drop, so they aren't entirely useless

-A recipe to craft End stone



 




 Am I the only one who thinks this?  




 1. The Enderdragon can be pushed around with pistons
2. The Wither can see players who are under the effect of an invisibility potion
3. You can hide light by placing a torch on the same block as an armor stand and then placing armor pieces on the armor stand
4. Both the Elder Guardian's Mining Fatigue effects and the effect provided by beacons are interdimensional
5. You can literally make floating grass and flowers by removing the block on which they are placed with the use of a 3rd party editor such as MCedit
6. You can place ghasts in minecarts and use them to push other mobs around
7. The gap between a fence gate and a cobblestone wall can be passed through by the Player, but not by other mobs
8. If you place an upside down slab next to a light block (such as glowstone), it will block light completely just like a full block
9. Dark oak wood fences do not burn
10. You can create a 'half-banner' by placing it directly above a full block

Remember the guy from the Zipkrowd server who managed to make an XP farm using the Enderdragon? When the dragon dies, he takes 10 seconds to fully despawn and turn into an End portal. During those 10 seconds, experience orbs also 'come out' of his body and drop on the ground. But when you unload the chunk in which this process is happening before it is completed, the game 'forgets' about the process happening in that chunk and repeats it everytime you load the chunk again. This results in what is by far the fastest XP farm in the game.

It was previously believed that this only works with experience orbs, but in the video that I linked, someone managed to apply what I call the 'chunk-duplication principle' to diamonds, showing that it possibly works with all items and entities. I don't know if this was intended or not, but this effectively makes all items renewable, including diamonds, as you can see in this video. 

This is not technically a 'farm', as items are duplicated rather than created, but in the end the outcome is the same: you can go afk and effortlessly get diamonds. 

 














 Either Rod is a lying piece of scum, or RBA, Eren's father and Kenny were all hasty ignorant fools. 

All of them went to such great lengths to acquire the 'Reiss power', not knowing that it can only be used by people from the Reiss bloodline? RBA wasted half a decade of their lives and indirectly killed thousands of people just to acquire that power, without knowing that? Eren's father gave his own life to give that power to Eren, without knowing that it could only be used by the Reiss? 

I refuse to believe it. I'm sure it's not everyone that can fully use that power, but I would also be extremely surprised if it was ONLY the Reiss people who can do so. Grisha MIGHT've been a fool who didn't know, but I'm sure RBA knew that they couldn't use it themselves... that's why they wanted to bring Eren along instead of just eating him and taking the power for themselves. Furthermore, in chapter 50 Reiner and Berthold looked like they had seen that power being used before. So, unless the Reiss have relatives who live outside the walls, there's no way Rod is telling the truth. 

Also, in Norse mythology, the giant who builds the walls of Asgard doesn't do it just to 'give peace to humanity'. There has to be a whole lot more to this story than just what Rod tells Historia.  









 We now know that, 100 years ago, the walls were made by a titan who, Rod says, wanted 'to give peace to humanity'. However, is this what really happened? It seems now that the story of SnK is a re-telling on some of the Norse stories, at least metaphorically. 

The 'titan building the walls' concept refers to the disguised hrimthurs (frost giant) who built the walls of Asgard, the kingdom of the Aesir gods, in exchange for Freya, the Vanir goddess, and the moon and the sun. The gods accepted the bargain, because they never thought he would succeed in 3 seasons, which was one of the conditions of that bargain. However, thanks to Loki's influence, the frost giant was also allowed to use the giant stallion, Svailfari. Because of this, he was going to succeed, and when the gods realized that, they told Loki to stop the builder of the walls or else they would kill the former, blaming him for the latter's success. So, when the walls were nearly finished being built, Loki turned into a mare, and charmed the stallion, taking him away from his duty. From this, the walls weren't finished in time, and also, from the union between Loki and the stallion, a eight-legged horse named Sleipnir was born.  Shortly after this, the gods found out that the disguised builder was in fact a frost giant, and the god Thor brutally murdered him. 

Based on this, I think that, the truth is, the titan who created the walls and the 'crystal cave' asked for something in exchange for doing so, and that it wasn't just 'to give peace to humanity'. However, just like in the Norse mythology, the people who asked for that titan's help didn't respect their end of the deal, and then killed him. This is a very well known story in Norse mythology, and different versions of the same story are also found in other European cultures. So, based on the fact that there are already striking similarities with that story in SnK, I would doubt that this isn't what Isayama based himself on for the 'titan building the walls' story.

Also, here's my opinion after reading 64:

I hated how, as usual, the little pieces of information that we were given just lead to either the same questions or new ones. I did like Hanji's thought that the cave 'couldn't be man-made'. Indeed. However, I did enjoy all the action and seeing Kenny. I can't wait for Isayama to get into the details of his 'dream'. Also, poor Hanji. :(  




 In short, there is simply too much of a gap between the manga and the animated versions. Because of this, the community cannot and will not be one.

When the people who only know the animated version think 'Attack on Titans', they think dumb, scary-looking giants that eat humans. It's probably a little more than that for some people, but I'm overly dumbing it down to make a point.

Personally, I have read and re-read every single piece of canon material countless times, I have spent countless hours writing on and thinking about the story. I also have read extensively on Norse mythology, from which Isayama draws much of his inspiration. Because of this, I simply cannot have the same perspective as 'anime-only people'. I mean, I could put myself in those people's shoes, but it just doesn't feel right... It feels like a different story, so instead I choose to not discuss SnK with those people, because it ruins everything that SnK is for me.

When anime-only people think Attack on Titan, they think titans that eat people. But when I think Attack on Titan, first of all, I don't even think 'titans', as for me titans aren't titans, but rather, an isomorphic representation of the result of of a highly complex network of interconnected sociopolitical structures; the 'titans' are merely the literary 'recipient' used to portray the metaphor associated to that representation. I see moral imperative conflicts, oligarchism, the sociopolitical dimension of spirituality and technology and technological progress, etc. I see a story that takes place in a society with a history of conflicts and other types of interaction between groups that are based on common beliefs and purposes, bloodline, and perhaps other things as well. But to think that some people think of SnK as just 'a story about titans that eat people' saddens me, and yet at the same time I can't blame those people, because, based on how far the animated version is at the moment, there isn't much room for thinking beyond that. But like I said, it ruins the excitement that I get from SnK to hear those people's opinions, so I choose to avoid discussing with them about SnK altogether.

Some people will probably disagree, but basically, I believe that because of the huge gap between the manga and anime versions, each version is basically a different story and as long as the gap remains this big, we can never be a unified community. At least not without some effort from the manga folks to 'dumb down' their own perspective of the story to fit that of most anime-only people, which I personally refuse to do. 





 














 Well, Reiner did ask this question to Ymir.

So, what do you guys think?

Does the world in which the main characters live have a future?  




 I am guy. Pretty sure I like girls. I know, because I've been surrounded by girls all my life. Growing up my father was away for work most of the time, so the parent that took care of me was my mom. I have four sisters. Also, I have some guy acquaintances, but all of my good and best friends are girl. I have literally no male friends. In college, my faculty has 1154 students, 90% of which are girls. I am surrounded by relatively pretty and intelligent girls everywhere, 100% of the time.

And yet, I've never had a girlfriend, or any intimate relationship with a girl. I've never even kissed a girl outside of in a party context where everyone was wasted. Obviously I've had some intimate physical contacts with some of my female friends, but I've never touched the opposite sex's intimate parts.

When I was young, I thought that it was because of my physical appearance. So I started training really hard. But it's been 5 years now, I take care of my appearance and I'm pretty buff (all my friends keep telling me), and yet nothing has changed. I'm 20 year old, and by now I've figured out that it's obviously not about my physical appearance, but what is it? What is it that's wrong with me? I am surrounded by hundreds of girls, and yet I can't get any of them to like me as more than a friend. A lot of them say that I'm good looking, a lot of them say that I'm intelligent, almost all of them say that I'm a nice guy (I try really hard to be a genuinely nice human being), and yet not a single one of them has ever entertained the thought of having me as a boyfriend. Why?  




 I teach at a elementary school, and this year one of my kids is a boy named Ymir. His father comes to pick him up everyday. He told me the name comes from Norse mythology, the stories of which he's a big fan. No surprise here. I almost asked him the other day if he knows about Attack on Titan, but I felt it would be a little inappropriate lol. Now it bugs me big time, everyday I think of asking him. Should I?  









 As you guys saw, Frieda erased Historia's memories, but when Historia touched Eren (who took Frieda's memories through his father), she got those memories back.

Well, one of the laws of our world is that nothing truly 'disappears', things always change form or go somewhere else. What if, the way the power works, the user simply 'steals' the person' memories and keeps it within him/herself?

Now, we know that the memories of the entire population within the walls were taken away. I would assume that if a single person had so many memories, it would drive them crazy or something bad would happen. So what if, instead, the monarchy has been using the Wall Titans as 'memory vessels' that hold all the memories of the people within the walls?

And if people were to touch these titans, or the human within them (if there is one), they would retrieve all the memories that were taken away, and that is why the monarchy doesn't want anyone to know about those titans?

That's just another theory that I had, based on the idea that nothing truly disappears, and those memories must go somewhere when they are forgotten by the person. 

What do you guys think?  




 I used mostly what I know about Norse mythology (on which SnK seems to be almost entirely based, at least metaphorically), and this: http://calorescence.tumblr.com/post/51450703198/did-you-know-the-inside-covers-of-the-japanese

I believe the story of SnK takes place in a post-apocalyptic Norse mythology-influenced world. 

In the SnK universe, humans have been around for a lot longer than 2000 years. However, 2000 years ago, some kind of Titan-like being appeared. I don't know how, or why, or what he was exactly, but let's call him 'the original titan'. His name was Ymir, and he had three titan children. Two of them had children of their own together, and were the first of the 'true titans' to live. The third one mated with a human, and the children born out this union became the first generation of titan-human hybrids, that is, people who have the physical appearance of humans, but possess the powers of the true titans.

At some point after that, I'm not sure exactly why, but the titan-human hybrids killed Ymir and used his power for themselves. This started the age-old feud between true titans and titan-human hybrids.. This feud ultimately culminated in a great battle between the two. This great battle happened 2000 years after the death of Ymir, and  100 years before the start of the story. And 'To you, 2000 Years From Now' means that, 2000 years after his death and after the great battle between titans and hybrids, Ymir was reborn into a human. 



The hybrids lost the war, and most of them were decimated. After the war, the surviving hybrids and humans sailed to a new world. During the war, the humans had mostly been collateral damage, being used by the true titans, who turned them into mindless titans that were capapble of killing the hybrids and stealing their titan power in the process. This continued being a problem after the war, so, to protect the humans, the hybrids used their titan powers to build great walls that would protect the remaining humans from their fellow humans who had been turned by the true titans during the war.

Even though the humans and hybrids look the same, and now live together as well, they are by no means the same. The noble families, who rule, are the descendants of the hybrids who survived the war; the 'titan nature' runs through their veins. And the rest of the people are mere humans, which is why they are looked down upon and controlled by these noble families. This is what the noble being tortured by Zackley meant, when he said that their flesh and blood are not the same.

And the other conflicts within the story are merely internal conflicts between the hybrids. The Ackerman were probably another lineage of the hybrids, until the Reiss lineage erased their memories and chased them out. I'm not sure who RBA's people is, but they are very similar to the Vanir in Norse mythology. The Vanir were a branch of the hybrids who descend from Ymir that I talk about in my text. Some of them possessed magical powers, they kept the location of their village a secret, and once sent three of their people to live in Asgard as part of a truce between them and another branch of gods who lived there, the Aesir. One of these three people was a goddess named Freia. In chapter 50, Reiner states that they must 'retrieve' Frieda's power, implying that it once belonged to his people. 

 




 In Norse mythology (on which SnK is based), Ymir is the giant from which the first gods and other giants are born. Then the third generation of gods kill Ymir and use his body to make the world, giving birth to humans and a bunch of other races.

Now I understand that, in SnK, Ymir isn't necessarily associated to the birth of everything (it's unlikely that the world of SnK is only a century old), so maybe she's related to the birth of titans or the titan power or something like that.

But there is nothing, absolutely nothing in Norse mythology that ever mentions Ymir coming back to life in any shape or form. So I'm trying to figure out where Isayama took that from. Any ideas? 

  




 I've been re-reading the chapters that involve the Beast Titan (aka Skrymir/Utgard-Loki from Norse mythology), and I've noticed one particular difference between their two powers that I feel is really important.

Skrymir doesn't have to do anything to control the Titans. And not only does he seem to control them, but more disturbingly, they seem to be aware of his existence. It's like they just know he's there, and, unlike all the other beings that we have seen so far, normal humans and titan shifters alike, they don't see him as someone that they should 'eat'. 

On the other hand, Eren was seen as a perfectly normal human being and titan-shifter, except for that brief moment in which he used his Screaming ability out of despair. 

I wonder if it's because their powers are two different ones, or because Skrymir's power is the same as Eren's, but 'turned on' permanently? Or perhaps it has to do with the fact that he 'made' those titans? Reiner told Ymir in chapter 46, if I'm not mistaken, that there was something different about those titans, that they could still move at night unlike the other mindless titans. And Reiner knew that those titans were Connie's village's people that had been turned by Skrymir.

I wonder if Skrymir can not only make his own titans, but if, when he does, they also take his orders and have characteristics that the mindless titan that we're used to doesn't have, such as the ability to still move around at night?  




 I feel like this is the most important and biggest question of the story. 

Is the 'mindless' titan a failed or dumbed down of the titan shifter, or is the titan shifter an improved version of the 'mindless' titan? Or are both transformations two 'variants' of the same power? 

The story has been pretty vague about titan history so far. We know that, over a hundred years ago, humanity was 'unable to match the overwhelming force of the titans', and so they made the walls on a new continent and then left there by boat. 

Personally, I believe that the 'mindless' titan came after the titan shifter, and here's why.

Firstly, I don't think 'mindless' titans are actually mindless. They were made to only be aware of/listen to those with powers like the Coordinate's, and otherwise wander about in a seemingly mindless manner.

Secondly, I think that the fact that mindless titans try to eat humans is part of a set of encoded or pre-programmed behaviors that come along with being a mindless titan. If they eat someone who is a shifter, they can go back to their human form. 

Finally, I believe Hanji's 'fusion' theory is true. When you become a titan, you fuse with some kind of material or entity, and mindless titans are simply the result of fusing completely with that material or entity.

I think that the titan power was initially some kind of weapon used in war: when soldiers become wounded, they turn into an 'empowered version of themselves' and can wreck havoc. But then someone else, who had a power like the Coordinate's, turned that weapon against its creator and made it suit their own abilities. 

What do you guys think? 


 




 -Frieda Reiss: based on Freyja, a Vanir goddess who practiced the art of Seir, a form of sorcery that allows the user to alter the course of destiny.

-Ymir: based on Ymir, a hermaphroditic jtunn (giant) who is the progenitor of all jtnar. The two first giants were literally made from the body of Ymir.

-Castle Utgard: a major stronghold in Jotunheim, one of the nine worlds of Yggdrasir and the world of the frost and rock jtnar.

-Grisha Yaeger: his titan's physical appearance and actions throughout the SnK story closely resemble that of Surtur, a fire jtnar. In the events of Ragnark, a major battle in Old Norse mythology, Surtur fought and killed many important Norse gods, most importantly Freyr, the twin brother of Freyja. At the end of the war, he used his blazing sword to literally 'engulf the world in flames'.

Tell me if I'm missing any.   














 Originally, there were two gifted peoples with extraordinary abilities. One was a highly intelligent and magical people, of which the members could control people's minds and manipulate their memories in order to change their past or give them a new vision of the future. The other people was one with incredible physical abilities; their strength and dexterity were superhuman, and they could move just about any object, or complete certain tasks faster than anyone else. At first, those two people were travelling the world freely, helping people and making their dreams come true. However, eventually, the people who ruled became jealous of these people and started asking them to serve them and to do their biding. When these two peoples each refused, the rulers became mad, and ordered that they be captured or killed. They fought back, and most of them were killed. The few of them that remained were enslaved, and people started fighting for their possession. When the war had already been going on for decades, someone made the titan power. That person had grown tired of the endless warring, and came to the conclusion that humanity would never stop fighting, unless all humans were either turned into mindless titans or killed by those titans. Basically, that person's goal was to eradicate all humans using the titan power that they created.

When people started being turned into titans in large numbers and things became chaotic, the only ones to be able to survive were the two gifted peoples, using their abilities. Eventually, those gifted peoples came together and, in order to keep surviving, found a way to combine their respective power with the titan's. The ''magical'' people acquired the ability to control the mindless titans by accessing the memories buried deep within what's left of the human body within the titan, and the ''physical'' people became the titan-shifters, i.e., people who could enhance their already above average physical abilities by turning into a titan that has these abilities. In order to eventually free members of their peoples who had been turned into mindless titans, they also made it so that a mindless titan could regain his human form by eating someone who had acquired that titan-related power, so that, when a person got too sick or old, they could be eaten and allow someone else to regain their human form and therefore relive the lifetime that they had lost by being turned into a mindless titan.

After that, those two peoples came together with the normal people who hadn't been turned into titans, and they formed the humanity that used to live in the old world. However, people kept being turned into mindless titans despite their efforts to protect them, and eventually, they decided that the only option was to leave for a new continent that they had discovered. There, they combined the powers of the two peoples in order to create huge walls that would protect people from the ''titan plague''. Some of the most gifted members of the people with the incredible physical abilities were, with the use of the titan power, turned into enormous titans that could harden themselves to make walls, and then the most gifted members of the people with the mind-powers used those powers to order them to build the walls... Yes, because these people had to be ''mindless', otherwise they would age and not be able to protect humanity forever. On the other hand, for the people with the mind-powers, the task at hand put such a strain on their body that they died creating the walls, and this is why these walls were named in their honor.
In the present day, some of the descendants of these two peoples are the Ackerman, of the ''physical'' people, and the Reiss, of the ''magical'' people. 

Some decades ago, the two peoples started disagreeing on a lot of things, and as a result, the magical people starting plotting against the members of the physical people, in order to get rid of them. Eventually, they succeeded in chasing them away, and all of them either left the walls or stayed and had their memories erased, so as to even forget that they used to rule within the walls and have a special power. Some of those who had left the walls were eventually eaten and their power was taken by people who weren't from their people (RBA). The only member of the physical people who still lives within the walls and didn't have his mind wiped is Kenny, because he knew Rod personally and swore allegiance to him in exchange for being spared.

And that is the true story of humanity. 




 What if the reason he never takes the power for himself is that the person who has the power must always be eaten by another person at some point so that the power can continuously be passed from one generation to the next? What if the power is lost if the holder dies without passing the power to anyone?

Also, what if Rod Reiss is the one to pass down the knowledge of how the power works? To tell the new users how to use it? 

  




 'Who actually wants to kill people?'

I think if Grisha did what he did, it's because the Reiss must have done terrible things. 

I don't think he would have brutally murdered 5 children just like that, and it must have been his last resort, so to speak.

Anyone else think that Rod is leaving out a big chunk of the story?  




 As you guys all know, the titan-shifter transformation is triggered through wounding. The human blood is mostly made up of red and white blood cells, the latter of which contain a cell necleus that, in turn, is made up of DNA sequences. When wounding occurs, it damages a layer of cells known as vascular endothelial cells, situated in the body's blood vessels and which are in direct contact with blood cells known as thrombocytes, of which the function is to stop bleeding. This process is called primary hemostatis, and results in the area of the wound repairing itself through complex interactions between the blood cells (thrombocytes) and other things in the endothelium (the area where the endothelial cells are in the blood vessel). My theory is that, in titan-shifters, when wounding occurs, the thrombocytes not only repair the endothelial cells, they also cause them to send a signal to the white blood cells, which, because their nucleus has been modified with whatever the titan power is, also trigger the titan transformation.

Things that make me believe the titan power is based on genome modifications:

-While all titans have regenerative capacities in their human form and the ability to switch between human and titan, their titan-shifter transformation's physical characteristics vary from an individual to another. In humans, the genome is what determines physical appearance, and the titan's physical appearance could simply be a distorted expression of the human's genome.

-It's been highly implied that the abilities one gets from the titan power are based on heredity

-Like I explained in detail, the titan-transformation seems to be triggered by something in the individual's blood cells.

What do you guys think? 









 The two great questions that we cannot answer are: 'What exactly is a titan?' and 'How did the titans first appear?' However, what we can say is that there seems to be two variations of what are called 'titans': the human who is stuck in his titan form and who cannot control his actions (the mindless titan); and the human who can switch back and forth between titan and human, who has regenerative characteristics in his human form, and who has distinct physical characteristics and abilities in his titan form (the titan-shifter).  In other words, the first variation has the purpose, or at least the indirect consequence, of either rendering the human being useless or making him dangerous in unpredictable ways or both; on the other hand, the second variation simply empowers the individual. However, the two variations have one thing in common: they are based on heredity. Also, because the titan-power is based on heredity, then the importance or value of one's bloodline is based on, not only the importance or value of the titan-power associated to that bloodline, but also on whether that bloodline has inherited any special titan power at all.

Family name is usually associated with heredity. In the real world, people who share a family name usually have a relatively recent common ancestor. In Shingeki no Kyojin, there are multiple examples of people who have a heredity-based titan power. Firstly, all those with the Ackerman family name possess a power popularly known as 'the Awakening', which causes the user to experience a sudden burst of power at a moment of grave danger (in other words, an environmental trigger), and then to be overall more powerful physically from this moment onwards. Secondly, in chapter 63 of the manga, Rod Reiss referred to his daughter Frieda's power, popularly known as 'the Mind-Wipe Power', as a 'Reiss power', strongly suggesting that only people from the Reiss bloodline  can inherit or use this power. Finally, when Eren received Frieda's power through eating his father, he received an ability that has been referred to by some of the story's characters as 'the Screaming'. This suggests that, when Eren received the titan-shifter's power, he didn't receive the Mind-Wipe Power, but rather, a power associated to his own bloodline. In conclusion, everyone can possess the titan-shifter's power, but the abilities that the power grants to the person are based on heredity. 

Another example of the titan-power being heredity-based is the so-called noble families that live within the walls. According to Erwin, when interrogated by Darius Zackley's men, the members of the noble families implied that they couldn't be mind-wiped because of their noble blood. It is known that the noble families have been using the Reiss bloodline's Mind-Wipe Power to alter the memories of the people living within the walls. Based on the premise that, when used, the power alters the minds of everyone within a given area, it is safe to assume that, for purely practical reasons, those who are in charge of the society within the walls would have to be immune to the Mind-Wipe Power. Therefore, one possibility is that those who are deemed 'noble' within the walls are deemed as such because their hereditary power either counters or prevents the effects of the Mind-Wipe Power. This also reinforces the idea that the importance of one's bloodline in Shingeki no Kyojin is based on the type of titan-power that said bloodline has inherited. 

Ymir is a character who illustrates the idea that, not only are the special abilities granted by the titan-power based on heredity, but also that some people have not inherited any special power.  From the time that she was a mindless titan (which we see in Reiner's flashback or when she ate the former's presumably titan-shifter friend, Berik) to the time that we see her as a titan-shifter, she remains seemingly physically unchanged. When she ate Berik, she received the ability to switch back and forth between human and titan, as well as the regenerative characteristics in her human form and which all titan-shifters seem to possess. However, she didn't inherit neither his titan's physical characteristics nor any special titan-related power that he might have had. This suggests two things: firstly, that, while the abilities to regenerate one's human body parts and to switch back and forth between both forms are common to all titan-shifters, things like the general physical characteristics and special power are based one's genome; and secondly, that some people's bloodline might not have inherited any special titan-power, which explains why her titan was still a 'regular' one after becoming a titan-shifter.

In conclusion, there are two types of titan: the mindless titan and the titan-shifter. While all titan-shifters can regenerate their human body and switch back and forth between their human and titan forms, one's titan's general physical appearance and special power are based on that person's genome. This would explain why the process of turning into a titan is triggered through wounding: the human blood is made up mostly of red and white cells, which contain a cell nucleus with DNA sequences in it; DNA, of which the human genome is made, is what defines physical characteristics in the real world. However, many questions are still left answered besides the two most important ones asked at the start of this essay. How and from which part of the human body is the titan transformation itself triggered? And, more importantly, which of the parts of the human body that are involved in the titan-transformation (if there is more than one) is/are responsible for the differences between mindless titans and titan-shifters? In other words, what makes it so that mindless titans are, in fact, 'mindless', while titan-shifters can still control their body? These questions might become partly answerable when more information is given about the functioning of the process that allows the titan-shifter's power to be transferred through a mindless titan 'eating' parts of a titan-shifter's body. 







 




 I think Grisha was originally just like RBA: he came from somewhere outside the walls, infiltrated the society within these walls and had the loose goal of retrieving the Titan power that allows the user to control people and of exterminating all the people there, who he saw as the enemy of his own people. However, at some point he realized that the real enemy was the noble families, who had the power he was looking for, and that the people within the walls were innocent, merely being controlled and kept in ignorance by those noble families.  He also correctly guessed that there would eventually be other people just like him (RBA) who would come to try and do the same thing. So, when he discovered who among the noble families had the power to control people, he went to them, explained them the situation, and then asked them to either give him the power or use it to protect the people or something like that, but they refused (perhaps because they didn't believe him when he said that people like RBA would come and try to kill everyone). Because of that, he decided that,  in order to stop what he saw as wrong (the noble families controlling the people but not doing anything to protect them), he had to not only take the power by force, but also to make sure that the Reiss would never have that power again. That's why he tried to kill all of them: to end the Reiss bloodline.

After he had taken the power from the Reiss, two things happened. Firstly, he found out that he had been too late to act, as RBA had already invaded and caused the death of thousands, including his wife. Secondly, I don't know how he found that out or why it's like this, but he discovered that, even though he had Frieda's power, he couldn't use it, but that Eren could. So he turned Eren into a titan with that serum and then made him eat him, thereby acquiring that power.

And that's probably what Grisha meant by 'You will be the one to avenge your mother': because the noble families were selfish and kept everyone ignorant, all those innocent people died... Eren's mother died. And Grisha wants Eren to use the power to kill them all, or at least to somehow stop this huge lie that the noble families created with the society within these walls.  









 What happens if an oriental, someone like Levi and Mikasa, gets the Reiss bloodline power? Do they technically become some kind of super powerful being?

What if that's what Grisha was trying to accomplish? Eren is half-oriental through his mom (maybe?), and now he also has the Reiss bloodline power, making him super powerful.  









 Isayama said that he would start answering questions, but literally 90% of what he did was telling us what we already know:

Pixis is the good guy;
Zackley is an evil motherfucker who had it planned all along;
The Ackerman have some kind of special power because of which they were discriminated;
Frida could have been the real deal, but Grisha ate the f*ck out of her, and then he killed everyone else;
Frida's power has to do with control/possession of memories.

I'm sorry, but personally, that was obvious to me a long time ago already. Some of this since chapter 62, and a lot of this stuff since even before that. Can't believe I had to wait a month for this ****. And now I have to wait another 60 days (yes, next month is a break) to be told even more stuff that I probably already more or less know? 

Fuck off. Good luck, Isayama. I'm sure all the brain-dead anime only watchers will make you a load of money when season 2 comes out. Meanwhile, all the decent people who read your story will have to wait  for years before seeing it actually unfold. But I won't be one of them.  




 Hey guys, I recently started my own skyblock-like survival single player world, by making a customized superflat world with nothing but air in it and then adding the first block using a command.

However, now I'm having an issue. Basically when I get into the Nether, it isn't empty like the Overworld, it's just a regular survival world Nether. I'm wondering if there is a way to make it completely empty of blocks like my overworld?

Thanks in advance.  









 Am I the only one who noticed how obvious Isayama was being about this, in the last chapter?

It should be obvious to everyone who read chapter 62 that her main reason for going to the village was to see Historia who, back then, lived on a nearby farm, and that being nice to the villagers was just a cover-up. No?  




 I just thought of something crazy. What if the people within the walls have all something within their body that makes it easier for them to be turned into titans and used as a weapon? We know that a lot of people had their minds wiped in the past. What if, once someone with a coordinate's power has used his powers on someone by connecting to a certain part of their brain, it becomes possible for others with a similar special power to turn them into titans? What if that's how MT was able to turn the people from Connie's village into titans? Even crazier, what if that's what meant when it was said that Grisha saved a bunch of people from a plague? What if he had 'cured' a lot of people by reverting that change in their brain as a part of an experiment to better understand how titans work? 

Maybe that would also explain why RBA wanted to slaughter everyone: they were afraid that, otherwise, all of the people within the walls would eventually be used to attack their village. 

Just some late night thoughts I had. Maybe I'm completely wrong and this is too far-stretched lol.  




 I'll make it short, I've written about this before, but I wanted to make it more formal by making a post about it. I think the room under the chapel (where Eren is being held atm) and the room under Eren's house are both the same thing: some kind of 'control room'. I can't tell how many of these there are, but I think that the walls connect to these rooms from under the ground. When in this 'control room', the coordinate's power is particularly powerful, that's why Rod and Historia could trigger Eren's memories just by touching him near his spine. It's also from one of these rooms that users of the coordinate's power ordered the titans to create the walls, and from which they used their power to wipe the minds of the entire population within the walls a century prior to the start of the story. Grisha was probably going to bring Eren in that room under their basement once Eren had acquired the coordinate's power, and wanted to carry out a plan of his own with that power, but something didn't go as planned.

Also, a theory on why RBA want the coordinate's power. First, titans aren't exactly 'mindless'. They're made to only listen to those who have the coordinate's power. That's why it's called the 'coordinate' by Reiner, because the holder can 'coordinate' titans who otherwise wander in a seemingly mindless manner, trying to eat humans as part of a set of 'hardwired' or pre-programmed behaviors that comes along with being a titan.

When humanity still lived in the old world, someone started turning everyone into titans, and humanity was overwhelmed by the sheer number of titans. So the monarchy left with a few people and left the others to die to titans. However, a few managed to survive somehow... This was RBA's people. Having the coordinate's power would allow them to save what remains of their people and reclaim the land.  

Let me know what you guys think, if this makes sense, if you think I'm right, etc. 














 I believe that, at least a hundred years prior to the start of the story, some people were transformed into the titans that make up the walls right now, with the ability to manipulate the physical matter that consistutes their very being (the titan-like body) in various ways. However, they had to be 'mindless'; this is very important, because like we've seen with Ymir, when 'mindless', the human somewhere within the titan doesn't age physically and can therefore live on as long as he/she is in that state/form.

However, I believe 'mindless' is the wrong term. Titans were made so that they will only listen to/be aware of the existence of the people who possess what Reiner called the 'Coordinate', and will otherwise wander about in a seemingly mindless manner, eating human beings as part of a set of pre-programmed behaviors. Basically, those people can 'coordinate' the titans to do certain things. This excludes titan-shifters, for which I have another theory that I won't discuss here. 

Back to my theory of what happened, the strange room below the Reiss chapel is a 'control room' to which the wall titans are connected. I believe that there are 3 rooms like that, one for every wall, and that another one is what Grisha's basement is. This is why the walls seem to expand underground, because the physical matter that makes up the walls connects the titans to these rooms. This connection not only allows those who possess the coordinate's power to control all the wall titans from those rooms, but also gives them a massive quantity of energy that they can use to use their abilities on a much larger scale than normally, like for wiping out the memories of an entire population. This is why Rod and Historia can trigger Eren's memories just by touching him when he is in that room - because the massive amount of energy coming from the walls makes Eren's abilities particularly powerful.  

However, using the coordinate's power on a large scale puts a lot of strain on the body and can therefore be deadly for its users. The 3 women who wiped out the memories of an entire population probably died doing so, and this is why the walls were named in their honor, because of their noble sacrifice. Regardless, if they were able to do such a thing, I would assume that a single user of the coordinate's power using his abilities to maximum efficiency in one of those control rooms would be able to do something big. I think Grisha wanted to use Eren to carry out that 'something big', and it was something so big that the user would have died in the process, and that's why he couldn't do it himself. He was probably going to get Eren to have the coordinate power, bring him to that room (the basement) and have him use his powers to carry out his own plans. But obviously something went wrong, but that was his original plan.  




 ...that the RBA invasion took place on the same day as Grisha's attack on the Reiss family at the chapel.

I'm not saying that RBA and Grisha are related, or even that RBA, Grisha and the Reiss family are all related, although RBA want the Coordinate's power, which Eren now possesses, and which the Reiss family at least used to possess. So I'd say there's a good chance that this is what links them all. 

In all cases, I doubt Isayama would make those two incredibly important events take place on the same day just to troll us. I think that, whatever business the Reiss were doing below that chapel on that day, both Grisha and RBA knew precisely that it was going to happen on that day and that's why they both chose that day in particular to make their move. Perhaps it has to do with something having to happen every x amount of days. Who knows.

But my point is, it sure as hell isn't a coincidence. 

 









 In the Japanese text that they show in the animate, it is said that the monarchy fled the old world because humanity was unable to match the Titans. Yet it also says that the monarchy used the Titan's power to make the walls on the new continent. So, basically, they could control enormous Titan-shifters to make huge walls, but they couldn't control these Titans to fight off the Titans themselves?

Isn't that contradictory?  




 http://mangafox.me/manga/shingeki_no_kyojin/v12/c047/16.html

What exactly is Berthold referring to, when he says that to Ymir?  




 Isayama said in an interview, a while ago, that by the time the story ends, Armin and Eren wouldn't be friends anymore.

Given what we know now, do you guys think we're in a better position to explain what might be the reasons for that? Basically, what will cause them to not be friends anymore in the future?  




 If Grisha was already a shifter when he attacked the Reiss family, then who did he eat to become one? 

The only people who come from within the walls and who can turn into titans seem to be the members of the Reiss family, one of whom Eren got his titan-shifting powers from. 

Does that mean Grisha came from outside the walls just like Ymir and RBA? 
 









 In the anime, it is stated that, a long time ago, humanity was plagued by a war that had caused the death of most people already when the Titans appeared and humanity, severely weakened, was unable to fight them. Then the monarchy made giant walls on a new continent and a small group made up of the richest and most powerful left on that new continent to escape the Titans.

What do you guys think this war was(or is if it's still going on) about?

Also, an interesting thing to note... The monarchy could use the Titans to make walls, but not to fight off the Titans themselves? Sounds like a contradiction to me.  




 ...is just really hairy as a human?

I know it sounds dumb, but Berthold sweats a lot, and his Titan is all about releasing hot steam.

What if Monkey Trouble simply has a lot of body hair as a human?

Everyone's going crazy with these theories about how he's a true Titan and the original Titan that started it all and all that whacky stuff, but I think he's just a Titan-shifter with some Coordinate-like power and who happens to be really, really hairy as a human.

Am I the only one? 




 Basically, on that day, this is what happens:

-While RBA are invading the walls, Grisha is on his way to the only freaking chapel of its kind within the walls where Rod Reiss and all of his kids (except Historia) are supposedly praying because of said invasion.

-We don't know exactly what happens once he gets there, but it ends in a bloodbath: Grisha slaughters and eats everyone except Rod Reiss. 

-At some point after (not necessarly on the same day), again, we don't know exactly what happens, but Eren turns into a mindless titan and eats his father, becoming a titan-shifter and acquiring the Reiss children's memories in the process. 

And THAT'S IT. All the rest is speculation at this point. If the goal of this chapter was to tell us what went down that day without going into the specifics of how titans work, I'd say it's mission accomplished.

Also, we can make some conclusions out of this anyway:

-Grisha must have had one hell of a burden on his shoulder, because no one starts murdering defenseless children unless they've gone fucking hopeless;

-Eren is screwed, period;

-Erwin's question 'why is Historia so freaking important?' has been partially answered: she is the last living Reiss child;

-It's no coincidence that the RBA invasion and that the chapel massacre went down on the same day, from a literary perspective. So RBA   friends and Grisha are definitly linked somehow;

-Grisha knew the Reiss family and what they were about. We don't know how much he knew about them, or whether he knew any of them personally, but he was definitly aware of their existence and he had definitly seen them before. 

 




 I mean, regardless of what his reasons were... Is there really anything that justifies slaughtering a bunch of children?

It's true that RBA caused the death of a lot of people, but they were brainwashed kids, so I can't really blame them.

On the other hand, Grisha was a fully grown up adult who perfectly undersood the implications of his actions. 

What do you guys think?  




 ***Over 107 years ago, before year 738***: 

-There are some serious and perhaps intentional controversies. It is stated that humanity used to live on another continent in a war-torn world when the titans appeared and it was unable to fight them off. As a result, a small group made up of humanity's richest and most powerful decided to leave to a new continent where huge walls which would serve to protect humanity had already been made. Their goal was to create a world 'free of sins, eternally without strife'. The trip was rough, and only half the boats made it. However, if humanity already possessed a power that allows its users to control titans (and which was used to make the walls themselves) on a seemingly large scale, then how was it unable to 'match the overwhelming force of the titans'? 

-Some time after that, the Coordinate's power is used to wipe the memories of the first generation of people living within the walls, so that no one can remember what happened before and society can start anew, free of titan-related knowledge. 


***Year 770***: 

-Angel Altonen, a weaponsmith, creates the first version of the 3DM.

gear. 

-A 'child of titan' is born. A mother gets eaten, and then regurgitated by a titan who spits her body over the wall after eating her alive. Inside her belly, a living baby is found. 


***Year 773***: 

-Ymir is born, somewhere outside the walls. 


***Year 785***: 

-A large number of people, including Ymir, are turned into mindless titans. 


***At some point between 785 and 844***:

-Reiner, Berthold, Annie, Marcel, and possibly other people are turned into mindless titans, but then somehow become titan-shifters by presumably eating other titan-shifters. 

-Frida, Historia's sister, visits her at the farm where she lives. She teaches her how to be educated as well as, presumably, how to use the Coordinate's power. However, on their last meeting, she makes her forget everything she taught her until they can meet again. 

***Year 844***

-Mikasa's parents are slaughtered by thieves, but Mikasa herself is saved by Eren and his father. Eren's father adopts her as his child and takes her in with his family. 

-Ilse Langner, the last survivor of a Survey Corps expedition outside the walls, encounters a titan who mistakes her for Ymir, and then eats her alive and burries her. The titan is seen crying over her lifeless corpse, and the events are recorded by Ilse in her notebook before her death. The notebook is found in year 845, by Levi and Hange. 


***Year 845***:



-Reiner, Berthold, Annie and Marcel are on their way to infiltrate and destroy humanity, and to retrieve the Coordinate's power. On their way, they encounter Ymir, who somehow eats Marcel and becomes a titan-shifter in the process.

-Some time after, Reiner, Berthold and Annie start the process of destruction of humanity by making a whole in the outermost wall. They also use the confusion that ensues to infiltrate humanity and find information about the Coordinate's power. Ymir also uses the confusion to infiltrate the walls. 

-On that same day, Grisha, Eren's father, goes to a chapel where the Reiss family is praying. There, he turns into a titan, slaughters everyone except Rod Reiss, and eats Frida, who can turn into a titan as well. Some time after, he turns Eren into a titan and gets himself eaten by him, therefore giving him whatever power he acquired by eating her.

-Some time after, Eren has his first dream in which he sees memories of Frida. 

-Some time later during that day, Eren, accompanied by his sister Mikasa and friend Armin, sees his mom getting eaten by a mindless titan and vows to exterminate all titans. 

-2 days after the invasion and the events at the chape, Kenny and Rod Reiss go to the farm where Historia lives with her mother. There, Kenny kills Historia's mother and Rod orders Historia to, from then on, live into hiding under the alias 'Krista Lenz', which is also the name of the girl in the book that Frida used to show her. This is presumably done to protect her Historia from Grisha. 

***Year 846***: 

-The government sends over 250 000 people to their death in order to solve the food supply shortage issue.


***Year 847***: 

-Eren, Mikasa, Armin, Reiner, Berthold, Annie, Ymir, Historia, Sasha, Connie and others join the Trainee Squad.


***Year 850***: 

-All members of the Trainee Corps mentioned above graduate and most of them join the Survey Corps.

-Eren turns into a titan for the first time, which makes Reiner, Berthold Annie suspect that he might be the one they're looking for (the Coordinate). 

-Annie and Berthold use their titan form to further their plan and try to capture Eren which they now suspect. Reiner is also shown working with Annie, although he does not use his titan form. 

-Annie is discovered as the 'Female Titan' and captured, although her titan technology makes it impossible for the Survey Corps to interrogate her. In the process, bits of the walls are removed, which allows the Survey Corps that the walls are probably filled with giant titans.

-At some point during that year or before, another titan-shifter, known as 'Monkey Trouble' infiltrates the wall. He discovers that humanity speaks the same language as him, and that they have developed the 3DMG to fight off titans. He later tests how effective that technology is by turning Connie's village into titans through unknown means and ordering them to attack members of the Survey Corps. In order to protect her comrades, Ymir turns into a titan and fights the mindless titans. Berthold also comes close to turning into a titan in order to protect himself from Ymir, which he initially perceives as an enemy, but changes his mind at the last second when he realizes that she is protecting him. It is unknown whether Monkey Trouble is still within the walls. 

-Also at some point during that year, Rod Reiss sends his men to question and then assassinate Pastor Nick, whom he believes has been giving away information about the true identity of his last living child (Historia).

-Shortly after, Reiner and Berthold suddenly reveal their true nature and mission to Eren, and turn into titans, engage in a fight with the Survey Corps and end up leaving with Eren and Ymir as hostages.

-Later, high up in the trees in one of the giant tree forests within the wall, Reiner and Berthold have a conversation in which they discuss Monkey Trouble, Ymir reveals that she spent 60 years as a mindless titan until she ate their friend Marcel, and Berthold admits that he and Reiner had to go through to the same process as her (eating another titan-shifter) in order to escape their mindless titan form.

-The next day, the Survey Corps goes after Reiner and Berthold. Eren manifests his Coordinate's power for the first time and saves everyone from them by overwhelming them with mindless titans. However, at the last second, Ymir decides to go with Reiner and Berthold and saves them. 

-The following weeks after these incidents are about the Survey Corps trying to and ultimately succeeding in overthrowing the monarchy. Historia and Eren also discovers important parts of their respective histories during the 5 years prior to the start of the series and Historia now believes her father to have been an ally of humanity all along. 





 




 That night when Reiner broke through the wall, he must have seen him or Berthold and he most likely knew that they were titan shifters, given what he knew about titans and based on the fact that he was probably a shifter himself.

I wonder if that's what triggered the sequence of events that happened afterwards. We know what went down at the chapel happened on the same day that Reiner broke through the wall. I wonder if Grisha knew this was gonna happen and was waiting for it to actually happen to start carrying out his plan, or if he used the confusion that followed to his advantage. 

Maybe Grisha knew all the children would be gathered at the chapel to pray and figured it was the best occasion to slaughter them all? Whatever happened, I'm sure it's not a coincidence that this all went down the same day as when Berthold and Reiner invaded the walls. 

 




 We know that the whole scene where Kenny kills Historia's mother and then Rod tells to her to live under a different name happens only 2 days after the events at the chapel.

What if Rod and Kenny did this to protect Historia from Grisha? If Grisha wanted to kill all the Reiss children for whatever reason, then surely Historia would have been his next target. But maybe Grisha ignored what Historia looked like or that she even existed, but Rod didn't know this, so to protect her, he killed everyone that knew her and then made her change her name so that Grisha would never find her. 

Obviously Grisha died not long after the events of the chapel but Rod probably didn't know this either back then. 

What do you guys think? 

I'm basing this on the fact that Rod seems to genuinely care for his children and doesn't come off as the villain as I initially thought he would be. Also, if Grisha was able to kill the Reiss children despite the fact that at least one of them could turn into a titan, then his titan must have been quite dangerous, and Rod might have felt that if Grisha attacked them again, he would not be able to protect Historia from him, and so he figured that her best chances of survival would be if he sent her away from him. That's just a bunch of assumptions though. 

Also, now that I think of it, Historia did say, in the latest chapter, that her father 'didn't have any other choice than to kill Pastor Nick' or something like that. Perhaps that was also to protect Historia?  




 The fish can that Ymir found at Castle Utgard was his. I'm convinced now that he spent quite a bit of time within the walls as a human before turning into a titan, turning connie's village into titans and then leaving. That's how he knew that they speak the same language. 




 I know it sounds crazy, but what if he did? Imagine the following scenario: in an alternate timeline, humanity is destroyed by RBA and their people because the Reiss family is unable to protect the power and it is stolen from them. The power itself needs to be transfered from one generation to another every, say, 50 years, and it's during that time that humanity is the weakest because the new holder is not able to use the power to full effectiveness yet. This is why Reiner refers to that power as the 'Coordinate': because it's a given point in time during which the power is the easiest to steal, in other words, it's a time coordinate. 

Grisha returns in time just some time before RBA invade humanity in order to thwart their plans. He goes to the chapel the night the transfer is supposed to happen, interrupts it, transfers the power into Eren instead, and hopes that by the time RBA's people figure out that Eren is the new holder of that power they're looking for, he will have had enough time to go to the basement and learn how to use the power to protect himself and humanity from them. By doing so, the power is never stolen, humanity is never destroyed, and Grisha has altered the course of history. 

What do you guys think?  




 What if Reiner called the special power the 'Coordinate' not because it happens at a given location, but because it happens at a certain point in time? What if he meant that it's a 'time coordinate', a certain point in time at which the power gets passed down from one generation to the other and humanity is therefore at its weakest? 

I'm going to make a bold claim here, and say that the night the fall of the wall happened, the Reiss family wasn't just praying, they were also preparing the ritual to transfer the power. What if the power has to be transferred after a certain number of years? 

I'm going to make an even bolder claim, and say that Reiner, Berthold and Grisha all come from the future. That's why Reiner and Berthold have a seemingly more advanced Titan technology. In an alternate timeline, RBA manage to destroy humanity and take back the Coordinate's power. However, Grisha knew this, so he came back in time as well, hoping to alter the course of history. That day when Reiner destroyed the wall, he knew very well that that wasn't a regular mindless Titan, and that was his signal for the start of the invasion by RBA's people. 

In an alternate timeline, humanity got destroyed because the Reiss family were unable to protect themselves. So that night he went to the chapel, tried to convince them that he needed to take the power in order to protect humanity, but they obviously refused to believe him, so he had to take drastic measures. He got into a fight with them, killed them all, took the power, and gave it to his son. 

He was hoping that, Eren. not being suspected by RBA, would have enough time to go to the basement, learn how to use the power, and save humanity from the Titan invasion. I'd say this was a huge gamble, and it almost failed, but in the end it did work, as Eren was able to use his power to get away from Reiner in chapter 50. 

What do you guys think? I know the story Isayama takes inspiration from is big on time travelling, and this would answer a lot of questions about the mysteries of the story so far.  




 I don't know if you guys remember, but in a conversation with Hanji, Erwin said that the question that would answer all the questions was basically: 'Why do the Reiss want Historia even though she doesn't have any power?'

As of chapter 62, I still feel like this is really true.  




 My theory is simple: what if Grisha made a mistake that night at the chapel? What if he lacked an important piece of info or something simply didn't go the way he expected?

I've concluded that it's impossible to determine what really happened that night, because not only do we have too little information about the exact series of events, but we also know little about the Titans themselves. In fact, at this point we know so little about them that it's impossible to determine whether the Reiss are something special or rare. What I mean by that is that there might be other people like the Reiss family out there, or other people with a ''Coordinate's power''. All we know is that they have something related to Titans. 

Furthermore, not only do we not know what happened that night, but we also ignore both what exactly happened between him and his son and how much time passed between the events and the chapel and the events between him and his son.

Finally, we also ignore Grisha's intentions, knowledge and background or life experiences. Why did he do this? How much did he know about the Titans' nature, and about the Reiss family and the Coordinate's power and the relationship between the two? How did he come to acquire all of his knowledge? That's possibly the most important thing, or set of things that we do not know about. At the very least, it's safe to assume that he was very aware of the Titans' existence, and that he knew of methods to turn people into what we call ''mindless Titans'' as well as methods of turning mindless Titans into what we call ''Titan-shifters'' (people who can turn into a Titan, but also retain control of their human body and can switch back and forth between the two forms). It's also likely that he possessed the physical means to turn someone into a mindless Titan, but that's not certain. 

But that's really all we know about him. A lot of what we've been told about him feels intentionally vague, and what we have been shown about what happened that night could very well be intentionally misleading. So the only theory I feel that it's reasonable to come up with is that he made a mistake, that something went wrong somehow. The thing about science is that it's often extremely reliable unless you have a relatively large sample to work with. So if something did, in fact, go wrong that night, then we can assume one of two things: either he conducted some experiments on Eren, and the latter didn't respond the way he had anticipated, or there was a crucial piece of information about either the Reiss family, the Coordinate's power or the Titans themselves that he didn't have and which caused things to go wrong. 

Regardless of what happened, I feel like, ultimately, it all comes down to 2 distinct theories: either Grisha getting himself eaten wasn't accidental and he wanted that to happen for some reason, or something went wrong which caused him to get eaten. In case he did get himself eaten on purpose, it might be because something went wrong and he did that as a last resort. At this point, the only thing that I'm truly convinced of is that something wrong that night for Grisha, and that's what lead to things going the way they did, regardless of whatever really went on that night.

 




 ...Is how he became a Titan-shifter in the first place.

We know he didn't eat anyone from the Reiss family, because he murdered them all some time after becoming a Titan-shifter himself.

So he must have eaten someone too, but who? The only titans within the walls that we know of are the Reiss family, Eren and his father. The others come from outside the walls, and are very different from Eren.  

Furthermore, eating another Titan-shifter cannot be the only way to become a shifter yourself, because otherwise, how did it all start? But if Grisha knew of that method that doesn't require the eating of someone, then why did he sacrifice himself to Eren? It must be because eating was the only way he knew or had access to, which means that he must have eaten someone in order to become a titan-shifter himself.

Clearly, he knew how to turn people into mindless titans because he did it for Eren, but who did he eat to become a shifter himself? Forcibly, there must have been other people within the walls who were titan-shifters in the past. Either that, or he comes from outside the walls. 

Also, what prevented him from doing whatever he had in mind himself? What made it so that he had to give the power to his son instead? His sacrifice cannot have been accidental, because he became a shifter himself and could turn people into titans, so he must have known how the whole process works.  




 When he said 'you're the last person in the world who should have this, Eren', I know he was referring to the Coordinate's power, but what did he mean by that?

Is it because of Eren's personality, which Reiner thinks makes him unfit to possess that kind of a power? Or is it because of Eren's circumstances?

At first I thought that he simply meant that Eren should not have possession of this power because he does not know how to use it and has no one to teach him how to do so, or because him having it could make it easy for some people, like the monarchy, to steal it.  But now I'm starting to think that he might have meant that Eren is an impulsive, irrational brat who is not the right type of person to hold such a burden...

In all cases, regardless of whether Reiner is 'evil' or not, it's at least safe to assume that he knows more about this power than most if not all of the other main characters at this point, so if he says that Eren should not have it for whatever reasons, then I trust him. I'm not saying he's right, but he's the only one whom I feel has enough information about this situation to have an opinion about it.

Basically, there's a discussion between Erwin and Zackley about the future of humanity. Zackley tells Erwin that even though he wanted to overthrow the monarchy as well, their motives for doing so are very different. 

Then there's a discussion between the members of the Survey Corps, they talk about a chapel were members of the Reiss family were killed years ago, and conclude that they should head there.

Then the story switches to a large cave, where Historia tells Eren that her father has been an ally of humanity all along.

Then Rod Reiss tells Eren that even though he has never been here, he should have memories of this place.

Then Rod Reiss and Historia touch Eren's back, and then Eren has a flashback of the Reiss family praying in a chapel, then his father (Grisha) setting fire to the chapel, and then his father extracting the Titan's power from a Titan that looks like Historia. 

Then Rod Reiss says: Do you remember your father's sins now?

Then Eren has another flashback, his father cutting his own arm off and then himself in his Titan form attacking someone.

Then Eren has an horrified look on his face.

End.  




 Basically, I think all Reiss girls are ''vessels'' for the Coordinate's power, and that Historia is merely a back up one.

From my understanding, the Coordinate's power seems to be a special version of the Titan's shifter power, and, in order to acquire that power, the user has to become what the reddit community calls a 'mindless Titan' first.

So this is what happens: upon birth, the Reiss girl gets turned into a mindless Titan, and then literally eats her predecessor (the Reiss girl who had the Coordinate's power before her), acquiring both her power and her memories in the process. I'm unable to explain for what purpose the previous holder's memories are acquired, but perhaps it has to do with the nature of the Coordinate's power itself.

However, in case the Reiss girl is, for whatever reason, unable to acquire the Coordinate's power, then there needs to be a ''backup vessel'' that can hold the power until there is a girl from the following generation who is ready. I think Historia is that backup. She is an unlawful heir, and not a true Reiss, but she can still hold the Coordinate's power. However, because this heir is not legitimate, it cannot have a will of its own. That's why Historia was not killed, but also not raised properly. Because her mother didn't care, she has low self-esteem, lacks self-control, and struggles to create relationships. Therefore, she's easy to be toyed around and controlled by Rod Reiss until another Reiss girl is born and ready to eat her. In other words, she is the perfect backup vessel for the Reiss family.

Also, I think this is why Geographia was teaching her. She was teaching her how to use her power properly to serve the Reiss family in case she is actually needed as a vessel, but was also making it so that she forgets all of what she knows unless she's in presence of Geographia, so that she can do nothing on her own. 




 









 ...all have the same last name? 

You know, for Levi, can I understand, because he did say that Kenny kind of raised him when he was a kid. So I can see how Kenny giving him his last name would make sense.

But Mikasa... what does she have to do with all of this? Is it because she's an 'Oriental' (whatever that's supposed to mean), and Kenny and Levi are that too? Are they supposed to be related by blood? Or is Ackerman some kind of code name for people who are part of a particular group or possess some kind of special ability or are special in some way? Is it a codename for people who are 'Orientals'?

I re read through a lot of chapters, especially those in which Mikasa and Levi are involved together, and I found nothing about this. In fact, I'm pretty sure the fact that Levi and Mikasa have the same last name is never mentioned or brought up in any way whatsoever. Kinda strange. They've known each other for, what?, years now?, and they've never discussed that? 

And now Kenny also has that last name and there isn't anything said about it? 

Am I missing something crucial here? Are we supposed to actually know what that means and I'm just retarded?
 




 I'm surprised so few people are discussing this, but in the chapter 50 extra, Historia reveals that Krista Lenz was the name of the girl in the book Geographia was making her read in that flashback. That girl was also seen doing something with the Titans.

Does it mean there was actually a girl named Krista Lenz who lived at some point in the past? I mean, if she was in a book about the Titans, and Rod Reiss also used her name for Historia, it can't be a coincidence...  




 At the end of chapter 50, the narrator (which appears to be Historia), says 'I couldn't understand Ymir's actions at that time...'

Does that mean that what we're reading right now is humanity's past narrated from Historia's point of view?  




 After all that's happened to him, I wonder if he understands... if he understands that it can't be as simple as just 'murdering all the Titans', that there are actual people to blame for everything that's happened to him so far, and that these people sure aren't just Reiner and Berthold. Most importantly, I wonder if he understands that there is still a LOT of things that he can't and doesn't understand about himself, about the world surrounding him?

And if he does understand all these things now, I wonder if it will tone down his constant range, and make him take a more rational approach to all this? 

What do you guys think? Basically, my question is, has Eren grown psychologically, or is he still the same angry fit brat who wants to murder all titans?  




 She refused to tell him what she knows about the world and Titans, and she ran away with the two people he hates the most at the moment.

After chapter 50, do you guys think Eren sees her as an enemy?  




 Why? Because we're all expecting a crazy reveal... some awe-inducing, insanely complicated scientific explanation behind the whole Titan thing. And Isayama is a mangaka, not a scientist with decades of research on humans' central nervous system under his belt, so he's not gonna be able to live up to those expectations. At least not to mine. 

I know this is going to be controversial, but hang in there for a second. I believe that, the manga at least, has been hugely popular so far because of the extent to which it is shrouded in mistery... Everyone is eager to know about what exactly the Titans are, about the world's history, and about everything that relates to that, such as whether Monkey Trouble is a titan shifter or something else, who are RBA's people, what is the Coordinate's power, where is Grisha and what has he done to Eren, etc. And so the hype about all those mysteries is building up, and the expectations have become incredibly high.

But when shit hits the fan, and the time for Isayama to give us all the answers to those mysteries comes, is it going to be as awesome as everyone is expecting? Like I said, everyone is waiting for some crazy scientific theory maybe mixed with a bit of fantastic stuff, but in all cases, something that gives everyone the nerdgasm they've been building up to for years... And there's a good chance that Isayama isn't gonna be able to come up with something like that. That it won't be nearly as complicated or original or mind-blowingly awesome as everyone is hoping. 

Anyway, I might be a negativist, a pessimistic... But that's what I think. And to think that makes me sad, but thanks to that I'm avoiding building my hopes up super high only to fall from my high horse down the road.  




 Ok, I don't know if I'm the only one with this issue, but I've been trying to build a witch hut farm using this design:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?annotation_id=annotation_531937991 feature=iv src_vid=PzR0hfkhxmE v=RGynJ0yOhmA

I've used docm77's 1.8 fix, and the side with the comparators and repeaters works just fine, but the other side, the one with just the comparators, doesn't work for me, and I can't figure out why. Basically, the pistons that are supposed to push the redstone blocks just don't get activated on that side. To be more precise, it's also the side with the glass blocks.

Anyone knows why this is happening? 




 Am I the only one who wouldn't be surprised if we learned, at some point in the future, that the Titan's power was made as some kind of war weapon? It's been implied that the world of SnK has been at war for centuries. What if the Titan's weapon was the result of a major scientific breakthrough that had then been used as a weapon to turn the tide of a world conflict? 

If you think about it, it has formidable war-related applications:
You can turn enemy soldiers into mindless giant zombies that turn against their own people by trying to eat them;
You can turn your own soldiers into 'war machines' with super-human healing/regenerative capacities and which become vastly stronger upon being wounded;
If your soldiers ever disobey you or become unfit for warfare, you can replace them by having someone else eat them...?;
You can increase your soldiers' lifespan by turning them back into mindless Titans when you don't need them for warfare...? (since it's been shown that humans don't age as mindless titans).

And, on top of that, there's also that mysterious power that Reiner referred to as the 'Coordinate' and which seems to be very special... Do I even need to mention the formidable uses that this power can have? With this, you don't even need to fight the enemy, you just need to mind-control them into obeying your orders.   




 Personally, I don't. I merely see them as illustrating the moral complexity of the story, and that there is a lot of going on outside the walls, and that there are different factions whose interests are clashing. 

Sure, RBA have indirectly caused the deaths of many innocent people by tearing a hole in the wall. But then again, how many innocent people did the Survey Corps kill and that could have possibly regained control of their human form? Also, the monarchy has killed countless people who were a 'little too smart' on top on altering the memories of entire generations. 

So yeah, I don't see RBA as evil. Just another one of the story's factions/groups with its own interests. At this point, every group in the story has been killing and doing arguably evil things in order to serve its own interests.  




 In chapter 50, when Eren first manifests his Coordinate's powers, Reiner says that they 'must retrieve it' referring to the Coordinate. In the dictionary, to retrieve means 'to recover' or to 'bring back'. Therefore, when Reiner says that, it is implied that his people once had that power.

We know that the monarchy has had that power for at least a hundred years. Now if the Coordinate's power was stolen from RBA's people over a hundred years ago, why did they wait this long to send people to try and retrieve it?

Also, Berthold implied in his conversation with Ymir that he had spent quite a bit of time as a mindless Titan too, unless he ate someone, possibly a Titan-shifter. 

My theories is therefore that most of RBA's people were turned into mindless Titans some time after losing the Coordinate's power, and spent decades unable to control their body until some of them found a way to return to their human form. And I also believe that this only happened in recent times, which is why it's only now that they sent warriors to try and retrieve it, instead of, say, 50 or 30 years ago.

So, about RBA's age, I'd say, based on everything I just wrote, that there's a good chance that they are actually decades old just like Ymir.  




 A lot of people are trying to come up with elaborated theories as to why Reiner chose THAT timing to reveal  his identity and finally try to carry out his plan of bringing Eren back to his 'hometown'.

In plain terms, I don't think there is any elaborated theory here. I think he simply lost it, and went full retard. It's true that they were being suspected of being Annie's accomplices, but they obviously had no idea about that. Besides, the Survey Corps had no way of figuring out their real identity unless they blatantly made use of their titan's powers in front of them. 

They could have used their position as soldiers within the Survey Corps to keep gathering useful information and eventually come up with an elaborated to kidnap Eren relatively easily and safely. 

But instead, Reiner decided to reveal everything just like that, at a random place and time when the entire Survey Corps was chilling just a few footsteps away from them. It doesn't make sense, especially when you're a highly trained soldier who was entrusted with the task of carrying out a very important mission (wiping out humanity and bringing back the Coordinate). 

I think this was very unprofessional of Reiner and Annie, simply put. Berthold didn't want Reiner to do this, you could clearly tell, and in a way he is the only one who carried his mission until the end... Reiner became conflicted and did something that had clearly not been thought through, and Annie developed a soft spot for some people that she could have easily killed when it was necessary (like Armin). 

TL;DR title pretty much, Reiner went full retard, and Annie too, and that's why their mission failed in the end. 

 









 and actually make Eren get eaten and die.

Because, let's be realistic here, everyone is expecting Eren to not get eaten and everyone is expecting the Reiss family and Kenny   friends to ultimately fail. 

But I think the story would take a very interesting turn if, for example, Historia does get Eren's power, but then turns against her own family and the monarchy, and ends up using her new powers against them and saving the Survey Corps from all dying. In fact, I think any scenario in which Eren as well as some other Survey Corps members end up dying would be quite interesting and completely unexpected. 

But obviously this won't happen because Isayama isn't GRM and this isn't GoT... Although Isayama did say in an interview that he was planning to make SnK a 'everyone dies in the end' kind of story, but that was before the story got insanely popular worldwide, so yeah, I have low hopes here...  




 It's technically impossible that having a mindless Titan eat another Titan shifter be the only method to become a Titan shifter yourself, because if it is, then how did the very first Titan shifter come to be?
There has to be at least one if not multiple other ways to become a Titan shifter.

Now I'm starting to think that the Titan's power being transferrable through eating is either an unwanted and unplanned side effect of the whole thing, OR a later modification that someone made to turn the Titan's power against its maker.

I think something like this happened: Someone made two variants of the Titan's power, one that neutralizes the enemies by turning them into mindless creatures that will turn against their own people by trying to eat them, and another much more powerful version where the user keeps control of his body and becomes a powerful human weapon. The first version was used on the creators' enemies, and the second one on their allies.

However, later, someone turned that weapon against its creators, by making it so that the mindless Titans can 'steal' the second more powerful version of the Titan's power by 'eating' those who possess it, also regaining control of their human body in the process.

I think RBA's people were on the 'brink of extinction' (i.e. in the process of all being turned into mindless Titans) until a few of them managed to capture enemy shifters and have their own people eat them. Berthold did imply that they had to eat people. I'm also not sure what the Coordinate's power has to do with all of this though, but I'm pretty sure that having it would allow them to turn the tide of whatever war/conflict they're caught into, given how powerful that power actually is when the user knows how to use it to the fullest extent. Also, Reiner did say that they must 'retrieve it', implying that they once had control of it, so they must know how to use it. 






 




 I mean, come on, this was a little too easy, right? These old noble men, all they do is spit out a lot of big words. And when you stop listening to those big words, they become powerless.

The real final battle/faceoff will be against Kenny   friends, who not only possess the anti-human 3 dimensional gear, but have also been shown to be far more skilled and to have far more knowledge than the other people serving the monarchy. 

These people are probably where the Reiss family is, and that place is also most likely where Eren is being held. They are obviously the people with the actual power within the walls, and if the Survey Corps can't defeat them, then I believe they won't have made any significant progress, even if they got rid of the old noble men who, when you think about it, have no actual power and are only there to look good while the Reiss get the dirty job done with the help of Kenny   friends. Think about it... Even if now the masses know what's really going on, all they have to do, once they have Eren's power, is use it to wipe everyone's minsd and then boom, everything that the SC has done so far is in vain. 

Also, I believe that Kenny has always been a part of this... Even when he was murdering soldiers in the capital, it was also in the name of whatever purpose he's serving right now. I'll even take it a step further, and say that he is the mastermind behind all of this, at least in the present day (since the walls have obviously been up for longer than he's been alive). In other words, he's been running the show for a while now. Either him, or the leader of the Wall Cult is the actual leader within these walls. And right below that leader is Rod Reiss (in terms of power/influence). 



 




 I think the link between them is simple. Historia is the latest member of the true royal family, and Eren somehow possesses the Coordinate's power.

Rod Reiss doesn't want to eat Eren himself (like Hanje said), he wants Historia to do it. Whatever happened to Geographia (the person to previously have Eren's power and who looked a hell of a lot like Historia), it's obvious she doesn't have that power anymore. Maybe she's dead. We don't know her fate yet, but it's irrelevant for now. 

In all cases, if the monarchy still had her power, they wouldn't have told Erwin that they are 'waiting for those guys to have that power', they would have used 'that power' already instead, and people would have been mind-wiped already by now. 

There's a lot of complex theories out there, but I think it's that simple. The plan is for Historia to eat Eren so that the Coordinate's power can return to the Reiss family. 

 




 We know from the manga and anime that, originally, humanity was on the brink of extinction because of war. One day, a bunch of rich people left in boats and made it to a new continent where walls had been 'prepared' for humanity to live in and where it would live in a world 'eternally without strife'. Then they altered the memories of the first generation and made all outside world knowledge taboo and all that stuff.

What if this was originally done with good intentions? Humanity was at war for whatever reasons, and then someone started turning people into mindless Titans, hoping it would rally the different nations under a single cause as they would have to work together in order stop the Titan's 'virus'. However, this backfired, and the war escalated as those different nations tried to have sole possession of that Titan's power.

Over time, some people saw how vicious humans were in their natural environment, and how the Titan's power had just made things worse, and they started dreaming of a better world. In other words, what if those people originally wanted to create a legitimately happy functioning society, also known as a utopia? A world free of not only technology that makes it easier for humans to kill each other, but more importantly, free of the Titan's power, which, in the past, had clearly failed to bring people together.

However, their enemies were strong, and so they still needed to use the Titan's power themselves if they wanted that dream world to become reality. They knew that their society would never work if people knew that there was actually something outside, so they decided to use drastic measures in order to make it work. 

Over time, like in all typical utopic societies, some of the people in charge became greedy and selfish, as their immense wealth and knowledge started getting to their head. And that's why we have people like the fake King Fritz in the current story. But I believe there are also people with good intentions and who have kept the original goal of having this better world in mind. I believe Pastor Nick to be one of those people: When he saw the struggle of the masses within the walls, it affected him deeply, but he decided, based on what he had been taught, that things would become much worse if he let out the secrets of the world, and so he was genuinely ready to die in order to protect them. And in the end, he probably did (although he might have also been killed because they suspected him of giving away some of those secrets, but that's another story).  

Now, obviously, I'm not saying that all the people currently in power are not corrupt and selfish assholes. In fact, I believe they are deliberately portrayed as such. But my point is that this world within the walls, which by now is clearly a lie to the reader (and by that, I mean that there's clearly a lot of going on outside and these walls aren't all there is about the world), was originally created with good intentions

Also, was it right to take away people's free will and keep them from finding out about the world outside through whatever means necessary, even if it means murdering those who are a 'little too smart'? Well, probably not, but I don't think anyone can question the genuine desire to make the world a better place from which this whole thing started. 









 I think the reason why we're only seeing tiny bits of what's going on with Rod, Historia and Eren is because Isyama is slowly building up to something big with this whole scene, and by big, I mean a piece of information that is big compared to what we've been spoonfed so far.

I could be wrong, but I believe Isayama said in an interview that Eren would learn a 'horrible truth' around volume 15, I believe this is what he is building up to right now and that we're gonna learn about it in chapter 63 or possibly even 62. 

Now, as to why Historia is talking so casually with Rod while Eren is in chains on some kind of altar, in my opinion, it's either because Historia has been brainwashed into believing that whatever the hell is going on there is fine, OR, in a plot twist, it's because she's playing along until the Survey Corps shows up. OR, in an even more twisted plot twist, this isn't actually Historia, but a relative of her family that looks a lot like her, and Historia is being held captive somewhere else.

 




 I cannot tell you from where I got this, but all I can say is that comes partially from 4chan and also from another Chinese source who has apparently obtained some info on things that will be revealed by Isayama in the next 3 chapters, starting with a flash back involving Erwin in 61.

First, what my source tells me is that there indeed titans in the walls, and that these titans are a means of controlling the masses. The real people in power are the noble families, who possess the means to 'activate' or 'call forth' those Titans and have them alter the minds of the people, like Geographia did to Historia. Apparently it has something to do with their huge size, but this was too unclear for me to state much about it. 

I know it's hard to believe, but bear with me here, you will see this all unfolding in the next few chapters. 
 




 ...for the Survey Corps when that's basically what they've been doing since the start of the story - killing humans? 

It's been shown that humans who were turned into Titans can be brought back to their human form, which means they are still alive.

In other words, they've been killing breathing humans all along.  




 This is what got me into SnK in the first place: the hope of seeing badass Titan fighting scenes. The Clash of Titans arc made my wish come true, but all it really did in the end was leave me wanting much, much more.

I had initially thought the Clash of Titans arc was merely the beginning of it all, but never was I so wrong... All we got afterwards is people with no Titan form, shooting at each other with 17th century guns. 

Whatever the Titan's power is, it's obvious by now that the SnK world is full of people who possess it, so why not give us Titan fighting, Isayama? 

I'm sorry, but the current arc is super-extra-mega boring. I want Muay Thai fighting Titan shifters and godzilla-sized ones. I want pure destruction! If the Coordinate's power is really as important as Reiner says... if the old world societies have really been at war with each other for centuries like the story seems to imply... then why isn't there a bunch of people trying to retrieve it? Why just RBA? 

Sounds like what's going with their 'hometown' would be a lot more interesting to read than this boring ass excuse of a story we've got going at the moment.  




 http://calorescence.tumblr.com/post/51450703198/did-you-know-the-inside-covers-of-the-japanese

'Unable to match the overwhelming force of the Titans, humanity was forced to sail to a new world. At this time, most of humanity had been annihilated, but the majority of this was at the hands of their fellow humans.'

'In the new world, great walls had previously been prepared.'

This is contradictory, because we now know the walls were made using the Titan's power, and if they made the walls using that, it means they knew how to use it. And if they knew how to use the Titan's power, then how could they have been 'unable to match the overwhelming force of the Titans'?

Or maybe that's what they wanted everyone to believe?

Somebody explain this one to me.  




 It's hard to see that if you can't read Japanese, but at some point in the anime there's some text shown and which basically states that, long before some people even left for the new continent where the walls would be eventually, the world was war-torn. And because of that, there weren't many humans left.

I'm wondering why the world was at war. Any idea? 




 What if Lod Reiss actually IS the highest authority within the Walls, and the reason why Kenny isn't answering to him is simply because he's working for someone OUTSIDE the walls? 

IMO, it's either Kenny is working for people that don't live in these walls, OR the actual authority is the leader of the Wall cult, and he has hired Kenny to make sure that no one finds out the truth about the world in which they live. That would make sense, since, in ancient times, the religious leader often had more power than the king himself.  




 From pages 42 to 45 of chapter 48, I think there is a lot of foreshadowing, and I'm saying that having a good idea of how Isayama does things. 

'Being hated by people...' - Picture of Eren: I think this means Eren will be hated by everyone because of his powers.

'Only the time that we were acting as soldiers was... enjoyable...' - Picture of Reiner: He will never be able to fully go back to who he was before the attack on the walls because of his time spent with the Survey Corps; he will have an identity struggle.

'Please, somebody... I'm begging, somebody please find us' - Pictures of Ymir/Berthold: I don't know what this could mean specifically, but I think it hints at how all of the shifters have miserable lives and we will learn that in the future.

'Somebody will have to stain their hands with blood' - Picture of Armin: Armin will have to learn how to become an evil motherfucker who slaughters a bunch of people, basically. This is trending with his character development so far, so it makes sense to me.  









 When Berhold says this to Ymir:

'It can't be helped if you don't remember. It was the same for us, too. Eren doesn't seem to remember either. So that's how it works....'

What exactly is he talking about?  




 Erwin said that by fightning Annie and all, they had chosen the lesser of two evils. 

Well, what if that's what RBA have been doing all along so far, choosing the lesser of two evils? What if they had no choice? What if the survival of their own people depends on whether they retrieve the 'Coordinate' or not? 

Ymir told Eren, referring to R B, to not 'make such small fry his enemy', implying that there are some much more dangerous people out there who are probably the ones behind all this. Also, the way R B have been talking ever since the big reveal, it sounds like there's a part of them that didn't want to have a part in all of this, that they would have actually preferred to be simple members of the Survey Corps fighting Titans in order for humanity to survive. 

Ever since that big reveal, many people have been portraying them as villains, but something tells me that they're merely pawns trapped in a great game of chess that some people (or at least some sentient beings) are playing. 

Anyone else feels this way? By the way, I'm not justifying their actions, I'm just saying that it's probably a lot more complex than just a bunch of kids being sent to destroy humanity.  




 She was right when she said she wanted to take Historia away because the world inside the walls would soon turn to hell.

Pretty sure that's what's happening right now. It has begun. First the end of the monarchy, which leads to chaos. And then the Titans inside the walls wake up, rise and march.  




 I've noticed that the term is used quite a bit in the story. In fact, RBA all seem to refer to themselves as 'warriors'.

I wanted to know what that could possibly mean, so I've done a little bit of research, and what I found allowed me to come to many interesting conclusions. 

If you look up the definition of the term in any dictionary, you will see those 2 definitions:

1) Someone who is experienced or engaged in warfare; a soldier;

2) Someone who has shown vigor, courage or agressiveness in an activity, cause or conflict.

However, it's actually more complicated than that. I've done a bit of research. In our modern world, the term 'warrior' is mostly an anachronism, referring to the Middle Ages, when most states recognized warriors as a separate caste within an army (knight, samurai, etc). These people usually had high athletic abilities and fought on the ground with nothing but an armor and some kind of weapon.

Nowadays, the term that widely replaces warrior is 'soldier', and the only exceptions are in the context of propaganda, when people are being encouraged to take part in a conflict or cause.
In other words, it is mostly used metaphorically.

Based on this, the question here is: are there actual warriors, people trained specifically for combat and recognized as such within their  own society, in Shingeki no Kyojin? In that case, 'warrior', I would guess, refers to people who possess/have been given the Titan's power and are trained to use it for military purposes. I'd say the answer is yes, because I think it's highly unlikely that some random kids would have this kind of power and be sent into enemy territory to carry out a dangerous mission. Wherever RBA come from, people are probably trained for this kind of thing from a very young age and warfare is probably an omnipresent thing. In other words, is it probably a highly militaristic society. 

If I'm right, this also tells us a lot about the level of technology they have in Shingeki no Kyojin. If people could blow each other up in a few minutes using nuclear bombs like we do, there would be no need for a thing such as the Titan's power. In our society, warrior castes, that is, people who actually fight themselves and use their athletic abilities as their main 'weapon', started disappearing as technology started advancing rapidly and warfare started becoming more of an intellectual thing. In fact, nowadays, that's what warfare is: entirely an intellectual thing, and very little manpower is actually required. Just fast planes and anti-missile shields and missiles that can reach their target from super far and nuclear bombs that can destroy all life in a relatively short period of time. 

To say this differently and also conclude, their technology is probably very limited outside of things that relate to the Titan's power. In fact, if some religious freaks used the Titan's power itself to build those huge walls, it's probably because it was the most efficient way of doing so. On the other hand, I would guess that Titan's power-related technology is probably a lot more advanced than we have been shown so far. For people outside the walls, this whole Titan thing, whatever it is, is probably a widely known and common thing that everyone uses for various purposes, or at least for war. 




 




 So it's pretty much canon now that there's a whole world full of human beings outside of the walls, right?

I mean, first, in the anime it says that, a long time ago, a bunch of well-off religious men made huge ass walls using the Titan's power and then brought a bunch of people with them there by crossing the ocean with boats.

Secondly, we know from the manga that RBA clearly come from somewhere outside the walls. 

Also, it's been hinted in the manga that the government erased the memories of the people who came from outside of the walls. Add to that the censoring of books, suppression of technology, religious propaganda, etc..

If this isn't the author telling us 'The people Inside the walls have been living one big lie for over a century now', then I don't know what it is.  




 Wikipedia defines eating as 'the ingestion of food or other object, usually to provide heterotrophic organism particularly for energy and growth.' Maybe some of the Titanized humans rely on some source of energy, but by no stretch of the imagination do they need any kind of food in order to survive. We've seen what happens when they eat human flesh: it just stays in their body, and when there's no room for it anymore, they just start regurgitating it. 

 So why do Titans manifest the behavior of 'eating' human flesh? Well, in the past, I was totally puzzled by that question, but I believe the answer's been given to us in one of the recent chapters, through that conversation between Ymir and Berthold about Ymir's past. Out of that conversation, we can come to two inferences: first, when humans get turned into mindless Titans, there's still some part of their body that remains somewhere in there, and they are still conscious to a certain extent, although they have obviously no control of their actions; and secondly, through a process that involves a mindless Titan literally ingesting the body of a Titan-shifter, the former can acquire the latter's power and regain control of his body. 

 Now, based on this, here's my theory:

 I believe that, at the start, there were at least two people at war with each other. One of them somehow developped what we know as the Titan's power, and then made two variants of it: one that would not only render their enemies powerless, but also turn them against their own people, by transforming them into mindless Titans that are programmed to try and 'eat' humans; and another much more powerful variant that would allow them to empower their own people and turn them into weapons of war (aka the Titan-shifters). 

 However, later, someone else acquired that Titan's power and turned it against its creator, by altering it so that people who would be turned into mindless Titans would be able to steal a Titan-shifter's power through a process that would involve ingesting his body. 

 I know it's somewhat far-strected, but there are two things that make me believe this. 

 First, we know from the anime that the world outside the walls is a war-torn one, and that the first generation of people who came to the world within the walls were lead by a bunch of religious, well-off men who wanted to establish a war-free society. Furthermore, it was said that the walls had been created using the Titan's power prior to the arrival of the people there, which implies that the Titan's power existed long before that.

 Secondly, we know from both the anime and the manga that the society in which RBA live seems to be a typically ruthless, warfare-oriented one, in which people start training for fightning at a young age and fight all their life. 

 Based on that, I believe that the people living outside the walls have been at war and fightning each other using the Titan's power for a very long time, possibly for centuries before the start of the story. And it's easy to imagine how having the Coordinate's power would allow RBA's people to turn the tide of that war/conflict that they're in.

 Anyway, tell me what you guys think. This is my theory on why Titans try to 'eat' people even though they get seemingly no benefit from doing so, based mostly on that conversation between Berthold and Ymir about the latter eating the former's friend who was most likely also a Titan-shifter.  









 Hanji told Erwin that, if they found out why the people in power within the walls want Historia even though she has none of the knowledge about the Titans that people in the family usually have, they would solve all of the mysteries.

Well, simply put, I think that something has changed and now Historia is the only suitable person within the Reiss family who can receive the Coordinate's power. Remember, Kenny Ackermann didn't mind coldly killing Historia right in front of her father the last time he saw her. If he still wanted to kill her, I think he would have done it a while ago. 

I believe that a certain Titan's power can be passed from one person to another, and that, somehow, the memories of those who had that power previously can be accessed. That's why Eren's father told him 'their memories will help you'. That's also why Eren can have 'visions' of Geographia. 

The way I see it, the Coordinate's power was always possessed by a member of the Reiss family up until Eren, and that is why they are the real royalty. The last person to have it before Eren was the mysterious mind-wipping girl (a.k.a Geographia). How do I know she was a member of the Reiss family? Well, first, she was taking care of Historia, probably because the latter was a relative, and also because she was the only one who could have a contact with her without getting in trouble due to her powers. Secondly, in his 'vision', Eren sees her living in luxury, almost like a princess. 

Now, why Historia would be the only suitable person, well, I'm not sure, but I have a few theories. Maybe, a simple reason is that she is the only/last living member of the latest generation of the family, or maybe only certain people can receive that power and they want to know if Historia is one of them. 

Anyway, tell me what you guys think. But I'm almost certain that Geographia was the previous Coordinate/had the Coordinate's power. In chapter 54, in Historia's flashback, when she wipes her mind, there is the exact same visual effect as when Eren uses his power to command the Titans against the one who ate his mother. That can't be a coincidence. Furthermore, Geographia seemed horrified by the idea that Historia could someday grow up to become like her... Probably because she had to do a lot of 'dirty work' using her powers. 




 









 Please, tell me, does it exist? I need to know for scientific reasons. :P

Searched on Google, couldn't find anything.  




 WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE SNK WORLD IN GENERAL:

-The old world, where all people used to live before some of them left for what is now known as the world within the Walls, was already war-torn before the appearance of the Titans.

-Some of that old world's richest people left for a new continent, the world within the walls, over a hundred years before the start of the story. However, there are still people living in that old world nowadays (RBA's people). There seems to have been a religious purpose in creating the world within the Walls (in the anime it says that they wanted to create 'an ideal world, without sins').

-The memories of the first generation of people living in the world within the walls were altered somehow so that they wouldn't remember life before the Walls. There is also at least one person proven to have mind-altering powers (the Mysterious Girl).

-The royalty of the world within the walls is not its actual highest authority, as the Central Military Branch does not seem to work for the King (Rod Reiss). 

-The Walls are not only around the world in which what is known of humanity lives, but also beneath it. They were seemingly made with some Titans' skin-hardening ability and those Titans are still dormant within them, possibly as a result of the absence of light. 

-The Walls were 'made' before the arrival of the humans on the new continent.

-The language spoken by the people within the walls is not the only one spoken by humans throughout the world at large. For example, at Castle Utgard, there was a food can with inscriptions in another language on it, and Ymir was able to read it. 

-Reiner, Berthold and Annie were originally humans turned into mindless Titans until they somehow became Titan-shifters. Whether this was done by eating other Titan-shifters or through another method is impossible to say based on current knowledge.

-Ymir went from a fully-fused Titan to a Titan-shifter after eating one of RBA's friends who was also a Titan-shifter.

WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE TITANS:

-The Titans are in reality humans whose body has, except for the spinal cord, completely fused with the material of which the Titans are made. After fusing, that person still 'exists', but cannot control neither his human body nor his Titan one. Furthermore, while fused with the Titan, humans do not age, and if they ever go back to their human form, they will have the physical age of before they fused. Finally, the process through which humans are turned into Titans is unknown, but does not require physical contact. Also, the only sentient being who was shown as being able to turn humans into Titans is the possible Titan-shifter known as 'The Beast Titan'.

-It's possible to alter the process that turns humans into Titans so that the human will not have completely fused with the material of which Titans are made. Those people are known throughout the community at large as 'Titan-shifters'. These people can both turn into their Titan form and go back to their human one at will, although being a Titan seems to be physically exhausting for the human and, therefore, those people can only be Titans for a certain period of time. What causes this is unknown. Furthermore, it's also possible to alter that process so that the person's Titan will have altered/enhanced characteristics that makes it a lot more threatening than the average Titan, or that makes it serve a specific purpose, such as height, hardened skin, etc.. 

-Some Titans, both regular (a.k.a fully fused) and Titan-shifter ones, seem to rely on light from the sun in order to move around, and to be inactive at night. Although this is not the case for all of them. 

-Regular/fully-fused Titans seem to be able to gain a Titan-shifter's Titan-shifting abilities by literally eating him.. This might explain why all Titans try to eat humans: unconsciously, they do so in hope of eating a Titan-shifter and being freed for their Titan form. This behavior might be encoded into the (or at least one of the) process(es) which turns humans into Titans. 

POSSIBLE BUT UNCONFIRMED TITAN-SHIFTERS:

-The Beast Titan, the Titans within the Walls, the Titan in the book that the Mysterious Girl showed to Historia. 

UNCONFIRMED THEORIES ABOUT THE TITANS:

-It's possible that being a Titan-shifter is physically exhausting due to the human body and brain having to control a large quantity of physical matter (the material of which Titans are made). 

-It's possible that, if a Titan-shifter stays in his Titan form for too long, he will start fusing more and more with his Titan until he has lost of control of his human body and become like the mindless, regular Titans.

-It's possible that a Titan-shifter's Titan is influenced by the person's human body's characteristics or vice versa. For example, Reiner is physically strong and bulky, and therefore so is his Titan. Another possible example: Berthold's Titan is enormous and therefore releases a lot of heat, which makes Berthold sweat a lot in his human form. 

-There might be multiple processes that allow humans to be turned into Titans. The one used by the Beast Titan might not be the only one. It might also be possible to turn a human directly into a Titan-shifter; that seems to have been the case for Eren. Just like Ymir, Eren underwent some memory loss while undergoing the process that allowed him to become a Titan-shifter. This might mean that the process which turns humans into Titans modifies something in the human brain. 




 




 How did RBA know that what they were looking for (the person with the power to control the Titans) was within the Walls in the first place?

Also, why does the royal family want Historia, when she is not eligible for the throne and has none of the knowledge that the other members of her family seem to have about the Titans?

Same for Ymir and Reiner and Berthold. They seem to regard Historia as an important person, but she has no freaking clue what's going on. They seemed to believe that Historia could help find them find the person that turned out to be Eren, yet she is as ignorant as the others.

Why? Am I missing something here?

 




 I mean, for what god damn reason would you NOT read the manga version of any story when it's the original, most accurate version of it that exists? 




 Is Annie dead??

Will we ever see Reiner and Berthold again? Will we ever see their history, how they grew up and the events that lead to them being sent to the walls to find the Coordinate power?

How did they know that what they were looking for was within the Walls in the first place?

Did they undergo the same process as Ymir, that is, they wandered mindlessly until they ate another titan-shifter? (Berthold seemed to imply that when talking to Ymir)

Are they considered some of their people's strongest 'warriors'? Or are they considered weak and we will see some much powerful titan-shifters in the future? 

What do you guys think???

 




 http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Attack_on_Titan oldid=614559035 diff=614617202

It's still waiting for review, but I've added this part to the 'summary of the story' part of Snk on Wikipedia:

'However, as the story progresses, the plot shifts in focus, being centered more around Historia Reiss, a young girl who is a member of the Survey Cops and whose mysterious royal family is suspected of knowing the truth about both the walls protecting humanity from the Titans and the Titans themselves.'

It could use some tweaking, but you guys get the idea. This might be a spoiler, but people can't expect to visit Wikipedia without coming across a spoiler. Also, saying that the story is merely about Eren, Mikasa and Armin fighting Titans (which is basically what the Wikipedia description says atm) is simply not true. That was basically the story up until chapter 30 ish... and ever since then, the story has been more and more about Historia Reiss, her role within the royal family and about how that royal family is linked to the secret truths about the Titans as a whole. If you look at Eren's role from the POV of someone who's reading the manga, he is merely one of those people who happen to have the ability to turn into a Titan-like version of themselves (he also has the 'coordinate's power', but considering that we know this power is transferrable, Eren himself is nothing), and I actually believe that Historia plays a more important role than Eren in the story now. We'll see how the plot evolves in the upcoming months, but to say that the story is still only about Eren and his two childhood friends fighting Titans to save the world is plain wrong. That ended when the Clash of the Titans story arc started, and since then the story has been about something much deeper. 

 


 




 Hey guys, not really a question that can be answered, but I was wondering if in the future there would be a story arc where we see what Reiner, Berthold and Ymir do after the end of volume 12, that is, them travelling to Reiner's and Berthold's hometown and seeing what happens to Ymir once there and all that stuff.

I think it could be very cool. :) 

 




 If Eren really was a mindless Titan who wandered outside of the walls and then ate someone with Titan-shifting powers like Ymir, then why doesn't he remember any of it?

Ymir remembers it well enough to know for how many decades she wandered mindlessly.  














 There's something that struck me as odd in volume 12.

In the extra pages of volume 12 (http://imgur.com/a/T6yk3#LeKKqp4), Reiner asks Ymir 'why did you come to OUR territory?'

What exactly is Reiner referring to, there? He is considering the Shiganshina district as their territory? Does he mean the Titans' territory? Does that mean he consider himself a Titan and not a human?  




 At the end of volume 13, Historia says that she's never gonna forgive Ymir for siding with Reiner and Berthold and leaving with them instead of staying by her side. Although it seemed like Ymir did it more out of pity for them rather than because she wanted to side with them, but anyway, Historia doesn't know that.

Do you think she was just angry and confused or they're really gonna be enemies from now on? (if they ever meet again, that is) 




 There's a few things that I don't understand.

Reiner seemed to believe that having Historia on his side would help him find the person that turned out to be Eren. 

It was also said that the Reiss family is the actual authority within the walls.

Yet, Kenny seems to obey to someone that isn't Rod Reiss. Does that mean Kenny is working for someone outside the walls?

Also, what does the Reiss family represent? They know about the secret of the walls, I guess? But even if Reiner knew that the Reiss family knows  about the walls, what's the link between these Titan-filled walls and Eren's ability to control Titans? Could it be that Eren can make these Titans break free from their 'wall form'? Or does Eren have some other power that he's not aware of yet?

I'm really confused.  









 Ok guys, here's a crazy theory that I came up with. 

In the extra pages of Volume 13, Historia strongly hints that Krista Lenz is actually the name of the girl in the book that the mysterious lady with the mind-wipping powers used to make her read.

(You can find these extra pages here http://www.ishuhui.com/archives/2416)

This in itself is a big revelation, but I'm going to take it further and say that the girl in the book is actually the mysterious lady herself. My bet is that the wall-worshipping people are also those with the mind-wipping powers and who wiped the minds of the first generation of people living within the walls (this is confirmed by Erwin's father who was taken away for discovering this).

Now in the book, we see a girl worshipping a Titan. My theory is that the mysterious lady is also the girl in the book and her real name is also Krista Lenz, or at least she's a person related to someone who actually existed and whose name was Krista Lenz.

Crazy theory I know, but that's what I think.
 









 This is my theory based on all the info we have so far from the manga and various other official sources.

My theory is, simply put, that an order of religious people created a 'dream-world', in other words, a perfect world where people could live based on their ideals.

To me, it seems obvious.

We know that the walls were 'made' by someone beforehand for humanity to live in them.

We know that the memories of the first generation of people living within the walls were erased.

We know that religious organizations have a big presence in the story, and that people from that religious group inside the walls are bent over on keeping the truth about the walls secret.

So this is what I think happened. A bunch of religious people wanted to make their own little world, so they made the walls. But it's one big lie, and since we know only the rich and powerful left for that world, the rest of humanity must have survived somehow and is still occupying the world at large. 


 




 Hey guys,

I'm not sure how to explain this, but if you buy the actual physical copies of the volumes, there is 'hidden' Japanese text at the bottom of the pages.

I'm also not sure if it's a manga or anime spoiler, because it appears in some of the volumes that already have been animated, but here goes:

A long time ago, humanity lived on another continent. It was a war-torn world, and a lot of people had already died because of the endless wars. 

Because of this, humanity was severely weakened, and when the Titans started appearing, it was unable to face their overwhelming power.

So the humans decided to leave for another continent. It had also been decided that this new continent  would be 'sacred' and 'protected from sin', and so at the time the Walls had already been 'prepared' (not sure about how this word translates) for humanity to that end.

In the end, only the most rich and powerful embarked on the boats that would go to that new continent. The trip was harsh, and by the time humanity had arrived, only half the boats were still there.

Soon, however, the Titans started appearing on the new continent as well, and it was decided that humanity would never leave the walls again to protect itself.



That's it. Sorry if it's not well translated, I tried my best. 


My own interpretation: Based on this, the world within the Walls was made as big one lie, as a dream world where the outside world doesn't exist and those in power lie about it. Also, most people who didn't leave the continent probably found a way to survive.

Do not get emotionally attached to any character, Hajime Isayama did say in an interview that most of them would die before the end of the story. This is a 'hopeless' type of manga, there will be no happy ending.
