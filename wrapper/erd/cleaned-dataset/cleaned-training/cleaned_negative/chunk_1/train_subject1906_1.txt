 are the Muslim extremists? sorry, too soon Ik.

Seriously though, these 'sound' as though acts of true desperation. It is not as though NK has a lot of allied countries.

Worrisome as the economic situations of the poor keep plummeting in so many places globally. 




 ' "This action is an unjustified provocation against the feelings of 1.5 billion Muslims," the authority, Dar al-Ifta, said." '.

Get over it already! If you don't like what you see either stop looking at it or out your own eyeballs. Stop attempting to dictate what other people choose to think/draw/write/imagine/love/teach/wear/believe/and so on   on   on etc.

 I keep reading people saying things that imply the other user of their e-mails doesn't realize they are using the wrong address.

Actually..I have encountered many people that simply do the (name)(name)@gmail.com thing as a means to bypass the required email on every single form/application/etc.

Just saying.

The Heart Of The World-The Elder Brothers Warning (documentary The Kogi Elder)    http://vimeo.com/103812927   
  About: ""The Heart of The World: Elder Brother's Warning was filmed by Alan Ereira for the BBC in 1991
"In a desperate attempt to prevent further ecological catastrophe and destruction, the Kogi Mamas broke their silence and allowed a small BBC film crew into their isolated mountaintop civilization to hear their message and warning to Younger Brother (those (un)conscious people who mashing up our environment). The subsequent messages and warnings were voiced in this documentary. After the documentary was filmed, the Kogi Mamas returned to their work in isolation and asked outsiders to not come to their land.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Kogi soon realized that their message and warning had not been heeded by Younger Brother, and instead, as they had predicted, many catastrophes occurred and the natural world continued to be devastated at an even more rapid pace.[7] In turn they contacted the same filmmaker twenty years later to give one final message. This became Aluna, a documentary made by the Kogi Mamas themselves in which they give a second warning and say that they have chosen to share their secret sciences with Younger Brother so that Younger Brother can help change the world for the better."

ok I am now lost in the internet discovering these people:)  Will edit if I both find more fun stuff   remember to post.

They argued to where the whole neighborhood heard them.

I felt frightened. And ashamed.

  The Pass was actually confirmed as results of an avalanche

 That is what you said initially.   
  Then you tossed in a Wiki page, the first sentence of which refers to 'avalanche' as "plausible":"but avalanche damage is considered one of the more plausible explanations for this incident.[4]"

 It goes on: "Possibly negating the avalanche scenario is that investigators saw footprints leading from the campsite, with no obvious avalanche damage noted."

 /u/Iamnotyours makes a very good point regarding these 2 incidents. 




 you have a source? 




 ty! 




 Quite sorry. I had decided that it was currently 2013.

 well if the only time you can educate your children by making a zoo visit is on "no whites allowed" day, then that is what one might do.

I would take my child to museums on the "free day", as that was what was available.

 oh my, have to agree.
 "PETA euthanizes nearly 90 percent of the animals it takes in, a rate often criticized by other animal groups. PETA defends its practices, referring to itself as a shelter of last resort - a place that provides a merciful death for animals too sick, old or otherwise unfit for adoption.

But state regulations call for a minimum holding period of five days, said Debra Griggs, president of the Virginia Federation of Humane Societies. Pickups are also required to be reported to a locality's animal control.

"In Maya's case, PETA did neither of those things," Griggs said. "It's a serious violation."

Aside from that, she said, the video shows "a happy, healthy, sweet dog on its own property, and that flies in the face of everything we believe in - not only about our pets but our property rights in general." 




 google something like 'pakistan breaking agreements list'. have fun. 




 gee why don't I trust your response..

 As has been mentioned a lot, your mom is beautiful!  What a lovely photo of a happy woman:)   

Thank op, and I wish much love   happiness for the newlyweds   for yourself. 




 Opinions are influenced by one's gender though, IMHO.  

Forced wearing of the hijab, or of any other enforced clothing, will often have gender-specific reactions as to 'how important is it?', as an example.

Let me see what people are saying..ah ok, here ya go: http://www.ted.com/conversations/23808/how_does_gender_affect_formula.html

oh and 'gender bias' is a thing. Google. 




 The hijab is a VERY obvious sign of the oppression of the female populace, it those countries where it's wearing is not a choice.  




 Google always thinks I am a male. 

Suppose Reddit makes similar errors?

The telco giant will also pay $20 million in penalties and fees to the 50 states and Washington, D.C., and a $5 million penalty to the FTC. At the time of the settlement, an AT T spokesman noted that the company was the first in the telco industry to stop charging customers for premium SMS messages in late 2013. The FTC is currently suing T-Mobile over the same issue."

 Here is the problem.  Young Michael Brown was a tall, large teenager, he looked like a grow man, ' he was 6' 4" (1.93 m) tall and weighed 292 lb (132 kg).

Mr. Brown was 18 years of age. An adult.

I can understand how intimidating a young man of that size might be.

Michael may or may not have been a bully; reports say he was much better than that, but the video!!

I give my warmest heart felt condolences to his parents, family, friends.

I know of no one with a perfect child; we are each   every one, simply human.

Now why burn down you town?  Honest it is a very bad reflection on the black/white relationships here in the USA.

Please calm down out there, peaceful protest will garner far more support than the videos of a liqueur store being broken into,the toy store, the etc. shops.

sorry  am rambling, it sucked to have to call my son (working in a Newark hospital, just to review the 'if you get stopped by an officer keep your hands in plain site on your steering wheel. If you are asked for ID tell the officer that you will need to reach into you back pocket, ask is that ok?  Always speak respectfully." 

If you should get arrested, call your parents! You are entitled to a call.
Keep your mouth shut until you have  a lawyer, say nothing.

But for goodness sake , the images of looting in the community liqueur store, toy r us, etc you all are setting back race relations like 50 years!! 

Just stop the stupidity, fires do not help.
 




 ty, my son is working ER rotation in Newark Nj tonight.  I appreciate all news. 




 thanks.
 




 can you share those please? 




 oh. That makes sense somehow, thanks:) 









 I paid my rent, gave my son a 125 check   took him out for an inexpensive dinner for his birthday,  ( he is in school). I spent 25$ to renew antiviral, bought some little food, am basically ok atm.

But I am literally down to pennies, and was wondering if I could borrow 35$ from someone until my next pay day, 11/21.

I know many are in much more need, I am happy to have a roof, a wonderful child, lights   internet access, but naturally all my grand planning has left out a few odd things like a prescription renewal, and that cup of coffee I usually buy before my 12 hour work days a couple of times a week. 

I have no idea how this works, how money gets moved about, but scouts honor I will pay back the 35 next Friday the 21st (will probably be after work, like 8pm ish est)

I have had backpackwayne added as a friend for ages, unbeknownst to him, as at one point I was having terrible trouble finding a job that could pay my rent in nyc, and he was so wonderful in offering advice and listening to my laments!  (so now I rent a room in jersey city btw).

Not a druggie, not a drunk, work at low $ job atm, planted daffodils (free from the city), love life, love my family, love tghis sub, and always wish I could help more. 

Anyway I thank you for your consideration. Would be greatly appreciated! (lol though I warn you again, I will need to have it explained how this actually works:)

Thank you all amazing people! 




 just ty in advance!

 Teen Driver Charged In Hit-And-Run Death Of Ariel Russo, 4, Accused Of Dragging Police Officer
September 3, 2014 5:05 PM 














 I'm an American with deep respect for the members of our military. Today I have heard countless people wishing others a "Happy" Veteran's Day. When I think about my great uncle's mustard gas poisoning; what my father saw liberating concentration camps   afterwards, returning with yellow fever from Panama; my brother's stories of being dropped behind enemy lines in Vietnam..well I just weep, and say a very quiet 'thank you'.  I can't seem to bring myself to think of Veteran's Day as 'happy' knowing the hell so many have gone through. While it was still armistice day, I can see people using 'happy', but now? My question is this: What sentiment would you folk like to hear on Veteran's Day, today   in the future?   thank you all. 




 I just came online, and my multi bar is gone. Anyone else getting this? Any clues why this has occurred? 




 My Italian aunt (mom's sister) has always told me that my father's father was 'black Irish'. Now I have gone on the assumption that this meant he had dark hair/brown eyes, possibly a remnant (in my eyes) of that dang Roman invasion of ages ago.   However! I have searched 'black Irish' here   in r/history   r/Irish history   /r/ Irish....only to find that Montserrat video:(   So! Please historians, more in depth info pretty please??? 
























 Someone please explain why I need to wait 8 minutes between saying "that's old" and saying "you all seriously need to stop making me laugh, my computer is getting nervous.  
And yes, you do totally win!"

umm seriously, tell me what is it that I am doing too much?  '

(after my original wait time expired said"no nipples?" to the naked woman/man poster. Still was required to wait another 8 min.)  WHY???

also what is the FC named? May take me until tomorrow to ask that here. And yes I saw the side post link, put it did not work on this differently advantaged comp of mine. 



























































 I haven't received any notice to go to court, just a letter from landlord's lawyer telling me to pay or they will begin court proceedings. I know I will have to go, but am so afraid of an immediate lock-out.  

Will I get any time to finish packing?  

Please help, I need info!!! 









 Seem's to me I read BBC, CNN, Huff.post and just see redigested news I read here first. (BBC is actually much better, please forgive me). MSNBC also seems so slow.

  So please tell me where I can find the newest, most honest news please!??!?

EDIT: goodness I love Reddit:) Thank you to you all so far.
