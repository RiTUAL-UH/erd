 wat? 




 Why does it make matters worse that he's happily married??

 I hitchhiked in Guatemala. It's kind of the way to get around - just jump in the back of the pick-up that they are invariably driving! Completely uneventful - it's honestly the taxi service when you get out in the country  




 As a student, you kind of have to accept that you will be asked to participate in ways - ways that you may not exactly enjoy or perhaps not see the value in. The best policy is to buck up and get to it. It will last a semester, and then you can go back to not participating on facebook. If you object to sharing personal information - then don't. Put the minimum up for participation in class and then delete afterwards. 




 My husband managed to get through all of law school by only buying one book (one that he actually wanted to keep). His secret? Interlibrary Loan.  




 The fuzzy gum drops showed up on a golf cart. Crowd immediately congregates. I snap some pictures and catch one of the first-responders who had touched one of the mascots. In the photo she is looking at her hand as though she had just gotten to touch Jesus Christ himself.  




 My family was at a Catholic festival next door to our house, and my dad was playing craps. My brother, probably about 4 at the time, yelled "COME ON, DADDY NEEDS A NEW PARACHUTE" 




 There was also an incident when I was in kindergarten where my mom had volunteered for a field trip and the teacher had written her name on the board. I came home and told my mom that the teacher had misspelled her first name, which is Amy. How had she spelled it? Mrs. 

I think it was the three letters that thew me... 




 Saw a Civil War chess set being advertised on tv (Limited Time Offer! Buy now!) and asked my mom what the "Silver War" was. 
 




 Just got back!! It was awesome! :) 




 Most of the witch hunts didn't happen during the medieval period/Middle Ages - it happened in the oh-so-enlightened Renaissance. The Malleus Maleficarum, (literally "Hammer of the Witches", and essentially a "how-to" manual for witch hunting) wasn't written until 1486, and subsequently published in 1487. It was helped on massively by the advent of printing in the West (1450s). It was so inflammatory even the Catholic Church condemned it as false in 1490. 




 Also ladygamer - I honestly sometimes just avoid multi-player altogether. I like to play after work to de-stress, and hearing an array of sexist insults (kitchen jokes on the low end of the spectrum here), getting hit on (uh just want to play my game, oh, and I'm married), and then being called a tease because I'm not interested is not exactly relaxing. I end up playing single player games just to avoid the abuse. Which I will be the first to recognize is not helping - but my evenings are precious and I don't want to spend them trailblazing.  




 I have flat feet which in turn cause an internal leg rotation which in turn equals ouch knees and hips. My doctor actually recommended that I sleep with a pillow between my knees! 




 I even have a puzzle of the center of the triptych :) 




 I have always loved this building and the behind the scenes tour is definitely worth it. Not shown in the post is some views from the catwalk that goes atop the entrance way (not inbetween the front windows) - it allows for a great view of the murals. Also, there is more to see in the president's office - perhaps I'm a nerd, but I thought the built-in file cabinets are sweet. Last but not least - the private dining rooms, especially the ceiling fresco of Cincinnati, but also the upper conference rooms that have been restored fully as well. 

Loved it so much I got married there a little over a month ago :) 




 China even falls under these same categories - it has a very large number of minority groups and have been ruled by a few of them over the many centuries. The whole conflict over Tibet is a great example of this. Whatever we may think most current nations really are "made up" and fabricated over centuries - even well established countries. Even countries isolated to an island have had multiple ethnic groups with multiple countries (Hello, Scotland succession!). Even Japan, a traditionally homogeneous gene pool have had it's conflicts (southern islands, Ainu, etc.).  




 At least in some states there is a committee that flags questionable vanity plates. A friend of mine interned there and had found one with "PONFAR" on it. She flagged it and then had to inform the entire committee about the Vulcan mating ritual. By all accounts they stared at her for about 30 seconds and let it through :) 




 I've been inspired - I would definitely love to attempt something like this soon! 




 Especially if you've seen Doctor Who - DON'T BLINK 




 And as always in art, the details have always been the difference between the real deal and a knock off.  




 More brutal...and she already has a boyfriend. 




 I have to put forth Jim Grobe at Wake for doing the  most with the least. I mean this in a broad sense of not just talent, but also dealing with resources. Let me explain:

Wake has never been known as a football powerhouse - hell, we're the third smallest FBS school (behind only Rice and Tulsa) with only 4,000 or so undergrad students. That's not a whole lot of alumni to draw from in terms of funding...they're dedicated; but it was pointed out in the Orange Bowl in 2006 (which they lost against Louisville), that if every living alumni and student went to Dolphin Stadium...they still wouldn't fill it up more than half way. 

So, they comparatively don't have the alumni base to donate the big money for the football program. Being a small private school also means that we don't have a ton of in-state or other fans just because...say like, UNC or OSU.

Secondly, Wake is a top 25 school that is highly competitive and academically very challenging. It's hard for dedicated athletes to keep up with both. And there are definitely not a whole lot of majors to "hide in". The classes sizes are very small and the faculty is not disposed in the slightest to give the athletes any extra leniency.

All of these things lead to smaller resources, and fewer opportunities to recruit top athletes. Yet somehow, Grobe has managed to make competitive teams with what he has.

TL;DR: With few monetary resources and an environment not conducive to big programs, Grobe has managed to make something out of nothing.

 I definitely talk like Toki and Skwisgaar for fun. Hilarious with metalocalypse fans....fuckin' bizarre when they're not 




 Freeze them!! FREEZE THEM NOWWW! /endAaahnoldvoice 




 How cute!! 
Google Translate didn't lead you wrong...at least not too much! That is indeed the kanji for carp, but often times Japanese people just use the katakana -  - which is, admittedly, not as aesthetically pleasing. So using the kanji is just somewhat formal. 

I could nitpick your kanji form - but that would just be insufferable - and it's definitely good enough for non-Japanese speakers!!

I too am in the same boat of hyperactivity - no Crisco exorcisms though! I haven't been able to just watch television since I was a kid - I always have to do be doing something with my hands! 




 Moxie is also older - 1876.  




 yeah it really is just because of the "Iron Man" connection - which was played in Iron Man 1. 




 I find that most bands will usually only have one design in a female version...if  even that. The options are usually pretty slim... 




 I love this building so much I'm getting married there in about 3 months :)
