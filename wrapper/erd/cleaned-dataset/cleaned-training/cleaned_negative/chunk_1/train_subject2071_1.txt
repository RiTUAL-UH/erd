 Giraffes - 

I've never seen a giraffe, I never want to see a giraffe. They just terrify me. They're colossal, their neck weighs the same as a small car, they have the ability to kill a pride of lions, they also have a 20inch tongue.  









 Old people. They have more memories, more jokes, and more life lessons.  




 'He's 24 months' 

Your child is 2.  




 'You study law? You'll be useful to keep around' 

Oh my god! So original! Never heard that in my two years of study!  




 Getting food in different clothing  




 'MURICA 




 My brother is 18 years younger than me. When he was 6 he asked me why, when he was cuddling his teddy, did his 'willy not stay floppy'.  




 A lot of Runescape. 'Going Wildy' 




 In sex scenes when they 'finish' and they get up and carry like there's no semen trickling down the woman's leg.
