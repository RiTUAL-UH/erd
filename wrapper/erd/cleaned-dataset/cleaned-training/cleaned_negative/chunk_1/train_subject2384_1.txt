 Cite your evidence please. And show me where there was a consensus, not just one economist going out on a limb and claiming there would be a crash. 




 Economists' opinions mean nothing. They are not very good at predicting the stability of the economy. A majority of economists thought things were going fine in 2008 before the market crashed.

They're glorified historians. And I don't mean to insult historians, at least they're honest about the fact their work deals with more the past than the present. 




 Just finished Ready Player one by Ernest Cline. Looking forward now to his next book, Armada.
