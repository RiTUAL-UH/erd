 https://www.snapchat.com/geofilters/tips.html

The link guides you through how to make a geofilter for snapchat. Boulder has one (I'm not a fan of it),  but CU does not have one. While some off you don't use snapchat, some of you enjoy graphic design. Depending on how many people submit something, I may give out reddit gifts/gold. 
Ideas you may consider- notable buildings, Ralphie, the Flatirons, scenic area, or any design you can come up with.  








































































































 I know Eldora's terrain park is nothing  to brag about, especially compared to other Colorado resorts. Can anyone who's gone recently give me an idea of what to expect when I go later this week? I usually stick to medium sized features so hopefully a good amount of those.

 What needs to fall into place, what games do you need to win, what miracles must occur?  



















 Regardless of actual snowfall, which cities complain the most about snow?  
























 Looking for opinions. I personally think Keystone and A Basin are good for days without snow. Everyone has their spots at certain areas  




 Title says it all. Would be cool to see how much money programs get from their conference and how much comes from big games like this  




 I'm in arts and sciences (iphy) and want to take a basic marketing and maybe a management course. I have an opportunity to work in pharmaceutical sales for a bit after school before graduate school. I looked at theses course and they all are restricted to business schools students or have bcor prerequisites. Does anyone know of any that an A and S student can take? I'm a senior so I meet house requirements as well  









 Last final is Wed, that means Thursday is ski day. I can go to eldora, Winter Park, and the epic local areas. Who wants to go?  




 For Colorado, Ski Booker. Shooting 37% with 2.3 turnovers a game. He has 99 FGA, the next highest on the team is Scott with 67 FGA. The only think Booker contributes is steals and assist. 

edit- now he goes 7/14 for 20pts today. of course.  









 Went to doc two months ago after sleeping 8 hours in 3 days. He gave me 5mg ambien. Worked well as a half dose, some nights I needed the full 5mg. Just started my 3rd bottle, fell asleep at 5am, 5 hours after taking it. Sleept til 11am. 
Then this time I took full 5mg at 12 am, a half at 1am, and at 2 am. It's now 6am and I feel tired but awake  














 Oregon wins and they are in the playoffs, Arizona wins, they are in and Oregon is out (unless all other top teams lose). Who do you think should represent the pac in playoffs and why?  




 Going to eldora friday (opening  day). Looking for people to ski with this year if anyone wants to go. I'm into all aspects of skiing, have an eldora, epic local, and winter Park pass  




 I want a small plant for my desk that can handle low sunlight  light and dry air. What do you have? 









 First game thread so bear with me.
Looks like tip off may be delayed due to SMU/Gonzaga. I'll be ducking out of here after the first half since I still have early morning midterms so if any streams or other edits come available please comment them.

 Following 3 straight NCAA tournament appearances, you're Colorado Buffaloes take on Drexel in the first game of the year. Game is Friday at 6pm in Boulder. Stubhub tickets are selling for $6. 
Colorado is ranked in the top 30 nationally, predicted 6 seed for the NCAA tournament. 




 I recently found out Eldora used to have night skiing but haven't seen anything on why they no longer offer it. Below is a night trail map. I'm guessing it had to do with forest service, night traffic on the canyon, or not being profitable. I've night skied at Keystone and it was empty but  I figure night skiing would do better at Eldora since it's so close to Boulder. 


http://www.coloradoskihistory.com/images/eldora_overview_1.jpg

 









 Title says it all. Yes it is more basketball relevant but we're at the time where  other sports overlap. I wanted to post here to keep things a bit civil versus r/cfb and r/collegebasketball people yelling at Eachother. 

Has the UNC scandal changed your view on players receiving payment?

Personally I would be for taking for away scholarships and paying players under $100k. I'm not in favor of more successful schools getting to pay more money, then they just keep buying more talent and competition is gone.  









 I just signed up for skicarpool.org and it's pretty active, is anyone signed up with something  better? I'm looking to help people carpool, everyone knows i70 could use a break  









 Since Colorado and Wazzu are the bottom two but unfortunately don't play each other, I'd like to open up a discussion of predictions if they did. 

Colorado- 0-6 (2-7)
key games- overtime loss to Cal and UCLA 

Wazzu- 1-5 (2-7)
key games- win at Utah, close games against Oregon and Cal

Edit- pretend Halliday is playing  




 Got my first eldora pass (college discounted) and have never been. I'm looking at driving up for opening weekend, is it worth it? I've done A-Basin when they have just a few runs open and enjoy it but don't find it to be worth the drive since you spend so much time in line. 
Also, anyone that wants someone to ski with, I'm in Boulder with epic local and eldora passes  



















 Looking at getting an eldora pass to go along with my epic local. I didnt get much time to drive i70 last year and want to get more days in so eldora is a huge appeal. It's $179 for the season pass, prices go up to $229 on Nov 4. 

I don't know anyone who goes to eldora, anyone looking for someone to ski with? 

Also anyone with epic local.

Site crashed for a bit this morning, Arizona is almost sold out. Get tickets now! 




 http://espn.go.com/college-football/statistics
 


































 I will have the epic local college pass but because of my schedule I won't get out to summit as often as I'd like (enough for the pass to be worth the money). I'm also considering the Elodora college pass ($159) since it's closer to Boulder. 

 I've never been to Eldora and know it's smaller but the bus from Boulder is a great appeal. I saw it's added to the WP/Copper pass which will add to the crowds. 

Would it be worth getting the pass for days that I can't make it to summit? Is the terrain/snow as bad as they say?  














 I searched the sub to see if its been asked and I didnt see anything so I will be another EMT B student asking a question. 

Is it worth keeping your class books after completion and passing the registry exam for review or reference?  









 I'm currently an under grad finishing General Chemistry 2. I will be taking Organic 1 in the spring. I have looked around at general prerequisites for school and found a wide range from only general chemistry, to requiring biochemistry (some survey some full). Which level chemistry did you finish with and how limiting/excess was it when applying to programs? 



















 Will take as low as $40 credit 




 I have a camera but it can't do night scenes very well. 
I would love a picture of the flagstaff star with Venus (which is very bright the next few days) and maybe even the moon in the shot. 
I'm sure any photographers reading this may think it could make a great shot. Maybe with CU or any other boulder landmarks as well. 
Anyone willing to take the shot and post it? 




 I'm sure you get a lot of these questions but I'm looking for a good study guide for the EMT-B exam. I won't be taking it until this summer but there are way too many options to choose from.  




 just what title says, thanks  




 For any of those who have their name on their job shirts, do you use full name, first name last initial, or first initial last name? The latter seems more professional but patients would typically call you by first name which is easier to remember if it's right on your shirt. 




 tapped out started crashing for me a few hours ago. After I tap the continue page it will load for 5-10 sec then crash. I have tried reinstalling the app and turning my phone off/on. Anyone else experiencing this?
Iphone 5/ios 7 




 I have a pair of 2012/13 liberty helixes. I bought them used and they had a demo binding on them (removed before I bought them). I was able to center mount them and rode them 3x before season end. I am considering remounting them to cab forward. I had salomon suspects for 5 years before this pair and had those center mounted as well. On the helix i was having difficulty staying afloat in the powder and initiating turns on groomers. I'm not sure if this is from not being used to the ski or if i should move my binding to cab forward. 
so should i try moving them knowing that once i do they are stuck there for good, and how should they hold up with 3 binding mounts done?

i tried finding a ski gear subreddit and the best was wintergear with no activity, if this should be in a different subreddit i will happily move it. 




 Season 8 ep 1. Quinn says Barney wants to ride down the isle on a bear. The ring bear? 
Caught my attention while watching today  




 I'm sure most of you are familiar with the Gilbert white memorial flood maker next to Boulder Creek at Broadway. I have been searching for good pictures of the marker with the flood waters, kind of like a snow stick at ski resorts. I have only found pictures with the marker when flood waters have receded. Does anyone know of any good ones?  




 I wish i was good with graphics but Im not. I would love to see something like this with the events of the boulder flood, maybe even extended the whole front range.  




 is there a way to change the default view back to month instead of week? 
also, i find it annoying how "zoomed in" the times are, only showing a few hours before you need to scroll.  














 not seeing the game thread and cant find a steam,
any help? 




 last year vail gave a college discount on the epic local bringing it down to ~$350. Does anyone (especially someone on the inside) know if this will happen again this year?  




 And the control center didn't with me a happy birthday.... 









 i have the activation error (im not registered developer) and cant get past it. itunes wont let me do anything with the phone either. how do  i get past the activation screen or downgrade back to ios 6?

 My non redditor friend has been having issues with not getting calls or messages. His alarms and calendar are also running poorly. Is this a common issue? What bugs are you seeing?  




 I know this girl personally and her charity has really taken off recently. I know she would love some more support. Here is the description written by her--

Hi! My name is Emma Rose. I am a 17 year old Leukemia (ALL) patient. I was diagnosed with cancer in January, 2012. It has been a tough year, but I am finally feeling better. I am in the maintenance phase of my treatment. Even though this is the "easiest" part of my treatment, it still consists of daily oral chemo and almost monthly spinal taps until May 2014. Since my diagnosis, so many people have helped my family and me in many ways. Now, I want to do something to give back. I want to help other kids with cancer who are also being treated at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin.  We collect comfort items the kids can use during their stay- especially pillow pets, soft blankets, fuzzy socks, iTune gift cards, ear buds, packs of gum, leggo kits, nail polish, glow sticks, and crayons. Our newest Wishlists are on Amazon. If interested in donating gifts to help the Kids at Children's WI, please go to Amazon, click on Wish Lists and then search for Emma Rose. We just completed a major donation drive called "Movie Night". Thanks to the generosity of our followers and WE Energies' donation of 100 copies of Honor Flight- The Movie, we were able to put together 100 movie tubs for the kids. Each tub contained several movies, popcorn, candy and other items for the children and their families. The tubs were given to the children on the HOT Unit, in MACC Clinic, in the BMT Clinic and at Ronald McDonald House. Since the children cannot go to the movie theater, I wanted to bring the movie theater experience to them. Thank you so much! Please make sure all donations are new and in their original packages. All mail and packages can be sent to Emma Rose, PO Box 485, Thiensville, WI 53092. Thank you so much for your generosity!  Emma Rose 




 r/snowboarding is legit, /r/skiing doesnt have enough park, lets get it 









 rewatch the first episode. Its even better with the knowledge after watching all other episodes. pick up things you missed, and find things more humorous  





























 I saw in a thread someone commenting that they thought every character would meet the mother before Ted. Well, they were right according to the CBS president. They all meet her at the wedding before Ted and he only meets her after a big chunk of the season is done. I believe they said before that he meets her on the train returning from the wedding 





























 Now I already expect to get down votes shoved up my ass for this thread but I dont care because my life doesnt revolve around reddit karma. 
Before you downvote and click back without reading, read a bit of this. 
Why do people hate the Miami Heat? The answer- they all jumped on the hate train. 
1. Heat fans are bandwagon fans. Id like to argue that its cooler to hate the heat than like them. So by hating, you joined that band wagon. I became a Heat fan when they drafted Wade. I watched Wade a season ticket holder for Marquette. I never cared for the bucks because they never caught my interest. You dont have to be a fan of your local team, everyone has their reasons for liking a team. I was a fan before Lebron and the Big 3 yet everyone assumes Im a fan because of Lebron. Wade won Miami's first title in 2006.
Before someone says "Jimmy Butler played for Marq, shouldnt you be a bulls fan? No. While I love to see how well he is doing, Wade is still my favorite Marq player. Not just because of skill, but how he is off the court. Read up on his divorce and life with his sons.

2. "Lebron is a traitor/sellout"- Cleveland didnt have a chance of a title in the near future so Lebron went somewhere he could win. So what? Every player in the NBA wants to win a title. Its a lifelong dream for professional athletes. If your a Cleveland fan who hates lebron, you should be hating the management for not building a better team before lebron left. I dont mean a team around lebron or a superstar team, just a better team. 

3. The heat are a superstar team. So what? Part of basketball is trying to build a great team that will build a franchise. When you play pick up games you choose the best players first dont you? Do you all hate the Jordan era bulls? 

4. Bosh is a dinosaur. I dont mind people saying this. Its true and the memes are funny. Thats no reason to hate a player though. There are plenty of uglier players. 

5. Lebron is compared to Jordan. Thats the standerd for basketball, everyone is looking for the next jordan. Lebron has MVPs and Olympic Medals. He doesnt have the rings but look at his past. Cleveland had no chance. He made the finals his first year with the heat, won the finals the second year, had a 27 game winning streak the 3rd year. He is a damn good player. He is not Jordan. Having him compared to jordan is not a reason to hate him. NBA analyst will always compare great players to Jordan. Kobe gets compared. I dont hate Kobe for that or for being a great player. I dislike him because he has a record for being a selfish asshole who was accused of rape.... (Tosh.0 anyone?)

I'm not saying theres no reason to hate the Heat. Im just saying you should have your reasons and be able to back them up. My reasons listed arent perfect but they are a start. There are reasons to hate Miami, but be able to back yourself up so you arent just another person riding the hate train. 
 
























 What if Rose has not returned because the NBA secretly made him wait until the Bulls v Heat series.
Im not saying this is true or possible, just a thought that sort of fits. 
1. Heat beat bulls for a couple games, but not by a lot. 
2. Rose returns in game 3 or 4
3. Refs influence game or everything just seems to go against Miami
4. Rose and the Bulls take the next games needed to win the series
5. Bulls Heat rivalry heats up
6. Lebron leaves Miami 
7.
8. 
9. NBA Profit?? $$$ 
























 Be great if someone could turn the hand into a downvote
