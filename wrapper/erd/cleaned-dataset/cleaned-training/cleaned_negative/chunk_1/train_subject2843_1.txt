 I love your hair! And you have a gorgeous figure as well! 




 Hey there! I actually designed the whole thing on graph paper and made a paper version of it before I started. I used the paper as templates for the design and cut the scrap leather. I used a stitching awl for all of the white stitches. The lace work was done with suede strapping and a leather hole punch. I measured off all the holes I made. When I attached the bottom I used a super heavy weight leather and a softer leather over it. I had one side of the stitches done up the tube part and I flipped it inside out when I finished the stitches on the bottom. I added the border of leather on the top and the split ring on the side with a rivet. It took several hours to complete.  




 Probably sucking the souls from a few innocents...Why? Are you volunteering? ;D 




 I'll never stop...;D 




 Yeah, I know! At lest it's just for shits and giggles, and isn't actually worth anything!  




 Thank you! I spent several hours on it and I was super excited to share! :D 




 Yeah, my weight loss journey, and a bunch of my handmade stuff too. Not to mention all my reddit trophies. *sigh* Oh well.  




 No. Just a clear plastic ring.  




 ....:( Very long story...It's gone though. 




 Good eyes! 




 It's a firefox, and the compound is a mission craze. ;) 




 Then why isn't my hair moving? 









 nope. ;) 




 That's really cool! I wish I had a sewing machine! 




 I always feel a little uncomfortable when I post a picture of something I made. I don't want to come across as a sales person, even though I do sell my work to people who are interested. :/ 




 Are you selling prints? 




 Okay. Where did you find these? You look amazing in all of them, but I need that first set!  









 It's sad what has become of reddit recently. :/
