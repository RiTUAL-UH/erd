 Found the issue! CPU-Z is saying the Multiplier keeps jumping from x16.0, all the way down to x4.0 - which is bottlenecking the GPU, now what's causing the CPU Multiplier to drop?

Edit: 'Underclocking' the CPU seems to of solved the issue. Hm. Could it be PSU related I wonder? 




 I've looked at any recently installed programs and removed them all - Issue persists. :( 




 Hmm. My long guess is that the GPU 'crashing' aka no signal caused by GTA has upset something in the windows files, as I've had to force the computer to shut down, due to having no display.

Hmm. I'll try booting windows disk and checking for any issues. Thanks for the brainwave.

Edit: No issues found 




 Hmmm. Nothing installed recently, I'm also running windows 7 in Aero mode, and have turned off all unnecessary processes and services. =o 




 Any game, any settings - Issue persists :( 




 That's what I was thinking, but then I remembered that it was working fine a few days ago... With the same CPU, so there has to be an issue somewhere. :\ 




 **Edit: FIXED. I don't know exactly how this resolves it, but I noticed the CPU temps going high, and the CPU multiplier bouncing all over the place, so I 'underclocked' the CPU to x12 instead of x16, and it seems to of solved the issue. I'm not sure how this fixes it... but It did =o**

[THE ISSUE (Reddit didn't wanna link)](https://imgur.com/JOHznwS)

Okay, hey guys, so I'm having an issue with my GTX 980, as are some others, and I just can't figure it out. It was working flawlessly a few days ago. #Sadface

This has happened before, I just switched the power cables to the ones provided with the GPU, and it was solved. But now it's back.


As you can see, there are multiple drops that keep reoccurring every X seconds. It happens in every game on any settings.

**Things I've tried so far:**

* Set Nvidia power settings to performance

* Set windows to performance

* Set pre-rendered frames to 3

* Turned off Vsync and put everything to low (still happens)

* Ran Microsoft Troubleshooter.... hah just kidding.

* Ran it at different resolutions

* Looked for Driver updates (even though it was working fine on the same update before)

* Running on Win 7 Aero

* Shut off services and processes that are not needed

* Full defrag on all hard drives (except SSD)

* Checked over wires, nothings lose

* Ran Windows 7 Disk searched for errors - none

* Removed recently installed programs

Extra note : Problem seemed to have started when the GPU crashed a few times on GTA (the system kept running, the GPU was turned off though, no signal.)
I'll post the solution when I figure out what's up, for anyone else having this issue.

*P.s. Razer Krappen 7.1s have ~~great~~ terrible audio quality. Don't buy. Would recommend anything other than a Kraken.*
