 My dad is getting rid of his Pioneer [SC-AK310 speaker system](http://welectronics.com/stereo/sc-ak310.jpg) for a newer upgrade. Could I connect a controller to these such as the DDJ-SX or DDJ-SR? What cable(s) would I need?  




 Definitely want to go darker, get to a darker brown like in [this](https://www.3wisemen.co.nz/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/6efaed196d6ddc33b03f911d25dbe699/b/t/bt1068_1.jpg) picture 




 Bought [this](http://i.imgur.com/cg6EaRz.jpg) leather belt today, got tricked by the lighting to make me think it was darker. What is a good way to darken it? Would oil rub off on the clothes I wear with it?
