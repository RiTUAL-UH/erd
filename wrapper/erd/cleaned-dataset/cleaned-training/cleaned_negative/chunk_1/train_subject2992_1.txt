 [Theory regarding what was happening to the baby:](#g "It would be interesting if the White Walkers could only turn dead people into Wights, however could turn living people into full-on White Walkers.") 




 Since Braavos shows up in the "Secrets" trailer and Ser Davos wrote a letter to the Iron Bank last episode; I'm presuming that is where he and Stannis will be heading to in the next two/three episodes.
