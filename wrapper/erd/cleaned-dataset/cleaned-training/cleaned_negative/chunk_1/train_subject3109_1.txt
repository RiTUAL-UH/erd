 Can we opt out? Or will this be forced on us like health care? 




 I'd bring it up and I'd offer to help him with writing up his will. Also I'd go with full disclosure with his kids about the contents of the will before he signs it. 




 Always work if you can, it never looks good to have dead time on your resume even if it means taking menial employment. I have had very positive feedback from potential employers for this and I believe because of my strong work ethic that I've beaten out people who were more qualified then I because they had long period of unaccounted time (unemployment) on their resumes. Any employment is a learning experience good or bad. I've never applied for unemployment, employers really like to hear that.

10,000 lbs?

Not much of a bunker, heck my driveway must weigh that much and it's only 20 foot long and maybe 3 " thick.

 Since you probably had the N1H1 flu you most likely now have swine flu antibodies would you take the swine flu shot if your Government made it mandatory? 




 No, as egomaniacs will suck up all the attention they can get. 




 How bad were the symptoms, a friend of mine says he had a high temp for 5 days and lost 15 lbs in one week, how did you fair? 




 You meet your dg and didn't kill it? Dude you're fu@ked!

 No he's a unemployment technician not a unemployed technician..

 Sweet! 




 Not really as I feel for the snake and the horrible death he's about to suffer trying to digest it... 




 I think he meant it as a joke, which didn't go over, so I guess we're suppose to down vote this.  




 Sure they would they're cops. And should you decide to engage in any type of illegal activities video recording it or posting details on the internet usually ends up badly for the poster, however the rest of us enjoy the read, so spill your guts!

 It depends on what type of web site you have if it's p0rn0 then let them in but if you running NORAD, SAC, or some other type of high value target web site then yes contact [HS](http://www.dhs.gov/xutil/contactus.shtm). 




 What is done with the pace maker are they recycled or destroyed? 




 Do you run a metal detector over the body to look for such items as a pace maker or metal pins or rods before the cremation. I would think it would be foolish to cremate the remains with any valuable recyclable items.   




 I've heard that gold teeth are harvested... any truth to this either by relatives or Embalmers? 




 *This was a test and you passes.*

I believe you are a Mortician as I've never met one who had a sense of humor you are all very stoic which would seem to be a requirement of the position.

 Also do you know any ways (trade secrets) to prevent Zombies from rising from the grave? 




 How do you deal with a diseased or contagious corpse? 




 Can I just use a 4A and a 3A fuse in parallel instead? Also, I'm just curious...would two 

No because the 3 amp will still blow at 3 amps of current. 




 You did the right thing as lying about your intentions isn't going to get you anything but trouble in the relationship. If she cares enough about you she'll come around and she'll know where you stand. If she doesn't come around then move on. 




 I noticed that too, 'webcams' is quite the dead reddit. 




 Prime Minister Donald Tusk said late last year he wanted obligatory castration for pedophiles, whom he branded 'degenerates'. Tusk said he did not believe "one can use the term 'human' for such individuals, such creatures."

Wow that's just how I feel about Politicians...

 No it just means ether way you're going to hell... 




 Name the baby 'Reddit'.

You've been anal probed I can tell by your discourse. 




 Thank you bud! 




 I have attached an image

 Stay at Di66, pretend you're at reddit, eventually you'll become disgusted enough you'll rip out your modem, problem solved. 




 As far as I'm concerned Costner sleeps with the fishies. So... wrinkly.

 What is it you don't feel? 

When I inhale / exhale I don't feel anything the only time I can think of when I've felt my lungs was holding my breath for a long time, having a infection in the lungs, breathing freezing air, smoking.

 I'm in Florida where the Pay Day operations are heavily regulated and controlled by the state. However I've never used them, but what you describe in Canada would make me think twice about using them. 




 ($30) per session for being a sperm donor and that you could go 4-5 times a month. 

Getting payed and a hand-job what's not to like about this? And just think how much you save by not hooking up with the local working girls. 




 If your state (if you live in the states that is) has a Pay Day loan type operation you can borrow $400.00 for two week with a pay back of around $45.00 which is less the the $200.00 late fee. Some pawn shop loan also but this all depends where you live. 




 Nice.

 I had my head slammed into a locker by a 8th grade teacher after that I never dissed a teacher. Sometimes you need a attitude adjustment however I never had a school cop smack me around and I'm not sure that's what the law should be doing.  




 Check for DNA scrape it off and replicate the guy then raise his child to love reddit and when the clone reaches about 18 years of age mail him back to his parent. 




 You're doing a great job and deserve a $10K bonus! 




 Careful about posting defamatory complaints directed at huge corporations. I'm still trying to find out what happened to the redditor who posted the $ears thread. 




 Granted when shooting at a mass or crowds of zombies you would definitely want automatic weapons but for your run of the mill 4 to 8 zombies trying to bust into your house a short barrel pump action is sufficient and quite fun actually.    




 As long as they blow off Zombies heads I'm sure either will work well, just remember to aim for the brains... However I'd want a pump for reliability as you don't get a second chance with Zombies.

 And I'm not a IT person. 




 Yes I did, that's not the point. The point was his IT boss didn't seem to know he could have just looked it up rather then show ignorance in a subject he should be proficient in.

 Thousands of dollars in Alcohol?

Maybe if you're drinking Gran Patrn Platinum but 80oz of beer ain't that expensive. And anything against your body will tend to get body temperature fairly quick which would tend to make most alcohols not very tasty except maybe brandy. However I think I would go with the Beerbelly mainly because I live in the south and a fat gut would not be out of place at most events. 




 Thanks, interesting take on the situation and fairly accurate.

 Thanks for the link, looks worthy of my PC's down time. 




 RX's are better but only for being what they're advertised to be chemically where as street drugs are what ever the basement chemist put into it to manufacture it. However I agree that RX's are as dangerous as uncontrolled street drugs primarily due to misuse and big pharm company greed. And I don't know why you were down voted as your inquiries were reasonable.  




 I'm not sure from the document you cite how you've come to conclude this. 




 I get my drugs legally from my Dr *just like Michael*.

This was my attempt showing that point.

So I agree with you. 




 I've never taken street manufactured drugs mainly due to the lack of oversight and quality control in the manufacturing, I get my drugs legally from my Dr just like Michael . My brother in-law died from a hot shot of street heroin.  If something doesn't feel right don't do it. 




 It really depresses me when people don't post a link to the story their citing...bad attempt at humor  




 You sure this is the right video? I'm seeing a video about why girls don't fart.

 These guys should fry, I await the DA's decision... 
Then I'll pass judgment on Hollywood Fl

I too once while stopped at red street light was rear ended by a drunk judge from another state when I told the cop I thought the man was drunk due to the over whelming stench of booze the cop told me to shut the fuck up and go sit on the curb or he'd arrest me and have the state take my son, which was quite a shock to my 5 year old son who was in my arms at the time, but other then that experience I respect the law.

Try yelling homo at someone riding a motorcycle you'll get a ass whooping. That is unless they're on a Honda.
