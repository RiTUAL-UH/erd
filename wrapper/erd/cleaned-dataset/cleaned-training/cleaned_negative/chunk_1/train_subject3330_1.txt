 Other than the cutscenes stuttering the game is ace. 




 Yeah Queens Wrath was a joke, same content just re-skined pink. Same story missions re-purposed... The Queen requests kills, so go do this completely unrelated story mission. Makes no sense Bungie.

Haven't even tried Iron Banner, not even going to bother... The only thing that made me even remotely interested in the event was that gear and lvl actually matter... Seeing as thats not the case, I really dont care enough to try it. 




 I was watching your movements to see if they match on screen and it's surprisingly accurate. 

Going to try this out tonight. 




 The Hulk was French? 




 Except when you try to use the sprint so you can slide... and it doesnt work... you just walk forwards and crouch like a dumb arse.

Thats why this cooldown annoys me. 




 Tell me about it, the amount of times I've gone to sprint and slide in for a melee kill only to wind up walking forward and crouching...

 Obligatory:

[EVERYONE!](http://i.imgur.com/bot0NQ9.gif) 




 Id do it Sunday so it's ready for everyone going to work Monday. 

But that's because I'm a prick. 




 Looks to be the same size, full version should be an unlock.  




 Should now be working, if anything like Australia that is. 

Just started downloading here. 




 Why can't I pre load? I pre-ordered as soon as it became available on PSN specifically so I could pre load and play it a bit the night it comes out...

Guess I won't be doing that seeing as we're now down to 4 hours till release and still no pre load available.

I'm going to take a wild guess here... it's because im in Australia right?

*edit* 

Great, after complaining it now starts to download. 




 Op pls, I'll be waiting. 




 Reminds me of the short film [The Awareness](http://vimeo.com/82527075) 




 [The End?](http://i.imgur.com/JCpgIyT.jpg) 




 Reminds me of Tales From The Crypt: [Only skin deep.](http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjIxNjgxNTM1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDQ4MTU2MjE@._V1_SY317_CR104,0,214,317_AL_.jpg) (Se6Ep02) 




 The box around their level will be / flash yellow when they have a super ready.

This can save your life in PVP, remember this. 




 This. I cant believe other people havent noticed this.... Or the fact their LVL will glow / flash yellow when their super is ready. 




 [Nothing special](http://www.bungie.net/en/Legend/2/4611686018428942993/2305843009214944103#gear) 




 Yeah I got [Skull Of Dire Ahamkara](http://destiny.wiki.fextralife.com/Skull+of+Dire+Ahamkara) from him a week or so ago. 




 Get Vanguard / Crucible to Rank 2+ and spend your hard earned marks on the gear you and need.

Work for the gear you want and you will have it. 




 Spawns at regular intervals at set locations on the map sure, but which one of those locations is random? 

I'm happy to be wrong though.  




 Special ammo sould be like heavy, limited / random spawns and you lose it if you die.

It won't stop the abuse but it'll cut it down a bit.  




 I doubt the tradition let alone knowledge of Halloween would have survived hundreds of years after the collapse of human civilization...

But hey, I could be wrong. 




 All the time, same with the PS Store just loading a blue screen with O in the bottom corner. 




 1.5 Million non-biodegradable balloons released.

Because fuck nature for a short spectacle right? 




 Destiny, your character, the events in the game... It's all a Vex simulation...

The Grimoire cards for the Vex detail how the VEX are running simulations of reality to better understand and predict human behavior in order to preempt our actions. 

One of the cards calls them the Architects.

While playing the game and you die, if you look in the top right you can sometimes see your cause of death as "The Architects"

Meaning you are indeed inside the Vex simulation and your life was part of the simulation where you failed.

You come back to life because they reload the simulation /  it cuts to another simulation to see what the outcome could have been.

Seeing as the Vex operate out of space and time for all we know everything including your initial resurrection has not happened yet or may never happen... It's just a simulation of one possible outcome.

TL;DR, You're in the matrix.
 




 The Ghostless Guardians, they know whats really happening in the grand scheme of things. They're following you, waiting for the right time to bring you into the fold... to bring the Traveler down.

*dun dun dun*

Nah, I have no idea haha. 




 Because Sharknado had an estimated budge of: $1,000,000.

Meanwhile Dredd has the estimated budget of: $50,000,000.

So why not make a second Sharknado, or 50 for the same price as a "big budget" flick that people want to see? Even if it is only to say they've seen it or like it ironically... 














 Think about it, he looks the same, acts the same and he disappears then reappears like magic always with something new to sell...same as Merchant.

Also thanks to Las Plagas he's able to live for centuries, unfortunately for  Xur though Las Plagas has left him all Cthulhu faced.

Thoughts? Complaints? Agreements? 




 So as expected there's a few already a few up on ebay at the low low price between $400 to $500+

So if there's anyone out there that desperate for one... I say wait haha. 














 So I got around to watching [The dark backward](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101660/) last night and am now looking for similar movies that have a grimy, bleak feeling too it.

The only other movies I can think of that compare are 

[Bad Boy Bubby](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106341/?ref_=nv_sr_1)

and

[Gummo](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119237/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1)


They're intriguing in a weird sort of way, so pass me any other movies you may know in the same vein as above! 

















































 After re-watching the Pokemon series Se01-Ep09 I have come to the conclusion that all the Pokemon games are not real events and are Games/simulations created by the Pokmon Technical Institute in the Pokemon Universe itself.

In the episode: Se01-Ep09 - The School of Hard Knocks. The Students refer to Pokemons Lvls, experience, and when/how they will evolve based on this information, same as the game. As far as I remember they never mention Pokemon in this manner ever again except in the games themselves.

Then they show the Pokemon battle simulator, which is an almost exact replica of the actual Pokemon games battle system.

So my theory is that in the Pokemon universe the Pokemon Technical Institute created the games as a Pokemon trainer simulator based on their research and their battle simulator. They released it as a training simulator to help up and coming trainers learn about pokemon etc. 

This is also supported by the 4th wall comments in some of the games from the Dev team.
such as:

* "I'm the game designer!"

* "I wrote the story!"

* "I'm the graphic artist! I drew you!" or "I'm the graphic designer! I'm a skilled dot artist!"

* "Me? I'm the programmer!".

None of it is real, it's all a game within the Pokemon universe itself.

Or something...

*EDIT*: 

The games have some semblance to the real Pokemon world with the characters and locations etc.
It also makes sense to add Team Rocket and other real world events to show the dangers and characters you'd meet in each region. 
All the while telling a game story thats unrelated to the real world.

 Howdy all,  

Recently back in Melbourne after backpacking around Murica for a couple of months, I've scored a job doing outbound cold calling for funeral insurance and needless to say it bites the big one haha.

I have 6 of years experience with Telcos, customer service, tech support, provisioning and more. 

Sooooo anyone here work in any call centers that know of any positions available, possibly pass on my cv?

I've been on seek and Gumtree religiously the last couple of weeks and had no luck so I figured why not see if anyone here can help me get a foot in the door. 

Thanks in advance if anyone can help. 




 Howdy all, I was recently over in NZ and a friend gave me a PSN card as a going away gift... But seeing as my account is an AUS account I have no use for it..

So I pretty much have a free $30 NZ PSN credit voucher available to give away.

If you have a NZ account and want this credit all you have to do is simply guess the  digit/letter where the "*"is in the code and it's yours!

"*"MQD - D6N9 - GB4A

Best of luck and enjoy


UPDATE: Code has been redeemed buy u/adelope, congratulations! 




 My vita has been stuck on NAT3 since I got the thing and can't play anything online.

I've already tried every option regarding port forwarding for the specific games and PSN itself, I've also set a static ip for the vita. 

I was looking through the firewall settings on the Thomson tg782t router and noticed some options for dmz but everything I've tried doesn't seem to work and I lost all Internet connectivity on all devices... which was resolved once I deleted the settings. 

So is there anyone out there that has the same router and knows enough to set up dmz for a specific ip without breaking the entire network itself? 

Or should I just give up and buy an actual good router instead? 














 Howdy all, I've been playing on and off for a year or so, but never put in any real time or effort... I want to change that haha.

I'll be moving back to Melbourne within the next week odd and was wondering if anyone on here either plays the ol' blues harp and is willing to teach a beginner a few things. Or if anyone knows of any decent priced places that provide harmonica lessons? 

I did have a quick look online but I'm not sure where to start or who/where would be good. 

Any advice is appreciated. 

Cheers 




 Morning all! Just arrived in your fine city 30 odd minutes ago, have nothing planned for the day so thought I'd try to annoy fellow redditors.

If anyone isn't doing anything later today feel free to hit me up, we can go grab a beer or something. I'll be chilling around central park mostly.

Oh and this city is massive by the way, beyond my expectations haha. 




 We get it, Microsoft has changed their drm and online policies. 

Stop posting it as new news when it's been posted every damn 5 seconds for the last hour. 




 Hey all, what's there to do and see over here while visiting for a few weeks? 

I also saw a thread a while back for the global meet up but the was no follow up/confirmation on the location, any updates on that? 




 So who wants to help arrange the (first?) Palmy global meet -up? If no one, I can do it myself haha. 

It's as easy as confirming how many people are going to show then booking a venue!

So who's interested? Suggestions and ideas? 




 I know palmy is small an all, but surely there must be redditers out there to keep this sub active? 














 It arrived at my local store today so I caved in and bought it... I know I could have imported it bla bla bla 

All i'll say is, it better be good since all I've heard the last couple of months is constant praise and adoration from everyone and their dogs... 

Though I have a feeling I'm going to be severely underwhelmed.

Either way I will be back to give my impression of the game... positive or negative. 




 Afternoon all, 

Sorry for the slow update regarding this... but ya'll know how it is.
The event will be held at [Dash Paintball](http://www.dashpaintball.com.au/front1.html)

Right now Im looking to collect the names and numbers of all that will be attending so I can book in the preferred date and arrange the transport.

So if you are interested throw me a message with your name, number and preferred date for the event.
(I will be going through the old thread and messaging those who said they were interested for confirmation as well.)

I look forward to seeing how many are still interested, hopefully enough to make two teams for a days worth of paintballing awesomeness!

[In case you missed it, here is the original thread.](http://www.reddit.com/r/perth/comments/13cj78/rperth_paintball_meet_up/) 




 Sooo... I hear the world is going to end this coming friday? Something about a Mayan calendar prediction?  *shrugs*
Either way, its a good excuse as any to have a pool party!

So in saying that, If no one has plans for the coming apocalypse why not spend it drinking MaiTais, listening to some music while relaxing in or beside a pool? There may even be a BBQ!

I live central east perth, most know that already but for those that do not, throw me a PM for more details / address etc.

Oh and limited drinks will be supplied but I recommended BYO just incase. 














 Anyone else notice this? She is completely irrational and unpredictable, her actions towards the Governor have little to no justification or motivation other than she gets a bad vibe from him... And I mean Rick has treated her worse than the Gov ever did... with her personality she wouldn't let that slide, but this fact will be completely ignored for the sake of the story progressing. 

Hell I wouldn't have her around my group incase someone accidentally gave her a wrong look, shed prob off them then disappear into the woods.

At least in the comic she had a damn good reason for doing what she did.
In the show... she's a paranoid mute clusterfuck with a sword...
So far tv Michonne has been a disappointment, other than being fan service for sword zombie kills she's near useless. 




 Sooo it's me again haha.


I was wondering if there are enough people interested in a Paintball meet up... hopefully there are enough people interested to make up two teams. (you can even make your own team names or logo!)
I think minimum team size should be 4 so we can have a few matches 4 vs 4 but would prefer teams of 6 -8


It will of course be held on a weekend, the date is open and likely not to be till after christmas / new years as most people will have their calendar full at this time of the year. 
I'm just getting in early to see what number of people I can expect before making bookings and everything.


If I can guarantee enough people I will arrange transport to and from the paintball grounds. (I'll rent out a Van or two for the day)


The only expense you will have to cover is the standard fees for the Paintballing itself, usually between $30 to $70+ depending on the amount of paintballs you require.


I was thinking of this location / company for the event:http://www.wasppaintball.com.au/

Unless anyone knows of any others they prefer?


And for the alcoholics among us, I will try to arrange post drinks back in the city somewhere (most likely at Moon   Sixpence) where we can get drunk and regale on the events of the day. 

I would really like to make this into a proper event, make a day out of it, the winning team will even get a Trophy!

Thoughts?
Good idea, bad idea? 




 Howdy all!

Hope everyone is taking advantage of this amazing weather and is getting out and about, not locking themselves indoors on Reddit like myself.

I'm bored and have nothing to do, so it's either loiter around the in city, head to a beach, stay at home or Go Carting!

Anyone interested in coming along? I guess 3-4 people would make it more interesting. 

The only place I know of is in Belmont:
http://www.kartworldbelmont.com.au/
(8 Cowcher Place Belmont WA 6104)

If interested let me know.

*EDIT*
For those interested we'll get this started in about an hour. 1:30pm
So anyone who wants to tag along simply show up at Kartworld around that time.

We of course wont be able to race straight away and will be waiting in the queue so there will be plenty of time for any late comers to slip in.

*Double Edit*
Those who are responsable adults can get there easily with cars, those like me using public transport it will take roughly 40 mins from the city centre and a bit of a walk... just an FYI
 




 Sooo I caved and decided to buy the retail version rather than digital and I tell you what, I am happy I did.. at least now I can return it...

First of all it doesnt require an online pass so this is a major plus for those who may want to share/trade the game with friends.

Now onto my first experience with the online side of the game... I'm yet to be able join a game past the loading screen.
In essence the exact same issues that plagued Resistance: Burning Skies online multiplayer are still present.

The game goes to join, shows matched players and then begins to load... aaaaand then booted back to the main menu, I have repeated this time and time again only to have the same thing, this is present regardless of the game type I choose.(I have rebooted the Vita, double checked my network/router setting and everything is perfect)

So either the servers are at capacity at the moment or the game really is a simple reskin of R:BS, multiplayer issues and all.

In saying that, I'm willing to wait a week incase a patch is released or it is simply the servers being overloaded.

Am I the only one experiencing this issue?


(Side note: My connection is more than adequate for playing online, especially for handheld gaming, I am also on NAT2 on my Vita yet I am unable to join a single game... those familiar with trying to join a game in Burning skies both pre and post patch will know what I mean.) 




 Yeah you, in the tank....

Just finished watching Se1Ep1: Days gone by again, so damn good.
Its amazing to see how the show has changed, in pace, characters and their development, hell even the walkers have changed from being hinted as retaining some of their former self (the walker girl at the start picking up her stuffed toy, the wife trying to open the door) to being shown as mindelss drones.

that's it, just stopping by to see if we can get some discussion going on for probably the best pilot episode for any show ive ever seen. XD 




 Ladies and gentlemen, (and gingers)

The night has arrived, we'll kick things off from 6ish onwards.
I've decided not to decorate the place, too much effort haha.

There will be drinks and snacks / food, but feel free to bring your own if you wish.
Also movies, bring any you wish to share, or a hard driveif you just want to show up to pillage other peoples haha.

Seeing as it is still a halloween / horror themed night, dressing up will be encouraged,  but I have a feeling many people will not. 




 So im watching it for the first time as I type this and my god, Christian Bale, the man commits to every role he takes on doesn't he.
He was near unrecognizable at first, how on earth did he lose so much weight, just skin and bones...

Oh and the movies good so far, not sure why I waited this long to watch it. 




 The night of Friday the 2nd of November has been decided upon as the night for the movie night.
The night will start from say... 6-7pm and go for as long as people are willing to stay.

Bring movies, bring food, bring drinks, or simply just bri g yourself.

To those still interested either post here or PM me and I will reply with the address etc.

Also, will people be making an effort to dress up?
No pressure, not expecting anyone to. 




 Ladies and Gentlemen, 

I present to you a proposition of sorts.

I have been over in Melbourne the last few weeks and will be back in mid next week, as such I would like to arrange a Reddit movie night!

On the 26th of October or the 2nd Of November I would like to host a Horror movie marathon in honour of the night that is all Hallows Eve.
(or the 31st if enough Halloween purists are out there)

- Location: East Perth, Central City at my place.
Enough for 6 people on couches, plus more on various seats.
- Dress code: Casual but dressing up is encouraged.
- Drinks: Will be supplied, beer that is, possibly a ghoulish punch of whatever I find to mix at the time. (Or you can hit one of the three bottle store nearby)

Movie selection will be strictly horror, or any film that induces fear... (Yes Deaditor that includes Spice Girls.)

This will only go ahead if I know for certain enough people will show up.
So I know how much effort or if any effort to put into making this  happen. (decorations etc)

So what say you?
If interested let me know and I'll pass on more details. 














 Deaditor and I are out and about at Fibber McGees in Leederville, if anyone out there is bored and feel like a few cold drinks on this fantastic afternoon.
The more the merrier as they say.

If you show up, we're out back, just look for the odd ones out from the footy fans. 














 So I'm on my way to work and theyre setting up some thing for qutting smoking, seems to be a good 10 - 15 race cars.
Does anyone else find it amusing that they would try to help people quit by using cars to pump out noxious fumes?

Its like *here, quit smoking and breath this in instead*

Thats all, if anyone is in the city during the day have a look. 




 Howdy again all,

Since my last attempt at a movie night failed miserably, thought I'd try again this weekend.

Aaaaaand it also turns out this Friday is Friday the 13th, if no one has any plans(curse you folks who know of the dress up parties) I propose a horror movie marathon!
Same details as before, location is central east perth, 2 couchs that should seat about 6, bottle store across the road, bring your own snacks (though pizza being delivered is a very likely possibility)

Basically looking to have a few people over, drink and watch bad movies till he early hours.
Bonus points for keeping the neighbours awake as well.

If interested send me a message, oh and if not enough people show interest I'll call it off and also stop asking haha.
(hoping for at least 3 to 4 people to make it entertaining) 




 Howdy all, 

I know this may be late notice but anyone up or a movie night tonight? 
I have no plans and don't feel like going anywhere... so I thought I'd try to drag you guys here XD

the movie night will be at my place over in east perth, central city so its easy to get to.

I have 2 couchs so could seat 6 or so people.(they fold out to beds if required)
Bottle store across the road for any alcoholics that need their medicine XD

I have quite a selection of movies ranging from classics to downright abominations....

If interested shoot me a message, I only ask that you bring snacks and any movies you might want to watch, oh and that your not a troublemaker of course.
(also, I heard there was a snes at notsosillynorwegians movie night? Well I don't have one, only a ps3... but if anyone wants bring one, by all means)

On that note, I look forward to hearing how many/if any are interested, can reschedule for next week if need be.


*Edit*
so this has be rescheduled for next weekend.
If still interested send me a message and ill get back to you with the address etc.
 



















 So a new cheat has been found for Unit 13,  while in a mission press:

up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, X, O.

It's a variation of the Konami code and it changes the screen filter i.e: lowers the resolution so it looks like doom, inverts the colours, makes it look like ink drawn on white paper etc.... basically keep putting it in to change the look of the game, there's a good 5 or 6 variations.

Also, anyone know how to get the dancing and other hidden trophy? 




 Sooo, has anyone else noticed there's pretty much nothing coming out until mid/late may?
Guess I'll have to replay my current games. 




 Hi Perth Redditers!

Im not sure if you can help, and im sure you get quite a few of these posts on here... but I am in dire straights at the moment and desperately looking for work. So I thought I'd try all avenues, cant hurt right?
I've already done the usual, seek, Gumtree, Hays etc to no avail...


So a bit about myself, im 26, from NZ although I have been in Melbourne for about 5 years or so.
All my previous work experience has been call centre based, fully trained, cert 3 in telecomunications,  cert in QA, training in conflict / dispute management. 
Each position was either Customer Service or Technical support / helpdesk roles.
I have a very professional phone manner, excellent time management skills and high attention to details, proficient in many systems.


Sooooo, if anyone knows of anything along those lines that may not be found in the usual channels to job seekers, as ya know, its often who you know, not what you know.

Or if anyone knows of any positions available doing absolutely anything ill take it...
washing Cars? ill take it.
laying bricks, ill take it.
handing out flyers, ill take it.


As long as its not illegal im willing to do it.

Again not expecting much, but its worth a try right?
Thanks for the time anyone out there may have put in just reading this... even bigger thanks and even a beer for anyone who can help out.
