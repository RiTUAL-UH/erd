 I stand corrected, but your post is still a duplicate of

 President Obama exchanged emails with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton at her private address -- @clintonemail.com -- but did not know the details of her account or how she would comply with administration policy and federal records law, the White House said today.

White House says Obama unaware of the details of her personal email address and private server, nor how her team will comply with the Federal Records Act

 Just to be clear, you are saying that "x broken again" is unacceptable, yes?

it would be if it were the 10th iteration of the same bug in a short period of time, posted to /firefox for the 10th time,  yes. 

How would you feel if it were a PSA? "PSA: x broken again."

shrug, if it's a recurrence of an old bug in a new version of firefox then it would probably be worthwhile 

It's not how **I** feel, the community generally lets it's voice known on the quality of a post/comment in here :) 




 quick stats for ya, in the last 13 DAYS this sub has only attracted 25 posts that warranted removal, be it from spam, shadow-banned users, or manually-removed troll comments. From someone who moderates ~40 subreddits, that is OUTSTANDING. I've just enabled our traffic stats for the nerds

http://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/about/traffic/ 




  In this scenario, "x broken again" would be acceptable?

no, but on the other hand, we shouldn't denigrate less knowledgeable users who ask "x doesn't work, how can I fix it", even if the fix has been posted multiple times (let's face it, NOBODY uses reddit's search feature for such things, especially a n00b).  




  As far as I can see there are no posted rules in this subreddit.

because it's a small community of like-minded citizens,   we're happy to stay that way. I mod multiple subreddits, some are dedicated to growth, this isn't, it's a niche, mods   subscribers like it that way. I handle the small amount of spam that comes in here, antabaka is the genius responsible for the UI, it works, shrug.  














 we aim to please :) 









 if they break our rules report 'em   we'll delete 'em :) 


































  Windows 10 is free for everyone as far as I know.

  I know you. Chill out. You're not cancer. You're the backbone of reddit.

check's in the mail 




 You're actually alright.

thank you, contrary to Ransal's belief, we mods (in the main) just give up our time to help improve reddit in our own little way. These little dramas aren't even worthy of attention generally

 Maybe the janitor.

Capital J please :) I used to like to think so, now it's just a nickname/joke that has stuck 

http://i.imgur.com/lJmWQgW.png 




 you REALLY need to get a life :) 




  and no, you dont get browny points for not removing a comment that didnt break the rules in the first place. youre bad and stupid 

your eloquence is underwhelming 




  Maybe jumped the ban trigger too quickly but

not so, you're unaware of the back-story, the users' previous modmails in /wtf, /creepy   /gifs etc, this was in NO way jumping the gun. In fact (sigh, I generally don't even respond to these pathetic witch-hunts, but here we go), when he first disputed a post removal in /creepy (a post that was NOT removed), he sent me a PM, even though I had nothing to do with the issue at that point,   I looked into it   politely tried to help him out:

http://i.imgur.com/x0n8CiB.png

didn't work. Notice his insistence that I am actually a dummy account for admin, oh I wish :) And his refusal to believe his post in /creepy was NOT removed, despite multiple mods/screenshots being provided as proof. His paranoia   accusations that mods are liars, in a conspiracy to silence him   so on followed him from that point. I would never have even been involved in any of this if HE had not contacted ME 

 




 every time you try to demean me you lose, so much so you can't even reply to proof of your mistaken beliefs   acknowledge your error:

  Broken Link  




 the firefox addon "downloadhelper" works on that file 




  Broken Link  




 yeah I get that, it's just annoying multiple times daily :( Could the system not clear the "note" field for us when it sends that message, THEN we would be aware and would only have to click "ban" again? 




 either a revert, or, simply change what the mod sees when he clicks "ban". If the note needs to be removed, don't make the mod do it, simply remove it on the back-end   action the ban 




 mmm, I thought it sounded a fair exchange myself 




 http://i.imgur.com/IJwPfwI.png 




   looks like it does what you need. It may do silly things if you're using Removal Reasons for comments.

I'll look into it, cheers, I don't use reasons on comments, I use flairs. 

Edit: that script does nothing at all afaik 




 I'm no coder, just an end-user :) My workaround is 2 firefox profiles, 1 with modtools installed, for my initial daily logon, where the "y/n" removal is a BOON for prowling all my /new lists for violations,   the 2nd profile has toolbox installed, because toolbox handles auto-bans, "queue-tools"   so on much better than modtools (which is pretty broken). Sadly the 2 don't interact together peaceably, FF slows to a CRAWL if I install toolbox alongside modtools, hence the 2 profiles 




 very stupid idea...IF you are genuine you are opening your SO to all manner of trolling  abuse, rendering his new phone-number useless

  better install chrome before i kill myself then.

hahaha it's only a browser man, lighten up :) Iirc the problem is firefox reports you have the correct/latest flash but you don't. Grab a clean installer for flash from

http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/otherversions/

uninstall old version, install that latest version, done 




 there are known problems with flash installs in ff, search the subreddit

  Actually I was suggesting that upvotes be taken into account when banning people

problem with that is that it is easily rigged, clone accounts, sockpuppets etc, we've seen it all before, too many times. Here's a recent one I sent to admin

http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/2uouse/where_is_entrence_to_the_mario_bross_world/

http://i.imgur.com/zxWAabh.png


every commenter is a 1/0 clone account,   I believe the post got something like 15 or 35 upvotes in minutes, a clumsy attempt at vote-rigging
 




  I'm saying you ban people who post a lot of stuff that isn't upvoted.

that's ludicrous   untrue. No mod bans someone simply because they consistently get get downvoted. Keeping on-topic, mods ban people for promoting their own agenda. Nobody begrudges a REDDITOR asking the community to take a look at their site, but if your intent when creating a reddit account is to promote your own content you're a spammer, not a redditor. By the way, you fail the litmus test:

   If the only way to not be a spammer in these communities is posting shitlinks, maybe you are a spammer and should not be on reddit.

+1, this:

If over 10% of your submissions **and conversation** are your own site/content/affiliate links, you're almost certainly a spammer.

was a ludicrous addition to the FAQ? "And conversation", WTH is that supposed to mean? Feel free to submit 10 post from "myblog.com", it's OK because you have made 200 comments to counterbalance it ? Snort. 10:1 ratio ftw

 




 I rarely comment on these issues, been there done that, it's a no-win debate, but creech has it bang on here, I coincidentally advised a new user today:

http://i.imgur.com/DsGefXt.png

organic growth is the key,   a startup throwing itself against the firewall of subreddits like /r/funny is BOUND to fail. A whitelist is safer than a blacklist 




 I prefer turtles
