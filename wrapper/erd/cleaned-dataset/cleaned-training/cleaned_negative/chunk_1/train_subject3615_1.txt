 This article in the *Washington Free Beacon* was the only source of info (all other articles merely repeated the vague details from the Free Beacon)

http://freebeacon.com/national-security/cia-official-dies-in-apparent-suicide/

Even stranger still was the TIMING of the release of the article: 11:46 PM on a Friday night. It was also just one day after the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence had voted to release the $40 million Torture Report which looked into CIA actions in the post-9/11 era. There was also some hearings on Benghazi that week as well...

So NO ONE at any news organization has been able to follow-up on this in the past month? 


 












































 Very suspicious timing for release of this info as well--article was published at 11:46 on a Friday evening...All follow-up articles were derived from this original Washington Free Beacon article and no other info has been published--**no name/age/sex of victim, no date or time of death, no location of incident, no official cause of death**...

A senior CIA official has died in an apparent suicide this week from injuries sustained after jumping off a building in northern Virginia, according to sources close to the CIA.

CIA spokesman Christopher White confirmed the death and said the incident did not take place at CIA headquarters in McLean, Va.

We can confirm that there was an individual fatally injured at a facility where agency work is done, White told the Washington Free Beacon. He was rushed to a local area hospital where he subsequently died. Due to privacy reasons and out of respect for the family, we are not releasing additional information at this time.

A source close to the agency said the man who died was a middle manager and the incident occurred after the man jumped from the fifth floor of a building in Fairfax County.

Many agency employees are known to work under stressful conditions and high stress is considered a part of the profession, for the three general types of employees: Intelligence analysts and support personnel, technical services operators, and members of the clandestine services, the agencys elite spying branch.

The CIA is known to operate or rent space in a number of semi-secret locations in the country, including at least one high-rise building in Tysons Corner.

The agency also operates a number of top-secret facilities used by its clandestine service officers, including agency safe houses.

No other details of the death could be learned.

The agency is currently engaged in a high profile dispute with the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.

Sen. Diane Feinstein (D., Calif.), chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, has said the CIA has blocked efforts by the committee to investigate harsh interrogation of terrorists.

Committee staff members working at a CIA facility in Northern Virginia to investigate agency interrogation practices also have charged that the CIA covertly searched the agencys computers that were being used in the investigation.

The agency subsequently reported that several Senate staff members had improperly and possibly illegally removed classified material from the CIA. The FBI was asked to investigate the mishandling of classified information in the case.

The agency is under pressure from Congress to declassify a 6,000-page report on agency interrogation techniques, including waterboarding, used to glean information from al Qaeda terrorists captured after the 2001 attacks on Washington and New York.

The agency also this week came under scrutiny from the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence over the agencys role in obscuring the facts surrounding the Sept. 11, 2012 terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya.

Former CIA Deputy Director Michael Morrell told the committee that agency analysts concluded that a protest took place in advance of the attack that killed four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens.

Morrell testified that subsequent information revealed this judgment to be incorrect.

The CIA was operating a facility in Benghazi with a large number of agency personnel whose activities had not been made public.

Speculation about the CIA annex in Benghazi has focused on the agencys role in supplying weapons to Libyan militias that in turn were shipping the arms to Islamist rebels in Syria.

 According to Daniel Ellsbergs *SECRETS: A Memoir of Vietnam and the Pentagon Papers* (2002):

However, in the fall of 1961 a highly secret, dramatically revised national intelligence estimate turned the strategic world that had preoccupied me for three years upside down. The missile gap favoring the Soviets had been a fantasy. There was a gap, all right, but it was currently ten to one in our favor. Our 40 Atlas and Titan ICBMs were matched by 4 Soviet SS-6 ICBMs at one launching site at Plesetsk, not by 120, as in the latest national estimate in June, or by the SAC commanders estimate of 1,000 I had heard of at SAC headquarters in August. The specter of a deliberate Soviet surprise attack suddenly appeared, with the new estimates, to have been a chimera. 

...the new estimate was kept effectively secret from Congress, the press, and the public, and it had a comparably imperceptible effect on military programs. It was after this secret recognition that the Soviets  had deployed four liquid-fueled ICBMs to our forty that the Kennedy administration decided, in the late fall of 1961, on the appropriate size for the projected force of U.S. solid-fueled Minuteman missiles: one thousand. That was less than the 1,600 to 6,000 that the air force had earlier requested, but it was down only to the level that Secretary McNamara had earlier decided on *before* the new estimate. (pages 32-33)

**THREAT INFLATION**

------------------------

The 6 paragraphs below are taken from Chapter 7 of a free online book *The Pentagon Labyrinth* (2011). Full article "Follow the Money" by Andrew Cockburn (2011): http://pogoarchives.org/labyrinth/07-cockburn-w-covers.pdf

------------------------------

Recall that following victory in World War II, the U.S. rapidly disarmed, disbanding its huge conscript army and slashing weapons production. The economies of our allies and enemies in the recent conflict lay in total ruin. Although the Soviet Union controlled eastern European states overrun by the Red Army during the war, this was by prior agreement with the U.S. and Britain. Suddenly, in the spring of 1948, senior officials of the Truman Administration suddenly began issuing ominous warnings that the Soviet Union was bent on war and might attack at any time. A warning to that effectwar could come at any timewas solicited by the chief of army intelligence from the U.S. commander in Germany, General Lucius Clay, and duly leaked to the press.

Why?

The answer is clear for anyone who remembers to follow the money. The aircraft corporations who had garnered enormous profits during the war on the back of government contracts had discovered by 1947 that **peace was ruinous**. Despite initial high hopes, the commercial marketplace was proving a far harsher and less accommodating environment than that of wartime, especially as there were far more companies than required by the peacetime economy. Orders from the civilian airline industry never lived up to expectations while efforts to diversify into other products, including dishwashers and stainless steel coffins, proved disappointing and costly.

Something had to be done. In the spring of 1948 senior officials in the Truman Administration, including Secretary of Defense James Forrestal, suddenly began warning that the Soviets were on the brink of unleashing a surprise military attack against Western Europe. There was **no evidence** that the Soviets had any such intentions, a point, as declassified documents now make clear, that was well known to the senior officials. In fact Stalin, the Soviet leader, was enjoining the powerful western European communist parties from any revolutionary action and refusing to aid the Greek communists in their civil war against the U.S.-backed government.

This cause (need for stimulus in the aerospace industry) and effect (war scare leading to sharp increase in defense appropriations) was pithily summed up at the time by Lawrence D. Bell, President of the Bell Aircraft Corporation: As soon as there is a war scare, there is a lot of money available. And so it proved. The aircraft procurement budget soared **57**% as the overall Pentagon procurement budget exploded by almost **600** percent from less than $6 billion in 1947 to more than $35 billion in 1948 (in contemporary 2011 dollars). The industry, not to mention powerful institutions linked to its fortunes, such as **major banks**, was saved from collapse.

Apart from a brief relapse pending the outbreak of the Korean war in 1950, war scares, otherwise known as **threat inflation** would thereafter be a regular feature of the U.S. political and economic landscape. It mattered little what the Soviet enemy was actually doing, or in a position to do. All that was required was for an announcement that intelligence had revealed an ominous gap between U.S. and Soviet capabilities, and the money flowed. The missile gap on which John F. Kennedy rode to victory in 1960 yielded an immediate fifteen percent hike in defense spending. Years after the money had been appropriated and spent, **it was openly admitted by the relevant defense secretary, Robert McNamara, that in fact the gap had been entirely in favor of the U.S.** Similar, if less infamous episodes recurred featuring bombers, tanks, ships, anti-ballistic missiles and, most comprehensively, defense budgets themselves.

Embarrassing realities, such as serious shortcomings in our putative enemies capabilities, have generally been kept out of sight of the taxpayers. Equally, explosive cost overruns and technical disasters generate, at most, short term scandals. Pleas to cut the defense budget have rarely yielded much of a political dividend. Indeed, in former days, the very size of the budget, irrespective of its components, was touted as a necessary part of our deterrent. One of the more successful gaps of the cold war years was the greater size of the Soviet defense budget. **The Soviets didnt announce how much they were spending on defense** (even if they knew the real cost themselves, which is dubious); so the figure publicized by the military industrial complex was based on an ersatz calculation of the presumed cost to the Soviets of duplicating U.S. programs and systems. I.E., the cost of a Soviet swing-wing bomber would be assessed on the basis of the cost of a similar U.S. effort. Therefore, as Ernie Fitzgerald, the consummate Pentagon whistleblower of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, once observed, every time the B-1 bomber has a cost overrun, the Soviet defense budget goes up! In other words, the more dollars we wasted, the more dangerous the other side became, which justified our wasting even more dollars, and so on.

 George Tenet (former director of CIA): he missed 9/11--and here he looks at the camera and states We do not torture. We do not torture. We do not torture. We do not torture.  

Obviously, there are many other examples--James Clapper, Bill Clinton (etc)...but this interview on *60 minutes* takes the cake as far as Im concerned.  Tenet twists and turns in his chair and repeatedly tells whopper after whopper--all while attempting to get publicity for his book!!!

(I would have linked the full cbs interview if I wasnt so *opposed* to cbs--but I would encourage you to watch it)

 from Page 84 of *The Commission: The Uncensored History of the 9/11 Investigation* by Philip Shenon (2008):

The offices were in a seemingly undistinguished nine-floor federal building between the White House and Georgetown. **The building was secretly owned and operated by the CIA**, used as downtown office space by the agency. It was ideal for the commission because it qualified as a so-called SCIF, the acronym for secure compartmentalized information facility, which meant that it had security measures that allowed for the storage of highly classified documents. Apart from witnesses called to private interviews from the commission, only people with security clearances would be allowed to enter the commission's offices; all cell phones and other electronic devices had to be left at the door. Each of the staff members at K Street was provided with two computer hard drives--one for classified information, one for unclassified information.

-------------------

The CIA has already gone to great lengths to cover up the torture  and the unreliability of the testimony published by the 9/11 Commission.

The CIA has blocked release of the Senates torture report for years. In addition, it has taken many other actions to try to keep the lid on the torture program.

For example, the CIA videotaped the interrogation of 9/11 suspects, but falsely told the 9/11 Commission that there were no videotapes or other records of the interrogations, and then illegally destroyed all of the tapes and transcripts of the interrogations.

9/11 Commission co-chairs Thomas Keane and Lee Hamilton wrote:

*Those who knew about those videotapes  and did not tell us about them  obstructed our investigation*.

Government officials decided not to inform a lawfully constituted body, created by Congress and the president, to investigate one the greatest tragedies to confront this country. We call that obstruction.

(And **the chairs of both the 9/11 Commission and the Official Congressional Inquiry into 9/11 said that Soviet-style government minders obstructed the investigation into 9/11 by intimidating witnesses**. We believe that some of the minders were from the CIA.)

--------------

The committees preference was for the CIA to turn over all responsive documents to the committees office, as had been done in previous committee investigations.

Director Panetta proposed an alternative arrangement: to provide literally millions of pages of operational cables, internal emails, memos, and other documents pursuant to the committees document requests at a secure location in Northern Virginia. We agreed, but insisted on several conditions and protections to ensure the integrity of this congressional investigation.

Per an exchange of letters in 2009, then-Vice Chairman Bond, then-Director Panetta, and I agreed in an exchange of letters that the CIA was to provide a stand-alone computer system with a network drive segregated from CIA networks for the committee that would only be accessed by information technology personnel at the CIAwho would not be permitted to share information from the system with other [CIA] personnel, except as otherwise authorized by the committee.

It was this computer network that, notwithstanding our agreement with Director Panetta, was searched by the CIA this past January, and once before which I will later describe.

In addition to **demanding that the documents produced for the committee be reviewed at a CIA facility**, the CIA also insisted on conducting a multi-layered review of every responsive document before providing the document to the committee. This was to ensure the CIA did not mistakenly provide documents unrelated to the CIAs Detention and Interrogation Program or provide documents that the president could potentially claim to be covered by executive privilege.

http://cryptome.org/2014/03/feinstein-14-0311.pdf 














 

...the CIAs torture program ended up deceiving the 9/11 Commission. Specifically, the 9/11 Commission Report was largely based on third-hand accounts of what tortured detainees said, with two of the three parties in the communication being government employees. The 9/11 Commissioners were not allowed to speak with the detainees, or even their interrogators. Instead, they got their information third-hand. The Commission itself didnt really trust the interrogation testimonyyet published it as if it were Gospel.

New York Times investigative reporter Philip Shenon noted in a 2009 essay in Newsweek that the 9/11 Commission Report was unreliable because most of the information was based on the statements of tortured detainees.

As NBC News reported:

* Much of the 9/11 Commission Report was based upon the testimony of people who were tortured.

* At least four of the people whose interrogation figured in the 9/11 Commission Report have claimed that they told interrogators information as a way to stop being tortured.

* One of the Commissions main sources of information was tortured until he agreed to sign a confession that he was NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO READ.

* The 9/11 Commission itself doubted the accuracy of the torture confessions, and yet kept their doubts to themselves.

The CIA has already gone to great lengths to cover up the torture  and the unreliability of the testimony published by the 9/11 Commission.

John Brennan, the director of the CIA, said the claims by members of the Senate intelligence committee were spurious and wholly unsupported by the facts, and went as far as suggesting the committee itself may have been guilty of wrongdoing.

The battle stems from a hotly contested report into the use of torture by the CIA in the interrogations it carried out after 9/11, whose conclusions are so explosive that it has yet to be declassified, despite exhortations from the White House that a summary should be published. 

Earlier on Wednesday reports surfaced that the CIA inspector general had opened an inquiry, said to have been referred to the justice department, into claims that CIA employees had acted improperly. Suggestions that the CIA had monitored the computer networks of committee staffers had shocked the senators that sit on the panel. Some observers believe that such actions might be criminal.

Senator Mark Udall, a member of the committee who has been vocal in his critism of the CIA, had earlier written to Barack Obama alleging that the president knew about the unprecedented action carried out by the agency.

So, in light of today's article regarding the CIA spying on U.S. Senators investigating the torture allegations--what do you think happened to the 9/11 Commission staff???

---------------

The CIA Inspector Generals Office has asked the Justice Department to investigate allegations of malfeasance at the spy agency in connection with a yet-to-be released Senate Intelligence Committee report into the CIAs secret detention and interrogation program, McClatchy has learned.

The criminal referral may be related to what several knowledgeable people said was CIA monitoring of computers used by Senate aides to prepare the study. The monitoring may have violated an agreement between the committee and the agency.

 Phase 1 means canceling your cable--because cnn, fox, cbs, abc, nbc all still get paid (even if you don't watch them). All MSM webpages and newspapers would be boycotted as well--they have FAILED us and do not deserve our money or support. If there was a widespread boycott the MSM would start paying attention to us!!! This seems even more important now that we are no longer FREE to assemble without fearing our own government SPYING on us.

Phase 2 demands an independent investigation of 9/11 and all of the crimes which surround it including the financial and war crimes of the Bush/Cheney administration. The hearings must be open and under oath--no hiding behind closed doors. We, the People deserve to know our true history--in fact, we have PAID for it with our tax dollars and our soldiers lives. 

Phase 3 will lead where the evidence points.

The aircraft corporations who had garnered enormous profits during the war on the back of government contracts had discovered by 1947 that **peace was ruinous**. Despite initial high hopes, the commercial marketplace was proving a far harsher and less accommodating environment than that of wartime, especially as there were far more companies than required by the peacetime economy. Orders from the civilian airline industry never lived up to expectations while efforts to diversify into other products, including dishwashers and stainless steel coffins, proved disappointing and costly.

Something had to be done. In the spring of 1948 senior officials in the Truman Administration, including Secretary of Defense James Forrestal, suddenly began warning that the Soviets were on the brink of unleashing a surprise military attack against Western Europe. There was **no evidence** that the Soviets had any such intentions, a point, as declassified documents now make clear, that was well known to the senior officials. In fact Stalin, the Soviet leader, was enjoining the powerful western European communist parties from any revolutionary action and refusing to aid the Greek communists in their civil war against the U.S.-backed government.

This cause (need for stimulus in the aerospace industry) and effect (war scare leading to sharp increase in defense appropriations) was pithily summed up at the time by Lawrence D. Bell, President of the Bell Aircraft Corporation: As soon as there is a war scare, there is a lot of money available. And so it proved. The aircraft procurement budget soared **57**% as the overall Pentagon procurement budget exploded by almost **600** percent from less than $6 billion in 1947 to more than $35 billion in 1948 (in contemporary 2011 dollars). The industry, not to mention powerful institutions linked to its fortunes, such as **major banks**, was saved from collapse.

Apart from a brief relapse pending the outbreak of the Korean war in 1950, war scares, otherwise known as **threat inflation** would thereafter be a regular feature of the U.S. political and economic landscape. It mattered little what the Soviet enemy was actually doing, or in a position to do. All that was required was for an announcement that intelligence had revealed an ominous gap between U.S. and Soviet capabilities, and the money flowed. The missile gap on which John F. Kennedy rode to victory in 1960 yielded an immediate fifteen percent hike in defense spending. Years after the money had been appropriated and spent, it was openly admitted by the relevant defense secretary, Robert McNamara, that in fact the gap had been entirely in favor of the U.S. Similar, if less infamous episodes recurred featuring bombers, tanks, ships, anti-ballistic missiles and, most comprehensively, defense budgets themselves.

Embarrassing realities, such as serious shortcomings in our putative enemies capabilities, have generally been kept out of sight of the taxpayers. Equally, explosive cost overruns and technical disasters generate, at most, short term scandals. Pleas to cut the defense budget have rarely yielded much of a political dividend. Indeed, in former days, the very size of the budget, irrespective of its components, was touted as a necessary part of our deterrent. One of the more successful gaps of the cold war years was the greater size of the Soviet defense budget. The Soviets didnt announce how much they were spending on defense (even if they knew the real cost themselves, which is dubious); so the figure publicized by the military industrial complex was based on an ersatz calculation of the presumed cost to the Soviets of duplicating U.S. programs and systems. I.E., the cost of a Soviet swing-wing bomber would be assessed on the basis of the cost of a similar U.S. effort. Therefore, as Ernie Fitzgerald, the consummate Pentagon whistleblower of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, once observed, every time the B-1 bomber has a cost overrun, the Soviet defense budget goes up! In other words, the more dollars we wasted, the more dangerous the other side became, which justified our wasting even more dollars, and so on.

 It's been 50 years since JFK/MLK/RFK were fucking whacked--the USG is still holding 1,000's of records...

It's been 70+ years since WWII--the USG is still holding 1,000's of files on Operation Paperclip, dropping nukes on Japan, and even the Pearl Harbor event which began the U.S. entry into the war...

It's been almost 100 fucking years since the 1920 Wall Street bombing--yet the USG has still NOT released the FBI records that Hoover racked up...

**SO DO YOU REALLY THINK THE USG WILL RELEASE 9/11 RECORDS**??? 


































 1. President Truman created the CIA in 1947--but he also approved a secret codicil in the Marshall Plan of 1948 which allowed the CIA to ransack at least 5% of the $16.5 Billion the plan was given to rebuild 16 cities in Europe and 3 in Asia. The amount the CIA received was at least $680 million--big money back in those days, but it also helped spread their political slush money around the world. Truman was quite naive when it came to the CIA--his early director appointees exited the agency quickly. Truman exhibited his reservations about the CIA 15 years later: exactly one month after JFK was whacked he wrote an editorial in the Washington Post seriously questioning the activities of the CIA:
"For some time I have been disturbed by the way CIA has been diverted from its original assignment. It has become an operational and at times a policy-making arm of the Government. This has led to trouble and may have compounded our difficulties in several explosive areas." 
http://www.maebrussell.com/Prouty/Harry%20Truman's%20CIA%20article.html

2. Eisenhower warns of the Military Industrial Complex in his final statement as President. He also spoke the words "I want to resign" after being caught in a CIA lie about U2 flights over USSR. Eisenhower was a WWII war hero with NO political experience. He appointed Allen Dulles as director of central intelligence and his brother J.F. Dulles as secretary of state. The U.S., in short order, overthrew Iran in 1953 and Guatemala in 1954. Eisenhower also OK'd the assassinations of Patrice Lumumba and Fidel Castro on the same day. http://lippard.blogspot.com/2007/08/brief-history-of-cia-1953-1961.html So--to recap--that's 2 presidents, and BOTH of them definitely fucking felt betrayed by the MIC...we all know what happened to the 3rd, JFK...

3. JFK was whacked--most likely with the CIA leading the pack: 
The Secret Service stood down.
Dallas and Texas law enforcement stood down.
Military intelligence, which is normally enrolled to provide presidential security, stood down.
The FBI stood down.
These elements opened the door to the assassination, but did not have the resources to deliver the shooters and the complicated cover story and witness elimination program that followed.
Corrupt elements of the CIA and their long term friends and colleagues in organized crime did.
And they did it because their very survival was at stake. http://www.veteranstoday.com/2013/11/21/jfk-assassination-the-death-of-hope/

4. So out of the first 3 presidents in the post-WWII era: Truman regretted creating the CIA, Eisenhower was glad to retire because of the CIA/MIC bullshit; and JFK was fucking DEAD. Next up: LBJ. Somehow he found the time to sell his Halliburton stock on 11-22-63--but don't worry he still made $6 million in General Dynamics stock (about $60 million in today's dollars) after he amped up the war in Vietnam. In Octorber 1964, Martin Luther King, Jr earned a Nobel Peace Prize for his non-violent campaign against racism--MLK was the youngest man to receive the prize. Unfortunately, MLK also received a blackmail letter sent by the FBI--the letter also called for MLK to commit suicide and the content of the letter is still partially redacted to this day. In April of 1967 MLK began to vociferously oppose the war in Vietnam. Operation Minaret was run by the NSA and placed MLK, Whitney Young, U.S. Senators, anti-war protestors, Muhammad Ali--and even journalists under surveillance. The NSA had been created in 1952--by the mid-60's they were already shredding the U.S. Constitution. In April, 1968 MLK was assassinated--there is now a great deal of evidence which points towards the FBI and the U.S. military being the assassins. Before America could catch it's breath--just 4 months later-- Robert Kennedy was assassinated, too. RFK had been leading in the democratic party race for the presidential election. RFK posed a double threat because he was speaking out against Vietnam--but he might also run an actual investigation into his brother's killing if RFK had been elected. America was caught in a useless war, it's leaders were being shot down, the public was protesting at the White House and the Pentagon. LBJ, in one of his last interviews at the White House, admitted to Walter Cronkite that he thought there might have been a conspiracy to kill JFK. Like the Warren Commission, the truth was kept from the public and the footage wouldn't air until after LBJ's own death. 

4. Nixon gets caught up in Watergate--an obvious CIA set-up. Why would Nixon send known CIA operatives to break-in to DNC headquarters and allow them to do so in such sloppy fashion? How does ONE security guard catch FIVE burglars? Why would "professional" burglars carry so many direct links to the CIA and the White House? http://www.salon.com/2012/05/05/watergates_final_mystery/

5. Carter is undercut by Reagan's plot to free the Iranian hostages (Reagan's VP was GHW Bush--a former CIA director). Reagan breaks his own rule: "We do not negotiate with terrorists"...before he even enters the White House:
But its how Gates began his meteoric rise in the U.S. intelligence community during the Reagan years that has remained most cloaked in mystery. As a young CIA official in 1980, Gates was implicated in secret maneuvers to sabotage President Jimmy Carters negotiations to free 52 U.S. hostages then held in Iran, a failure by Carter that doomed his reelection. Gates was identified as one of the participants in a key October 1980 meeting in Paris allegedly also involving William Casey, who was then Reagans campaign director; George H.W. Bush, a former CIA director and then-Reagans vice presidential running mate; Iranian emissary Mehdi Karrubi; and Israeli intelligence officers, including Ari Ben-Menashe who later testified under oath about what he witnessed.http://consortiumnews.com/2013/06/08/second-thoughts-on-october-surprise/

6. Reagan/Bush manage to cover up Iran-Contra. CIA/military fingerprints all over this one. If the truth had come out--GHWB would most likely NOT have been elected President (and the republicans would have been seriously wounded in next election). http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB2/nsaebb2.htm

7. GHW Bush is President--U.S. goes to war with Iraq. In re-election campaign Ross Perot mysteriously decides to withdraw from the election (was he threatened?). He then re-enters which splits the vote--and Clinton is elected.

8. Clinton--was the whole Monica Lewinsky scandal a CIA-NSA-neocon operation to assure republican victory in the next election? $40 million spent to investigate. As the impeachment vote is taking place in the House of Representatives--the Speaker (a republican) resigns due to his own sexual dalliances--was this all designed to insure a republican victory in the upcoming elections?

9. GW Bush/Cheney elected--U.S. goes to war with Afghanistan and Iraq. $13 million spent to investigate 9/11 while TRILLIONS are spent on the MIC...

10. Rumors swirl that Obama told his donors "I don't want to end up like Martin Luther King." Press fails to even ask him if the rumor is true. Is the President of the United States of America being controlled by the CIA-NSA-DoD??? http://mondoweiss.net/2013/06/reneged-progressive-promises.html

 Full Letter: http://consortiumnews.com/2014/01/07/nsa-insiders-reveal-what-went-wrong/

------------------

"The sadder reality, Mr. President, is that NSA itself had enough information to prevent 9/11, but chose to sit on it rather than share it with the FBI or CIA. We know; we were there. We were witness to the many bureaucratic indignities that made NSA at least as culpable for pre-9/11 failures as are other U.S. intelligence agencies...

...My first day on the job at NSA was 9/11. I was immediately charged as the lead NSA executive to find and deploy the best technology at NSA for the fight against terrorism....

...Thats where I found the pre- and post-9/11 intelligence from NSA monitoring of some of the hijackers as they planned the attacks of 9/11 had not been shared outside NSA. This includes critical pre-9/11 intelligence on al-Qaeda, even though it had been worked on by NSA analysts. I learned, for example, that in early 2001 NSA had produced a critical long-term analytic report unraveling the entire heart of al-Qaeda and associated movements. That report also was not disseminated outside of NSA.

Make no mistake. That data and the analytic report could have, should have prevented 9/11...

...In short, when confronted with the prospect of fessing up, NSA chose instead to obstruct the 9/11 congressional investigation, play dumb, and keep the truth buried, including the fact that it knew about all inbound and outbound calls to the safe house switchboard in Yemen. NSAs senior leaders took me off the task because they realized  belatedly, for some reason  that I would not take part in covering up the truth about how much NSA knew but did not share.

When the 9/11 Commission hearings began, Director Hayden chortled at executive staff meetings over the fact that the FBI and CIA were feeling the heat for not having prevented 9/11. This was particularly difficult for me to sit through, for I was aware that NSA had been able to cover up its own culpability by keeping investigators, committees, and commissions away from the truth." 









 1. **Edward Snowden**: "My name is Ed Snowden, I'm 29 years old. I worked for Booz Allen Hamilton as an infrastructure analyst for NSA in Hawaii...I've been a systems engineer, systems administrator, senior adviser for the Central Intelligence Agency, solutions consultant, and a telecommunications informations system officer." (from first interview with Glenn Greenwald http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/jun/09/nsa-whistleblower-edward-snowden-interview-video)

2. **U.S. Marine--Blaine Cooper:**  "Hi, Mr. McCain. I mean this with all due respect (to you) as an elected official of our country. We, the people want you to be representative of the people--and for this great nation. But for far too long now the rest of Congress, including the executive branch along with the judicial and legislative--have turned your back on the American people and their core values and principles. i can say, with great confidence, and speak on behalf of all Americans that your actions against this country are treasonous. All of you--against the will of the American people--have aided and abetted the enemy. You and the rest of Congress, including the President of the United States, have went against the will of your people in Syria. Regardless of your position and vote (whether it is a "yes" or "no") is still a political smokescreen. I Believe wholeheartedly you do not care about the will and well-being of America or it's people. You lie to the American people about chemical attacks in Syria. The American people know that it was our government that is most responsible. There is strong evidence, including video, that these attacks were carried out by Al Qaeda and you advocate starting war, maybe even world war, by taking the same attack and blaming it on Assad. President Barack Hussein Obama has been supporting terrorism. The United States has been funding and aiding organizations including the Muslim Brotherhood and Al Qaeda for many years now--the same enemy we're supposed to be defeating on the battlefield. At least one country in this world stood up against this government terrorism that you guys support in Egypt...(cont.)

3. **Russ Tice**: "They went after high ranking military officers. They went after members of congress. The Senate and the House - especially on the intelligence committees, and on the armed services committees and judicial. But they went after other ones too. They went after lawyers and law firms. Heaps of lawyers and law firms. They went after judges. One of the judges is now sitting on the supreme court that I had his wiretap information in my hand. Two are former FISA court judges. They went after state department officials. They went after people in the executive service that were part of the White House - their own people! They went after anti-war groups. They went after US companies that do international business around the world. They went after US banking firms and financial firms that do international business. They went after NGOs like the red cross and people like that that go overseas and do humanitarian work. They went after a few anti-war civil rights groups...Now here's the big one...June 20th interview on Boiling Frogs...http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPyxeqcCjkc (full 1hr+ radio interview)

4. **Cornell West:** "We elected a black president and that means we are less racist now than we used to be. That's beautiful. But when you look at the prison industrial complex and the new Jim Crow: levels of massive unemployment and the decrepit unemployment system, indecent housing: white supremacy is still operating in the US, even with a brilliant black face in a high place called the White House. He is a brilliant, charismatic black brother. He's just too tied to Wall Street. And at this point he is a war criminal. You can't meet every Tuesday with a killer list and continually have drones drop bombs. You can do that once or twice and say: 'I shouldn't have done that, I've got to stop.' But when you do it month in, month out, year in, year out  that's a pattern of behaviour. I think there is a chance of a snowball in hell that he will ever be tried, but I think he should be tried and I said the same about George Bush. These are war crimes. We suffer in this age from an indifference toward criminality and a callousness to catastrophe when it comes to poor and working people."http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/may/13/cornel-west-they-say-i-am-unamerican

5. **Richard Belzer**: "...not wanting to go through with the Bay of Pigs and wanting to get out of Vietnam--that's why he was murdered. Because there's so much money that was made in Vietnam--tons of money--and that prolonged the war without reason. Eisenhower warned us about the military industrial complex and Kennedy understood it. He came in office and inherited the Bay of Pigs from Eisenhower and the CIA and some of the people in the military lied to Kennedy about what would happen in Cuba. So the reach of the CIA has gone beyond it's charter. He fired Allan Dulles, the head of the CIA. He said I'm going to shatter the CIA into thousands of pieces because they went beyond their charter. **They're supposed to be covert**--they're not supposed to be starting wars. Even Harry Truman was appalled at what was going on because some elements of his government were getting nazi war criminals into our country illegally--subverting the will of the Nuremberg trials--because we wanted the neo-nazi scientists. There's a lot of dark stuff--but it's in the public domain. There's thousands of pages that can't be released until 2075. But there's an interesting thing in 2014--England's statute of limitations on certain things can come out. And what we're going to find out from that is Allan Dulles--who was the CIA head fired by Kennedy--was later on the Warren Commission...Allan Dulles should have been hung for treason for what he did during World War Two. He worked for the nazis throughout the war--hid money for American and English bankers. He was one of the most contemptable people ever--Allan Dulles." (last 3 minutes of 15 minute May, 2013 interview: http://www.politico.com/multimedia/video/2013/05/richard-belzer-book-tackles-jfk-conspiracies.html)

6. **Thomas Drake**: "From the recent disclosures of Edward Snowden, the US government has routinely violated on a vast industrial scale the Constitutional protections afforded its own citizens, while also disregarding the internal integrity of other states and the fundamental rights of non-US citizens. I know. Because I was eyewitness to the very foundations of a persistent surveillance state greatly expanded in the deepest of secrecy right after 9/11. I was there at the beginning." (Must See 16 minute speech before EU Parliament Sept. 30, 3013...speech/full transcript at:http://www.whistleblower.org/blog/44-2013/2981-nsa-whistleblower-thomas-drake-statement-before-eu-parliament-committee)

7. **Paul Sperry:** "The Saudis deny any role in 9/11, but the CIA in one memo reportedly found incontrovertible evidence that Saudi government officials  not just wealthy Saudi hardliners, but high-level diplomats and intelligence officers employed by the kingdom  helped the hijackers both financially and logistically. The intelligence files cited in the report directly implicate the Saudi embassy in Washington and consulate in Los Angeles in the attacks, making 9/11 not just an act of terrorism, but an act of war."
http://nypost.com/2013/12/15/inside-the-saudi-911-coverup/

8. **Tegan Mathis**: "America's national security leaders, who had run foreign policy since WWII, decided to get rid of President Kennedy. In early 1963, President Kennedy -- in an effort to cut the CIA leadership and the Joint Chiefs out of the loop -- handed all responsibility for covert operations in Cuba to Army Secretary Cyrus Vance (a civilian). Army Colonel Alexander Haig became Secretary Vance's liaison to the Cuban Brigade...The official version of Haig's service under Vance says he provided social services for the Cuban Brigade members. (He provided them with employment and educational opportunities.) But this is just a cover story. In reality, Haig was an intelligence officer. His duty was to train the Cuban Brigade members to oust Fidel Castro. Yes, that's right, Al Haig wasn't really a social worker. Surprise, surprise! ...But here's the thing: In addition to training the Brigade members to oust Fidel Castro, Haig trained a select few of them to oust President Kennedy. Here's the other thing: Every stage of the operation was supervised and funded by Attorney General Bobby Kennedy, right down to the creating of a legacy for the patsy, Lee Oswald. Oswald was evidently supposed to travel to Cuba to play a peripheral role in the anti-Castro coup plan. Bobby Kennedy unwittingly had a hand in almost every aspect his own brother's assassination. Because the 1963 plot to oust Castro was an ultra-secret operation, so is the plot they used to murder President Kennedy. The two plots are one in the same. In other words, the truth about the John F. Kennedy assassination is still, to this very day, buried beneath the plot to oust Fidel Castro. (For those of you familiar with this subject matter, Lamar Waldron and Thom Hartmann refer to the secret plot to oust Castro as the "Almeida coup plan," but they don't understand that the plot was actually used to kill Kennedy.)...Howard Hunt had recruited the Cuban Brigade members for the CIA dating back to 1959. When Vance put Haig in charge of the Cuban Brigade in 1963, he also put him in charge of Hunt. But Hunt, like Haig, had turned against the President. When Hunt was linked to the Watergate break-in in 1972, all hell broke loose. By then, Haig had become a top aide to President Nixon. And all or most of the Watergate burglars had worked with or for Haig and Hunt in 1963, some of them on the plot to murder President Kennedy. This is what Watergate was really about. With the help of fake journalists like Bob Woodward, Haig led all of the attention away from Hunt and the CIA and towards Richard Nixon's Reelection Committee (or CREEP). In the end, Haig forced Nixon out, and Ford issued an all-encompassing pardon that took all of the attention off Haig and his fellow assassins. That's really all there is to it. (Tegan Mathis wrote: *Against Them: How   Why Alexander Haig, Bob Woodward, Donald Rumsfeld,   Richard Cheney Covered Up the JFK Assassination in the Wake of the Watergate Break-In*...from comments posted in May 9, 2013 article by Russ Baker... http://whowhatwhy.com/2013/05/09/jfk-rfk-mlk-the-questions-remain/)

9. **Preston James, Ph D**: The sealed executive sessions of the HSCA should be released. These were the highly classified executive sessions with folks like Marita Lorenz and Frank Sturgis of OP40 who testified and provided numerous photos and docs. They were given immunity in exchange for cooperating. The records provided included a photo of the Op40 crew at the Motel the night before with Jack Ruby and much more. Ask Gaeton Fonzi, he knows but Ill bet he wont admit it...When Frank Sturgis was arrested in NYC right before the HSCA Hearings, he made one phone call, supposed to Gaeton Fonzi, who then contacted infamous mob attorney Frank Nelson who came and bailed Sturgis out of jail the next morning. The executive sessions boxed and sealed evidence is filled with so much smoking gun evidence that it would have brought down the whole US intel system and much of the USG, which basically was transformed into a huge criminal syndicate by those who murdered JFK. What is in the sealed files?  That the JFK Assassination was a deep black USD covert operation run right out of the JCS with LBJ, Bush1, Nixon, J. Edgar Mary, Lemnitzer, Lansdale, E Howard Hunt, Phillips, and CIA/Op40 doing the shooting with numerous others ops and mafia brought in to provide false leads. If the boxes were opened now and released 100% as is, they would still probably bring down much of the USG and American Intel, since many of the same power control groups who did it are still in power and are completely illegitimate. One of the boxes contains a signed finding by LBJ that JFK was a clear threat to US national security. And there are numerous videos taken from Dealey Plaza which show what really happened. These videos are the real deal, not morphed and edited like the faked Zapruder film.

---------------------

These quotes shocked me and made me question what the TRUTH really is. 2013 was filled with Snowden revelations--but there were quotes from other veteran NSA whistleblowers as well which corroborated what Snowden was saying. It was also 50 years since JFK being assassinated--these quotes about JFK made me think about the possibilities...

edit: might be best just to type your favorite quote and let them be upvoted...be a good idea to double-check and see if they were actually written/spoken in 2013 (all of these definitely were--the date can be found in the link)...

 "Regarding possible conspiracies, to this day I have serious doubts that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. I certainly have doubts that he was motivated to do that by himself. Im not sure if anybody else was involved. I dont go down that road, with respect to the grassy knoll theory and all of that, but I have serious questions about whether they got to the bottom of Lee Harvey Oswald. I think he was inspired somewhere by something, but I cant pin anything down on that. Ive never spent a lot of time on it. But I think, after a certain period of time, and that period of time may well have passed, **it is totally appropriate for a country like the United States to open up the files** on whatever history can be shed light on. I think that is appropriate. It has to be done in the right way, by the right entities or people, but certainly by a valid historian or for some valid analysis; I think that everybody would benefit."

 "Intelligence is a sacred cow...The CIA isn't worth a damn." --Nixon

Nixon fired Richard Helms on Nov. 20, 1972 but allowed Helms to stay on until March 1973. On Nov. 21, Nixon appointed his own man to the CIA--James Schlesinger, and told him to "Get rid of the clowns. What use are they? They've got 40,000 people over there reading newspapers."

Schlesinger then sent out a memo at the Agency part of which read:

I have ordered all senior operating officials of this Agency to report to me immediately on any activities now going on, or that have gone on in the past, which might be construed to be outside the legislative charter of this Agency.

I hereby direct every person presently employed by CIA to report to me on any such activities of which he has knowledge. I invite all ex-employees to do the same. Anyone who has such knowledge should call...and say that he wishes to tell me about "activities outside CIA's charter." 









 "Were the Soviet Union to sink tomorrow under the waters of the ocean, the American militaryindustrial complex would have to remain, substantially unchanged, until some other adversary *could be invented*. Anything else would be an unacceptable shock to the American economy." (emphasis mine)

--George F. Kennan in preface of Norman Cousins's 1987 book The Pathology of Power

The implications of this quote definitely startled me a bit when I first came across these words about a year ago. After looking up his wikipedia and learning Kennan was a career diplomat and historian--he seemed to be an influential insider who helped mold the Truman Doctrine and thrusted the U.S. into the Cold War. But Kennan was more than a player in creating U.S. foreign policy after WWII--he was actually at vital meetings that helped create a brutal, under-handed agency mindframe that was often out of control.

It wasn't until I read **Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA** (2007) that Kennan lost the gentlemanly diplomatic facade and was exposed as something quite sinister. The book contains a quote from a 1948 secret report which was sent to the U.S. State Dept, the White House and the Pentagon in which Kennan called for "the inauguration of organized political warfare". Another memo sent to Sec. of Defense Forrestal called for the formation of "a guerrilla warfare corps". Obviously, these are much different purposes than what the original function of the CIA was stated to be--an intelligence agency updating the President on world events.

Even if you know some of the sordid details of the CIA--Tim Weiner's book *Legacy of Ashes* will make it quite clear that Kennan's memos were taken seriously--and if only HALF of what Tim Weiner writes is true then America has been subjected to the biggest CON JOB ever. The book weighs in at 809 pages with almost 200 pages of notes/sources and much of the info is from the CIA's own files. It begins with the end of WWII and proceeds chronologically without getting bogged down in code names. Direct quotes are used often, sometimes they even jump off the page: "We killed thousands of Communists, even though half of them probably didn't know what Communism meant. (CIA pilot Al Pope)".

After reading the first 60 pages it's stunning how the CIA was able to disregard all laws and procedures in the U.S. to get initial funding. For the first year or two Wall Street bankers were asked to chip in by sending a million or so overseas--then they could mark a special code on their tax form and write it off. Other familiar names quickly enter the picture--Allan Dulles, John Foster Dulles, Richard Helms, Richard Bissell. The drive for power was matched by the increase in funding--by 1948 the CIA had somehow ransacked 5% of the Marshall Plan money which came out to $680 million over 4 years through a secret clause.

So, right from the start, the CIA finances were crooked, Americans--often even the President and congress-- unaware. The stated mission of intelligence gathering was taking a backseat for much higher stakes of assassination, funding/training militia groups--laws simply did not apply in any way to the CIA. The Agency was gambling and it's actions were often sloppy and self-defeating. The enemy was anyone who didn't openly reject communism and bend over for American business. From Japan to Iran to Guatemala to the Congo--the Agency poured in cash to political parties and journalists. If that didn't work the proper militias or henchmen were supplied with weapons and hired.

As I pondered the first three chapters of Legacy of Ashes two questions raced through my mind: can the U.S. possibly be much deeper in debt than the $17 Trillion they are telling us? Secondly, could 9/11 have been perpetrated by the CIA to destroy (permanently) financial records and to further fund the defense/intelligence sectors?

The reason I ask these questions is because of the enormous economic fraud from the inception of the CIA which was perpetrated by the Dulles brothers and the Wall Street bankers who backed the Agency. On top of that is the fact that the CIA is but one of a myriad of defense and intelligence arms of the U.S. and you have to question why Americans have not demanded an open audit immediately. Just in the intelligence/homeland security field there are now well over 3,000 government agencies and private contractors churning out over 50,000 reports a year. The Dept. of Defense has no actual audit in recent memory--though there are rumors an audit was made in 1993. No one has ever seen an actual audit for the CIA (let alone the entire defense/intelligence budget). Even today, the CIA's budget total is written on a piece of paper and then shown to a senior senator of the Intelligence Committee--no one else (outside of the CIA and possibly the President). Now multiply that process 20 or 30 times for all the other major U.S. Government agencies.

*Legacy of Ashes* proves the President has often been oblivious to the plans being played out by the CIA. Justice has been subverted--every law in the U.S. and internationally has been laughed at and spat upon while the party goes on in CIA mansions around the world. After just one dozen years of existence the CIA had played the politics of fear so successfully that Eisenhower was giving the OK to assassinate Lumumba (leader of Congo) and Fidel Castro in just one meeting. There's a reason they won't release most of the files for 50 or 60 years--because the citizens of the U.S. and the world would demand an actual investigation (one which doesn't involve puppets).

The dangerous threat these defense and intelligence agencies present to freedom and democracy--especially when added to the Edward Snowden revelations--should stop you in your tracks. I highly suggest you read the book and seriously consider the implications of these agencies being allowed such an extreme lack of accountability. In the end even Presidents Truman and Eisenhower had many regrets over their dealings with the Agency--Truman regretted creating it and Eisenhower even blurted out "I would like to resign" after he had been burned (and exposed) by a CIA operation which involved the U2 spy plane.

 do you honestly think that after 50 years the American press is going to tell you the TRUTH???

there may be journalists who tried--but in the end it is the editors   publishers decision what to print.

we know from Russ Tice that the editors just run to the government to get approval--so QUIT watching American media--it's PROPAGANDA.

there is a reason "The Men Who Killed Kennedy" was made in England.

there is a reason "The Dark Side of JFK" was published in Europe.

the TRUTH cuts too deep. the TRUTH shakes the walls at the the three letter agencies.

the TRUTH will NOT be revealed on cnn or cbs or abc...

 "The NSA must be shattered into a billion pieces and it's leaders who violated the law immediately brought to justice. It must be defunded and **the thievery must stop**. Over 3,000 government agencies and private contractors have **screwed the taxpayers** out of TRILLIONS since 9/11. On top of that, the American taxpayer has been funding Industrial Espionage for private corporations. As a **Final Insult**, millions of Americans have repeatedly been spied on and victimized without due process of law being followed." 




 For example: how did the government cover up the JFK plot?

EASY--they intimidated witnesses and monitored everyone's phone   mail. Certainly makes killing those who knew too much a lot easier. Makes "journalists"  much easier to control as well. Covering-up 200 deaths over the next 15 years becomes pretty easy too.

We are finally finding out the lengths the government will go to control us--by spying on Martin Luther King, active U.S. senators, public figures like John Lennon and Muhammad Ali. Even the Smothers Brothers QUIT rather than continue having their work chiseled down every week by the TV censors. I'll bet even Oliver Stone is thinking about WHY he had such a hard time making "Apocalypse Now". No wonder it was so easy for the "film reviewers" to berate and belittle "JFK" when it came out--they most likely had the script for months before seeing the movie.

Then there's the journalists--who have been spied on, harassed and sometimes even killed. From Dorothy Killeen to Michael Hastings--I even recently saw "Dirty Wars" by Jeremy Scahill where he is harassed during the filming of his documentary. Ever wonder why reporters don't "follow the money" into the Pentagon or CIA???

It is becoming clear that the "news" is pure propaganda that is approved ultimately by government agencies--there is NO FREEDOM OF THE PRESS--it is a mirage.  





























 excerpt from washington post/business...

Booz Allen, based in Tysons Corner, has been a local fixture for years, employing thousands and providing management and consulting services to the government, particularly the defense and intelligence agencies. It even sponsored a local golf tournament  the Booz Allen Classic  between 2004 and 2006. It also became a leader among the contractors supplying tens of thousands of intelligence analysts to the government in recent years, including technologists such as Snowden.

Those government contracts, and thousands more like them, in 2008 made Booz Allen a ripe acquisition target for Carlyle Group. It paid **$2.54 billion** for Booz Allen as a deep recession took hold. Fearing the risks of taking on too much debt in the midst of a financial crisis, Carlyle put up **50 percent cash** instead of its normal 30 percent. It borrowed the rest to buy the company, which was then privately held.

Upon the close of the deal, the less profitable international and commercial business was spun off to become Booz   Co., leaving Carlyle with a government-only company. After the split, the new Booz Allen Hamilton established an **incentive-based compensation** structure that gave the remaining partners a stake in the firms success. In effect, said one person close to the deal who was not authorized to speak publicly, **you got to eat what you killed**. http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-06-11/business/39896957_1_carlyle-group-nsa-firm

-----------------------------

excerpt from the guardian june 10, 2013...by julian borger...

**The current director of national intelligence (DNI), James Clapper**, who issued a stinging attack on the intelligence leaks this weekend, is a former Booz Allen executive. The firm's **current vice-chairman, Mike McConnell, was DNI under the George W Bush administration**. He worked for the Virginia-based company before taking the job, and returned to the firm after leaving it. The company website says McConnell is responsible for its "rapidly expanding cyber business".

**James Woolsey, a former CIA director** was also a Booz Allen vice-president, and Melissa Hathaway, another former company executive also once worked as the top aide on cybersecurity to McConnell when he was DNI. The company headquarters in the leafy Washington suburb of McLean in northern Virginia, close to CIA headquarters and home to former and current intelligence officers.

Snowden's decision to reveal his identity as a computer systems administrator for Booz Allen Hamilton, directly handling National Security Agency IT systems, raises significant image problems for the **$6bn company** and its 25,000-strong staff, which has traded on a bond of trust with sensitive clients, particularly the intelligence establishment. http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/09/booz-allen-hamilton-edward-snowden

 Top 3 JFK free documentaries on youtube...

1. Attorney Mark Lane's 1966 book/film "Rush to Judgement" documents the accounts of about 20 witnesses in Dealey Plaza on 11-22-63. The witnesses all had excellent views of the tragic events, yet, had their testimony ignored by the Warren Commission. By the time the documentary came out many Americans had been effectively, and continuously, sold the OSWALD MYTH by the repetitious drones of the FBI and Warren Comm. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAnX7atkpyA

2. "The Men Who Killed Kennedy" Parts 1-9 (1988-2003)...While Ken Burns was taking documentary films to new heights by covering the Civil War, Baseball and Jazz, the English produced "TMWKK" series which covers many avenues--some being shocking for their plausibility and others covering aspects which stretch science and imaginations a bit too much. Very telling that this was made in England--and that the last 3 parts were BANNED from American TV. Also notable is the number of witnesses who only speak out as they retire from their jobs--including 16 doctors from Parkland Hospital who all make corroborating statements regarding JFK's wounds. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2agPurqFJk

3. "Evidence of Revision" Parts 1-6 plus extras (2006)."Documents which define history should belong to the public, not private interests"...My favorite Epic Documentary Masterpiece which delves into the assassinations of JFK, MLK and RFK. The film has a wealth of rare, live footage from the days the events occurred as well as info from recently released intelligence files. "E of R" boldly steps into arenas that will challenge your thoughts on the history of American defense/intelligence agencies as they became involved with Vietnam. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBxMJFQd04 ...(Part 6 of "Evidence of Revision" is 2hrs8mins--some versions cut off the end)...

 "Informed sources in Washington have been leaking stories about the reorganization of the Secret Service for months, forever insisting that all that's needed to prevent a repitition of Dallas is more money, more men, more informers...the Secret Service is feeding a special computer the names and data of all known individuals, groups and organizations who might try to kill the president....Jan 1, 1968 should be a red letter day on the calendar. As from that date, presidential assassinations in the U.S. will no longer be practicable--thanks to the all seeing eyes, all hearing ears and divining brain of the magic robot that will start functioning at Secret Service headquarters that day." (from Prologue, page 9)

**"Since these snipers were operating out of a closed area which was controlled by the police, and was a Sheriff's parking lot, they cannot possibly have been there, or have remained undetected, without police connivance."** (page 21)

"Ever since I first accused (Chief of Police) Curry and his Chief of Homicide J. Will Fritz, of having been directly implicated in the JFK murder, I have been waiting to hear from these gentlemen, or at least one of them, through his lawyer, but alas, in vain." (page 22)
"For even greater effect, my British publisher (took out) a two-page spread...which explicitly invited those named in the book to sue him, and me, for libel so the case could at last be aired in a court of law... There is nothing more frustrating in the world than to not be able to get a libel suit out of somebody you've called a murderer to his face. And a presidential murderer, to boot." (page 23)

----------------------------

Deputy Sheriff Roger Craig also writes about this...

**"Let us examine this parking lot. It was leased by Deputy Sheriff B. D. Gossett. He in turn rented parking space by the month to the deputies who worked in the court house, except for official vehicles. I rented one of these spaces from Gossett when I was a dispatcher working days or evenings. I paid Gossett $3.00 per month and was given a key to the lot. An interesting point is that the lot had an iron bar across the only entrance and exit (which were the same). The bar had a chain and lock on it. The only people having access to it were deputies with keys."**

http://www.ratical.org/ratville/JFK/WTKaP.html

Roger Craig's story is a bit painful to read--he was harassed and terrorized by the FBI or the CIA because he was willing to talk to reporters and tell them what he knew...Roger Craig even went a bit further and did some investigative work for Jim Garrison--and in light of the recent NSA/FBI revelations--maybe what he said in his writing will be seen in a new context...

 Harry Truman in Washington Post editorial Dec. 22, 1963...(the editorial only ran in the morning edition--it was pulled from other editions)

For some time I have been disturbed by the way CIA has been diverted from its original assignment. It has become an operational and at times a policy-making arm of the Government. This has led to trouble and may have compounded our difficulties in several explosive areas.

I never had any thought that when I set up the CIA that it would be injected into peacetime cloak and dagger operations. Some of the complications and embarrassment I think we have experienced are in part attributable to the fact that this quiet intelligence arm of the President has been so removed from its intended role that it is being interpreted as a symbol of sinister and mysterious foreign intrigueand a subject for cold war enemy propaganda.

With all the nonsense put out by Communist propaganda about "Yankee imperialism," "exploitive capitalism," "war-mongering," "monopolists," in their name-calling assault on the West, the last thing we needed was for the CIA to be seized upon as something akin to a subverting influence in the affairs of other people.

I well knew the first temporary director of the CIA, Adm. Souers, and the later permanent directors of the CIA, Gen. Hoyt Vandenberg and Allen Dulles. These were men of the highest character, patriotism and integrityand I assume this is true of all those who continue in charge.

But there are now some searching questions that need to be answered. I, therefore, would like to see the CIA be restored to its original assignment as the intelligence arm of the President, and that whatever else it can properly perform in that special fieldand that its operational duties be terminated or properly used elsewhere.
We have grown up as a nation, respected for our free institutions and for our ability to maintain a free and open society. There is something about the way the CIA has been functioning that is casting a shadow over our historic position and I feel that we need to correct it.

 







































 otherwise, how would the U.S. have over 1,000 foreign military bases?

otherwise, why would the U.S. only take military action against smaller countries with inferior armies and weapons?

i may be wrong about the number of foreign military bases--but whatever that number is--we still have a lot of them...even our base in guantanamo is based on stealing and bullying--i think we acquired it  at the end of the Spanish-American War in 1903--the lease may have been signed under duress and does not end (which is illegal) and the payment is $2,000 per year...supposedly, Cuba has cashed only one of these checks and has demanded the lease be torn up ever since.

edit: the contract with cuba was upped to $4,000 in 1934--since then only 1 check has been cashed. 




 1. Comments by **Tegan Mathis** (posted in comment section of an article titled "JFK-RFK-MLK??? The Questions Remain" by Russ Baker on whowhatwhy.com)...

If you want to know the truth about the JFK assassination, here it is:
After the Bay of Pigs, the Berlin Wall, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Limited Test Ban Treaty, the Peace Speech, the orders to withdraw troops from Vietnam, etc., America's national security leaders, who had run foreign policy since WWII, decided to get rid of President Kennedy.
In early 1963, President Kennedy -- in an effort to cut the CIA leadership and the Joint Chiefs out of the loop -- handed all responsibility for covert operations in Cuba to Army Secretary Cyrus Vance (a civilian). Army Colonel Alexander Haig became Secretary Vance's liaison to the Cuban Brigade. The Cuban Brigade was the army of Cuban exiles who carried out the Bay of Pigs operation in 1961.
The official version of Haig's service under Vance says he provided social services for the Cuban Brigade members. (He provided them with employment and educational opportunities.) But this is just a cover story. In reality, Haig was an intelligence officer. His duty was to train the Cuban Brigade members to oust Fidel Castro. Yes, that's right, Al Haig wasn't really a social worker. Surprise, surprise!

But here's the thing: In addition to training the Brigade members to oust Fidel Castro, Haig trained a select few of them to oust President Kennedy.
**Here's the other thing:** Every stage of the operation was supervised and funded by Attorney General Bobby Kennedy, right down to the creating of a legacy for the patsy, Lee Oswald. Oswald was evidently supposed to travel to Cuba to play a peripheral role in the anti-Castro coup plan. Bobby Kennedy unwittingly had a hand in almost every aspect his own brother's assassination.
Because the 1963 plot to oust Castro was an ultra-secret operation, so is the plot they used to murder President Kennedy. The two plots are one in the same. In other words, the truth about the John F. Kennedy assassination is still, to this very day, buried beneath the plot to oust Fidel Castro. (For those of you familiar with this subject matter, Lamar Waldron and Thom Hartmann refer to the secret plot to oust Castro as the "Almeida coup plan," but they don't understand that the plot was actually used to kill Kennedy.)
Howard Hunt had recruited the Cuban Brigade members for the CIA dating back to 1959. When Vance put Haig in charge of the Cuban Brigade in 1963, he also put him in charge of Hunt. But Hunt, like Haig, had turned against the President.

When Hunt was linked to the Watergate break-in in 1972, all hell broke loose. By then, Haig had become a top aide to President Nixon. And all or most of the Watergate burglars had worked with or for Haig and Hunt in 1963, some of them on the plot to murder President Kennedy. This is what Watergate was really about.
With the help of fake journalists like Bob Woodward, Haig led all of the attention away from Hunt and the CIA and towards Richard Nixon's Reelection Committee (or CREEP).
In the end, Haig forced Nixon out, and Ford issued an all-encompassing pardon that took all of the attention off Haig and his fellow assassins.
That's really all there is to it. But if you want to know more, read my book, Against Them: How   Why Alexander Haig, Bob Woodward, Donald Rumsfeld,   Richard Cheney Covered Up the JFK Assassination in the Wake of the Watergate Break-In. Or, if it's easier for you to believe that Alexander Haig was a social worker to the Cuban Brigade, that's cool too.

**2.** Comments by **Preston James, Ph D** (posted in comments of article titled "The JFK War: The Case of Federal Judge John Tunheim" by Dr. James Fetzer on VeteransToday.com)...

Excellent article. The sealed executive sessions of the HSCA should be released. These were the highly classified executive sessions with folks like Marita Lorenz and Frank Sturgis of OP40 who testified and provided numerous photos and docs. They were given immunity in exchange for cooperating. The records provided included a photo of the Op40 crew at the Motel the night before with Jack Ruby and much more. Ask Gaeton Fonzi, he knows but Ill bet he wont admit it.

When Frank Sturgis was arrested in NYC right before the HSCA Hearings, he made one phone call, supposed to Gaeton Fonzi, who then contacted infamous mob attorney Frank Nelson who came and bailed Sturgis out of jail the next morning. The **executive sessions boxed and sealed evidence** is filled with so much smoking gun evidence that it would have brought down the whole US intel system and much of the USG, which basically was transformed into a huge criminal syndicate by those who murdered JFK. What is in the sealed files?

That the JFK Assassination was a deep black USD covert operation run right out of the JCS with LBJ, Bush1, Nixon, J. Edgar Mary, Lemnitzer, Lansdale, E Howard Hunt, Phillips, and CIA/Op40 doing the shooting with numerous others ops and mafia brought in to provide false leads. If the boxes were opened now and released 100% as is, they would still probably bring down much of the USG and American Intel, since many of the same power control groups who did it are still in power and are completely illegitimate. One of the boxes contains a signed finding by LBJ that JFK was a clear threat to US national security. And there are numerous videos taken from Dealey Plaza which show what really happened. These videos are the real deal, not morphed and edited like the faked Zapruder film.

**3.** "...not wanting to go through with the Bay of Pigs and wanting to get out of Vietnam--that's why he was murdered. Because there's so much money that was made in Vietnam--tons of money--and that prolonged the war without reason. Eisenhower warned us about the military industrial complex and Kennedy understood it. He came in office and inherited the Bay of Pigs from Eisenhower and the CIA and some of the people in the military lied to Kennedy about what would happen in Cuba. So the reach of the CIA has gone beyond it's charter. He fired Allan Dulles, the head of the CIA. He said I'm going to shatter the CIA into thousands of pieces because they went beyond their charter. **They're supposed to be covert**--they're not supposed to be starting wars. Even Harry Truman was appalled at what was going on because some elements of his government were getting nazi war criminals into our country illegally--subverting the will of the Nuremberg trials--because we wanted the neo-nazi scientists. There's a lot of dark stuff--but it's in the public domain. There's thousands of pages that can't be released until 2075. But there's an interesting thing in 2014--England's statute of limitations on certain things can come out. And what we're going to find out from that is Allan Dulles--who was the CIA head fired by Kennedy--was later on the Warren Commission...Allan Dulles should have been hung for treason for what he did during World War Two. He worked for the nazis throughout the war--hid money for American and English bankers. He was one of the most contemptable people ever--Allan Dulles."

 "Were the Soviet Union to sink tomorrow under the waters of the ocean, the American military-industrial complex would have to remain, substantially unchanged, *until some other adversary could be invented*. Anything else would be an unacceptable shock to the American economy."

 1. Attorney Mark Lane's 1966 book/film "Rush to Judgement" documents the accounts of about 20 witnesses in Dealey Plaza on 11-22-63. The witnesses all had excellent views of the tragic events, yet, had their testimony ignored by the Warren Commission. By the time the documentary came out many Americans had been effectively, and continuously, sold the OSWALD MYTH by the repetitious drones of the FBI and Warren Comm.

2. "The Men Who Killed Kennedy" Parts 1-9 (1988-2003)...While Ken Burns was taking documentary films to new heights by covering the Civil War, Baseball and Jazz, the English produced "TMWKK" series which covers many avenues--some being shocking for their plausibility and others covering aspects which stretch science and imaginations a bit too much. Very telling that this was made in England--and that the last 3 parts were BANNED from American TV. Also notable is the number of witnesses who only speak out as they retire from their jobs--including 16 doctors from Parkland Hospital who all make corroborating statements regarding JFK's wounds.

3. "Evidence of Revision" Parts 1-6 plus extras (2006)."Documents which define history should belong to the public, not private interests"...My favorite Epic Documentary Masterpiece which delves into the assassinations of JFK, MLK and RFK. The film has a wealth of rare, live footage from the days the events occurred as well as info from recently released intelligence files. "E of R" boldly steps into arenas that will challenge your thoughts on the history of American defense/intelligence agencies as they became involved with Vietnam.

These 3 films expose the shocking events in many ways the American public was unable to see at the time. The public was not allowed to see the Zapruder film until the mid-1970's (there were only still images released until then). Even 50 years later, there is a great deal of files the government still will NOT release--as if 50 YEARS LATER it is still a national security issue. The films often present evidence the JFK assassination was a COUP D'ETAT and an action which allowed the military, intelligence, financial, and energy sectors to expand their will upon the American people--and the world. You might totally disagree with this conclusion--but to NOT view these films (and do other research) would be a short-sighted failure to question the *official* government version. Authorities have only released info in a painstakingly slow drip-by-drip manner--and has treated Americans like SERFS who do not deserve to know the truth about their own history.

All 3 films dive fearlessly into territories that are difficult for many of us because they challenge our beliefs--which can be threatening. Certainly, to truly begin to understand the events it requires a great deal of thought and a vast storage of memory--but these documentaries take giant leaps into asking the right questions and should leave your brain cells rattling a bit as you realize some of the many theories which directly EXTINGUISH the OSWALD MYTH. (if you have not seen them all docs are FREE on youtube--just be advised to make sure you are watching the FULL version...example: the full version of MLK (part 6) in "E of R" is hard to find and also has rare, shocking photos of lynchings which are presented in a historical context to show the vicious racism which existed into the middle of the 20th century).
