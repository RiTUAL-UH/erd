Mac Pro has 2 x 6 pin power supply leads which provide 75 watts each, so I'm wondering if anyone is aware of a GTX 970 variant which accepts 2 6 pin power leads rather than a single 8 pin. 

Have tried an ASUS Strix with a 6 pin to 8 pin converter, and it works but the card doesn't run anywhere near full power. Novabench scored it at 189 when other similar cards score in 1400 range. 




























































































































































































































































































 Graphics card are not my strong suit, so I'm not certain if I should buy the [Palit](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Palit-Nvidia-GeForce-Graphics-Express/dp/B00NPRH3P0/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8 qid=1423792473 sr=8-4 keywords=gtx+970), [MSI Twin Frozer](http://www.amazon.co.uk/MSI-GTX-970-Graphics-Express/dp/B00NOP536Y/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1423792473 sr=8-1 keywords=gtx+970), [Superclocked EVGA](http://www.amazon.co.uk/EVGA-GeForce-Superclocked-Cooling-Graphics/dp/B00NSXYEQW/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8 qid=1423792473 sr=8-5 keywords=gtx+970), or [somthing else](http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=sr_nr_p_76_0?fst=as%3Aoff rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Agtx+970%2Cp_76%3A419158031 keywords=gtx+970 ie=UTF8 qid=1423792306 rnid=419157031). UK Buyer with c. 300 to spend.

Not a daily gamer the main purpose is to drive a triple monitor setup for CAD and graphics work with a few hours Borderland 2 and similar. Other cards happily considered.

Machine is a 12 core dual processor Xeon with SSD and 32Gb RAM. I currently have twin OC 9800 GTX+ in a non SLI setup, which lets the machine down these days. 






















































 In an earlier post I mentioned that I'd been an F1 for the better part of four decades and that this period included Mansell vs Prost, Senna vs Prost, Hakkinen vs Schumacher, Villeneuve vs Pironi, Jones vs Reutemann, Hill vs. Schumacher and much more.

Some of my favorite moments are [Mansell carrying Senna](http://www.f1fanatic.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/1991_mans_asenn_silv.jpg) over the finish line in the 1991 British Grand Prix, [Hakkien overtaking Schui at Spa in 2000](http://youtu.be/-eE3gCy5zvM) and Lauda's title deciding 11th to 2nd comeback drive at [Estoril in 1984](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_Portuguese_Grand_Prix)

 Many people think that distribution of money is to blame for the troubles on the F1 grid. This is a brief explanation of how the money actually works (and why even distribution wouldn't make much difference to the mid-field teams).

The profit is split 60/40 in favor of the teams (63% of 1.18 billion in 2012 and around 60% of 1.4 billion in 2013). The remainder is then split again into two types of payment and distributed among the 11 teams after Ferrari receive an ex-gratia payment ( this was $17.5 million in 2013).

- Category 1 payments which are shared EQUALLY if you finish inside the top 10 for 3 years in a row.
- Category 2 payments which are based on racing performance but require being in the top 10 WCC at the end of the season.

**2013 Distribution**

- In 2013 10 teams received $34.12 million in Category 1 payments. 

- Marusia didn't get anything because it had not yet had three seasons in the top 10. 
- Caterham didn't get any Category 2 money because it was outside the top 10. 


- Of the teams allegedly in trouble now Sauber got $58 million, Williams $51.2 million, Force India $64.8 million, Lotus $71.62 million. 


- Of the bankrupt teams Marussia got $13.6 million, and Caterham $34.12 million.


**Equal shares**

If the fund had been shared equally each team would have received $62 million - which is not enough to make a serious difference to Sauber, Force India or Williams - in-fact Force India and Lotus would have received LESS.

This is a big difference for the bottom two teams, but not much difference for the mid-field ones. F1 teams don't go under for the lack of a few million, they go under for the lack of tens of millions.

**2013 Prize Money List** 

- Red Bull $98.97m 

- Mercedes $88.72 

- Ferrari $96m 

- Lotus $71.62m 

- McLaren $68.22m 

- Force India $64.8m 

- Sauber $58m 

- Toro Rosso $54.6m 

- Williams $51.2m 

- Marussia $13.6m 

- Caterham $34.12m


To provide some idea of costs, Caterham is spending $60 million a year, Mercedes is spending $300 million. HAAS is entering in 2016 with a planned first season budget of around $200 million.

The real problem is costs, and even then this only applies to teams that don't have any other underlying business backing the team. 




 I'm in the market for secondhand card. 

- It has to be NVidia (its destined for a Mac Pro and drivers are more widely available).
- It has to be one card, or so cheap I can afford 2 - no SLI with OSX
- It needs to support 3 monitor outputs.
- I have a budget of 200.  














 I've wanted a genuine Mac to replace my somewhat unreliable Triple Monitor Hackintosh for some time, and I've been looking at 2012 Mac Pro's for around 1300.

However I found a 2009 4,1 2.66 GHz Quad Core Xeon/8Mb/GT 120 512Mb at a second hand store for 249, knowing they sell for 4 - 600 on eBay I snapped it up. 

It benchmarks  around 8000, my existing system is around 12500. Because its the single core model the only economic upgrades right now are to the 4 core Westmere 3.33 W3580 and an NVIDIA GTX 780 6GB which come in at around 450 which means it will loosely match my Hackintosh minus USB3 and SATA 6Gb. 

An upgrade to the 12 core model comes in at 500 with the graphics card and processor that tops out at 1050, at which point I may as well have bought the 2012 model which is better in some respects.

Main pro is that it gives me a genuine Mac to fill in the gap while I save for a 2013 Mac Pro or better. Main con is the loss of SATA 6Gb and USB 3.0. 

Help me out Reddit what would you do?
