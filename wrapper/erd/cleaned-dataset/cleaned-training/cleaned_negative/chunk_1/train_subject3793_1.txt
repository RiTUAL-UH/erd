 Well, that was fast. 




 Named Arf Vader! 




 Yeah, but... is the health inspector a zombie too? 




 Perhaps he just alters his density. 




 Okay, so he's a legit butcher as well as a creepy zombie brain drug dealer? 




 In Eobard's defense, he didn't have time to bury Wells anywhere else, nobody suspected Wells was dead, and the first rule of murder is *never move the body*. 




 Okay. So next week Joe decides to just rob a bank. "Oh, it was... uh... my evil twin. Because there's this super speedy guy, so why not evil twins?"

And the week after that Singh burns down a building. "Oh, that happened because... of... a flaming ghost pig. I mean, there are shapeshifters, so why not ghost pigs?"

Just because weird things can happen, it doesn't follow that they did happen. 




 But this is the couple that is suing. 




  How strange would it be for a guy with a phd etc., to donate sperm? Pretty darned strange.

No, not really. You can make good money that way. Lots of people with degrees are unemployed or underemployed. Gotta pay off those student loans *somehow*. 




 They don't know Wells knows they know, though. Because they're stupid. 




  I don't think any kid thinks being sick or in pain is "cool", and I'm sure that once they're older than three or so they're aware that this is why people take medicine. 




 Good job, Eddie, for telling Iris at least part of the truth. You get a cookie.

Everybody else? WHY DO YOU KEEP TALKING ABOUT WELLS AT STAR LABS? That can *not* be a good idea. You fools! 




 That almost looks like it could be a real word.  




 2024 isn't as future-y as it sounds, not anymore. 




 Did you think she was just hiding around the corner the whole time...? 




 That love story certainly would be worse than most, because ew. 




 No doubt they dropped the curtain on it when they saw her coming up the elevator. Down the elevator? 




 The kids at elementary school love to play "blastoff" which involves jumping off of things, and the main character's father is, among other things, famous for smuggling a peanut butter sandwich onto the space shuttle because he was tired of astronaut food, even though of course there's the issues of crumbs. 




 I think it's more important to model appropriate pain management than to model false stoicism. 














 I can see how you got that idea, but in truth there are people who really will argue, for example, that painkillers are unnecessary during circumcisions because "they can't feel pain" or "it doesn't hurt like it would an adult - they just cry a little and forget". 




 LOL, it happens :) 












































 Did you mean to say that you're NOT knocking weed? 




 No, they think it's okay for medical uses. Some applications of marijuana for medical reasons, like cannabidiol, don't have THC and thus won't get you high.

 Yeah, if those were medicinal. 




 Hm. Maybe The Enchanted Forest Chronicles, Patricia C. Wrede? 

























































































 Peeing in the street is unlawful, and certainly unhygienic, but criminal? Not so much. What's criminal is the fact that there aren't enough facilities for people so they don't need to resort to nature's method. 




 Okay, it's a stupid law, but why were you walking around 24 times with a cup of beer after the first arrest? 




  she SHOULD be in an adult prison. she is dangerous

By that argument, every 36 year old dude who sold some pot should be in a juvenile facility. 




 Just checked wikipedia. Series 1 was released in 2010, Series 2 in 2012, the Christmas mini-episode in 2013, and series 3 in 2014. Series 4 is expected for 2016, so they're going about two years between series (using, of course, the British term instead of the American). 



























































 Although public urination is super gross, I feel like a better solution than fines is more public bathrooms in safe, more-or-less clean locations.

If it is decriminalized, I hope they have some plan for that. 




 Well, the place where the WTC is now was underwater in the 1400s. So you wouldn't. 




 Maybe they just don't like you. 




 Looks more like a rag than a legitimate news source. 




 Perhaps actual news from actual news sites? I mean, this might as well come from a friend-of-a-friend on Facebook. 




   Many don't sit down on the toilet but instead poop while standing on the toilet seat.

Just like how in the US, many don't sit but hover over it. People think it's cleaner because, you know, no butts. And I wouldn't be surprised if some of those people are simply more used to squat toilet.

  And they don't use toilet paper so instead wash their butts in the sink ala bidet.

I always did think toilet paper was a funny custom. If I get poop on my hands, I don't wipe at them with a piece of paper, I get them wet and scrub them down with hot water and soap! 




 Yes, it does, but I think we all eat things that aren't chock full of vitamins from time to time. 




 Oh, it's nothing. I award myself one fake internet point every time I get a book right on the first shot, so I'm motivated!
