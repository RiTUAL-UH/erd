 Kinda reminds me of the Axe Flinger. Deals 2 damage to the face for each hit. Nice idea though! 




 Wanna try a new game, but have no idea how to quit this one. Is there some way to end the subscription? I was born with the "Depression" feature and it makes playing this game really boring. 

Anyone know of any better games to play?
