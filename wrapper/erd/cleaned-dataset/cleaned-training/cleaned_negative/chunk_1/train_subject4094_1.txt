 But it is an exterior wall and its above a natural gas fireplace.  Although the fire goes backwards rather than, so there is nothing behind the TV.

And do you count component or HDMI as running power?  Because I have no plans of running any sort of power cables. 




 Awesome thanks for the reply

Hey Guys,

Included is a picture of my living room.  As you can see in the picture I
have a tv over a fireplace.  My plan is to build built in shelves and
cabinets on either side.  I'd like to hide all the electronics in one of
the cabinets, and run HDMI and component cables through the wall so it
looks good.


So basically what I am trying to do is put the wall plates behind the tv,
and then somewhere to the left lower down that would eventually be behind a
cabinet.  This way I could easily plug in stuff to the tv without having to
re-run wires every time while always keeping them hidden.


So as far as I know, certain power cables need to be regulated for being
placed in walls for whatever reason.  I don't plan on running any power,
just HDMI and component cables.  Do they need to be a specific kind to be
run in the wall?  Or will what I have purchased work for what I have
planned?  I appreciate any help you can provide.  Also not sure if this is relevant but that wall is an exterior wall with insulation in it.

List of cables and wall plates I purchased for this

* [High-Speed HDMI Cable]

* [Component Cable Wall Plate]

Thanks for the help guys 




 I want to do it as the alpine system leaves something to be desired.  However I would like to put Tuffy lock drawers underneath the front seats.  I wonder if it would fit under the backseat. 




 So what do we think, would this [cold weather package](http://www.amazon.com/AAA-Severe-Weather-Road-Kit/dp/B00EBT7ZBI/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top?ie=UTF8 colid=1XLTYKTXP4S5U coliid=I2KXCMELIRU3KZ) suffice?  Thinking about buying it for my jeep. 




 Ok some quick questions how quickly does registration fill up?  I see it is limited to 100 vehicles so when does that typically fill up?

As of right now my 2013 Wrangler Unlimited Sport is completely stock.  I have intentions of adding mods to it but have no idea what if anything will be done between now and this event.  Will it be able to handle the trail stock?  Or should I focus on some specific mods like skid plates between now and the event? 




 So your saying you have an NSX for sale? 




 Christ they don't make it easy to find the website do they?

the website is www.traxion.me to make it easier for everyone. 




 I hope I am posting in the right area, I looked at other subreddits and this seems to make the most sense.  I close on my house on July 2nd and have big plans to make it my own.

I want to do such things as put up a wood fence, build a custom desk that is built into the wall, for two things off the top of my head.  I am sure there are many more things I will need tools for but what are the basic things to get started?

Also I think it would make sense for this to be on the sidebar, or some sort of getting started DIYer list.

EDIT:  So far thanks for all the responses I was a little concerned this would come off as a newb question and get downvoted to oblivion but so far some really helpful info.   




 That's so simple that's brilliant.  Totally makes sense but I in all honesty never would have thought of that.

A beautiful scripture :)
