 Cyman: They're quite oppressive. We are each partnered with agents during missions, though we typically go in solo depending on the situation. We're monitored 24/7 with no contact to the outside world, including social media or any contact with those of us who have remaining family. So, to answer your question, they're quite effective at keeping their collar around our necks and make us do their bidding. 




 BB: Superhero is a general term. As for being heroes, I guess it depends on your perspective of the situation.

Lumen: We save peoples' lives. Not all of those who are like us are the good guys, dude. 

Shell: And who says we're the good guys, Lumen?

Cyman: Guys, relax. We do hunt and detain those like us. It's a fact, but we also have a secret agenda. We stay in contact with those who haven't been warped by their abilities and still retained a moral compass while staying in DC (Detainment Center), and they are putting together a movement to help overcome the government oppression. 




 Lumen: I already suggested it. Shell punched me in the arm - I couldn't use it for a week. 




 Cyman: US. 




 Cyman: We were brought together by a secretive department of the government. As more homo-superiors sprouted, they realized they needed as task force capable of going in, stopping the threat, and bringing it in.

Lumen: We all met after each of us went through a series of tests. We've been together ever since.

Cyman: We've been told that there won't be any need to add new members, but there's a Beta team. 

Lumen: Things are heating up here. More and more Superiors are popping up and coming out the woodwork, so we needed a secondary team to help out. 

Aggie: I've heard there's even a similar team in India. I thought about asking to be transferred, but I figured there would be problems with International relations if I was sent to another country with all the American Intelligence I have encountered. 




 My codename is Lumen. I'm the youngest of the crew, and I came up with all our codenames. I have the ability to project blasts of light, become invisible, create illusions, and shoot an intense laser ray (though it leaves me completely weak unless I absorb more like from the Sun). I'm comic relief, even if my jokes are bad. I'm also good at creating distractions. Feel free to ask us anything!
***

I'm Cyman (I didn't choose the codename, as Lumen already stated). I can calculate probabilities in my head faster than any computer or technological advance in the world, but it has overheated my brain, leaving me half human and half robot, of sorts. I have a cooling system routed along my back and over my bald head (reminiscent of subdermal body mods) which runs on a battery pack attached to my belt. I do not sleep due to the constant calculations in my head, so I focus by playing the drums. The chair I sit in helps charge the battery pack at my belt. Due to my ability, I lead the team of five and make gameplans almost on the fly.
***

I'm Shell. Not all that original when you consider my given name, but whatever. I'm a former detective that worked in one of the most dangerous metropolitan areas in the world. Unfortunately, due to my bad temper, and my freakish ability to withstand practically all forms of punishment, I was forced to quit and given a spot on the team. My skin is incredibly hard and numb, making it difficult for anyone to hurt or cause me pain. So I'm the bodyguard. There. I'm done.
***

Good day. I'm Aggie, short for not only my God-given name, but for my codename given to me by Lumen: Aggregator. I'm originally from Bangladesh, India, but I moved to the US in hopes of continuing my education in neurology focusing in the olfactory senses. I have the unique ability to create various types of pheromones that produce a number of different results: attract, focus, dispel, and even put to sleep. Unfortunately, I have an intense sense of smell and it makes it difficult living in today's society filled with intense scents. Excuse me but someone walked in reeking of Stetson. * blegh *
***

Lumen calls me BB, short for Blood Brother. As a former medical student, I have the ability to control blood cells. This ability allows me to heal and even cause pain, though I try not to unless the situation is dire. I've even used my ability to release endorphines and adrenaline in the bodies of my teammates to give them a super boost. I prefer to stay on the sidelines, but I'm deeply devoted to these guys as they're the only family I have left. 




 Me: Self-loathing, feel unworthy, gullible, sweet, humorous, wants to be good at something, strives to make everyone happy, selfish, loves food, lonely

Story: "Shh, shh, shh, little birdie," he whispered in the kidnapped man's ear. He held the older man close as they both lied next to each other on the bed. Poor Jordie, he always preferred older men and he finally found himself the perfect man: forty-year-old Ritchie Dorn.

Ritchie, a graphic designer at a small downtown marketing firm, met Jordie when the late-twenty-something worked briefly at the firm answering phones and running errands. He remembered disliking the round, pudgy young man right away. He was loud, obnoxious, yearned for attention, and he always talked. It made things difficult to concentrate at work. It was upon Ritchie's suggestion to the owner, Mr. Benewith, that Jordie be let go. He thought that would be the last he'd see of the annoying little brat.

He stared at Jordie who snuggled into the space between his neck and shoulder, eyes closed, feigning sleep. His bloodshot green eyes bulged as he wished he could loosen his hands and free himself of this torture.

"You'll never leave," Jordie said, as if reading the other man's mind. He opened his walnut-shaped blue eyes and his sweet nature turned sour. "I know you dislike me. But I like you and you have no choice but to enjoy your time with me. Because this is it, Ritchie. This is your end. Your last moments will be spent with me before I finally put you out of your misery."

Jordie got up from the mattress and stood at the end of the bed, over Ritchie as he continued speaking: "Trust me. I know I'm no picnic to spend with, but I'm a good person... well, I try to be. I'm not near as bad as you think, really. I promise to make it as enjoyable within my means." His eyes focused on Ritchie's. "But I'm getting what I want out of this." He gripped the golden-tinted bedframe as his mind spaced while feelings of abandonment filled him. "I'm tired of being alone."

"I know," Ritchie said. "I've been lonely too-"

Jordie banged his fist against the frame, causing the rounded pipe at the top to bend in. "SHUT UP. Don't do that. Don't try to empathize with me. You're not being released. You're not going to be given freedom. This is my time, my gift to me. Nothing you say will change my mind. So just accept your fate, Mr. Dorn. Because from today to the end of your life, you're mine." 




 Uplifting that he got a job and people were so kind to him. Unfortunate that he's working for a company that chooses to use its money against US citizens who deserve to be treated equally. 




 Everyone keeps saying Sushi Train but it's never fresh. It doesn't taste great. It's sub-par but cheap. 

I prefer Tokyo Sushi at 71st and Garnett near Fox   Hound and Mexico Lindo. Typically quiet. Service can be slow if crowded, but that's only happened twice. They have $25 unlimited sushi, but it isn't a buffet.

You get a menu which pretty much has all the rolls you can think of, including stir fry, fried rice, lo mein, and hibachi options. There's salads, appetizers, and deserts on the menu also. It's all made fresh to order. I've never had a bad experience and I've gone about 10-15 times in the past 3 years since I moved back from Ohio.

I never tried anywhere else, so I'm not saying there aren't other good places. But $25 unlimited food just cannot be beat when it's made fresh as you order with quality ingredients. At first, the hostess comes off a little cold and impersonal, but she's just focused on her job. One day, I sat down and spoke with her for about an hour because she wanted help in finding online option for english-speaking programs to help her sons learn English (I had been watching Netflix). I told her about Netflix and all the options, including the PBS children's programming that had a lot of edutainment shows. She also knows I bring a lot of people in and has been incredibly considerate to me.

So that's my story. It seems like people get really defensive about their sushi restaurants here. To each their own. 




 The past month-and-a-half I've been trying to keep everything together. I'm 27, living with my gambling parents for the past 3 years while dealing with my own gambling problem and depression. I've lost my best friend due to gambling (and her own personal problems), lost many jobs due to not being able to pull myself out of the deep emotional shit hole I'm in, and I'm ready to literally take my vehicle and wrap it around the nearest telephone pole if things don't start calming down.

My 19-year-old niece and her fiancee have moved in with us into a tiny two bedroom house. They're sleeping in the dining room we've converted into a faux-bedroom for the time being. I do not like my niece's fiancee because he's 22, shows immense jealousy over the stupidest shit, and he finds things to tattle about on people which just isn't helping the situation. I helped get the two of them a job at my work and he starts next week while my niece starts in 2 weeks. Sadly, this means very little money for anything, including the gas I'm using to transport them back and forth once work starts for them. And my parents refuse to help.

My parents originally made somewhere between $30-32/hr until my mom lost her job. She refuses to look for another job and is waiting for unemployment to come in. When I didn't have a job, she expected the house to stay clean. Now that she's unemployed, she just uses my niece and her fiancee to keep everything clean. She also has a ton of personal and check loans at various companies and with family members. My father owes my great-aunt $7000. The two of them blame me for living with them for the past 3 years for the reason they are in debt even though the bills haven't gone up since I lived there. There were times they didn't buy any groceries because they said it would motivate me to keep a job. It did not because it only fueled my depression to the point where I would take a prescribed sleeping pill, sleep, wake up and take another sleeping pill, and sleep. I ate a tablespoon of peanut butter a day and a few crackers in order to stay alive for about 2 weeks until they finally got tired of not having any food in the house and started buying them again.

I'm not a victim. I'm really not. I should be able to keep a job, and I should move out of my parents' house. I never had them pay for anything of mine (gas, car insurance, or telephone bill). I have tons of debt from various accounts being shut off due to nonpayment. My parents have turned things on in my name as well and they decided not to pay them because I never paid any rent. This was during periods when I didn't have a job and they promised to pay the bills. I will never turn anything on again unless it's for me and I know I have the money.

This past month-and-a-half I've been doing really well with my gambling habit. I haven't gone; I've been seeing a therapist that focuses on gambling; and I've self-banned at the area casinos. All my money has gone towards my personal bills, getting caught up where I can, and food for five in the house.

Last night, my niece told me she didn't want to move out with me any longer despite working towards that since she moved in. It was going to be so easy to move out together, the three of us. Now, I have to adjust my priorities and try to save and get out on just my own which will be difficult since I don't make much money. Then, I was notified that my two nephews (20 and 16) keep coming over to eat dinner despite my 20 year old nephew making more money than all of us and their mother (whom they live with) recently winning $7000. I asked them via text to please stop coming over to eat at our house until we can get back on our feet, unless they bring food to help cover themselves. Normally, I wouldn't care, but providing for two weeks of food for five people when nobody else is helping cover these expenses has been a huge stress as my mom keeps telling me I need to move out. 

My mother tells me this morning that my father will not have me telling anyone they cannot eat at "their house". He's sticking up for my 20 year old nephew who does actually help my parents a lot with a lot of physical stuff around the house. He also lets my dad borrow his game systems and stuff to play games. So I get this idea of standing up for my nephew, but my younger nephew is a thief (he's stolen my dad's PS3 before, including my Motorola RAZR MAXX) and I work evenings during dinnertime. I am not there to keep an eye and making sure nothing is taken. And again, I'm the one footing the bill. But my parents don't see it that way. It's "their house" and it's "their rules". Fine. Then, I'll take "my food" and I'll eat "my food" and nobody else can touch "my food". 

I used to pay rent every week when I worked at 18-22 years old until my parents became gamblers. Now, my money will not go towards their gambling habit. They'll have extra money while I pay the bills to help fund their addiction, and I'm not having it. I am fighting my own addiction. My money is no longer going to the casino or helping anyone else fund their trips to the casino.

Am I being incredibly unfair? I don't expect my parents to help, but I do need help. I have nowhere else to go or turn to until I can get out on my own. And I'm not going to rush out and get a place just because they're tired of having people in their space. I didn't invite my niece and her fiancee to stay with us; my mother did. I want to move out right and make sure I don't have to come back. Is that really so much to ask? 




 What's that thing on your neck? 

At 14, I got a pimple on my neck and I popped it, but a small lump stayed behind. As I grew in size, with a 330 lbs body, my fat face hid the thing on my neck pretty well. Then, I lost thirty pounds and my face became a lot slimmer and it's more visible. Everyone asks about the lump.

It's probably a cyst or something odd. I don't have insurance, haven't had insurance, but I am planning on visiting the doctor after my 90-days and I get benefits from my company. But it's annoying having to explain that this disgusting, weird tumor on the side of my neck is actually a disgusting, weird tumor-like lump thanks to not properly popping it at 14-years-old. 




 I apologize if I made any assumptions based on anything you wrote. I may have jumped into it too excitedly. If you still do not mind, let me go ahead and respond.

Killian - Maybe it was how I worded it, but I thought I got the gist of what you were saying. I was agreeing that his transformation didn't work, but I was trying to make the argument that it isn't much of stretch for a narcisstic, selfish guy to become a bad guy. Somehow, we, as the audience, accepted it easily, but people had issues with Killian becoming a bad guy because he's mostly being a bad guy for narcisstic, selfish reasons. Thanks to "All Hail the King", we learn that the REAL Mandarin is out there, and I would say he's the actually schemer at the Nexus of Terrorism. Killian was merely a filler as the bad guy in IM3, and that's sad. The writers focused on Ben Kingsley's Mandarin, but they used him merely as a front. So, I agree with your comment, but again I was able to look past the villain's background and purpose to enjoy the action of the movie.

Tony   Pepper - As I said before, the writer didn't focus on the relationship aspects in the story. Is it really a stretch for a couple to argue over these kinds of things? No. But it wasn't written well.

PTSD - I'm not an expert either, but an adrenaline focus due to his partner being kidnapped may allow him temporary control over his psychological well-being. So it isn't much of a stretch that along with learning how to cope during his time with the kid that he may have temporary control of when his PTSD hits. Of course they're using the PTSD as a gimmick, and it isn't all that realistic, but it makes the character human and this film has been dealing a lot with Tony dealing with his humanity. Are we watching an action movie hoping they are being realistic with their psychology? Further, Tony is a genius. He may be able to wrap his mind around the issue and push past it, but he needed someone to put a metaphorical mirror to his face (the kid did that). As for the end of the movie, it was a montage so we're not exactly sure how long it's been and whether he's truly okay or not. The after-credits scene shows Stark using Banner as a therapist, so he may still be suffering from PTSD.

Extremis - Totally understand. I agree. 

The Suits - I did accidentally miss the main point you were hitting in your original comment. But I do agree with you about how easy it was to destroy the suits. However, I will say that these suits may have been more prototypes than actual suits he would use to fight against a bad guy in a one-on-one fight.

Mandarin - Okay, I get what you're saying now. I didn't get "what's the problem?" from Slattery when Tony confronts him. He's just saying, "How could I not take such an incredible job?" He knows he's scum of the earth, but he wasn't respected. Now, he is, though it's less as an actor and more as a terrorist. At least, that's how I took it.

Pepper's Death - She's shown how fiery (metaphorically) she can be. She has to be to deal with Tony, after all. Sure, she tends to have control, but she just fell to her death after being kidnapped by a dude she never liked in the first place. As well as tortured since she was injected with Extremis. So I can see her going off and using her newfound abilities. 

Again, I was able to suspend my disbelief, but you were not. It's understandable.  









 I hope you do not mind me commenting and making a few of my own observations based on what you provided.

Killian- He is technically a bizarro Stark. Why is it okay for Stark, a selfish, narcissistic guy, to become a superhero but not for Killian, a selfish, narcissistic guy, to become a villain? It's because Stark charms us. Killian unfortunately doesn't have the same rapport with the audience and I feel other things were focused on (his infatuation with Pepper) than actually having an interesting reason to go against Tony (other than he knows how to fix Extremis). 

Tony   Pepper - We're out of the Honeymoon phase, folks. Things happened in IM2 and The Avengers which left the two characters in very different places. We had a brief glimpse of CEO Pepper in IM2 and The Avengers, but she's much busier. Tony, obviously, is dealing with PTSD and feeling human for once. He doesn't want to be around Pepper in such a vulnerable time. If memory serves, Pepper mentions him being away a lot, keeping busy on building suits. So the two already have a divide. Tony can't sleep, and that likely may be the only time the two spend together since Pepper's become so busy. Lastly, I think the writer just merely didn't focus heavily on their relationship, as it only becomes crucial when Pepper almost dies during the house being blown up or when she's kidnapped and injected with Extremis.

The PTSD - I honestly don't think he's completely over it. He's just learned how to cope better. Plus, he had a bit of a big situation on his hands: Pepper's kidnapped and he has a bad guy to find. At the time, it was Mandarin/Ben Kingsley. Then, it became Killian/Mandarin.

Extremis - I honestly thought it made the human characters quite disposable. Sure, it doesn't make too much sense, but the inventor does explain in the beginning of the movie how Extremis has a bizarre side effect she doesn't understand. Tony left her a quasi-cure where he was on the right track but not enough time to finish. There's a few things the script leaves completely blank as they wanted to focus more on action than say science. But Tony does obviously find a way to save Pepper.

The Suits - Tony built all those suits in hopes of finding the one perfect suit to make him immortal. As I referenced before, the events in New York left him feeling incredibly human, something he hasn't experienced before both as Iron Man or prior to becoming a superhero. Sure, Iron Man 1 did touch on it, but he still had an extreme focus and self-assuredness to help build the very first suit in the cave. In IM3, we have a very unsure Tony who has questioned whether he deserves to be a part of the Post-Avengers superhero world. At the end, he realizes that he doesn't need all the suits and he also realizes how his technology can get away from him and be used for evil, as shown in IM2. So he destroys them. It's Tony realizing it isn't the suit that makes him Iron Man, or the arc reactor. It's the MAN.

Mandarin - I was let down briefly that Ben Kingsley turned out to play an actor rather than a real terrorist. The Dark Knight Rises already showed us what happens when terrorism hits close to home on a huge level. I preferred not going over the same material. Sure, it was a letdown, but the comic version of the character does use many fronts to hide his identity. In reference to your question about Kingsley being surprised, I think it's more that he's had guards surrounding him 24/7 since he started this role. He didn't expect Tony with MacGuyver tools and a glock in his face. He expected Iron Man with pulsers to blow his head off. I'd be surprised too to see some random billionaire/genius/playboy/philanthropist pop up out of nowhere as I was having fun with two people in bed in the middle of the day with a gun in my face. Wouldn't you?

Pepper's Death - Phony? Yes. Cheap? A little. But did it make me love the character more? Fuck yes. Pepper always had some fire to her. In the comics, she becomes Rescue (an Iron Woman, if you will), so it isn't completely unheard of for her to become a complete and total badass. Extremis obviously has some side effects in making people super strong, agile, superhuman, so again it isn't much of a reach to see Pepper jump up out of nowhere and do some pretty insane flips and shit. Also, it's just pretty and makes for a great scene. 

Summary: You have valid points. I disagree with how severe they are, and I'm able to suspend my disbelief, but you weren't and that's okay. To each their own.

 




 Today, I merely wanted to sleep in a little longer than normal. It was a mere fifteen minutes, just a quarter of an hour of not really sleeping (as my alarm had gone off) and more just lying in bed enjoying the warmness wrapped in my blankets as the sun shines in my bedroom window. I took the fifteen minutes, but this meant I needed to hurry it up: eat food, make lunch, take shower, and drive to work. However, I also have to worry about my 20-year-old nephew who lives and works with me. 

He takes forever gathering his things before getting into the car. We now only have 20 minutes to get to work, where we're still new and in training. It also happens to be our 3rd time being late meaning we would get a write-up. So I choose to speed. 

I'm at my exit and ready to get off, but I'm pulled over by a highway patrolman. He gives me a ticket for $175, but he did help out by reducing how fast I was originally going. I was going 76 in a 65 and he put me down as 74. So I appreciate that, but I still haven't gotten paid in my new job.

Let's not mention my gambling addiction; my gambling parents demanding I give them money as soon as I get paid; the fact that my passenger window won't roll up today because the motor died; a new phone bill I have due on my first paycheck; car insurance; my car actually dying on me while driving; or the fact that I feel completely alone and nobody in my corner on my side.
