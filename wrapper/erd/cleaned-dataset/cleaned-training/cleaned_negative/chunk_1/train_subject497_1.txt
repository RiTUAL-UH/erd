 thank you very much for your "2 cents". :) 
  




 Hello everybody :) 

This topic really keeps playing on my mind right now, but I didn't really wanted to post this question on facebook to get some answers. So I thought, why not ask my infp fellows here on reddit? It's the best place on earth!

Now sarcasm seems to be something where opinions tremendously differ on: 
For some, sarcasm is extremly hurtful and with always a bad intention, an expression of verbally sadistic, narcisstic people (now don't get me wrong, this is definitely not my opinion). 
For others, it's a way of communication, with which the sarcastic person is playing down his/her emotions verbally (to the outside), but still kind of hurt inside. By being sarcastic and playing down the feelings, the person is trying to kind of protect himself/herself from negative reactions.(Can you see this as an introverts trait?)
But for some it just seems to be a humorous style with no bad intentions, or even an awesome kind of humor! 

Please tell me what **you** think of it! :) Maybe you have a totally different opinion on sarcasm! I'm extremely curious to hear. :) 

(I apologise in advance for any mistakes! Unfortunately, English is not my native language.) 




 Sounds awesome! I'm glad for you. :) 




 This helps me, too. :) Also, darkening the room and lots of fresh air!
