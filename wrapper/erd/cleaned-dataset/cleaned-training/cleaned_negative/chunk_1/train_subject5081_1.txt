 It's a copycat industry.  Sometimes it takes a little longer to step up their copying game.
 




 Ecoboost balls. 




 Satire doesn't require an accent. 




 Not true.

 The twist: they're placebos. 




 Blasphemy 




 Is $1100 worth the trouble and risk?
 




 Now look at all the people who aren't upset.  They're less vocal. 

 The show's main stars are the cars.  

The only thing different is that the show isn't advertiser driven, so they can openly criticize and mock companies like Ford, Porsche, whoever.

 There's a reason why ODB had 13 children. 




 Ha.  I thought he just smashed the top tube first then tried sawing it thinking it could be welded back.

I'm guessing he pulled it from the trash (hence the rebar bike stand) or purchased from a police auction where they overbid crap.

I think a professional thief/seller would pull the parts and sell it or put them on another frame.

Maybe I like to think we live in a world where thieves are a bit more savvy.

 "fart" - brain 




 Does age matter to you that much?  You sound like my sister playing the maturity card.

I just don't think comedy has an 100% approval rating.  

He was funny when he cracked on Jim Norton for having a mancrush on Dice.  "Hey Jimmy you want to go to the mall together, ohhhh!" in Dice's voice. 




 Name one funny thing he's said or did besides hacky race comedy which is rarely funny? 




 The old oversell 




 He's a character, not really a comedian nor really funny.   Hannibal is genuinely funny especially in The Eric Andre Show and 30 Rock. 




 "No" - Bill 




 Helmets and pads also teach humility. 




 The developments in the technology of selling and delivering technological goods is important.

Dealers are made into useless middlemen by the internet.

 Buying a Ford car is kinda like suicide.  That's how they became the best selling truck. 




 This was an episode of Mindfreak with Cris Angel 




 I think it's more than plausible he's gay.  You probably can't be openly gay to be on a shitty family sitcom.

He can date and marry much further up the Hollywood food chain yet chooses Diane.  Like he's not interested.

His apartment has all butts.  Not sure of the sex of those butts.

 Bojack doesn't exactly act like a horse, man.  

Dogs can also be gay. 




 There's a lot of girls who look like that around classic car clubs.

Whatever works for them.

edit: and tattoo conventions 




 Modded to the point of consored.  
 




 Dat inside info.  I think he knows all the gym, training, personal life gossip with all these fighters. 




 I forgot this was /r/nfl where everything is serious business.

Yes, I know who Howe is.  Met him once.  He didn't act like a star just an ambassador for the sport.  I thought that was great.  He's big.  Especially for an 'old timer'.
 




 Up high the backlight of these things blind you a bit at night.  

Navigation screens just suck shit in general.  I'd rather have it all dark inside looking out into a well lit path.   




 Does nothing.  A picture is a snapshot of nothing.  

A video tells another story.  You can send that to their safety director and that will do something.  They also talk to all the other safety directors in the area and nationwide.

Semi drivers are on a schedule.  They might not want to drive like shit, but are kinda pushed to. 




 They don't care.  Unless it effects them financially.   




 Abuse of power still comes as no surprise. 




 Lay and pray 




 Gordie Howe, eh?  Never heard of him.

It was actually Gordie who signed for less because the Red Wings "weren't making money" and had to sign his teammates too.

Then they leaked Lindsay's contract that was inflated to discredit him and his attempts to unionize.

Howe became a household name.  Lindsay got railroaded by politics. 




 Scrolling past something you've already seen is hard. 




 There's a hockey movie about how the Red Wings did pretty much the same thing.  As far negotiating salaries.

They won the Stanley Cup then traded away their best player at the time because he tried to start a union.

 /r/mma is worth checking out.  

UFC needs hype-worthy "name" fighters to survive.  Rousey is one of the last one's left.  Concussions, PEDs, gruesome injuries kill their talent quickly.

They pipelined a woman's division for Rousey.  I think she's a bandage to buy time for the UFC to clean up their men's side. 




 The business side of UFC is more interesting than the fighting.

The hyping of Rousey in lieu of all the men getting popped for drugs is pure magic.

But looking at the shit he sells on his site.  He's just a goofball gym guru.

 I think a moving picture meant to be entertaining is pretty similar to another moving picture meant to be entertaining. 




 If velocity and angles and striking position and legitimate goal scoring chances don't matter, then yes you are correct.   




 Probably because you're throwing a 50/50 ball instead of retaining possession. 




 Deliberately.  Still counts.

 If that's what it takes to remain relevant and employable...

 Sorry about your husband.  You'll find another. 




 I don't think deadspin has any reverence for the NFL nor sports in general. 




 Is it open to the public?  I've only been in the lobby. 




 NFL players don't last that long anyway.

If you compared them to other teams I bet the results would be similar. 




 I didn't realize Ed Reed got that many picks 




 Some air for a football? 




 We Patriots fans are kinda emo. 




 They run a 1-6 defense.  There's a need.

 Gawker is what it is.  More like a guilty pleasure.  I just think they want cheap juicy content. 




 Been to a few places.

They usually have flags raised up high to help you see others.  There's a general riding pattern people follow.  Nothing set in stone. 




 Limited hangout?

 No they don't

 Fuck it.  He lit him up.  Sometimes a wild haymaker is a knockout blow. 




 Yeah, it was clean.  The RB didn't pick up the blitz.  Once you get a concussion you get them easier and easier.  He probably took way worse hits than that throughout his career.

 He probably wasn't high.  That's why he was so easily irritated. 




 Speculative.  




 He wasn't high and therefore irritable.

 And it's still weird the dude shills for Acura in it.  You think he'd be more comfortable asking for donations or whatever to maintain it.  It's good PR for every comedian he has on there.   




 Still was a great player offensively.  Defensively he was lucky to have a job.  

The knock always was he was a defensive liability.
