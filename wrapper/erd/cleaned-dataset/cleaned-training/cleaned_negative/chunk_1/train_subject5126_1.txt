 7/10 




 Ha! Personally I think monogyny is overrated anyway.  Don't let society pressure you into having to have a bf if it's not what you want. But you're hot, so I'm sure getting what you want shouldn't be a prob! 




 You're young and beautiful.  Please don't go putting on a lot of makeup.  You don't need it and I see so many girls killing they're natural beauty by wearing paint. Also, at 6'4" - I can really appreciate a tall beauty.  9.5/10 




 You're hot. 8/10.  Why do you think you've never had a bf?   




 You're so cute! 7/10 




 Is this thing the size of a truck or is that guy just *really* short? 




 That wasn't a question. It's not efficient to work employees to the point where they kill themselves.  




 8/10 - I'd smash 




 If you're a company making your employees work 100hr weeks you need to create two jobs and hire two people.  Gah. 




 Really. You are a joke and you're hilarious. In a sad way. The other comments ring true and honest. The fact is that I have very high self esteem, I frequently get requests to model, and I'm drowning in pussy. Maybe a slight narcissism exists but there is nothing 'quite tragic' about seeking approval and showing off ones hard earned abs in this sub is to be expected.  Btw; you're full of shit with your obvious contradiction:
 I wouldn't say you're ugly because that is unfair

vs

 you can't accept that you're ugly

You're pathetic.  Get help. 




 Hard work pays off.  Good job. 




 Good one. 




 Enough about some president that was before our lifetime.  Are you on Mount Rushmore?  How will you be forgotten?   




 6/10.  Do some squats or something. 




 Velcro wallets: age 10

Drinking too much: age 25

Not caring about your health: age 30 




 You're a handsome fellow.  7.5/10 




 Athletic high (runners, swimmers, fighters, etc). 




 Carb filler: Brussels Sprouts.  I just eat them raw.  They have a ton of fiber, + some protein, and they fill you up fast and keep you full. 




 You're hawt!  Nice thigh gap.  9.5/10 




 Porn magazines. 




 I agree.  That can't be working for her.  She'll either have to be less of a bitch or be hotter. 




 Stop making a duckface.
That piercing is not flattering at all.
Go with your natural hair color.
6/10 




 I'd eat your ass. 




 It must suck being fat, ugly, and generally unattractive.   




 Undercover shitlord.  I get it. 




 Don't as for honesty if you can't take it.  You're fat, ugly, and age terribly.  Honesty. 




 3/10.  You look like you're in your late 30's.  And you're fat.  And this picture is of horrible quality.   




 Hi.

The website asoftmurmer.com works wonders for me. 




 You're beautiful.  9/10. 




  Step 4: Get new glasses. Those are too small on your face.

OR; get a smaller face.  Your face is too big for your glasses.   




 You look like you're 40.  Are you balding?  
I have a fix: Consume less than you expend (talking calories here).  Repeat this behavior consistently until you are no longer obese.  Then consume as much as you expend.  
 




 Why you Russian, are you late for something? 




 8. I like the bangs but that just might be b/c I live in BK. 




 Good at Google.
