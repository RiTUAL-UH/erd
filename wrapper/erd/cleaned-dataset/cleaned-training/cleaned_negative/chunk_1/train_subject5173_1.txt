 amazing! you are so lucky because you can enjoy such beautiful scene on your way to work. i just meet the crowd of people every day.  




 what's the karma for? 




 so you mean they use the same number in different movies? why? why 555 can not be used? and they can just create a number that doesn't exist.  




 I always do the same thing as you. even if i have watched them for more than once, i still enjoy them when i watch them again! 




 you mean you will watch them again and again?  




 yeah! totally agree with you. Friends is still funny and i do think good sitcoms will never be outdated! besides, i enjoy Good Luck Charlie very much.  




 recently, i have been watching the Friends. but i found some of the plots are unfit for our life now. so i wander if anyone will still choose to watch TV series years before? 




 i like the photos with the natural scenes and this one is good. 




 my friends recommended me to see this TV series and it is really out of my expectation! it is awesome! 




 it is interesting, i am thinking about making a similar one for my boyfriend to give him a surprise.  




 looks delicious and easy to make. i will try it this weekend! 




 i am not quite sure but it seems that i know this scene.  




 It is said that the movie intended to make people pay attention to the protection of wild animals. but i think it might have some backfires.
