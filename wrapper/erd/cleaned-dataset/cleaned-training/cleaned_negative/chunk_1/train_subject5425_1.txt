 I learned the 7/11 breathing method from a counselor...you breathe in for 7 seconds, then out for 11....this will bring a panic attack under control
Hope this helps!

 I certainly don't mean to wait until they are three to read to them, I am just saying by that age they will learn to enjoy chapter books 




 Seems like your food budget is extremely high...you could easily cut that in half I would think 




 I have figured up how much it costs us for mortgage and utilities.  Me and my boyfriend each put $200 in our joint account a week.  Our expenses are about $1200 a month so we have extra in there for home maintenance, a snowblower, lawn mower, etc.  We each pay our own car insurance, cell phones, and 1/2 of the food...keeps things simple, I only write 3 checks a month from the joint account and all the bills are paid. 




 gorgeous!

 Read to your kids alot....as soon as they are 3 or so, start reading chapter books, like just one chapter each night... choose classics like Charlottes Web.  It will give them a love for reading when they learn that  not every story ends in 15-30 minutes...and kids who love to read are smarter, because they learn so much
