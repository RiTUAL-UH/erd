 That's what my friend said! It would be fantastic!  




 Has anyone had an actual lucid dream with the dream Z app? I've tried but with no success. I want to know if I should keep trying or just stick with using an alarm to wake up 5 hours after I sleep.  




 Wouldn't it be great if they played the Rings of Akhaten song, The part where the girl sang? 




 Xlan16 is right. You're never  going to know what happens in your dream. What you should do is try biting your tongue, or try plugging your nose and try to breath. The biting your tongue almost always works for me. Good Luck!  




 More then likely he won't be seeing any of 11 because in an interview he said that he wasn't invited back for the 50th episode, unless they decide to throw him in there before 11 regenerates.  




 I want to be something happy but then sad at the same time. Anyway they do it will be brilliant.  




 Great job, that looks incredible
