 For my fellow ladies who are endowed with fleshy labias- getting your inner lips shoved into your baby hole during sex. It pinches the clit and pulls and ow :( 




 Sorceress, by Celia Rees. I don't know if anyone is familiar with it, but it's the sequel to her first book, called Witch Child. They're more young adult than fiction, but if you are interested in the Salem Witch Trials, I highly recommend both of these books. They're not about Salem, but about colonial era witch superstitions. Anyway, in Sorceress, the girl ends up married to an Native American man named Jaybird, and they have two children, a boy and a girl. I'm not going to spoil what happens, but just the writing is so heartwrenchingly good, I've read this book three times and every time I end up crying.

Also, Before I Fall. Bawled my eyes out.
