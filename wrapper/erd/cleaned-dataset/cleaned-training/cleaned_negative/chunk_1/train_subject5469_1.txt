McGILLAN, JOHN M. "SHORTY" - Delirium Tremens - Died Aug 22, 1891 - Age 30 Years  

He Never Blamed the Booze! 

His liver needed scraping and his kidneys had the gout, He swallowed lots of bitters 'til at last he cleaned 'em out, His legs were swelled with dropsy 'til he had to cut his shoes, He blamed it to the doctors, but he never blamed the booze! 

Then he had the tremens, and he tackled rats and snakes, First he had the fever, then he had the shakes, At last he had a funeral and the mourners had the blues, And the epitaph they carved him ..."He Never Blamed the Booze!"

"An advisory alert has been issued for a remote  volcano in the western Aleutian Islands after dozens of earthquakes were reported in the area, an early sign of volcanic unrest. 

The change means that five volcanoes being monitored in Alaska are now simultaneously active, the most in recent memory, said Matt Haney, a research geophysicist at the Alaska Volcano Observatory. "

Too many quakes from Indonesia to the southern Islands, Chile, Acapulco and volcano related swarms in the Aleutians. 

West Coast, US   Japan needs to be on their toes. 






























































































 /r/StormComing is simply this: an Archive of Earth Changing Disasters and Events, manmade or natural.

It's not a place for HAARPtards, Climate Change Deniers, Flat-Earthers, or Eschatology/Rapturists to post theorems. And as we want to attract sane, logical redditors, we don't want to hear about how radiation is good for everyone.

This sub is best read using 'new' rather than 'hot' or 'top' as it is an archive of events.

We cover these types of global stories:

* Extreme Weather (including watches/warnings), torrential rains, record breaking wind events, temperatures, tornados, hurricanes, etc.

* Geologic: Landslides, earthquakes, sinkholes, etc.

* Floods and flood watches/warnings.

* Solar: Solar Storms that may have impact on Earth.

* Disease: Disease outbreaks of all kinds, including rabies threats.

* Food Recalls.

* Near Earth Objects: Upcoming close encounters with Meteors.

* Mass animal die-offs.

* Nuclear accidents and events.

* Oil and chemical spills/explosions/fires.

* Wildfires.

* Drought and impacts of drought, ie: agricultural impacts, etc.

If you want to add an Earth-changing or disaster story from the news or reliable source, please do. Since headline writers often fail, feel free to editorialize titles to fill in important details from the story- especially the location.

We have already heard from someone who saw a flash flood forecast here that saved them from swimming home from work. Other redditors have been alerted to Tornado Outbreaks and took safety precautions. So we feel we are fulfilling the purpose of the sub.

As /r/StormComing is an archive of events, there is nothing subjective about it. Downvoting anything here would be as stupid as downvoting an encyclopedia entry.

Feel free to x-post to other reddits, especially reddits that are geographically related to the area the event or warning concerns.

If you mod a related sub I'll be happy to share sidebar links. If you would like to co-mod this sub, send me a pm.
