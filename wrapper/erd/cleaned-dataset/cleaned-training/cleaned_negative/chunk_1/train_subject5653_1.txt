 I thought it was great but I hate jump scares. The film was clever, well acted, the child was not annoying to me although I have heard that before.

 Doubt you read it, or ever did, since I am an avid reader and what you describe is wrong.  




 Waiting on the election. 




 I'd say your fanboy love for all things Marvel might be clouding the issue. You obviously don't read the magazine.

 No 




 Hold on. 800$ a month in Estonia? That doesn't sound right. The per person capita in my country is more than twice yours and I live on that. 














 Maybe, interesting view. 




 Totally. Unwatchable. But if we wait 5 years? 




 Millionaire Rolf Harris did the same with less interesting results

 I agree, gave up after 5 episodes. But I thought some people might like to read this. 




 I couldn't. 




 it's a tragedy, but I have to admire the writers enthusiasm  




 Disagreeing with a POV doesn't mean you have to blindly downvote it people.

 You might try /r/shortfilm or a place like that.

At least you went and did it, more than I ever do. 




 Nice find.

 The guy in the photo is not me.

I need money, it brings me happiness.  




 How many hours you have to work to buy your passport I guess. 




 The real truth is he is not good looking enough to get away with this in the court of public opinion. Won't be able to pull a Rob Lowe.

 You know the funny thing, I didn't even know what a Tebow was.

 Oh how insightful. No one would have thought of this response.

 Makes sense. We need a defender, is he any good? Well he can do this. Sold! 




 Yet when I dress up and play with children's balls it's a crime! 




 It's what I would do. For the laugh.

 Why not just tell me the entire fucking movie why don't yeah?

 




 The Shawshank Redemption came to me during a very dark period in my life. I was depressed, had a marriage fall apart and was stuck in a very strange place, a foreign city, a job I detested. Made me realise instead of fighting it to just go through the hole, face the problems, go deeper into it. The film works on several levels aside from the simple prison one. 









 imagine it was, but prob not, unless he was keto 




 Bingo my friend! 




 sound naff really. Like shut up I know my own destiny. 









 I believe it is serrano 









 People still ask that sort of thing?

Funny though nearly every girl I knew who in their early 20s was so thoroughly adamant that they would never get married have.

I wonder if they ask their single friends the same thing. 




 Yeah she is very easy to all in love with. 




 Really? Very disappointed.  




 Nope! It's from a blog page on old guns called The Arms Room. 














 Maps to the Stars was good. I ended up watching 3 films with the actress whose name I can't spell in a week or so. Stoker (5/10), The Double (3/10 mainly for the set design and lighting) and Maps (6.5/10 - the worst DC I have seen but still more interesting than most films, Julianne Moore is amazing in it)

Also saw Batman Vs. Robin and agree with below. Not the best of the recent movies but still good.
