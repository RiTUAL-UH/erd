 "Also, we cannot be arrested or prosecuted under the new statute for recording on-duty government officials who are talking to the public as part of their jobs, because those conversations are not private. The new statute respects the appellate court ruling in the case the ACLU brought against the Cook County States Attorneys Office: on-duty police officers have no reasonable expectation of privacy in their conversations in public places." -- ACLU of Illinois 




 Nipton is in California, and it's why they have lotto tickets. 




 Also... it's not a study, it's a seminar paper. And if you look at the actual statistical analysis and the graphs, it is impossible to support this headline at all. The economists found a statistically significant, but weak negative correlation between religiosity and patents per capita. Meanwhile, other factors, such as education, had strong correlations.

Many 'religious areas' (Egypt, Texas) are 'leaving behind' more secular areas (France, New York), according to the graphs. But really -- since when was an area being 'left behind' because it has a low rate of patents per capita? 




 All this reddit flip-flopping is hilarious. 




 Seems like a good time to note this journal: http://www.jasnh.com/

It's a shame they don't publish more research. There is only one article in their latest issue :(

 I knew people were using EEGs for biofeedback brain training games and whatnot -- but DIY transcranial stimulation? Wow. 




 Whew. Thank Jove!

 This is probably true of other professions, too. 




 I think it would be great, but...

This has been brought up many times. In short, the devs said entering/exiting animations ain't happening because it sucks up too many resources. 




 "Hotel guest Mary Casamento said she called police to the hotel after seeing a 'big dude' yelling at and pushing a petite woman."

Fuck this guy. 




 What resource problem? 




 Not contrails. Those are Vanu chemtrails, creating an atmospheric mirror in the sky so amoral VS scientists can grow their nanite-modified crops. 




 Now that we have redesigned bases and the lattice, I would like to see an-SCU-in-every-base come back. When it was tried in beta, the game was quite different. 




 We will all go together when we go: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frAEmhqdLFs 




 Legislators listen to those who can spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to defeat them in the next election, not angry reddit users. 




 Omni Magburn? Zzzzz. I'd rather have the Spider-Mag come back. 




 The Empire never ended. 




 Why use jump pads instead of stairs or some other type of structure? 




 Please, please, please consider no jump pads. 




 It's called  (Stalker). It's a long and strange movie. You can watch it on YouTube for free, just make sure to turn on captions unless you understand Russian.
Part 1: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYEfJhkPK7o
Part 2: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUHBgqx8YP8 




 It's a good movie too. Unless you have ADHD. 




 What's a Magrider? I only know of Magmowers. 




 Dark nights worked fine in beta. 




 Shocklance. 




 It's a shame that we can't link to the original source. 




 He shot himself and his head popped off and landed on the ground next to him? Looks pretty silly to me. 




 Simple (but annoying) fix: Engineers don't spawn with mines equipped, have to resupply to get them.

Simple (but potentially overpowered) fix: Make Sunderers naturally resistant to mines. 




 OP should have linked to this: http://dougcollins.house.gov/press-releases/house-passes-collins-resolution-to-protect-first-amendment-rights-for-military-chaplains/ 




 I'm sorry, but anyone who uses the term "Gnostic atheist" sounds incredibly ignorant and uneducated to me. A Gnostic atheist would be a person who believes in an evil demiurge but doesn't believe in God? 




 A new study by two York University researchers estimates the U.S. pharmaceutical industry spends almost twice as much on promotion as it does on research and development: http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/01/080105140107.htm 




 New Vegas was full of bugs and glitches. An empty desert is also much less fun to explore than the destroyed ruins of a major city. That is why it got worse reviews. In my opinion, the storyline of New Vegas was far far far better than Fallout 3. But that aspect of the game is really a matter of taste. Some people like the more realistic, morally-ambiguous plot of New Vegas. Others like the more epic, black-and-white plot of FO3. 




 VGS. 




 I'd much rather have new features than new content. 




 I stay on the ground because I have dendrophobia in flight. 




 I didn't say it should be nerfed. I only said it was annoying. It seems like a good pilot can keep his (or her) crosshairs on a ground target regardless of the angle/direction they are flying. I prefer the ESFs that strafe and fly off in the same direction like a WWII fighter -- because they don't kill me. 




 A slight inconvenience to help rescue the life of a child? TYRANNY. 




 As someone who mainly plays infantry, I don't like getting killed by planes that can easily get behind my cover because they magically fly backwards. 




 The original Bella Omega was my favorite map. Not sure why it got so much hate. 




 They really over-emphasized the "gotta go fast" part of Tribes.  




 Bingo 




 I completely support SOE stealing ideas from Tribes, particularly the targeting laser. 




 I don't disagree, but seeing people hit a jump pad and fly through the air while standing up perfectly straight just reminds me of Starsiege: Tribes. It was a cool concept 15 years ago, now it is just goofy. (Fun level is relatively unchanged.)

I wish SOE would remove ALL jump pads and give engineers some sort of deployable (wo)man-cannons instead. 




 Jump pads are silly. 




 You'd face an endless horde of corn and soybean mutants. 




 Slavery has existed all over the world and all throughout history. Slavery in the United States is only notable because it was particularly cruel and brutal for the time. Schopenhauer, for instance, said American slavery "constitutes one of the heaviest indictments against the human race" and North America was "a disgrace to the whole of humanity." The slave trade was a type of brutal mass slavery that hadn't been seen for centuries. 




 You mean lynching? I can't imagine white people ever doing that -- especially not in recent American history. 




 Dammit, HBO.

 And hyperinflation never happened, because Ron Paul believes in fairy tales rather than proven macroeconomic concepts. 




 Ah, ok. Thanks for clarifying. I've studied ancient religions for some time and never encountered Gnosticism used in this way, but it makes sense in this context. 




 Where did you pick up this unique definition of Gnosticism? 




 I think it got picked up by the media because a black teen carrying only skittles was gunned down in the middle of the street and the man who admitted killing him was not arrested... LOL, JK, it is actually a national conspiracy of journalists to repeal a particular statute in Florida state law. 




 Uneducated or just plain dumb? The proposed route runs from San Francisco and Sacramento to Los Angeles and San Diego. $90 billion budget deficit? You mean $4 billion budget surplus?  Every other high speed rail in the world runs a deficit? Ok, except for Great Britain, France, Japan, Australia and, oh, I don't know, the United States (N.Y. to D.C. line.) You're bitching about Perini, however, is valid. 




 Even though there was a lot more to do in terms of quests, FNV felt empty compared to the urban landscape of FO3.  




 Not purely history, but Entitled Opinions is great. 




 It is a well-known fact that empowering women in any and every form is a major contributor to earthquakes. 




 People get very defensive when their primary form of entertainment is questioned. I think the haterage stems from the misperception that she is trying to make people feel bad about enjoying video games. 




 A superb summary. 




 This article is terribly plagiarized from this: http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/07/01/levar-burton-explains-his-ritual-to-prevent-being-shot-by-police/ 




 TIGTA said, "The term 'Progressives' appears, beginning in August 2010, in a separate section of the BOLO listings that was labeled 'TAG [Touch and Go] Historical' or 'Potential Abusive Historical.' TAG is a group within the IRS that processes applications that are potentially related to terrorism or tax abuse... 




 This structure is... different. Blasphemy! Blasphemy! Lord Vanu proclaims there can only be one dozen building designs. 




 I concur. The resource system needs to be fundamentally changed.  I doubt toying around with numbers can solve anything. Increasing resource costs just increases frustration without achieving much else. 




 My current number 1 frustration: repetition. I wish there was more to the game than "Attack point A/B/C, repeatedly endlessly." 




 Besides the Lasher and Lancer, the current infantry weapons don't feel futuristic at all. Hell, most of them seem like they're from the '80s. 




 Completely agree. Infantry caught in the open without vehicle support should be easy pickings for tanks and aircraft. 




 Read some of the abolitionist literature about how slaves were treated in America's "peculiar institution" and I think you'll change your mind. 




 PSA: Just because someone is trying to unearth how one particular gender is portrayed and utilized in video games doesn't mean you can't still enjoy those video games or that you are a bad person for enjoying them.

But you might be a bad person if you attack someone for simply trying to take a critical look at one of the most popular forms of modern entertainment. 




 Tribes:Ascend was getting rave reviews and a flood of free marketing when it first came out. I was able to get many people hooked on the game who had no experience with the Tribes franchise at all. From what I saw, everyone thought it was amazing. 

But I also saw people abandon the game after a few months because they got bored with the lack of variety and the seemingly infinite grind needed to get basic items. A game that is already frustrating for new players should not add to that frustration with a grind. In T:A, you have to either pay good money for items, or play the same damn map over and over again for experience points.

From what I have seen, the game died because of its business model -- not because it was a "niche game." The ONLY complaints I saw (albeit from "casual" players) was the lack of variety and the grind. 




 So, Tribes? 




 NSA obtained a secret court order for telephone metadata. This is a shitty situation, but it wasn't warrantless wiretapping.  




 As someone who feels guilty about frequently using squad deploy to drop on top of tanks and Sunderers, I disagree. There is no way for armor to counter the drop pod engineer-suicide-bomber tactic besides avoiding all combat. 




 No teleporters or jump pads? I approve. 




 Knives are uninspired. I'd rather have one of these: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9z2F0crCWM 




 Is there a prominent liberal who hasn't demanded campaign finance reform? 




 Happens to my Lasher all the time, and the glitch completely breaks iron sights.
