 Almost everything by Simon Armitage is great. His poems capture an enjoyable blend of darkness and humor. 
I quite like this one:

 I think it's best to stick to an idea of a thyme scheme aabbcc can work but often it just sounds busy, maybe try other rhyme schemes but never feel like you have to be confined to it, especially in spoken word. With meter, it can be just a matter of going over it.
Good luck. 




 Happy Birthday, 1951 by Vonnegut is an amazing short story, made me feel many emotions.
