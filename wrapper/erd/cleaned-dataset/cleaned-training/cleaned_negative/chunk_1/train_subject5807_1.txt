 This article gives a pretty good explanation of the study:

 Re-posted to correct misspelling in title. Here's the original paper: http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/am401956s 









 Oh, and here's the original paper: http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/am401956s. 




 Misspelling in title: There should be a "try" between "to" and "some." But your brain probably filled in the gap anyways. Isn't that crazy? 
























 Meh, I'd let the mods decide. Cheers, mate. 




 I agree with a lot of what you're saying, but one thing to also keep in mind is that the experts that you contact will also likely have "agendas and biases," especially if you speak with competing scientists.  




 There's also a great article here when this paper was originally linked to Reddit in June:

 Pretty sure the subjects only did it once. 




 TL;DR of the study:

 Yep. The study was also conducted in vitro, so that could also affect the results. 

What's really interesting here is that short-term exercise produced the hormonal changes with inhibitory effects on cancer cell growth. A previous study showed long-term exercise to have such an effect: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11490320.  



















 Here's the actual paper. It's open-access over at Scientific Reports: http://www.nature.com/srep/2013/130625/srep02066/full/srep02066.html 


































 The piece is based on a recent study from the Scripps Research Institute that looked at cocaine addiction in a rat model. 









 I don't put much stock in computer simulations, but this is quite a provocative theory that makes some intuitive sense. 









 Yep. And according the the article, the researchers were working with low doses of psilocybin in a controlled environment. Self-medicating in an uncontrolled environment with higher doses may not be effective at all, and may instead be deleterious.  



















 Yep! I'm super pumped. 




 In general, science television today is but a shadow of a shadow of its former self. There are a few bright spots of course, like Planet Earth, Mythbusters, and Bill Nye, but for the most part, anything on Science Channel or Animal Planet is garbage.

I just finished watching Carl Sagan's Cosmos for the first time and was blown away.

If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you  must first invent the Universe.

 The paper is open-access and available over at PNAS:

 The researchers found that when they deactivated the macrophages, the salamanders healed in the same way other animals do: scabs and scars, but no new limbs

Thus, by process of elimination, they've found that macrophages are key to regeneration. It will be even trickier to find out why.
