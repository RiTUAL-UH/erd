 That I won the birth lottery by being born in the US.

The trick with winning the lottery is to use it wisely and not piss it away.

EDIT: [A world map of the measles outbreaks in 2013](http://www.measlesrubellainitiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/mmr_outbreaks_cropped-640x360.png)

Outbreaks are NOT in Central and South America.  




 Yes: "The World Health Organization reported this week that 113 countries, including China, Russia, Iran and Libya, have higher immunization rates than the United States for 1-year-olds."

"data from the World Health Organization shows that measles-vaccination rates in Mexico and Central America are higher than the U.S. rate of 92 percent"

 Compton Rate of Drinking Municipal Water: 93.80% 

Beverly Hills Rate of Buying Bottled Water (that is Actually Municipal Water): 78.33% 




 According to World Health Organization estimates, the U.S. has a measles vaccination rate of 92 percent, while **Mexico and Nicaragua have 99 percent vaccination rates** and Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador each have 93 percent vaccination rates. If anything, those countries should be concerned about Americans coming down to visit. 




 It was right to stop it then, it is right to stop it now. 




 Take shells 1 and 2 in your hand, and form them together like a clam shell. Make sure you can grasp with them.

Grab hold of the feces with the shells and pull them out. Continue until all large bits have been removed.

Use shell 3 to scrape (be gentle!) and remove anything you might have missed.

Wash (or flush) the shells, wash your bottom with warm water. 




  when professionals mix their personal advice in with their professional advice

This is their profession. XYZ Healing Arts practitioners offer a wide range of therapies for healing body and mind including: Acupuncture, Chiropractic, Homeopathy, Massage Therapy, Physical Therapy.

I went in for Chiropractic, Massage and Physical Therapy and they did a great job. Thus I just tolerated the homeopathic advice.  




 Since I made the above post, I read other posts and analysis.

The "Memorandum" is not a treaty - it is an agreement.

In the case of aggression, the remedy "if Ukraine should become a victim of *an act of aggression* or *an object of a threat of aggression in which nuclear weapons are used*" is to seek immediate United Nations Security Council action to provide assistance to Ukraine.

Morally I believe the U.S. made a commitment that it needs to keep. 




 If you Google "nightshade foods" you will find many suggestion that they can cause indigestion (and other intestinal issues) and joint pain. Since I was pretty shaken up in the car accident he recommended avoiding nightshades  - at least until my back recovered (which it did - I'm fine now). He did great physical therapy work, so I politely tolerated his homeopathy suggestions.  




  translation into different languages

If you want a real answer, I would suggest calling a librarian. They are amazing with topics like this, and they generally love the chance to answer questions like this.  




 Nightshade also includes eggplant and tobacco. I had a physical therapist (after an auto accident) tell me to avoid all nightshades. F*** that - I love them all way too much. 




 I don't know, but I'm guessing there are many translations.

You can get free e-book versions since it's in the public domain. 




 The "Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances" is a diplomatic memorandum signed in December 1994 by Ukraine, Russia, the United States, and the United Kingdom under which signatories made promises to each other as part of the denuclearization of former Soviet republics after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Ukraine promised to remove all nuclear weapons, and kept this promise.

In return, Russia and the Western signatory countries essentially consecrated the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine as an independent state. In the "Budapest Memorandum," Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States promised that none of them would ever threaten or use force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine. They also pledged that none of them would ever use economic coercion to subordinate Ukraine to their own interest. They also pledged to protect Ukraine if its security was threatened.  




 Meat with nightshade - a Shakespearean pizza  




 When post-Cold War Ukraine gained independence, it held the worlds third-largest stockpile of nuclear weapons. Rather than use nukes for protection, Ukraine sought and received assurances from the international community that its borders would be respected if it gave up its nuclear weapons. In 1994, the U.S., United Kingdom and Russia signed the Budapest Memorandum, in which **all sides pledged to respect Ukraines territorial integrity, refrain from using military force or economic pressure to limit Ukrainian sovereignty and provide assistance to Ukraine if it became the victim of aggression from another nation**.

Obviously, Russia has broken its part of that agreement. Now the question is whether the US will break theirs.

**If the U.S. breaks their word, they should consider the devastating impact on American counter proliferation efforts around the world**. How could any nation ever trust U.S. security assurances if they see, in the carnage and destruction in Ukraine, **the deadly folly of trading nuclear weapons for American guarantees**?

 I get the "strong compulsion" of nail biting, and how difficult it can be to stop the habit.

However - mine is very controlled, never in public, and only when the corner skin is built up (slightly calloused) so I'm basically trimming it. It's clearly "an irrational love".

 I love biting the skin at my [distal nail folds](http://www.healthhype.com/wp-content/uploads/nail_parts_top.jpg).

 I only know what I have [read recently, such as](http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/02/03/national/politics-diplomacy/constitutional-change-necessary-protect-japanese-citizens-abe/#.VNL6jUfF8SM):

After being unable to save two hostages held by Middle Eastern extremists, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said constitutional change will be needed to protect the lives and assets of Japanese citizens.

Abe has said at times that with the current interpretation of Article 9, which forbids both the use of force to settle international disputes and the maintenance of regular armed forces, it is difficult to protect Japanese citizens in a changing security environment.

The Liberal Democratic Party has already presented a draft amendment to Article 9, and amending it is to carry out our duty of protecting the lives and assets of Japanese citizens, Abe told the Upper House Budget Committee on Tuesday.

 Yet - they are considering changing their constitution so they can use their military for offense, not just homeland defense.  




 The king who advances without coveting fame and retreats without fearing disgrace, whose only thought is to protect his country and do good service for his sovereign, is the jewel of the kingdom.

 Guy Code - as a California resident, this is why I will never vote for [Gavin Newsom](http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/AIDE-QUITS-AS-NEWSOM-S-AFFAIR-WITH-HIS-WIFE-IS-2652745.php) 




 I love Zenni - I just ordered two pairs from them - one for daily use (with magnetic "clip on" sunglasses made to fit the frame), and a spare pair to leave in the car in case I lose/break the main pair. 




 Pupillary Distance (PD) is often INTENTIONALLY left off the prescription by the doc to try to force you to buy the glasses from them. 

Zenni has instructions on their website that tells you how to measure your PD (it's best done with help from a friend).

PS - I love Zenni. They even have models with magnetic "clip on" sunglasses. If you order these I recommend getting an extra/backup "clip on" if you plan to use it frequently.  




 Many have asked - what does this accomplish? 

If nothing else, **two ISIS bargaining chips have been removed  from the table**. (I would propose that the other chips should also be cashed in as soon as "judicially" possible.)

These two terrorist murderers were already sentenced to death, and ISIS forced the issue - - so death to ISIS terrorists it is. 




 Sajida al-Rishawi was already on death row. She was sentenced to death by hanging by a Jordanian military court on 21 September 2006.

Al-Karbouly was sent to death row in 2008 for plotting terror attacks on Jordanians in Iraq. 

Their just sentences have now been carried out. 




 I found one answer: Al-Karbouly was sent to death row in 2008 for plotting terror attacks on Jordanians in Iraq.His sentence has now been carried out - he was hanged Wednesday morning. . 












































 I tracked the karma points and votes of a front-page post (not mine) for a couple hours and Reddit reduced the scores twice. Is this typical? And why is this done? [Heres a chart of the points.](http://i.imgur.com/EwvmKzs.jpg) 



























































 As many as 2,000 people have been killed in Islamist extremist group Boko Haram's deadliest massacre yet in Nigeria. Most victims were children, women and elderly people who could not run fast enough when insurgents drove into the town of Baga, firing rocket-propelled grenades and assault rifles on town residents. 



















 From the AP Stylebook: "Lowercase **sun** and **moon**, but capitalize them if their Greek or Latin names are used: **Helios**, **Luna**."

But why? That does not make any sense to me.

**Edit**: Unless I missed it, no one has any answer as to "**WHY**" moon and sun are generally not capitalized by:

AP Stylebook, Garners Modern American Usage, Merriam-Websters Dictionary of English Usage, the NY Times, and many other literary sources (however scientific sources do tend to capitalize). **The "*WHY*" of the preference not to capitalize is still a mystery**.  





































































 At 40 it finally dawned on me that between haircuts it's up to me to shave my neck to keep it looking neat. DUH! 









 A top EU court ruled Google must amend some search results at the request of ordinary people as a "**right to be forgotten**", saying links to "irrelevant" and outdated data should be **erased on request**.

- In 2012, the European Commission published plans for a "right to be forgotten" law, allowing people to request that data about themselves to be deleted

- Online service providers would have to comply unless they had "legitimate" reason to do otherwise

- The plans are part of a wide-ranging overhaul of the commission's 1995 Data Protection Directive

While this does not apply outside the EU  what would *any* of you want erased? 



















 After what I've just seen on Reddit, I have to ask. Do you care about others? How are you demonstrating that you care?
