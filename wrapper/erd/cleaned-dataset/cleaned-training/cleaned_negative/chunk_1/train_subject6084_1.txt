 Yes, be careful. Remember when reddit successfully identified 10 of the 2 Boston bombers? 









 I'm not lovin' it. 









 I see a Dos Equis commercial here. 




 I will pop right in with this submission to show how hard that is. 50,000 words ~~would be~~ is so tough to do! 




 That's right. OP should from now on proof his words prior to posting. 




 It's a 50,000 *word* book. 









 Where's the red line for this kind of stuff? 




 Actually, a good number of those Athenians were of the other persuasion, I hear. 




 From the article, TIL also that "toad" was a common nickname given to prostitutes and courtesans at the time. 
























 This is in North America, btw.

 Apparently the model for Chloe wasn't so happy in Paris."She, after throwing a party for friends, boiled a soup of poisonous matches, drank the concoction and died." The reason for her suicide is thought to be unrequited love. 

RIP Chloe. 




 Disgraceful yes, but I can report that the painting is doing just fine.  


































 Not me for sure, I may have assumed that people knew that the internet existed prior the the world wide web, and had its own stuff like chat, usenet, and muds/mushs. Sorry, a bad assumption. 









 Not sure if serious... 









 Sorry! Time heals all wounds. :) 




 Reddit... has anyone ever beaten the game, all of it? Just curious.
 














 I wish this wasn't buried. Well said, pacman. 




 I recommend [this article](http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/features/fearless-matriarch-of-resistance/story-e6frg6z6-1226111207166). VERY late in life (age 88 by my reckoning) she said she wanted to die in London and moved to an expensive hotel in Piccadilly. She ran out of money, though, but the hotel didn't want to kick her out. Prince Charles started footing the bill. She had her own stool at the hotel bar, where during her nineties she would have at least 6 gin and tonics a day. Good for her, I say. She died in 2011 at age 98. 




 And I don't wanna talk to a scientist.  














 I know someone who tried to eat a blackberry once. It had to be surgically removed and its battery had gone dead. 














 Ghosts 'n Goblins 









 Not this by any chance?

 Wow, that was quick! Glad to share your link. I'm very interested in what they cooked up in antiquity. 




 There's something very very strange in these woods, Cooper.

Oh, ewoks.

 Oh Perth. 









 They should call it the Colosseam. 









 I'm very curious as to why cycling isn't included as a most common mode of transport category. 



















 I've got a gut feeling that this field is just in its infancy, especially with the decreasing cost and increasing usefulness of metagenomic studies of the microbial flora within animals. 




 Apparently he wants to build the first one between San Francisco and LA. The trip would take 30 minutes. 




 Here is the original press release from the Edmonton Police:

 One of the most underrated games of the last couple of years, was Sleeping Dogs. 




 The original link contains this sentence:

"In a joint sale for US$40 million, Abbott sold their rights to Desoxyn and Tranxene to Ovation Pharma."

"Ovation Pharma" links to a page to their website and from there directly to the link I just posted, which shows undeniably that methamphetamine is sold by that company. Unless you think we need to be held hands around the internet, don't insult our intelligence.

 This is a real tragedy. I hope we can find some way of preserving magnetic tapes. There must be so much out there to preserve but the high throughput means of doing so escapes me. 









 What's the working language or languages there? 




 And here's an amazing video of a very brief encounter with these people...
