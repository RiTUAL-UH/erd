 I have update my original post. After researching a little bit further, chromebook is definitely the best option where cost is an issue. 




 *Much giggles ensue after Jen leaves the room in a daze* 




 Would a chromebook be able to utilize the program Scrivener. Its the program I use the most when I'm setting up projects. I know it works on windows and Macs but I haven't looked into chromebooks to know if it would also work on those 




 Before I went back on the mood stabilizers, I wasn't quite so tired all the time. Now adding im having to take birth control after a surgery, its zapped what little extra energy I had to do anything.Im not exactly depressed, at least not all of the time. Mostly just mood-swinging from my body trying to get used to the new hormones being forced on it. Knowing where the mood swings are coming from doesn't always help though.

Has anyone had luck with vitamins for helping to mellow you out? Or any kind of natural supplement? Caffine makes me too jittery to really be an option 




 This seems to happen to me too. If Ive been stressed and anxious all day, I day dream about getting home just so I can go to bed 









 EDIT UPDATE : I believe I have decided to go with a Chromebook after reading an article a guy had wrote who also loved loves the Scrivener program. I will still definitely be emailing the Scrivener team to check into making an app that would work with Chromebook but I will research utilizing Google Docs for now.

If anyone else is having the same issue, here is the article that changed my mind:

Original Post:
I don't have the money yet but I want to plan out what some of my best options are . Looking for my most portable option for writing. I will need the internet for research as well.

**LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE**

 

* Country of purchase:
United States of America
 

* Budget range:
Under $300  *hopefully*
 

* Purpose (netbook, ultraportable, mainstream, gaming, desktop replacement, etc.)

I need it to be as ultraportable as possible. I want to be able to take it everywhere. I am in desperate need of a way to write on the go. I type fast and prefer it to writing by hand.
 

* Screen size preference:
Around 14" or less, I want a small size for portability
 

* OS preference (Windows/ Mac/ Linux):

 I prefer windows. Have not had a lot of experience with Mac systems

* Gaming requirements (example games and desired fps/settings):

 This laptop won't be for gaming. Ill just need to be able to do research on the internet.

* Performance requirements (video, CAD, etc.):

 I would like a fairly good wireless card installed. I do a lot of research on web in  lot of different areas. Right now all of it is done from my phone.

* Method of computer support (office supplier, college bookstore, self support):

 Google. Im fairly good with computers. Just looking for suggestions here. Laptops are not my specialty

* Brand preferences and reasons (already owned accessories, familiarity, business

compatibility):

 Open to suggestions.

* Any particular style that you like (examples are great):

 Just looking for something portable

* Which of the following qualities would you prefer? (Choose one, the other, or balanced)

 

* Long battery life -vs- Low weight:

 Low weight

* Build quality -vs- Low price:

 Maybe a little in between? I dont want it to break immediately

* Low noise/heat -vs- High performance:

 Low noise would be nice

**Would you pay a premium for something that has:**

 There aren't really any extra features I want

* High resolution screen:

 Doesn't matter

* A great keyboard:

 The keyboard is pretty important. It will be used quite a bit

* A great touchpad/mouse buttons:

 I usually plug in a mouse. I've never liked touchpads

* Great audio:

 Doesn't matter

**List any features that are critical:** (e.g. Optical drive, USB 3.0, SD card slot, ethernet port, HDMI port, bluetooth, VGA port, removable battery, glossy sjcreen, matte screen, etc.)

A screen that doesn't glare easy would be nice but not if it hikes the price too much. I need a few usb ports for a mouse and flashdrives. 




 I sold my 3DS to help with rent a little over a month ago and then Fantasy Life came out and I realized I missed Animal Crossing too so I scrounged to buy for a 2ds :/ and lost all my progress on my games. You'll end up wanting it back, trust me. 




 Perhaps they will consider bringing the abrasiveness back to some of the characters in another installment then. Either way, it makes no difference to me, the thing I like most about the game is collecting items and decorating and interacting online with people. I rarely have the music turned up 




 I remember my nephew complain about how long Resetti's rant was going on. I can understand why this happened. It is after all, supposed to be more geared toward children.
