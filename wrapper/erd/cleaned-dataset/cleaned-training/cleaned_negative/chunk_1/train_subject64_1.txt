 In reality, Obama tried desperately to extend America's presence in Iraq.  Fortunately for them and us, the Iraqis politely declined. 




 The first neocon? 




 Meanwhile, at least 18 police officers and civilians were killed in attacks in Afghanistan on Tuesday in a spate of violence that coincided with the start of the traditional fighting season there. 




 John Kerry, [wind surfer](http://obamapacman.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/John-Kerry-Wind-Surfing-539w.jpg) 




 Yes 




 Great comment.  Thanks. 




 All they care about, in the end, is the war itself -- or rather, war itself. Wherever they find incipient conflict, they are eager to exacerbate it, sustain it -- and feed upon it...Almost invariably, the policies adopted by the imperial managers (of both parties) make the conflicts worse, fomenting extremist resistance and ever-more violent repression: a deadly cycle that benefits no one -- except the "masters of war."

 Here's the survey where you can do just that: http://www.surveybuilder.com/s/IabMHlf1oAA 




 That's claimed by one of the villagers in the video report. 




 Me too.  Now I just get an onslaught of downvotes. 




 Do you think they'll endorse Ron Paul now? 




 He has, however, taken comfort in their movement toward his point of view on the war in Afghanistan. Mr. Gingrich has recently suggested pulling out of Afghanistan, and Mr. Santorum has said one option would be withdrawing faster than the Obama administrations 2014 timeline.

They know what the politics of it is, Mr. Paul says. **Thats what disgusts me. Why dont they take a stand and save some lives?** 




 Running for president demands enormous focus and energy. But it also requires level-headedness and personal maturity. Voters may be angry, but they prefer their presidents to be calm and professional.On this front, Santorum falls short and risks leaving a bad taste in voters mouths. If he cant pull it together and clean up his language, hes better off getting out sooner rather than later.  




 This is where I come to do fucked-up things, Givens said. So I dont do them at home. 




 The time has come to challenge the military at the level of its reason for being. The time has come to add up its suicides, its war crimes and the rest of its horrific legacy. How long can it survive and honest accounting? 




 "We are optimistic that a similar resolution can be found soon regarding the gradual transfer of the lead for **night raids** to Afghan forces. Already, Afghans increasingly lead these operations. **The success rate is overwhelming, and in most cases no shots are fired."** 




 "I keep hearing the president [Obama] say that he's responsible for keeping America from going into a Great Depression," Romney said. "No, no, no. That was President George W. Bush and [then Treasury Secretary] Hank Paulson that stepped in and kept that from happening." 




 The sad fact is that Bradley Manning is more likely to face the death penalty than Robert Bales. 




 "The Americans told the villagers, 'A bomb exploded on our vehicle. ... We will get revenge for this incident by killing at least 20 of your people,'" Rasool said. "These are the reasons why we say they took their revenge by killing women and children in the villages."

Mohammad said a U.S. soldier, speaking through a translator, then said: "I know you are all involved and you support the insurgents. So now, you will pay for it  you and your children will pay for this.'" 




 This campaign has been long, the general acknowledged. It has been difficult, and it has been costly. There have have been setbacks, to be sure. Were experiencing them now and there will be more setbacks ahead.

But, he said, I am confident that we will prevail in this endeavor.
 




 Staff Sergeant Bales and any other US soldier involved in the killing spree in Kandahar must be held accountable for his crimes. That being said, the far greater criminals are those in the Bush and Obama administrations who sent them to kill and die in wars based on lies. 




 Another reason for Pauls weakness is his anti-interventionist foreign-policy views. The one thing that has hurt him some has been his position relative to Iran, former Nevada governor Bob List tells National Review Online. I think thats been a big factor in why he hasnt done better out here. 




 Bales, if he committed the actions which he is accused of perpetrating on March 11, is a war criminal who deserves trial and punishment. But the more important war criminals are those in the White House, the Pentagon, the CIA and throughout the US political establishment who are responsible for more than ten years of war in Afghanistan, and who are plotting new wars in Syria, Iran and elsewhere. 




 I kind of sympathize for him, being gone, being sent over there four times, said Beau Britt, who lives across the street. I can understand hes probably quite wracked mentally, so I just hope that things are justified in court. I hope it goes OK. 




 Check out the photo they used. 




  The villages are one and a half kilometre from the American military base. We are convinced that one soldier cannot kill so many people in two villages within one hour at the same time, and the 16 civilians, most of them children and women, have been killed by the two groups. 




 In another event that calls into serious question the Pentagons unfailingly positive view of US progress in Afghanistan, the US military was compelled to acknowledge that it had significantly underestimated the seriousness of an incident that took place Wednesday, when a man drove a truck onto the runway at the Camp Bastion airport in Helmand, just as the plane bringing Defense Secretary Panetta was arriving there.
 
**It has since emerged that the individual driving the truck, which had been stolen from an Afghan soldier, was an Afghan interpreter working for the US-led occupation**. He died on Thursday from severe burns suffered when he apparently tried to ignite the vehicle. **Pentagon officials admitted Thursday that the interpreter was trying to run down a group of US Marines assigned to meet the aircraft.**
 
The incident underscored both the lack of security in an area supposedly secured by the US surge, as well as the continuing proliferation of so-called green-on-blue violence, the term used by the US military to describe attacks against it by Afghan security forces that are supposedly its allies. 




 A lot of people in this area support the Taliban because they see women and children get killed, he said. 




 That's just not true. 




 The shooting echoed through the silent night, and was without a doubt heard by the U.S. soldiers at the camp, Mohammed said. 




 His real name is Randall Paul.  He was not named after Ayn Rand. 




 How does that relate to a story about a political rally?  Please explain. 




 I think you posted your comment to the wrong story. 




 "I asked the elders here, why no demonstrations, no outcry? They say they are silent because they want to deliberate their moves, they want to decide. And once they decide, there will be no army, no force that can stop them." 




 When the Americans first came, it was people like me who welcomed them, said Abdul Jabar, 28, a truck driver from Kandahar. Now they are killing our women and children. 




 "Rare" abuses, "decade of progress"? 




 Outrageous statements begin around 5:08 of the video. 




 There's something kinda scary about that headline. 




 "We have to reassess the entire region," Gingrich said. "We need to understand that our being in the middle of countries like Afghanistan is probably counterproductive." 




 American forces have been in and out of Mali for several years now, as they have been in other Sahel countries, primarily to help the small army -- the Mali Defense Force numbers 7,000 men and a few women -- develop a counter-terrorism capability, to the extent possible in cooperation with its neighbors. 




 These people are our allies. They want many of the same things we do. They have expanded the boundaries of what everyone thought was possible in Syria. They have earned our respect, and now they need our support to finish what they started. The Syrian people deserve to succeed, and shame on us if we fail to help them. 




 "We cant afford to wait much longer, and we certainly cant afford to wait through four more years of an Obama administration. By then it will be far too late. If the Iranians are permitted to get the bomb, the consequences will be as uncontrollable as they are horrendous." 




 Should we take bets on who wrote this editorial for Romney? 




 "Due process and judicial process are not one and the same, particularly when it comes to national security.  The Constitution guarantees due process, not judicial process," the attorney general said. 




 "**In this hour of danger, we simply cannot afford to wait until deadly plans are carried out, and we will not**," he said in remarks prepared for a speech at Northwestern University's law school in Chicago.

Sounds a little like George W. Bush or Condi Rice, don't ya think? 




 None of this is to say that an attack should be ruled out. 




 The workers and two Afghan officers rescued 216 books, including 48 Qurans, from being burned, Dad said. **They were shouting and pulling the books from the burn pit, preventing the U.S. troops from throwing the remaining four cartons of books into the fire**, he said. 




 Feel free to do so.  I will upvote you every time. 




 I have just returned from Israel, where I spent 10 days and had the opportunity to visit with people from the prime minister to street market vendors... 




 The Romney campaign, however, says this is different.
 
**Every state budget in the country is dependent on federal funding**, and every governor in the country makes requests for funding, but governors do not get to decide how Congress appropriates money, said Romney spokesman Andrea Saul.
 




 BTW, Ron Paul has [gained 2 points](http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/archive/election_2012_archive/february_2012/national_gop_romney_40_santorum_24_gingrich_16_paul_12) in the [last two weeks](http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/archive/election_2012_archive/february_2012/national_gop_santorum_39_romney_27_gingrich_15_paul_10). 




 The Army is offering a $10,000 reward for tips leading to the recovery of the stolen items, which the Army valued at $344,000. 




 He's still for killing Muslims, but at least he realizes that it's now a pointless exercise in Afghanistan. 




 And how has it affected supply? Not much. More than 22 years after the biggest cocaine bust in history, the biggest change along the front lines of the U.S. drug war may simply be the accents of the traffickers. 




 "People are not taking into account what can happen to those who are growing it. There are homes with mold and water damage in the hundreds of thousands and there are children in there too. 




 Napolitano also expressed confidence that notorious Mexican drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, who escaped from prison in 2001, would be recaptured eventually.  

"Let me just say, it took us ten years to find Osama Bin laden. We found him, **and you know what happened there..."** 




 FYI, the quote is from Bob Woodward's *The Commanders.* 




 A $500 million upgrade has begun to fill in the extra acreage. 




 Check out the pic of the pope. 




 According to three Afghan security officials familiar with the case, the main suspect was Abdul Saboor, who was said to have worked in the ministry for more than a year as a driver. The two American officers who were killed were shot in the head and the pistol used to kill them was **equipped with a silencer**, the officials said.

Afghan officials said that Mr. Saboor was at large, apparently **able to leave the ministry without complication after the shooting**. That suggested to some observers that he may have had help in the attack.

 Whether they had indifference or feelings from the past, there were no problems with the local population or with Montenegrin officers and soldiers, he said. From the minute weve landed here until today, the relationship building, the team building has been great. 




 If he was really concerned about the safety and welfare of the troops, it seems like it w/b easier just to bring them home. 




 "I was ready to shed my blood and kill them or be killed," Jamil told Reuters, sitting in a heavy winter jacket, a checked scarf tied tight around his neck. 




 "We Afghans don't want these Christians and infidels, they are the enemy of our soil, our honor and our Koran," said Haji Shirin, one of the protesters.

"I urge all Muslims to sacrifice themselves in order to pull out these troops from this soil."
 




 Sounds like a winning message to take into the 2012 election. /s 




 Saturdays caucuses in Hancock opened at 10 a.m. with prayer and the pledge of allegiance and featured speakers in support of Newt Gingrich, Ron Paul and Mitt Romney. **When the microphone was offered to a supporter of Rick Santorum, no one came forward.** 




 Begins at around 9:20 of the video. 




 Starts about 9:20 of the video. 




 Begins around 9:25 in the video. 




 Unlike a vast majority of those running for office, [Santorum] is totally OK with going there, penis-in-various-holes-wise. I suspect that it's his apparent comfort with explicitly raising the idea of sex, as much as his out-of-kilter views on it, that rankles all but the most extreme social conservatives. To go from the hypothetical legalization of homosexual marriage to bestiality, you have to have at least given passing thought to the physical act of gay sex.  




 I cant believe in 2012 the federal government is raiding Amish farmers at gunpoint all over a basic human right to eat natural food, said one of them, who asked not to be named but received weekly shipments of eggs, milk, honey and butter from Rainbow Acres, a farm near Lancaster, Pa. In Maryland, they force taxpayers to pay for abortions, but God forbid we want the same milk our grandparents drank. 




 Is this a trial balloon from the Rick Santorum campaign? 




 They've done such a good job in Iraq and Afghanistan that I don't see any reason why they couldn't handle the transition to solar energy. 




 The new concepts would leave a projected 12,000 Special Operations Forces deployed around the world; some on call for striking terrorist targets or rescuing hostages, and others deployed on training and liaison assignments and to gather information. 




 From the comments section: The analysis of Mr. Mallon is good, except in regards to his comments on Ron Paul's foreign policy. Endless war and the gold standard don't get along very well. There is no way that this country can ever return to fiscal solvency as long as we have the oversears empire. For 100 years the USA has tried to be the policeman of the world. The Federal Reserve and our endless over seas entanglements started with Woodrow Wilson. It is time to drive a stake through the heart of Wilsonianism. End the Fed. Bring the troops home. Concentrate on this country and let the world run itself. Wars always lead to high inflation and high taxes. Greenspan and Bernanke though that they could get us through these wars without either. Well we see how that turned out. 




 Value Added Tax 




 Will sounds like RP: "Do Republicans think it is premature to withdraw as many as 7,000 troops from Europe two decades after the Soviet Unions death? About 73,000 will remain, most of them in prosperous, pacific, largely unarmed and utterly unthreatened Germany. Why do so many remain?" 




 The Democratic Party owes a sincere apology to George Bush, Dick Cheney and company for enthusiastically embracing many of the very Terrorism policies which caused them to hurl such vehement invective at the GOP for all those years. 




 Other countries have developed drone technology, and if they follow U.S. precedent, they could start targeting their own enemies across any border they like, including our own. 




 Too bad he didn't do that with Libya, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Yemen, Somalia and the Philippines. 




 Additionally, the office is working to arm the drone with the Advance Precision Kill Weapon System... 




 The former Communist political and military commander for the whole of southern Afghanistan, General Nur al-Haq Ulumi, told me that the Communist Party in the 1980s had 200,000 members as core supporters. **I doubt if there are more than 40 people really loyal to Karzai**, he added. He does not even have the full support of his own cabinet. 




 Additionally, the office is working to arm the drone with the Advance **Precision Kill Weapon System**, a capability requested by 5th Fleet and U.S. Central Command. Smith said the drones aboard Simpson will not be armed during the deployment. 




 'Obama's War' was initially used by PBS, not me.  These civilian deaths are the result of [Obama's Afghan surge beginning in 2009](http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/12/01/politics/main5846260.shtml).  Had he ended the war rather than escalated it, these civilians would be alive and well. 




 What a shock... 




 The Ron Paul people, the Tea Party and the conservative movement are to Mitt Romney and the country-club wing of the Republican establishment what laid-off workers were to Mitt Romney and Bain Capital. You are property, to be used when you can be helpful, to be humored and condescended to when you become nervous, to be discarded when you are no longer useful, and to be crushed by big money if you show integrity to conviction policies which they deplore behind your backs. 




 USA! USA! USA? 




 Meanwhile...[Rick Santorum spoke to a group of about 300 people at the Lone Tree Golf Club](http://www.850koa.com/cc-common/news/sections/newsarticle.html?feed=124975 article=9675858). 




 Earlier in the day the Congressman spoke to a crowd of 1,100 at C-S-U in Fort Collins.  The crowd in Denver appeared to be just as big. 




 I'm just using common sense based upon what the "all options are on the table" phrase has meant in the past. 




 That's what that phrase means.  Obama is threatening to drop nuclear bombs on Iran to prevent them from acquiring a nuclear weapon which they're not developing. 




 FYI: "All options are on the table" = I'm willing to drop nuclear bombs on civilians to achieve my political objectives. 




 And he said he did not understand how U.S. President Barack Obama is able to characterize Iraq as a free, stable and democratic country.
 
"What sort of Iraq we are talking about?" he asked. "How the Americans will feel proud? How the American administration is going to justify to the taxpayer the billion of dollars that has been spent and at the end of the day the American saying, 'Sorry, we have no leverage even to put things in order in Iraq'?"
 




 Note the correction at the bottom of the article:

He opposes the Stop Online Piracy Act, not the Stop Online Privacy Act. 




 Check out the war/troops category. 




 "It's not about Ron Paul," McGrady says. "We don't think Ron Paul is infallible. It's the message. He's the only guy saying anything that anyone believes." 




 Only Ron Paul has confidence that capitalism will prevail. That should tell you all you need to know about the people running for president in the Republican Party these days. 




 Then you're not a libertarian. 




 Great point. 




 What a fucking outrage. 




 It's been confirmed that the six dead were U.S. Marines. 




 Newt wants to be our ages Disraeli; he is in fact its Eddie Haskell. 




 We're continuing to see **unacceptable levels of violence** inside that country, and so we will continue to consult very closely with Jordan to create the kind of international pressure and environment that encourages the current Syrian regime to step aside, Obama stated.

This from a guy that murders his fellow citizens. 




 I voted for Rick Perry. 




 See nixons-dog's comment below. 




 You and I may not agree with them  I do, mostly, **up to the part about allowing Iran to bomb Israel**

I wouldn't expect anything less from a writer for this rag.  How pathetic. 




 I agree. 




 Read this [article by Arthur Silber](http://powerofnarrative.blogspot.com/2012/01/varieties-of-pissing.html). He cuts to the core of the argument that the corpse pissing is trivial compared to the greater war crime being perpetrated by the American empire. 




 For the rest of us in the liberal-minded citizenry, we would do well to recall that wars are initiated and sustained by leaders and governments, and by the powerful interests and passions that back them.
 
To vent frustration for this situation by easy condemnation of some young enlisted marines is a bit like pissing on corpses.
 




 Great point. 




 A report on CNN contradicts the description of RP's house as a mansion: http://cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/politics/2012/01/13/jk-candidates-homes-kate-bolduan.cnn.html 




 Another great reason to vote for Ron Paul. 




 In a statement, **Romney called Bolton a staunch defender of US interests and values**, and said he would be consulting with him on foreign policy. Johns wisdom, clarity, and courage are qualities that should typify our foreign policy, Romney said. 




 Here's the full video: http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=ddb_1326259280 




 Didn't see that.  Was x-posting from Lew Rockwell. 




 Great video attached to story. 




 Video at bottom of piece is worth watching. 




 Cognitive **dissonance** 




 Today, Guantanamo holds 171 prisoners and it's an odd mix. Thirty-six await trial on war crimes charges, including the alleged mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks. There are 46 in indefinite detention as men the U.S. considers dangerous **but who cannot be charged for lack of evidence** or other reasons. 




 Yes, Obama the man who started a war in Libya without seeking approval from Congress has no ability to close a prison located at a U.S. military base. 




 Mr. Santorum then backed a move to have the state legislature provide the money. The outcome was that a provision tucked in a innocuous-sounding housekeeping bill **committed the state to lend the money in effect to the owners of the two teams, with an informal understanding it would not be paid back.** It wasnt and still hasnt been... 




 But I thought The Surge worked, right? 




 Sponsored by The Emergency Committee For Israel 




 Here single also went from [#32 to #20](http://www.billboard.com/#/charts/hot-100?begin=11 order=position). 




 Starts at about 27:21 of the video. 




 According to Santorum, the Israelis have a right to build settlements in the West Bank because the West Bank is ground "gained during war" following "an aggressive attack." 




 Why do you think your rivals label you as a fringe candidate?

They are incapable of shifting their opinions. They have been locked into economic planning. They have been locked into not worrying about privacy of individuals. Theyve been locked into foreign entanglements, and they cant really psychologically back away. 




 Paul was called back for something of an encore. 




 Why isn't this labeled as an opinion piece?

Paul is just unelectable. A Paul win could make the GOP Iowa electorate seem so out of step with the rest of the nation that is would raise the question of their future role in choosing presidential nominees. 




 This is where Richard Cohen is coming from:

"The intervention in Libya, a NATO operation but an American enterprise, succeeded. So did the ones in Bosnia and Kosovo. The Libyan bombings will not bring democracy to that country, but they knocked out Moammar Gaddafi, and that aint a bad days work." 




 **Hes very lenient on legalizing marijuana and drugs,** Al TeSlaa, a soybean, corn and cattle farmer from the small northwestern town of Rock Rapids, said when asked about Paul. **I dont know what hes thinking and why people are falling for that; if its the young people that are falling for that, that are thinking, Oh, man, legalizing marijuana and all drugs or whatever; oh man, were going to have a nice world. ** 




 More than 60 people crowded into the shop's new Main Street location to hear Santorum speak. 




 Note the poll in the right column:  Who will win the Iowa Republican caucus?  




 Watched it.  Thanks for the recommendation. 




 New York Rep. Jack Kemp, also campaigning in South Carolina, said the United States should not rule out military force in removing Noriega because he "represents a threat to the Panama Canal." 




 I guess it's his [Muskie moment](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm5bxCoTEkc feature=related). 




 Well, then I guess the matter's closed. 




 How do they determine if someone is a "sympathizer?" 




 Todays Republican Party is dominated by Christian conservatives (44 percent of participants in the 2008 primaries identified themselves as evangelicals) and neoconservatives, who are united in their commitment to an unwavering alliance between the United States and Israel, confrontation with Iran, and a significant American presence in the Middle East. Pauls warnings about blowback directly threaten this consensus. 




 Obama won the Iowa caucuses. 




 Ron Paul is the perfect candidate for the bigots in this country. He is not like the racists who paraded in white sheets or the David Dukes who stated their allegiance to the ideas of Hitler. 




 For those who think we can sit around using drugs legally singing kumbaya, have a weak national defense throwing Israel under the bus and no government to protect its citizens Ron Paul is their candidate. 




 Never mind Paul being the favored candidate of the lunatic fringe (see white supremacists, anti-Semites, truthers, etc.). 




 **The Paul candidacy is of course doomed.** But the Paul vote won't die. This vote has been building in the depths of the American political ocean since the spending spree of the second Bush term.  




 Here is the money quote from Chuck Todd: Look, this is a game of where does Mitt Romey finish and where does Newt Gingrich, or maybe even an upset, a Rick Perry finish.  If any of those guys finish above Mitt Romney that are not named Ron Paul, that person will be, the quote, the winner out of here regardless of whether Ron Paul is the actual winner.

I hope somebody does a video w/ all of these statements about the caucuses essentially being meaningless if RP wins.  That could be very inspirational on the day before the voting. 




 Todd also states that RP has no appeal to economic conservatives. 




 RP comments begin at about 5:24. 




 On Tuesday, a delivery van carrying the document was blocked by about 200 protesters, forcing the vehicle to turn back. 




 Not according to [Breitbart](http://www.breitbart.tv/paul-hamas-was-started-by-israel/). 




 I guess to be a "decent American" I have to support torture, indefinite detention and aggressive wars.  Wow. 




 Does she even know who Ron Paul is? 




 Even his own supporters don't view him as having the best chance to beat Barack Obama.

Huh? I believe most RP supporters think he's the only one who can beat Obama. 




 RP's response: If they want to endorse me, theyre endorsing what I do or say  it has nothing to do with endorsing what they say, said Mr. Paul, who is now running strong in Iowa for the Republican nomination. 




 I hate to post this crap, but it's out there and everyone should be aware of it. 




 Yes. 




 Yes, b/c he could end it. 




 It's still creepy. 




 I just think it's kinda creepy to have the U.S. military tracking Santa. 




 [More Details](http://tdn.com/news/local/u-s-army-specialist-from-longview-killed-in-afghanistan/article_d9c6a87c-2d02-11e1-aa42-001871e3ce6c.html): A female Mark Morris High School graduate was shot and killed Wednesday in a guard tower in Afghanistan, according to the soldier's stepmother. U.S. Army Specialist Mikayla Anne Bragg is Cowlitz County's first casualty in a combat zone since the Vietnam War, according to Daily News archives. 




 There are no attempts at pandering to Iowa, no slaps at his GOP rivals or even President Obama. The lack of partisanship in Pauls speeches might help explain the broad and diverse coalition hes cobbling together here. 




 Watch the video. 




 Here are the stories from The Weekly Standard and HotAir:

Weekly Standard: http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/ron-paul-runs-defense-falls-apart_614657.html

HotAir:  http://hotair.com/archives/2011/12/22/paul-in-1995-say-have-you-read-my-newsletters/

In my view, the more people that watch the video the better.  My guess is that it will create more RP voters, not lose them. 




 How about this sentence from the article: "There is, of course, the matter of his past racism. And that raises the possibility that his opposition to social spending is motivated by racial resentment." 




 What exactly do Republicans stand for? Aggressive war, torture, Gitmo, big govt statism?  Why wouldn't Ron Paul, or any other rational person, be against that? 




 RP's Response: I dont have any specific response  People have challenged me on that all along and they should because it challenges people. I think the conventional wisdom of Washington is quite different than the conventional wisdom of the people, Paul said. I happen to think thats one of the reasons that Im rising in the polls, because the American people are tired of the wars and theyre tired of spending that money, so I think its a big positive political issue. 




 and national Republicans wouldn't think he represents the will of voters."

So if he gets the most votes, that wouldn't represent the "will of the voters?" 




 Drones are joysticked, not flown. 




 Disclosure foes argue that the need for secrecy is unquestioned in conventional wars. In World War II, they were killing people all over the place, with lots and lots of mis-hits, one official said. The civil liberties community wasnt saying we want to see targeting lists of what youre hitting. **George Washington did not turn over his targeting list of the British**. 




 There will be no Arab-style revolution. You can see that Kazakhstan is calm, he told Reuters by telephone. Kazakhstans entire multi-national population supports the head of state.  




 Yes, because as you know, I love socialism. 




 And those who collaborated with the Americans are also at risk of being targeted by the remnants of the Sunni al-Qaeda fighters, who have been systematically pursuing those who turned against them. Now that he has been stripped of the security that came with his position, Dulaimi said, I might be assassinated by terrorists at any time. He added, Who is going to protect me? 




 Obama is a warmonger.  Ron Paul is for peace.  How is Ron Paul "Obama on steroids?" 




 You cant make nice with the mullahs. They hate us, they hate everything about America. **They hate our lifestyle, they hate our faith.** They dislike us to the point that they would use a nuclear device first to wipe Israel off the face of the earth and **they consider Israel to be the little Satan, they consider us to be the big Satan.** 




 "Last night's debate likely halted his rise," said Tim Albrecht, communications director for Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad. "It remains to be seen if he'll slip, however, as his supporters remain the most stable and steadfast in terms of their support of Ron Paul."

I think this is wishful thinking on the GOP establishment's part. 




 So we have Mark Levin, Bill Bennett, Limbaugh, Hannity, Jeffrey Lord, Max Boot, Giuliani, Bill O'Reilly, Dick Morris, Nat'l Review, Commentary, Washington Examiner, and now Kimbery Strassel of the WSJ all launching similar attacks on RP w/in a 24-hour period.  How could this not be a coordinated attack? 




 Sadjadpour said some White House officials question whether **Iran is trying to provoke an Israeli strike** in order to rally support at home and abroad. 




 FDR's the dude who put [Mr. Sulu in a concentration camp](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUrpIFp7EMA), right? 




 What's a money ball? 




 According to Mr. Frum, apparently Ron Paul is pro-slavery:

Theres much to dislike about Ron Pauls politics, and I dislike every bit of it. (Its maybe remote from current concerns, but at a minimum, **I have no patience for a professed libertarian who openly prefers the slaveholding cause in the U.S. Civil War.**) 




 **Iraqi civilians were being killed all the time.** Maj. Gen. Steve Johnson, the commander of American forces in Anbar, in his own testimony, described it as **a cost of doing business.** 




 I think a proper follow-up question from Greta might be: Why do you think Ron Paul couldn't beat Obama? 




 There's another new NH poll that totally contradicts this poll: http://americanresearchgroup.com/pres2012/primary/rep/nh/ 




 The war that began with the bang of shock and awe ended with the whimper of withdrawal with few of the issues solved. Many Americans are saying "good", while most Iraqis are saying good riddance. 




 This has to be a coordinated attack.  Hannity plays the racist newsletter card and then Bennett follows up with the 9/11 conspiracy lie used by Nat'l Review yesterday. 




 "We haven't gained anything from the country. They destroyed the country and now they are leaving." 




 [We're still there](http://www.stripes.com/news/u-s-pursuing-legal-protections-for-contractors-still-in-iraq-1.163465), so your point is he lied? 




 This piece is actually pretty good w/ the exception of Max Boot and one of the callers calling RP a racist. 




 At a defense contracting company here this morning, Mr. Ginrich was asked by reporters about the events. **I have a very consistent record of opposing tax increases, and I dont think that people should break their word to raise taxes**, he said 




 No, not really. 




 Gingrich spoke at a crowded town hall at Insight Technologies, **a weapons maker** in Londonderry. 




 [Here are some gems of wisdom from the author in a blog post](http://hnn.us/node/139495): "These voters believe not only that unbridled capitalism will fix the debt/ deficit crisis, create jobs, and protect American freedoms, it will also fix our schools and hospitals, too. They believe the government should "get out of the way," deregulate the marketplace, slash taxes and spending, and let independent market forces do their job." 




 Paul presents himself as a man of principle and as an intellectual devoted to liberty, and his legions of fans love him for it. **While his personal integrity is beyond reproach, his intellectual views on liberty are pretty amateur.** He writes books on liberty, but they are little more than trite panegyrics to the nature of freedom, which he defines simply as the absence of government. 




 Of course the obligatory:

Nobody thinks Paul is going to win the Republican nomination. His antiwar, anti-interventionist views on foreign policy put him well out of the Republican mainstream. Some of his libertarian views  on the legalization of drugs, for example  led him into embarrassing statements in an early debate. 




 In recent days, the Republican presidential hopefuls have gone out of their way to express support for Israel. **The one exception has been Ron Paul**, who says he would zero out all US foreign aid, including Israels. 




 I'm trying to stir up anti-war sentiment.  It doesn't have much to do w/ Obama per se. 




 I wasn't implying that Obama was the first to take part in illegal interventions.  That goes back to at least the War of 1812, if not before. 




 The escalations in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia and Uganda.
