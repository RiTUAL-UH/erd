 "At the end of the day", "hemmin' and hawin'", "low hanging fruit", "touch base", "reach out"....pretty much any common business phrase. 




 Right before I wrote this comment. Did-ya hear it? 




 Wireless Electricity 




 Anything in particular you want to be remembered for?  




 Apparently you haven't smelled it. 




 Why do you get up in the morning? What are you hoping to gain before your time is up? 




 SnapChat 




 Don't do it unless you have plenty of cash reserves.  




 You have to work with boring computer programmers all day. 









 Ever get stuck in a "locked conversation" where the other person is talking but never asks any questions and you can't get away easily? Annoying! 




 Have you ever tried that? 




 ..... 




 Office politics, useless conversation that goes nowhere 




 Go for Felix Douglas. Can't go wrong there. 




 Does a polar bear make a good pet? 









 SavedByTheBell and Farting 




 Having to interact with them in person 




 Turbolax :-) Just one teaspoon for fast, effective relief 




 Should you take a dump with the toilet lid down? 




 Try Google Chrome 




 What if I'm interested and want to watch, but still find myself dozing? 




 How so? 




 Is it wise to fart in an elevator full of top-level executives? 




 Does a walrus make a good pet? 




 Is the library a good place to practice yodeling? 




 LTS for BQI 




 Start a company. It's the #1 way millionaires are made. Specifically, a web-based business. 









 Going to work everyday 




 Should I look for OTC meds to help? 




 Trying to flatulate 100 times by the end of my vacation 




 Diet consists of peanut butter, chicken sandwich with guacamole, salad, and oatmeal. Should I be concerned? 




 Is it crazy to drop a cell phone in a port-a-john? 




 Ironically, Mark is the one who invested in Rapid Ramen. I think it was more about the entrepreneur's drive/determination. He seems to look out for the hard workers, since he was in the same situation (i.e. trying to get his companies off the ground). 




 I think 19 Entertainment basically "owns" anyone who appears on the show. Even if a contestant signs with another label, 19E has the right to "manage" and get a cut out of profits.

 What are your favorite quotes from the show?

I particularly liked "What, do you want to sing Kumbaya? This is business...get to it!" from the 10/4 episode. 




 Is it greedy for Fox to take a cut of American Idol record sales they helped generate? I don't think so. These shows make people famous/millionaires overnight. Not too much to ask  to take some profits back to pay bills.

I understand Cuban's point, though. Some entrepreneurs might not be in a position to give up additional equity, and the sharing clause deters them from being on the show. 




 Coming in unprepared. 




 Daymond is worse, in my opinion. He rarely invests and frequently talks down to entrepreneurs as if he's the king of everything. 




 More like 2.5 hours, according to Cuban. 




 Not necessarily. Viewers may like/buy the product, regardless of what the sharks say. 




 2% profit or 5% equity. Either way, being on the show increases sales sometimes 10-fold, so might be worth it. 














 You made yourself lose by picking him. 




 It's not the end of the world. 




 Work on a better hedging strategy, the rest will fall into place. 




 Do cows make chocolate milk? 




 Worrying won't do any good. Will you care a year from now? 




 The bird's the word 




 I agree. What was the thinking here? 




 You might be overthinking it 




 Is it dumb to fly a kite during a hurricane? 




 On second thought, Bryan Cooper might be better. 




 My vote - John Tarr, can't go wrong with him 




 Valid concern. Wendy's Spicy Chili can really impact performance after 3-4 bowls 




 Might want to try a hedging strategy to offset potential losses 




 I agree. What's being asked is superfluous
