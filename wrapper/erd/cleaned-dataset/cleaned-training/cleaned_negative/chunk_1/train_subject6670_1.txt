 I bet the drugs are gonna be in the ps1 that OP finds in the back compartment of that N64 




 OP is apparently a woman, man, liar, but most importantly, a faggot 




 OP is in a polygamous relationship with assorted bags of pasta? 









 The reveiws for that product are hilarious btw  




 TIL don't get a timber wolf

 I didn't realize I was still moving the whale around my screen until 15 minutes later 




 I wonder what the chances are of one of the photographers getting sucked into the jet engine if it was that close... 









 Can I ask how on earth you found that... Haha 




 Did the boner last all 30 minutes?? 




 Who won? 




 You could always get some UV Protecting arm sleeves off of Amazon. I started using them recently and no longer have this problem! 




 There was minimal brake fade, I applied the brakes for a few seconds at a time to give them time to cool off in between. I do have the basalt braking surface on my rims, I'm not sure if that plays a role in not overheating 




 The largest descent I've done was about 500 feet over 3 miles... got up to 43-44 mph at the bottom 




 I got mine from farsports. 38mm front and 50mm rear, 650 shipped and they came in at 1290 grams. I've put about 1300 miles on them and haven't had a single issue. Even braking is pretty good (assuming you have a decent set of brakes... I have ultegra 6700 on my bike)

They arrived in about 10 days via EMS and packaging was flawless. I was impressed 




 Yeah they are from China. I'm happy with them so far... we'll see if that changes 



















 Did he wet himself before or after he died? 




 Is the seagull going to be okay? 




 OP is clearly a Pokemon fan
