 BARK BARK POW! Agent Dog has shot me straight through the heart. I am in love. Also, possibly dying. 




 I want a Gun Dog Series. Might I suggest some titles?

Agent Gun Dog- A Hero's Path.
Agent Gun Dog- To Protect and Serve.
Agent Gun Dog- Sentinel Against The Unknown.
 




 It seems like Latin, but I get "I will cut you?" I see others translating it as "I will kill you" and that makes far more sense. Lets go with that. 

Succubus maybe? Bit of advice, never give a ghost permission to touch your naughties. 




 I don't think there's much I can do- I have work and responsibilities just like everyone else...I'm sure it's just some subconscious thing. I hope so. I've never actually thought much of it, until it started getting close to the date. Your idea of it marking an event is really intriguing.
