 Been doing this since I turned 21!   Little bit of Halo and some CoD with the friends then go out and make ass's of ourselves! 
 




 I do snowboard in the winter.  I love it!  Had the same board for some years now.   Rome Graft w/ Burton custom bindings.   It's been good to me. 




 I tried it and it didn't turn out to well.  I get the speed-wobbles bad on fast inclines.   I can't control my breaking. 




 I actually played poker since 10nth grade high school.  I did local matches around my last area and it was a blast!   You need that money to make money tho.   I'll have to check if there is any close casinos. 




 I just started mountain biking.    




 I have terrible shoulders, here is a few of my accidents that led me to the ER.

1. Thanksgiving playing Wii tennis with the gf  (dislocated shoulder)
2. Driving down the road and I sneeze   (dislocated shoulder)
3.  Climbing out of the lake using a ladder to get on the dock (dislocated shoulder)
4. Eating a girl out and she moves her leg to quick (dislocated shoulder)
5.  Reaching to the top cabinet at my apartment (dislocated shoulder)

There is a lot more and always explaining to the ER nurses always comes with laughs and tears (from me) 














 Thanks for the replies!  When we first moved in it was not bubbling, but after awhile bother apartments started bubbling in both spots.  I pointed it out to my landlord awhile ago on a mid term inspection.   I would fix it myself even since it would cost about $50.00 and my labor.   Which is better then $400.00.  I will call them again or the mangement team for complex.   

I just didn't know if there was any loop holes to this. 




 I live in an apartment complex.  It has 7 total apartments.  4 of them were redone including mine and a friends that lived next door.  The friend actually moved out last week and while we were moving a tv stand it clipped this linoleum flooring and tore it.   It's only in the entry way.  Anyway where it caught the flooring was because the flooring was actually bubbling up.  They barely put glue down it seems like.  Underneath is another linoleum flooring, but seems to be glued down a lot better.  It's just really beat up.  

The flooring in my apartment is also bubbling like it was in my friends apartment.  I contacted the landlord a couple times but no response.  

Am I screwed on the damage deposit?  I can upload pics for a better idea too.   
 




 ^^**PENIS!**

 




 I dare you to do it one more time 









 Or if you read [here] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Torch) the human torch dies in the comics and Spiderman joins.  So, maybe it could work?   









 It's like a mini golden retriever or lab.   




 I had no interest in watches.  I started reading the details and looking at the pictures.  I find it fascinating having a little running machine that does something that we find so simple, yet huge in our lives.  It's amazing.  Thank you for this! 




 It's not actually Tosh just a friend that looks like him 









 Just watching some Caturday cattoons.   









 they can't!  Didn't you look at the pic?  The dog pulled the parking brake lol 




 then proceeds to drown... 




 SSSsssssoon 




 Bet you played for 20 seconds and said "Man this glare fkn sucks" and went back inside. 




 That's an urban legend. 









 Way to easy, it's pretty dead on. 




 Aww, he looks like a Bert!

 Zoidberg's Grandma? 




 What Chris Rock be?  Or how about Sharon Stone? 




 Either way I still wished they were short movies.   




 Ohh look at the itty bitty goatsie.

 Most Fucking Weird 




 I was emotional, clicked on the picture, felt kinda happy, clicked on the comments, I'm sad again.  What a roller coaster of feelings that just happened!

 * What made you get into flying?
* How did you stumble on being a Redbull pilot?
* What did you do before flying for Redbull?
* What's your craziest story?
* Are you essentially sponsored by Redbull? 









 It's only 5 hours old!  How do we know this is the Bestof!  We need more time! 




 It sucks and looks crappy.  Is that what you wanted to hear?   




 Thanks! 




 His name is Flip.  Maybe it's a her, they never really disclose during the show.  The character was introduced in the late early/mid 2000's.  The producer of show the felt they needed a character that the more "special kids" could feel apart of the show.  This was the last ditch effort the big wigs would try to save the show.   So far, the ratings of the show have increased enough to keep it aired.  They should pull through for more seasons.  The real news is who plays the character "Flip", none other than the infamous graffiti artist, Banksy. 




 Plus, who the fuck is gonna tell someone over the internet not to adopt a pet.   




 Okay, none of you little dudes move until those two dudes get back! 
 Okay little dude, we know you're in here somewhere. We don't wanna hurt you, we just wanna kidnap you.  - Fester

 Waiting for IamPop. 




 Has anyone ever done this before 9/11. 




 How do you, AgeMarkus and Linkrobin know each other?  I went through Linkrobin's comments and saw that you would confront them on the repost.  Linkrobin just denies it in a funny niave way.  It was all pretty funny.   Fill me in on your story.

edit: The kicker is that robin  calls out everyone for reposting 




 They are probably coming from first class wearing suits like that.

 **Coming back to Reddit and that's what I see...** 




 Just gonna tag off you post.  I looked through dematteoArt comments and holy cow did it piss me off.  I actually signed in just to type this crap.  You keep telling people you educate your child, yet reading your comments just pissed me off how you typed everything out.  Usually never happens, but you somehow pulled it off.

 Wanna adopt me? 




 Don't tell me what to do!  You're not my real mom! 




 It's alright I'm 22 y/o college student.  I'm completely content with ramen, Dad.    




 Do you guys need a boy?  I'm up for adoption.

 If it doesn't exist, how would I have a picture of it?  huh..? HUH!? 

 




 My cat doesn't like tail-touching. 




 This is probably what I look like sniping in bf3 




 I like how they say "Good cop"

 Op forgot the S in his title.   









 I feel like this game has a great concept.  I think a nice layout of the HUD would make this game stand out over other FPS genres.  Plus with multiplayer, possibilities of game types and tweaks are limitless. 

If there is a game already like this or in the making, please let me know! 

 Note:  I'll expand more on this once I know this already doesn't exist. 
























 I have two habits, one I do more frequently than the other, whenever I am under those stages. The one I do the most is I put my backhand up to my face, so my knuckles are barely touching my lips. I than proceed to move my hand up and down so my lips hit each knuckle. I have no idea why I do this, but I been doing it since toddler I guess. The second, is that I take my thumb and pointer finger and gently rub my earlobe with my thumbnail ( --that could be wrong ) while applying pressure with my pointer. 

Both of these habits really soothes me I guess? I become relaxed and feel focused while doing one or another. What about you reddit? 

Do you have any strange habits? 





























 I need to find a bottom steering column plastic for a 2006 rav4 and I am in a time crunch, but the interwebs isn't showing anything.  
Anyone on Reddit got any places to order from?

Thanks!!
