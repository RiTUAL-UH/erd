 When Jack Kerouac's On the Road was first published in 1957 no one had ever seen anything quite like it. As it turns out, that stream of consciousness style that Kerouac made famous owes a huge debt to a letter written by his friend Neal Cassady.

 you are right there is just not a direct enough connection between what we use and what it costs either personally or globally

 you make it sound so sexy! 




 wow they did you are right - it was copied/pasted directly originally 




 That was one hot dog! 




  I expect we'll find out Jesus was bisexual, in an open marriage, and some otherkin's headmate. John the Baptist was a furry, by the way.

See now that is a book I would read 




 Thanks for adding that! 




 good to know was not aware of what it was called 




 But less controversial 




 Good catch

 Might need more cooling then though 




 I sort of wonder if there's a name for this kind of thing because I would like to find more too

 That's the story they say though it sounds like it might just be a legend 




 Skinny and stealthy 




 I assume they must be pretty valuable as collectors items 




 Or Ello. Just kidding! 




 Serves him right, since Lewinski. 




 Agreed! 




 I think that might be part of it. 




 I assume homicide to be implied. 




 Clearly you care to work so hard at going negative. 




 You really hardcore tagged that didn't you? 




 But where is it plugged in? Wait I don't want to know. 




 Negative 100 karma and counting? Nice!

 Thats great thanks for the link.

 As it was half-loaded on my screen I thought it was going to say: "You are my rock and this is my hard place" 




 "Well, we have worked out the half about bats blowing things up, but the other half ..." 




 yes, let's talk about it on the porch for a magazine interview! 




 The passing out does seem kind of inconsistent with the drug's profile 




 That would definitely be the best next step. 




 And it's only going to get worse! 




 The current Roosevelt Island Tramway waits are really short to non-existent most times of day and you can see when one is arriving above and time your own arrival around that. But it might be longer for more high-traffic routes like those being proposed here. 




 Cool! I saw it in another SubReddit and it seemed like a good fit for this one too :] 




 Relevance? 




 Woah. That's an amazing fact. TIL! 




 Extremely efficiently! 




 I was really hope it was going to be 'Generic Brand Butter' but this is even better!

 If you remember to repost this in 2026 I will give you fitty dollas when you do 




 Oooh, if you still have the box, you can return it for a new one! By the way: am I an idiot if it took me a second to get the 'came in' part of the joke?

 Nice balance of realistic and character-style. 




 As a diet or a trendy way to hide a diet, I don't know, but I do know someone who has a legitimate negative reaction to the stuff. 




 So much green. Wonderful. 




 Ah TY! 




 That one went over my head. Wat? 




 It was only a matter of time ... 




 Hard to say for sure. If she was going for a milk facial...wait that just sounds so wrong. 




 What a great list. Lots more variety and not so much image-only Subs. Should really bring up the quality and diversity of the front page. 




 Forever on the phone 




 Beautiful and thanks for the additional links too. 




 Maybe Siri's sick of your shit, too! 




 No problem! It's a pretty epic project :D 




 Somewhat more detail here: http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/farmers-in-sahel-beat-back-drought-and-climate-change-with-trees/ and here: http://planetsave.com/2013/04/21/the-great-green-wall-of-africa-a-4000-mile-defense-against-climate-change/

 The trees will act as a barrier against desert winds, help to hold moisture in the air and soil, reduce erosion, enhance biodiversity, provide new grazing land and be a source of vegetation. The project is also recognized for the role it will play in local agriculture and employment.  
People used to go to towns to seek paid work during the lean season, but since the project started, that has changed, says Papa Sarr, Technical Director of the Senegal National Agency of the Great Green Wall.

 Another two possibilities: the universe will expand forever and die or it will eventually contract and repeat indefinitely ... I find the latter so much more beautiful a thought. 




 Thanks, I think - useful to make this into a ... wallpaper one supposes? 




 I believe that's called a 'sun dog' 




 Someone submitted it here, but it was axed by modbot and they didn't delete it and resubmit it with the pixel data as the modbot asked them to, which left  it in limbo (unable to be resubmitted with the same URL but perfectly fine if the URL were different or if that submitter deleted their submission of it and someone else submitted it with pixel info). Then I found the URL variant and figured I would try that instead. Worked! Yay! 




 Crosspost != repost so ... confused by your question.

 Image is great, but it needs a background. Only has a foreground. Also needs a better font and possibly a background for that font. 




 We could pardon them too. 




 Is the other 0.001% actual kitten? 




 It was a good but strange listen. A good reminder that people take pride in things we might callously call cheap or ordinary, and that these things have long and interesting journeys to get to us. 




 Wouldn't that turn him into a martyr, though? 




 I agree - from a distance it could almost be a photograph. 




 OK, got it now - you're right - it's the mask on a stand waiting to be put on!

 Nice optical illusion
