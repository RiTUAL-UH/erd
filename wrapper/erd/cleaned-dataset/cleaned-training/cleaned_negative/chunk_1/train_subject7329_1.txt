 i have been using recreationally for about 10 years now and i am still relatively young at 30.  I have been really good with not getting out of control in the amount i take as well.  i have only done pills like vicodin, percocet, norco, etc. never smoked, snorted or iv anything.  i'd say the most i've taken at once was only around 30mgs and when i use its around 20mg so yeah i would like to think that i am pretty responsible with my habit. I have had morphine in the hospital and it was great but i couldn't function whatsoever and have never tried seeking it out otherwise.  getting to your question:  Man, that's a hard one.  I'd really like to hope things never get that bad where I would feel the need to shoot heroin.  I enjoy life and need to be a functioning member of society or at least try to be lol and i feel that if i was shooting up heroin then that wouldn't be possible.  I just feel like if life is so bad where you are using heroin and I have rarely heard of a heroin user who cannot go a day without using, then your fucked basically.  Who knows, I might end up one day going that route but i'd really not want to at this point in my life. hope this makes some sense.    




 haha yeah but this was exactly what i was going to put as a comment til i saw someone already posted it so i just copied and pasted it in agreement lol

Dude, stop thinking about it and don't look back. Your life can only improve without opiates.
 




 definately do not do it!! i drank a bottle of expired codiene once and fuck.......... long story short, lets just say it was one of the worst experiences of my life.  oh and the stuff i drank was maybe 2 years overdue.  but 1991?!?! LOL holy shit!!! 




 i would say shoegaze type music. think my bloody valentine or lush. 




 i'm not denying that you can score there. probably the easiest spot in the city actually but assuming this person is a white upper middle class looking dude who is walking thru the TL paints a funny picture to me haha.  anyways if he wants it that bad he'll find it. 




 damn your straight up telling this guy to go to the tenderloin hahaha.  i guess if you are that desperate.  i am from SF all my life and its common knowledge to stay clear of this area but hey i am sure he will find what he needs there. 




 wow be careful with that haha. hopefully she isn't driving while taking that pic too lol! 




 have you been on a large dose for a long time? i have been on 10/325 for about 8 months and never any issues. seems like a nosey person. even if you were on a large dose for a long time it shouldn't matter i don't thinks its really their business as the pharmichist is really just a middle man. 




 i thought trainspotting was really good. it seems unbiased. 




 i got a killer hang nail. need a morphine drip stat 




 yeah my buddy is trying to talk me into driving cross country to go there after seeing oxycontin express.  i said naw i'm cool off driving that far for a possibility of getting pills lol.  i tried to explain to him that as far as what i have heard things have tightened up quite a bit there. 




 yep florida in its heyday was amazing i bet........ 




 if you can somehow prove the nerve is exposed i bet you'll do ok.  i've had about 5 root canals. knocked a couple out and a couple due to grinding my teeth when i slept. i was given a small amount of 5/500s. 20 pills with 3 refills i believe.  this was all done in sf bay area so i dunno but thats my experience with that. 




 I think you might have to jump thru some hoops and stuff a bit but if you have around 300 bucks you probably will get something.  I was about to go this route but needed a referral plus xrays from an immediate care place and it was getting too pricey so i didn't even do it.  I wasn't too into dropping that much $$ for potentially ending up with nothing.   




 i do tonic water sometimes. seems to help but i think its just a placebo effect.
 




 ive tried grapefruit juice for potentiation. didn't seem to do shit for me.   




 yeah i know. i'm not looking for opanas anyways haha
 




 never tried opana.  actually never really even heard of it til about a year ago.  anytime i'd get anything good for pain it was always just generic vicodin 5/500s and now finally norcos but it was never even discussed with my doc about percs, opana or other opiates. maybe because i have kaiser and they don't do business with the makers of opana and percocet?  because aren't those just the brand names?  like norco is the brand name of 10/325 hydrocodones too right?!!??  when kaiser prescribed me them they are generics and made by mallikondrit or whatever company that is.  i suppose if i wanted to i could ask for the brand name but it'd be way more expensive. sorry for all the noobish questions haha!!
 




 is that the ingredient in percocet? if so i have hads percs before. really weak 2.5's tho haha. they were white with blue speckles. 




 i'd say you are lucky to even have a dealer!! haha its pretty much impossible for me to find anything on the streets where i am.  plus the fact that he seems to lag is a characteristic seen in almost every drug dealer its like instilled in them to be flaky/late.  you'd think that dealers would be capable of being on time if all they have to do is hand over some pills and make a grip of money all in under a few mins but for some reason at least for the people i have dealt with almost don't want to make the easiest money ever. 




 yeah but if you say that you might run the risk of the doctor running you thru a buncha shit like xrays/ct scans etc thinking he will need to re operate or something.  i have been thru a similar experience is why i say this. in the end i didnt get any more meds but ended up spending a couple hundred bucks and wasting a lot of time.   




 yeah i can def see that happening.  i am usually best when i'm alone since a few times people have kinda killed my buzz when they have tried to have conversations with me haha.  sounds kinda selfish but yeah.  its kinda like i gotta focus on my high and not do anything that requires a lot of thinking lol.  I only use 20mg hydrocodone to just buzz so i'm obviously not nodding out.   




 yeah either that or the acetominophen.  i mean how much would there be if you really ingested 100mg of actual hydrocodone?  a lot, that's all i know haha.  i think it is just shitty reporting/wrong facts/reporters don't know shit about medicine.  
 




 yeah i can see how that happens like when i drink sometimes i get overly emotional but luckily for me never happens on opiates. always a good mood.   




 my point exactly!?!? i dunno man. some people pointed out opi rage which i have never encountered. 




 ive never taken near 100mg of vicodin haha.   




 ahh ok.  i have never experienced that. opposite effect on me.   




 noob question, but what is opi rage?  i have heard the term used before but can only speculate as to what it means. 




 good luck mine were impacted needed to be cut out and i got darvocet woohoo!!! 




 i'd think taking 100mg of vicodin would make him mellow out and not want to shoot anyone if having any effect at all on how he acted.  always makes me feel way more peaceful and less angry/agitated. just my 2cents. 




 why the fuck would you post this disclaimer or not.   




 i've taken them before. they were weird shaped but had that cursive v on them like the 5/500 vics i'm used to. anyways they weren't that great it felt like i had to take a lot to get anywhere but i did feel it a bit.  
 




 yeah i'm basically in the same boat. i just kinda went through the motions and graduated high school.  then at least when i went to college i was able to have a lot more control of the type of classes i could take so it was a bit easier but i still hate sitting in a classroom for x amount of hours. i know a lot of people that use add/adhd as an excuse for a lot of their shortcomings and it's just annoying. 




 never tried adderall but i was on dexedrine which is similar to ritalin i believe.  i dunno, i was in middle school when i was prescribed it for "adhd"  i quote that because i seriously can't say if i have it or not.  its kinda a crutch a lot of people use for being dumb shits imo haha. anyways, that shit didn't really do much other than make me loose my appetite and not want to eat much.  I only took them for a few years.  I have noticed that when i take opiates i am a lot more easy going and just in a better mood all together than when i'm not on them.   




 i have done the raid the medication drawer thing many a time before.  i felt/ feel really shitty about doing it but it was impossible for me not to grab a few pills when they are right there in front of me. most of the time it was just 5/500 vicodins that were leftovers (i checked the dates on the bottles if i had enough time).  that doesn't justify what i did though i know.  this was before i was able to get a legit script and i haven't done it since.  




 sorry to say but you are an alcoholic.  I went thru something similar for a few years straight.  Just try to go 24 hours without any booze.  Once you get that first day, it get way easier after that. 




 10 bucks for 60 10/325's a month from my doc.  I think I can afford that!! 




 i've actually never tried tramadol. heard it was not gonna do anything and i don't want to take any more pills than I need to so yeah i just chucked the script i had for like 20 of them.  i have had darvocet if it is like that. 




 to add onto what i just posted the last time i got tramadol i just threw it out. i thought it wouldn't do anything for me and i'm a lightweight (20mgs hydrocodone and i'm good)  is tramadol even comparable to say 5/500's?
 




 all this over tramadol?!?!   




 and yeah i always knew it was spelled contin not cotton. duh. haha. 




 i did?? i dunno, it wasn't intentional.  i guess i am not good at using this thing haha. 




 ah i thought you opiate users were supposed to me mellowwww broooo!!   




 i believe that is how mr wyte spells it! 




 the link:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMLtj6qSsc 









 yeah they do the job for me! 




 lol i know this. read the comments i already posted!! 




 thanks man. only a couple a day work for me i'm not trying to get too crazy here haha 




 i know that and i'm not snorting them haha wtf.  i don't like swallowing pills so i usually just crush em.  this is a lot better than what i use to have to take- 5/500s.  i don't use a lot anyways i take like 2 a day 




 why wouldn't you? but you know best so tell me why not 




 you mean physically big?? they aren't when you crush em!! 









 Interesting. I now have a new bookmark and that kinda means a lot because I rarely bookmark shit hahaha 




 i had some prescribed to me and didnt want to take them cause I knew they wouldnt do shit and nobody would buy them off me so i threw em out.  i'd say they are useless. 




 if you have 1 or 2 beers you should be fine.  at least you arent taking 500's. I'd be worried most of the apap but i still wouldnt pop 6 10/325s and drink any alcohol at the same time though.  I will admit in the past i have drank and taken pills at the same time but i'm talking a few beers and 1 norco.  Its a good mellow feeling and intensifies both the beer buzz and the opiate high but I don't mix pills/alcohol anymore. 




 thats tough. i just turned 30 and look a lot younger so its been really hard for me to get docs to even to give me anything even though i have quiet a file at my hospital for surgeries/ dumb accidents. but yeah hopefully you feel better with that medicine and you are able to be functional!!  




 damn thats gnarly and you are only in your 20's!?!  i'm sorry to hear that- back injuries suck!  good luck with your pain management.   




 not trying to be a dick but how do you get these prescribed to you then turn around and be able to flaunt it to the net?!? shouldnt you be keeled over in pain right now!?!?!  (jealous)  




 btw what state are you in?? i am in california, bay area. 




 thats total bullshit. i am in the same boat as you i believe.  young, in actual real pain yet I do like to take pills and I will admit i love the way they make me feel.  I have quite an extensive file for injuries/surgeries for my young age so that is to my advantage but yeah its still fucking stupid how dumb it is to legally get anything. even 5mg vics. so what else is there for people like us to do?!?! i'm not gonna start going on the streets to find heroin, i know that much.....  right now i got my doc to scribe me 10/325 norcos. i only take 2 a day so i am barely scraping the surface of most of the peoples use on this reddit but i feel guilty already with that. it sucks cause i had to even build up to that with my doc!!  anyways that was really lame of her to judge you, i've had docs do that to me before. 




 that sucks, that doc sounds like a fucking dick.  were you really pressing him or trying to get some really strong shit that he would obviously know you were just going to abuse!?!?   




 they work a ton faster and are much safer than a razor blade imo!! 




 i've had that one but the clear and blue pod looking one works better for me. 




 I have owned that exact same one as in the pic.  I have a bit different styled one now that i believe works better. I think i got it at wallgreens 




 I always notice it kills my buzz when i start eating that is why i usually ingest on an empty stomach. 




 i usually only get presealed bottles made by qualitest via kaiser so i assume that they are going to be accurate. 




 non existent  




 For me its having a longtime doctor that trusts me to responsible with what she prescribes me (lortab 10's).  I have been good about not burning thru them quickly so i always get my refills.    




 yeah muscle relaxers. i have a shitload of samples of them for some reason. never taken any though.  they are probably expired now. 




 thats about when i had mine taken out.  I hadnt discovered opiates yet so i didn't even both to ask the surgeon but i shouln't of had to- its his job to prescribe what is needed for pain and trust me i was in pain for about a week after with only ibu 800s woohoo!!! 




 You got so damn lucky.  I didnt get any narcotics for mine and my wisdoms were impacted!!! 




 never used it but have been to it.  seems too risky and most people on there seem like scammers.  not taking a risk sending cash to someone i don't know without any knowing that i will ever receive my product. 




 ok i wasnt sure as I have never messed with any pill like that but they work great on regular pills. 




 for several things but mainly because I have been getting my whole mouth filled with dental implants due to grinding them away when i sleep.  also had to have about 5 pulled and have gum surgery on my upper gums.  Other than that I have had about 5 surgeries for broken bones just from dumb luck.  I am relatively young too (30 y/o) so my doc is really sympathetic to my condition haha!! 




 $10 for my prescription of lortab 10's.  i get 60 of them about every month.  I'm not a heavy user so i think I can afford 10 bucks about every month or so haha. 




 get a pill crusher from wallgreens or somewhere like that. i do it with norcos and take them orally and it hits me harder than if i just popped it.  I never have had your kinda pills so not positive it would work with them but it def. does with a regular pill. 




 i doubt you'll get anything. i've had about 5 done and never get anything. the point of a root canal is to end the pain you have been having.   




 near chico ca and its dry as fuck out here..... 




 how do you guys get so much strong shit prescribed to you?!?!?!   




 I am near chico and you would think it'd be easy to find something but I havent had any luck!!!
