 as far as I can tell, winter, summer (which it is currently and he drove past just recently) 




 the guy who drives the icecream truck around my area does seem pretty happy.  




 Ha, could create some awkward situations. 

So these are now on my list. Thanks! 
My list is growing, and I'm really focusing on these few words/ sounds. *thumbs up*

Edit: kinda reads like I want to create awkward situations. I didn't mean it like that.

 




 I know, and I admire your guts and bravery.

  I accidentally de-scabbed a cat once, no pus involved,  but I couldn't eat anything for a few days after. So gross. So very very gro...*retch* 




 I feel so awful for you, what a shitty thing to happen. I hope it works out and those horrid people don't get anything from you. 

Don't blame yourself too much, I know people who have eloped after a short amount of time and have been happily married for years with no signs of trouble. You trusted someone, that's not a bad thing.  




 I think you fuck up is picking your cats scab. I'm going to vomit now.

But good on you for caring about your pets, but gross still. gross. 




 this.

I'm vegetarian, but if I had to eat meat it would be hunted, wild, free range (legally killed).
I will never ever eat any commercially, mass produced meat, that is barbaric and something we don't need to do. 
Use this as as opportunity to educate your wife. 




 hahahaha. 
Thanks, I had a good giggle at that. 
I am adding them to my list.  




 thanks for the links: checking them out now.

and taking note of schwul and schwl  




 noted, thank you.  




 I'm not really worried, just curious, also I think knowing small things like this will probably help with learning pronunciation generally- give me an area to focus on and perfect, while avoiding embarrassing situations.  




 I've been laughing at this out loud for a long while.  




 I was 21, would definitely take it back, it was awful. It was about 5 in the morning and as soon as he was done, I got dressed an ran all the way home through the rain, freezing cold, crying, it was terrible.  




 This reminded me of when a stranger said to me "you have a black and white cat, do you miss him?"

I do have a black and white cat and he lives at my parents so I rarely see him, I do miss him.

Once the man walked away I checked myself all over for cat hairs...none...He was just magic.  




 When I travelled over to the US, I got very drunk, had a super bad hangover, so my friends left me at the house of one of their sisters to sleep while they went out. 
I woke up after a nice nap and realised I had absolutely no idea where I was or how to get to my friends. fortunately the friends sisters housemate was home and gave me some water, offered me a bread roll, let me pat his dog and gave me directions. 

He was nice.  




 Saw a lady had twin daughters one called something like Kate- normal, not at all wtf...

Her twin: Twinae. like Twin-A, like the doctor labelled her that on the scan and the parents thought "lovely, perfect name for our child" 

Also know a lady called Gay Crack. 

also:
Anytime a parent chooses "Nevaeh" a part of me dies.  




 If my parents truly loved me, they would have named me this.  




 I was just doing some reading on language for uni, one example in the reading was about how people who speak English as a second language will avoid saying certain words (example was 'sheet') because they worry about pronouncing it wrong (example:sheet becomes shit), and asking "Where can I buy shits?" is a bit embarrassing, I guess.

I'm currently an Australian learning German, are there any words that I might have this problem with? I'm finding German pronunciation to be quite difficult, particularly 'ch'  




 Have you watched Louis Therouxs "A Place for Paedophiles"? Because if no, you should, it's pretty depressing.  




 When I was in school (year 9 maybe) I got in some trouble after a teacher found stuff I'd written about modern medicine and how it's counter-productive to the continuation of a healthy human species. 

But, if I had a serious life-threatening condition I would not hesitate to seek medical help, even if it's natures way of saying "you're weak, we don't need you"

I was an angry teenager, my views have relaxed a lot since then 




 100% yes, 
When I was a kid I got really upset when I learned I couldn't freely travel the world.
Why? This is my world, I want to be a part of it all. 
 




 anarchy all the way 




 But then when the elderly inevitably die, the world loses them anyway, and hopefully if they have anything valuable to contribute to society, they already have in someway and recorder or passed on their knowledge. 
The young are full of unknown potential (many of them may be completely useless) but losing them is potentially worse than losing an elderly person who's value we are already aware of.  




 I've never thought about this, but it kinda makes sense, even if I feel bad for saying it.  




 There should be a one child policy in all/ most countries, the population of earth is already at unsustainable levels in some places, and it's only getting worse. 




 thanks, I'll check it out. 
I sometimes play youtube videos for them, like 'count the trains' kind of thing. they get into it, but their counting goes something like "two two two eight eight eight eight ten!" But they are enthusiastic about it, it's cute. 
 




 In case some talented women wish to grow a nice mo, Manuary is exclusive, Movember is inclusive. 




 yep, and they are improving, but slowly.  




 got confused by 
Blacks and whites
vs
African American and proper terminology

 




 I have never heard of sensory vests, sounds interesting.

They do have visual schedules, but the boys don't really pay too much attention to it.  




 of course, I wont think of them any differently if they have ASD :) I have worked with autistic (and other disabilities) children before, and adored them all. 
unfortunately, even with that experience, I struggle with the twins. My sister (their mother) told me yesterday that she had to wrap one twin in a blanket and hug him for a while to calm him down because he was trying to destroy the house... I think having to resort to things like that makes her question her parenting. 
we have tried time out, other calming techniques with them, but they don't really work. but i think preventing the tantrums with fun activities is the way to go. 

so I will check out r/autism, might find many more ideas and advice. good suggestion, thank you. 

I have been trying to figure out how to get bean bag supplies and make them before thursday (when i see them next), but maybe I will just get them to throw their teddies instead haha. might be an inside game... 

and thanks for talking, it really is helping, and making me feel a lot more positive about things 




 no official diagnosis, although Autism Spectrum has been mentioned. 
They are great kids, I feel bad watching them struggle when their other siblings are doing so well, watching their sister who is 2 years younger than them doing better in a lot of areas than they are is really heartbreaking, and they are at the age now where they are aware of this. It doesn't take much for them to lash out and turn violent from frustration. 
I really like the bean bag idea, it's so simple but seems like something they will enjoy, and I think I could even make the things myself, so that's this weeks project.  




 Hello and thank you!

Yes, they see a speech and physical therapist, so I think they cover a lot in their sessions, speech, enunciation, posture and eating/swallowing etc. 

Thanks for the suggestions, I'm heading off to google to do some research, they really seem like excellent ideas, and I truly appreciate it. 

I just worry about their development, and I know their parents do too, they also go to kindy one day a week which they are benefiting from, but I think more home activities will be really good for them. 

thanks again 




 Don't wear clothes, your body needs to 'breathe', you'll feel much happier and healthier that way.  




 Gosh yes, my family doesnt approve, but since cutting my sister and her boyfriend out of my life, I feel far less stressed.  




 makes my head hurt too, what memories, thoughts, dreams, hates and loves are in that brain?  




 Hi parents,

I'm an aunty to four year old twin boys (and their 6 year old brother and 2 year old sister) 
I babysit them 1-4 days a week while their mother is studying. 

The twins have severe speech delay, they talk at about a 2yo level, although they are intellectually normal, their speech affects their behaviour I believe, they get frustrated very easily and it doesnt take them long to go from quietly playing nicely, to throwing bricks at each other. 

I have no idea how to entertain them, they wont sit still for long, they wont read books with me, they like to throw things, so its hard to play organised games with them, they don't really follow instructions very well. 
They spend most of their time digging in dirt in their backyard and playing with trucks or cars. 

Outside play is good for children, i know, but I feel like for their development they need a variety of activities but I'm just stuck for ideas. 

their parents also have no idea how to entertain them. 

thanks  




 has it been useful? good quality? worth using? 




 Use realeastate.com.au or domain.com.au to look up rental places, lots of share houses listed regularly or units, you can search by map too which is helpful 




 Uh, excuse me,  but South Australia was founded my people of good character only.   




 not interested because she's crazy. go with that.  




 this- plus
I'd recommend stopping the drunken sexy times with her- if you are looking for a serious relationship with her. You need to back off a little because I don't think its a healthy way to start a relationship.  




 the egg that made me began inside my mums mum, which just weirds me out 




 why is it bad for children to have sex when they will grow up to have sex anyway? 

some things are wrong 




 I havent played murder in the dark for so many years. Next time I'm with a group of friends....  




 I would have closed the door and found a new toilet to use, I admire your efforts and determination.  




 reminds me of the first time I got really really drunk, I tried catching fireworks, nearly vomited on a sleeping friend (missed by cm's), sang a few childrens songs, begged for my mum...
While I thought I'd just got a bit drunk then went to bed quietly. 

Put me off raspberry and coconut flavoured things for a long long time, 5 years later and it's still iffy.  




 looks challenging, I prefer the simple, already coloured books.  




 I agree, it's not a good scenario, but that poor guy is desperate to help is child, its a lose- lose situation.  




 TIL if you hold the mouse under a foot while waiting at the door, then meow normally, the humans will let you and the mouse inside.  




 naw, I get regular hugs from a red kangaroo and regular bites from the greys.  




 once an elderly couple ignored those signs and tried to overtake my dad (truck driver here in aus), the car got stuck under the front of his truck and he pushed them a few 100 metres down a busy main road because he didn't see them there, he wasnt aware until he stopped at lights. 
He pretty much covered the front of his truck in mirrors after that.  




 Dying is bad for her, the smoke is nothing in comparison to a serious illness.  




 the sounds they are making are just...blergh, so gross.  




 And it does take so long. A long boring repetitive task.  




 "blatantly stupid" might do it 




 are you sure you aren't being lied to and you are actually in some kind of 'home' ? 




 well, it was released... but not necessarily unharmed, fear and stress can easily be fatal for kangaroos.  




 yep, kangaroos growl and hiss and cluck and tsk and bark.  




 As a female, I have one shaved leg, one hairy leg because I got bored.  




 my life is a series of half-arsed attempts 




 There's a good lookout spot in vista, just up from cyress crescent I believe.  
 




 My dad once asked if I wanted to go surfing with him, I told him "No, I don't want to get eaten by a shark"
He replied with "Live until you die" 

I still didn't go surfing though, but I try to not miss out on fun things due to fear.
Living a good life and dying young must be better than living a dull life and dying old.  




 So this is a little old,  but thought I'd add... try a darker hair colour, brown would be safest by dark red could work too, grow your hair a little longer and try a wavy style, go to a stylist to get this done and get your eyebrows waxed and tinted. 

Braces probably too, if it's possible,  it did so much for my appearance.  
Good luck 




 I like the beard too,  but I think you should grow your hair out a bit,  then wait for the braces to come off and you'll be fine.   




 Agree. 
Although, as a beard lover,  continue to grow that stubble out, not too long,  just enough to define your jaw area. Ace. 

Then punch your 'friend' again.  




 I love it! A plot I wouldn't have even imagined, it's great!
It was positive and depressing all at the same time.  




 Hey look, there's me.  
My head is hurting trying to understand how I am 'in' this photo.  The worlds so big and I'm a puny human 









 Recently my friend was grieving the death of one of her rescued kangaroos,  the other kangaroos all came and put their hands on her and stayed with her as she cried,  even though they aren't really cuddly animals most of the time 




 This warms my heart, what a lovely dog 




 A few years ago I was walking my two dogs,  ones a mix breed (monti) and the other a dalmatian (maisie) who was very intelligent and a lovely dog.  
Anyway,  as we were walking monti was a little further ahead of me and maisie, Maisie starts slowly creeping up on monti,  obviously planning to pounce on him. 
As she was getting closer, mont turned around to look at her and she instantly switched to a casual jog, looked away from monti and acted like nothing was going on.  As soon as monti looks away maisie starts her sneaking again.  
This repeated a few more times until maisie got close enough to jump on monti.  
It was hilarious to watch,  I think it really showed a sense of humour and planning beyond what dogs at usually given credit for.

And another:
My parents had two galahs (parrot), both unable to fly that lived in their backyard,  every morning (that I observed) they would sit up on the roof of their cage and watch the sunrise together. Like really just stare out at it and occasionally groom one another.  So romantic.   




 Peter III of Russia caught a rat that had chewed at his toy soldiers.  After a trial, the rat was sentenced to hanging,  on the gallows Peter III built himself.  
Although I think this is more a wtf-you 




 I wanted to be a teacher and now I'm studying to be a teacher but it's not my dream job anymore.   




 I think a lot of things that are or could be labeled as supernatural could potentially be just othernatural, the universe in infinite and if we consider the possibility of other dimensions, then it will likely be impossible for us to really know or theorise about everything that may exist. 
eg- ghosts, I don't really believe in ghosts as they are described in horror/ popular stories, but I can accept that the chance of them existing in some form is possible. 
We don't really understand conciousness as it is, it might be that our conciousness continues on in some form after we die. maybe then we find out what living in a 2D world is like or something. 

I think I am more supernatural agnostic rather than believe though.  




 i guess that if you spent x number of years expecting and believing God will be there for you, you will not easily break that habit. 
I have never believed in Gods, I have never felt the need for external higher power assistance in my life because I know that any help I need will come from the physical world around me, or from me. 

I have always believed that prayers are simply positive thinking, and positive thinking is benefitial, so I don't see anything wrong with you still praying, even if there is no God to answer you.  




 I feel like having a colour one would give me the ability to paint like van Gogh...right? 
I associate colours with numbers,  but it is pretty mild and sometimes vague so it could basically not happen and I wouldn't notice.  

Are they boring personalities? 




 As someone said,  a suicide hotline, or a hospital,  police,  teachers if you are at school, there should be a lot of people able to help your friend. 
In my town (in Australia) there is a number you can call to speak to a psychiatrist,  and they do house visits also. You might have something similar in your area.

 I'm Australian but for whatever reason assume everyone else is American.  
 




 Life is short 




 Put a pasty in the oven today for the crispy pastry, gave up waiting after a minute and microwaved it and had to deal with the soggy pastry. Life is hard 




 My boyfriend has very few memories of his childhood and is amazed when I recall various things from mine. I remember my first easter when I was 11mo. That's probably my earliest memory.  Chocolate.   




 Don't deal with it alone, contact his family or friends and remove yourself from the situation. 
Your friend is not responsible for him or his life, do what you need to to get him help and then leave and don't feel guilty if the worst happens.  




 Agree with this, take some time, talk to your boyfriend, talk to your family. Don't let those awful disgusting people dictate your life.  




 I have felt like this a few times, like I have completely messed up everything beyond repair. 
But I never really did, after a few days or weeks or months things would improve, because I wanted them to, not because I was lucky or whatever, I worked really hard to get my life back on track.
 




 Oh gosh,  mine seems quite alright compared to that.  I love monopoly,  life without it must be hard.   




 1. Grapheme-colour and Sound-motion
2. When I was young, 7-10 maybe, my sister gets some versions of synesthesia also, we were discussing once what colours various numbers were and our other sister didn't know what we were talking about as she doesn't have synesthesia, but it was a few years later in my teens when I learned about synesthesia.
4. It's sort of neutral, doesn't help or hinder most of the time. But the Sound-motion makes me dizzy sometimes and I would gladly do without it. 
5. I sometimes will choose things based on their number, or avoid them for the same reason. eg. I have an appointment for the 20th and not the 21st because 20 is a nicer colour (pastel purple/pink)  than 21 (brown/ green, kinda camo) 




 Hi everyone, 
I'm just wondering if anyone else has a negative experience with synesthesia, as I mainly read about it as a positive thing. 

I have mild grapheme-colour synesthesia, which doesn't bother me at all, but I get sound-motion synesthesia really bad sometimes and it makes me feel really dizzy. 

basically, it just sucks, and with all fun forms of synesthesia, I get this one.

 Sometimes a fake one would be preferable. But she is 100% real.  




 I've pretended to be religious, or at least pretend to not be atheist...which I guess is the same thing... in lesser situations. 
The thing with religious people is they fear losing something (eternal life or whatever) if they renounce their religion, so they would rather die than risk losing that. 
For me, there is no after life, there is only this life, why would I give that up?  









 "No!" Replied the mother,  "just flush like everyone else" 




 TIFU (a few years ago) when I went to do some shopping, a very frail looking old man came up to me and asked if I could help him with his suspenders-
One strap at the back had come undone.
Being the super helpful member of the community that I am,  I said 'of course!' and clipped the strap back into place.  
The old man turned to look at me with his gentle, sweet old man face,  held my hand and said 'thank you, dear', in his quiet and quivering voice, turned back around and walked off. 

Then I noticed I'd clipped the strap of his suspenders onto his underwear instead of his pants. 
Gave the poor man a wedgie.
