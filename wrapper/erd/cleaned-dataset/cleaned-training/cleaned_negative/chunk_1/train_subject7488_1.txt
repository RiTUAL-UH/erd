 Here's one for 299 starting bid, and its new: http://pages.ebay.com/link/?nav=item.view id=141600217704 alt=web 
If you bid for $300 for it, no one will outbid you. Personally though, I would get the sandstone black (64gb) version. I mean, 4 times the storage and only $50 more! In comparison, that change costs $200 in an iPhone. 




 Here's one that's up for bidding for $239, new in box. I'll link more. http://pages.ebay.com/link/?nav=item.view id=171720294080 alt=web 




 For the 16 gig $280 




 For the sandstone black (64gb) version, about $330 instead of $350. 




 Buy a used, but in new condition one from ebay.
