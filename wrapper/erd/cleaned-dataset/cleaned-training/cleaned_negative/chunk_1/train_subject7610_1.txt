 There are no negative effects to raising the minimum wage unless the wage is already at the maximum the market can support.  Given the lack of power those making minimum wage have there is little to no fear of that happening.

 Yes, the Lions were coming off the worst season in NFL history, but he was being offered one of only 32 NFL head coaching jobs in the world. What was he going to do? Say no thanks, I'll wait for the next one.  









 Or anywhere for that matter. You basically have two part-time players instead of a full-time + part-time. 



























































 Here is my 2 cents about last nights disappointment.  

End of the 7th, Scherzer's pitch count was at 108 and he was looking mortal.  
  
Start the 8th with Veras, the unofficial set-up man. Get one out, give up hit bringing up Ellsbury.  
Ellsbury has a marked L/R split, so pull Veras for Smyly whom doesn't deliver.  
  
Since Victorino is only batting righty and Smyly's L/R OPSa is .446/.648 pull him for AlAl.  

With Alburquerque's tendencies I don't like bringing him in with runners on but he K's Victorino.  
Now AlAl gives up a single to Pedroia loading the bases for Big Papi.  
Leyland decides to go with his main reliever Benoit.

This is a bad situational match-up, while Benoit had not allowed Ortiz a xBH in 26 PA (.273 SLG), with the bases loaded you don't go with a guy allowing a .385 OBA to the hitter.  
Especially when you have an Ortiz killer in the bullpen.  
  

Phil Coke has faced Ortiz 20 times with a triple slash of .150/.167/.317  
    
Why would you activate Coke and not use him in the very situation he was made for?
  
Edit: Thank you to /u/wjg10 for the link the breakdown over at [Fangraphs](http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/assigning-responsibility-for-david-ortiz/)  
  
TL;DR It wasn't a fastball down the middle. They call it a splitter (I've seen slider elsewhere) on the outside edge just above the knees. If Benoit missed with the pitch it was not by much. 














 I started to get blocked at work for subreddits this morning and the messages said it was because they belong to the restricted category Pornography according McAfee Smartfilter XL.
