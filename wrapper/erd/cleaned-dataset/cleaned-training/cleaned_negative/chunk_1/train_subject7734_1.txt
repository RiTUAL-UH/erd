* Do you get paid to sift through sites or is it an added on job to what you already do?

* Do the hosts understand Reddit?

* Are you an active member or just a lurker?

* Can you get me a job doing this? I know how to spend too much time on Reddit.

* Can you get one of the hosts to wear a reddit alien on the air?
