 Awesome! thanks for the info! 




 I am looking for the telescope part for my K101 Mod. Long story short, silly me shredded the inside wall where my RBA screws in. Any ideas on where to get a new piece? Any help at all would be great! 




 Thank you for calling Lapras Prince Air the Avatar and not fucking Air Jordan. What kind of a damn nickname is Air Jordan. Stupid. 




 Laughed way too hard at this 




 AMAZING. Now I have to rewatch some of the old episodes to reminisce, i am so excited

 You are right it does have 10 legs. Just a bit of background info, I was on my deck smoking a cig and I happened to spy a black spot on the ground. Came across this god forsaken creature. 









 Could not stop laughing. Bravo
