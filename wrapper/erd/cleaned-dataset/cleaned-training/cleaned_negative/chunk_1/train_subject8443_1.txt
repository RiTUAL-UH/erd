 I'm a huge fan of the Sennheiser MKH 50, very warm sounding and not a lot of ceiling noise. 
But I know the Oktava MK-012 is very good too and much cheaper.  Both are good, but I think the MKH 50 will take you further.  




 I am a location sound mixer, and Me66 isn't bad, but I will almost always reach for a 416 first.  The 416 is really the industry standard for shotgun mics, so if you are planning on building up a kit it is a far better investment than a Me66.

And absolutely get a 302 or better to use with either mic as the H4n simply will not get you the best audio quality from those mics. 
Good luck!
