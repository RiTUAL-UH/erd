 What region is it for, NA or EU? 




 There once used to be a super monster known as Kali, when she went jungling and got all three buffs she would be invulnerable. 




 Neith rank 9, going to be first to ten :D 




 Just send me a message over reddit or add me IGN: train_subject8459 and we can talk. 




 Neith being my favorite god, I would love this. 




 I would love the Kali skin because I'd love to have a convention skin and also because It's one of the only good Kali skins. 




 I honestly would love to see a 2v2 tournament because I only have 1 friend who I really play with, it really sucks that I want to enter but I don't have a team, mainly because of timezone issues so people I do add are all on different times. 




 Haha the trading in Civ 5 is fucked, I offered the Celts everything I had for a defensive pact, they said no :/
