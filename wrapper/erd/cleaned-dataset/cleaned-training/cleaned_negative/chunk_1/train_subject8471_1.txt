 I mean, I know that it's not always accurate, but geez, in most cases it's a good first-approximation. 




 My brain (too much time on reddit). 




 [Jungledisk](http://jungledisk.com/).  It creates encrypted remote backups on Amazon S3. 














 Wait ... what!?! I thought Jon Stewart **destroyed** him!  Reddit, you lied to me again! 









 Next you're going to tell me that a 10yo girl can't hack into a Unix box and restore power to an entire complex by herself! 




 Kind of reminds me of the 80yo guy who goes to confession.  He says, "Father, I just slept with this beautiful girl."
"OK.  Let's start at the beginning.  How long since your last confession?"
"I've never been to confession.  I'm not even Catholic."
"Then why are you telling me this?"
"Father, I'm 80 years old.  I'm telling EVERYBODY."
 




 Just watch out for the goat, see? 




 Friendship: You're doing it wrong. 









 Here's a free idea, in case you want to spend more time thinking you're accomplishing something:

 One night I was out with some friends, and we were waiting on the subway platform, and there was this "performer" singing.  She was terrible.  I mean really bad.  After a few minutes I walked over and offered her $2 if she would *stop* singing until the train came.  She agreed.  My friends were divided into "What an asshole", and "he's my hero" camps.  To this day, I really don't see the problem, but my wife is still embarrassed about it.

(sorry for the headache-inducing color scheme, but it really is the best online drill app).

And this one:

And there's a great Latin study group: http://www.quasillum.com/latin/latin-activities.php

You'll also want to get Groton   May's _38 Latin Stories_ which I keep in the bathroom.

I've been self-studying Wheelocks for about a year and a half, and though it's slow going, it's rewarding.

Festina Lente, et Vale!

 The fact that reddit is filling up with all these stupid AskReddit posts. 






















































 A couple of years ago I had the idea for a joke site where users could submit jokes and vote other users' jokes up or down.   Hmmm ... sounds familiar.  Anyways, I didn't do a good job of promoting it, but here it is: a href="http://funnyr.com/"funnyr.com/a
