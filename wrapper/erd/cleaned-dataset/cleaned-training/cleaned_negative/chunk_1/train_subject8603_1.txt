 [Squirtle](http://i.imgur.com/PdghU.jpg) might have something to say about that. 




 What is this I don't even

Self fulfilling prophecy. Thanks guys.

 Agreed. I ordered a sample off their website and couldn't make it through more then a few bottles of water before I had a splitting headache. Red 40 will do that to you.  




 Yup. Some places I've gone to add some mint to the sauce, but I really don't like the taste of mint outside gum and some mixed alcohols.  




 I have that exact camera :D [http://i.imgur.com/YthFJ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/YthFJ.jpg)

 Killin' It with Paul Crik. I don't know what it is about him, but the amount of work he puts into his videos for the inexplicably low number of views, I find it really strange. [Link to Youtube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/KillinItwithPaulCrik) 




 Thanks for pointing that out. I've been using the Spotify app in that shitty emulated phone view for weeks. 




 I lived in Japan for 15 years before moving to America. This really takes me back. Thanks for making it. 




 If you're willing to pay about $1 a month, you can download Paper Mache which lets you use Instapaper to download pages for offline viewing.  




 It's gotten incredibly common lately and should be easily found at any grocery store. But if for some reason you can't find any, you can buy regular plain yogurt and strain it with some cheese cloth and get the same result. 









 They're referred to as husband and wife. I don't know if there was a marriage ceremony between a real cow and bull, but symobically they are married.  









 I guess I'll be going with the free option. I've done a lot of the recommendations off HP's support forums to no avail. Was there a specific number you had to call for Touchpad support or was it just the HP support number? 




 Man. What a pain. I guess I'll just have to deal with having to carry headphones along with me wherever I go. Thanks for the info. 




 This is really annoying. The left speaker went out the day after I bought it but I just dealt with it since the right speaker was plenty loud enough for what I needed it for. Now my right speaker is out for some inexplicable reason. It had been working earlier in the day, but when I got home from work, the speaker had just stopped putting out sound. The sound works fine if I plug in headphones, but is a pain. Has anyone else had this problem and maybe fixed it themselves, or am I going to have to get in touch with HP Support in the hopes that they can either fix it or send me a replacement.  




 Tell me about it. I ordered 2 of them for my family and had them send me their money so I could mod and ship it to them. Now I have to keep my eye out for future sales so that I don't feel like I ripped them off. Still salty about the whole thing, but whatever. Good luck on future snagging one in the future though! Hopefully its not a repeat of this debacle.

*edit*
Nevermind, apparently OnSale is just a shitty vendor that doesn't know how to limit their sales to their limited inventory. 




 Interested, but why is it called a FB454UT Smartbuy TouchPad? 




 Pretty weaboo, but I have yet to find anything that can replace [this.](http://i.imgur.com/hEgti.jpg)
