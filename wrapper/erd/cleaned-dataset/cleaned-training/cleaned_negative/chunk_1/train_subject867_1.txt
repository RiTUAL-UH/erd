 I think I've always had vague knowledge of the holocaust, like my parents probably gave me a toned down summary of it when I was maybe 6/7/8. In fourth grade I started reading tons of books on the holocaust, by fifth grade I had a lot of knowledge about it. Of course, everything that happened in the holocaust was horrifying and maybe not the best subject material for a grade schooler. But I think it was great when I started learning more about it because it's important thing to remember.

My parents are also paranoid about the state of antisemitism around the world and are prepared to move to Israel if things go to shit in the US. 




 I have been hearing this definition of racism all over tumblr, Twitter, etc, as well as people adding that minorities can't be racist but can be prejucided. I have no idea where these definitions of racism are coming from and frankly they seem made up to add on to the victim complex that many people have. I myself am liberal and a feminist and all that shit, but this stuff really infuriates me, especially since if you challenge it you're automatically labeled as a racist. 




 Id like advice from current/past cs majors at UT. I'm going this fall but I'd like to get a head start by learning some things on my own. What are some things you wish you had already known how to do, at least somewhat, before you got to UT so you'd have a head start? Or, what did you already know how to do that gave you a head start? Any advice is much appreciated!
