 For instance if you live in a blue state would it even matter if you voted Republican?  





























 And if you could specify what political party you align with that'd be great. 



















 AR style rifles or "assault weapons" as they are commonly referred to are the main target of gun control. IMO this is the direct result of sensationalism on behalf of the media. I believe that anyone who thinks that AR style rifles are any worse than any other gun is uneducated on the matter and should have no say. I believe that anyone who uses an AR style rifle as an example of why we need gun control is either A) a politician using fear mongering tactics to further their cause, or B) a voter who is uneducated on the matter and should not have a say. I believe so because AR (Armalite NOT assault rifle) style rifles function exactly the same as any other semi automatic rifle. The difference is that AR style rifles have creature comforts that make them easier to carry around and use for long periods of time (like when you're hunting). CMV.

 Edit: shit this blew up. Also, TIL Redditors complain about things they can easily avoid. 

Edit 2: the amount of you that want condoms banned concerns me.

Edit 3: TIL Redditors hate toilet paper.

Edit 4: TIL Many redditors don't know the definition of the word "product"


Edit 5: OK, based on my inbox it seems like most people have decided on cigarettes, crocs, dildos, cell phones (I'm going to interpret that as smartphones), axe, and toilet paper.

Edit 6: Add soda (particularly coke), alcohol, and social networks to the list

 It seems like they'd understand their patient's mental problems more than a psychologist. 




 For the past few months I've had this thought/worry in my head. I know it's not true but I can't get it out of my head. It's this strange thing that I don't want in my head. If it were true then I would be shunned by society and I could be sent to prison. Again, I know it's not true but I still can't get it out of my head. 



Recently (past week) I haven't been able to stop thinking about it whereas I can usually push it to the back of my mind. It has caused me to become very depressed and stressed out. The thought that it could be true just pushes me over the edge. I don't know what to do. My research tells me that depression and anxiety can cause strange thoughts. If meds can get this thought out of my head and keep it from controlling my life then I want them. 














 I've ordered [this](http://www.cigarsinternational.com/samplers/58017/ci-taster-pack-mild-medium/#p-27068) yesterday.

I think I'm going to order [this](http://www.famous-smoke.com/montecristo+premium+cigar+assortment+4+pack+cigars/item+37285) if I end up enjoying cigars.

I'm pretty excited though and I really want to try one today. unfortunately we don't have any "real" smoke shops in my town. We pretty much have a few head shops disguised as smoke shops. Should I just wait or is there something I can pick up at a gas station that's worth trying? 




 **My 5 Questions:**

1. Did you feel in danger at any time?

5. Was it fun?

 Keep in mind that I'm not afraid to get dirty. I'm willing to work construction, garbage, etc. Basically I don't have a problem working a blue collar job if it means I can make some cash. 









 I was out of control. I had a two large big mac combo a day problem. One day as I was driving away from the drive thru with my first big mac of the day I started regretting my choices. I looked down at it and tossed it out the window right then and there, and I haven't touched a big mac since.

 Hey! So a few of my friends and I discovered an abandoned logging road awhile back. We drove pretty far down it until it became impassible via car. We scouted it on Google maps and it turns out it branches into a system of out of use logging roads, some of which lead to a coastal town that we all like visiting. Using Google's routing tool we discovered the whole trip would take ~8 hours on quads. But that figure could be off. We plan in borrowing a few ATV's, I believe the guy said they were 400cc Yamaha Utility quads.



What we plan on bringing:


Each Quad and rider will have:

*2 gallons of spare gas

*sleeping bag

*Camel Bak and spare water

*Hatchet+manual chainsaw

*Emergency water purification tablets and MREs

*Toilet paper

*Eating utensils

*Lighter

*clothes

*flair gun

*walkie talkie




Split between the three quads:

*tent

*gas powered chainsaw

*fire starters

*cooking stuff

*repair tools





Now I'm debating whether or not we need a collapsing toilet seat. We'll be about 20 miles from a major highway most of the time, but there will be logging camps nearby most of the time. Can you think of anything else we'll need. I think we might be able to do the trip in one day but I'm preparing as if we'll come across obstacles or won't be able to ride as fast as google suggests we can. It also depends on if there's anything we'll want to explore.  









 Edit: just realized that I fucked up the title 



















 There's obviously still a demand because people are buying foreign cars with M/T's. 




 Seeing as I won't be able to visit NYC until spring break at the earliest I'd like to know a bit more about the surrounding areas and whatnot.  





























 I think it may have been a reply to a Q on AskReddit. I also think it may have hit the front page. He later edited in a drawingof it that he made when he was a kid. I'm pretty sure he was located in Colorado at the time and his story was confirmed by another Redditor who saw the same thing and also lived in Colorado.  









 **My 5 Questions:**

1. Were you in the city or at the base when the battle happened?

2. Did any of you expect to see combat during that deployment? 

3. IMO One of the, for lack of a better word, funniest scenes in the movie was when the Delta operator went on his "safari" and got dinner. Did that kind of thing actually happen? 

4. What did you do after being discharged? 

5. If you could go back in time knowing what you know now, would you still join up?

Somebody could ask around in /r/military. 




 John Marston has a special ability called "Dead Eye". It allows him to seemingly slow time while still retaining normal mobility, target enemies, and increase general combat effectiveness. 


In GTA V each character has their own special ability.


Franklin can slow time while driving.


Trevor takes less damage while dealing more.


Michael can slow time while shooting.


All three are watered down variants of "Deadeye". But wait! The plot thickens! In RDR John Marston has three conflicting personalities. He is a family man that just wants to get back to his family. He wants to better his lifestyle at all costs. He is a rough around the edges cowboy. 


Franklin has inherited the dreamer personality. All he wants is to get out of the ghetto.


Michael represents the family man. His end game is to be closer to his family.


Trevor represents the rough around the edges cowboy. Sure, he's insane, but he also has a caring personality. 




 Seriously, I got a medium Pepsi from Arby's today and it was like a big gulp from 10 years ago. 




 Seriously. Especially in the college hill/friendly area the retaining walls turn so many intersections into dangerous, blind, corners. Anybody know how to get the ball rolling on a fix for this? In the meantime I might put up some of those domed security mirrors.

 Basically my choice at this point comes down to ROTC. How can I tell the quality of a program? 




 As a prospective cadet I'd like to know a few things. 


What is the PT schedule?  Sorry if this is obvious, but I couldn't find it kn the website. 



Does being a cadet prevent you from having a good time and partying?



Is the teacher/CO strict in comparison to other ROTC programs?  









 I'm looking for a solid college commuter. I've got a car, so it won't be my only mode of transportation. My commute is 4 miles in 25-30 mph residential neighborhoods, and 6 miles on a 45 mph freeway.





Here's what I'm looking at: the Ninja 300 (abs?), the Suzuki Boulevard S40, and the CBR250R, but I just read that they are coming out with a CBR300R, so I might wait for that. I'm also thinking about getting a used H-D Iron 883 sportster. Other suggestions are welcome. My budget is ~5500, although ideally I'm buying a nice used bike in the 3500-4500 range.

 We know from some nifty detective work by users on this subreddit that Brian will return. The question is, how? Stewie has destroyed his time travel tech and has no way to build a new time machine. However, we also know from S4E30 that they have time travel tech in the future, and that future stewie (stu) is in possession of this technology.



My theory is that the Griffin's will make a time capsule for their future selves. Stewie will leave a letter for Stu in the time capsule begging him to come back to the present and help save Brian. We will then have an episode from Stu's perspective as he reads the letter and travels back in time to save Brian. 




 A month or two ago I changed my Microsoft account email because I had lost access to the old email. Since then every time I log onto xbox.com it tells me something has gone wrong, and every time I try to go to the billing information part of my xbox I get an error code (I'll check to see what it is later) and then I can't change anything. Any idea what's wrong? I want to download some DLC's, but I can't until I add a credit card. 




 I know you guys are not lawyers but I thought I'd ask.



It seems like online bitcoin gambling is legal, or at least a grey area. Would the same apply to brick   mortar bitcoin gambling? Say you had a system where they sent you a bitcoin payment, and you then gave them an equivalent amount of chips. When it comes time to cash out, you send them a digital bitcoin payment. Since bitcoin is not considered legal tender (yet), would this get around gambling laws? It seems like it would because there is no exchange of cash between parties



Edit: US gambling laws.

 I occasionally attend confession. Not to right myself with a God, but to have a way to get stuff I feel guilty about off my chest. Many would say that by attending confession and reading the Bible I am a Catholic.  Basically where do we draw the line between subscribing to a religion and agnostics, and then agnostics and athiests? Can an athiest believe in any form of higher power (luck, superstition, etc) or would that make them an agnostic? 









 In the coming months should it still be treated as an investment or is it becoming a true currency? The reason I ask is because I was introduced to bitcoins when the silk road bust happened, and it has become a very intriguing investment option to me. 




 And do you believe that that's a good or bad thing? 




 You have to assume major candidates are vetted. If everything they've ever done, even their most illegal and perverse internet history shows up how will anyone ever be elected?

 Hey all. I have been looking at spec miatas on racing junk and I've found one I like, but I have a few questions. I presume, but I'd like confirmation,  that buying a ready to race spec miata with high miles and putting another motor in is cheaper than making a lower mile miata race ready, correct? I'm pretty heavy, 240 lbs, can I make weight in a 1.6 or should I try to find a 1.8?



Finally,  and this has nothing to do with those questions. Why are SM's with wins more expensive?  In a driver dependent format like SM the car's pedigree doesn't seem like it would matter. 




 I'm probably not using the correct term to describe them, but I have examples.

--

On an ask reddit thread a few days ago there was a guy who mentioned he's part of a growing group that has decided not to identify as any race. Regardless of their birth race they have decided to mark, or write in, "other" as their race on forms.

--

There was a guy on reddit a few days ago asking how to tell his girlfriend that he wouldn't be getting her an engagement ring because it's an outdated practice.

--

Theres also the people who have decided to give everything a PC name. For example instead of referring to a male as just a man they feel the need to call them a cisgendered man.

--

Finally there was the guy who decided Sir and Mam aren't PC enough and is trying to create a gender neutral version.

--

Now I get these are of varying levels of extremity but I'd like your opinion on these types of people. 




 It doesn't seem like a religious thing and there is no proof that fapping in moderation is harmful.  I don't get it.

 I made an Italian friend over the summer. He was by no means a smoker, but he would always have a cigarette in hand at parties. After I asked him about It he explained that in Europe, especially Italy   France,  smoking is much more accepted, and that many people there are social smokers. Why is it that in the US we have the mentality that you can either kill youself as a heavy smoker or you don't smoke at all, whereas occasional smoking is commonplace in Europe? 




 So I woke up a few days ago and my left foot hurt. The pain feels like soreness. It's now a few days later and my foot hurts when I walk. The pain is coming from the top of the foot a little ways behind the big toe. Any ideas as to what is going on? I'm 18, male, overweight but not to the point that I can't play football with my friends, not currently on any medication. 




 My dream for college has always been to attend a high caliber school, and (don't hate) join a fraternity. Due to certain circumstances I can't get into the types of schools I wan't to go to as a freshman. Is it possible to transfer into a school like USC after your freshman year? I can't do it after my sophomore year because I won't be able to join a frat. I know that the website says I "can" transfer on my timeline, but I would like to know if anyone ever gets accepted on that timeline?

 I'm looking to buy my first Evo!!!!!!!!!!! The guy wants 18k for it. I know I should be wary of mods, which this has, and it also has a new transfer case which makes me think it had the whine of death at some point. I'm not sure if that leaves lasting damage.

So I'm looking at an Evo viii/ix or a WRX right now. But I'm looking for alternatives because those are pushing it in terms of insurance ccosts. Any ideas? Must be fast, built post 2000, able to handle snow, and less than 14k. Manual transmission is a plus. It doesn't need to be a four door but I do need to be able to squeeze four people in. Also why do Evo IX's still cost 20k+

 I'm in the market for an '08+ WRX. I know I should look for salvage titles, and I assume if it has mods I should checkout the tranny, but what else? Is their a difference in performance between the hatch and the sedan? Finally will they be much cheaper when '14 rolls around? Because I'd love to get an STI, but I can't afford one at the moment.

 I'm an American and I'm planning on visiting Ireland soon. What should I do? What shouldn't I do? For instance my ancestors were Irish. Do Irish people get annoyed when we talk about that? Is there pub etiquette that we may not know about? etc. 




 Like what genre? 




 Mine are:

Hero of war - Rise Against

Where were you (when the world stopped turning) - Alan Jackson

Otherside - Macklemore (I'm not sure if this song is actually that sad. It might be because I was in a bad place because a close family member relapsed when I first heard it, and I associate it with that.)

There are a couple more I just can't think of them now. Will edit if I do. 




 Are you trying to maximize the human experience? Do you use them to study? Just curious. 




 A little background, I'm a senior in high school searching for work/paid internships over the summer. My high school diploma is coming with something that basically says I specialized in business   marketing while I was there. I'm not sure if other states do this, but here in Oregon it's called Career Aligned Mastery (CAM). For privacy reasons I will not put my resume up, but I have some questions.

Is it appropriate to list my tutor as a reference? If I'm applying for a summer job online can I say that I have a high school diploma? I have not graduated yet, but I will by the time I've started working there. Finally, do I mention the CAM or will they not care? 




 Context: you can get as much as you want, whenever you want, totally for free. BUT the drug has not been studied, so there is no way of knowing if it will screw you up in the long run. 

NZT-48 is the pill from the movie Limitless.

My answer: Yes I would. A drug that unlocks every scrap of information you have ever heard or seen in your life while simultaneously giving you limitless motivation is too good to pass up. 




 Did you notice any changes to your senses or your physical abilities? Do you have any stories that you feel like sharing? 




 It'll be primarily on flat, paved, bike paths. I'm looking at the mercier kilo TT and the Fuji track classic right now. I'd like to get a single speed for ease of use, but I'd consider geared bicycles. Fixies without a flip flop hub are out of the question. On both those bikes I would replace the handlebars, and put a second rear brake lever on the drop bar. Any other suggestions? My budget is $650. 




 Hey all! In preparation for college next year I've decided to start trying to live on less than $50.00 per week including food, transportation, and entertainment. Today I decided to spend a bit extra on lunch because I've started riding my bike instead of driving. The review will be broken into two parts: The angry whopper, and BK's new satisfries.

Angry Whopper: Initially I was going to get chicken strips, but when I saw the pic of the angry whopper I had to try it. It's your standard sized whopper with pepperjack, bacon, jalapenoes, and a spicy sauce. The picture made it seem like they would put french fries on the burger for you, however mine did not. I sat down in the BK and opened the box. The burger looked similar to the picture. It is pretty messy. It wasn't too spicy it just had enough kick to the point that you could feel it. all in all 7/10 (on the fast food scale).

Satisfries: (medium size) These were the reason I went to BK. I had been wanting to try them. They are crinkle cut, and healthier than the classic BK french fries. I didn't get ketchup so I just a them plain which was fine because they are decently salty. They're not crispy at all. I would compare them in terms of size and texture to steak fries. Despite the mixed reviews I enjoyed them. They have more of the soft potato filler stuff in them than your stereotypical fast food french fry. They tasted like the fries at 5 guys except less greasy. 8/10 just don't expect them to taste like BK's classic fries.
