 Fartney 2012 




 I watched the IGN review of Halo 4, and never have I ever seen such incredible amounts of ass kissing in my life. The reviewer was literally embarrassing to listen to because he acted like he was blown away and was about as bad at acting as the new Master Chief voice actor. I own Halo 4 and aside from graphics, the gameplay is identical to previous iterations. Nothing about it should appeal Halo fans who actually want the series to progress, because sadly, it has not. So, I ask you, do you think these reviewers get paid to say nice things?  




 We obviously know that our country is fucked and ran by a bunch of rich faggots. Our two party system is the biggest joke in the world and half our population stands by idly and bickers about Obama and Romney. I'm sick of just reading about how screwed up everything is, I'm ready to do something about it. What do we do? How do we give this country back to its people? It's obviously not gonna start at the ballot.  
























 I would hope everyone is aware of this website 














 Why don't they talk about the 3rd party candidates? They seem more preferable to me than Romney or Obama anyway. 

 




 It always seems like they form near Florida, respectively. But Y NO South Cali??? 




 Tonight I met someone who was beautiful, nice, had a good sense of humor and was just generally everything I was looking for. We then somehow got onto the topic of Religion and I expressed my faith in Jesus and she expressed that she is "Spiritual". It didn't end in argument, and it allowed me to share my testimony, etc. Fortunately, it didn't make things weird or anything. I would just like some advice from Christians if this would be wise to pursue if the possibility presented itself. I know what the answers are going to be, so please, help me to understand, because this person seems to be something special that doesn't come along very often. Thank you. 

EDIT: apparently she has a boyfriend. sweet. 









 I find if the kills in a multiplayer game get repetitive, the entire game gets old very fast. What do you guys think of the kills and rag doll thus far? Also, what kinds of things are deal breakers for you and a new game? 
























 With the advent of rag doll, and Euphoria physics used in games like GTA, and Backbreaker, why don't more games shy away from rehashed and reused death animations that make kills in games like Halo and CoD less satisfying and more repetitive? 

I play a shooter to have fun killing things, not see the same thing over and over again.  














 I've always loved the atmosphere Lovecraft creates with his description of entering tombs, down spiral stair cases with no light except a torch. Or the insanity that is instilled through the rising of Cthulu. Anything from his stories would be fantastic. Thank you :) 




 I'll start. 

I remember when the "Passion of the Christ" came out and hearing somebody say, "The Pope came forward today and has declared after viewing 'the Passion' that, 'It is, as it was' ". 

That pissed me off because, since when is the Pope the king of God?

Then I realized that a lot of the Catholics viewing this movie would have trusted the Pope's opinion. But that still doesn't make sense to me.  









 I visit, gmail; facebook; turntable.fm; ign; youtube; youjizz; and a few other lame sites. What are your most common? 
































































 just curious 









 After two months since the release of Counter Strike: Global Offensive on Xbox, there is still not a single patch or update that allows you to actually play with your friends. What the fuck is the point of buying the game!? Go fuck yourself Gabe.  









 Any ideas on how much the part and cost of labor would turn out to be? 
I live in PA if that matters. 









 Please be honest. I think some real life stories of healing, and other amazing experiences through God would bring great joy and increased faith to everyone here :)

EDIT: Thanks for all the stories and experiences, and I pray everyone has been strengthened in their faith through reading them. Keep em' coming! :D 




 A colossal planetary orb overlooks our home. Nearly at the climax of its Kiss with the rock we call Earth. Some of the most amazing shades of blue you'll ever see. Colors you don't find here. Colors artists attempt, and fail to replicate. It only peaks every 68 years, but you can always see it coming months in advance. A new star in the sky at first, then within half a year's time, the harvest moon dawns forth its peak. Some call it our planet's passing lover, some call it the thief, because it always drags our moon with it for a time before gravity can set itself right - which it always does. But when it does come, its always an exciting time here. The world seems to come together for nearly a year in the common endeavor to appreciate what some hold as God's passing eye. It pushes the rain away from certain areas, and you always know it's closest when the clouds gather and the water just won't stop falling. And then comes the twilit days and shadowless nights. By the time the sun hits noon, the sky is eclipsed, and the blue hues don't miss anything after sun down. It truly is an experience that all should share in at least one lifetime.

Sheel and I laid under the aquatic nightlight, atop our favorite get away spot overlooking our village - Of which was celebrating Peak Banquet. The festival lights gave illusion that the night's excitement was nearly at its apex, paralleling the sapphire that penetrated our night. I felt almost invigorated by the energy the blue bulb in the sky was giving off. And when we got away from all the noise, its song can be heard through energetic vibrations that hum only soft enough for those who listen closely - those who seek to hear. And as we laid there, holding hands, I could feel the vastness of the cosmic sphere reverberating through us both, nearly enhancing through our physical connection.

"They say it's getting closer, you know", Sheel gently let out. In my near hypnosis, I nearly missed what she'd said.

"Ah... You don't buy into that Collision Course fear do you?" I rattled off in nearly the same words I've heard from my parents time and time again. She paused for a long while, her eyes reflecting equally beautiful seas of blue back at the monster in the sky.

"I don't know...my father's been doing a lot of work at the observatory lately, and he says...something's changed." Her gaze never broke from the atmosphere, and I had no words to say. "He says at this rate, this might be the last cycle before...The Event. Silence filled the air as what she said began to pass over me. Fireworks could be seen popping and fading in sparkling reds and yellows near village square. The irony of it all nearly brought a smile to my face. We laid there quietly, looking directly at what some held in highest form of natural phenomenon and beauty, and by the same means, could very well bring about our end. But the fear, the fear had not over taken me. I knew I was exactly where I was suppose to be. Sheel grasped my hand even tighter, we looked into each others' eyes, and all I could hear was that gentle hum. 


































 here's a .gif  

EDIT: annnnd....it's gone! 




 She even munched Mila Kunis' rug pro bono

EDIT: pro boner  




 Failed it for the second time. Did 100 Questions a day for a month and a half - KAPLAN online resources.  Not sure how to approach it this time around. For those who passed, please explain to me the specific manner in which you went about studying so I can emulate that and also pass. Thanks :) also pray for me if you could.  




 took it today 8/30/12  0800-1245

-Got 245 Questions
-Finished the test on a Multiple Answer Question (not sure if I got it right, also not sure if that's a positive sign)
-got quite a few multiple answer questions, probably around 10-15 (still not sure if thats a good thing, but i hear those are higher end questions)
-only got 3 dosage calc out of 245 (which I hear the less dosage calc, the better)

Overall the test was really hard, but i feel i knew more than I did the first time (still not much lol). Was just looking for thoughts, ideas and support. :)

Thanks! 









 Sweden 





























 I lopped off my dick with less-than-average sharp scissors.

And then I buried my sleeping 3 day old infant underground. I doubt she's woken up yet. 

EDIT: don't tell mom 




 All I see on Reddit is negative statements about Romney, which I understand. But, why nothing about Obama? Why does this site lean so far left that it seems almost to refuse to give any sort of basic criticism to our current president? You would think, even by chance, that at least a few articles would make it to the front page once and a while. Am I the only one who notices this bias?... 

EDIT: Since I have you all here, I will now proceed to revealing that Satan runs this world, and dominates both the democratic and republican parties you all hold so dear. He is currently perverting the Jewish Zionists to use their endless stream of finances to rule everything you thought was for you: MEDIA, MILITARY, BANKS, and of course POLITICS. 

OBAMA is a shill, no different than BUSH and you all will live to see World War III. 9/11 was an inside job. Get off your knees and fight back 

RON PAUL 2012 - or Gary Johnson if we have to...sigh

 lately, every game i play i feel bored and as if i've played it already. I was hoping /r/gaming could point me in the direction of a game they've loved oh so much, but maybe not many people played it. Something different, like Shadow of the Colossus. Thanks! 




 Link; Cost?

 I'm just curious to see the differences between history books written at earlier times in the previous century. Thank you Reddit! 




 What if Ron Paul doesn't win the nomination/presidency? Do we just wait for all the DoomPaul memes to come true and embrace the end of the world or...? What's the plan? Because I don't see much hope without his truth and honesty in office.  
























 The Year: 2064

Grandpa walks into the living room to see his 6 year old grandson is laughing, laying prone in front of some sort of handheld gaming device while his
eyes are in REM. (Rapid Eye Movement)

"Hey buddy whaddya playin there?", asks grandpa looking at his grandson in confusion


Grandson quickly comes out of his REM and looks at his grandpa cheerfully and replies, "My Nintendo Synfesis Gwandpa!" With a lisp :) (Nintendo Synthesis)


Grandpa's confusion quickly subsides with a smile of relief and replies, "ohhh, Nintendo? Shoot, I used to have a 
Game Boy back in the day. Played the heck outta that thing"


"Grandpaaaa, dis isn't da same as a silwy Game Boyy", Grandson says laughingly annoyed.


"Whaddya talkin' abouuut? Lemme see that thing", retorts grandpa with confidence.


"We can pway together!" Excitedly replies grandson. Grandson proceeds to hand grandpa another one of the devices.
The device is merely a 3x3in rectangular chrome device with a rounded spherical bottom. Similar to a three dimensional ellipse 
divided in half with central a flat surface. 

Grandpa examines it oddly, looking on all sides, "Where's the D-Pad?...How do I turn this thing on?"


Giggling, grandson exclaims, "You just have to holwd it with boff hands gwandpaaa"


"Oh, okay", grandpa says as he places both hands on the device, "What're we even 'playing' anyway?"


"Caww of Duty: Stormfront!", excitedly replies grandson as he quickly gets comfortable and places both hands on the device,
at which point you begin to hear a low binaural beat begin to build within the system and slowly growing louder.


"Well CoD's kinda gay -- but What the heck is that sound?", asks grandpa in confusion.


"It's startin' up Gwandpa", replies grandson with a big innocent smile.


As the noise begins to grow grandpa's mind begins to wonder into nostalgic memories, "Oh...well you know when I was your age,
I would play Pokemon none stop. I swear, I had the best line-up ever. My Dragonite was level 100 -- " Suddenly,
within the blink of an eye grandpa is transported to a drop ship transport about to land in the middle of a barren planet war zone. He looks around 
in frantic fear and confusion, seeing he is surrounded by a dozen other future soldiers preparing to fight. Everyone is strapped into their seats with
metal chest harnesses, wearing futuristic black and grey military protective equipment and wielding heavy assault rifles. The ship is severely turbulent 
as it draws nearer to the surface of the battle. "What the hell is happening!? Where am I?!!!", cries Grandpa
to all of the nameless soldiers he is seated next to. All of which seem have their wits about them.


"Private! Get your shit together! Now is not the time to lose it!", commands what appears to be the Sergent of the ship's unit.


Grandpa is shocked in fear facing the Sergent, who returns his body to the upright position of his harnessed seat while someone next to grandpa gestures
the Catholic cross across their chest as they kiss their Christian pendant. Grandson then reveals his smiling face and waves "Hi, gwandpaaa!", says grandson
with cheer.


"Oh my God! What the hell is happeningggg!!!??" screams grandpa.


"We got to take the Cwompound, gwandpa" replies grandson as he rocks his head from side to side joyfully.


"What!!? What the hell are you talking about? What is this!!?, exclaims grandpa in utter fear and calamity.


"Just fowwow me grandpa!" laughs grandson as the ship comes to a sudden halt. 


"OhGodFUCK! What is hap-!" grandpa is screaming as The harnesses suddenly rise, and the side hatch of this ship immediately burst open. The noise quickly grows ten-fold, with near by explosions and dust flying so thick that its barely visible to see more than 20 feet in front of oneself.

"Alright Men! Into eternity we fly!" shouts the Sergent as he throws his hand forward giving the command to charge. Large amounts of similar ships can be 
seen landing, and leaving near their drop zone.The terrain is virtually flat as the dust bowl continues to fog any view besides what lies ahead.
 Hundreds of soldiers are running into the clouds of fog. 
Many of which are being mowed down by continued chain
gun fire and blown to pieces by explosions and artillery. 

Grandpa, standing in the haul doorway of the drop ship stares in disbelief at what he is witnessing when suddenly he feels quick jab to his
right leg and a grab
at his hand from grandson exclaiming, "Come on gwandpa, follow meeee". Grandson begins to run haphazardly into the fray of smoke.

"Wait! NO!" Grandpa yells as he suddenly becomes aware of his grandson sprinting into a firefight. Grandpa proceeds to sprint after him. As he runs blindly in grandson's last known direction,
all he can see is random soldiers faces gliding with him in his run as well as the amount of vigor and strength he now has that was not previously existent in his normal body's elder state. 
This revelation is quickly forgotten as nearly as soon as he sees more soldiers passing by him in the haze, they are quickly swept down by bursts and flashes of light and blasts from
whistling bombs from above. Dirt and debris began to soil grandpa's clothing.
A sudden cut back to grandpa and grandson in the living room shows both of them experiencing REM with grandpa's mouth wide open making odd screaming noises and grandson smiling and giggling.
Cut back to the battlefield, the only usable cover are large boulders that randomly appear through the haze. A large explosion in the distance knocks grandpa down to the ground, the heat from the blast causes his face
to be flushed in even more sweat. Grandpa scrambles on all fours to the nearest boulder that is nearly 12ft high and sizable enough
to cover four men. Large numbers of other soldiers continue to pass by on both sides. Grandpa presses his body tightly against the boulder next to soldiers of which are poised to return fire with no direct leader.
On grandpa's side is a medic attempting to revive an unconscious soldier with CPR and various medicinal shot administrations that only require the grasp of a trigger to instill into the skin. This is to no avail.

"God damn it, wake up!" Screams the medic to the dead soldier, of whom has a severe burns and lacerations to the entire front of the body.

The soldier on grandpa's other side nearest the edge of cover pops out and shoots blindly into the fog screaming, "Motherfuckerrrrsss!".
A stray bullet flies in and goes directly between the soldiers neck and clavicle. He collapses in front of grandpa grasping his neck as blood begins to spray out of his artery
with each heart beat. Grandpa's face is stricken with shock as he lets out a girlish screech.

 



























































 So i failed my nclex on 7/2/12 in the state of Pennsylvania. I went to the PA dept of state to reapply for the ATT and it said they "You already have a license of this type". And I wasn't sure if I have to wait a period of time before even apply again. They didn't make the whole 45-90 waiting period very clear. Can someone give me a clear explanation on the process I should go through? thanks :)

EDIT: I called. They said if you do a re-exam you need to send in a physical paper application. False alarm, I still failed... :/ 




 So i found out i failed the NCLEX which is the boards or test you need to pass to become a nurse. It sucks, but its obviously not the end of the world. The most frustrating issue was when i broke the news to my father, he was infuriated and continued to make a bunch of outlandish claims like, "things are gonna be changing around here!" and "You can get your own ride down to Harrisburg next time!" (the place of the test) and "This is bullshit!" - as if my failure is more of a detriment to him than it is me. He's not a christian if that's important, and I hate having issues with my dad. He's always been kind of a douche and often makes me feel like an idiot without considering my side of the story. I wanna tell him off but I also want to respect my parents and unfortunately, I still live under his roof until i can pass this stupid test and get a job. Basically, I would really appreciate prayer for passing the NCLEX test and my relationship with my father. Any advice would be cool too. Thanks.   




 So I took it yesterday, felt like I did horrible. And I mean horrible. Like, I didn't know anything. 230 questions later I was done. I got online the next day and some people said there's a trick you can do where if you try to register again on Pearson-Vue, if you passed, it won't let you go to the credit card screen. Unfortunately, it allowed me to make it to that screen and I feel like that has all but solidified my failure. Which, in turn, makes me feel like a sack of shite. Mainly because, I'll somehow, have to figure out how to change my study habits to pass next time. Which honestly, studying is the bane of my existence. Is there truth to the whole Pearson trick? Encouragement would be nice too ;P

 Not sure why /r/atheism hates christians so much. Sure, there can be some seriously ignorant followers who piss you off to the fullest extent, but not all christians are advocates of The Crusades. Not all christians molest children and try to tell you what to do. The message promoted by Jesus in the Gospels of the New Testament was that of peace, love and sacrifice. A lot of christians hold true to that and are great members of the community, helping the poor and needy. I know people like the Westboro baptist church are nuts, and a lot of other christians realize it as well. My biggest confusion with /r/atheism is, what's being accomplished by the top upvoted item being Jesus having sex with a goat? Your subreddit is flooded with this stuff. How is that evidence of people who claim to be critical thinkers, and well educated? Most of the time, rather than a legitimate debate, your subreddit is filled with hate. At times I wish the sub was renamed '/r/trolls'. It's not serving anyone. I suggest we take a step back and consider our actions.

1757- Colonial Scrip Issued in US

Debt free, fiat currency was printed in the public interest. As Benjamin Franklin said,

In the colonies we issue our own money. It is called colonial scrip. We issue it in proper proportion to the demands of trade and industry to make the products pass easily from the producers to the consumers. In this manner, creating for ourselves our own paper money, we control its purchasing power and we have no interest to pay no one.

1907- Banking Panic of 1907

The New York Stock Exchange dropped dramatically as everyone tried to get their money out of the banks at the same time across the nation. This banking panic spurred debate for banking reform. JP Morgan and others gathered to create an image of concern and stability in the face of the panic, which eventually led to the formation of the Federal Reserve. The founders of the Federal Reserve pretended like the bankers were opposed to the idea of its formation in order to mislead the public into believing that the Federal Reserve would help to regulate bankers when in fact it really gave even more power to private bankers, but in a less transparent way.

1921-1929  The Roaring 20s  The Federal Reserve Floods the Economy with Cash and Credit

1929  Federal Reserve Contracts the Money Supply

In 1929, the Federal Reserve began to pull money out of circulation as loans were paid back. They created a bust which was inevitable after issuing so much credit in the years before. The Federal Reserves actions triggered the banking crisis, which led to the Great Depression.

 A lot of crazy youtube sources keep predicting a nuclear and/or biological attack during the 2012 Olympic Games in London. Similar to the signs that pointed towards 9/11 occurring. All for the purpose of increased fear and furthered security to unite the world under one totalitarian big brother governing body. Has anyone else heard this? Please, I'm not trying to be crazy with this. I just want to hear peoples' thoughts on this that may have some sort of related information.

 I know this is a safe-haven for trolls, but please, no creepy pasta. I'm genuinely interested in real encounters and experiences.  
























 I'm talking about the weirdos and the thespians alike. What's your personal view of someone who openly sings at any given time, without prompt? Even the black dudes who sing to themselves loud as they walk by with their iPhones blaring.  









 So many people use old testament verses to put down the bible and it's meaning. I personally feel a lot of the crazier stuff of the old testament like Exodus 21 is specifically addressed to the Hebrews of that time and shouldn't be pulled out of context to shut down any biblical argument. What do you think?

EDIT: I don't know, the one thing I've seen for sure is that people with different views need to meet somewhere more personal than the internet. Not to be rude, but this Christianity vs Atheist is the biggest circlejerk on Reddit 









 I just saw the movie, Prometheus, and even though I can see the events clearly occur before the Alien movie timeline; I'm confused how the movie directly ties in as a prequel. I felt like there were quite a few script holes and plot decisions that didn't make sense. I can't think of many off the top of my head, but the movie left me a bit jaded. 

Any ideas my Reddit friends? 




 My grandmother has cancer that has metastasized (spread) all through her body including her pancreas, liver, spleen, and spinal cord. She is 87 y.o. Her husband, my grandfather, died of cancer 4 years prior and, even though she is cheerful, has never been in good health since. The clear prognosis (likelihood of the disease progression) is terminal (death). Unfortunately, even with that most definite outcome, the physicians (doctors) insist on continuing to perform procedures; of which will be billed to her insurance company.

She suffers from severe back pain, due to the cancer's spinal cord involvement, and the physicians say they want to perform a biopsy (take out a piece of the cancer for examination) to determine the best method of pain control for her palliative care (care for someone who's dying). I, personally, have never heard of a cancer biopsy being necessary to determine specific treatment for pain. Especially palliative. 

I know I probably just seem angry and accusative, but I would like my grandmother to spend as much time at home with her family as possible before she passes. I don't want to openly know that the doctors and hospital are just trying to gain a profit from her suffering. 

If anyone with personal experience, like someone who encountered a similar situation or someone in the medical field, could shed some light on this it would be much appreciated.

PS - I'm not blood related if anyone wanted to tell me to get early screening etc. :) 



















 I see Michael Ironside (voice of Sam Fisher) is being replaced by a different actor in Splinter Cell: Blacklist. What I don't understand is, if the events takes place after Conviction (where Sam Fisher already seemed like he was getting older), why would they replace him with a young actor with a young voice and it even appears Sam's movement is that of young stud. Why wouldn't they just do a prequel or something, when Sam was just starting to kick ass or something. I donno, I just don't like the taste this is putting in my mouth.  




 I feel like no one knows what's going on. And don't give me bullshit. You can't tell me that our 21st century minds have any iota of a clue to what the fuck all "THIS" is (the universe etc). All that has come to be is new theories, nothing proven. Life after death is NOT proven or disproven. Although, I've heard a ton more stories of near death/ out of body experiences where people say they've seen something (white light, God, whatever). I mean, holy shit, how can one be so arrogant as to utterly deny something that they have no possible way of understanding. Science is great, and has helped mankind tremendously, but to say it negates a spiritual perspective is outright stupid.

If you believe in atheism so much, why do you come to this subreddit just to be reassured that what you believe is right? Your actions are no different than the religious you shoot down (Culminating in the church of atheism).  Also, its become almost an unsaid duty of atheists to put down religion (that just seems low and also pointless). If what you believe is what you believe and that's the end of it, the need for a community to support your belief is erroneous.

Atheism doesn't help anyone either. At least religion or some sort of discipline gives people hope in something more. All atheism does is spread the word of nothingness and self-service and usually just an underlying way of expressing disgust with religion.

There's also this association with being an atheist and being educated. That's just an outright lie because, education (math, science, history etc) and personal beliefs are almost mutually exclusive and being atheist does not necessitate a higher IQ in any sense. 

Take a step back and compare yourself to anyone you know. Your understanding of this world and what's beyond holds no stronger basis than your neighbor. Before you go out of your way to explain to people the lack of an existence of a god/gods, maybe you should step out of your comfort zones and do some searching yourself. Even if that searching is within.

tl;dr - /r/atheism = /r/circlejerk

PS - all those pictures people post of "famous" atheists and their quotes - I've never seen a single one of them smiling 8( 



















 For a male just looking to keep his face clean without using bar soap. 

What I've been doing is using dial soap in the shower to clean off the grease and then a moisturizer on my face to keep it from drying out. 

I just need something that will clean and moisturize without making me break out.
