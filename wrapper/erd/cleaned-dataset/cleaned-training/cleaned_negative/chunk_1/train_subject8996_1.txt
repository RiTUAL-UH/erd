 Yes he does. The astronomical odds are getting better every day.  



















 I would hope it's a healthy stool with brown coloration.  




 Just wait until Hillary's people begin the attacks. 














 like no other old white male  




 He is and he will. It comes with the territory.  



















 We were pragmatic with favoring Obama over Kucinich. No mas!  




 I hope they can get something better than a potato to record in the future, but still happy to hear him  




 awesome, thank you 




 it's very choppy, is there something better by chance? 




 Love it. I hope we see this crows get bigger and bigger. 




 haters gonna hate, ain'ters gonna ain't 









 I am out of shape and not buff like Ken. If i had him flattened out with both arms around his neck I would have finished him no doubt. I don't care if Ken is over the hill. There is no way he shouldn't have finished that in that position. I don't buy it. 




 what about old man strength? and the massive  of cycle of steroids Ken just did?  




 The ease with which Kimbo got up should be convincing enough if Ken's inability to finish was not.  




 worse! it was fixed 




 because ken wasn't actually trying to submit him 




 because it was 




 I think so. 




 Ken lost that on purpose! **FIX** 




 TRT clinic. 




 Ken is the most fake person in MMA. Kimbo can't even walk, but I am rooting for him to KO Ken.  









 I honestly think Jimmy might take the job and never give it back, just like Tom did.  









 for someone who weighs that much? it's short 




 that's essentially the same question 
 




 A very mediocre card.  




 are you serious? is that why the US wins or is at the top of the medal count every year? you want a list or something?  




 i don't remember all of those qb's being that good back then, but then again i was a kid 




 they actually find the guys they are to groom to be Olympians at much younger ages than that

you're right, we do have to incentivize it, both monetarily and with shine 




 Could crossfit maybe make an impact?  




 that sounds about right 




 For the masses, yes it kind of does.  




 I think you have identified the cause of the problem. 




 Ilya is only 5'9. 




 and what happens when all of these guys get old and retire and none of them are around in 2020? :'( 

we can't all be andrew luck fans, can we? 




 Other countries have lifters who are in the olympics at 19 or 20, and our lifters aren't lifting anywhere in the same universe as them. Why are these tiny nobody countries, no offense  I just mean in terms of population and work presence, putting elite lifters up there and we're not? Even North Korea is kicking our butts. North Korea! The country we make fun of all the time and is starving to death. 




 The rest of the world plays basketball too, right?  




 *was 

I see a lot of black and green lately 









 I got to see Moon towards the end of his career. He was special. 









 We have our three major sports and hockey as a 4th major regional sport. Soccer isn't on the radar. We did just beat Germany though, so the future is bright.  




 thanks, he's been right about so much! 




 ah, thanks 




 It bothers me that the Chinese dominate. I respect their athletes, but I wish we'd value weight lifting.  




 I bet he has had kids play in the NBA and those kids' households looked like [this](http://images.static-bluray.com/reviews/303_1.jpg) 




 You're rihgt, there could have been many different motives, but cccam's razor = hate crime 




 how is it unethical? it was a hate crime, it is relevant  




 Because America is run by corporations and special interests like the NRA (national rifle assocation). They own about 95% of all politicians. They don't serve the interests of the citizenry. Also, our values are defunct. We have mass shootings all the time, but people value extreme gun rights more than they do people's lives. This is why it's a lot easier to purchase a gun than it is to vote. 




 right now 




 about what? like which particular bit of his are you referring to? i'm genuinely curious  




 i'm not caught up on the american lifting scene, hence my question 




 Not sarcasm. We do though if you consider all the sports.  




 u want sugar coating?  




 How is it disgusting? Isn't that exactly what happened? 
 




 who? 




 Thanks. So, we have pretty much nothing? :( 




 what about the women? anyone there worth keeping an eye on?  









 P. Manning 39

Brady 38 ^(start of season)

 Would we not be hearing about how everyone is violating her? So, why does it seem that nobody realizes James  is being violated?  












































 Mayweather has already defeated Cotto, Alvarez, and Pacquiao. Amir Khan appears beneath his level. 

Why not put Golovkin in front of Mayweather and watch what he can do? Beating an undefeated, soon to be 20 knockouts in a row, and larger fighter would be the most difficult challenge of his apparent options, and if he wins, it would solidify his position as TBE. 

**Money** vs **GGG** 
























 HBO does with boxing. It gives more information to the viewer and improves the viewing experience.  The UFC added vegas odds, so why not make this change?  














 My school offered an unsubsidized loan that covers only half of my tuition. I think I have reached the 57.5k total limit. I have to find the rest of the tuition, a few thousand in nursing school fees, books, etc. I'm male. I have a previous bachelors degree in a social science. 90% of the 57.5k is from nursing school. A $10-15/hr job probably won't cut it.  I could use some realistic ideas. Nothing illegal. 






























































































 Is it some biological or psychological mechanism? Do people just want to be with themselves? What's going on?  












































 Fastest 40? Most bench press reps? Best vertical? Best performance at position drills. Etc. 














 Great engines, horrible name. I get it, they are economical and they give a boost, but could Ford not come up with a more attractive name for their turbocharged engines? "Eco" sounds weak and un-American.  

















































 The Lakers 2015 first round pick of course.  Top 5 protected in 2015, top 3 protected in 2016/7, unprotected in 2018.

Maybe throw in the Suns 2015 first round pick? 


Would the sixers be interested in Goran Dragic and or Gerald Green?  














 Assuming Jose is still the Champ at the time. Would this date be perfect?
