 Im not a fan of the "waves of zombies from generator being on" but i can see it attracting ones that are already nearby due to noise.
Edit: i would also like to add I love the idea of the higher number of people required for progression. A person will always be able to find a group. 




 Lolwut  




 Okay i see your point. The only problem for me is if i miss that first shot, im toast. 




 Often in a group ill choose the sks, because normally someone else has long range, but what would you pick if you were alone? 




 My goal of this  post is to always have a definitive choice when it comes to these guns. So could you please tell me why the mosin over the sks. 




 A lot of times thats what i think, but the fact that the mosin is always a one hit kill makes me torn between the two. 




 Its most likely that same part, but for the Remington 870
 




 Epoch. Best version of dayz out there. 




 I get that, and there are quite the number
Of troll fresh spawns. I wish there was a way to make this work regardless. 




 Alright, i see where you're coming from. Im just very tired of spawning in, walking for a minute and a half just to get offed by a guy with a mosin on some roof 




 Just no? No constructive criticism?
