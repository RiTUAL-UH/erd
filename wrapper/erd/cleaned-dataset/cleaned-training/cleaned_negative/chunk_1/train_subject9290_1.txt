 Some "normal" protagonists have negative qualities that make them more foolish than "normal". Which protagonists do you think are "perfectly normal"? 




 [Ri Akitoshi](http://myanimelist.net/character/68553/Akitoshi_Ri) in Area no Kishi is Korean. (Ri is the Japanese pronunciation of Lee.)

Kim Daesun, who appeared as an opposing player for Tsujido Academy, is also Korean. His name less Japanized than Ri's, although both live in Japan. 




 Have you disliked an adaptation for diverging from the original? Have you ever thought that a significant change from the original made an adaptation better?

 Do you tend to like anime based on likable characters? A good message about life? Great animation quality? Enjoyability? Or something else?
