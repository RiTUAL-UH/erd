 Still, I can't help wondering if the puritanism found in some places in the Pali Canon is an historical artifact, resulting from a general disparagement of the physical body that seems to have become common in India and elsewhere[...] such attitudes were apparently part of the cultural milleu the Buddha was raised in. Or did they arise afterward, and were inserted into the Canon later?

Whether or not such metaphysical considerations were a factor, other, more basic issues must have been important. Some of them are obvious and have already been mentioned. Monastic sexual activity would be a distraction to say the least, and expend a lot of energy that would be better used in other ways. Think of how much time and effort sexual affairs and liaisons can involve, even when they are not secretive. Add to that all the tensions and jealousies that would be created within the Sangha.

Already it becomes apparent that having a more relaxed attitude toward sex would be fatal to the spiritual focus of the community. However, at least two other concerns must also have weighed heavily.

We tend to forget that until the 1960s there was really no reliable contraception. Since Buddhism prohibited abortion and infanticide, sex meant babies, and all the work of caring for them and raising themespecially the unremitting daily task of providing enough food, which is incompatible with a mendicant life. The consequences of this can be seen in the cautionary tale of Japanese Buddhism. Japanese culture has always viewed our natural urges as...well, natural. That very much includes the sexual urge, and many if not most temple monks had common-law wives and children before they were legally permitted to marry after the Meji Restoration. The task of providing for them eventually transformed the temple into a family business, with the oldest son expected to become a priest to keep that temple business in the family, regardless of whether he had any religious inclinations. As a result, Japanese Buddhism today is a thriving (and lucrative) industry focusing on funerals and memorial services, and not much else.

One more factor may have been the most important of all. Buddhist monastics are traditionally dependent on lay support. This means that the Sangha must be very sensitive to the expectations of their supporters. For example, Chinese monks and nuns became vegetarian not because their vows required it but because the laity began to expect it. Also, needless to say, it wouldn't do to have monks seducing their supporters' daughters (or sons). Moreover, laymen and women would not look kindly upon sharing their hard-earned food and other resources with renunciants who, instead of devoting themselves to their spiritual practice, spend time dallying with lovers.  Even today, when monks in southeast Asian countries like Thailand are discovered with girlfriends, it's sometimes the local lay community that takes the initiative in forcibly disrobing them.

To sum up, there are many strong reasons for the Buddhist Sangha to be strictly celibate. Which of these were the important factors? Early Buddhist texts do not help us decide among them, but my guess is that all of them were.

How does this shed light upon our situation today? If it is more or less inclusive, there are major implications for Western Buddhism, because few if any of those reasons for celibacy are valid for lay practitioners today.

Yes, there are still times (periods of intensive practice) and places (within practice communities) when sexual abstention is obviously wise to observe. Few Western Buddhists, however, still look upon nature, women, and sex as impure entanglements to be avoided. Most of us don't have to worry about what our lay supporters think, because we don't have any, at least not in the traditional sense. Today we have access to effective means of birth-control, so babies usually aren't an issue unless and until we want them to be. A new category of Buddhist has become common in the West: less than monastic in lifestyle (hence not subject to Sangha vows or regulations) but also more devoted to practice than laity have usually been.[...]

So...does that mean we can breathe more easily now, as we accept and enjoy the new sexual freedoms? Not quite yet. There is another aspect of sexual relationships that we need to be aware of, and it's one that is not usually acknowledged.[...]

Our own cultural perspective should not be taken for granted, as if it provided some universal standard. Present Western attitudes are historically conditioned too, in this case by a myth about romantic love that evolved in late medieval Europe[...]

Although some of the emphasis has shifted from finding the right spouse to finding the right sexual partner, there is still the same expectation of personal fulfillment whether through romance or sexual intimacy. Buddhism questions that conscious or unconscious expectation, just as it challenges other myths that predispose us to seek happinessthe end of *dukkha*in an unskillful way.

Sexual intimacy is a source of pleasure and gratification, and a very nice one it can be; it can also help create and sustain deeper, more meaningful relationships. Nevertheless, the sex drive is basically biological. Sex is an appetite. We do not use our sexual organs; they use us. That is why there is ultimately something delusive about the myths of romantic love and sexual fulfillment. Sex is nature's way, and marriage is society's way, to reproduce the species. Genuine happinessthat is, the end of *dukkha* for any of the parties involved has little if anything to do with it.

 **The Method of Discourse**


We often find references to four stages in which the Buddha would initiate and conclude a discourse. The first stage is represented as "pointing out" (*sandasseti*), that is, indicating the problem. If it was in reference to an individual, the Buddha would explain that person's situation. If it concerned an event, thing, or phenomenon, the Buddha would attempt to create some "agitation" (*samuttejeti*) by emphasizing the non-substantiality of the individual, event, thing, or phenomenon. This is the process of deconstruction, intended to avoid any ontological commitment. If the discourse is concluded at this point, the person to whom it is addressed will be left in a state of anxiety. During the third stage, the agitation is immediately appeased (*sampahaseti*) by pointing to a way out of the problem. This is the process of reconstruction or redefinition, which is achieved through the positive doctrine of dependent arising explaining the subject, the object, and morality and freedom. In doing so, the Buddha recognized the capacity of language to communicate the content of human experience, whether that relates to facts or values. In the final stage, the Buddha makes no effort to convert the hearer to his way of thinking, for the hearer tends to accept his explanation without much ado (*samadpesi*).

The discourse (*dhamma*) formulated in terms of language thus becomes the means of communication. Communication, not only among those who speak different languages but also among those who speak the same language, becomes impossible if one adopts either of the approaches toward language criticized by the Buddha, namely, strict adherence or transgression. The first would imply that each conception utilized in language has its incorruptible object (ontological commitment) unavailable to human experience, while the second would imply that human experience is incommunicable through language (that is, linguistic transcendence). The Buddha seems to have realized that the former is more perverse that the latter. His method of communication therefore deals first with the problem of ontological commitment and then with linguistic transcendence. 


This is an extremely significant method of communication and conversion, based on the Buddha's understanding of human psychology. His contemporaries, who failed to understand the psychological significance of this method of discourse, saw him as a person possessed of the magical power of conversion (*vaan my*). Yet there was no magic or mystery involved. All that the Buddha did was carefully observe the intellectual maturity and psychological state of each person and provide a discourse that would produce beneficial consequences for him. The Chinese version of the Agama passage that refers to the four stages rightly characterizes them as the Buddha's "skill in means".

"Skill in means" does not imply converting someone by discoursing on something that is obviously false. In fact, the two stages of causing agitation (*samuttejana*) and appeasement (*sampahasana*) correspond, respectively, to deconstruction of solidified conceptions through analysis (*vibhga*), which is the function of the doctrine of non-substantiality (*anatta*), and reconstruction of the same conception by the method of explanation (*vykaraa*), which is achieved through the principle of dependence (*paticcasmuppda*). Both these processes allow for a great degree of flexibility and are intended to eliminate both absolutism and nihilism.

 The preparation for the bodhisattva path is the unification of body and mind: the body works for the mind and the mind works for the body. The hinayana shamaha and vipashyna practices make the mind precise, tanquil and smooth in the positive sense - precisely being there, rather than dreaming or sleeping or hazily perceiving. We can make a cup of tea properly, because the body and mind are synchronized.

Then we are ready to leap on to the bodhisattva path, to open to the joy of working with sentient beings, including oneself. The bodhisattva makes friends with himself as well as with others. There are no mysterious, dark corners left of which to be suspicious; no surprises can occur to destroy the bodhisattva's spiritual intelligence, his dignity and heroism. This is the first step, the first *bhumi* or spiritual level.

The word 'bhumi' in Sanskrit, or the word *sa* in Tibetan, means 'earth' or 'level' or 'ground', the ground where you can relate with yourself and others. There is no mystification, no confusion; it is obviously solid earth. In other words, it is the equivalent of the basic sanity, fundamentally being *there*. Since the bodhisattva knows his body and his mind and how to relate with the two, the whole process becomes 'skillful means' because of such transcendental security. Which is more like being *in* security rather than being secured, rather than watching yourself to make sure everything is okay. That fundamental security comes from realizing that you have broken through something. You reflect back and realize that you used to be extraordinarily paranoid and neurotic, watching each step you made, thinking you might lose your sanity, that situations were always threatening in some way. Now you are free of all those fears and preconceptions. You discover that you have something to give rather than having to demand from others, having to grasp all the time. For the first time, you are a rich person, you contain basic sanity. You have something to offer, you are able to work with your fellow sentient beings, you do not have to reassure yourself anymore. Reassurance implies a mentality of povertyyou are checking yourself, 'Do I have it? How could I do it?' But the bodhisattva's delight in his richness is based upon experience rather than theory or wishful thinking. It is *so*, directly, fundamentally. He is fundamentally right and so can delight in generosity.

 Furthermore, if we cling to our being Christians, Jews, atheists or Buddhists, we 
will always be worried about what people may think of Jesus and the Christians, of Jews, 
of atheists, or of Buddha and the Buddhistsand when those with whom we identify are 
insulted, we will get offended and suffer, and we might even be willing to fight and thus 
run the risk of suffering blows, pain, bruises, wounds and even death (or to cause any of 
these damages to our opponent). However, if we defeat our adversary we will remain 
dissatisfied as well, since we will never be able to convince him that we are right, and he 
will keep on having a negative opinion of Christians, Jews, atheists or Buddhists. This 
dynamic is at the root of conflicts between groups, and in particular of warswhich, 
given the characteristics and number of present weapons, in the best of cases produce a 
drastic acceleration of the process of self destruction of humanity and, in the worst of 
cases, might cause the immediate destruction of life on our planet. Thus Krishnamurti 
was right when he asserted that, so long as we are this or that (which, as will be shown in 
the next chapter, in the context of this book means so long as we delusorily value our 
being this or that), we are responsible for wars and for confrontations between groups, 
with all their negative consequenceswhich nowadays may even involve global 
destruction.

      Memory is a prism through which 

     yesterdays's light is passed;

     Split into a rainbow of moments 

     each colored more dimly than the last. 

     How will today's light look tomorrow 

     and - how would tomorrow's look today? 

     Would the filter of time be as brutal

     if that prism were two-way?

 I asked this question a while back in /r/AskLiteraryStudies - [link](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskLiteraryStudies/comments/1l83m6/portrayals_of_healthy_sexual_relationships/) . Can anyone think of examples in literature in which a long-term sexual-relationship is depicted as happy, healthy and non-neurotic? 





































































 I've realised that I've been practising the karuna-bhavana instead of the metta-bhavana. At the Triratna centre that I go to they teach the metta-bhavana to beginners. Whenever I do it I find myself trying to 'put myself in the shoes of' whoever it is I'm visualising. For, how can one love someone when one does not make an attempt to comprehend their situation? This entails compassion - i.e. karuna. 

Today, while going through the stages of the metta-bhavana I felt truly powerful paroxysms of pity. It was difficult to breathe and stay seated upright. It took a great deal of effort to regain composure.

I understand now why the karuna-bhavana is reserved for more advanced practitioners. What I would like to know is if anyone has any tips on how I can practise the metta-bhavana without having this problem again? How can one try to demarcate the metta-bhavana from the karuna-bhavana? 




 I was racking my mind to think if I'd read any novels (and plays/poems) that portray a positive, lasting sexual relationship.

Just as I was writing this, I remembered the relationship between the protagonist of McEwan's 'Saturday' and his wife. Apart from that, I found examples a bit thin on the ground.

Can anyone provide me with examples in literature in which a long-term sexual-relationship is depicted as happy and healthy and non-neurotic? 














     I've been high and I've been low. 
    And I know which I'd rather be. 

    At the top of the atmosphere it starts to get lighter - 
    All the colours, whiter and whiter.

    Around us all, beyond the air, 
    The whirling, crushing cosmos bear,
    Lonely. Unfair.

    The cosmos absorbs us all so small.
    Still love. Still pity.

Moral of the story: Cherish wise attention. Value a-voidance.
 




 I've been high and I've been low. And I know which I'd rather be. As you get to the top of the livable atmosphere it starts becoming lighter - more enlightened. Beyond - the vasty dark cosmos. Wise attention. Value a-voidance. 




 Does anyone have a memory from before you learnt how to speak?  


































 Meditation is about stilling the mind so we can see clearly. Meditation is about getting into the actual life and experience of our consciousness. Meditation reveals how wonderful life could be. How free we could be. Meditation, and a simple ethical life, reveals the deep habits that have been a vital condition for evolutionary success: the single-minded urge for supremacy over other members of our own species; the survival of the fittest; of the quickest; of the strongest; of the randiest; the survival of the most cunning and selfish; of the best at supporting and promoting of oneself and one's kin; and, of course, the selfish exploitation of other species.

Probably all currently surviving species have been a condition in the extinction of all other competing or edible species. We are the first species to attempt to enforce fishing quotas and to limit our urges to hunt. Meditation and an ethical life increasingly reveals another possibility - a life beyond self-clinging beyond self-promotion - a life of empathy. Shantideva says, 'When fear and suffering are disliked by me and others equally, what is so special about me that I protect me and not the other.'

All of us need to respond to the suffering in the world. Are we going to respond more like an animal or more like a Buddha?

 I had a house party the other day and have several opened but unfinished cans of lager that have gone flat. It seems wasteful to pour them down the drain. Does anyone have any suggestions as to what I should do with the lager? 




 I believe that the following passages prove that the figure of Jesus should be considered, using the language of today, **a blood-thirsty terrorist**:

* "But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them  bring them here and kill them in front of me. (Luke 19:27 NIV)

* "He that is not with me is against me..." (Matthew 12:30 KJV)

* "Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword." (Matthew 10:34 NIV)

I believe that were he simply an advocate of peace and 'turning the other cheek' it would be unlikely that the Romans would have scourged and crucified him. It is my view that he was most likely a perpetrator and advocate of violence, and that his subsequent portrayal as a pacifist is the result of historical revisionism. 





































































 I believe that belief in the divinity of Mohammed, and therefore the inviolability of the Qu'ran, is a central part of being a Muslim. In accordance with the fact that the Qu'ran instructs Muslims to ''wage war against the unbelievers'', ''cast terror into the unbelievers' hearts'', and ''forsake this world for the next'', becoming a terrorist is the logical outcome of being a Muslim. CMV.

EDIT: I have changed my view somewhat (see below). Thank you to everyone who contributed to the discussion.

 I was watching a moth pottering around. Do they live lives of constant fear? Or can they experience joy and happiness? Was wondering if it would be humane to squash it or not.

 Human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell commented on the passing of Baroness Thatcher, saying she was extraordinary for mostly the wrong reasons, but going on to say: I dont rejoice in her death. I commiserate, as I do with the death of any person.

He continued: In 1988, the Thatcher government legislated Britains first new anti-gay law in 100 years: Section 28. At the 1987 Conservative party conference she mocked people who defended the right to be gay, insinuating that there was no such right.

During her rule, arrests and convictions for consenting same-sex behaviour rocketed, as did queer bashing violence and murder. Gay men were widely demonised and scapegoated for the AIDS pandemic and Thatcher did nothing to challenge this vilification.
