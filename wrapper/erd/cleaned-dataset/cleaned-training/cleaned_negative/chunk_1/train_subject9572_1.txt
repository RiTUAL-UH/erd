 Happy Reddit Birthday! 




 I think the special prices are relative to the monthly prices, not relative to the one year price. You get a savings on the one, two or three year prices if you use any of the monthly prices as your reference.

 Particles from the sun, such as those from a solar flare, travel much slower than light and therefore the delay. 




 The article loses credibility when the title states "... Should Hit Early Tuesday Morning (2/13/2011)"  Tuesday is not 2/13. 




 Not really.  The difference between a hard drive and a solid state drive is more than semantics.  They are physically quite different approaches to storage.  I'm betting it's an error in the ad. 




 Exhume?  I think we should just leaved this one buried. 




 Anyone notice the 32GB hard drive in the Best Buy ad?  *Hard Drive* ... really? http://www.bestbuy.com/site/Motorola+-+XOOM+Tablet+/+NVIDIA+Tegra+Processor+/+10.1%22+Display+/+1GB+Memory+/+32GB+Hard+Drive+-+Licorice/1946179.p?id=1218305636450 skuId=1946179 st=xoom cp=1 lp=1

 In terms of solar masses, the MW black hole is not 1,000 but 4,000,000.  The article states the M87 black hole 6.6 billion solar masses, while the MW black hole is 4 million solar masses.

6.6 billion / 4 million = 1650 so the M87 black hole is a 1650 times more massive than the MW black hole.

 




 The existence of anti-matter has been proved by many experiments. Scientists generate and measure anti-matter particles every day in particle accelerators. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimatter 




 mr_lightswitch is correct, I should have stated "... over a thousand times more massive that the Milky Way's central black hole" 




 Thank you! Up vote.

 Too late, I closed my account with B of A 15 years ago.  The reason? They said my account was overdrawn.  I checked my account balance and had more than $2K in it.  I called them up and they said, oh sorry we made a mistake.  Two weeks later same thing happened so I went into the branch.  They looked up my account and said, now Mr. Sheridan, we've had this conversation with you before and this is becoming a recurring problem.  I said, no shit, this is a recurring problem. Now close my account and give me my balance right now. They finally realized there was a different Mr. Sheridan whose account was overdrawn.  It was disturbing they couldn't even keep the accounts of two people with the same last name straight.

 Good to see we have an active subreddit here and thanks for the advice.  I think I'll steer clear for the time being unless I watch something I must post.  Then I'll post and stay confined to responses to avoid spoilers. 

By the way, just noticed the up/down votes are knives ... nice. 




 Yeah, is that fairly recent?  I don't remember so many ads on physorg. 




 Well, at least up to a mass of 3.54.5 TeV for a range of theoretical models that postulate extra dimensions. Those were the ones that bothered me most.

 Example 2:  The cones on the engine inlets moved in and out to account for the shock wave developed by traveling multiple times the speed of sound. Without this feature the engines' compressors would stall at high mach numbers due to lack of airflow into the engine. 




 Impressive aircraft in many respects.  Example 1: It was designed to leak fuel while on the ground (ok, maybe they couldn't help this) then seal itself as thermal expansion of joints took effect when the aircraft came up to temperature due to heating from air friction at operational speeds.

 Apparently you don't see the number of down votes you're receiving and recognize you're way off base, at least with respect to leading scientific theories.  

Maybe you're starting your own dark matter theory here on Reddit.  If it blows your dress up, go for it. 




 Once you create a facility that deep, you get multiple uses since many experiments are corrupted by cosmic rays. The mine is used to detect muons (product of cosmic ray collisions), neutrinos and dark matter.   




 I've stopped trying to figure out the rationale for up vs down votes. 




 Not to be argumentative, but dark matter is not the same as a black hole, at least according to the leading theories.  Dark matter appears to be more or less uniformly distributed within each galaxy, not necessarily between the galaxies and not tied up in individual localized black holes.  It is affected by gravity but not other forces such as electromagnetism.  Therefore dark matter is gravitationally attracted to galaxies as is ordinary matter.  

Dark matter is the only explanation scientists have for the orbital velocities of galaxies in clusters and the rotational speed of individual galaxies (spinning on their own axes).  Without the extra unseen mass explained by dark matter, galaxies would not behave as they do as they spin.

The vast majority of the dark matter in the universe is believed to be made up of nonbaryonic particles, and thus not formed out of atoms and not wrapped in the confines of black holes.

 At the rate it is traveling (~17 km/sec) it will take Voyager about 60 billion years to arrive at Andromeda, our nearest galaxy at a distance of about 2 million light years.  Keeping in mind our entire universe is a only ~13 billion years old, it is doubtful the sun and earth, let alone the human race, will even exist if/when it arrives.  Doesn't sound like a practical solution. 




 Agreed

 I don't know about that.  You can't ask a book a question and get a direct answer, even if through a mechanical sounding voice.

 I wouldn't rule out HDTV just yet.  The technology has caught on enough that sales overtook SD in 2008

I may be a bit biased here but unless you're watching an SD YouTube or other web vid or an oldy, HD is clearly better than SD.  Aspect ratio alone makes a statement on the screen, let alone resolution.  And 5.1 rocks! 




 nice 




 By "accepts wind from any direction" I mean from any direction in the horizontal plane, not from above or below.  This is true because the device is circularly symmetric so wind striking it from N, S, E or W will have the same affect on the turbine's rotation. 




 Yea, would like to see some numbers.  The best we have to go on is "... final costs of about $1.50/watt rated output, which is roughly 2/3 the cost of comparable bladed units."  Not a huge improvement but significant enough to pursue if it can be put to practice. 

I don't think the bladeless turbine needs a swivel base since it accepts wind from any direction unlike a bladed turbine - another advantage for the bladeless design.

 Good link. Yet another source for layman's physics info. 




 Thank you for that explanation.  Another response from an expert - two for two today.

Follow up question to your statement that we can measure dark energy.  How is that done?  Is the estimate based on the acceleration of the universe's expansion or some other method?   




 Wow, a response from an expert - thank you.  

Do you think the same is true with dark energy, that is no connection with hidden dimensions? 




 Thank you for the correction.  Wikipedia confirms you are correct

 Actually if you consider both Northern and Southern hemispheres each have a Vernal and Autumnal equinox, just 180 deg out of phase with each other, the article is correct in saying the Vernal equinox happens twice each year.  




 Correction, GMT-7 not GMT-8, at least for the next couple weeks until the rest of the world goes onto daylight savings time.  I really hate that the U.S. decided to mess around with the daylight savings time dates. 




 The article is a bit misleading when it says the Vernal equinox occurs twice a year.  Actually an equinox occurs twice a year but one is the Vernal and the other is the Autumnal.  They sort of clear it up in the last part of the sentence when they mention both. 




 You are correct but the planned shut down won't be for a while.  In a couple weeks they will start slamming the beams together to achieve 7 TeV collisions and keep that up for 18 - 24 months.  After the 7 TeV tests they plan to shut LHC down for a year or more. They need the break to complete repairs for an electrical failure that occurred in 2008 and to prepare the collider for the maximum 14 TeV collisions.  That'll be when the real sparks fly. 




 Have you switched from a Mac to a PC or are you limited to using a PC in this case?  When it comes to video editing you can't get much easier than a Mac.

 That is sufficiently close to sunset for the satellite to still be in view of the Sun and then pass into the Earth's shadow. 




 CliffDropOver is correct.  Eventually the satellite will pass into the Earth's shadow and appear to fade away.  How close in time to sunset/sunrise were you when you saw the satellite fade? 




 Oh, thanks for the clarification. 




 By the way, reddit put the NSFW tag on the link so they would seem to agree. 




 Some companies do not allow nudity of any form to appear on company owned computers, no matter the context.  I agree the subject should be ok for a work environment, but the photo may not be.  I don't make the rules but often have to follow them.

 No one has mentioned security yet. OSX has security vulnerabilities just like any OS, but Apple does not respond to these vulnerabilities as quickly as they should. Microsoft has shown an increased vigilance that Apple could learn from. Because Apple has enjoyed decades of small percentage market penetration theyve lulled themselves into thinking theyre more secure, but its really because they havent been attacked. The numbers are growing dramatically, and in my view it's simply a matter of time before the Mac OS experiences a big time hack. This is from a Mac fan boy. 




 I believe you are correct.  The sun is much larger with respect to the planet sizes than shown at any of the planet scale slider settings.  Also the planets are much too large in relation to their orbit sizes when the setting is at 1.0. 




 If so, God help us. 




 I am an electrical engineer and of all the classes I had at the undergraduate level, thermodynamics was the worst.  I could relate entropy to chaos but I couldn't translate the concept to "practical" problems. I'll never forget the problem: "A drop of rain falls from the sky into the ocean.  Does the entropy of the universe increase or decrease?" I had the class for 10 weeks and still couldn't get the answer to make intuitive sense.   




 I believe a photon is a fundamental quantum particle - doesn't break down any further (at least with today's physics). 




 nice 




 Couldn't agree more.  My wife and I who are both Apple fans bought one.  Weren't satisfied with its restrictions so we hacked it with ATVFlash to get more control and access of media not on iTunes.  Hack was too quirky and unreliable so we sold the AppleTV after a couple months and bought a Mac Mini instead.   We realized we needed a much more open media center, not a device that operates through iTunes like a big iPod (or should I say iPad?) 




 I like your take on this and have changed my mind.  U.S. broadband speeds are not shameful, just disappointing.  But I can (and obviously will) live with it.  We are fortunate to live in the times we do. 




 Magnetism is a subcomponent of light.  Light is an electromagnetic (electric + magnetic) phenomenon where both are intimately and orthogonally coupled.  So yes, the effect of magnetism travels at (not less than) the speed of light.

The answer to your question is yes, the other magnet would continue to repel for the time it took light (electromagnetism) to travel the distance between the two magnets. 




 Yes it's much more practical and economical to implement higher speed broadband in smaller countries.  Here's a site to give you a feel for broadband speeds in the U.S. http://www.akamai.com/stateoftheinternet/ 




 Understand and it probably won't come to pass, but look where the U.S. broadband speed currently stands wrt other nations http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/Images/commentarynews/broadbandspeedchart.jpg

 Yeah, I agree they had no idea what harmful effects x-rays may have had at the time.  But wouldn't she have been a little apprehensive putting her hand under an experimental contraption that allowed her to see her bones through her skin? 




 If you read or hear the words "zero point power", "infinite power" or "generates power indefinitely" your spidey sense should be activated. These would come in handy right now in Haiti but you won't be seeing any of these fictitious devices.

 Don't they need to address the other end of animals to tackle their aggravation of climate change?

 Thanks for the link.  Aldrin's quote is summarized here:
"There is a monolith there, a very unusual structure on this little potato-shaped object that goes around Mars once every seven hours. When people find out about that, they are going to say 'who put that there?'. Well, the universe put it there, or if you choose, God put it there." 




 Thanks, now that is helpful.
What did Aldrin have to say about it? 




 That's helpful. 




 So what would cause an optical illusion such as this? 




 I'd go for the PS3.  I watch blu-ray and my son does gaming on the PS3.  It has worked well for over two years for both applications.  

Not sure if anyone has mentioned it here but I believe the PS3 is still the fastest at loading blu-ray disks.  Some players take a long time to load and that can get really annoying. 




 I feel sorry for anyone who invests money in this venture. 




 Might this be the link you were attempting to post?

 The angle subtended by the black hole would be minuscule compared to the angle subtended by the massive galaxy, assuming the black hole was about midway between the Milky Way and the other galaxy.  This means the black hole would create a very small area of distortion in the image of the galaxy as viewed by a high power telescope (say Hubble).  Although some of the galaxy's image will be directly blocked (absorbed) by the black hole, much of this dark area will be filled in by light being bent (due to gravitational lensing) around the black hole.   




 Black holes theorized to be at the center of most galaxies are not good candidates for direct observation.  A black hole in the center of a galaxy is obscured by numerous stars, dust and other galactic debris shrouding the center.  That includes the black hole in the center of our galaxy.  Galactic centers are pretty dense areas. 




 I believe we can estimate the mass of a black hole pretty well for the case you give (a binary system containing a black hole and a star) for the reason you stated.  The path of the visible star is affected in a measurable way.  Scientists can estimate the mass of most visible stars pretty accurately based on distance and brightness.  Given the mass of the visible star and the diameter of its rotation around the unseen object (black hole) they can measure the mass of the black hole fairly accurately.  

I may not understand what you're getting with your comment on the "extra gravity".   You may be thinking that dark matter is matter that falls into a black hole?  If so, that is not dark matter.  Scientists theorize that dark matter is generally distributed around the galaxy and is not localized within black holes.  Although any matter can fall into a black hole (dark or energetic) and increase its mass accordingly.  It's all the same to the black hole.  Once it falls in, it is no longer defined as dark or anything else, it's just added mass to the black hole.

Yes, the black hole's event horizon will increase in size as it becomes more massive and this extra mass is quite measurable when the black hole is paired up with a star.  Other methods can be used to measure a black hole's mass such as gravitation lensing.

Another example of matter that interacts very weakly with other matter is the neutrino.  Neutrinos have almost negligible mass, no charge, travel nearly at the speed of light and do not interact with matter (almost). The mass and speed of neutrinos are still not certain and are being investigated. 




 Tyson is using the term "us" loosely.  Dark matter does not interact with us as individuals in a way we can measure directly on Earth.  But it does interact with the rest of our Milky Way galaxy and other galaxies as well as larger structures (galaxy clusters).  Astrophysicists have measured the rotation of these galaxies and stars within the galaxies.  They can't explain how the galaxies' rotations occur when they consider only the visible stars.  Keep in mind the rotation is not just the galaxy as a whole but the rotation rates of stars within the galaxies at varying distance from the galactic center. The only explanation that explains the internal rotations is additional mass distributed in and around the galaxies that cannot be seen (dark) and does not interact with electromagnetic energy.  
 




 Much better video.  Thank you. 




 A solar system reference frame is defined by the Sun not the Earth.  The Earth revolves around the Sun at many thousands of miles per hour.  If the helicopter is fixed with respect to the Sun, the Earth will immediately either slam into it or zoom away from at many thousands of miles per hour (depending on which side of the earth the helicopter is located with respect to the Earth's motion around the Sun) as it revolves around the Sun.  The pilot will either be crushed by the collision or be left in space to suffocate and freeze.  This won't take 12 hours but seconds
 
Did you possibly mean the Earth as the reference frame?  That is the only reference frame where fractions of a day (12 or 24 hrs) come into play. 




 Yes, you can have a point fixed in an expanding universe.   Think of an expanding balloon where the surface of the balloon is the reference frame. As the balloon (universe) expands, the point will expand with it.  Locally it will appear fixed but it will be moving away from other fixed points like points on the balloon's surface.  

You don't need to have a center to have a fixed point.  In this analogy, the balloon's surface has no center (the interior of the balloon is not part of the analogy, just the surface).  The same holds true with the universe. 




 No 




 Your scenario about a "fixed point in space" is ambiguous.  Space has many frames of reference: the earth, solar system, galaxy, galaxy cluster, super cluster and universe.  Each of these "space" reference frames moves at a different speed and rotates (and expands) at a different rate.  So first clarify your reference frame ... do you really mean the solar system or the earth or something else as your reference frame?  The answer to your question depends entirely on your reference frame.

When I think of a "fixed point in space", I think of the universe. 




 When it comes to advancing science at this level we often can't predict what the benefits will be.  Consider when the lasing effect was predicted by Einstein then later confirmed in the 60's through the invention of the laser.  Uses for the laser are almost too many to list but I'm guessing Einstein or the inventor or even the science community at large had no idea what the laser would eventually bring to our world.
