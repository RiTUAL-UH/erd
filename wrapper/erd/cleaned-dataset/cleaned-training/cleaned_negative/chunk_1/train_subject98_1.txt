 Brand new watch, I think it's beautiful but the crown is hard to screw down; seems tricky to align. Is this unusual? If I do not wear it everyday how do I keep it wound? Thanks 
































































 Living in Olympia WA geology is in your face and after reading McPhee I've got the bug. I am working through *Earth* 10th ed by Tarbuck *et al*, several books by David Alt *et al*.

Is there a geology equivalent to *Sky and Telescope*? The stuff I see is more oriented to rock hounds. Blogs or forums for amateurs? When I get some time I'd like to ramble around the scablands; any recommended spots? Thx!
