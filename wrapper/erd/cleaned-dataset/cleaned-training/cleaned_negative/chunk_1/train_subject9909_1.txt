I have observed this up close, and on a macro-environmental scale.

Our driveway has ten of these trees lining it, in northern MD (my father refuses to cut them down, so we killed saplings). The seedlings are thick, robust, and fill in unmowed and untilled ground. The young tree is thorny and sturdy. Maximum size will never be out of hand, as Callery Pears rarely grow past 30ft and the trunk will rarely pass 1.25ft diameter. Each year generates a great deal of seeds, enough to plant an acre at full maturity. I rarely see them eaten, though, so I think spread is mostly accidental and by treefall.

As with many large invasive species, these trees were prized for beautification qualities and introduced commercially.

The unmowed right-of-ways of Maryland are chock full of Callery Pears. Growing up in MD, I have noticed the spread of wild invasive growth from Montgomery County, through Howard and Baltimore Counties, and into Frederick and Carroll Counties. I have seen a right-of-way filled up to a 12ft wall of thorns in less than four years.

Easy to girdle, pull up, and kill in general. Even easy to find, because they flower brilliant white and before any other tree on the East Coast (I think)! The problem/focus with extermination lies with gaining the cooperation of nurseries, developers, and homeowners to remove existing trees and remove them from stock. I don't believe in bans, all that is needed is awareness and the appropriate creation of externality precedent. That means if you plant a new tree or refuse to cut an existing one down, you can be brought to court for restitution per seedling on another person's property (including the state right-of-ways).

The state of MD is not doing anything, that I know of. I have considered calling the DNR to ask what's up, but have not. I just found this sub from /r/permaculture and wanted to post. Any more info would be helpful, especially as to efforts and the status of other affected areas.

edit: Good news! kinda. Bad news first. We cut down a big white pine last year at the end of a row. This year a thousand pears are sprouting in it's shadow. Good news second. My dad conceded we probably should have cut those mature pears lining our driveway down - and we will. 






















































 http://www.wrcbtv.com/story/25356747/drug-debate-will-punishing-women-who-take-drugs-while-pregnant-help-hurt-or-both

Will the women doing this be feeling the pain from paying any medical bills for premature births or disorders? Making penalties explicit for harming the unborn will increase demand for abortions before it ushers responsibility for actions into the minds of men and women engaging in intercourse.

Is it a worse thing to place poor mothers in jail and string newborns and maybe siblings into state care? Possibly. And I don't want to give the state the power to do so, because it will undoubtedly be unjustly dealt to some poor family.

If affected women cannot free themselves from a drug addiction, why can we expect them to disengage from one of the more basic and powerful temptations? This law does not improve anything. Might doesn't make right in treating moral laxity.

 I say put your money where your mouth is, personally.

Sometimes putting your mouth somewhere is good enough, but usually not.

Just like charity, if you want something done you are better off doing it yourself (or as close to that as possible).

Recently, the Obama administration formed ties in Syria with groups classified as terrorists just across some imaginary lines in the sand. The homework was done, and the report was on the desk, but they made a decision well removed from what any of us would see as rational. We agree a state should not meddle abroad.

I think if an an-cap decided to do something it could be summed up like this:

* Individuals would know of the intentions of foreigners like we would know of any other person's through reputation and trusted sources.

* Individuals would support them like we would support anyone else. Personal financial support. Personal physical support. Organized financial support. Organized physical support. (this includes red-cross type groups, non-violent protest groups, violent protest groups, and militias/privateers/private armies)

If there isn't a state to prevent militias (etc.) from forming. Then there is no state to prevent militias (etc.) or individuals from going abroad.

So there are two questions.

1. How would you support a cause such as the Ukrainian riots, if at all, and how would you know whom to help?

2. Does that help ever introduce externalities upon your neighbors and region? (esp. in the case of organized physical support - militias, etc.) 









 I had a thought while reading this:

Is it fair to say that it is impossible for a human to be competent at any secretary-level position (or higher) in a modern world government?

American presidents and various prime ministers have been eking through terms by lying through their teeth and their direct underlings [get burnt out from trying to do their jobs, fired for failing to do their jobs, or keep their jobs by lying and shirking responsibility - then evading the consequences of that.](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2013/11/locked-in-the-cabinet-99374.html#.UwNsoPldWrg)

**Can we start making the argument that no person can effectively hold any position in a government this large, with so many powers?** There are not enough secretaries to receive all the information and too many secretaries for the executive to be briefed by them all. Are all modern world powers effectively structured anarchy (with a side of secretary-level oligarchy)?

 [This is super-speed video of the battle.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2zWWg7-Y6o)

When I ask"would this space battle ever happen," I mean to ask that in any case. EVE Online has a few special considerations which are unique and give reason to a few things. I only played a 14-day trial so not everything here may be perfect.

* No permadeath. Everyone is playing a person that is basically immortal and lives through clones. Every time your clone dies, the memories are all saved in your original so they pop out a new one and off you go.

* Sectors have security levels. Super-mega governments/civilizations enforce different levels of security in the different sectors. Some sectors are outside any NPC security. There is fighting in between these that players participate in, but there are also fights between player alliances - which this is. 

This battle, B-R5RB, was for player alliance control of a station located somewhere else. Two player alliances agreed to fight out control in this 0 security sector so no civilization would interfere - thus limiting or entirely removing NPC combatants and any consequences fighting in a secure sector have.

* All armaments are automatic. You pick a target for your ship or individual turrets/lasers/drones/missile racks and pilot the ship so the arms have the target in range of fire.

* Warp navigation. You navigate by engines inside sectors and between sectors by warp. Traveling between sectors is kind of like taking a train. No stops in between and not all sectors connect to every other sector. Some ships (notably the biggest ones) can group warp ships around them to arrive at the same time, in the same place.

Certainly all of these are imaginable, and all are futuristic - but are they realistic? Is the result, seen in the video, realistic?

Thoughts? Better destination ideas? 





























 Is this concept found already in any works?

I thought it up last night and am not well read, yet. Plenty of videos and thought under my lid, but I can't read at work.

In any case, this certainly explains how people see this thing called "government" which belongs to "everybody." With no owner (a government could only be "owned" by a sort of autocrat - not the worst thing if he's wise, but all men are fallible and nobody is fit to "rule" especially not in a permanent sense), each person who understands the the common nature of government will attempt to get the most profit out of it, ASAP. The profit comes at the expense of other's liberty - obviously abhorrent to us. But any effort to use and not dismantle this power structure, each user of the government indicates his rejection or ignorance of personal liberty. The former should be ashamed and the second admonished. 




 [Found this story](http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/science/2013/12/the-vast-majority-of-raw-data-from-old-scientific-studies-may-now-be-missing/#.UrPOyrx5sRg.reddit) on /r/PhilosophyofScience

Not a pure science question, but certainly up for discussion.

 When a group of researchers tried to email the authors of 516 biological studies published between 1991 and 2011 and ask for the raw data, they were dismayed to find that more 90 percent of the oldest data (from papers written more than 20 years ago) were inaccessible. In total, even including papers published as recently as 2011, they were only able to track down the data for 23 percent.

 Whats the solution? Some journals... have adopted policies that require authors to submit raw data along with their papers, allowing the journal itself to archive the data in perpetuity. Although journals, like people, are susceptible to changing email addresses and technological obsolescence, these problems can be much more easily managed at the institutional scale.

So where is your raw data? 









 Corn pudding is a good dish; easy to make. With a whole stick of butter it tastes pretty darn good. Bachelors! This takes a single dish to cook and refrigerates well in portions.

EDIT: [Pictures](http://imgur.com/a/9HOpp)

*Time:* Leave butter out til soft. Prep takes ten minutes. Cooking takes an hour. Serve immediately.

*Recipe:*

* **1** [can whole corn (drain the liquid before using)](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Great-Value-Golden-Sweet-Whole-Kernel-Corn-15.25-Oz/10315427)

* **1** [can creamed corn](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Great-Value-Cream-Style-Sweet-Corn-14.75-oz/10448549)

* [**1** box corn muffin mix](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Jiffy-Corn-Muffin-Mix-8.5-Oz/10448133)

* **4** eggs

* **1/2** cup butter (1 standard American stick, I believe)

* **1/2** cup sour cream

Leave the butter out to soften on the counter, covered or in the wax wrap. This should be done long enough in advance to make sure it is pliable. Maybe a few hours. (If you don't do this, you won't be able to mix the butter in fully. Absolutely not a problem, the butter will melt and get in there just fine - but getting it to mix is the proper way.) Some people zap the butter in a microwave at the last second. If that is you plan, might I recommend placing the butter in the casserole dish? 

* Combine the ingredients in a 2 quart casserole dish (oven-safe dish). We us a round dish as high as it is wide. If your dish is glass, you can watch the butter bubble towards the end. I add the wet ingredients first and make sure they are well mixed, then the corn muffin mix, and then the butter.

* Bake at 350 degrees (ovens in US are in Fahrenheit) for 55-60 minutes, or until a knife inserted comes out clean.

* Serve hot, immediately is fine.

We have this every year at thanksgiving. I had to make it this year because everyone else was too busy with our 8 other vegetables and two turkeys. And candied yams. That means it was in the oven for 45 minutes too low, and then 30 minutes too high because other dishes were more important. Last year the sour cream stayed in small clumps and was not enough to make me not eat this. My grandmother was too busy and did not mix thoroughly. I call it invincible because it is very hard to mess up, especially to an inedible state.

*Original accompanying newspaper clipping from my New Jersey Grandmother's house:*

 Corn Pudding

 (ingredients)

 Combine all ingredients in a 2-quart casserole dish. Bake at 350 degrees (F) for 55-60 minutes or until a knife comes out clean.

 Ruth T Nadolny of Hamilton says her family came upon this Corn Pudding recipe from an unexpected source.

   "Years ago my daughter Linda Burch took ka bus trip to Tangier Island in Chesapeake Bay with her grandmother. When dining, they were served corn pudding, which they thought was delicious. My daughter ventured to ask for the recipe and, surprisingly, they gave it to her. It has been a family favorite for many years now."

I can say the same for my family, we enjoy this immensely next to our Thanksgiving celery salad, brussel sprouts, and succotash. Funnily enough the recipe came full circle when I got it from my grandmother, because I live in Maryland. 




 Bill Nye's [open letter to Obama](http://youtu.be/XkWetbQHWlk) to divert more of NASA's budget to the Planetary Science Division needs this reply:

Showing that government is an able player in solving new, previously unseen, problems extends the delusion that government can centrally plan any part of human life more effectively than an individual or voluntary association.

I think NASA has done some wonderful work and solved some amazing problems with ingenious solutions, but private industry has begun to invest in space exploration. Private industry has invested in space sciences since the first communications satellites.

 Excerpts from official statement:

This year's program will focus on privateers during the "Golden Age of Sail." Leave your eye patches and parrots at home, there will be no pirates or buried treasure here! However, visitors of all ages will be able to participate in authentic drills and exercises. You will learn about the weapons and tactics required for capturing or defending a sailing ship at sea.

 Guest instructors will include Mark P. Donnelly and Keystone Academy of Dueling and Swordsmanship. They will be assisted by Park Ranger Victor Markland and members of the Mid-Atlantic Society for Historical Swordsmanship.

[Here is the quoted Plan Your Event page for the park website.](http://www.nps.gov/hamp/planyourvisit/event-details.htm?eventID=498941-232573)

[This is the facebook page to RSVP on. An RSVP is not required.](https://www.facebook.com/events/526334984068570/)

I attended this event last year, the theme was more towards the gentlemanly sports. There were a few young attendees; plenty of adults. The Hampton historic site is quiet, beautiful, and well kept. Bring plenty of water, and a hat or sunscreen. If you want to visit at times other than the event, tours of the mansion and farm site's buildings are offered on FRIDAY, SATURDAY and SUNDAY ONLY from 10 am to 4 pm. Buildings are closed to the public Monday through Thursday. Grounds are open daily from 8:30 am to 5 pm.

 I may have shut down my computer at the wrong time...

Dell Precision T1650

Computer out of box, added all the work software (adobe, bentley, Acad, deltek...), performed automatic updates twice, and restarted for extra freshness. Then, because I have to re-install autocad with a single license for the intended user, I uninstalled AutoCAD. It said Windows Explorer needed to be stopped to complete - don't worry, we'll restart it! (Yes, No, Reboot)

I said yes. Windows Explorer stopped, and the uninstall completed.

...

...

Where is my desktop?

I don't know what to do at this point, and figure a restart will fix it. I press the physical button, but never changed the option for "what does the power button do" So I think it tried to sleep. I mash the power button down for a hard reboot.
Give it a few... power on... Nothing. The box turns "on" and "off" swiftly, and no fans run. Monitor blank - tried using all display ports.

Keyboard lights up.

It does not run the recovery CD on insertion.

This is the hardest I have ever screwed a pc, how do I fix this mess?

Mr. JONES submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary

CONCURRENT RESOLUTION

Expressing the sense of Congress that the use of offensive military force by a President without prior and clear authorization of an Act of Congress constitutes an impeachable high crime and misdemeanor under article II, section 4 of the Constitution.

Whereas the cornerstone of the Republic is honoring Congresss exclusive power to declare war under article I, section 8, clause 11 of the Constitution: Now, therefore, be it

Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that, except in response to an actual or imminent attack against the territory of the United States, the use of offensive military force by a President without prior and clear authorization of an Act of Congress violates Congresss exclusive power to declare war under article I, section 8, clause 11 of the Constitution and therefore constitutes an impeachable high crime and misdemeanor under article II, section 4 of the Constitution.

 I am working on a business plan for a service which requires a digital product. My field is drafting/modelling - not coding. This service will help designers and companies share, render, and advertise their built environments in a realistic city setting. So far, I have narrowed possibilities for creating the city to Unity3D with C#.

The digital product I require needs basic realistic graphics, an update-able city-sized map, and multi-platform availability (for read-only interaction)

The city buildings might be procedurally rendered, I think its called, where the buildings are all distributed by an algorithm, and seed numbers can be saved to keep the layout the same.

I need to know if creating this product is feasible with Unity3D. Tell me what other info you need to give me an answer. **Even if you cannot give me the answer yourself, expanding the criteria I need to gather is important.** Suggesting other communities to ask in is also a big help.

This article has been posted in other subreddits. This issue may only apply to US residents.

As far as I can tell:
American hospitals subscribe to GPOs to keep prices low. There are less than ten companies making 80% of US supply on vintage production lines. The US bars import of foreign supplies for use in health care (?). The FDA found real problems with the US products and told producers to shut down lines to fix the problems. A shortage ensued because no producer knows the capabilities of any other and no hospital knows how much every other hospital has. Nobody knows when more will be available. Nobody wants to tell anybody else about the problem for fear of public reprisal.

We can talk politics elsewhere, but I thought these questions should be addressed before a problem arises. These are questions that may appear if both Soylent and the shortage get press coverage at the same time, and may be sensational or blunt. I encourage you to share any other ideas and questions!

* Are the short chemicals and providers the same as the ones used for the Soylent formula?

* Can Americans acquire and use foreign products?

* Does buying supply kill babies? (sensational *and* blunt)

* Does increasing demand out of health care help incentivize producers to increase production more rapidly and modernize production?

 I am looking to ta talk to a developer with unity3d experience. Want to meet to talk about possible digital product.  Know anyone?  




 I am not gamedev of any sort, but have an product idea and need to know if it will work - this will help me work on the business proposal for the service which would use the product. Thanks for helping.

This product is a medium sized city filled with default buildings, rendered in realism, in which users can submit buildings to be replaced with personally made models. It should be accessible on a web browser without installing an application to the computer and be accessible through a mobile application. In the best case, a link in a webpage or email can send you to a specific address in the city. The focus is on the models, not interaction. In this way, it would resemble a changeable Epic Citadel demo on a city-wide scale.

Do you expect this will be possible with UE4?
Will the map be too large, and loading times too great? This isn't procedurally generated.

It looks like my only other option for would be Webgl... and it is a bit primordial. But please enlighten me to my other options; none I remember is powerful enough for the level of graphics I need.

**tl;dr** What if I made an epic city (think looks like epic citadel), where you could put your buildings in, then everyone could go look at them on mobile and in-browser. Could I do it on UE4? 









 My experience is in CAD drafting and architectural design. I have an idea for an online service which revolves around a digital product. My business plan needs fleshing out.

The digital product is a realistically rendered city. I must be able to update the map and link to locations via hyperlink in browser. It should be accessible from as many devices as possible, with mobile being a choice possibility.
What I need to know is if any game engines out there would work, or if it needs a fresh engine? Unreal engine 4 is cross platform and powerful, but I need to be able to direct people to distinct locations from a link outside the application.

Is this where to start ? Also I'm near Baltimore if you want a chat.
Advice is appreciated. So are criticisms and corrections ;] I haven't told you what the service based on the product will be on purpose.
I dunno if it will say below, but this is cross posted /r/gamedev, /r/inat, and /r/gamedevclassifieds

 With a New propensity for governments to use biometrics to collect our data and verify our identity, I think at least here in the United States of America a constitutional amendment is needed to control this resource. Immediate and reliable identification processes can be used to catalog and corral people like cattle,especially during the implementation of martial law.
I propose that a two-thirds supermajority of both houses of congress would be necessary to expand the use of biometrics in federal jurisdiction.
