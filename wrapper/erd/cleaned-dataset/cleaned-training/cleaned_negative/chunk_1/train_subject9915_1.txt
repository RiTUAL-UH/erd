 First off, I'm the representative for the CoS on this sub.   
You're asking some leading questions here. What do you consider "active"? What do you the expect the Church of Satan to do for you? The Church of Satan is an organization of individuals, all of whom share a base common ground on the acceptance of Satanism and works of LaVey, but beyond that our members vary in political, philosophical, and personal interests. For the Church of Satan to act as a group in many cases is illogical and counter productive towards our members. Instead, the Church of Satan will promote the individual activities of individual members so long as it has it is in agreement with Satanism.   

The goals of the Church of Satan are to maintain the works of LaVey, to promote the activities of publicly open Satanists who affiliate with the Church of Satan and apply Satanism to the real world, and to push for the Pentagonal Revisionism. These are the only political/social goals for the COS as a group. For details on this, see LaVey's article: http://www.churchofsatan.com/pentagonal-revisionism.php  

Here is Magistra Blanche Barton's update on the program: http://www.churchofsatan.com/five-point-plan-revisited.php  


Speaking of Barton, she just did presentation on the history of the Church of Satan and its role in secularism as part of a larger forum on the history of secular humanism in San Diego. This was 3 weeks ago.  

The Church of Satan is pragmatic and realistic. We know that certain goals cannot be attained by waving a Sigil of Baphomet banner. You have to get into the system and work it from the inside, and we have many members doing just this. In certain situations we will work with other organizations openly, like we have with the Center for Inquiry.   

I'm often referred to public rituals as an indicator for "activity". LaVey publicized Church of Satan rituals in the early days (late 60's, early 70's), but then locked the doors and did not perform any public rituals for the rest of his life. Since LaVey's passing there have been a handful of public Satanic rituals, including the 6/6/6 Satanic Mass at the Center for Inquiry, and a public celebration of Dashwood and the Hellfire Club at the Hellfire Caves in Southeast England. Keep in mind, a "Satanic ritual" does not need to be a group of robed men surrounding an altar. The goal of Satanic ritual is to cause change in the real world, and this can be done through a powerful speech or a moving musical performance. Many of our members have preferred this method, and we're out there more and more.  

About the fee: Satanists are material, pragmatic, and carnal. We do not believe in selling souls and empty blessings. We will not fool you into thinking we're a charity and that our time is without value. Support is material, and most easily represented in the form of monetary funds. What is done with this? By and large it's to cover administrative expenses, costs of media representation, legal expenses, and various technical expenses. And that's after we paid the taxes, which we believe all religious organizations should do. I've spent time with the Church of Satan's High Priest and Priestess and there is A LOT that needs to get done on a day-to-day basis. When a couple of idiots kill someone in the name of Satan and the media catches wind of it, guess who gets called? Yes, we have the FBI and local police on speed dial. This takes time, effort, and money. And like you say, it's not a whole lot of it for a lifetime membership. I just spent this much buying records today. What are you going to get out your membership? Nothing if you sit around waiting for something to be handed to you. Do you want to work with other Satanists who may share common interests or real world goals? I know many members who've done just that, professionally, artistically, and academically. It's up to you to decide how much you want to be active or inactive. We have a number of members who tipped their hat and go along their way, applying Satanism in their activities without declaring themselves as Satanists.  




 Charles Manson said he was the second coming of Christ. People say a lot of things, especially people who aren't chemically balanced.  




 Just because the media reports something as "Satanic" doesn't make it so. The kid was obviously a nutcase, enough said. Nothing to do with Satanism at all. There is no such thing as selling your soul to anything. If ANYONE believes otherwise they are delusuonal and have no rational, philosophical, or metaphysical ground to stand on. Period. 









 1. You have a fundamental misunderstanding of "indulgence" if you equate it to hedonism. What's wrong with being at peace and wanting to relax? As LaVey recalls of Catism, "He who sleeps the day away, lives to sleep another day".  

2. Satanists except themselves for who they are. If they feel that their potential is not fully realized, they may work towards achieving that, so far as it's fun. Happiness and being content with oneself is true Satanism.  

3. The Satanic Bible is bombastic, it's meant to trigger instinctual reactions. These can be either positive and or negative. LaVey even described it as a necessary style for the time. He was inspired by the philosophy of Voltaire, who believed small, concise but powerful tracts would inspire revolutions. The Satanic Bible is bedrock, foundation, upon which further study is necessary. Some call this Deep Satanism, and the Church of Satan encourages those who wish to further the philosophy of Satanism to study Western philosophy, religion, anthropology, the natural sciences, and history. Was "turn the other cheek" an aggressive taunt for the Romans? Maybe, but that was not the context in which Jesus taught. See his Beatitudes.  

4. Satanism rejects self-deception. Satanism is a religion. Not all religions are simply self-deception. Ask yourself, how big of a role did Christianity play in maintaining slavery and discrimination in comparison with how it helped? I would argue that such movements had much more to do with economic outcomes than spiritualism (see The Economics of the Civil Rights Revolution by Gavin Wright, Stanford University)  

5. "I feel Satanism has become stagnant over the years since Dr. LaVey's death." Huh? As someone who's been involved in Satanism and the activities of the Church of Satan since the late 90's I can't understand how people continue to proclaim this. Major gatherings? Which major gatherings? What do you consider major? What do you define as "stagnant" or "active"? Performing public rituals? More public rituals have been performed in the past 6 years than in the last 20 of LaVey's life. I promoted an event here on this sub for a musical event in NYC that featured a number of Satanists, that was heavily attended by the Church of Satan, and it sold out the venue. And if you grasped the most basic fundamentals of Satanism you would have caught on what was presented on stage, and many have. So either you're looking in the wrong places or you willfully have your head in the sand. 




 I also have no interest in a flame war, but I will not leave sloppy logic unchallenged. There are fundamental first principles we will disagree on and I do not hide these biases, but they are clearly defined. I ask for the same from others who usually retort with "don't tell me what to do!" or "occult mysteries".  




 Protestants call themselves protestants, and would say Catholics are improper Christians at best, and they often argue that Catholics are not Christians at all. In fact, both parties call each other satanic.  

"The term was used to describe a certain set of beliefs for a very long time."  

By who? As far as I can tell, the terms "satanism" and "satanic" were used by the Abrahamic religions as a derogatory term, or by Abrahamic heretics who chose to worship for the "other side" but always recognized and operated under Abrahamic cosmology, and very often reverting to standard dogma. 




 They are being theologically (according to their own "believed" mythologies) and philosophically (according to rational metaphysics) inconsistent. And that's being polite about it. 




 And this is why devil worship should be vehemently rebuked.  



















 The last symbol goes by various names, the Brimstone Cross, Leviathan Cross, etc. It's based on the alchemical symbol for sulfur/brimstone, which comes from volcanos and hot springs, giving connotations of hellfire. In rituals it can used as a phallic symbol, or a symbol of fire and strength. The Brimstone Sigil is used by High Priest Peter Gilmore and is featured on limited edition of the [Satanic Scriptures](http://www.satanicscriptures.com/). 




 Funny how many Westerners who push the Buddhist idea of "love your enemy" come from pampered backgrounds. A fluffy ideal that has no place in the history of man, today or sixteen hundred years ago. Especially among Buddhists, who's very existence in many instances depended on hating your enemies. Unless you can say you love your enemies in your heart as you spear them.

This philosophy is suicidal. And that's not bashing it, this is exactly what it is. Let's not forget Gandhi. "Whenever you are confronted with an opponent. Conquer him with love." Who would tell the Jews that suicide is more heroic than fighting for your life: "But the Jews should have offered themselves to the butcher's knife. They should have thrown themselves into the sea from cliffs."   




 There are also a number of rituals in [High Priest Peter Gilmore's book The Satanic Scriptures](http://www.amazon.com/Satanic-Scriptures-Peter-H-Gilmore/dp/0976403595/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-7850525-6432757?ie=UTF8 s=books qid=1182438419 sr=8-1/churchofsatan). 




 And one more thing, there is no Satanic community. 




 The "Marriage to the Beast" is some bullshit spewed by David Icke and fanatical Christians. There is no such ritual in actual Satanism.  
  
If you want to see what a real Satanic ritual looks like take a look at this video of the Church of Satan's 6/6/6 event.  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1zsIk6WcNM 









 There aren't many "blogs" covering Satanism as defined by the Church of Satan. Most of the writers in our organization focus on books, magazines, and journalism that's not explicitly "Satanic". For example, Kevin Slaughter's [Underworld Amusements](http://www.underworldamusements.net/) publishes a number of books, including High Priest Gilmore's Satanic Scriptures. He also produces a number of video interviews and features.

 I was on board until the cheesy guitars kicked in. 




 Stephen O'Malley and Z'ev - Magistral is my favorite SUNN/SOMA related project   

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR_Fb_83KGI 














 Exactly. 




 From "Mirror, Mirror"  
"Instead, in publicly funded forums we support secular mementoes of the legacy of those who struggled to build this nation, not a plethora of conflicting belief systems. Individual Satanists also support the worthy efforts of groups such as the ACLU to combat religious encroachment on public grounds. I suspect other secularists are doing the same."  

How about a monument to the secularism of the founding fathers, or a monument declaring the separation of Church and State? Whatever the case may be, it should not be played out to make Satanism (and Satanists) look like a joke.  



















 Favorite proper Sunn album would be  Void. But favorite SOMA related release would have to be the Stephen O'Malley   Z'EV - Magistral album. 



















 When LaVey used the term "Psychic Vampire" he was not talking about anyone with mystical or magic(k)al powers. He was referring to what /u/magicnerd212 is describing. Another way a Psychic Vampire gets their hooks in you is via gifting. They hand you an unwanted or unexpected gift and then in turn expect a life-time of loyalty and free entry into your life. Beware.   

There are other uses of the term "Psychic Vampire" by various occultists and mystics, these are not the same thing.  




 And they didn't actually "invoice" the government, Cevin Key was explaining the concept of the "Weapon" title and their plan to make the image of the invoice their cover art. That fell through and didn't happen.  
http://www.liisaladouceur.com/blog/ogre-of-skinny-puppy-on-guantanamo-torture-and-music-as-a-weapon/    
"The project was about going as far as we could, then to present to the US government, or whoever we could find that was responsible for torturing people with our music, an actual invoice for what they owe us for using our music.  We would make the cover art the invoice. The idea of a free society to me, is not one that tortures people. I cant live with that, and not call it out." 




 I was invited to attend but couldn't make it. I got the video from Richard Devine's Twitter Feed: https://twitter.com/RichardDevine

"But lacking humor and perspective, lacking the satanic instinct, you stick to your levels and straight lines, squat there in the morass of your beatified illusions; and it is well for you thus, you mud-moles - bait that you are on the hooks of my venomous pride!" 














 It's a podcast episode for the show Vox Satanae. If you scroll down you can play the episode in your browser or download the MP3.   
You can get more episodes or subscribe to the show on iTunes here:

"Vox Satanae (Voice of Satan) presents classical music with an emphasis on vocal music from its inception through the present in all of its forms. Each show contains a variety of music in the areas of chant, choral, opera, song, theater, film, and instrumental for your listening enjoyment." 



















 LaVey was optimistic about the general population embracing Satanism in the early years of the Church of Satan. He was right in that faith in Christianity was in decline, but instead of liberation, the masses sought another master, the television. You can see his growing disappointment and misanthropy through his later writings.   
Most humans will seek external validation, especially in the ethereal. Even some misguided would-be Satanists think LaVey should be a personality to worship. I believe in every society there will be rare individuals who have the Satanic element in their bones.  




 Good job giving her the attention she wanted. 














 I don't need a dog right now. I don't need a dog right now... Augh! So tempted to go out and get a frenchie! 









 Great collection! I like the big guy on the top left.  









 Dawn of War 2 at the peak of its popularity. Intense, micro heavy combat with replays that looked like cinematic battles. 









 "Because the groups vary widely in their understanding of Satanism, it is quite impossible to examine them all. My impression is that most may be sole practitioners or even small groups of less than ten, probably active solely on the Internet, while a small amount of other groups have begun to create firmer ideologies, assemble offline, construct hierarchies, and increase membership. Scholars have not extensively studied most of the above apart from Internet presence and textual analysis of available literature; hard statistical data about these groups as a lived religion is absent."  

See the paper for the numbers that back up the author's impressions. 




 What's a Satanist without a sense of humor? Glad to oblige. 




 This quote summarizes the points I'm making: "As apparent above, when Satanism moves beyond its initial time and place, it adjusts to new particulars. Diaspora Satanism now has multiple factions, a variety of selfunderstandings, and degrees of compatibility or hostility with the Church of Satan/LaVey. Schismatic groups are now reinterpreting Satanism to such an extent that scholars are forced to consider that Satanism is now an inappropriate term when discussing groups or ideologies that have moved beyond Satanism." 




 Who had a semantic/etymological argument? The only one I see is "When I speak of theistic satanism I speak directly of the people and religions who were branded as satanic since the early days of christianity." I responded with a very clear example of why that's faulty. 

Want a historgraphic study of Modern Satanism? Here you go. Sorry but a 121 Graduate Thesis is a little hard to summarize in a Reddit comment (121 pages is the summary of the research).

http://www.academia.edu/2540808/2012._Satanists_and_Scholars_A_Historiographic_Overview_and_Critique_of_Scholarship_on_Religious_Satanism_Masters_Thesis_Dept._of_Religion_Concordia_University 




 Those were based on what I've encountered, so yeah I'd say it's pretty accurate. Does that extrapolate to the general population? Probably not, I think there are whole lot more who are mentally handicap. 









 "When I speak of theistic satanism I speak directly of the people and religions who were branded as satanic since the early days of christianity."  

That's ridiculous. Protestants and Zoroastrians were branded as satanic by the Catholic Church. By your logic Protestants would be the largest Satanic group in the world!  




 "The main issue I have is people blindly ignoring the very real existence of other subsets of believers who have been considering themselves Satanist long before CoS existed."  
  
The issue here is that, by and large, most historical "Satanists" were actually heretical Christians, or were labeled as "satanic" by various Christian/Jewish/Muslim groups as a way of ostracizing and condemning political/religion enemies (see The Knights Templar).  

Were there Satanists before the existence of the CoS? Most certainly! We would consider them "Defacto Satanists". Many would not have considered themselves Satanists because the idea of Satanism did not exist then. I'd use Benjamin De Casseres or H.L Mencken as examples. In our studies we've come across a small handful of Satanists who might be considered spiritual or theistic before LaVey (a few that LaVey knew personally), but they had little to no followings. LaVey looked around, had an extensive library and international contacts, he sought out "Satanists", and was very disappointed with what turned up. He documents this in writing and names individuals he came across.  

"Not sure why people seem to think those are the only sorts of people who fall into that theistic realm."  

Because that's what you see in the real world. I've been across the United States, Canada, and Europe and 95% of the time I've ran into "theists" or "spiritual" Satanists they're goth kids or metal heads who are trying way too hard to be evil and spooky. Then 4% are literally mentally handicap. The rest are heretical Christians or Muslims, and ex. Church of Satan people who started seeing "visions" when things didn't go their way. 




 You hit on various issues I have with what you consider "theistic satanism".  
  
1. "Being exposed to much of the Satanism communities myself over my lifetime". What does that mean? Online communities? Those are a dime a dozen, mostly filled with metal heads who think worshiping "Satan" is cool and makes them look evil. No theology involved, and if so, spotty at best.  
  
2. "Many of which stem from ancient forms of paganism that predate the existence of christianity or judaism." If this "theism" predates Judeo/Christianity, then it certainly predates the Abrahamic Satan, and therefore why in the world is it referred to as satanism?   
I'll cut people at the pass here who would then say "well, if you don't believe in Satan then why does the COS call themselves Satanists?" Anton LaVey's philosophy is pragmatic, rational, and not based on any theistic spiritualism, instead based on the *Hebrew term*, along with various psychological and sociological insight, and with an open mind to the unknown. Since we do not fool ourselves into believing in any conscious Gods that created man, we have the intellectual freedom to pick and choose the myths, symbols, and metaphors that best fit our needs.  
I'll give the Temple of Set credit, they least drop and refute the term Satanism. Because they believe in the actual God of Set they refer to themselves as Setians and practitioners of the Left Hand Path.   
  
I don't go out of my way to argue against theists here. Unless a question is asked or a false claim is made. But in the off chance that I happen to find myself in such a "debate", the only thing I ask for is consistency. If you claim spirituality, theology, belief in actual Gods and choose to worship them, you are buying into the whole lot. I'm often met with typical teenage aghast ("Don't tell me what to do! I'll do what I want!") All this signals to me is that you're not interested in theism, satanism, or anything of the sort, you're just a pretentious, angry kid (or adult child) trying to piss of your superiors (parent, community, parole officer).  
  
Anyone who studies history knows the importance of etymology. Terms and definitions are important. LaVey was not kidding when he said the first 99 years are always the toughest. He was not interested in a flash in the pan Pop Culture phase. He was deadly serious about making Satanism a recognized, organized, structured religion with its own meta-culture. So it is through the Church of Satan that his goals will be realized, in the real world accomplishments of our members and non-member affiliates, through academic and political work, and through surviving the current Invisible War. 




 Could be because there have already been 4 or 5 posts about this topic here. 




 Indeed it is... 




 *Into everyones life appear individuals who just dont seem to want to go away. They surface in many forms, but have certain common denominators. They are epitomized by the guy who is 86ed from the local bar for stirring up shit, falling through the plate glass door and suing, welching on bar tabs, and carelessly almost setting the place on fire. A week after he is told his business is no longer welcome, he pops in and tries to cadge a drink from his old buddy, the bartender. Just like nothing had happened.*    



















 Looking sharp! 














 I'm not crazy about the statement that Satanic "roots can be found in the Islam, Christianity and in Judaism". Maybe if you only focus on certain symbols and metaphors, but the religion as a whole has much deeper and substantial roots in that works of Milton, Wilde, Nietzsche, Mencken, Rand, and similar writers over Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. 




 The Temple of Set believes that LaVey and the Church of Satan received divine grace from an actual God in the form of Satan (which LaVey and the COS have denied). When Aquino was denied further control of the COS and was told to buzz off with "magickal initiations" he started to have visions of Set who gave him directions to start the Temple.  

So "Sethianism" had no role in the development of Satanism. Set can be used in certain Satanic rituals but that's a reference to Egyptian mythology, nothing "Sethian" about it. The basic texts of the TOS pretty clearly state that Satanism is an abomination and they claim no relationship with the religion other than it was the first phase that early TOS members went through.  




 In an upcoming book High Priest Gilmore will expand on the Satanic   Epicurean connection. 




 [Church of Satan: Theory   Practice](http://churchofsatan.com/theory-practice.php) 









 LP has sold out! CD is still available http://southernlord.com/store/view/terrestrials-1 




 You yourself keep name dropping the Church of Satan! You keep mentioning us in interviews and marketing! Sure, you backtrack now on a Reddit thread, but when the spotlight is on it's you who goes scrambling for that identity! Are you kidding?

**Doug was not a member.** The Church of Satan is a professionally run organization with records on all communications, memberships, and affiliations. We searched the records and there is NO MENTION of a Doug Mesner anywhere! The only people who claim he was a member are you (who has a history of making shit up) and Doug, who you, yourself, are claiming is not reliable.

If I remember the communications from Ely, it was they who thought you were mentally retarded. But let's not digress. Don't talk about having balls... you were chased out of a small sweet town for being a jackass and then playing the poor victim card. Sorry, but we received reports back from Ely about how the town actually was being very generous with you, you were the one being either delusional or making mountains out of molehills for the express purpose of cashing in on it. Either way it failed.  

You have a long history of ignoring e-mails, letters, communications of various sorts, including those pertaining to copyrights. Did you forget that you sold the rights to the LaVey and Peter MIR pieces? Or how about when you sold RFS and were supposed to hand over merchandise that needed fulfilling? You were more than happy to take people's money and then *forget*.  




 You talk of a "cult of personality" but it's you who puts so much importance on your one meeting with LaVey and how LaVey was so much more this or that. Of course you'll backtrack on this thread, but it'll be a whole other story later.  




 As far as I know, no. 




 Shane, Doctor himself kicked out many people from the Church of Satan. People he met on more than just a single occasion, people he granted titles to. Meeting him once does not give you a free pass to shit on others without repercussions. You **do not** decide who remains in the Church of Satan or not,  High Priest Gilmore and High Priestess Nadramia make those calls.   

Again, let's make this clear. This is **not about disagreements**. This is about going in public, on a live stream, spewing repugnant rants against multiple people. Do you think everyone just forgot about that? Water under the bridge? If Doctor heard another COS member say anything about him close to what you said about the current High Priest he'd do far worse than kick them out. You seem to live in a world where you think there are no consequences to your actions.  




 **Let this be very clear.**

As of your public outburst mid-2007 (CORRECTED), you were no longer a member of the Church of Satan. If that wasn't clear to you then, make it clear now.  

The Church of Satan has reviewed all records and can find **no record** of Doug Mesner ever being a member of the Church of Satan. If he told you this he either applied under a different name which we cannot verify or he lied to you.  

Also, you do not have the rights to Might is Right. You sold it off, along with Radio Free Satan, in 2007. I am the current technical director of Radio Free Satan and a Reverend in the Church of Satan.  




 "Disagreements"? No one is expected to "worship" a hierarchy, we certainly have members who disagree with each other on various things, but we will not tolerate public preschool name calling. I listened to your public, live rant on Radio Free Satan, on which you said some incredibly rude things about a number of Church of Satan members, including High Priest Gilmore.  Do you seriously think **any** organization of any kind would keep you around after a public outburst like that? Think about *that* for a second.   
Like Doctor put it, you took a shit on the floor and kicked yourself out.

Having a long-standing valvular problem which is associated with rheumatic heart disease, Anton LaVey had a kind of massive cardiac arrhythmia after several events of internal bleeding had been treated in hospital during late summer of 1997. He died on October the 29th, in St. Marys Hospital, a Catholic hospital associated with the University of San Francisco. He was brought to St. Marys because it was the closest hospital to his residence; he had never been treated there before. Although there has been some confusion with his funeral records (some listed Halloween as his death date), rumors that his death had been caused deliberately by a Christian nurse are grossly false. He was given a Satanic funeral, attended only by his closest relatives and was cremated afterwards.  




 His last wife, Blanche Barton, who is still involved in LaVey's Church of Satan, just recently did a presentation in regards to Satanism and its overlap with Secular Humanism at meeting for the Humanist Association of San Diego.

 VICE has an issue with anyone who doesn't let themselves be a tool. I know one ex-VICE writer who left due to such issues, and there appears to be only one or two writers left there that I have any respect for. Their work quickly gets buried underneath the dozen stories about being Gay or Trans in Russia (yes, it sucks, we get it) or hanging out with Snoop Dogg and Pitbull. 




 All of the above? It depends on the context in which it's presented, but all those suggestions sound valid. It's often used in communications as a farewell salute between respecting parties. Since Satan represents the Self, it would be akin to saluting the potential within each person. I would not use that greeting towards a person who did not acknowledge or accept the Satanic philosophy as the metaphor and appreciation would be completely lost. Have taste and class. 




 What in the world was that? No where in that interview did this Eric Freeman character say he was part of the ONA, just loosely referenced the Ceremony of Nine Angles, which is actually based on Lovecraft's mythos. Seems like the editors at Vice assumed this had to the with the ONA. Even the more rudimentary research into the ONA would show that they completely disavow any connection or history with the Church of Satan and the work of Anton LaVey. I believe they reference anything by LaVey as "watered down garbage".  Vice continues to live up to my summation of their "journalism": Fox News for hipsters. 




 As a student of Heidegger I've been recommended Sloterdijk's Sphere trilogy, just never got around to it. I can agree with his Satan-centric cosmology, and his view of technology as magic and metaphysics. Unfortunately there may be some important nuances lost in translation from the German, which causes much debate in Heidegger as well. Thanks for the link. 




 Here's an article by COS member Vexen Crabtree with details on the Four Crown Princes  
http://www.dpjs.co.uk/crownprinces.html 














 No hookers, but I know of a few financially successful Satanists who played professional poker and another who ran a well known adult film studio out of Vegas. 




 Oh, I forgot about that esoteric knowledge. Those deep Mysteries unknown to the sheep but revealed to the true kvlt after some fat lines of ketamine. 




 The names themselves and their various associations (cardinal points, elements, etc.) come from Judeo-Christian myths, LaVey elaborated on them with poetic fashion. 




 And this is exactly why [Peter Gilmore's article is titled the way it is](http://www.churchofsatan.com/lets-you-and-him-fight.php).

 Do we want to go down this road again? Who is "they" who serve to keep a "religion" pure? What is the "religion"? Do you mean heretical Christians? And don't give me that "esoteric" nonsense, it's a lame cop-out for "I have no idea" or "stuff I read online".  














 Because Satanism is a celebration of life, being your own personal god, and epicurean living. *Most* traditional Black Metal is obsessed with death, joylessness, and devil worship. There are, of course, exceptions. And something doesn't always need to be Satanic for a Satanist to enjoy it for their own purposes. 




 First of all, the Sigil of Baphomet is the symbol Anton LaVey established for the organized philosophy and religion of Satanism and the Church of Satan. So if you're talking about the Sigil of Baphomet you're talk about Satanism as defined by LaVey, not any form of "theistic" devil worship. Here is an article detailing the history of the Sigil of Baphomet, how it became incorporated in Satanism, and why.  

http://churchofsatan.com/history-sigil-of-baphomet.php  

As for the Four Crown Princes, this is entirely symbolic and metaphoric. It would be up to you to decide how you choose to negotiate them with the idea of Baphomet. 

How a devil worshiper who actually believes in the existence of these "forces" handles them, I have no idea. Especially considering how these terms existed in different, anthropologically incompatible mythologies. But that's a whole other *thing*. 




 I figured. That said, I do have a considerably large BM record collection and enjoy the music under certain conditions (Emperor   Thorns being some of my favorite bands). 















































































 [The Spanish translation of Peter H. Gilmore's S. Scriptures is now available as a hardback and slipcase.](http://shop.underworldamusements.net/category/satan)  


I've made this a text post instead of a link post so that I can follow-up with some disclosure and starting points for rational discussion, as opposed to just spamming a new book.  


*Disclosure: I've been an active member of the Church of Satan for 7 years and currently hold the title of Warlock within the organization. All this means is that the administration has taken note of real world accomplishments and applications of the Satanic philosophy. For about 10 years I've worked with a number of Satanists, independents and within the Church of Satan, on various projects ranging from organizing concerts, web development, proof reading and editing, and as a technical consultant. I put this out there due to the fact that I've seen posts that use sources like "my sister's ex-boyfriend's cousin who was once a Satanist" or decades old ex-members with bitter axes to grind.*  


That said, I cannot speak **for** the COS and its members as an entirety. But I am authorized to speak **to** the organization's functions and fundamental philosophies.


I've been lurking on this subreddit for about year and noticed Satanism/LaVey brought up several times, as recently as a few weeks ago. While many do understand that Satanism (notice I'm not using any prefixed qualifications) is based on an atheist principle, there still seem be a number of people who do not (or cannot) grasp that idea.  


Here are some experts from Gilmore's essay, What, The Devil?, which is [available online](http://www.churchofsatan.com/Pages/WhatTheDevil.html).  


"From a 1986 interview with Walter Harrington of The Washington Post:  


Satan is a symbol, nothing more, LaVey says. Satan signifies our love of the worldly and our rejection of the pallid, ineffectual image of Christ on the cross.  


Accepting the axiomatic premise that no gods exist as independent supernatural entities means that Satanists are de facto atheists. We know that the objective universe is indifferent to us. Since our philosophy is self-centered, each Satanist sees himself as the most important person in his life. Each individual thus generates his own hierarchy of values and judges everything based on his own standards. Therefore, we Satanists appoint ourselves as the Gods in our subjective universes."  


Here is Peter Gilmore discussing the issue on Point of Inquiry  
http://www.pointofinquiry.org/peter_h_gilmore_science_and_satanism/  


The other thing I see mentioned over and over is "it's just hedonism". No, Hedonism is ultimately compulsive. Peter Gilmore prefers to use the term Epicureanism.  


From the essay [Rebels Without Cause](http://www.churchofsatan.com/Pages/Rebels.html):  


"Satanists always remain in control of their exploration of pleasure. IndulgenceNOT compulsion is our founders dictum that moves us out of hedonism, which by definition is unbridled and thus compelled. Epicureanismthe balanced seeking of physical and mental self-satisfactionembraces a wider range of gratification. It is refined, selective, and embodies our concept of Indulgence. We are gourmets in the banquet of existence. Hedonism is limited to base carnal pursuits. Epicureans arent prudes, nor are we slaves to any of our desires; rather these are motivators toward seeking all manner of fulfilling experiences. The hedonist blindly sates his lusts for sex, sustenance, and somaconsequences be damned! That is a self-destructive course inappropriate for Satanists."  


While LaVey's work has been seminal to the Satanic philosophy, Peter Gilmore has been expounding on it for years, in terms and on topics that are applicable today. The Satanic Scriptures includes the essays linked above and others that have only been available those in the COS. Topics include same-sex marriage, the importance of a secular society, a clear explanation of Satanic magic, classical music, toy collections, politics, pragmatic eugenics, Godzilla, and more.  


If anyone has rational questions or needs clarifications please post them below. Do make an attempt to scroll through the comments and see if your question has been asked and answered.
