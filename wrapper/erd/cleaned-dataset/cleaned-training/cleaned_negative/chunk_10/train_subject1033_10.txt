 It's a sad day in America when anyone is still gullible enough to fall for either Ron or Rand Paul's stunts. 




 Yet another Libertarian man-child trying to act tough. 




 Maybe Rand can get a spot doing this on his Dad Ron's "THE END IS NEAR!!1!" infomercial scams after his presidential campaign collapses. 




 Phony political parties, such as "the Tea Party." 




 James Dobson's colon. 




 Then again, look how many fall for Alex Jones' bullshit. 




 Exactly. See the Cliven Bundy Militia/Jade Helm paranoids. 




 The GOP is already 4 or 5 separate parties, and the fissures continue to widen. 




 They're pretty much doing it to themselves. 




 And when a speaker at David Duke rallies (Rep. Steve Scalise, R-LA) is Republican Majority Whip. 




 And then he had his son drunkenly crash into it. 




 And what with that Jade Helm thing going on too, you know, it's better to be safe because those terrorists are some wily ones, you know? 









 Uh-oh. Reddit's White Supremacist/Neo-Confederate Downvote Militia isn't going to like this story one bit. 




 "far-right forced birth" is yet more accurate.

The forced birthers couldn't give a damn about the child after they've forced it into the world (or the pre-existing mother, it must be noted.)

Then, in their eyes, the mother and child they claim to so venerate become "welfare scum."



 









 *So Brave* 









 IOKIYAR 




 William F. Buckley is spinning in his grave. 




 Especially bold considering GWB's own military record. 




  The neo-cons have not gone away.

And they can still play right-wing social conservatives like fiddles.

 




 One million copies dropped from a sufficient height would definitely be enough to bust up a chiffarobe. 




 A few hand grenades for each of the security guards would help too. Then they can take out the evildoers should they hide behind statues and columns. 




 And that's just the way the Kochs and their ilk like it. 




 Establishment Republicans and their funders always make sure that they and their children don't do any of the fighting, bleeding, or dying in the wars they start.

That's where poor Republicans come in. The Establishment Republicans are happy to send the poor Republicans into the meat grinder if it means personal profit can be extracted.

I don't know how or why poor conservative voters keep falling for the lies the rich conservative plutocrats sell them. To rich Republicans, poor Republicans are little more than dung on their polo boots.

It's really just the same as the Civil War: wealth-extorting Plantation Owners and the Confederate Generals they funded sending poor white sharecroppers to die to for "the Cause." 




 I wonder what he thinks about his Dad's infomercials?

Maybe someone can locate him and ask.

 can Salon just be banned?

Why does the American Right always insist on censoring or banning anything with which they disagree?

Reddit is, by deliberate design, meant to be a haven for ***USER***-submitted, ***USER***-curated content.

Reddit was never meant to be "a place where reactionary right-wingers won't have to risk getting their poor widdle fee-fees hurt." Previous management of this very subreddit found out that censorship, user bans, and false appellations such as "Not US Politics," "Off Topic," and "Rehosted Content" only backfire. Most of those Mods are gone now. 

If you long for the comfort of a "Free Republic"-style echo chamber on reddit, try /r/conservative for one, where any mention of the Republicans' multi-decade ["Southern Strategy"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy) will get you flat-out banned.
 




 I love how the GOP just keeps painting itself further and further into the corner. 




 As always, it is important to note that *The New American* is the house publication of the John Birch Society.

The John Birch Society believed that both Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy were "active, willing agents of the International Communist Conspiracy."

They also believed that fluoridated water was a Communist plot designed to stupefy the American population and prepare us for the inevitable Communist invasion to destroy America and all she stands for.

It's not at all difficult to see the parallels between the John Birch Society and other more recent movements on today's reactionary right.

See the "Jade Helm" paranoia, for one, in which Chinese soldiers are supposed to emerge from newly-dug tunnels beneath shuttered Wal-Marts to take over the United States.  




 Republicans are quickly losing the wedge issues they've exploited for decades. 




 He's down in his Dad's bunker, shotgun across lap, waiting for the invasion of the Washington Machine.  




 Nonetheless, if we can get those delegates together for Rand, he'll win the Republican nomination at a brokered convention. And so:

MONEYBOMB!

END THE MEDIA SILENCE! 




 Or you're a paranoid.

It's more likely than you think. 




 If they had inherited hundreds of millions in the 1970s? Yes, just about anyone *could* have "amass[ed] a fortune" of $10 billion, given that quantity of capital and *four decades* to grow it.

The Kochs' John-Bircher founding Dad left them hundreds of millions in the 1960s. Same story, but they've had *five decades.* 




 Is this "bomb bomb bomb, bomb bomb Iran"-McCain we're talking about? 




 Why would you anyone want to eliminate their own ability to vote for candidates they like, and who are good at their jobs?

Term limits = lazy democracy. If you want someone out, vote them out.

If you want to be a spiteful cuss, please don't take your sadism out on your fellow American voters by trying to limit their choices at the ballot box. 




 But even when "responsible gun owners" *do* do something stupid with their guns, they are often still lionized by the pro-gun crowd.

Witness the cult of shitposters that sprung up around George Zimmerman and celebrated him for "takin' out that thug."
 




 It's the Gunbertarian Downvote Militia. They're extremely active on reddit.

It's like reading Yahoo News comments with a healthy dollop of Free Republic/Breitbart users thrown in.

They've managed to convince themselves that the "Muslim Kenyan Usurper" is coming to get their guns. 




 [He's lookin' like a fool with his pants on the ground.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMwhl4IrPNc) 




 Bingo. Same with abortion. 




 And a very small bumpersticker:

 And 100% of forced-birth wingnut warriors are outraged that 99% of women don't regret their abortions. 




  I'm sick of seeing democrats demonize Christianity 

The democrats haven't demonized Christianity. What an odd charge.


 




  The truth is that a lot of people respect Trump for being a "straight talker"

That's also what people said about Ross Perot. Glad we dodged that bullet.
 




 See Stephen King's *The Dead Zone.* 




 Trump fans tend to be simpletons, so it fits. 




 Do you actually believe that crap, or are you just repeating what they've trained you to think on Fox News/AM radio? 




 Donald Trump is the living caricature of everything the Republican Party has stood for since the 1980s.

So are his fans: "He's a billionaire, so he must be doin' sumptin' right." 




 But... but... Ron Paul, Peter Schiff, and Glenn Beck all told me to buy gold! None of them would ever lie to me! 




 "The New American" is the house magazine of the John Birch Society. 




 What an attention whore 




  Prosser is the justice who was witnessed strangling one of his fellow justices because *she disagreed with him.*

I can't believe this was swept under the rug. No doubt some of the high-powered right-wing donors who have taken over Wisconsin greased some palms to make that incident go away, just as they did with this one.

The "War on Women" waged by Republicans and the American Right continues, no matter how many times they dismiss or scoff at the idea.  




 At least one Red State Governor out there is no longer willing to watch his own state's citizens suffer and die because Republicans want to spite the President.

What are the odds of other Red State Governors following his admirable lead?

 




 What I mean, more specifically, is the subdivision within the Republican coalition which Establishment Republicans lead.

At best, the Wall Street/Country Club Wing of the Republicans humors (a better word might be "tolerates") the single-issue 'morals' voters -- but *only* because they bring the votes. Once any of those "moral planks" starts costing them votes, they dump it.

The Wall Street/Country Club Wing of the Republicans couldn't care less about the social issues, but they are happy to exploit rage over them to win the votes of a population that, were it not for these id-tapping rage issues, would have no objective reason for to voting Republican.

For example: the Republicans have lost on marriage equality. They can't continue to rant about "the homosexual agenda" and be taken seriously. They know this.

That leaves only a few single-issue wedges they can still reliably exploit for votes, one of which is abortion.

On abortion: the Republican Party has no intentions whatsoever of banning abortion, despite all of their rhetoric over the decades. Anyone who votes for Republicans on that issue should abandon all hope. The Republicans had the Presidency, a solid majority on the Supreme Court, and full control of Congress for the majority of the Bush/Cheney Era (2001-2009.) Yet they did nothing on abortion. (They did, however, try to kill off Social Security in their 2nd term.)

To sum up, the Republicans will continue to play single-issue anti-abortion voters until their tactics alienate more voters than they attract, just as they did with by exploiting the fear and rage of their anti-LGBT wing for the past 15-20 years.
 




 It's worked quite well for abstinence-only advocate Bristol Palin.
 




  If they really believe a fetus is a life

...then they'd support a generous post-birth social support network to care for the consequences of their ideology, rather than seek the elimination of such public assistance.

 




 As a self-anointed "speaker for the unborn," *what makes you so sure they'd want you to speak for them?

Do you have any special skills that qualify you to act as a ventriloquist for "the unborn"?


What if "the unborn" found you horribly annoying and wanted you to STFU?




 




 Translation: the Kochs greased some palms to get the investigation killed. 




 It's one of the few right-wing rage/wedge issues that still has any effect.

Mark my words: the Republicans will gleefully shove the "pro life" voters under the bus the *instant*  they realize that this wedge issue they've exploited for 40 years is costing them votes.

If anyone out there is still foolish enough to believe that the Republicans are about "honoring a Culture of Life," don't say you weren't warned when the Party dumps you and all of "God's Littlest Angels" like a used condom. 




 If Trump can't make it as a Republican, here's hoping he runs as an independent/third party candidate.

;) 




 I guess it's because Texas politicians love the Constitution so much.

 Seriously, this should have taken all of a couple hours.

 Tell me why I love you like I do. 




 Were all other magazines wrong when they published cover stories on  Bin Laden, or Timothy McVeigh, or the Unabomber, or Dylann Roof?

I don't get the selective anger at Rolling Stone. It's always seemed like a self-created talking point for the permanent "THIS IS AN OUTRAGE!!!" media outlets to exploit. 




 Huh huh. You said "cum." 




 It sounds like a roller derby team. 




 Why do so many descendants of the poor white sharecroppers (who were sent to die by rich white Plantation Owners in their Cotton War) still celebrate the Confederacy? 

I'm convinced it's because these poor whites have never really stopped to think about what and whom their ancestors were actually fighting for.

The Plantation Owners (and their latter-day apologists) invented all of these "Southern Pride! Honor! Heritage! War of Northern Aggression!" distractions to keep the Southerners of the time and their modern descendants from realizing the truth: ***the Plantation Owners viewed the lives of the poor white sharecroppers as worth EVEN LESS than their African slaves.***

Let's restate that to make sure it's even more clear: ***the Plantation Owners viewed the lives of their of African slaves as inherently MORE VALUABLE than of the landless white peasants they sent to die.*** 

*The Confederate Battle Flag is nothing more a sign of their own exploitation  that of poor, landless, Southern whites beneath the very same Plantation Owners and Slavers that the slaves were forced to suffer under.*

So why do so many of the descendants of these poor, landless, sharecropping whites sent to die in the Confederate-initiated Civil War *still* celebrate the symbols of the Confederacy as if it were something of which to be proud? Why continue honor those "Rebel Heroes" who sent their very own families to die for profit?

Yet they'll still run around claiming "Pride! Honor! Heritage!," even thought it was those same bogus "Pride! Honor! Heritage!" lies that sent their own ancestors to the grave in defense of the slaves (and most importantly,  the profits the slaves generated for Southern Aristocrats.) There's nothing remotely "honorable" about that.
 




 Oh really? The Confederates "returned" Fort Sumter to the United States?

Or did they invade it, occupy it, and then use the very cannons and munitions they also stole from the United States to fire upon United States ships?

Stormfront or Free Republic devotees might fall for such Confederate revisionism, so don't be surprised if you find no takers when you try to market such Confederate apologia here. 




 Most of the South freaked out and abandoned the United States months before Lincoln was even sworn in as President.

It wasn't Lincoln's fault that Plantation Owners were raging paranoids. 

Nor was it the fault of all the poor white Southern sharecroppers sent by the Plantation Owners  to die to protect the slaves in the fields. Do you know what that means? It means that all of the Confederate Ownership Class placed a greater value on the lives of their black African slaves than of lives native white Southerners.

It's always confused me why so many poor Southern whites still proudly wave the Confederate flag  the very symbol of the Plantation Owners that sent all their great-great-grandpappys to die  in order to protect the slaves and the profits they brought to said Owners.

The rich whites of the South kept all the money; the poor whites did all the fighting and dying for their White Masters.  It's not as if they had a choice. "Go fight in my Cotton War or get shot for desertion."

That's why the rich, Plantation-owning whites had to invent all this "Southern Liberty! Heritage! Honor!" horseshit: to distract the poor whites from realizing they were being used as fucking cannon fodder. Some, as we've seen, even fall for that old load of crap *today,* 150 years after the fact.

Yep, those Confederates and Plantation Owners sure were heroes! Why do so many poor Southern whites continue to celebrate the "Heritage" of the Southern Elites who sent their own families to die? 




 Did the Confederates make any effort to compensate the United States for all of the Federal property they stole?

Who violated the "Non-Aggression Principle" here?

This is the question Confederate apologists *always* refuse to answer (at least honestly.) 




  If they feel like their identity is being purposefully eradicated, even moderate Southerns like myself would shake hands with the KKK and agree to a temporary pact of mutual benefit against the Outsiders.

And if their "feelings" are the result of paranoia? 

even moderate Southerns like myself would shake hands with the KKK and agree to a temporary pact of mutual benefit against the Outsiders.

Imagine the Pay-Per-View audience! I'd bet Americans would pay a lot to watch potential McVeighs and Bundys and Roofs get what they seem to so desperately seek.

 




 Nazi flags too. There's a strong Aryan Nations/White Supremacist/Sovereign Citizen Militia presence in Idaho.

I don't understand the reflexive support for distant and failed causes, but many are clearly receptive to it.



 




 I hope all those Patriots!^TM and Liberty-Lovers!^TM busy keepin' us safe from TYRANNY!^TM don't leave their potato salad sitting out in the sun for too long.

 "Liberty University" (founded by Jerry Falwell) and "Regent University" (rebranded from the original "Oral Roberts University") are nothing but diploma mills for right-wing Evangelical Christians.

It's amazing the number of Bush/Cheney Administration hires who had "degrees" from these phony diploma mills.

 More Republicans voting Libertarian would be *very* good for America.

I encourage this practice strongly. ;) 




 I think I may have heard that phrase... isn't it "Southern Plan" or something similar? "Strategies for the South," maybe?

I know that to utter the dread phrase (whatever it is, precisely) earns one an instant ban from certain "conservative" subreddits.

It must be a *very* dangerous idea for them to fear even its mere mention.

 




 Damn those lib'ruls and their free-spendin' Big Gub'mint ways!

THOSE ARE OUR TAXES! *OUR TAXES!*

 




 Or, very simple: they'd just starve out and die. Natural selection at work.

Libertarian Alert! 




 This is an excellent point. The Southern slave states were *always* trying to game the system, even from the very beginning. There was never any consistency to their arguments beyond the naked financial interests of Planation Owners.

"Well, no, they can't *vote,* of course, but we have to take care of them at our expense. Shouldn't they count as least as *partial* people for our the representation of our fair state? We know what's best for them anyway, so of course we'll vote in their interests!"

See also the American Right's continuing efforts to suppress and complicate participation in elections for those voters they denote as undesirable. 




 An uncomfortable truth for Confederate apologists, and their modern-day descendants and defenders:

***The Plantation Owners cared far less about the lives of the poor white sharecroppers than they did their African slaves.*** That's why they sent the poor whites to die on the battlefield. That's got to be a bitter pill to swallow, and the entire "Southern Identity" movement is centered on a collective refusal to acknowledge that simple truth.

"PRIDE!" and "HONOR!" and "HERITAGE!" had nothing whatsoever to do with it. Initiating and waging a war against the United States was an economic decision to make the South's fat and happy Plantation Owners fatter and happier, and they used the bodies and blood and limbs of the South's poor whites to do it.

The Confederate Leadership/Plantation Owners sent hundreds of thousands of poor white sharecroppers into a meat grinder because their sole goal was to keep their cotton profits rolling in, and that required safe, healthy slaves to harvest it. And poor, landless whites had no choice but to go war to defend the slaves who generated the cotton profits which kept the Plantation Owners and Confederate funders going.

So why do so many of the descendants of these poor white victims continue to lionize the engineers of their own families' death and destruction? In a way, weren't these poor white sharecroppers used by the rich white Plantation Owners/Profiteers used as pawns and slaves themselves?

There is one difference: the newly-Americanized slaves never worshipped their Confederate oppressors as heroes and role models. Poor whites who still defend the "Lost Cause" and believe the lie of "the War of Northern Aggression" have spent 150 years venerating the very Plantation Owners who sent their great-great-grandpappies to die to preserve and expand their personal profit.

These aren't ideas that Confederate apologists like to entertain, as if they think about it too hard they are forced to realize that they, like the slaves, were ***utterly used,*** and, very ***unlike*** the descendants of slaves, still continue to the lick the boots of those who sent their ancestors to die (even now, 150 years later.)

If so many poor American whites weren't fixated on maintaining this toxic "At least I'm bettr'n *you*" attitude toward poor Americans of other races, all could realize that, if united, have far more interests in common than they would ever expect.

American conservative leadership can *never* allow this realization to take place, or their uneasy coalition of the past 40+ years collapses from beneath them.

And the power of the "Southern Strategy" (employed so successfully by the American Right ever since Richard Nixon) is fading.





 




 Nearly four decades on, many of the most foolish of all voters (the "Reagan Democrats") are finally realizing they got played for suckers.

Some are still falling for the schtick.
 




 The Religious Right couldn't give less of a damn for either mother or child post-birth.

Always remember: they are not "pro-life"  they are *forced birth.* 









 It's getting harder and harder for the GOP to hide what it is, and for whom their dog-whistles are designed. 




 Limbaugh's colon. 




 Hey, he was the one who decided that 2016 was going to be his year and had gastro surgery a couple years back as prep.

Screaming Republican jackasses do well on Fox and AM radio, but that's about it. He's going for the post-"I ran for President" contracts. 




 Yes, as in when she insisted on buying a failing PC-clone company (Compaq) and duplicated HP's existing PC-clone business.

 I really don't understand how/why the Pauls were ever taken seriously by anyone.

It's been one long grift since the first newsletter, and yet they only defend the Paul family all the more.

Is there a classification in the DSM-V that deals with this sort of thing? 




 See? 




 The thing about PaulBots? They always insist upon having the last word.   




 No, it's about ***Paul*** saying it. Otherwise it would have never been posted by his apologists in an attempt to say "See? He's not racist, and neither is his Dad!"

Didn't work for Ron, won't work for Rand.

Everyone knows about the Pauls and their history. Those who do and continue to defend either of them know exactly what they're speaking for and who they're speaking to. 

As I said, this isn't the 19th century anymore. The Paul and their fellow Confederates can't get away with this shit anymore.

But it's certainly clear it won't stop their zealots from trying.

 




 This thread isn't about the Drug War. It's about Paul-pologists trying to hide the Paul Family Legacy.

Didn't work in 1988, didn't work in 2008, didn't work in 2012, not going to work in 2016.

Sorry. The 19th century is over. 




  Otherwise, I just don't care.

Obviously.

 




 Then they should be happy to publicly stand by their supporters in the Aryan Nations, Sovereign Citizen, and Militia movements, shouldn't they? 

Why are the Pauls so afraid to publicly acknowledge their base? (See Rand's surreptitious meeting with Cliven Bundy about "Nevada state sovereignty.")

Calling attention to relevant facts is not a logical fallacy, no matter how much one would like to pretend it is.

Arguing it is of little use if one is a "true believer" in the Pauls and their phony "R*EVOL*UTION." Those who still support the Pauls after the extremist right-wing, paranoid conspiracy crap the Paul Family has squeezed out for decades tells us a lot about their alignments, their sanity, and likely both.
 




 Calling out candidates like Ron and Rand Paul, who have decades-long ties to White Supremacists and Confederate apologists, is not a "logical fallacy."

Anyone who doesn't know the history of the Paul family and its sympathizers is certainly not well-versed enough in recent American politics to engage in an intelligent discussion.

And even worse are those who *do* know the Paul Family's history, and continue to support them.

 




 I bet the 'facial strategy' worked far better for the Republicans in the convention center's Men's rooms.

*[tap tap tap]* 




 Why criticize me? The Paul Family has poisoned their own name far beyond anyone's ability to defame it.

[Lest we forget.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEC68vTQwP8)

And as everyone with even the most basic knowledge of current American politics knows, there is a ***LOT*** more where this came from. 




 I remember how the Republicans got him to singlehandedly fund the "Recall Gray Davis" petitions to the tune of $1.7 million. He was foolish enough to think that the California GOP would actually let him run for Governor of California.

Don't let them get away with it. Our nation needs you. 




 It's surprising that that shitty right-wing fantasy novel hasn't received more attention, given all of the havoc that it's inspired.

That book is where a lot of their "the gub'mint is a-gonna come git mah gunzzz!!1!" and "the coming race war" and "let's nuke the Jews!!1!" fantasies came from.

"The Order" in Denver used it to justify bank robberies and murdering liberal talk show hosts. Timothy McVeigh used it as a model while planning his domestic terrorist attack on Oklahoma City. The Bundy Militia are also big fans.

In case anyone doesn't know what were talking about, *The Turner Diaries* is a novel by a White Supremacist (under a pseudonym, of course) that right-wing domestic terrorists have viewed as an instruction manual for nearly 4 decades now.

Here's the wikipedia entry on it, which is a good start but doesn't nearly capture the poor writing and bizarre conspiracy theories which have come to define the modern American Right:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Turner_Diaries

 




 Pat Buchanan is the man who convinced Ron Paul to act as a "top economic advisor" to the Buchanan campaign in 1992 instead of running for the Republican nomination (as Paul had originally planned) on the heels of Paul's failed 1988 Libertarian presidential bid.

Ron Paul discusses this in his ridiculous, racist newsletters. Birds of a feather, I suppose. 




 ... and their "Uh, I have a bad back" disability payments.

(Funny addendum: Pat Buchanan got out of Vietnam with "a bad knee." This, however, didn't stop him from taking up jogging in 1992 when he sought the Republican presidential nomination 25 years after the fact.) 




 Until right-wing domestic terrorists start setting up roadside IEDs.

 




 Is it TeaBaggery? 




  Yep, this was also the exact target demographic for the KKK in the 20th century.

And Fox/AM radio's target demographic for today.

 




  this very small minority of southern crazies is literally making the entire south look bad

The same could be said of all the poor, white, landless soldiers that the Plantation Owners deliberately sent to die in order to protect their cotton wealth.

Instead, the descendants of those sent to die by Cotton Profiteers still fall for this "Pride and Heritage" bullshit invented by the Plantation Class to justify sending their great-great grandfathers to die to preserve the "Lost Cause."

Here's something for members of White Wing of today's right-wing to think about: *the lives of poor whites meant even less to the Plantation Owners than did the lives of their African slaves.*

And yet, these poor, angry White Supremacists *still,* even after 150 years, wave the banner of their own forefathers' death and oppression at the hands of the Southern Slavers as if it something of which to be proud.

 They aren't "pro life"; they're "forced birth."

Just look at how much regard they have for "the Sanctity of Life" after birth. Then, both mother and child are dismissed as "welfare scum" and cast away.

Based on their attitudes, I often wonder if these "Christians" are following who they think they are. 




 Crunchy Frog. 




  it's when major retailers and such start getting scared and politically correct and end up pulling related products from their shelves and banning their sale of such products on their websites even by private sellers. It's basically back-door censorship disguised as political correctness.

Another way to look at it: the Free Market has spoken!

 




 The corrupt Mods themselves specifically used that language. 




 And this is what led to grossly unscrupulous Mods banning users with a de facto shadowban, all the while lying "Mods have no power to ban users. Only Admins can do that."

Then they banned anyone they felt like. 




 The "de facto shadowban" problem on Reddit is greater than has been widely acknowledged.

A couple of years back, some remnants of the Ron Paul/Cliven Bundy/"LIBERTY!!1!"^TM crowd engineered a takeover at certain news and politics subreddits, then started flat-out banning users, content, and publications that they disagreed with.

Hopefully such Mod Frauds will be swiftly dealt with in the future.
