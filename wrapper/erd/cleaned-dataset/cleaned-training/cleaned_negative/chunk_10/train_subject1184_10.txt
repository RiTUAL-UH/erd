 I finished the first chapter of Infinite Jest (Year Of Glad) and I didnt't understand anything.It's not about language,it's about the plot.I simply didn't understand what is going on. 




 Well,I read 49 in my native language.It's the only Pynchon novel that translated into Turkish.I've hardly found GR and it's English.So,I can't read V at this moment. 




 wow,this looks amazing but i'll miss malvo. 




 Why do you consider GR as a difficult book? Because of the language or because of the plot? 




 I've read Crying Of Lot 49 and I loved it.It was an amazing book.
