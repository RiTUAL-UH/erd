 Additionally, is there an easy template for Soviet style Socialist emblems? I know those aren't true heraldry, but where else am I going to ask that? Thanks in advance! 




 I thought Nazis were supposed to be stylish. This is as ugly as their poor, bigoted hearts.  




 Huh. Here I was thinking it was a LAW. 




 I always found his story to be more sad than anything. That said, medical science is a window to all sorts of terrifying things. Your body can fuck shit up for pretty much no reason. 




 What does webdesignsem.com have to do with this? Please note that if this is some kind of advertising, we'll remove it. 




 Disabled guy, here. Pretty sure that counts as some form of negligence, if you really wanted to press it. If your bruising requires any sort of medical assistance, the airport staff will probably be more than happy to help you track her down and have her made responsible for medical expenses. 




 Nothing. It's been removed. 




 Yeah, I'm removing it. 




 I assure you, as a mod, that we can say fuck here. 









 They've got Cave Johnson running a razor company now. 




 Well, it's getting downvoted. You probably won't see it on the front page. 




 Oh! Oh! Is it because you only bring near beer? I bet that's it. 




 And also, John Hurt. 




 I suppose I meant *technically* plausible, not *philosophically* plausible. Who knows if mankind will ever build a transporter? Not I. However, everyone sleeps... Well... [Nearly everybody.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatal_familial_insomnia) 




 I find it to be a more plausible version of the Transporter Problem, if you're at all familiar with that. 




 Isn't this what the ancient Egyptians believed about sleep? Or was that the Australian Aboriginals? 




 Oversector 3 reading positive noncontact, uh... Recommend three subsumations. Cauterize and clamp. Huhuhuh. 




 Agreed. Not NSFW, but the flashing lights could be cause for caution around epileptics. Thus, the added flair. 









 It would be harsh, but civilization *would* continue. Whether or not we'd want what humanity turns into to continue is another matter. 




 Not necessarily! I hear there's this glowing shit underground. Imulsion, they call it. It's basically garbage, but I bet we could make something of it! With no ill consequences! 




 Greetings, fellow WASR. Hope you enjoy your new AK! Happy plinking for GLORIOUS RODINU. 




 Where are you at on guns? As guns are the guarantor of proletarian liberty, any restrictions on firearms will lose you my vote. 




 Made for export.  




 Or they just went around harvesting flowers for people or something. Maybe they were laborers? 




 So much so, that's it's got a flimsy LED shovel and is preparing to make glow in the dark dirt once the barrel gives way. 









 That is disappointing. I like to give people the benefit of a doubt, but you can't fight for the oppressed if you're nursing your own bigotry and prejudices. 




 Do we know who runs their Facebook page? Perhaps his opinion isn't shared by the rest of his organization.

Incidentally, while Huey P Newton was pro LGB, his statement didn't mention trans folk. Do we have any sort of citation on his opinion on trans issues? 




 I would be surprised if Scientology didn't somehow have capital to leverage against anybody who owns billboards in Clearwater. Seems like they're the sorts who would defend their home turf. 




 The handy dandy notebook is the GULAG system

The clues are kulaks, accused capitalists, and Finns

and the solved mystery at the end is the electrification of the Soviet Union and the destruction of Nazi Germany.
Karma plz. 




 Billboard advertising is dreadful, no matter the subject matter. This is mildly preferable. 




 They sling the best sugar on carpenter ant turf. 




 Gun owners are already subject to rather harsh background checks. The supposed solution to this, requiring checks for private sales, risks straying into some rather overbearing territory. The best response, I feel, is to make private sellers culpable for crimes committed by those who they make straw purchases for. 

But really, the Confederate flag and guns aren't problems, here. The issue is and always will be this nation's horrible approach to mental health care. 




 I think it's something that would like to echo the style, as a complement to it but not necessarily an example of it, you know? It's the sort of thing one might call Neo Deco or something. 









 Well, until the findings of NASA's sciences lead us reeling into the seclusion of a new dark age.  









 That would be nice. Why it isn't already a de jure independent state is beyond me. Seems like everyone would be better off if it were. 




 I always make sure I'm kind to call center workers. From experience, I can say that they've got it the worst. 

Unless they're telemarketers. Because fuck telemarketers. 




 Maybe I should. I imagine the quantity would have to be large enough that the plasma grenades would generate their own gravitational field. The XKCD guy would have a field day drawing that. The math should prove pretty interesting, too. 




 A lot of conservatives see the country as slipping away from them. By pandering to the very fringe, Trump is keeping this group quite happy and has their rapt attention. I can't imagine that anybody close to center would still be having much to do with the GOP. Thus, they would not be participating in Republican polls. 




 And somehow he's regarded as a financial genius. Absolute proof that life's not fair. 




 Trump's businesses cripple themselves. No cartel help needed. 




 It goes necrotic due to horrible dick parasites and just sort of falls off one day.

EDIT: Horrible Dick Parasites would be a great name for a band. 




 I'd imagine so. But supposing that practicality and logistics weren't obstacles... 




 Asking for a friend of a friend.

Bonus round: how many fragmentation grenades for the same task?

Lightning round: how many Scorpion tank shells? 




 It'd be one hell of a coincidence if it wasn't. 




 Of course, everyone knows that. But that doesn't help much when trying to develop an overall feel for the story and the events within it.  




 I always thought that to be Prothean in nature, but that was at the time and I guess now that I think about it, it doesn't fit their MO. Neither does it fit the MO of Reapers however, who only go after spacefaring civilizations. 




 I'm accepting this as headcanon until something comes along to disprove it. 




 It's a great hobby and I believe that everybody has the right to defend themselves. Whenever I see a chance to spread what little knowledge of guns I have, I take it.  




 I mean, hypothetically speaking, if somebody had the capital to make these things, what would the legal side of it be? I assume the IPs are all Russian state property, and I have no idea how the US government or the ATF would deal with that when approving the firearms for sale on the general market. That said, how does one even claim to have gotten the designs. You can't tell them you threw the thing together from illicitly imported parts. Maybe claim you downloaded the specs online? Or maybe you're working on original plans reverse engineered from photos and previous AK designs? 




 They were $80 earlier in the decade. I mean, now they're up around $250, which is substantially more than I thought they were, but that's still cheaper than US prices. [Here's one for $220](http://www.grouseriver.com/Soviet-SKS-Semi-Auto-7-62x39-Rifle) and [another for $200 on a seller I've heard mentioned highly.](http://www.marstar.ca/dynamic/product.jsp?productid=85526)

More products to make an American like me jealous?

[How about a Chinese M14? Half its US price.](http://www.marstar.ca/dynamic/product.jsp?productid=85814)

[Chinese Army handguns? Got 'em!](http://www.marstar.ca/dynamic/category.jsp?catid=85812)

[Genuine USSR Tokarevs for $200! Compared to $3-400 US on the off chance you can even find one!](http://www.marstar.ca/dynamic/product.jsp?productid=81898)

[A Browning M2, if you've got $5000 and a Prohibited license for some reason.](http://www.marstar.ca/dynamic/product.jsp?productid=75108)

But then, the RCMP makes me almost thankful to have the ATF and your licensing system is a bit restrictive for my tastes, so I guess it evens out. Point is, if you want guns in Canada, there are options. Oh, and if you're after AKs, I hear unrestricted CZ-58s are due back in production. 




 I had a Marui FAMAS and some AEGs by Echo(?) for a while. Also, gun ownership in Canada isn't *too* bad. I mean, y'all get dirt cheap SVTs and SKSs, so it's not all awful. I mean, the RCMP keeps some really awful gun laws in effect from what I hear, but there are a number of things up there to be envious of. You can still get stuff from Norinco, for example. We can't. I am keenly envious of that one. Still, if you ever find yourself in the states and want to shoot an AK, tons of folks over on /r/ak47 and /r/firearms have them and I'm sure would let you shoot. I myself own one, but I'm quite a ways away from the Canadian border. 




 Cugir doesn't run the tightest arsenal in the world. I mean, they're not African hellhole bad, but they're not world class either. I still love my WASR, though. 




 Not really. I bought my WASR in 2010 and it had much the same stock set on it. 









 Chinese AKs are actually pretty highly regarded. I'd rate them in the same tier as Soviet AKs, personally. At least the AKs from the Polytech and Norinco factories.  Anyway, judging from [this picture](http://i.imgur.com/bcU8AkL.jpg), it looks like their full sized AKs at least use compatible furniture and the bottom handguard retainer even looks to be close to spec. If I were still into airsoft, I'd likely pick one of these up. I don't think they were around when I played. If they were, I hadn't heard of them.  




 From that first screen shot, it looks like actual 74U wood might fit it. If you're keen on trying the real thing, they look like [this](https://www.k-var.com/shop/KR-404BT.html). I can't seem to find them for under $50, though, so you might want to have a look at your handguards for comparison. 




 SEGA might actually be the best place for them. They've been pretty good about letting external devs they own make decent games without fuckery from the central offices. Maybe have them snap up some key Kojima Productions personnel and a couple of IPs and see what they can do with it.

Just don't put them to work on Sonic. That franchise is where fun goes to die. 




 Is that real wood on there? Did you use an actual 74 foregrip? I ask because I have some AK furniture lying around after replacing the wood on my WASR and a friend of mine hates the polymer on his AEG. 




 Yeah, most people sort of stopped using it. I guess it's for the best, but there are certainly worse flags that have been rehabilitated.  




 Gotta go... fat? 




 I'll have to do that. I'm on something of a funk kick at the moment (Parliament and Stevie Wonder, mostly) but once that's over, it could be time for some metal. 




 That's the practice. I've read up on capitalism and I've read up on Communism. The best I can figure is that the market is pure chaos and neither theory on running an economic system can lead to much good for the common man.  




 I had completely missed that point, somehow. Thanks for pointing it out! 




 You're like the eighth person to say this. We clearly need to label it. Putting labels on the smokes clearly did wonders to stop people smoking. If we do something similar to high sugar foods, it might help with our runaway obesity problem. There's literally no reason not to. 




 I should listen to more metal, then. I know *of* Pantera, but I don't necessarily *know* Pantera. 




 Ideally, yes. However, corporate croney capitalism serves to drive prices in a direction that benefits share holders and executives, not necessarily the consumer or the masses. Couple this with the excess wealth of corporate America going to buy elected officials and you have a dysfunctional brand of capitalism that rivals Soviet "Communism" for its sheer harm to the average man. 




 With our obesity rate what it is? Absolutely.  




 The Nordics have their problems, but by and large a mixed market seems to be the best way of doing things. 




 Plausible. After all, *everybody* knows that Charon is a [Mass Relay.](http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Charon_Relay) 




 I think a lot of it is down to insurance driving up the cost. It's one of those cases where everyone knows they can get more and more with the system set up the way it is, so they keep charging more and more. It's all relatively fine if you've got an insurance plan that covers prescriptions, but if you need something over the counter or you're uninsured, you're up shit creek without a paddle. 




 Why not just show the sugar? Hardly anybody is willing to do that and it could - and should - be so plainly shown on the label. I think the public has shown that they'd like things stated as plainly as possible. 




 Your body actually does need sugar, to an extent. We just get waaaaaaaaaay too much of it since it's added to damn near everything. 




 I disagree here. For full disclosure, my girlfriend works and has worked in pharmaceutical development and while a LOT of it is down to skeezy business practices and lobbying, developing medicine is a risky and expensive process. I, for one, would much rather have it be a nationalized process and remove it from the shady morality inherent to anything that's done under profit motives, but as long as medicine is a capitalist enterprise it's going to be at least a little expensive. 




 FDA's been fucked for years. You know the reason why the percentage of your daily recommended sugar intake provided by a serving of food isn't shown on the Nutrition Facts? Corporate goddamn kickbacks. The FDA and their corporate masters are literally killing our country. 




 Looks like if Skynyrd did prog rock. I want one. 




 Woah, is this Hail Corporate or /r/frugal_jerk? 




 An employee or owner could have made the video with his kid. I'd imagine an ad agency could have done it more subtly. The logo is much too well framed to be anything but an ad.

Besides, they could be aiming to be a local landmark or something. I dunno. 




 Cincinnati isn't exactly a small market, and this was posted on two other subs. Anyway, my gut says nobody would give a shit about framing the logo in their shot that well unless they wanted to promote the brand. The kid was in the bottom of the shot for half the gif. Feels like an ad to me, hoss. 




 I'd buy one of these in a heartbeat. The fudd in me hopes a wooden option would be made available. 




 I'm really liking the STI Detonics gun, as well. It seems reliable, it's got a steel frame (which I think is better for a variety of reasons) and the look of the things just screams "this is an American handgun." I would love to see it make the cut, but we all know that the M9 will once again remain just out of sheer stubbornness. 




 A museum and people's homes. I wouldn't bring mine out in public or wear it or anything (I also think wearing the American flag on anything but a patch is tacky, mind you) but people should still be able to display it as they sit fit if they're private citizens. I mean, they should also be expected to either be avoided or have lengthy conversations about the thing, but if you only have it at a place where close friends will see it then it shouldn't be an issue. 




 This should be interesting to see. 




 That's my feeling. I, too, am a white male from the South; albeit not especially conservative. To me the flag represents the army that many of my ancestors served and a lot of positive aspects of Southern culture - the Dukes of Hazzard and Lynyrd Skynyrd, for example. That said, it was used by an army that propped up a racist regime and therefore has no place in any setting funded by tax dollars or wherein the functions of government might occur. I can completely understand how it makes black people uncomfortable. What the South needs is a new flag. 




 Hope you don't mind, but I crossposted this at /r/nocontext.  














 How in the blue hell has nobody mentioned The Alan Parsons Project's I Robot?  




 That sounds amazing.  




 In many areas, there are group homes and care centers; often times with a level of state support depending on your country and jurisdiction. In a lot of cases, however, the kid and the parent are shit out of luck. 




 As a disabled person, no. Even without mental retardation - which is, alone, an enormous burden on parents - medical costs and care considerations for physically disabled children are particularly burdensome. Not everyone is up to such a task.  




 Looks like ticks. 

EDIT: Oh, wait. Those are flies. Maybe some of the smaller ones are ticks? In any case, i was wrong.

 There's something mildly profane about advertising in public places. It always makes me feel like I've got no choice but to be pitched to if I see that tripe while I'm going down the sidewalk or the freeway. When they invent a way to block this shit with augmented reality glasses or something, I'll be so happy. 




 Not too hard, not too soft. 




 If KotOR and KotOR II don't somehow get reintegrated, I'm going to be a bitter old man some day. 




 Yeah, this might just be clickbait. That said, it's a pretty good reimagining of the Facility theme. 




 It won't. Having worked retail, I can tell you that the reason you get bugged so much in stores is down to the fact that it's a loss prevention tactic. The theory goes that by directing your employees to talk to customers, many of the ones that would shoplift would be too spooked and will be much less likely to steal inventory. 




 Well sure, but the 5.45 has a little hollow chamber in it that causes some gnarly wound cavitation. It also tends to go to pieces. 




 Is it true that Russia somehow isn't a party to the convention on post impact wounding munitions? I've heard this regarding the wound ballistics of the 5.45mm and several bits of Spetsnaz kit.  




 The Clone Wars ruined a lot of things. I'm pretty bummed that it's still canon, to be honest.

It'll always be Korriban to me, dammit.  




 I would assume some sort of recycler. We have the technology now. I assume by Mass Effect times, it would be small enough to pack into N7/galactic spaceman combat armor and most militaries worth a damn would have developed training protocols for getting people past the ick factor. 




 If it's getting upvoted, the subscribers of /r/russia obviously want to see it. If I was in the mods' position, I wouldn't remove it. 




 HOLY SHIT YES! Thank you so much! You're my hero right now, for real. 




 Russian army

I'm actually somewhat well versed in the Donbass conflict as I've done some research and discussion with people over there. Everybody I've talked to on the DPR and LPR side seems to be a local who really, genuinely dislikes the Ukraine and is quite displeased with the Maidan, so to call it a Russian invasion is incredibly disingenuous. 

But that's another discussion entirely.

As for the crimes of the Soviets, none of this is news to me. But that's how all hegemonies act. If the Soviets were an empire, they'd have been far worse. What do you think happens in any country where the US sets up a dictator? Look at how we ran South Vietnam and Argentina. Still, nobody calls the United States an empire, at least nobody of any sort of geopolitical credibility. The only states I can think of in the 21st or 20th centuries who might truly be called Empires in the truest sense of the word are Nazi Germany, Imperial Japan, and the nascent ISIS state. 

I do hope you don't mind me asking, but just for context, what country do you live in? I know that some countries: Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania - got it worse than others under the Soviets.  




 They built hospitals, infrastructure, schools, and housing. They increased standards of education and industry in most of the places they went while also fighting backwards social trends and inequality. A lot of places in the former Soviet sphere are still using Soviet infrastructure because the capitalist governments that came in afterwards are too corrupt to spend any money on fixing and replacing it.

The Soviets weren't universally evil in every single regard. There were many, many problems with the Soviet system, but to forget the good that they did is to forget a huge part of the past, and we do the past a tremendous disservice in trying to turn it into a good vs evil melodrama. 

Rather, what we should do is take the good that they did and the good that America does, learn from the mistakes of both systems, and try to use these lessons in forging ahead to a better tomorrow. 




 Speaking not just as an aspiring musician, but as a man in a wheelchair, this looks fantastic. One of my biggest problems with formal wear is that it gets all bunched up as I roll around. I could foresee this being a far lesser issue with this sort of shirt. Anyone know when something like this might be available publicly?

EDIT; Oh wait, found the link. Damn that's pricey. 




 I would compare it more to Saudi Arabia or Israel. Not every country the United States props up is a good guy, just as not ever Soviet sponsered country was horrible. That said, what they did in Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, and North Korea was truly despicable and has done a lot of damage to the lives and livelihood of the people living there, not to mention people's perception of Communism. 




 If the Kims get what happened to Mussolini, that'd be just swell. 




 I wouldn't call the Soviet Union an empire. Hegemon is more fitting. It's a somewhat similar system to the United States, where we prop up brutal dictators to suit our needs, too. Basically, all superpowers are bad. 




 Not to mention that they're starving. It's hard to rebel when you can't even get out of bed due to your body consuming itself to survive. It's a real shame. I've got something of an armchair interest in the state and I'd say North Koreans are quite possibly some of the nicest people around. They deserve better. They deserve much better. 




 Maybe the first was included with The Little Cars 6: Tokyo Drift? 




 Glorious rifle serving fascism instead of fighting it? How curious! 




 I'm pretty sure it would fall under soul. It was in commercials a few months or maybe years ago. It's been stuck in my head for ages, and although asking Reddit to identify a song based on a half remembered snippet with no lyrics relayed entirely in whistles, it's probably the best shot I've got. 









 But there's *so much space.* We'd need a sphere capable of seeing it all. In space. 




 According to UNIT special archives released to WikiLeaks, the entity known as "The Doctor" has been seen several times in connection to Cyberdyne research projects and Skynet in particular. If the conjecture that Skynet is supposed to be of great importance to the course of human history holds true and the conspiracy theories regarding time traveling battle robots holds any water, it would make sense that the Doctor would have an interest in this. 

Moreover, the Dyson family in particular have been rumored to owe the survival of their son Danny to the Doctor after the shootout that claimed the life of Miles Dyson. It's not unlikely that Danny would design the avatar of his father's life's work to resemble the man who saved his own life. 

Of course, all of this is just conjecture. 




 Shame, too. Zune was vastly superior to ipod. 




 Got any skills to bring to the table? We might need transcribers or people to run a subreddit to keep followers updated on our progress.  




 Got any foley experience? 




 Bases, not production plants. While bases are mostly located in the West as a legacy of Soviet Cold War strategic planning, what manufacturing for the military wasn't taking place in Kharkov or Russia was often sited in the Donbass. The Ukraine hasn't really invested much in relocating anything since funds for doing so were usually siphoned off by corrupt officials up to and including the present day. 




 ISIS has got scads of mint condition Abrams and T-72s/80s from Syrian and Iraqi government stores. The issue is that ISIS tanks face much greater rates of attrition than DNR and LNR tanks. The Ukraine has much less in the way of air to ground capability than the groups fighting ISIS, so the rebels in Donbass aren't having as many of their tanks destroyed. 




 It is. I think the Ukraine had some of their military-industrial capacity located there, too. Their tanks and weapons mostly come from Kharkov (nowhere near there and still in government hands), but I'm pretty sure weapons were made in the Donbass. 




 That's perfectly fine. I'm on the US East Coast and I've got team members on the West Coast of the US as well, so a bit of havoc is already quite expected. Shoot me a PM with whatever times (GMT or EST, it doesn't matter,) work best for you and your contact info and I'll start working to set up the first meeting. 




 Oh wow, that would actually be AMAZING. If you can do anything of that sort, I couldn't imagine doing this without your help. My PM is inbound. 




 I like it a lot! Consider yourself in. There are one or two things I think might be dialed back or reeled in, but you really captured the sort of arrogant, almost naive detachment that I want out of O'Hurley and the haughtily matriarchal air I wanted from the Red Queen. Would you be willing to attend a Google Hangout based collaborative session with the rest of the writing team ~once a week? 




 It's one thing to have a personal belief. It's quite another to be against somebody else having equal rights. Being against gay marriage is principally as bad as being against interracial marriage or something of that nature. People aren't upset at Adam Baldwin just for disagreeing with them.  




 You generally have to turn that on for each video. I have a monetized channel, for example, but tend to turn off monetization for videos that are in other people's IPs. 




 That might work even better. I'll chat with the other writers and see what our preference for method and time is. Once that's hashed out, we'll all get together and discuss this thing. 




 Duly noted! Thanks! 




 A little is better than none. I'll make a note of your name for when we've got a list together for a casting call. 




 That sounds awesome. We really need an audio guy for this. Shoot me a PM and we'll hammer out some details. 




 Voiceover work will be a while in coming, but if you're interested I'll be happy to keep your name in mind when we've got a script hammered out. 




 Certainly. I'll PM you and a few of the other writers in here shortly. Would you be willing to go over the specific world details in a google hangout with the other writers I'm collecting? Ideally, there will be three or four of us.

 Well, the intention has always been for the project to be noncommercial. As this is someone else's IP, I'd rather not try to capitalize on it and get 2K's lawyers upset. Rather, this is a strictly volunteer based fan project that will serve only to show our love for BioShock and maybe showcase our skills.  




 Sending now
 




 That's awful. Fascist Ukraine is the worst Ukraine. Way to turn your backs on your period of greatest glory. 




 Will do!

Yeah, that's not a biased source at all. You can totally trust them. 




 Thanks! I have a feeling I'll need it. 




 [Cue announcement music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogDy2Yk1W9A)

I'm an aspiring voice actor and have often honed my somewhat meager talents by producing audio projects. As a huge BioShock fan, a tale set in the BioShock universe seemed a natural for me and I began to embark on it with my utmost attention. 

At a certain point, I decided that this could be so much more than a half-assed amusement. Drawing upon /u/Zombietimm's post in a writing prompt [I submitted on this subreddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bioshock/comments/34y1do/writing_prompt_the_year_is_2015_the_place_is/?utm_source=feedburner utm_medium=email utm_campaign=Feed%3A+reddit%2FeCVh+%28Bioshock%29), I've devised a short list of characters and a rough timeline for what Rapture might be like in the year 2015. I have a story forming in my head, but I feel that this will need more than my talents to become a reality. And so I turn to you, /r/BioShock.

Basically, I need a writer to help me with characterization. It's always been a weakness of mine, as dialogue and character volition tend to lack in my writing. I'm more about world building and technical details. I also need someone to help me find foley and record from multiple people's computers. Finally, in the longshot event that this actually produces a script, I will eventually need voice actors. The characters I have so far, just to whet your appetites for events to come, are as follows: 

Captain Benjamin O'Hurley: an ageing career officer of the United States Navy. He's slightly too old to have been chasing Soviet subs for most of his career and never captained a mission during the Cold War. He is thus inexperienced with large scale threats, despite his many years of service. Prefers observation and 

Lieutenant Commander Miles Jenkins: The Texas' Executive Officer. A recent appointment to Captain O'Hurley's crew, this recent graduate of the Newport Officer's School was quickly promoted through to his current rank by unknown means. He directly commands the Texas' SEAL detachment and closely guards his Pentagon orders.

Orville Dodgson: A twisted, elderly man, first encountered in the ruins of Rapture. This barely coherent old man, twisted both in mind and body by severe deformities, raves endlessly about the works of Lewis Carroll. How he has survived so long in so inhospitable a place is uncertain. What is known, however, is that he will prove indispensable in deciphering the mysteries of this place. 

The Red Queen: the principal antagonist, the Red Queen seems to be the only force holding Rapture's remaining inhabitants together. She maintains the lumbering behemoths who fight a Sisyphean battle against the encroaching oceans with her mad court of semi-coherent, wizard-like scientists and supplies the twisted Splicers with the ADAM their bodies crave. Rumor has it that this so-called True Utopian had ventured to the surface and returned to save her people. 

Additionally, I will need various sailors, soldiers, splicers, and survivors; with multiple voice actors playing multiple roles.

Coordination will take place over Skype or Google Hangouts, with consensus ruling on the decision.

As this is a noncommercial fan project, I won't be able to pay anyone and can understand if people can't give 100% of their time to this, but I'd really like to see it happen and I just know that if anybody can do it, BioShock fans can. 

**Wow! This has gotten a lot of attention!** I am honored to have received so much interest from everyone. Thank you all so much! With any luck, we'll return in a month or two to show off our masterpiece. Bunny masks will be mandatory for the unveiling. 

**Update 2** I am thankful beyond words to all of the people volunteering to make this project a reality. I'm finding that I really need people with knowledge of US Navy equipment and SOP, as well as people who are familiar with *Something in the Sea* to consult on various world and character details. If this is you, please consult with us!  




 illogical

You green blooded hobgoblins and your logic. Let go of logic. There is only the Force. 




 I always take Legends to mean it's canon until proven otherwise. It's fiction. There's no wrong way to approach it as long as you enjoy it.
