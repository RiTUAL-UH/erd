 In the least surprising news of the day, I've found that the biased SJW-type presenter also works for the BBC. 














 Unsurprisingly, the rather biased feminist interviewer also has a job at the BBC. 









 If he'd have just shouted racist at her it would have been much more entertaining (and appropriate). 




 Even from a British perspective it's usage in this instance is completely inappropriate and quite offensive given the circumstances (surely the correct term is "civil rights campaigner" or "gender equality activist". That said, the rest of the article isn't too bad. 









 A somewhat disappointing headline, but the comments section is simply magical.

From what I've read of this case it seems extremely complicated and it seems this guy has been failed by the state throughout his entire life. 












































 Lets not link to total fabrications please. it doesn't even allow comments so how is there any value at all in such a link? 







































 There are no less than three "Boys are Stupid, throw rocks at them" products on the B N website. Most responsible companies withdrew these products either in 2004 or in the follow-up campaign last year. 




 Here's the best summary of the case for those who want to know the detail. There's a lot of myths out there so it's well worth a read of the truth: http://espn.go.com/espn/otl/story/_/id/12976615/detailed-look-hope-solo-domestic-violence-case-includes-reports-being-belligerent-jail

  Double standards.

No. Siddique's religion is an integral part of his work/fame. He's a leading Muslim, not simply a regular/occasional Muslim. 




 Apologies, I just basically took the title from the video to avoid suggestions of editorialising. 









 Funny how in all of these scandals the opinions are left-wing or anti Conservative/UKIP.  




  You know how often they mentioned him being a Christian?
 Fucking never.

That's probably becasue he was Jewish: http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/1.638528




**edit**, awww he's deleted the post. Real shame, a true classic. 




  To be fair, this statement could be used for any actual terrorist group to justify their actions. Isis "only adopted their tactics" because...

Not really, it say they only use the tactics becasue of the failure to uphold the law. The likes of ISIS hate the most fundamental features of our system of law and even democracy itself. 









 From a few years back but I was reminded of the story today as there's controversy over them doing similar things to other groups of late.

Also this hasn't been posted before nor does there seem to have been an apology for what happened. 
























 This reminds me of their 2011 presentation which lymped in Fathers4Justice with the 9/11 attacks, the IRA and Animal Liberation Front.

https://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/second-thoughts-on-extreme-tactic/418439.article?sectioncode=26 storycode=418439 c=1

The Fathers4jjustice smear was not only more severe, but also less accurate given they just wear silly costumes. The worst they do is occasionally throw various pancake ingredients at Labour politicians. 









 2000 people clearly disagree with you. 




 Best parts starts at 9 minutes in: https://youtu.be/8eHLnb6kYnc?t=9m9s 




 By far the best part starts at 9 minutes in: https://youtu.be/8eHLnb6kYnc?t=9m9s 




 Also served as a Minister according to the Sun, so that excludes about 70% of those on your list. 














 that's 545 under 24 year olds vs 104 women of any age (and it's less than 104 these days.) The actual number of male suicides is over 4,500. 














 Nice to see the Universities disgraceful behaviour starting to have consequences. 




 A reminder of Burchill's previous thoughts on male suicide: http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/oct/16/weekend7.weekend6

"Well, if the men who manage football think that 545 under-24 male suicides a year is a more frightening statistic than two women killed each week - and hundreds of thousands injured every year - by the men they live with, then they must be even stupider than they look; though it's hard to imagine, I know. But I can't help feeling they're on very dodgy ground, taking on the young male suicide thing. For a start, it's a phony panic, catering to that lowest of modern male desires - to be a victim"

"That young men succeed in suicide more often than girls isn't really the point. Indeed, the more callous among us would say that it was quite nice for young men finally to find something that they're better at than girls." 



















 Meanwhile far worse happens to millions of babies and it's 100% deliberate every single time. If they're rally unlucky they'll live in NYC and some sicko with herpes will suck the blood from the wound afterwards (and the government will be ok with it too!) 
























 The fact that it's legal to carry out similar mutilations on boys show the law to be inconsistent and therefore flawed.

Of course the way to fix this is to protect boys from mutilation too,  but anyone supporting mutilation can take the opposite position an argue they're being discriminated against and they should be able to cut girls just as other cut boys. 




 That study is at odds with most other research (and it even says as much in the link). 




  There aren't any 'benefits' to FGM. There are to circumcision. 

Actually, pretty much every supposed "benefit" of MGM also applies to FGM.
 




  There's no apparent evolutionary sense to wanking

Not true at all. It cuts the risk of prostate cancer and also helps maintain sexual function. 









 The topic of the story is the mutilation of children's genitals without their consent. If we made it illegal to mutilate all kids , regardless of gender, you'd instantly take away one of the best arguments supporting FGM.

People opposing MGM are the biggest opponents of FGM - they go further than feminist opponents of the practice and want to protect all victims of mutilation instead of just a small percentage. 




  We need more mental health initiatives.

That's true and mental health may have been one factor here, but I object to this statement on its own - it's now standard response to these cases and pretending that mental health care is the main issue is used to gloss over the abuse men face in our society.

This guy was denied access to his kids, and in most cases these denials of contact are quite clearly wrong. He killed himself in prison, where he had already been subject to violence and it's highly doubtful that he should have even been there in the first place.

If we allow men to be mistreated again and again, and then imprison them for highlighting such abuses (where the abuse continues) then inevitably some will reach breaking point, regardless of whatever mental health care is available.

We need to fix the root causes of these problems, sometimes that's mental health, but mostly it's the shocking way men are abused and mistreated by society. 














 Sorry to hear about your loss, this is a reminder of why we're all here. 




 His imprisonment was as result of his protests, not for any actual crimes: http://newfathers4justice.co.uk/2015/06/06/suffragent-free-haydn-burton/

Of particular note, is that his arrest was at the hands of Hampshire Police, who have also engaged in some extremely distributing practices against the founder of the original Fahters4Justice, a case which also involved alleged misconduct by a Conservative MP. Matt O'Connor of F4J is currently been dragged through the courts by the police and has also been subject to physical attack by Conservatives at his own home!

So in summary, in one county we have a corrupt police force going out of their way to target all fathers rights campaigners who dare to engage with Conservative politicians, and there are very close ties between Conservative politicians in this country and the police force.

Essentially it seems that the the country in question is not a safe place for anyone concerned with equality for fathers. 














 Could we do something nice for this guy, maybe raise some money for him? 
























   They have to be as unbiased as possible when reporting the news and they enforce this heavily. With any news they have to be as unbiased as possible.

They're supposed to be unbiased, but they're terrible when it comes to gender issues. It's now basically a feminist organisation. 




 U.S. soccer thinks she does as do over 10k people who favourited their tweet

 No idea, sorry. 




 There isn't one. 




 The guy who made this video made countless other equally good one on other gender related issues, with hours and hours of original content interviewing figures such as Erin Pizzey. His original channels have disappeared, but some of the best vids are mirrored on other channels. Search for "manwomanmyth" for more similar content. 

The follow channel has mirrored quite a few of the videos:

Here's a good one to get you started: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjwe6ECiXi4 
























 Exactly, and this case is elevated well above those in significance becasue Solo is representing her country rather than just dong her day job by playing for a random team/business 




  It was looked into and there was no hard proof Solo was the instigator just a bunch of he said she said

The case was dismissed on procedural grounds, therefore the allegations haven't actually been "looked into" yet in court. There's also rather more proof in this case than a great many other cases that end up in court. 




  Does that mean the celebration of the US victory is something to be questioned? I don't think so.

If she'd maybe have stayed away from the celebrations then it wouldn't be so bad. Perhaps if the other athletes had come out against domestic violence then it would be a little more tolerable. But if even 10% of the allegations about Solo are true then she shouldn't have been on the team and therefore any victory is going to be tainted by that. 




  There was bunch of he said she said going on and dismissed like a normal case.

No, it was dismissed on procedural grounds. This dismissal gets appealed on Monday so there's still a very real chance of her facing justice 




  Because one person on the team is a dickhead, you can't celebrate winning a world cup? 

No, you suspend said person from the team before the tournament and have a squad completely free of violent assholes who are all fit to represent their country.
 




  The outcome of the Women's World Cup has nothing to do with the handling of Hope Solo's case.

Of course it does, Sole played every minute for the winning team! 




 I only just found this article and this is my only account here.

It's a highly topical story - prosecutors are expected to appeal the dismissal of the case on Monday. 










































































 I'd normally condemn you for linking to such a hateful site, but it does at least seem to be allowing comments, so that makes it excusable in my book. 




  people who couldn't beat 13-14 year old boys

One of the team members is allegedly very good at beating boys... 









 The charges were only dropped on proceedural grounds, this is being appealed in a few days time. 




 Does the 6% figure include all the additional still births and miscarriages etc? The article also only spoke about defects diagnosed in infancy, health issues can emerge later in childhood or even as young adults and perhaps they're being glossed over too?

 



















  'Debunking feminist myths'? Ugh.

Did you actually watch the video?, I know it's long but at least view the first 5 minutes. Whatever you opinion of his other politics it's clear he's an MP who taken the time to research an issue in depth, ask questions, study the data and find the truth. I doubt you'll see a better performance from any politician from any party, and its' a real shame there weren't more there to hear what he said and learn from his work. 




 Davies has done some fantastic work highlighting sexism in the prison and justice system and debunking feminist myths. This speech is well worth watching:

http://human-stupidity.com/stupid-dogma/mens-rights-feminism/conservative-backbencher-philip-davies-thoroughly-debunks-feminist-politicians-politically-correct-nonsense 









 And only two women in the top 100 (with one of those set to lose her top 100 place in August) 




 He's saying most of the crap ones who lose drop out. If you're good at what you do then you obviously wouldn't drop out for the reason he suggests and therefore his point doesn't apply to you. 









 Philip Davies has been working to highlight inequalities in the prison system for years now, he's gone from basically knowing nothing about the issue and believing all the feminist lies to being the most knowledgeable person in Parliament on the topic. It's really worth watching some of his speeches on this issue, please consider following him on twitter and tweeting in support of his work. 









 Probably the most comprehensive article on this topic, useful for dispelling some myths about the case that seem to be flying around.

  Looks at your post history

While we're on the topic of post histories, care to explain yours? 









  I hadn't heard of the idea of men being on the ends of the spectrum and women in the middle. It's a compelling idea but probably not 100% accurate. 

it's absolutely accurate and absolutely the perfect argument to explain the lack of female geniuses and chess grand masters, becasue the differences are by far  the most significant at the genius level extreme of the spectrum.

There's also evidence to suggest that the male curve is shifted very marginally to the right of the female one. This difference is extremely small, but it magnifies the differences at the extreme right of the curve. 




 I'm not necessarily defending his body language during all the discussion. However, if an opponent makes a point that ridiculous/extreme then laughter can be an appropriate response at that immediate moment. If she'd have been able to debate properly and left out the most idiotic "arguments" then there wouldn't have been anything to laugh at. 




 That victim blaming point really was worthy of a laugh though, by then I was laughing too. Nothing wrong in laughing when something is that ridiculous. 




 At club level yes, but this world cup has received plenty of hype. 




  she defending her sister from her nephew

Solo went to the nephew/sister's house drunk (in her car). She insulted him about his weight, was asked to leave but then followed them into the house. She then attacked the nephew and he restrained her. After he was persuaded to release her she attacked thim again repeatedly punching him in the face smashing his head into the concrete. Solo's half sister then tried to protect her son, at which point she was then also repeatedly punched in the face by Solo. The nephew grabbed the BB gun t try to get Solo out of the house, and Solo later lied to the police that it had been a real gun.

Both the victims had visible injuries and Solo swore at the police and even threatened them when arrested. 




 Where were the people who claim to care about domestic violence though? How many domestic violence charities condemned her? How many feminists and other activists did so and started contacting sponsors etc?

I've seen one politician condemn what she did and one player (and she was retiring anyway). 




 ..said the mod of /againstmensrights! 














  the charges were dismissed.

They were dismissed **on procedural grounds**, not becasue of any evidence pointing to her lack of guilt. This dismissal of the charges is now being appealed by prosecutors, so there's a good chance she'll end up on trial. 


































 The BBC does exactly the same thing in the UK, their Comic Relief campaign donates to the "Paws for Kids" charity helping the pets of women and children who are victims of domestic violence. Meanwhile men barely get a penny from anyone.

This issue was identified as early as 2007: http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/24th-march-2007/16/read-the-small-print-before-the-next-comic-relief 




 Actually it's the rarity of them getting caught and the prosecuted which makes it news. 




 They're clearly discriminating by gender, that's my point. 


































 The Greens really are now the most sexist political party in the UK.

They only want men to go to prison, men appear to be completely sidelined in the party (despite them claiming to have equality when it comes to the leadership and deputy leader position). Can you name a current Green Party figure who isn't female? When did you last see a male from the party sent to be their representative on TV or speaking at one of their press conferences?

Looking at Bennett's background we see she worked for the extremist feminist organisation the Fawcett Society and therefore it's no surprise she comes out with sexist rubbish such as this. No wonder so few males vote for the party. 




 "Mansplaining" is a sexist term invented by feminists so they can avoid debate with men and instead play the victim any time they get something completely wrong.

More recently they've introduced other similar sexist terms such as "manspreading" for when a person supposedly takes up too much space on public transport.

it's quite incredible to see feminists such as Bennett supporting such sexism as feminists pretend to be in favour of gender neutral terminology at all times, yet here they are inventing more and more unnecessarily gendered language (and quite unpleasant and sexist language at that). 

















































 Yes. 














 The admin who runs AMA losts her job shortly after this, so there may well be a major men's rights angle to the current Reddit meltdown. 









 They'd promote gender equality for everyone rather than just special privileges for women (which is was feminism has become). 



















 Yes but those facing such charges would expect to be suspended. If she's actually guilty of attacking a child then she gets banned from the team for good, not simply suspended. 














 Any policies to reduce the gender education gap (something that's actually a genuine issue) 



















  There is no blatant sexist double standard. Male athletes beat the shit outta females all the time, and get slapped on the wrist

In some of the cases where males have been suspended it was actually the female who attacked first. We see the same double standard in the music industry - Chris Brown gets vilified for abusing his partner, yet Amy Winehouse, Whitney Houston, Cheryl Cole all get a pass and in most cases boast about their abuse and sometimes even make money out of it. 




 Who's to say I'm fully in favour of suspension? I'm sharing an interesting video, there's an argument for innocent until proven guilty, though a precedent has been set with many other male athletes, so in the US at least she need suspending. There would be an alternative or reinstating others accused of domestic violence. My main concern is the blatantly sexist double standard rather than taking a stance on which of the two options would be correct. 




 Yes an argument in early June which exposed the true facts of the case and thus made an extremely compelling case for her suspension, nothing has changed since then has it? Obviously it's a little late now, but the fact is that every game Solo plays just compounds matters and arguably brings shame on the team, making it difficult for fans to get behind them. 




 Good argument there, really convincing. 









 It's ongoing news. Every match she plays and ever game the USA win makes the story bigger and bigger and makes the problem worse. 




 The fact that the USA have progressed to the final means we'll see this abuser representing her country on the biggest possible stage in her sport. The plus side to that is there should be even more attention in her case when it comes to court.
