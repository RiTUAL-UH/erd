 I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; is it really hump day in Cleveland again?. I am going to do it SOBER! 




 I am not drinking TODAY in solidarity with you.  Today is what counts.   




 [This is the link to the post in the FAQ on What do Drinking Dreams Mean?](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2dit1m/what_do_drinking_dreams_mean/)  I wrote it after I exchanged emails with two of the country's leading dream researchers.   




 Welcome to your new millennium! 




 So usually, I save this link for the day that someone begins the journey, but I'm going to share [the link to the Baby Steps with you, tonight](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2ree7a/hey_cc_im_newly_sober_what_do_i_do_next_the_baby/) because you asked for advice.  The Baby Steps post is the advice that I got when I started my sober journey and I've shared it thousands of times with newcomers to r/stopdrinking, and now with you too.

Good luck. 




 We all do this; when certain sober promises kick-in you will feel yourself pause and go: Oh, yeah, it's only Tuesday, that's not on my plate for today.

 Congratulations on your anniversary; an invite to join us on /r/dinos will follow in your inbox. 









 That's what I did--lot's of them and sober activities.  But another thing that was helpful to me is the [Daily Check-in on r/stopdrinking.](http://is.gd/afsucks) 









 Early sobriety can be an emotional roller coaster.  In early sobriety I was dealing with lots of heavy weather including coming to grips with being criminally prosecuted over unfiled and unpaid taxes and losing my professional license and career.  I was psychologically miserable, but I got counseling, dove back into AA and I got through it all, one day at a time.  Today, my sobriety is my most valuable asset. 




 Good work, /u/jdee1 -- we carry the message we don't carry the alcoholic.
 




 Nice!  




 I went to AA meetings and I didn't drink.  Trust me, I had a very tough first year after returning from relapse.  But it was worth it and it got better. 




 In the early days of sobriety all I had to stay focused on was not drinking and going to bed sober.  That in and of itself suffices for a real victory.  Baby yourself through these rocky first two weeks, and I promise it will all be worth it.  Already, you know if you don't pick up the next drink you NEVER have to go through the first four days again. 
























 I doubt it.  He hugged O. 




 It's breathtaking.  They get this enormous fee and it's not enough.  They create this phony cy pres foundation to steal millions more.  Judges, lawyers are disbarred and sent to jail including the legendary Stanley Chesley, husband of US District Judge Sustan Dlott.

 1. Enjoy Tuesday;

2. Enjoy Wednesday;

3. Enjoy Thursday;

4. When Friday comes, you are only in charge of doing the best that you can and going to bed sober--you win.

 Welcome to Club 2000, FM12! 




 I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad;. I'm keeping Tuesday SOBER in Cleveland.   




 Welcome /u/TheEyeDontLie -- you sound like a [Country Song.](https://youtu.be/-Qu8RPvhP-U)  Bear in mind, that we can wallow in the sadness and tragedy of the past until we don't anymore because we choose not to; or, we finally drink ourselves to death.  Prior history does not dictate our fate--if we choose otherwise.  So how do we choose to be SOBER?  [I changed the historical record by doing the things I describe at the Baby Steps link.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Good luck to you. 




 [Nature Boy](https://youtu.be/Iq0XJCJ1Srw) 




 CC says, this is a really great post and a fine illustration of what AA's call "emotional sobriety."   




 For a relapser, your username shows up in my browser with beau coup upvotes which means you know how to do this whole deal and at some point had some good insights.  Like me, I guess when I came back from relapse in 2009--I had to go back to the very beginning and not miss any of the basics.  




 Congratulations, /u/Giasone_3 on your 1-Year anniversary!  I see where Slip has already invited you to join us on r/dinos--you are a role model, my friend. 




 Remarkable for the Court's analysis of the "snitch's" cooperation. 














 Fear and total insecurity.  









 In a nutshell that is the whole damned truth.  He is America's version of Jimmy Saville.  Worse, he pretended to be a positive moral role model.   



















 That's a real ACTION step.   




 Good for you.  45 days or so I'll add you to r/dinos.   
























 Welcome /u/newagain62015--I like to share the [Baby Steps with as many an SD newcomer as I see](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) hoping that the things that helped me stop drinking and get sober helps others.  Good luck to you. 




 I face the things I'm afraid of by remembering one important fact: all I have to do TODAY--for today to be successful--is to go to bed SOBER.  I do this by practicing the things I describe at this [link which goes to a post called the Baby Steps.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  I hope something there will give you some ideas for your next steps on your journey.  Good luck and welcome. 
























 Understandable.  Don't fool around with a serious medical situation. 




 All of this makes sense, but you need to ask the questions of a licensed medical professional not well-intentioned and supportive strangers on the internet.  Please go see a doctor. 




 Don't forget Kasich, who called a Highway Patrol trooper a jerk in public remarks for pulling him over for speeding.  









 Good for you.  I know a lot of people in the service industry who stay sober.  Guess how I know them?  AA meetings. 














 That's a big step forward. Now build on the gain and you might be on your way. 




 As a side note: I'm reading Tim Weiner's (famous for the CIA history, Legacy of Ashes) new book on Nixon.  Admiral John McCain turns out to be one of the real villains of the Viet Nam War. 









 No enemy get's free rent in my head. 














 McCain BECAME a war hero in my eyes when he refused early release in favor of fellow captives. 





























 Sitting IN my emotions has proved to be pretty much a waste of time.  What I needed to do was move my feet.  While AA meetings might not be the answer for everyone, for me AA proved to be a place where action and progress was supported and reinforced.   














 I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; another beautiful Monday in Cleveland. 




 Super smart insight. 




  took out the recycling and felt no shame because the empty bottles/cans weren't mine.

I remember being new in AA years ago and listening to fellow AAs talk about their "Supply Problem" with getting and hiding bottles.  I thought, sheesh, I have a disposal problem.  I'm glad to see I wasn't the only one ; ) 




 Notice that in recovery we make a distinction between Joy and Happiness.  We are promised Freedom, Joy and Happiness as a byproduct of working a recovery program, for a reason.   









 Great, great...keep updating us. 




 Next /u/1literCC I will be adding my friend to the /r/dinos sub.   Great work! 




 I  don't drink no matter what happens good or bad.   




 I like it.  For me it's easiest when I make my daily commitment the moment I wake up. 




 This is a longtime African-American neighborhood, close to University Circle but really not part of that neighborhood. 




 Good work.  It gets better. 




 Good work, my friend, keep doing what you are doing. 









 One of the things that you will see me say on /r/stopdrinking (in fact I say it so often that it is occasionally used as a tagline in the daily check-in) my decision not to drink TODAY, only--is not dependent upon what others do or don't do.  I make the decision not to drink TODAY, and I doggedly persist in that commitment to myself.  I am not at fault for "getting" my "disease" of alcoholism, but I am responsible for the treatment. 




 Some profound ideas, there, /u/Choices63 -- thank you for sharing the wisdom. 



















 Yes, this is an epiphany!  I VALUE sobriety. 




 Welcome /u/tannis21 to /r/stopdrinking; my [standard advice is at this link to a post known as the Baby Steps,](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) its actually the advice someone else gave me when I started and things I've picked up along the way.  Let me be clear--nothing in my relationships, no drama, nothing was more important than staying SOBER today.  In time, all things worked out. 




 Welcome /u/bugger_off to r/stopdrinking.  Since you've been lurking you've probably come across [this link to the Baby Steps post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) but it's not such a bad place to start stopping.  Good luck to you. 




 Welcome back, /u/yowzees.   




 This is ACTION and remember the [Baby Steps](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) holds that we act our way into better thinking, we don't think our way into better acting. 




 The great insight that I had about cravings is that it is an emotion just like anger, joy, jealousy, sadness.  In our case a craving is a powerful desire for alcohol and like all emotions it is fleeting.  Generally speaking time heals everything--including cravings.  One other thing, I was able to move along the healing considerably when I recognized that I am ex-drinker and therefore I no longer process that emotion. 




 That's just great!

I know for me, I got to 400 days from 200 days by focusing each day on the 24 ahead. 




 The problem with booze as a medication for what ailed me, I could never get the dosage right. 




 Congratulations, /u/the0riginalp0ster -- so why no outside support?   




 That very idea struck me this morning as I was reading about this. 









 Yeah, I'm grieving just for this reason, LOL. 



















 No one on /r/stopdrinking is interested in converting drinkers into non-drinkers.  Nor am I concerned with convincing anyone that they should QUIT drinking which to my way of thinking implies permanency.  What I am suggesting is a path to stopping drinking, TODAY and today, only.  Sometimes sustained time sober changes our entire outlook on our relationship with alcohol.  That's how it worked for me. 




 Hey, /u/sugarfreehowl -- YOU ARE NOT A MISTAKE.  How do you know this?  We just told you so.  

When a person judges another person.  There is the pointing finger, and then there are the three fingers curled back pointing at the person pointing.  In other words, we judge those who we see as most like ourselves.  There is a saying in AA that is right-on:

You spot, you got it.

Oh, one other thing, I strive mightily in recovery to never give free rent in my head to those I resent, and I try to not resent. 




 OK, /u/benqb1 -- I'm not drinking in solidarity with you, also check out the [Baby Steps post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) for some other effective "next steps" and see if any of that resonates for you.  Best of luck to you. 




 Welcome /u/Discarnated--why not check-in again totally SOBER?  In the interim [try the Baby Steps](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which is what I did to stop drinking and get sober.  A lot of us on /r/stopdrinking started there.  Good luck. 




 I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; I'm keeping Sunday SOBER all day on the north coast. 




 No, expressly not.  The Big Book speaks highly of the value of physicians and mental health professionals and encourages us to avail ourselves of those resources. 




 He saves that whole gutter-wallow for his attacks on the President of the United States. 









 Change often comes when you go all-in.   




 I have gone cold turkey in my life from daily drinking to zero--twice.  Both times, I was depressed, I suffered severe withdrawal including audio hallucinations, and panic attacks.  I slept fitfully for a few days and then I was fine.  Each of us is different, physically, mentally and I would highly suggest talking honestly to a licensed medical provider. 




 Good.  My sobriety is my most valuable possession.  It is not something that I will give up for any reason.  It is the key to any hope I have to live a free, happy and joyous life. 




 I hope you submit this to the Saturday Share link.   




 That's great news!  Keep doing what you're doing and before you know it I will be adding you to r/DINOs. 




 [Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) are the way I found the "next steps" to getting sober and staying sober. 




 Pretty cool, this. 




 1. I am grateful for hot summery weather in Cleveland;

2. I am grateful that my spousal unit did the grocery shopping without me and all I had to do was unload the car; and,

3. I am totally grateful for my friends on /r/stopdrinking and in AA. 




 Well-done, my friend, Mouse. 




 Congratulations, /u/aanon_18901--glad you found us.  I just added you to r/dinos, so check your inbox. 




 When the student is ready, the teacher appears.  It sounds to me like you are ready.  Congratulations.

 Alcohol is a chemical depressant.  What worked for me even when I came back from 7 years in the Hell of Relapse was the [Baby Steps.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) 




 Beautiful and touching post.  I was the king of false pride and pretend courage.  I guess what I'm saying was that the precursor to honesty for me wasn't so much courage as a whole lot of exhaustion and a tiny bit of willingness to admit that everything I felt, everything I thought might, possibly, could be...wrong.  With that openness to the possibility that I was living a lie--everything changed.

Great track.  Here's one [Live Forever](https://youtu.be/aeJ4kp1AwY4) 




 I'm impressed!   




 I strongly suspect that my alcoholism was related to, caused, or significantmy aggravated my psychological disorders.  When I stopped drinking and got SOBER in addition to AA meetings I went to see my shrink.  That was great too.  AA encourages this explicitly in the Big Book.  But the most important thing for me is that self knowledge alone did not get me or keep me SOBER.  My participation in a recovery fellowship made all the difference. 



















 In the FAQ (on the sidebar) there is this [link which attempts to set some of this out.](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/36cgmh/faq_timelines/)  Can I add as someone who has some time in sobriety including a prior 15 year continuous stretch of sobriety, that I would take all of this as very generic and only slightly relevant to your potential experience.  While we can all generally talk about withdrawal, breakthroughs, insights, recovery--because of who we are individually and genetically each of us may have different experiences.  Factor in the quality of individual effort at recovery and you have a whole other factor to consider.   Good luck to you--as a general rule: what effort you put in, is what you get out.  Remember the [Baby Steps](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) say we act our way into better thinking.

 It's a super common experience based on my own experience and reading the posts on /r/stopdrinking for several years now.  Here's my [post on the meaning of drinking dreams after I exchanged emails with leading dream researchers.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2dit1m/what_do_drinking_dreams_mean/) 





























 Welcome /u/happytobesober to /r/stopdrinking.  Since you're new I'll share the [link to the Baby Steps post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which is what I did to stop drinking and stay stopped.  It also serves as sort of "what do I do next" post.  Good luck and I look forward to seeing your posts and comments. 




 Newf's rule (and drool.) 




 I think the distinction may have more to do with the traditional approaches to recovery--the 12 Step, AA model of recovery was based on a "singleness of purpose" which is to recover from alcoholism, BECAUSE prior recovery models: the WCTU, the Oxford Group, the Washingtonians all failed with multiple goals, issues, and ambitions.  AA officially declared we will deal with alcoholism and alcoholics ONLY.  This has changed considerably over the years but in my nearly 30 years in AA I've seen actual hostility to drug addicts and arguments about the appropriateness of mentioning drugs of any sort in an AA meetings.  Although no less a dualy-addicted recovering alcoholic by the name of Dr. Bob Smith (AA's co-fonder) discusses both issues in his famous "personal story" that begins the second section of AA's Big Book.  

By the way, not to argue with JBH,  alcohol was wholly illegal (Prohibition) when the modern recovery movement was founded in 1935.  So, embedded in our thinking (and the marketing of recovery by treatment centers) is the idea that addictions ARE different from alcoholism.  Whether this duality has a scientific basis or not, I have no opinion.  Still he distinction probably has more to do with the historical duality that is a legacy of the success and failure of recovery movements.

One other point: AA has dramatically de-emphasized the "singleness of purpose" observation and even traditional AA strongholds around Cleveland and Akron where I am active easily  embrace participation by both alcoholics and addicts. 




 Congratulations, /u/n8saces.   









 Exactly! 




 In the past I describe going through what you are describing, here.  Fortunately I had more time sober so when I looked up and saw my Dewar's Scotch billboard that previously called my name, I just laughed and said--almost out loud--that has NOTHING to do with me, I'm an ex-drinker. 




 Hey double-D here's [a pic of my Saharid Club where I resumed my AA participation in 2009.](http://imgur.com/2uYPzpX)  As you can see it's not as lovely are your venue.  A wood clad, concrete block building over a service garage owned by Indian-Americans.   
























 I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; TGIF all over SD world, especially Cleveland. 




 This is what I would be concerned with.   




 Huge step, congrats! 




 /r/dinos is the super secret private sub for SDers with a year or more sobriety.   




 I envy you your week off.  

Here's how I do vacations: I wake up and decide that I am not going to drink TODAY, only.  I usually hit a day time AA meeting and then I go for a long bike ride.  Sometimes I'll hit an early evening meeting too.  If there are any AA activities, dances, golf outings, etc. I might do those events too.  I hang out in coffee houses and I go to movies.  Have fun.  Then the next day, I do it all over again.   




 Have you read through the [Baby Steps post?](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Many of us, including me--were able to get traction with the simple actions described there. 




 Welcome /u/dr_eleanorabernathy to r/stopdrinking.  Thank you for the introduction.  Let me share with you the [link to the Baby Steps post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which describes how I stopped drinking and how I got sober.  I'm told the ideas there are helpful and "next" steps to doing this whole sober journey.

One other thing, "rock bottom" in my experience is not a place, it's a metaphor.  When we have had enough, when alcohol is no longer fun, that's rock bottom.  Oh, sure we could keep digging, or in my case drilling--but it doesn't change the fact that I hit rock bottom.

Good luck and I hope you keep posting and updating as you go along. 




 Yikes!  I am so sorry.  Take it easy and keep updating us so we can send out the positive vibes. 




 So what else are you doing /u/razmataz_90 besides not drinking and some diet improvements to recover from the alcohol abuse that put you in the hospital with pancreatitis?  AA meetings, IOP, counseling  I would think that people are asking these questions because THEY CARE ABOUT YOU.  

When I was in early recovery my family and friends asked because they love me and were pulling for me to fully recover.  I had to stop being a resentful, selfish prick and learn to accept the support that came my way.  Even if it's just a question about my course and treatment, it is caring--and the least that I can do is be grateful and by sober actions show that change is REAL.   




 Thank you so much for this great post.  You are living the whole new way of life.
