 I get that.  Your reply is irrelevant to my comment, which was asking for a source on the specific claim made. 














 You could try sleeping all day for awhile.  Perhaps you need the rest. 




 I didn't realize they could get the half-life of caffeine in my blood from a saliva sample.  That's incredible^TM!

**The Power of SCIENCE** 




 I believe so.

A revealing passage from about midway into the exchange, Harris writing:

On the topic of there being a moral equivalence between al-Shifa and 9/11, Im afraid that what you have written is hard to understand. Despite your insistence that you drew no moral equivalence whatsoever between the two cases, you call Clintons actions an atrocity the consequences of which were vastly more severe than if the same had been done to the U.S., and you say that any comparison with the consequences of 9/11 is, if anything, an understatement. 

This topic had gone back and forth a few times by this point, and Chomsky's meaning was quite clear before the conversation even began.  From Chomsky's book 9/11, quoted very early in the conversation:

I mentioned that the **toll** of the horrendous crime of 9-11, committed with wickedness and awesome cruelty (quoting Robert Fisk), may be comparable to the **consequences** of Clintons bombing of the Al-Shifa plant in August 1998.

(emphasis mine)

Throughout the conversation, Harris fails to distinguish between descriptions of the consequences of an action and claims about the ethical status of that action.  This is the kind of thing a philosophy student typically learns to do *before* they've even taken a course in ethics, in their Intro to Philosophy course or its equivalent.

He either has not acquired the basic thinking tools necessary to succeed in philosophical discourse, or he is trolling incredibly hard.  Either way, I see little reason to devote much thought to what he has to say about any topic that requires philosophical rigor.
 




 Sam Harris disproved Eastern philosophy and Wittgenstein *years* before he disproved analytic philosophy. 




 One reasonably strong objection that I haven't seen raised in this thread is to consider the well-being of others.

Taking the Odysseus example:

Suppose that staying on the island in a drug-induced stupor *is* in fact the best way for Odysseus and his companions to maximize their utility (i.e. hedonism would work for them in a utilitarian ethic), and suppose that utilitarianism is correct.

Surely if they left their wives, children, and communities back home to grow old and die without them, that would result in great suffering for their loved ones.  Imagine if news reached home to their families that they had chosen to hang out on an island getting stoned forever instead of coming home - or perhaps as bad, imagine if they never heard a word of news at all?

Assuming these fellows have any personal ties, it seems that if by going home they can secure at least a moderately good life for everyone involved, this would maximize utility across the whole group.

Does this have any relevance for real-world ethics?  Perhaps not, if there is reason to believe that most people can be successful hedonists; but it seems to me that many of the arguments *for* hedonism presented in this thread are weakened when the focus is broadened beyond isolated individuals.

Think about it: is a hedonistic *society* really going to maximize utility? 




 jajajaja 




 Can you link to your source?  If such a wide range in rate were common, it would be quite a surprise. 














 You're assuming many things about how vegetarianism effects meat consumption, and why vegetarianism matters ethically, and so on.

First, though, the easy argument: vegetarianism already has a definition, and it clearly isn't your working definition.  Vegetarianism is defined as *not eating meat*.  That is an almost universally accepted meaning, and words get their meaning through consensus.  So you need a new word - what you're describing isn't vegetarianism.

That's boring though, because what you really want is to consider the ethics of your position.

So - you figure there is no ethical difference so long as you aren't supporting meat production (presumably the parts that hurt animals).

One reason this view is incorrect has to do with how vegetarianism spreads.  People generally become vegetarian because they discover a culture of vegetarianism and find it appealing.  Perhaps it's the culture they're born into (e.g. in parts of India); such people are raised vegetarian and historically have tended to remain so for life.  Others meet somebody who is vegetarian, are curious, and are inspired by this person's commitment to ethics and their empathy for the suffering of others.

Well, consider this situation where you're eating part of your friend's sandwich.  How inspiring is that?  Is your friend going to think, "Gee, maybe I should be a vegetarian, too - this vegetarian friend of mine really seems convinced that it's wrong to eat animals."  No, she won't think that.  She's more likely to think "Huh...vegetarias want to eat meat too.  Maybe they're not on to anything so great after all."

Ask any vegetarian who is a convert how they came to their decision, and see what they say.  Just about every one I've met had some contact with other vegetarians, and was gradually convinced of their point of view, and then felt disturbed by their own involvement in animal cruelty - which eventually led to them losing their taste for meat.  How will vegetarianism spread if all the vegetarians lack the ethical conviction not to hunger for a bite off someone's sandwich?

If you believe it's wrong to support animal cruelty by buying meat, then surely you believe you have a duty to not encourage others to buy meat.  Unless you believe that wishy-washy "vegetarians" who want bites of meat off others' sandwiches are going to be just as effective at spreading vegetarianism as truly convinced vegetarians who have lost their taste for meat out of disgust for its terrible origins, then you really can't ethically allow yourself to be a wishy-washy sandwich nibbler. 




 It really doesn't matter how big the sandwich is - if you don't eat that bite, somebody else will.  That somebody else will then be more satiated with meat than they would have been if you'd taken the bite instead.  So by taking a bite, you're adding one bite of meat to the world - it isn't a free bite.

Your argument might be able to justify eating *discarded* meat that nobody else would ever eat if you didn't.  But that's really the limit.

This may be somewhat similar to historical rules for begging monks in some Buddhist traditions, who could eat meat given to them out of charity, but only if the conditions satisfied a complex set of rules that ensured that the meat was otherwise waste. 




 Well...

You have high blood pressure.  Your post talks about a lot of things that probably have very little to do with your high blood pressure, but glosses over or ignores risk factors that are extremely well supported by scientific evidence.  It's unlikely that you're going to drop your blood pressure substantially with supplements, especially considering that you're already using several.

This is why I gave my advice below: to stop taking all the supplements and see what happens, and then reintroduce them to confirm the effect (if any). And more importantly, to address those risk factors that you can which are actually strongly supported by evidence - reduce stress, follow recommended exercise levels, reduce bodyweight if appropriate, reduce stimulant use if you use, etc.

My purpose in this comment thread, however, was simply to inquire about a mistaken research method - making causal attributions on the basis of self-testing without a blind.  You have no idea how much, if any, of that 10/5mmHg drop was from garlic, and you don't need to - it's a distraction from what you really ought to be focusing on if you want to address your high blood pressure.  You didn't get to 140/90 by not eating enough garlic or grapeseed extract. ;-) 




 Heh.

What distinguishes us from cave men is that we exist, while cave men are only a convenient fantasy invoked by people whose knowledge of human prehistory leaves much to be desired. 




 Look - it isn't pedantic to clarify when somebody has thoroughly misunderstood what you've said, and is putting words in your mouth. 




 *Ohhhhhh* that sick burn.. /s

HURR DURR GET OFF MAH INTERNETZ YOU DAMN INTUHLECTCHULLS 














 No, you did not.  I was seeking a specific answer about the relationship between two quite specific statements, and you gave an unsolicited and rather condescending refutation of a view that I have not expressed at all. 




  gaviscon

There is no reason to use it unless you suffer acid reflux.  Neutralizing your stomach acid won't prevent irritation by alcohols.

Mixing them pure in a container until they solubilize and then blend the mixture with the desired amount of water would work? 

Yes.  If you want to be careful about it, add water slowly and watch for cloudiness or a precipitate forming.  If either occurs, you've found out how much water you can add before one of your substances falls out of solution (and you can add a little PG or alcohol to bring it back in).

I wouldn't be so concerned about using a little ethanol to accomplish this instead of PG.  The amount you'd need to dissolve an active dose should be far below a threshold dose of ethanol. 




 :-/

You didn't address my inquiry - nor do you know anything in particular about does or doesn't rustle my jimmies.  My comment is consistent with a wide variety of affective states, many of which would leave my jimmies undisturbed. 




 Blood pressure naturally varies within the range you've described, due to a wide variety of factors.  Standing, sitting, moving, thinking about exciting or boring topics, and of course expectations (placebo) can all effect changes of the magnitude you describe.

Your own expectations, in particular, could easily explain a consistent self-experimental finding of any dietary factor influencing blood pressure within that range.  It really doesn't make sense to believe that you know the cause of the changes you've observed. 




   Garlic is probably the best of the bunch with a couple of raw cloves leading to a transient drop of ~10/5mmHg. 4-8 stalks of celery/day also might be good for ~5 but isn't consistent.

Where did you get this data?  Is this from you monitoring yourself? 




 Bad advice.  Don't take an experimental proprietary supplement because it helped some random stranger on the internet - you should make important decisions about your health, which could add or remove decades from your life, on the basis of strong evidence. 




 Go ahead, if it's what you really want.  You've obviously given it some thought, and who is anybody to tell you they know better about what you should do with your life?

But you might consider that person with no qualms about dying is in a position of power that is quite rare, which could be used to do great things.  Perhaps you don't care about doing great things, but from your comment it sounds like actually you do - you care a lot about what's happening in the world, and wish that it were different.  So maybe you should do something about it instead of just ending your life passively.
 




 I'd drop everything you have reason to believe may be raising your blood pressure for a couple weeks, and see if it changed anything.  Then I'd add it all back again regardless of the result, and note the change from that (if any).

It's pretty difficult to figure out what's going on with self experiments like this, so I definitely wouldn't start by looking for minor effects that each of these things may have on their own.

You should also investigate the things that doctors talk about when you have high blood pressure (i.e. body weight, exercise, stimulant drugs, and stress).  Obviously you're aware of these things, but you haven't been explicit about them.  It's possible that you need to address one or more of those factors, and that you *can't* deal with this using nutrition and supplements. 









 First, they don't conflict directly, but the common wording is unfortunate.

Please explain why they don't conflict, in your view.  It seems to me that you're simply deflecting the question, instead of addressing the apparent contradiction. 




  * Anything that incites harm or violence against an individual or group of people

 * Anything that harasses, bullies, or abuses an individual or group of people (these behaviors intimidate others into silence)

These two seem potentially quite problematic.

How are each of these terms defined?  Who decides what is in or out, and by what process?  Is that process transparent, and is there room for community input?

For example, some people see vehement disagreement in debate on a controversial subject as harassment, as in a Canadian legal case of harassment of Twitter that was in the news earlier this week.  That sort of definition would capture a great deal of content that I believe a majority of Redditors do not want censored. 









 The grammar in your second sentence was indeed quite poor. 




 I didn't even do that. :O 




 :'( 














 /u/duckmurderer 









 At least we are in agreement about one thing: OP needs to burn his house down. 




 She's on to you - it's only a matter of time before the police come.  You need to burn down your house immediately and flee to Belize. 




 Sure thing.

The online tripsit guide you linked is a much better document.  It offers clear, direct advice about what to do and what to avoid, and that advice seems likely to lead to positive results.  It does seem to suffer from an excessive negative emphasis, but then again, people don't come to online trip-sitting chat rooms because they're having a good experience - perhaps that emphasis is appropriate in this case. 




 I haven't seen any quality guides for trip-sitting in a general sense, though if you want to get substance-specific I believe there's some good material floating around for ecstasy users.

You might get some mileage out of this classic read on psychedelic use:

[Session Games People Play: A Manual for the Use of LSD](http://www.luminist.org/archives/session.htm)

It's not quite what you're looking for, but it does lay out many of the fundamental issues in facilitating fruitful psychedelic experiences in small groups.  Interestingly, much of the advice on trip-sitting I've seen online actually plays into one or more of the session-wasting "games" explicated in the article. 




 Not really a guide, though there is some useful information. But it seems to me that, if presented to an inexperienced user, that page would give a person all kinds of bad ideas.

For example, the page devotes excessive space and consideration to psychotic reactions (which are extremely rare), to active guidance (which is usually inappropriate and counterproductive), and to danger (which is practically non-existent in many cases, but widely misunderstood). 




 Turn off the computer and lights, lie down, and close your eyes.  It's no good trying to do *anything* during a 3rd plateau DXM experience; you'll only interfere with what's happening.  Don't worry - just lie down and drift away... 



















 Well...yeah, that is ad hominem.  The only relevance your post has is to whatever claims of expertise OP made - but most of their post does not depend on any such claim. 




 /u/TEHNETS **ANGRY!!** 




 Someone's being a negative Nancy... 




 I think the idea is to vaporize, and that some cannabinoids are bronchodialators.

But you know, when I vaporize cannabis, I get fucking high.  I don't think inhalers do that....maybe that's the appeal. 




 I couldn't say - she's not my wife!  I didn't write the article.

But I imagine it may have something to do with the marijuana not being as effective a medicine for asthma as those inhalers... 














 Good point; it does seem like the author was sort of looking for a story on this topic, and found it in this. 




 Yeah...I'm willing to bet they've looked into that, and that they know more about her asthma triggers than we do. 




 I suppose that could be.  Sounds like one of the more interesting, if sadly dystopian, ways current politics could play out. 









 I've been vegetarian for about a decade, and nobody has ever yelled at me about it.  I've had plenty of conversations, though.  I generally deflect if it's around a meal, because people who eat meat seem to invariably get quite upset if they have to talk about the ethics of eating meat while eating.

Many people have pressed the issue over the years, though.  I find they shut up quick if I just tell them why I don't eat animals:
 "I don't want to cause animals to be raised in inhumane conditions and then killed, just to satisfy my desire to eat their meat.  I'd rather eat something else."

Can't really argue with a person who's done nothing but share their feelings. 









 **Everybody deserves good acid! :D** 




 Don't you think it's a bit naive for you to offer a one-line solution to such a long-standing, complex problem?  Without any evidence, no less?

It's pretty easy to poke holes in, too.  Hey, what if all the foreign workers keep being prostitutes, but just drop out of the legal system!  Huh...now your solution sounds a lot like...prohibition!  Which, incidentally, I did not advocate for. 




 Yes - /u/uvvapp has failed to establish any clear means of distinguishing which cases of employment are bodily exploitation and which are not.  For example, what about construction workers in developing nations?  Or [these kids in India who tear apart ships?](https://youtu.be/qhIaEEW63Sc?t=3m42s)  Are they in, or out?  Why? 




 I disagree that regulation is always necessary, but I certainly resonate with your view that there are strong parallels in completely unrelated industries - prostitution isn't unique in its possession of a vulnerable workforce.  But of course, it is unique in other ways, just like whichever manual labor intensive industry you work in.  They each require some care. 




 I don't disagree, but then again, I also didn't say anything about the morality of prostitution... 




 No; I'm afraid it isn't that simple.  That's why we both wrote more than one short sentence each - your summary does not accurately reflect the conversation. 




 Did you watch the documentary?  It's about a country with legalized, very loosely regulated prostitution. :-/

If you believe that Germany's laws about prostitution are the *cause* of human trafficking and coercion of German prostitutes, I challenge you to give specific evidence to support that claim. 




 I don't think the exploitative aspect is any different in the way you've framed it.  But it is, I think, much more horrible for a sex worker than it is for most other workers.  Consider the interviews with the prostitutes that they included - those women seem obviously traumatized in a way most workers are not.

https://youtu.be/QUBQLPgQ2RA?t=5m25s

https://youtu.be/QUBQLPgQ2RA?t=8m20s

So while I agree that the *exploitation* isn't really any different from most other employment, I'm sympathetic to the view that prostitution may require strict regulation to protect the workers from the trauma of that line of work.

And there is some set of sex workers who are being exploited in further ways, such as human trafficking.  This is obviously not what you're talking about, but is another reason to call for intervention. 




 There is better evidence for the safety of occasional moderate to high doses of psychedelics than there is for regular low-dose use, simply because regular low-dose use is not common.

That said, there is little reason to expect neurotoxicity.  You're correct that their mechanism of action is quite different from those of amphetamine and MDMA, and that MDMA and amphetamine induced neurotoxicity is not evidence for psychedelic induced neurotoxicity.  Note that amphetamine is known to have the potential to induce lasting neurotoxicity in doses not much higher than those used therapeutically, and is strongly habit-forming and addictive.  LSD has neither of these marks against it, and is likely a safer bet if you can verify your supply and dosage. 









 hurr durr, get off mah internetz you goddam inteellec-chul 




 The real question is, is supporting a mildly socialist, with some damning imperialist tendencies more important than alienating international allies?

I don't believe that this *is* the real question, or even a genuine question. It's just a false dilemma; a cheap rhetorical device.  What international allies will be alienated if American anarchists offer qualified support and thoughtful criticism to Bernie Sanders?

Perhaps none!  If we behave reasonably and with tact, I doubt that any valuable ally would be lost - as such a person would surely recognize the strategic value of offering qualified support in order to make incremental political gains. 




 Fair enough; thank you for clarifying. 




 Like the clear argument so eloquently displayed above:

What the fuck is your problem? You actually have something relevant to say, or are you just here to be a troll?

Surely the speaker of this fine example of enlightened reason would never come off as an asshole! 




 Hey, no need to be such a dick.  You know what I had to say?  I had two sarcastic remarks about a pretentious and infantile quotation of a line from an old song by Tool.

Oh my god - somebody said something sarcastic and irreverent in the face of a profound quotation in /r/psychonaut - she must be an asshole, and we must downvote and attack her.

This absurdly childish and hateful reaction is evidence enough to me that my comment was relevant and substantive. 




 They're well worth a listen. 




 :/ 




 Hey, no need to be a dick about it 




 Hey - no need to be a dick about it. 




 The Rothschild political cartoon is not what /u/wumsdi is addressing - it is the title quote.  Click the link - it contains a reasoned dissection of the origins of the title quote, which is not what it is presented to be. 




 As much as I appreciate the sentiment, this is not an appropriate way to seek political support.  Your post is essentially spam. 




 Enjoy your safe space, stoners 




 That isn't the point.  I don't have a problem with the video.  The point is that /u/GarrottedClown is advancing a plainly false view. 




 Huh...well, I guess that's one way to go about arguing a point. :/

The initial permission you're referencing in no way contradicts the permissionless innovation idea - after that (blanketed and unconstrained) permission was granted, there was no need for individuals to ask permission before implementing a new idea.  Anybody with $ could start a web-based business with almost no regulatory overhead.

That the internet developed out of ARPAnet, etc, is no contradiction to that. 




 Oh my god what is this band - it's so good, and I definitely haven't spent hours listening to them before like every other psychedelic enthusiast that came of age in the last 20 years. /s 




  Video is a depiction of what is actually happening. If your conscience is clear, these things shouldn't bother you.

That is just not right.  That video bothered the fuck out of me for reasons that have nothing to do with my own guilt (I have none, in this case).  It is disturbing to see horrible things happen, regardless of one's personal responsibility. 




 Whoah duuude....I'm like soooo high right now... 




 It depends on how strictly the law will apply.  Would any business with California customers have to get a license, or would it only apply to businesses with a physical presence in California?

If it is the former case, then we can expect a ton of businesses to simply deny service to California. 




 Depends on how you look at it.  You can't deny that there was a period of massive growth in the 1990s that had very little to do with military spending. 




 Anarchists have a long proud history of critiquing even socialism for its flaws, instead of jumping right in and supporting every revolution.

This is a false dichotomy, and has little relevance to the OP.  Anarchists can critique Bernie Sanders without actively alienating all his supporters.  They can even critique him and also support his run for president.

Thats a terrible way to look at things, and a very invalid comparison.

**Why?**  It seems like a fair comparison to me, and you haven't offered any specific reason why it is flawed.  

Bernie Sanders is shifting the political debate in America to include a somewhat liberal perspective.  That's a good thing for anarchists, because it makes our ideas slightly more accessible to the mainstream, and closer to admission to mainstream political debate.  It's a gift.

If we ignore that gift, and even degrade it and alienate those who support these somewhat liberal ideas, then we are essentially behaving as though we believe anarchist society will come without any incremental political gains (or that we don't care whether anarchist society ever happens).  That is extremely naive, as I think OP has shown.  Even if revolution occurred without any prior liberalization, it is very difficult to imagine a way it could play out that would favor anarchism.  Anarchists would be outgunned and outnumbered by more militant groups with greater mass appeal in the current political climate.

So it seems to me that the alternative to seeking incremental change is to hope for a lucky win, and OP's metaphor seems pretty good.

...

His Israel stance is obnoxious and needs to go. As an American its really easy for me to support this because the chances of finding any canidate that doesn't have their mouth around Israel's cock is slim to none. Sanders and his background in Israeli Kibutzim, and notorious attachment to Israel make my endorsement embarassing to any socialist who is not American.

It doesn't matter.  All viable American presidential candidates will serve the Israel lobby; there is no other option.

Typical liberal gun control stance. He's at least admitted its racialist, where most other libs don't do as much.

Again, it doesn't matter.  Any viable Democratic candidate will have the standard Democrat gun control stance.

If things like this make a candidate unacceptable, then there will simply never be an acceptable candidate.  If that is your approach to supporting politicians, then you have no possibility whatsoever to effect positive change through the political process.  That is a poor strategy in the current political climate, imo - sometimes a candidate is better for anarchism than another, despite failings such as those above. 




 You're welcome!  I've never seen l-theanine at reasonable prices in local stores, though it is often available at supplement stores where they exist.  But it's quite cheap and easy to obtain online; sites like Purebulk, Powdercity, and the ubiquitous Amazon   Ebay are all good sources. 




 The only active component is the caffeine, and perhaps the B-complex in some weak synergy with it.  The extra B12 is pure waste; it will do exactly nothing unless you are deficient, and if you are deficient, you should see a doctor and receive better treatment.

Regarding the caffeine...200mcg is a sub-threshold dose, so I assume you mean 200mg.  200mg of caffeine is a fairly normal dose for a tolerant user.  You should be concerned in the same way you would be when taking your 5hr energy drink, which I believe has the same dose of caffeine.

In other words: if you are healthy now, you should consider alternate approaches in the medium to long-term to avoid increasing your risk of cardiovascular disease.  If you are already at risk for cardiovascular disease, you should probably stop using caffeine.

Since you seem to like supplements, you might be interested in l-theanine and its synergistic relationship with caffeine.  L-theanine is a cheap, amino-acid-like supplement that is found in green tea, which has a balancing effect when taken with caffeine.  It seems to reduce the negative side effects - such as anxiety and paradoxical distraction - which normally accompany caffeine in moderate to high doses.  But it doesn't reduce caffeine's stimulatory and cognitive enhancing effects.  A couple hundred mg of theanine could greatly improve your stack. 




 It is worth worrying about, but perhaps not in the exact way you're worrying about it.   Where are you getting these ideas about ideal ratios and so on?

Most clinical research I've seen is addressed to dosages, not to omega 3 / 6 ratios.  It probably makes more sense to follow a dosage guideline derived from research, such as you would find on a public health web site. 




 That isn't true.  You haven't even specified the dosage in each pill, nor the dietary intake of omega 6 - both of which vary dramatically.

A person who doesn't eat junk food, uses non-omega 6 heavy oils, and doesn't eat nut butters may well have a single-digit daily intake of omega 6.  Concentrated fish oil pills can easily contain half a gram of omega-3.

1-1 ratio isn't necessarily difficult to hit.  It also isn't necessarily desirable. 




 I guess Rand Paul has had enough small, limited federal government now that his eyes are on the prize.  Sigh... 









 You can't.

But since the mid-00's to present there has always been at least one dried, powdered, high potency plant source that drops right in to prevailing kitchen chemistry techniques available on ebay.  Probably Amazon as well.  So you only have to make one internet purchase to do this, that purchase is a tried and tested reasonably safe purchase, and you can probably do it with a prepaid nameless card.

Everything else you need is at the hardware store etc, as you already seem to know. 









 Congratulations.  Feels good to do what you know is right. :) 




 Eh, no need to be a dick about it. 




  I find it absolutely ridiculous to argue that a society that doesn't attend Lion's Club meetings or goes to NASCAR events is incapable of thinking for themselves.

I agree!  But the article never argued this point - it's entirely your own. 




 I know what you mean.  I think you've given a good example of how social media platforms can isolate people and undermine discussion.  But then again, this discussion would never have happened at all without Reddit, and the cost was very low; it also serves as a counter-example to the article's main point. 




 I disagree.  It's an infantile attempt to prove a point with a contrived white savior story that did not happen, and would be objectionable if it had. 




 Theoretically, yes.  But it would be worth looking into whether there is direct evidence for this before choosing it as a routine method of supplementing magnesium.  It's worth mentioning, as well, that magnesium citrate often produces diarrhea - which can disrupt the absorption of just about anything. 




  I don't agree with his objections to electronic images, however. Many of those people staring at their phones are interacting with other people, and not just consuming corporate entertainment. Also, electronic recordings, such as those of Eric Garner and Walter Scott, are extremely important to the mass movements of today.

I agree with this objections, but also recognize what you've said: those electronic images are not necessarily a bad thing.  I don't think the author would disagree with that - it's quite obvious, really.

I would like to have seen this article in a longer form, explicating a more nuanced view that differentiates between genuine political participation and social interaction via the internet, and all the other uses of internet that he bemoaned. 




  It is tempting to bemoan our isolation and claim young people are brainwashed or isolated, but I think the line between corporatist propaganda and socialization is blurry when most of my interactions with friends, family and colleagues are done on social media. Using those platforms does expose me to advertising, but I use an adblocker, so that's a moot point. 

The author doesn't get into this at all, but I think he could have address this by discussing how the *structure* of social media has been shaped to produce some of the negative changes he's described in our society.  The content isn't handed down to you, but through it's structure the platform produces highly stereotyped content that seems to produce isolation, distraction, and a lack of genuine political and social participation.

This is something that has been written about at length by many others, but usually without invoking this broader sociopolitical context - what the author of this article discussed as corporate totalitarianism.

What do you think?  Are all those interactions on social media a contradiction to the author's point, or could they perhaps support it? 




 Hehe...somebody's feeling a bit defensive. :P

I honestly did not perceive any sense of blame in the article - I didn't take it as a moralistic piece.  Of course, the author expresses their belief that the current trajectory of our society is worrying, and should be averted.  But besides that claim, it seemed like a plainly *descriptive* article to me - the author explicates their view of a set of social processes, and what he believes to be their cause.
