 I'm gonna be honest and say that I don't really believe in ghosts, but  it'd be pretty awesome if something changed my mind. 




 Yep that's the site I've been looking at lol.  




 Would anyone be interested in YouTube videos, stories, photos, or anything like that? There's quite a few of them around here, and I'm thinking of making something of a series about it. Any suggestions? 




 I did email them, they've just ignored it so far lol 




 I've got number 114, I was just curious about how many were actually produced lol. 




 I feel like you're referring to his head... 




 So, I've been without a job for a bit now, and I can't justify spending money on things I don't need. I've got money for bills and such, but my home is definitely more important than vaping lol. Calling on the kindness of a stranger to help me out of a tight spot. Anything you might be giving I'm taking! Thanks for reading (: 




 I'd like to start off by saying I'll only get tattoos professionally, but are scratchers really that bad? I don't mean your tape player engine with a guitar string, I mean a legitimate artist with a legitimate gun, but between jobs or something like that. It just seems like most people take a stance where it isn't okay no matter what. What kind of problems do people typically run into in these situations?  




 Don't downvote him guys, he just ran out of bombies. We've all been there 




 Lol do you even vape? Those cloudz are weeaakk 




 I can try God Damnit!  




 I picked it up for 65 in Lancaster Ohio at upright vapor 




 Dual parallel royal wire 20g 7 wrap lol 









 Reminds me of a certain game I just lost... 




 Hello, I was homeless for a long time, and I know how hard it can be. I've been meaning to pass this knowledge on to people who can use it, so here it is. Panera bread! Most panera bread's donate to local food shelters, but significantly more often than you might think the shelters don't show up to take it. They wrap everything in two or three layers of plastic before they throw it out. They throw everything out at about 10 to 11pm from the previous day, so it's still fairly fresh. Panera pretty much kept me alive for a long time, so I'm hoping it can help someone else. Thanks for reading! 




 Sorry, I've kinda got a general idea of a nerf herder in my mind. Please forgive me for being so prejudice :( 




 See who? 




 Leave it to a scruffy nerf herder to judge your hygiene. 









 Should've expected Jorge to be involved... 




 So long, thanks for all the- fuck
