 Nope. You are from Troy! 




 So true on it all! I was just throwing in my 2 cents in case any readers went all doom gloom re. H5N1.

There have been reports of the growing cost of eggs, here is a sampling:

 Just for the record:)    FAQs: H5N1 influenza
 
 Q1: What is H5N1?

H5N1 is a type of influenza virus that causes a highly infectious, severe respiratory disease in birds called avian influenza (or "bird flu"). Human cases of H5N1 avian influenza occur occasionally, but it is difficult to transmit the infection from person to person. When people do become infected, the mortality rate is about 60%.

Q2: How does H5N1 influenza spread to people?

Almost all cases of H5N1 infection in people have been associated with close contact with infected live or dead birds, or H5N1-contaminated environments. The virus does not infect humans easily, and spread from person to person appears to be unusual. There is no evidence that the disease can be spread to people through properly prepared and thoroughly cooked food.

The results belong to everyone equally, says Milner, adding that transparency is particularly important in a project searching for aliens because there are so many conspiracy theorists.

He also plans a Breakthrough Message competition  offering a $1-million pool of prize money  to construct a digital message to transmit to potential extraterrestrials (though there is no commitment to sending out the message)."

 "...the largest group looking for life, the SETI Institute, doesn't receive any government funding, and this particular aspect of space exploration has seen dwindling support.".

    

















































 Please prove me wrong??

As I read the original article I saw this quote: 
 
  "Pearl Jones, 81, said Friday she received a handwritten letter from Tonia Sonju, manager of Carlyn Estates Mobile Home Park in Palmetto, ordering her to stop taking deliveries of food from the nearby Hope Church, which was bringing boxes to about a dozen homes in the park, or she would face eviction." 

So apparently Ms Sonju is representing herself as 'manager' to the tenants.  

Did you read the links?  Ms Sonju is the principal of Glucklich, LLC.

    Its about the porches flooding every time it rains. 
    
    It is about residents being locked out of the club house for 3 months. 
    
    It is about bullies getting drunk and harassing residents, it is about people being evicted with out just cause. or then numerous trailers that have been sold with out tittles. it is about the owner telling people who they may associate with and if seen you are harassed. 
   
    It is about following people and embarrassing them for reaching out for help.
   
    It is about them telling people no one needs food in this park. 
   
    It is about a Disabled vet being threatened by her employee and her standing by and doing nothing about it. There is a video that clearly shows it.

 MADRID (AP)  Spain and Portugal  known for their sunny skies  are seeing record high temperatures for May, with thermometers hitting levels normally only seen in midsummer.

Spain's meteorological agency says the eastern town of Xativa recorded 42.9 degrees Celsius (109.2 Fahrenheit) on Thursday, breaking a 2006 record of 40.1 degrees Celsius (104.2 Fahrenheit) at Cordoba Airport.

Portugal also set a May record, with the southern city of Beja sizzling Wednesday in 40 degrees Celsius heat. Portugal's previous May high was 39.5 degrees Celsius (103.1 Fahrenheit) in 2011.

The stifling heat stretched across to Spain's Canary Islands in the Atlantic Ocean, where temperatures of 42.4 degrees Celsius (108.3 Fahrenheit) were recorded Wednesday at Lanzarote Airport.

The town of Pego in Spain's eastern Alicante region was also fighting a wildfire Friday. 














 An outbreak of lead poisoning in Nigeria has killed 28 young children in Niger state, health officials told local media Wednesday. At least 65 cases were identified in Niger state, where the poisoning was linked to illegal mining. Although lead poisoning is not contagious, officials expressed concern that the affects had already spread into neighboring Kaduna state.

As of Tuesday, 17 girls and 11 boys all under the age of five have died from lead poisoning and more sick children are being treated. Farm animals were also affected by the lead poisoning outbreak, junior health minister Fidelis Nwankwo said Wednesday.

The devastating impact of this outbreak is associated with new mining sites, which were found to contain more leaded ores, which are often brought home for crushing and processing, Nwankwo told reporters during a press conference in Abuja. Additionally, the finding revealed a serious impact on our livestock with cows, goats and chicken most affected.

Illegal gold mining is a lucrative business for impoverished locals, who have concealed or denied fatalities and sickness from lead poisoning in fear of consequences. Local who bring rocks inside their homes and use unsafe mining techniques to process gold ore are at risk for lead exposure. Lead poisoning cannot be spread from person-to-person, but lead-containing particles can be transported and thus inhaled or ingested by more people.

[The outbreak] is currently spreading to neighboring localities in the state and Kaduna state, Nwankwo added.

Lead poisoning has killed hundreds of Nigerian children in recent years. In 2010, at least 400 children died and some 2,000 others affected from lead poisoning in Zamfara. The outbreak was caused by the processing of lead-containing gold ore in the northwestern state and lead contamination was identified in about 50 villages. The dangerous mining practice produced fine particles that contaminated water and food crops and were easily consumed by young children, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.

When inhaled or ingested, lead can cause damage to the brain, kidneys, bone marrow and other body systems in young children, the CDC said in a report last year.

(IBT was annoying me today, so this is a copy/paste if you prefer. Or here is another source:http://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/nigeria-28-kids-killed-lead-poisoning-gold-mining-31063970)

I am irl, but I suck at it on the net, so I have mostly given up :) 




 Whoa. Hold up.

The meningitis outbreak is in Niger I thought...Yes Niger has meningitis, Nigeria to Niger's south, has the H5N1 outbreak.

Also ..No more Ebola in Nigeria:)  So that is good.

 TESTIMONIALS

We Have Found You Wanting

By Rose Schneiderman

Addressing the same audience [a memorial meeting held in the Metropolitan Opera House on April 2, 1911], Schneiderman (1866-1972), organizer for the ILGWU and the Women's Trade Union League read the handwriting on the wall. First published in The Survey, April 8, 1911.

I would be a traitor to these poor burned bodies if I came here to talk good fellowship. We have tried you good people of the public and we have found you wanting.

The old Inquisition had its rack and its thumbscrews and its instruments of torture with iron teeth. We know what these things are today; the iron teeth are our necessities, the thumbscrews are the high-powered and swift machinery close to which we must work, and the rack is here in the firetrap structures that will destroy us the minute they catch on fire.

This is not the first time girls have been burned alive in the city. Every week I must learn of the untimely death of one of my sister workers. Every year thousands of us are maimed. The life of men and women is so cheap and property is so sacred. There are so many of us for one job it matters little if 146 of us are burned to death.

We have tried you citizens; we are trying you now, and you have a couple of dollars for the sorrowing mothers, brothers and sisters by way of a charity gift. But every time the workers come out in the only way they know to protest against conditions which are unbearable the strong hand of the law is allowed to press down heavily upon us.

Public officials have only words of warning to us--warning that we must be intensely peaceable, and they have the workhouse just back of all their warnings. The strong hand of the law beats us back, when we rise, into the conditions that make life unbearable.

I can't talk fellowship to you who are gathered here. Too much blood has been spilled. I know from my experience it is up to the working people to save themselves. The only way they can save themselves is by a strong working-class movement.

 Key facts

Avian influenza (AI), commonly called bird flu, is an infectious viral disease of birds.

Most avian influenza viruses do not infect humans; however some, such as A(H5N1) and A(H7N9), have caused serious infections in people.

Outbreaks of AI in poultry may raise global public health concerns due to their effect on poultry populations, their potential to cause serious disease in people, and their pandemic potential.

Reports of highly pathogenic AI epidemics in poultry, such as A(H5N1), can seriously impact local and global economies and international trade.

The majority of human cases of A(H5N1) and A(H7N9) infection have been associated with direct or indirect contact with infected live or dead poultry. There is no evidence that the disease can be spread to people through properly cooked food.

Controlling the disease in animals is the first step in decreasing risks to humans.

(IMHO you may also be seeing a good price increase in food such as eggs, chicken, turkey, duck, etc. Not an expert!)  









 I seem to have misread your's as well:) 




 Actually..I'm more responding to your original statement:)

 




 In my experience, when people and their children are hungry they will work under the most horrid conditions, even at the risk of their life.

Also how often do we hear people that are the victims of awful events say, "You hear about this on the news. I never expected it would happen to me."

I'm pretty sure the workers there recognized a danger.  




 we haven't seen pissed off yet! (sorry it reads as 'distant')

  President Obama said the prospect of peace between Israel and the Palestinians is now "distant," but "A two-state solution is absolutely vital ... for the long-term security of Israel as a Democratic and Jewish state."

He said he was aware that some members of the newly formed Israeli government "don't necessarily believe in that premise ... but that continues to be my premise."

 "CAMP DAVID, Md.  President Obama on Thursday offered Saudi Arabia and smaller states in the Arab world new defenses against potential missile attacks and maritime and cyberthreats from Iran, an effort to allay their fears that a nuclear accord with Tehran will empower their main rival in the Middle East.

But in a daylong meeting here, Mr. Obama stopped short of offering a formal defense pact that would obligate the United States to come to the nations aid if they were attacked."

 Completely unrelated Cyprus fun-fact from wiki:

" The Government has invested heavily in the creation of water desalination plants which have supplied almost 50 per cent of domestic water since 2001. Efforts have also been made to raise public awareness of the situation and to encourage domestic water users to take more responsibility for the conservation of this increasingly scarce commodity.

Turkey is building a water pipeline under the Mediterranean Sea from Anamur on its southern coast to the northern coast of Cyprus, to supply Northern Cyprus with potable and irrigation water (see Northern Cyprus Water Supply Project)."

 




 The hailstorm that lasted about half an hour, destroyed vineyards and half-grown tree crops and grain in Paphos, and cherry crops in Kampos tis Tsakkistras and Amiandos in Nicosia.

According to reports, vine growers said the damage was so extensive that their vineyards will not be able to produce grapes next year either.

 Exactly, this is worrisome. 




 The carefully negotiated bill, which President Obama is expected to sign, gives Congress the power to approve or disapprove of a nuclear agreement with Iran during a 30-day period when economic sanctions could not be lifted.

Should the House and Senate vote to disapprove of the deal, and then override a likely Obama veto, the administration would be barred from waiving some economic sanctions on Iran as part of international accord.

There is a potential for isolated thunderstorms with dangerous lightning, small hail, gusty erratic winds, and isolated water spouts, a statement from the weather service said.

She does not expect the conditions to improve over the next few days. 

"What's challenging fire suppression efforts is this is the second year in a row that we've had higher than normal drought conditions in this region which is making this fire gain momentum as it burns through these very dense forest fuel," she says.'
