 Well, I'm especially looking forward to Cemetery of Splendor (2015) by Apichatpong Weerasethakul, Right Now, Wrong Then (2015) by Hong Sang-soo and Taxi (2015) by Jafar Panahi. The films by Panahi and Weerasethakul have already been screened at various festivals, but none of them have been released on DVD/Blu-ray yet, so I'm waiting for that. Hopefully I'll get to see all three movies by the end of the year. 









 Check out these great directors:    

* Andrei Tarkovsky        
* Bla Tarr                
* Theo Angelopoulos              

They have lots of long tracking shot in most of their movies. Some recommendations:    

* Andrei Rublev (1966)   
* Damnation (1988)    
* Landscape in the Mist (1988)   
* Nostalghia (1983)    
* Stntang (1994)     
* Solaris (1972)   
* Stalker (1979)   
* The Sacrifice (1986)    
* The Travelling Players (1975)   
* The Turin Horse (2011)    
* Ulysses' Gaze (1995)      
* Werckmeister Harmonies (2000)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykpJkf76X04    
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB7RUwZuDZc    

To also give you another idea, Stntang (1994) by Tarr is almost 8 hours long and there are roughly only 150 shots in the whole movie. 




 Paris, Texas (1984) and Tokyo Story (1953). 




 Stalker (1979) by Andrei Tarkovsky. 




 Odd list. I really don't know what to say if someone includes movies like The Last Samurai (2003) and 47 Ronin (2013) on a top list of the best samurai movies ever made. Anyways, if I made my own list, I would for sure include these five at least:   

* Harakiri (1962) *(Masaki Kobayashi)*      
* Pandemonium (1971) *(Toshio Matsumoto)*   
* The Loyal 47 Ronin (1941) *(Kenji Mizoguchi)*   
* Sword of Doom (1966) *(Kihachi Okamoto)*   
* Three Outlaw Samurai (1964) *(Hideo Gosha)*    




 Well, you probably know about Tarkovsky's other movies by now, but be sure to check out Letters from a Dead Man (1986) and Visitor of a Museum (1989) by Konstantin Lopushanskiy if you want something that's also science fiction and similar to Tarkovky's films. Lopushanskiy actually worked as an assistant director on Stalker (1979).      

Come and See (1985) and The Ascent (1976) are two other recommendations if you want great war films. And when it comes to the silent days of Soviet cinema, I recommend Bed and Sofa (1927) and Battleship Potemkin (1925). 




 If you liked that Dassin movie, check out some of his other films, especially Brute Force (1947) and Night and the City (1950). Pickup on South Street (1953) by Samuel Fuller could be up your alley too. 




 Michael Haneke. 




 Teizo Matsumura: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBB1vlExQFo 




 I have seen 98 of them. The Shanghai Gesture (1941) by Josef von Sternberg and 25th Hour (2002) by Spike Lee are the ones I haven't seen yet, although I've seen several other movies by the two directors. 




 I would pick 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Solaris (1972) for their scales, set designs and photography as two of my favourites. The [opening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qGI9E70Pe4) scene from Solaris (1972) pretty much shows how fantastic Tarkovsky was on a visual level, even if he was fantastic when it came to everything else too. Amazing and dreamlike atmosphere. 




 Some great examples are Jack Nicholson, Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, Udo Kier, and Harvey Keitel. 




 Well, the first one is a Czechoslovakian movie from the Czech New Wave that is set in 1930s Prague, where the cremator Karel Kopfrkingl lives and works. Because of the Czechoslovakian situation with Nazi Germany and his crematorium, he gains some advantages. But when he discovers that his wife and daughter both have Jewish blood, he starts turning against them. Kind of a mix between horror, drama and comedy, it also takes some influences from German Expressionist. A masterpiece!      


The second one is set in during a civil war in the fourteenth century somwhere in Japan. It's about two women who are killing samurai men and selling their belongings for a living. One of them is having an affair with a neighbor, while the other one meets a mysterious samurai with a mask. This will also threaten their friendship. Great atmosphere and a very moody soundtrack. I love how it's shot in the very high susuki grass.         


The third one is about a surgeon called Dr. Gnessier who is kidnapping and killing women, only to obtain faces for his daughter Christiane, a young girl that got her whole face spoiled in a car crash. Bizarre, yet beautiful.     
 

The fourth one is another one from Kaneto Shind, who also directed Onibaba (1964). Just like Onibaba (1964), this one is also about two women, but more of a ghost story. The two women in this movie are raped and killed by samurai soldiers, and after that, they reappear as ghosts in the form of cats to seduce and brutally murder the passing samurai. And just like Onibaba (1964), this one is just as stylistic and great.        


And yeah, now we're at the last one, Possession (1981). A story about a woman who starts to show disturbing and strange behaviors after asking her husband for a divorce. The suspicions of infidelity soon give way to something much more sinister and bizarre. I'm not going to spoil anymore about it, it's just not needed. Very special flick. Especially Isabelle Adjani is amazing in this one. Chaotic and thrilling with great camera work. If you like Cronenberg and Lynch, this is something you must check out. 




 Woody Allen. 




 Some examples:   

* Irm Hermann   Eva Mattes:      
The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant (1972)   Woyzeck (1979)    

* Tatsuya Nakadai   Toshir Mifune:        
Sword of Doom (1966), High and Low (1963)   Yojimbo (1961)   

* Setsuko Hara   S Yamamura:      
Sound of the Mountain (1954)   Tokyo Story (1953)       

* Kuniko Miyake   Chish Ry:     
Late Spring (1949), Flavor of Green Tea Over Rice (1952), Good Morning (1959)   The Golden Demon (1937) 




 1. The Cremator (1969) *(Juraj Herz)*   
2. Onibaba (1964) *(Kaneto Shind)*    
3. Eyes Without a Face (1960) *(Georges Franju)*    
4. Kuroneko (1968) *(Kaneto Shind)*   
5. Possession (1981) *(Andrzej Zulawski)*    




 Woody Allen and David Lynch, that would just be amazing, surreal and funny. 




 1. The Seventh Continent (1989)    
2. Andrei Rublev (1966)    
3. L'eclisse (1962)   
4. Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)    
5. The Face of Another (1966)    




 I think my list would look something like this:    

1. Andrei Rublev (1966) *(Andrei Tarkovsky)*   
2. Pickpocket (1959) *(Robert Bresson)*   
3. An Autumn Afternoon (1962) *(Yasujir Ozu)*   
4. L'eclisse (1962) *(Michelangelo Antonioni)*   
5. Eros Plus Massacre (1969) *(Yoshishige Yoshida)*    




 Well, I'm absolutely going to watch those three you mentioned, but here are some other movies from this year that I'm looking more forward to and that I've put on my watchlist:      

* Aferim! (2015) *(Radu Jude)*      
* Cemetery of Splendor (2015) *(Apichatpong Weerasethakul)*   
* Cosmos (2015) *(Andrzej Zulawski)*    
* Eisenstein in Guanajuato (2015) *(Peter Greenaway)*   
* El Club (2015) *(Pablo Larran)*   
* Every Thing Will Be Fine (2015) *(Wim Wenders)*   
* Far from the Madding Crowd (2015) *(Thomas Vinterberg)*   
* In the Shadow of Women (2015) *(Philippe Garrel)*   
* Irrational Man (2015) *(Woody Allen)*   
* Le Louvre sous lOccupation (2015) *(Aleksandr Sokurov)*    
* Mountains May Depart (2015) *(Jia Zhangke)*    
* My Mother (2015) *(Nanni Moretti)*   
* Nahid (2015) *(Ida Panahandeh)*      
* Our Little Sister (2015) *(Hirokazu Koreeda)*   
* Queen of the Desert (2015) *(Werner Herzog)*   
* Right Now, Wrong Then (2015) *(Hong Sang-soo)*        
* Schneider vs. Bax (2015) *(Alex van Warmerdam)*   
* Seances (2015) *(Guy Maddin)*   
* Sweet Red Bean Paste (2015) *(Naomi Kawase)*   
* Taxi (2015) *(Jafar Panahi)*   
* The Assassin (2015) *(Hou Hsiao-hsien)*   
* The Forbidden Room (2015) *(Guy Maddin)*    
* The Pearl Button (2015) *(Patricio Guzmn)*    
* The Treasure (2015) *(Corneliu Porumboiu)*   
* Youth (2015) *(Paolo Sorrentino)*   

Some of them have been already screened at various festivals, so I'm mostly waiting for DVD/Blu-ray releases, because they'll probably not be shown anywhere near me. We'll see when they will come out. Oh, I also forgot about the new stuff from Miguel Gomes that's in three parts. Also, Lav Diaz is working on a new movie. I also hope Michael Haneke, Aki Kaurismki and Abbas Kiarostami are going to release some new flicks soon, I just don't know if it's going to be this year. 




 I'm guessing that it won't be even near Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1925) by Fred Niblo or Ben-Hur (1959) by William Wyler when it comes to quality, even if those two aren't my favourite movies exactly. The new movie will be directed by someone who did Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter (2012) and Wanted (2008), and if my expectations were really low from the beginning, I probably can't find words for where they are now. Good luck to the guy if he even comes close to achieving Wyler's depth of field when it comes to the cinematography. The new movie will probably look like shit and be bad as well, I'm almost certain. 




 Good movie, yeah! Is it something special you are looking after? On an instant note, I would recommend looking into Michael Haneke's other films, like Benny's Video (1992) and Funny Games (1997). Another movie that is a bit similar is La crmonie (1995) by Claude Chabrol, it also features the great Isabelle Huppert as well. 




 It's got nothing to do with that. I'm talking about the saturation, contrast and brightness for example. Look at movies like Walkabout (1971) and Wake in Fright (1971) that perfectly captured the Australian outback without overworking it like they did in Mad Mad: Fury Road (2015). Even Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975) and The Last Wave (1977) did it visually, even though those two are not only set in the outback. With the technology and opportunities of today, I felt it was too bad that they just went with a typical mainstream movie look and oversaturized things with that orange and teal look, while those other movies I mentioned really could capture the dry outback look in more realistic and better looking ways, they didn't even need to change much. I know that the movie was supposed to be over the top in many ways, but the visuals could look much better and still fit in. 




 No No Sleep (2015) by Tsai Ming-liang. 




 Well, this is only my opinion, but because people everywhere were (and still are) going apeshit over it and seem to view it as one of the best movies of the last 10 years and every second Tom, Dick and Harry hands out the highest rating to it.        

Was it a horrible movie? Absolutely not. Was it one of the best movies I've seen in the last couple of years? Not even close to it. It was absolutely overhyped if you ask me. But then again, my taste is often not that close to the majority of Reddit and/or the mainstream audience/critics. I just feel that people are exaggerating. I gave it a (weak) 2 out of 5.      


If we take away all the action scenes that were supposed to be over the top all the time, it just felt like an empty and a bit silly over the top movie with not much to say really. A quite forgettable flick for me. And then I'm not a bit impressed by the action the movie had, and don't feel like it would compensate for anything either. I appreciate that Max was pretty much in the background and that Furiosa stole the show, because it's refreshing seeing female characters in this way in these kind of movies, but it wasn't fully without problems and couldn't lift the movie that much for me.     


And I don't really know about the thing concerning George Miller's vision. He even said himself that the best version of the movie should have been in black and white, but instead they still went with the disgusting and typical teal and orange that you can see in random Hollywood movie today. That was a shame. I think the saturation and brightness of some of the colors would have ended up looking a lot better too. It was at least better than your typical blockbuster, but that doesn't say too much anyways. 




 It's a very cool, smart and even funny science fiction film with a lot of interesting themes, such as the ones about artificial worlds and illusions. I have seen a big amount of Fassbinder films, but I wouldn't say that this one is the easiest to start with. I would rather recommend starting with something like Ali: Fear Eats the Soul (1974), The Merchant of Four Seasons (1972) or Fear of Fear (1975), just to get familiar with his style. World on a Wire (1973) is also a bit longer than those. With that said, it's totally up to you what you feel like, this is just a heads up from someone who has seen the majority of his films. 




 Mad Max: Fury Road (2015). 




 My Neighbor Totoro (1988). 




 Here's ten great ones:    

* Winter Light (1963) *(Ingmar Bergman)*   
* Pickpocket (1959) *(Robert Bresson)*   
* A Geisha (1953) *(Kenji Mizoguchi)*   
* Le rvlateur (1968) *(Philippe Garrel)*   
* Violated Angels (1967) *(Kji Wakamatsu)*

 Masculin Fminin (1966), Breathless (1960) and The Mother and the Whore (1973). 




 [Here](http://www.theyshootpictures.com/resources/StartingList.xls) is TSPDT's starting list of 13,664 films. 




 Three of my favourites:    

* A Zed   Two Noughts (1985): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sClBFDt4jSE   
* Rengoku eroica (1970): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiOnETIFQCY     
* Solyaris (1972): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qGI9E70Pe4      




 1. Werckmeister Harmonies (2000) *(Bla Tarr)*   
2. La Commune (Paris, 1871) (2000) *(Peter Watkins)*   
3. In Vanda's Room (2000) *(Pedro Costa)*   
4. In the Mood for Love (2000) *(Wong Kar-wai)*      
5. Virgin Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors (2000) *(Hong Sang-soo)*

 Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975), Le trou (1960), Andrei Rublev (1966) and the films by Teshigahara on Blu-ray as soon as possible would be great. 




  How do you start a movie 5 times and not manage to watch it full once?    

Maybe OP got stuck in a time loop. 
























 Do watch! Now! A beautiful and mellow movie. Ozu was a true master and everyone should see his films. 




 So it was that one? Great! Heh, I guess I just recognized it quite quick. It's a good movie! 




 I don't know. I thought it looked quite bad, like something you do in Photoshop when you're 14 years old and learning Photoshop. The abrupt line in the middle and the added grain felt quite amateurish as well. Nothing wrong with the composition and balance of the three lines of text, but all the lines of text could look better and have nicer fonts. But that's just me. 




 I didn't actually like the movie myself. It just seems that you were very disappointed and reacting surprised over the good reviews? As I said, people don't have the same taste, it's just simple as that. It's okay if you don't like certain movies and it's okay being disappointed over them. If you are wondering why some people liked it, you'll probably find the answer in their reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes for example, the Tomatometer for the movie is at 52%, which isn't really that high. 50 critics liked it and 46 didn't, so it's quite much in the middle on that site. 




 It sounds a bit like Targets (1968) by Peter Bogdanovich, could it be that one? 




  What I don't understand is how it can have good reviews? There aren't many so can they be fake reviews? Or is my family actually detached from what is considered a good Sci Fi movie nowadays.    

Everyone doesn't have the same taste. If everyone liked the exact same films, there wouldn't probably be many reviews in the world at all. 




 It was "announced"/teased a time ago, so I wasn't that surprised regarding it being properly announced today, heh. But the cover they have on the website actually looks horrible! 




 I agree with you. It looks like something you do in Photoshop in eight grade in half an hour! Heh. I hope they change it or something. They have some great covers, but this one was really disappointing, they can do better! 




 A bit underwhelming. I was expecting something "bigger" because of the Twitter page. Mulholland Dr. (2001) was already "announced"/teased some time ago, so that wasn't a surprise really. And if you ask me, that cover looks quite bad. Wasn't a big fan of Kwaidan (1964) or My Own Private Idaho (1991) when I saw them, so I'm not that excited for those two.  I haven't seen The Brood (1979) yet, but it looks a bit interesting, and I like some of Cronenberg's other films. I haven't seen A Special Day (1977) either, but I have a DVD of it, although I'm not that into Scola of what I have seen so far. Well, at least I'm saving some money. The Yoshida box set from Arrow is coming by the end of October, so I have that to be happy about instead! 




 It's already on the front page on "Coming Soon". 




 * **Ingmar Bergman's religious triptych:**  

Through a Glass Darkly (1961)  
Winter Light (1963)   
The Silence (1963)   

* **Michelangelo Antonioni's alienation trilogy:**  

Lavventura (1960)   
La notte (1961)   
Leclisse (1962)   

* **Yoshishige Yoshida's trilogy on Japanese radicalism:**    

Eros Plus Massacre (1969)   
Heroic Purgatory (1970)   
Coup D'Etat (1973)    




 Absolutely no idea. I'm hoping for A Brighter Summer Day (1991). Or something else interesting. Mulholland Dr. (2001) was already quite "announced"/teased, so that shouldn't hopefully be the "surprise". 




 Huh? 




 Speaking of Bulgarian movies, I've been meaning to watch The Peach Thief (1964) by Vulo Radev, I have to do that soon! 




 Here are my favourites from each of those years:   

**1975:** Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)    
**1976:** The Killing of a Chinese Bookie (1976)   
**1977:** Providence (1977)   
**1978:** Les rendez-vous d'Anna (1978)   
**1979:** Stalker (1979)     
**1980:** The Long Good Friday (1980)   
**1981:** Possession (1981)  
**1982:** Fitzcarraldo (1982)   
**1983:** L'argent (1983)  
**1984:** Paris, Texas (1984)  
**1985:** A Zed   Two Noughts	(1985)    
**1986:** Blue Velvet (1986)   
**1987:** Wings of Desire (1987)   
**1988:** Damnation (1988)   
**1989:** The Seventh Continent (1989)   
**1990:** Close-Up (1990)   
**1991:** A Brighter Summer Day (1991)   
**1992:** Kamen (1992)   
**1993:** Naked (1993)   
**1994:** Stntang (1994)     
**1995:** Dead Man (1995)   

Although I wouldn't really recommend getting drunk and watching them, but that's your call. I don't know if you are looking for something that's ideal to watch when you're drunk or just curious about other users favourites, it's a bit hard to point out exactly, I was just answering the question in the title. 




 [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eR6ZPZwEpU) scene from Winter Light (1963). 




 When Paul (played by Arno Frisch) uses a remote control in Funny Games (1997) to rewind the movie itself and change the consequences. One of the best moments ever when it comes to breaking the fourth wall. 




 I think Kurosawa has made several great films, I just don't feel that they're on the same level as my ten favourites. You also have to remember that it's only ten movies in that list, that's not so much. If I made a top 100 of the best Japanese movies of all time, I would probably include some Kurosawa. Other than that, I think you've pretty much answered your own question when you said that you haven't seen many older films that weren't directed by Kurosawa. You have so much to discover, I don't even know where to begin! For someone who has seen a fair amount of Japanese films, there's so many Japanese movies out there besides the ones made by Kurosawa. 




 **2006:** Lights in the Dusk (2006) *(Aki Kaurismki)*     
**2007:** My Winnipeg (2007) *(Guy Maddin)*   
**2008:** Night and Day (2008) *(Hong Sang-soo)*   
**2009:** The Limits of Control (2009) *(Jim Jarmusch)*    
**2010:** Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives (2010) *(Apichatpong Weerasethakul)*   
**2011:** The Turin Horse (2011) *(Bla Tarr)*   
**2012:** The Act of Killing (2012) *(Joshua Oppenheimer   Christine Cynn)*    
**2013:** Norte, the End of History (2013) *(Lav Diaz)*   
**2014:** Journey to the West (2014) *(Tsai Ming-liang)*   
**2015:** No No Sleep (2015) *(Tsai Ming-liang)*   
 




  Do you watch movies before your time? Or watch old black and white movies?   

Of course. Very, very often. I'm in my late twenties and I watch movies from the beginning of cinema to the newest ones today. There's not a single good reason to limit yourself to any years. If you're doing that, you're just limiting both interest, references and knowledge about movies overall. Some of the best movies I've seen are decades older than me. A movie's age is totally irrelevant for me, if something is good, it's good. I think it says quite much about you if you only have seen one black   white movie before the 70s. It's your own choice, but I don't even know where to start when it comes to what you are missing. But of course, maybe you just don't have a big interest in cinema? 




 Be sure to make him watch Norte, the End of History (2013) by Lav Diaz. 




 I vote for Michael Haneke. 




 Most bizarre news of the week! 




 You're quite wrong there. Great movie, but it definitely has a plot, a story where events relate to one another in patterns/sequences through causality. 




 * La chambre (1972)   
* My Name Is Oona (1969)  
* Process Red (1966)    














 I have no idea if you have seen it, but one of my favourite ones set in Los Angeles is Mulholland Dr. (2001). 




 Have you seen The Face of Another (1966), World on a Wire (1973) or Letters from a Dead Man (1986)? Those are my favourites if I don't count the obvious and well known ones like 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Stalker (1979) and Solaris (1972). 




 My top ten Japanese movies of all time:   

* The Face of Another (1966) *(Hiroshi Teshigahara)*    
* Eros Plus Massacre (1969) *(Yoshishige Yoshida)*   
* Woman in the Dunes (1964) *(Hiroshi Teshigahara)*  
* An Autumn Afternoon (1962) *(Yasujir Ozu)*   
* Late Spring (1949) *(Yasujir Ozu)*   
* This Transient Life (1970) *(Akio Jissoji)*  
* Silence Has No Wings (1966) *(Kazuo Kuroki)*   
* Double Suicide (1969) *(Masahiro Shinoda)*   
* Harakiri (1962) *(Masaki Kobayashi)*   
* Violated Angels (1967) *(Kji Wakamatsu)*    

Ten Japanese movies I've seen recently that were great:   

* Violence at High Noon (1966) *(Nagisa shima)*   
* A Wife Confesses (1961) *(Yasuz Masumura)*   
* The Munekata Sisters (1950) *(Yasujir Ozu)*   
* Five Women Around Utamaro (1946) *(Kenji Mizoguchi)*   
* Mother (1952) *(Mikio Naruse)*   
* Sword of Doom (1966) *(Kihachi Okamoto)*    
* The Emperor's Naked Army Marches On (1987) *(Kazuo Hara)*   
* Sound of the Mountain (1954) *(Mikio Naruse)*    
* Himiko (1974) *(Masahiro Shinoda)*   
* Confessions Among Actresses (1971) *(Yoshishige Yoshida)* 




 Some nice picks, especially Ozu, Naruse, Buuel, and Bresson. With that said, I really want to see Costa's new movie. 




 There's many examples. A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night (2014) that we already talked about is one. The River (1951) is another one, a film made by a French director that is based in India, shot in India, but has a lot of dialogue in English. Some of the cast are from India and some are from the Western part of the world. The countries IMDb lists are France, UK, India, and USA. All of these things doesn't really make it easier to categorize it by country, if you are going to do that. 




 Cra cuervos (1976) by Carlos Saura. 




 Oh. There's a ton of great ones.   

My personal top ten:   

* The Seventh Continent (1989)   
* Andrei Rublev (1966)   
* L'eclisse (1962)    
* Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)     
* The Face of Another (1966)    
* Eros Plus Massacre (1969)   
* Woman in the Dunes (1964)   
* Hiroshima mon amour (1959)   
* Winter Light (1963)  
* Stntang (1994)    

Ten foreign movies that aren't my top favourites, but are good and should be seen:  

* The Bicycle Thief (1948)   
* M (1931)  
* 8 (1963)  
* Rashmon (1950)  
* Metropolis (1927)   
* Battleship Potemkin (1925)   
* The 400 Blows (1959)   
* Seven Samurai (1954)   
* Breathless (1960)    
* The Seventh Seal (1959)   

I would suggest looking up the big list TSPDT has, you'll find many great and important foreign movies in it that should be seen. It will also get you introduced to directors like Ingmar Bergman, Andrei Tarkovsky, Yasujir Ozu, Fritz Lang, Akira Kurosawa, Franois Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, Federico Fellini, and the other big ones that one should know about. One suggestion could be to find the list on ICheckMovies and sort it by "in # official toplists", that way you'll see what foreign movies will be in the most lists, something that can be useful when you want to see the ones that are most popular, important and acclaimed. 




 Here are ten good ones:   

* A Brighter Summer Day (1991)   
* A Summer at Grandpa's (1984)  
* A Summer's Tale (1996)    
* Contempt (1963)   
* Do the Right Thing (1989)   
* Early Summer (1951)   
* Farewell to the Summer Light (1968)   
* Il sorpasso (1962)   
* The End of Summer (1961)   
* White Material (2009)    




 I would suggest starting with reading some of the reviews of it. There's a ton of reviews on Rotten Tomatoes and a ton of reviews on IMDb (both from the users and external reviews). There's also probably several analyses to find through Google on the movie as well. There's even several older discussion about the movie here too. I feel that it's very easy to find out why a big majority of people liked or didn't liked a movie.  




   I don't know if "Incendies" counts as a Middle East movie since some parts are set in Canada, but it is also awesome.   

I think it's a real stretch to call it that. It's a Canadian movie (and maybe a little French too because IMDb lists France as a country on the movie's page) by a French-Canadian director that was shot both in Canada and the Middle East. Certain parts of the film are supposed to be set in the Middle East (because the movie is based on certain events during the Lebanese civil war), but the director tried to make to make the location of the plot a bit ambiguous. So yeah, it wouldn't be quite right to call it a film from the Middle East. 




 I don't know. This is a quite small list though. I agree with you that it's a great movie, the whole Koker trilogy is really worth watching, especially considering the interesting meta perspective. Maybe most people rank Kiarostami's other films higher, I don't know. But I must say that Close-Up (1990) is my favourite by him so far. 




 What makes a film's nationality is a thing that always can be discussed, because there's always films that transcend it a bit and can be a bit harder to place in certain categories. So yeah, you have to have to look at the things you mention and see how it can be categorized from movie to movie. Where it is set and where it is shot shouldn't on the other hand have too much to do with it. For example, Schindler's List (1993) is an entirely American movie by and American director, even though it is set in Poland, which shouldn't make it Polish by any means.      

Speaking of A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night (2014), I still don't feel that it's a film that should be categorized as a film from the Middle East, even if it's of course "more Middle Eastern" than some other movies. It also feel like that the movie has been discussed on Reddit previously several times, so maybe it would be better to highlight some other films that are entirely from the Middle East that should deserve more attention instead. I understand how you were thinking at least. But yeah, it's a discussion that can be interesting in some ways. 




 A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night (2014) isn't really a film from the Middle East, I think it's a bit of a stretch to call it that. It's an American film in Persian that is supposed to be set in Iran that was filmed in Californa by an Iranian-American director that was born in England and spent most of her life living in the US.    

Besides that, it's nice to see Close-Up (1990) by Abbas Kiarostami on the list, it's a great movie. I'm actually waiting for the Criterion Blu-ray to be delivered to my mailbox. 




 You've got it all worked out for you, don't you? Good luck. 




 Now that is a boring poster, even if you are going to stick with the more minimalistic look, it looks like a tired job. And that "tagline" sounds like a big clich. I wonder if they payed someone to make this. There's thousands of people out there that make great posters who could do a much more interesting job. This is something you put together in Photoshop after a couple of minutes. The premise of the movie sounds interesting though, especially because it's about feminism, but I doubt that the movie will be even above mediocre, I really got that feeling confirmed after looking at the trailer. 




 A Man Escaped (1956) by Robert Bresson, the best one! 




 There was a discussion about the list in another subreddit recently, so I'll be repeating myself a bit. First of all, I don't think a list like that should be taken seriously. Not because of what movies are on it, but because every Tom, Dick and Harry can make an account and start rating movies, because some people only use 1 and 10 as ratings, because other people vote on movies they haven't watched, because people can use multiple accounts, because others try to vote up and down certain movies for stupid and irrelevant reasons, and that's just some of the problems with the list. Anyone can make an account and start rating movies on the site. There is no sincere seriousity and commitment behind the rating system, and that's because of the users. Another thing that's easy to notice, is that new and big movies tend to get heavily upvoted, especially just when they've premiered. People seem to go apeshit. So the list is based pretty much on popularity as well, we can see that on the required number of votes a movie must have to be able to be on the list too. Because of that, a movie that's a bit more obscure hasn't got a big chance of entering the list.    

Also, it feels a bit strange to compare what I think should and shouldn't belong on the list. The list is made by thousands of users, and I'm only one person. But if I made my own top 250 list, I would not include the majority of the films that are on the IMDb Top 250.   

I would put films like The Shawshank Redemption (1994), The Dark Knight (2008), The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003), Fight Club (1999), Forrest Gump (1994), Inception (2010), The Usual Suspects (1995), Interstellar (2014), Lon: The Professional (1994), Life Is Beautiful (1997), American History X (1998), Saving Private Ryan (1998), The Intouchables (2011), Whiplash (2014), Memento (2000), Gladiator (2000), Django Unchained (2012), Batman Begins (2005), and some others quite far from my own top 250. And that's just some examples. There's hundreds of movies I would "replace" them with if I made my own top 250. But as I said, it feels a bit strange to compare it this way. 




 Possession (1981). 




 A Man Escaped (1956) by Robert Bresson and Le trou (1960) by Jacques Becker, the two best ones of all time when it comes to prison escape movies. 




 Money. 




 What I think is that a list like that shouldn't be taken seriously. But that's because every Tom, Dick and Harry can make an account and start rating movies, because some people only use 1 and 10 as ratings, because other people vote on movies they haven't watched, because people can use multiple accounts, because others try to vote up and down certain movies for stupid and irrelevant reasons, and that's just some of the problems. Anyone can make an account and start rating movies on the site. There is no sincere seriousity and commitment behind the rating system, and the big problem about it are the users. And I'm not even commenting anything about taste so far. 




 I'm waiting for that Criterion Blu-ray of Hiroshima mon amour (1959) to be delivered to my mailbox. Feels great. 









 Sure, he's an actor in the film, so of course. OP didn't ask for movies with him as the lead character or something. 




 I disliked it because Scott seemed to have forgotten what makes good and effective science fiction, catching what's big in the little things. To make it simple, Prometheus (2012) was just generic, nobby, stupid, superficial, silly and tiresome. And talk about ruining all the mystique surrounding the "space jockey". 




 Apocalypse Now (1979). 














 Harakiri (1962) by Masaki Kobayashi does this as well. Such a good movie. 




 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) for me too. It looks amazing, diverse, has breathtaking cinematography and a great atmosphere. It also manages to cover a wide array of themes, such as man versus machine, the mysteries of the universe and the origins of humanity in interesting ways. One of the most important and best things about it is that the movie asks questions, and doesn't simply provide the answers for you, as well as being very open to interpretations. A milestone. 




 Rififi (1955), one of the best heist movies. 




 A Streetcar Named Desire (1951) and On the Waterfront (1954) are two classics. Apart from The Godfather (1972), Last Tango in Paris (1972), One-Eyed Jacks (1961) and Apocalypse Now (1979) would be considered important as well, even if I wasn't a big fan of One-Eyed Jacks (1961). 




 No, I haven't actually watched a single one yet! Too many movies to watch, to little time! I have to get started soon. 




 I did it. With the sale at Barnes   Noble going on, you probably won't find it in new condition to a much better price. It costs a bit more on Amazon US for the moment as well. If you're not satisfied, you could always sell it or trade it. It's a very nice looking set, both DVD and Blu-ray, which isn't bad at all. Also, if you're going to blind buy any set, this is the one, even Zatoichi is blind! 




 The Complete Kazuo Kuroki, where we get all of his films on Blu-ray and a lot of extra features. Gimme! 




 Pickpocket (1959) by Robert Bresson and The Man Who Sleeps (1974) by Bernard Queysanne. 




 It's a bit hard to find something that's really similar when it comes to the music, but you should anyways check out Odd Man Out (1947), Brighton Rock (1947) and Touch of Evil (1958), all those three have about the same atmosphere as The Third Man (1949). Carol Reed directed Odd Man Out (1947) about two years before he did The Third Man (1949) too. 









  This is a movie made when movies couldn't use special effects or CGI but instead had to rely on great story telling and great acting.   

I think you should read a bit about special effects, especially if you believe movies couldn't use them in the 70s. You have a lot of homework to do. 




 Double Suicide (1969) by Masahiro Shinoda. 




 * A Zed   Two Noughts (1985)   
* Contempt (1963)    
* Cries and Whispers (1972)   
* Happy Together (1997)   
* Pastoral: To Die in the Country (1974)

 You have some good stuff left to see there!     
Here's what I would pick for you from each row:    

* Double Indemnity (1944)

* Once Upon a Time in the West (1968)    
* Wings of Desire (1987)

* Ivan's Childhood (1962)  
* Wild Strawberries (1957)   
* Ordet (1955)   
* In the Mood for Love (2000)    




 Well, there's a lot I like that I didn't list, I only listed three movies from each decade, just like OP. It's quite hard narrowing down everything to such a small number!

I've seen Pickpocket (1997) already. I've seen Platform (2000) and Still Life (2006) as well, but I can't say I'm a big fan of Jia Zhangke so far. I'm still eager to see more by him though, maybe I'll like some of his other films better. 




 Heh, that's great to hear! Just ordered a Blu-ray copy of Close-Up (1990) from the Criterion sale Barnes   Noble is having, so I'm waiting for that one and two other titles to enter the mailbox. Feels nice. 




 Chelsea Girls (1966) by Paul Morrissey   Andy Warhol, the whole movies is presented in a split screen with a single audio track.
