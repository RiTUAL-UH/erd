 How about not safe for feelings?  




 Two portapotty's? I mean really? Is there some sort of BBC regulation that requires segregated bathrooms to be made available? 









 yes I did!

Now back now work for another 2 min. 









 I was thinking it would be fun to have back yard movie nights with my friends. I wanted to get an HD projector without going to crazy price wise (around $500). However when I started looking around I noticed projectors on places like ebay for 50-300 dollars that claim to be HD while other vendors charge 10 times as much. 

I was wondering what exactly the catch is. Why are they so cheap compared to proper projectors. Also any recommendations you guys have for projectors would be really appreciated.

Here is an example

 This post must be fairly new because I can see your awesome reply instead of 10 people bitching about their "asshole" parents and how they overcame it to become a top poster on /r/raisedbynarcissists. 

I miss my dad too. It never gets easier.
