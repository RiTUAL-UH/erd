 I think it was amazing, minus just a few tweaks. It was very moist while still holding a good shape. The only two things Id change were:

A.) add more lemon flavor than I did

B.) wait until the cake was completely cool to pour the frosting over so it didn't just roll down the sides. 


Overall, great cake and definitely worth a try.  The sweetness of the cake was a great offset to the tart blueberries! 




 Thanks for the tip! I'll try that next time.
