 Yes, Trump's not dangerous at all..... 




 Most of those defending Trump have to be paid sock puppets. Half of the people (or more) who showed up for his candidate announcement were paid to be there. It's highly likely he's paying people to leave comments too. 




 You have just made a friend for life. 









 I was referring to fighting in war, not starting them. 




 Um, maybe they are now. However, I'll take a douche who's served and bled for his country than a man who would bleed his country dry for himself. 




 But I've never heard Cheney, despite his faults, disparage POWs.

It's one thing to avoid war. It's another to avoid war and then insult those who served. 




 There's a difference between self-awareness and wisdom. Gaining one does not mean gaining the other.
