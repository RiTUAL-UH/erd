 Ohh thank you :) 














 Try making a new trade link and using that, worked for me! Hopefully you get your item :) 




 Did this right after i made this post, my old trade link was correct but when i made a new one it came instantly! 




 Help. Ive submitted a ticket and they haven't responded
