 It's a great idea, the guy I was paired up with does those tours exclusively.  I forget where we drove in from but it was far and he travels all over the country doing these tours.

The tour guide was great and I was pleasantly surprised at the spaces they allowed us into.

If you book for the next round of tours, let me know - I would do it again. 




 unfortunately I have not 














 Thank You!! 




 Thanks for that! 




 my pleasure, it was quite the undertaking and took two visits.  Still didn't get the whole place covered though. 




 lol 




 I can say that now since demo has started, yes 




 st thomas - its being prepped for demo 




 You would be right - taken a year ago 




 appreciate the comment 




 Thank You 




 Nope 




 Thanks 




 Awesome, thanks for sharing

 Thank You

 Thank You 




 I always look forward to the Fallout comments!! 




 For example - if I had not moved a mattress, this would not have happened

But hey - some guy on Reddit flags me as a fake, so I must be!

 




 That's great. .but i don't know how you can fake an abandoned pic. Often there is some very cool stuff hidden away in a drawer or in a bin...the only way to capture those items is to place them,
, Shoot them and then put them back. 




 Actually they were, I did not set this up.  Not to say someone else didn't set this up before me , but I shot it as I found it 




 I don't have any more shots as of yet - but I will, just haven't done anything with them online

 Thank you...and sorry :(

 Thank You 





























 thanks!!!! 




 oh brother, it was light out until 9:30 - yes it was night because it was after 6pm.  sheesh! 




 hahaha thanks! 




 I used to be, but not anymore.  I personally think that site is for lazy explorers, in addition to a number of other reasons I won't get into.

That is a great site for fresh new explorers who don't know where else to look and don't know any other explorers, but then there comes a point where you don't need to rely on a database and you build a network of friends.  I'll leave it at that. 




 it was probably a nice house before it became surrounded by the homes around it.  now it's just a mess amongst nice homes and properties.  also, all of the doors were coated with cobwebs so they had not been opened in a very long time. 




 There is a full site plan online, the house is being completely torn down to make way for a new home. 




 There was a sign on the front of the house from the city saying that this property is being rezoned for a multiple dwelling residence, so this house and contents are toast.

and, I am always trespassing! haha 




 you smart!!!!! 




 was being renovated and then left that way 




 was being renovated and then left that way 



















 I absolutely did, thanks for your concern for this! 



















 This is exactly as it was when I got there 




 But ya i know  




 People always ask me for more pics.

 Thanks!!!

 Thank you 




 Shoot me! 




 These are my favourite comments  




 I am posting one or two pics a day, i don't have time to edit all of them and i don't do batch processing, so i put out a couple at a time. Then when i have a full gallery i will make a page on my site with whatever history i can dig up.  Go to www.Facebook. com/train_subject246 and you can see what i have put up so far. 




 Thank you 




 Lolz 




 Thanks for noticing, I spend as little time as possible in post, some straightening, slight tweaks where needed until I'm happy with the end result. 




 Fuck - that would have been so awesome to check out. Thanks for the story.

Reminds me of this house:
http://www.freaktography.ca/abandoned-time-capsule/
 




 Thank You, that's a nice compliment from a "cranky photographer" 




 I know..........I know! 




 That is the hard part of what I do - it can be so hard to walk away from these things, but it's not mine to take - so I leave it. 




 Canada has some great squatting laws - it would not be difficult! 




 I have considered it but I spend long enough just taking photos of these places, I can't imagine spending more time shooting video as well.  I actually often think to shoot some video but then I get so excited taking photos that it never enters my mind to make video.

Maybe some day. 




 No No No, maybe I WANTED to take the typewriter, but I did NOT take the typewriter.  You must mean this one:

http://i0.wp.com/www.freaktography.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/DSC_0281s.jpg?resize=1024%2C683

I have very rarely ever had to use any type of force to enter an abandoned building maybe some gentle manipulation, but never damage or force.

Thanks for your comment 




 Thanks littleone66!
