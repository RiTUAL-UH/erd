 Baby steps. Sounds like you're doing things the healthiest way you can. Keep it that way. 




 Part of the problem here is that it sounds like you're attempting to gain muscle and lean out at the same time. While this isn't impossible, it can certainly be tricky.

I would recommend bulking and then cutting. That is, if you still feel the need to gain more muscle mass. If you're already satisfied with your muscle mass, bump up the cardio and limit your lifting to focus more on toning rather than growth. 

 is it more likely that I am just shit at counting calories?

Calorie consumption sounds okay, 1800-2100 is a good ballpark (don't know your stats). However the fact that you even have to ask yourself this question probably means you could be doing better at keeping track. Perhaps you already answered your own question!

Good Luck! 




 Ended football right before my senior season in high school. Had to help with bills anyways and work full time since my mom was out of work. The high school I went to practically breeds D1 recruits. When I think back, sure I would have loved to continue on and play in college, and it HURT LIKE HELL to have to give it up.

However, before I even graduated that year I already had a foot through the door in the finance industry, started expanding on my hobbies, and even leaned out and got signed with a top modeling agency.

All in all, the class before mine graduated 8 D1 recruits and things hardly worked out for any of them. I on the other hand had a great resume, academic scholarships, and multiple income sources. It was one of those changes that took some time to respect and truly appreciate. Never thought that dropping one major passion of mine would lead to me becoming a much happier and well-rounded individual.
