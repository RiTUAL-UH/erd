 Supporting Sanders? You'll never get downvoted  




 None of those countries are on the scale of the US  




 Thanks Obama  




 Alien blue  









 Give it 25 years and a decade of losing seasons... 




 Thats nothing  




 I was going to say something drastic, but I can't beat this. I already said I would give $500 to CSU if we make playoffs this year, I think that's enough for now  




 An employee sees an opportunity for more money and training, they should be able to do it. Companies want people who are willing to work the most. People who seek out these opportunities are the ones that do well in life.  




 Do you know if Wisconsin is one of them?

 Phones have recording capabilities 




 It's not an *easy* option  




 People who work harder get better things? Sounds reasonable. If your work becomes more hazardous because of others, then report it. All you have to do if have evidence of wrongful treatment/termination. There's nothing wrong with someone willing to work more getting more for it.  




 Not happy with your job? Get a new one.  




 He wants to replace it with something else that works better. But that doesn't fit with our fuck walker mindset  




 What an insightful comment, thank you for you contribution 




 Just like the trade agreement went through right when gay marriage was legalized.... 




 Just get written evidence. They emailed you asking to work 7 straight days? That's all you need.  




 Just look at edibles. Not OD but people don't feel the effect and take more, then get higher than planned  




 "If, however, employers tried to make that an overt requirement of employment, the workers could use that as a legal argument against the employer because that would clearly violate the voluntary nature of the action," 
Quoted from Witte,  professor emeritus of political science and public affairs at the University of Wisconsin-Madison 



















 "Mr. Walker would replace the board with something completely new that is truly accountable to the people of the state of Wisconsin, he told reporters after a bill-signing ceremony." 




 Jess you people are ridiculous, read the article before posting your top comment "fuck walker". 

Here you go "Ms. Patrick said the governor was willing to work with the State Legislature to find a replacement for the board in a way that is fair, transparent and accountable to Wisconsinites" 




 I attack from the east and west.  Just like Germany, Nebraska can't win on two fronts  




 Selective viewing by people here  




 I wouldn't be surprised if Colorado/CSU/Wyoming are  less than that  




 Fallout from not having a team in the championship  




 This better go full circle 




 Isn't Arizona still the flagship? There's way more than football that goes into being the flagship school. Money, research, academics, all play a bigger role  




 To Boulder, we renewed the series with opennings left by CSU not renewing  




 I just posted this, didn't see you already had. 
Related topic, I read somewhere that the east stadium would be getting new restrooms and concessions, know anything about that?  




 I'm pretty bored today if you couldn't tell, and Ryan /u/rkstarfox has been posting some good stuff on his Twitter. Is it September yet? 

 









 Would you be willing to come back in place of Air Force?  




 CSU didnt even go 1:1 in our worst decade in football, they'll never be flagship  




 Colorado in the playoffs. I will donate $500 to CSU if that happens this season 
Edit- maybe /u/csu_mike or other rams would like to get in on this 









 Ram Ale- the most sour beer on the earth.  




 I know the goal is to rent it out but having it as an alumi club or something every so often would bring in some money and be a cool asset  









 Hey! Oh, Clemson.... carry on

 As far as teams coming to Colorado:
Dread- Oregon and Arizona. Arizona has been worse than Oregon fans recently.
Enjoy- I guess Stanford, I haven't had any bad encounters with Stanford fans  




 Dumb and dumber too- Harry: "oh cool I got into Arizona State".

 Not everyone is cut out for college, there's a lot more than being smart that goes into it. He's pretty successful for not finishing school so he's doing something right  




 I know, I was trying to get the conversation going instead of waiting for a post like this  




 How about NCAA blitz 




 Settings- posts - show flair  




 I posted this here from the college basketball sub and was shut down for it not bring cfb related, it is and it isn't.  




 Play football this fall and send you film  




 Sefo had 500 something yards and 7 TDs against Cal last season, a school record. We still lost  




 If you haven't been in college for 4 years then theoretically yes  




 I think there's a lot of p5 teams missing  









 I see flair names on alien blue, do you want pictures instead? 




 Upcoming OOC games- Michigan, Nebraska, TCU, Texas A M. How is that not good?  




 Particularly Georgia  




 Colorado should be decent by 2017 




 5-8 is reasonable but I think we can break 6 wins  




 I was pleased with the reaction and actions taken. The administration was swift and appropriate. The team's protest was simple but got the point across.  









 We're not back  




 There were cringe worthy ads during the recall.  




 Good thing you don't need college to be successful or smart 




 Well 60% of the country doesn't even vote  




 Boulder is due for a riot  




 Narrow minded thinker right here. There's no correlation between the two here. Yet CU let's my sociology teacher come in fresh from smoking weed.  




 Have you taken sociology? There's definitely two sides to it.  




 It's in the name. Minimum pay for minimum living. Not happy with minimum wage? Get a better job.  




 At some point those conditions could kill in 24 hours. 

So if it's going to kill in 48, just wait another 24 




 I laughed at this too. Changing shit for up votes  




 Former Wisconsin resident here. Apparently abortion can only be associated with religion.  




 [Actually there is exception for immediate life threat to the mother] (http://www.thenewcivilrightsmovement.com/davidbadash/scott_walker_signs_anti_abortion_bill_with_no_exceptions_for_rape_incest_into_law) 




 Minimum wage isn't meant for a 2 bedroom.  




 Minimum wage isn't meant for a good life. It's for the minimum. That means no iPhone, or other luxuries. It's not for supporting a family. It's for one person, in a low end apartment.  




 That ended when we ditched big 12  




 Air Force, good thing that got renewed. 
Wyoming would be nice too 




 I know this was posted in the comments of the air force series being renewed, not sure if it's had its own post. Anyways, I know nothing about Texas state  but now the buffs will be playing 3 different Texas schools. (A M and TCU).  




 [Well...] (http://www.viralspell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/cg-2.jpg) 




 When did Clemson make a championship run?  




 Anyone that watched March madness knows this  




 Data required, my cap is too low 




 [It's not that subjective] (https://bouldercolorado.gov/newsroom/best-of-boulder-community-honors). 
The past decade was fallout of the sexual assault allegations, no names were ever named and nothing criminal ever became of it. The school cracked down on recruit visits so CU didn't get good recruits. The last AD didn't care about sports so he let everything get out dated. Then comes Rick George who makes it a priority. The future is bright for CU football. I could list a million changes and reasons but you've got your mind made up  




 Money isn't everything when you live in one of the best towns in the nation

 To Keep Open. Keeps blood from clotting in the catheter, as long as it drips, blood is moving  




 [Actually cops have no duty to protect someone] (http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/28/politics/justices-rule-police-do-not-have-a-constitutional-duty-to-protect-someone.html?_r=0) unless this has been overruled  




 Right, and it doubles as late night.  




 Good explanation, glad some police stepped up  




 If only we had a process in place where people could do this legally....oh wait we do  




 Legally speaking that is assaulting an officer  




 Legally it is attacking an officer 




 One of those people could beat the shit out of the other. Don't attack someone bigger than you.  




 Were they speeding or driving recklessly? If not then there's nothing illegal going on and you have to deal with her increased traffic.  




 They would want to get the knife away from him. If he won't out the knife down, they must do it themselves. Tazer could work but if ineffective then he slices his own throat of still has a knife. Try to take it with your bare hands and he will kill himself or turn the knife in officers. Shooting is the only sure way to get the knife away if he won't cooperate. 
If she didn't call the cops he still could've sliced his throat and no one would be there to stop bleeding which would only even be possible if it wasnt arterial bleeding. 
Calling the cops was the only real chance the guy had. She regrets it because she blames cops for the death. If he would've been cooperative or not suicidal then he would be alive. It's a coping mechanism of grief to blame someone other than the deceased.

 Colorado St and Wyoming
Colorado St and Air Force I think

 Completely serious here, have you considered a g5 sub for some things that get buried here but are enjoyed by g5 fans?  




 First Thursday of the season is Colorado at Hawaii, 1am ET/10pm PT start, can this be an official late night crew game thread?  




 And there goes his travel budget  




 I can't find a video on the field but there's a good one of [Coach  Mac] (http://gfycat.com/DeadlyFlakyHyracotherium). He's yelling to spike the ball, had we done so at the end of the first half against UCLA, we kick a field goal, no OT, Colorado upsets #25 UCLA at home for a conference win.  




 Mid range sec team  




 /r/surfing probably works  




 Hope was a pretty good strategy for Obama.  




 In terms of reddit, you're too late. He's already blown up.  




 [Have some of our rain] (http://www.bouldercast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wettestyears.png). That huge green spike is the boulder flood, years worth of rain over a couple days.  




 So Colorado? 
We give California enough water  




 Well, guess I need to make friends with the lab below  




 Someone was bit in golden a few days ago  




 Let's be real here. 38,000 




 In my system more than half of calls are run ALS because we run medic/EMT. Sure most of the calls could be done bls, but they step it up to ALS for some reason

 2-11. Losses to Hawaii and CSU, wins against Nichols St and UMASS  




 I've thought about watching a game from the physics building. The top floor is a conference room with [this view] (http://i.imgur.com/ZGUHOR5.jpg) 




 Does neutral site count? The CSU game is in Denver so almost 30 miles. The school buses the first ~500 students down, others take public transit, and others drive. Many upper classmen get hotel rooms for the night and just hit the bars after the game.  




 You forgot cheese curds  




 It's back

 It won't become common knowledge because reddit loves to fight the man  




 You've read correctly but reddit will still blame hospitals and doctors.  




 Replace hospitals with insurance  




 Healthcare is great, insurance and billing is messed up  




 Because insurance companies  




 Because there's no gasoline insurance that you intentionally charge a lot because you know they will only pay 10%  




 Sounds like hell for ALS trucks, moving around kind of unnecessarily  




 "Save my life" premiered tonight on ABC. Show follows some cases from ambulance to discharge. I haven't seen much Bullshit yet but I'm only 10min in  




 Care to elaborate? It just started here, mountain time. 
Does anyone know if Boston runs both bls and ALS trucks? They called out ambulance 15 and medic 1
