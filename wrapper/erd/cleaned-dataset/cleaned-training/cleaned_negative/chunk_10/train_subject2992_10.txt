 Film recently released called "It Follows". I'd recommend it. 









 Her influence and rule are two different things. She has direct physical rule over all of Slaver's Bay as of Season 5, that includes Astapor, Yunkai and Meereen. However her influence actually spreads further than that. There is a scene in the latest episode where a group of people pray for her in Volantis, which is much further west. It would be hard to calculate, however I'd say she actually has influence over a large portion of Essos. 




 She is a red head. Epsilon tracts talk about red heads
