 I'm sorry that I used the word eight and then numerals for 12. 









 My mom had this CD with a whole bunch of seemingly random songs on it that she would play for me when I was a baby. The first track was You've Got To Hide Your Love Away (Anthology version). 




 Let's make something wonderful of someone's life! 




 You guys aren't fu 




 What?  




 If you could add any feature to the next GoPro (Ignoring cost, plausibility or impracticality) what would it be? 




 Just for example, who would my second cousin's first cousin's husband's ex-father in law be in relation to me? 




 That's homophobic 




 C'mon Scoob, let's get out of here! 




 Don't forget Brian's winter! 




 It's still very much worth a watch,  even if you don't like jazz music 




 *I have no need for friendship, friendship causes pain* 




 This has to be my favorite movie quote of all time 




 I'm a dapper Dan man! 




 Does anyone know how these were done? 




 [Big Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZZp76M4NGc) by Fleetwood Mac. It's like a completely different song. 




 Get that corn outta ma face! 




 John: Oh My Love

Paul: Tomorrow

George: Awaiting On You All

Ringo: The No No Song 




 is this that whiplash movie everyone's talking about 




 Thanks  









 I haven't been this excited for DLC in forever!
