 He is saying that these more flippant responses dont really address his question, and may only have the appearance of profundity.  




 So if it is perpetrated by a military, it is not terror? 




 Around for what? 




 He overestimates the competence of *every* government.  




 What's the scientific consensus on it? 




 Hillary is a warmonger. 




 You don't have a mobile phone so you could check this at work? 




 That first paragraph nails it.  




 Yes, that hike cut short by a rage meltdown reminds me of many outings I had with my SO that were ruined for no reason. Painful times. I hope the damage isn't permanent.  




 No.  




 Alan Watts talks about Confucianism and Taoism here: http://youtu.be/Iv9zocKASsM 




 Excellent. Thanks!!! 




 I kid you not - just now someone came into the room and asked me: "What are you doing?"

Me: "Surfing the internet....literally."
 




 Can you give a nutshell version of Wittgenstein's take on Kierkegaard? 




 Horseshit. The banksters are the criminals. Debtors can and do sue lenders and third parties all the time. As signed contract doesnt absolve the parties of wrong doing, nor does it mean all future wrong doing is shared.  




 Right. I thought this person should be aware of both since he/she was asking about it.  




 I found that from chapter 8 on it was much easier - after the "inner chapters". Im reading the Penguin edition/translation.   




 It is another way of spelling Chuang Tzu. (For some reason, there is an aversion to acknowledging this here.) He is the other big Taoist author, along with Lao Tzu. "The Book of Chuang Tzu" along with the "Tao Te Ching" are the two primary Taoist texts, in very different styles that complement each other very well. The Penguin editions of both are superb.  




 Also known as Chuang Tzu.  




 Nothing is accurate when describing a person. No word or words or linguistic reduction of any kind is 1:1. Meyers-Briggs is a provisional convention, a tool, to communicate - not to be confused with people themselves.  




 It was because the monkey didnt even turn around to see where it went.  




 I see what you mean now.  




 Oppressed? Most of people on facebook have a rainbow profile picture. Gay people were dancing in their underwear on the street here two nights ago. Try again. 

And how and why are we all supposed to know another's sexual preference anyway? 




 Ha, as if i care what someone like you thinks.  So you call someone a fucking cunt because of a silly rainbow flag. What happened to all the tolerance?  




 Go call your wife's parents and see if theyll smoke some dope with you. Would be a better use of your time.  




 I'm not even going to read that.  Go get a life.  You have issues, you're ugly and angry and should be shunned.  I guess that's why you're here in the internet. 




 The authority of those getting married, manifest by getting married.  If they want to sign a legal contract, they can do that too. 




 Tell us what exactly about my comment had to do with *any* kind of ideology.  And try responding substantively to what I *actually* said.  
 




 No one said anything about the kindness of strangers, for one thing.  I wouldn't suggest the kindness of politicians is any better though.  It seems you're the one projecting and imagining things. Beyond that, I'm done talking to you.  Waste of time. 




 Your comment has zero substance, other than just plain dumbness.  




 Liberation? Ha ha. Not quite. 

Name calling over a flag? There's progress.  




 Because a person's sexual preference has nothing to do with me or anyone else, and because the government should have nothing to do with marriage of any kind. And because support for homosexuals need not be explicitly different from support of anyone else. And because the explicitness of it doesnt make any substantive difference.  




 Id much rather it was a rainbow flag.  




 Where, over the Bering Sea? 




 What deluded sanctimony! 

You always have been, and always will be free to pay *more* than you are charged. You can give as much money as you want to any downtrodden minimum wage employee you like, regardless of whether they were recently given a raise or prices were raised to account for it.  




 Shows you just how dumb the former is, and how it is good that everyone isnt that stupid.  




 Exactly. That's one basic reason these books just aren't that good. It was that way with Atlas Shrugged too, which people worship anyway.  




 Like the behavior of bears is consistent and predictable one moment to the next?  Watch 'Grizzly Man' and learn something.  




 Because it means debt slavery to entities that want to loot as much of their livihood as possible.  




 There are much better words for it than competitive. Truly competitive people are always extrovert, and of the choleric temperament, where it comes with jealousy and other things.  




 This is a piece of shit comment, buttercup. He was asking for help and advice. You framing this as "being negative" is disingenuous as best. 




 If you are highly competitive, you are not INTJ. 




 Pure evil, corrupt, wasteful, deceitful. Etc. They exist to take your money and energy.  




 TIL: This whole article is full of crap.  




 DJ doesnt owe us a thing. It is his life, he can go where he wants. He is from Texas. It isnt a huge surprise. 

I love the guy, but really dont like the liability that his FT shooting is, in the playoffs especially.

I wish him the best - except when he plays the Clippers.  









 This has to do with the Ni in us not seeing 'things' as thing per se. We don't see differentiation in objects of activities. 

Plus, we don't want to just take the world as it is, and live a mindless, soulless, ready-made life jusr because. 

Nonetheless, this does present practical difficulties. 

Edit: And we see ourselves as outside the world, reflecting on it instead of acting in it.  




 Ive been reading a lot of Taoism lately (Lao Tzu, Chuang Tzu, Alan Watts) and it is amazing how it counters, or preempts, about every one of these. 

I recommend it to everyone here! 




 My girlfriend diagnosed me with Asberger's too. :) 




 Im a licensed architect. I like architecture, but practicing it in the real world is a joke. 95% of what you do is not architecture. You don't get paid anything.  Real architecture is a profession to serve those who can pay gor it: the rich. I could go on. Let me know if you have any specific questions.  




 He is from Texas too.  




 Exactly what they needed!  A guy who can finish big games.  




 Exactly.  




 Thrre are always two sides to these contracts: debtors and creditors. For some reason, when they go south, many people only see the debtors as responsible. The creditors are just as responsible, if not more so, due to their fudiciary duties and supposed expertise - and due diligence as to where their money is going.  




 Not everything falls into the category of 'science'.  




 At was at a bar once, and Bruce Willis bought everyone there a drink. Generous guy.  




 Every high school student should have to watch this.  




 Yeah, throw out the "manipulation has happened before".  Certainly don't want anyone to tell you that.   




 What's beyond ignorant is implying that this sort of thing never happens, and faulting someone for suspecting it is.

Further, the fact that it has been reported elsewhere has *nothing* to do with whether or not this report is actually an attempt to influence the markets. 




 Well, generalizations are generally true. Have you ever been to a gay pride parade? You think most homosexuals would even deny they externalize? (How else would anyone even know theyre a homosexual?) Only when the wrong person makes the claim. 

You're trolling a subreddit you moderate.  Pretending to spot bigotry, or is it homophobia? Then delete comments that you dont like. I have friends who are gay, but they dont wear it on their sleeve. Whatever happened to tolerance?  Youre a confused hypocrite. And are actually counter productive to your cause.  




 You mean me saying that gay people externalize everything is bigotry? Can you tell me what exactly I said that was definitively bigoted? You're making general and elusive comments, that sound so serious and certain. Well, be specific. Only after I question your warning do you tell me a comment is removed? 




 What is it? Treading a thin line or bigotry? Warned for saying *what* exactly? 




 "Why would Belichick cheat?" 




 Evidently Pau told him about Kobe.  




 Besides, there already is a name for bigots. It's "bigot".   




 Yeah because for gay people their behavior is *everything*, especially identity. Whereas with anyone else, the behavior is distinct from who they are. Gay people for some reason have to externalize everything, even the most private.  




 And if you have no problem with gay people, but just think they need to get over themselves, stop making their behavior an identity, and stop putting their gayness in people's faces, you're still a homophobe. And that's not the definition of that word. But precision is not something that easily furthers the gay agenda.  




 What a load of delusional dishonest bullshit. I guess now Im a bigot and a homophobe.   




 Rubber bullets sounds like a gay sex toy. 




 "Enjoying sex" isn't what anyone is talking about.  Has anyone *ever* said there was shame in *enjoying* sex?  No. 




 Calm down, it's just the new Homeland Security terror alert system. 




 "Often cited" by people who wish it to be true by virtue of repeating it, a common practice here on reddit.  But this has nothing necessarily to do with actual reality.  Though it isn't hard to believe that it sometimes occurs, study or not.

Another theory that isn't new is that some gay people wish to stigmatize those who don't like their behavior.  So they call anyone who doesn't support in-your-face flamboyance, for example, a homophobe, as if that is a scientifically established category - because it sounds like it might be.  Actually, *homo* means "the same" and *phobia* means "fear of":  Fear of the same.  This is the furthest thing from scientific rigorous thinking, which is supposed to be cool on reddit.
 




 Good enough for reddit though.  You know, "because science".
 




 Yeah, everyone already knows it.  Just like everyone knows that if you are racist, you're just reacting to a deep internal fear that you might actually be black, for example. 




 Was going to recommend Camus. 




 Right, but no one here is talking about any plan, just dogs.  









 Dogs = detailed plan ?

Shhhhh, be bery bery quiet.  I hunting wabbit. 




 This was obviously edited. 




 Banksters use the same tricks to get around every law that is so zealously thrown at them. 




 How about post the sign *before* the bridge, not *on* the bridge.  Doesn't matter how big it is, or if there already are two signs there, or a hundred signs there. 




 The "chatter"  is 50:1 in favor of gay marriage.  









 Exactly. I heard they were using those. But where are they? 




 I literaly just read that today. And Chuang Tzu was bashing a battered tub and singing.  




 Ok but how do you know, if it hasn't been reported?  I haven't seen any dogs on TV.  




 Can someone tell me why they aren't tracking this guy, David Sweat, with a team of hound dogs.

They know where they saw him last, literally just over an hour ago, as I type this.  It seems they could put some dogs on that trail and have him captured immanently.  Why not? 




 it's ok.  forgive me for being harsh.  it is just that with this subreddit, 9 out of 10 comments are, to paraphrase: "words don't matter, it is all about what *is*.  so if you stop using words, your question will magically disappear."  but the TTC states explicitly that the Tao has an essence which can be tested.  the TTC itself, in fact, uses words.  i would say that these commenters are immature in their experience of Taoism, and happen not to add to the value of the subreddit. 




 You are using a lot of words to say that words don't matter much.  *I understand the the Tao is the way, things just are, words are convention, etc, etc, etc.*  The TTC and Chuang Tzu talk about all sort of things, directly and indirectly, but they never mention marriage or human family relations even in passing.  If your "explanations" held up, there would be *no* talk of any relationships of *any* type in these books, but instead, there is much talk of them; a ruler's relationship to the citizenry, for one.  Your adherence to supposed principle is keeping you from seeing what is right in front of you.  Not very Taoist. 




 No, he's agreeing with me.   




 Misleading title. 




 Not sure what you mean. Are you saying that talk of relationships assumes that things can go bad? 




 Immaculate is a good word to use, and I won't argue with his potential. But he needs at least a bit of fire in his eyes.  




 So it is either/or, feel or theorize?  Do you feel your relationship with your parents?  The Tao Te Ching and Book of Chuang Tzu talk about the relationships of other things, but human relationships are off limits? 




 In several plays in the Final Four, I saw him make some really half-hearted effort.  He appeared to not *really* be trying, looked unmotivated.  They were plays that just a little more effort would have resulted in a score, but didn't.  This isn't good to see in a game of that importance for someone with his potential.  They are things one *never* sees in a star, and never wants to see in a potential draft pick.  I understand it is a small sample size, but if I were a GM that would still bother me.  Also, Skip Bayless later tweeted about seeing the same thing which tells me I wasn't imagining it. 




 But it doesn't refer to relationships in that sense either.  Whereas regarding some things, it does say X is something to avoid, is not the way of the sage, etc.  

Nor does it refer to physical/sexual relationships like man-woman, procreation, etc, or even that of animals. 




 I don't know, but when I smoke cigars, I get the urge to call people (to talk). 




 They say that was Watts' best book.  'Cannery Row' and 'Of Mice and Men' were also very Taoist. 









 Yeah, I would've probably taken him above Okafor.  I think Okafor was over-rated and Winslow probably under-rated.  Miami got a steal. 









 You should post the letter. 




 18 million government workers?  That's about 1 out of every 17.7 Americans.  What a waste. 




 Go after *real* racism because you really want to stop racism.  Not symbols just because you want to appear to be doing the right thing.  (By "you", I mean everyone.) 




 What these people are talking about is this:  The more hypocritical politically correct things are done in the name of fighting racism (but actually don't do a goddamn thing because they are only meant for politics and headlines and *appearing* to care), the more real racism is allowed to perpetuate.  Apple is OK with people killing each other, and worse, in video games, but they suddenly have a problem with the Confederate flag?  If that's the best we can do to fight "racism", then there is never *not* going to be racism.  Stop protecting the counter-productive hypocrites. 




 The parties contradict each other; if not in practice, at least in their rhetoric.  Your comment contradicts itself.  The media follow their own corrupt corporate interests.   




 He is one of those players who doesn't pass the ball.  Most stars will not want to play with a guy like that.  Phil should trade him to a dumber team and rebuild. 




 I hope Uber destroys these taxis, their unions, and their protectors in the government. 



















 You absolutely should read Alan Watts' "The Watercourse Way".

John Steinbeck's novels are very Taoist. I recommend "Of Mice and Men".

And you should read the "Book of Chuang Tzu".  I suggest the Penguin version.  




 I would second the taking of Hoff with a grain of salt.  




 This reminds me of a boss I used to have. Secrecy was the handmaiden of his incompetence.  




 He's always posing. 




 Who is the blond? 




 Thanks for clarifying that.  Yes, I pretty much agree with your assessment of why he brings up the 5 colors/organs/sounds, etc.  Though to me it seems like he's not throwing the 5 elements/phases in with all the other groups of five.  He doesn't give them the same treatment.  The 5 elements/phases are left out of those discussions.  I was wondering if I was reading this correctly, and if there was a reason they weren't given the same treatment as the other groups of 5. 




 Thanks.   




 I did cite the passages, but perhaps you're asking if I can quote them.  Here is Burton Watson's translation:

***
FROM CHAPTER 14:
The shaman Hsien beckoned and said, "Come - I will tell you. Heaven has the six directions and the **five constants**. When emperors and kings go along with these, there is good order; when they move contrary to these, there is disaster. With the instructions of the Nine Lo, order can be made to reign and virtue completed. The ruler will shine mirror-like over the earth below, and the world will bear him up. He may be called an August One on high."

FROM CHAPTER 12:
The hundred-year-old tree is hacked up to make bowls for the sacrificial wine, blue and yellow, with patterns on them, and the chips are thrown into the ditch. Compare the sacrificial bowls with the chips in the ditch and you will find them far apart in beauty and ugliness; yet they are alike in having lost their inborn nature. Robber Chih, Tseng, and Shih are far apart in deeds and righteousness, and yet they are the same in having lost their inborn nature. There are **five conditions** under which the inborn nature is lost. One: when the **five colors** confuse the eye and cause the eyesight to be unclear. Two: when the **five notes** confuse the ear and cause the hearing to be unclear. Three: when the **five odors** stimulate the nose and produce weariness and congestion in the forehead. Four: when the **five flavors** dull the mouth, causing the sense of taste to be impaired and lifeless. Five: when likes and dislikes unsettle the mind and cause the inborn nature to become volatile and flighty. These five are all a danger to life. And yet the followers of Yang Tzu and Mo Tzu go striding around, thinking they have really gotten hold of something. This is not what I call getting hold of something.

If what you have gotten has gotten you into trouble, then can you really be said to have gotten something? If so, then the pigeons and doves in their cage have also gotten hold of something. With likes and dislikes, sounds and colors you cripple what is on the inside; with leather caps and snipe-feathered bonnets, batons stuck in belts and sashes trailing, you cramp what is on the outside. The inside hemmed in by pickets and pegs, the outside heaped with wraps and swathes, and still you stand in this tangle of wraps and swathes and declare that you have gotten hold of something? If so, then the condemned men with their chained wrists and manacled fingers, the tiger and the leopard in their pens and prisons have also gotten hold of something! 
***

I looked up Wu Hsing [here](http://www.philtar.ac.uk/encyclopedia/taoism/yinyang.html) and [here](http://www.iep.utm.edu/wuxing/), and it is clear that the 5 colors, sounds, organs, etc., derive from the 5 elemental phases (constants).  I understand Chuang Tzu's method of exaggeration and humor, but that doesn't mean that the book can be reduced to a one-liner which shall not be discussed, or that everything that isn't clear can passed over as a joke.  The TTC states that the Tao has an essence that can be tested.  Asking a question for clarification is hardly "overthinking".

 




 Just wait til Kobe hears about this. 




 Excellent.  Thanks. 




 Do you know how Kaufmann's would compare to Safranski's? 




 Do you know how Kaufmann's would compare to Safranski's? 




 Do you know how Kaufmann's would compare to Safranski's? 




 In Chapter 14 of Chuang Tzu, in the first real paragraph, it mentions the 5 cardinal elements (fire, wood, earth, metal, water).  These are also known as Wu Hsing.  Elsewhere in the Chuang Tzu, the 5 colors and the 5 smells, etc., are mentioned, as in the last paragraph of Chapter 12.

It seems to mention the 5 colors, in particular, as something to avoid.  That is, the names and limits of 5 colors trap our minds into assuming there *are* only 5 colors.  But does Taoism similarly suggest avoiding the 5 elements, for the same reasons?  Or is there a difference in how the Tao approaches the 5 elements vs. the 5 colors?  Am I wrong to assume there is any similarity in the treatment by Taoism of the 5 colors and the 5 elements?

Any clarification or explanation you can provide would be most helpful.  Thanks. 




 yeah, i was also wondering about safranski.   




 I just got the Walter Kaufmann bio yesterday. Will read it after Ray Monk's bio on Wittgenstein. Both Nietzsche and Wittgenstein were pure INTJs.  




 we lead mostly by competence, not by authority or vision or force. also, treat others with respect and like they should respect you, and dont antagonize.  




 I never said anybody said that.  




 It almost sounds like you're serious.  




 Go to work?  I was hoping you wouldn't say that. 









 Yeah, aren't wealthy parents terrible? 




 They bribed the reporters not to mention it. 




 That's what I was thinking. Thanks! 




 Leaning toward getting the Walter Kaufmann one, but what do you think?  Thanks. 




 You can still vote and join the military at 18 though.  




 ok. fair enough.  




 So the consensus percentage was off by 2%.  Is the temperature prediction more accurate than that? 




 but he says it when hes sober too.  




 If they simply enforced laws against fraud and breach of contract and theft, and didn't bail these guys out....We should start there.  More laws are meaningless, when we don't enforce those we have. 




 I'm with you on some of that.  But we don't even really have a democracy today.  Maybe it's the best type of government there is, but we don't even really have a true democracy these days.  Besides, we're supposed to be a republic.  I just tend to be against those in power, no matter who they are, because they're always corrupt, etc.  And they tend to hide behind a false democracy.  For instance, almost no one is for the TPP, but they're ramming it down our throats anyway.   




 I appreciate your work and that you're not taking a politician's word for it.  But my spreadsheet could (would) have errors as well.  

This is what Hayek called "the pretense of knowledge". 




 That's not an argument so much as gangster racket.  Also, it could be just as well argued the other way:  The money the "unsuccessful" *don't* make should be paid to them by society because the society contributed to their lack of success.  Who says what is successful?  What about the success we never see?  In short, compared to what?  Check out Fredric Bastiat's "The Seen and the Unseen".  There is a free pdf online somewhere. 




 I'm all for challenging force of whatever type, whether it is corporations, governments, anything.  Democracy is just herd mentality though, and rule by majority.  Nothing inherently good or just about that, just that when it comes to the (unually inevitable) conflict, they already have a majority in support of it.  I say, if the majority wants something, they should do it themselves as individuals, because they believe it should be done - instead of waiting for it to come up on the ballot and vote for it.

But back to my other comment:  Free markets, per se, don't lead to abuses and corruption, like we've seen on Wall St. recently.  The banksters make the laws and are enabled by DC to do these things.  DC and Wall St, the government and the banksters/corporations, work hand in hand to screw us all.  Enforce the law, enforce contracts, punish crime and criminals, for a start.  




 So....other than this there are no glaring errors in your work?  We can trust that it is 100% correct, right? 




 Right.  But one side wants to use force to take money.  The other wants to let people keep what is theirs, and says coercion is wrong, illegal, a problem, counter-productive, etc.  The former says they don't care who disagrees with them, it is imperative to take money from people.  The latter says lets agree to disagree, disagreement is to be expected (and probably valued), just don't hurt me or take my stuff.

EDIT:  I'm not suggesting you're saying otherwise, just adding to what you wrote. 




 Are these the same forecasters who were wrong about the costs of Obamacare in the first place? 




 Bill O'Reilly should be the next to go - for his documented and proven lies in the JFK book.

Edit: Look [here](http://jfkfacts.org/?s=bill+o%27reilly) before you downvote and run. 




 Oh fuck you.  No one is talking about a "presumption of innocence".  I'm talking about simply being able to fire someone, cops in this case.  Anyone in most non-government jobs can be fired, sometimes for inconsequential things.  People have recourse in courts if they want to pursue it.  People get fired all the time without their "lives being damaged".  Cops do things all the time that warrant firing, but they don't get fired because they have these protections.  Respond with substance or shut the fuck up and go away.   




 Because the cops know they get paid time off for bad behavior. This, if not incentivizing bad behavior, doesn't discourage it.  




 You keep bringing it back to guilt or not guilt as determined by a court. Courts don't always get it right, especially when it comes to cops. No other line of work has these protections.  If you think they are so necessary, advocate that ALL professions implement them.  




 It doesnt protect the public.

So police shouldnt be fired for anything unless/until found guilty in a court of law? What a load of horseshit.  




 You're not reading very carefully.  What a waste of time.

Watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6yaeD-E_MY) and tell us you're not sure if the murder was justified.  

Why should police be protected any more than any other line of work?  If your boss thinks you did something stupid at work, he can fire you, without giving you paid leave until further investigation is complete.  You can pursue it in court if you want.  Cops can pursue it in court if they think they were wrongfully terminated too.  Plus, there is a difference between not following police procedure, police abuse, killing someone, all kinds of gradients.  They could be fired for not following procedure and the court could still find them innocent.  You are saying that cops should be paid unless and until the court finds them guilty.  Why the fuck is that?  







 




 Paid leave could be said to be corruption itself.  Plus, there is corruption and cover-up all over the place in these police departments anyway.  Further, it's not obvious how it would deter corruption.  

[Look at this](http://transparentcalifornia.com/salaries/search/?q=police) if you think police don't get paid that much.

What if they did something heinous, but the court found them not guilty?  OJ Simpson style?  Still give them paid leave and let them keep their jobs?

Watch the Kelly Thomas [murder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6yaeD-E_MY) and tell us you aren't sure whether the cops should be fired. 




 Of course not.  What's stupid is thinking I'm saying any such thing.  

But should a police department *not* fire an officer for proven abuses?  The extreme, but all too common, example is when police have video evidence of officers killing a guy for no reason.  These guys should be fired, period.  Whatever the court determines is another matter.   




 You just need to look for yourself to see the original context. Should I have quoted it whole? If I had it wouldnt have made the least bit of difference. Try again.  




 "Comes to light" usually means when then public finds out about it, even though fellow officers already knew.  

And the problem is that these officers are put on *PAID* administrative leave until the procedures run their course.  They should be able to be fired on the spot, and certainly not be *rewarded* with paid time off.  Police unions are the big cause of much of the police abuse problems today.  They defend and protect and enable it.  Cops should have to pay their own legal fees like anybody else.  The unions don't want any accountability.   




 I was just going to say:  Loyalty to a fellow frat boy trumps all for these goons. 




 Except we dont have control issues.  




 So making billions and billions is bad?
