 Haha, that's a pretty funny line actually.  




 That's cool, I love seeing old universities like this.  




 Man, with the boots, coat, and googles he's pretty smooth looking. Love old pilot gear. 




 I love Elena as a character.  Glad to see others do too :) 




 nyuk nyuk nyuk 




 God damn that's sad. I enjoyed the comic and she kept posting right up until the end. So young too. Fuck cancer... 









 100% agree 




 Nail bat. Seems like the kind of thing I would realistically be able to get my hands on. 




 Wow, a pedophile and a traitor. What an absolute piece of shit.  




 That must be why their rank turns back to gold like a butterbar... 




 Mazel tov!  




 Congrats on both the run and the green card!! 




 Sushi, J-pop, and anime/Manga all spread worldwide without government help. They should just let culture take its course. 




 Exploration. I think FFVII had some of the best cities and locations in video games. I'd love to explore a huge Midgar, both above the plate and under it. Or run through the whole casino world of the Gold Saucer including tons of games and new areas. 




 Not with VAW, but does it look like the top one [here?](http://www.markstyling.com/e2c1.htm) You can click to zoom in on it.  




 [Salus populi suprema lex esto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salus_populi_suprema_lex_esto) (The health of the people should be the supreme law)

Even the Ancient Romans knew that public health and safety was a primary role of the government.  




 Haha, so true 




 Living in Minnesota I bump into a fair amount of Canadians, and all of them have been great people. Happy Canada Day!  




 Also the mascot of MIT and CalTech since they are the "engineers" of the animal world.  




 Can a sub reactor really go to 105%?  




 FFVII was all about the story to me. Yeah I'd love to have the original combat system (with the option to switch between ATB and turn-based) but at the end of the day I'm sure I'll love it as long as they get the story right.  




 Oh God the roast beef...so good... 




 I love this line 

From [this article:](http://sports.yahoo.com/news/u-s--reaches-women-s-world-cup-semifinals-with-1-0-win-over-china-014630725.html)

Carli Lloyd posed for her Player of the Match photos, beamed into the bright lights and then was asked the difference between Friday night's game and all the others so far.

"Freedom," she said. 




 Woo rainbow! Twin Cities Pride festival is this weekend, and I'm guessing it is going to be awesome :) 




 [Supreme Court Rules In Favor Of Most Buck-Wild Pride Parade Nations Ever Seen](http://www.theonion.com/article/supreme-court-rules-favor-most-buck-wild-pride-par-50768) 




 To be honest, these rulings might be good for the GOP candidates. If Obamacare was repealed, they would be in the hotseat to come up with a functional replacement. And now that gay marriage is "settled", they won't have to oppose it at every campaign stop during the primary and look wildly out of step with national public opinion during the general. 
 




 In my head it was like [this](http://imgur.com/gallery/CtxLIG8) 




 I think the U.S. has had Marines stationed in Georgia for some time to help prepare for [Afghanistan.](https://www.dvidshub.net/news/164650/us-marines-aid-infants-georgia#.VY0rLFVVh0Y)

Of course with Russia acting up, it doesn't hurt to have them there for that too.  




 You should just copy [The Rock's cheat day.](http://imgur.com/r/wtf/2fxYx) 




 Five-foot-nine, I didn't know they stacked shit that high! 




 I know the advertising (and my recruiter) say the reserves is "one weekend a month, two weeks a year", but how true is this? I've heard stories of longer/extra drill periods that come up. I'm more than happy to work extra when needed, but I live a few hours from the closest NOSC so I just wanted to get an idea. 

Also would officers be expected to work more hours/drills than enlisted?

Thanks! 




 30 and just had a kid! Guess I'll have to introduce her to the greatest game ever made... 




 Agreed. I've been saying "I will buy whatever system the FF7 remake is on" for years...guess I'd better start saving.  




 Damn, those countries above 10%...hard to imagine 1 out of every 10 people in your country being killed in just a few years.  




 [This was a pretty good write up of the weapons being used.](http://armamentresearch.com/Uploads/Research%20Report%20No.%203%20-%20Raising%20Red%20Flags.pdf) 




 Exactly. I think this is less of a problem with the UN as an organization, and more a problem with the individual countries that make up the peacekeeping force in Haiti.  




 That is so awesome to read. Really shows how important persistence is. And just think, if you got accepted the first time around, you probably wouldn't have met your wife...  




 That's really interesting,  thanks for posting. 




 So easy a caveman could do it... 




 Pepsi Seiko, check. Kershaw knife, check. Navy-related lighter, check....I think I just found my dream EDC! 




 Let's not forget the best acronym of all: [The USA PATRIOT Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act)

Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism  




 That's awesome! Reminds me of the exercise room on Cowboy Bebop.

 10,000 F-22s? Oy vey... 




 I bet I can guess which guy failed... 




 These sound useful, unless the targets are ray-shielded, and then they would have to use proton torpedoes... 




 As a parent of a 1 month old, I miss sleep :(  




 Haha my first thought too!  




 That's awesome and terrifying  




 Wait when they say he "hand carried ammunition", does that mean he actually just scooped them up in his arms and walked around on two legs?  




 Totally agree here. I pick up a huge bag of rice at the Korean market for way less than smaller boxes at a normal grocery store.  




 Right, exactly. She is in fact mixed race and she's just as much white as she is Asian, so there's nothing inaccurate about it.  




 I'm white and my wife is Asian. When talking to people about college applications, every one said our daughter should check the "mixed race" or "white" box, not "Asian" just so they'll have an equal shot...pretty sad.  




 How long did it take? 




 Coming up next on Sick Sad World... 




 Could it handle old PC games off of Steam? I'm thinking like Age of Empire 1, Starcraft, SNES-emulator type games.  




 I had the exact same thing when I bought the Persona 3 box there. They had tightened it so hard that it dug into the front of the hardcover art book that was included. Was that really necessary?  









 Good for keeping out Genghis Khan's submarines 









 Perhaps you should check out the [French Navy](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Matelot.jpg) 




 No bear spray? 




 Mega Man 3 for sure. I don't know why but I can listen to that for hours...I even made a CD when I was younger of just that them playing over and over.  




 There was actually a joke blog like this (that I can't find now) that was called something like "I hate Peter Hessler" because every time the author would try to tell his friends some cool story or insight about China they would all say "Oh yeah Peter Hessler talks about that in his book..."  




 Anyone know of a place to get a baseball cap? I've looked everywhere for one, but haven't had any luck so far... 




 Not sure what I love more...the contents or the organization :)  




 I'm sure it's been posted before but [Ben Franklin's daily schedule](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/04/picture-of-the-day-benjamin-franklins-daily-schedule/237615/) had some good points. My favorite is the question he asks himself every morning: What good shall I do this day?  




 I have one in the center console, that way both the driver and passenger can reach it. I originally had it in the door compartment, but I figured if I got T-boned it would probably get damaged or knocked out of reach when I needed it.   




 That was a good read, thanks for posting.  




 Who's the more foolish, the fool or the fool who follows him? 




 Wow nice job! That's a tough process to get through. 




 How has the funding situation been for your organization?  




 It's like the Shagohod... 




 Who is allowed to the computer? Is it a first-come first-served thing, or do organizations pay money to rent time on it?
