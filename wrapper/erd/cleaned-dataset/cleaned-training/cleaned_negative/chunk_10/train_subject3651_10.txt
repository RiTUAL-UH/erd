 One interesting possibility is that trans teens will be less depressed if they know it's not a case of being in the "wrong body". From the conclusion:
Transgender youth are aware of the incongruence between their internal gender identity and their assigned sex at early ages.

 that is an incredibly interesting insight into a blessing that always bothered me a bit. Nice. 




 Incidentally, all of those Talmudic cases also have very practical, law-based applications. For instance, the section on breast size is trying to determine at what age a woman is considered an adult for the purpose of court prosecution, especially in capital cases. 

In the US, once you're 18 you are an adultregardless of your personal development. Even though we know some 15 year olds can consent to sex and make their own decisions, we call them children. And even though we know some 20 year olds can barely consent and are easily swayed by peer-pressure, we consider them adults. 

The Talmud tries to avoid these pitfalls by defining adulthood for the purposes of consent and prosecution by physical development...the onset of puberty...at which point, the Talmud needs to define puberty.

Fascinating...not ridiculous. 









 If you've ever met someone with colorectal cancer or Crohn's Disease, this actually makes a lot of sense. I think it's sort of awesome that they thank god for something that actually matters...the physiological processes that make our bodies work. Sure beats those hymns thanking god for mountains and forgiveness and stuff. 














 nah, that was me. sorry.
