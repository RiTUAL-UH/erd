 I personally have never viewed any content form any of these channels. Il definitely check these out. Thanks for the recommendation  




 Cool, Il make sure to check them out. Thanks for the recommendation bud 




 Not a big fan of that guy. But I get the appeal.
Just the name of his channel makes me think that he goes into movies looking for the bad, instead of going to have a god time 




 Toy Story 3. The ending got to me, was not prepared 
 




 SkyFall.  




 Gone Girl.........plz no .......plz 




 I also am a fan of Jeremy Jhans. He is by far the best one to go to if your expecting a quick and entertaining review.
