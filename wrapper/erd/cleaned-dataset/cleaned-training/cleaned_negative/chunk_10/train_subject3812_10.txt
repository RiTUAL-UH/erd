 In English law a person:
(a) intentionally penetrates the vagina, anus or mouth of another person with his penis,
(b) that person does not consentu to the penetration, and
(c) he does not reasonably believe that they have given consent.

Women can not rape as they don't have a penis but they can be done for sexual assault .
