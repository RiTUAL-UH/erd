 Thanks! Don't worry though - I'm totally with everyone on the annoying mouth sounds.  




 There's certainly a logic to that, and it sounds like JJ's actual reasoning too (I quote him from the Star Trek director's commentary on this in the video). 

The danger that comes with filming it like this, is that you're going against a century of 'action' filmmaking - a cinema language that's developed with and for the audiences ability to read the onscreen action. Going off that path could be more likely to frustrate the audience by making it harder to watch then the more traditional approach.

As for gritty action films - MI3 is about as gritty as he's gotten and he did seem to do well with the action in that. 




 Yeah I actually have a bone disorder that has altered the bones in my skull, making them encroach on my nasal passage and vision. There's not that much I can do about the nasalness or the pitch, and little I can do about the mumbling. It's complicated is what Im saying.
