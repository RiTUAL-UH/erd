 I really liked it. The reception's been pretty mixed on Rotten Tomatoes so far, and most of it has been because of how predictable it can be at times. 

Honestly, I didn't really care if the movie didn't break any new ground for the boxing/redemption genre. It was engaging, shot beautifully, and the actors were phenomenal (cue Eminem) in their roles. Oona Laurence did exceptionally well as the daughter. 

Bottom line - great film to check out if you're into fight films. And arguably even better if you're not too familiar with the genre just because of how accessible this one felt. 

I'll be here to answer any questions you guys have on the movie!

Synopsis: As the boxing industry begins seeing a decline in ratings after the fight between Pacquiao and Mayweather, executives begin engineering a genetically modified hybrid boxer to attract viewers. But when things make a turn for the worse after the new experiment goes on a rampage, it's up to pro boxer Billy Hope (Jake Gyllenhaal) and his raptor hype crew to rescue the industry from certain extinction.  




 We get the force we deserve 




 **MY WIFE DIED HERE** 




 **THEN YOU ARE LOST** 




 Depends... 




 Funnily enough, that's exactly what I had it renamed as on my Facebook page. 

'Kings   Queens' was a favorite of mine by 30 Seconds to Mars back in the day.  




 Sakura Micron Pens. Hands down. They're what I used. Get the 8 pen pack off of Amazon! 




 Absolutely. If you guys want them! 

It's going to take a bit of time - I'm still touching these up and finishing more as part of a set. 




 I'm working on Blue right now! 




 So the "Kings" was in reference to them being the two rexes ("rex" meaning "king" in Latin) on the island.. and I was an idiot for not realizing how that'd conflict with the queen thing before I hit submit with that title.


I'm probably pulling a Kanye and changing the title when I think of something new because now it's bothering me too. Thank you, by the way! 




 I am - I put my name and website up on the side of the artwork (hopefully it's not too obnoxiously placed).

Thank you, by the way! 









 Haha I was going off the "rex" (king) in both their names! Believe me, I still had a hard time choosing between that and "Queens".

EDIT: Okay, I'm starting to regret the title. I'm going to pull a Kanye here and change it. 

..Whenever I think of a good one.

 









 I don't know this.  




 This clears up Trent Reznor's win for me. I was beyond excited when *The Social Network*'s score got the Oscar, but at the same time surprised considering Trent utilized two tracks from his Ghosts I-IV recordings for Nine Inch Nails. 

 




 The "official" reason for the I-Rex is to introduce something new and unparalleled so park attendance would rise, yeah. But if you go back and listen more closely to the things Dr. Wu and Hoskins say, there's a different story.

Remember how Wu couldn't disclose the information to the guy that literally *owns* the park? The cuttlefish DNA for camouflage was one of the things he didn't tell. It was part of the modifications he made to the I-Rex for InGen's military agenda. The I-Rex wasn't built like a damn tank to "up the 'wow' factor" at a theme park at all; it was built to win a war.  




 Jurassic Five 

Jurassic Park 6

Park 7 




 I remember getting the same exact chills when the original theme by him [played at the end of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Pt. 2.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEKA6rmVfW8)

I don't know how Williams does it. 




 My parents literally went to their first  ever midnight premiere for it, and I haven't seen them enjoy a movie so much since we bought the first on VHS. 

It wasn't an Oscar contender by any means, but it was still the most fun I've had watching a movie in a long time. And that relieved the hell out of me because I don't know how pissed I'd have been thinking about how I spent from elementary school to the end of my college career  searching up "Jurassic Park 4" had this thing pulled a Chinese Democracy 









 You just went and banned a subreddit? Probably not a good idea. 









 The park's been open for years by the time this movie takes place. And within years, people tend to forget a lot. Hearing about a tiger mauling a man or a chimpanzee ripping off a woman's face doesn't stop us from going to the zoo.  




 Someone please GIF that. 




 *DISTANT ROAR* 




 **SHE'LL KILL ANYTHING THAT MOVES** 




 I'm seriously regretting listening to 'Our Rex Is Bigger Than Yours' right now because it sounds like the backdrop to a complete spectacle. 
 




 *You've got to mean it, Harry...* 




 Rian Johnson confirmed. 




 You just went and made a new alien? Probably not a good idea. 




 To me, we've been breathing it for centuries. 




 MY NAME IS ALAN GRANT, AND I AM THE SMARTEST PALEONTOLOGIST ALIVE 




 Well, how bout it, Hank? Should I let you go? 




 The [opening scene for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Pt. 1](http://youtu.be/uffmqrjaSh4). It establishes the movie's departure from the others in tone perfectly. 

I love how the music transitions as Hermione walks away from her home. Right when the title pulls up, it immediately shifts to a feel of "now shit's about to down." 




 YOOOOOOO that's my poster on number 6 WE MADE IT FAM 




 For you 




 Whoa. I liked The Lost World, but it always felt a HELL of a lot longer than the first movie.  




 I just had a mental vision of a velociraptor going 'papoy'... 




 uuuu 




 Thank you. Haha that's pure Indominus madness - the thing's jaw is literally supposed to open up to a 90 degree angle [[SPOILERS]](http://i.imgur.com/NotXoH6.jpg). I think they're really trying to push for its unnaturalness.


 




 I went off leaked images and screenshots from the trailer. The two dinosaurs I mentioned are the ones supposedly used to create the Indominus Rex in the movie, and I wanted to try my own take on what that could have resulted in. 

Yeah, it doesn't exist - that's where I saw a fun challenge to take on.  




 Thanks!

Typically on movie posters they put the director's name above the film title in really fine print. It's part of all the credits that get written on the poster. Colin is still pretty new, but his name doesn't go up there to help market the film too much - that's why it's always done in really really fine print.

But if I did want to market it with someone's name, then I'd definitely highlight it more. Like you said, though - Colin's still relatively new to the game so he normally wouldn't be treated like a household name just yet. 

The problem with saying "Steven Spielberg Presents" is that he's only an executive producer for the film, and the authorship is usually credited to the director. If I wanted to market Spielberg on this then I'd say something in bolder letters like "From the producers of *Jurassic Park* and *Transformers*".

TL;DR marketing is weird. 




 Damn, thank you! They don't even need it; the recognition would be awesome. 




 They are. The arms were a lot bigger in my original drawing (and more correctly placed in terms of anatomy), but had to be adjusted to fit in the circle. The [original movie's logo](http://i.imgur.com/uPNp7UO.jpg) did the same thing with the arms of the [skeleton on the book's cover](http://i.imgur.com/UKs7lN6.jpg). 




 Oh absolutely. It parallels the first film by making the logo of the theme park the logo of the film itself. I'd have been a bit frustrated if they went with anything else. 

Thanks, by the way! 









 I'm guessing the placement for the "Damaged" tattoo was done to make a twisted pun. Brain Damage.  




 ***TYRANNO SEASON APPROACHING*** 




 Are they moving? 




 Keep in mind that the title of the movie (in America, at least) is Batman v. Superman, and not Batman vs Superman. I think this movie will be more a battle between ideals than pure strength. The "v." would make sense, considering that'd make it more of a civil dispute than a cage match. 




 WHERE MY THUGGERS AND MY CRIPPERS AND MY BLOODERS AND MY BROTHERS 




 Much Five 




 Here's to you, Phil. 




 Lol the dude's name is PhoneFanatic1 




 ..The... the video..? 




 Hell, even then, Kanye's still diverse with his portfolio. His records get influenced by everything from Nina Simone to films like Ghost in the Shell.

He understands his niche, but he's a lot less likely to be afraid of stepping out of it every now and then. 




 Did they sample the tripod's horn from Spielberg's War of the Worlds?
