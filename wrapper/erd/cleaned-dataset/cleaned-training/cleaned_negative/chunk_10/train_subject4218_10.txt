  You seemed to assume that there is a 'real' "100 Greatest Films" list out there in the ether

I don't, so we can drop that. But I do think that art has value, and I think that criticism has value in as much as it preserves and promotes the value of art. This is my starting point. If you'd like to argue for artistic and critical nihilism, then I think that's a perfectly valid closed system, but it's not engaging with my view. 




 I think this is a very good case for what might make the film *interesting*, particularly to a Hitchcock devotee, but I don't know that any of that amounts to "greatness," you know? Tommy Wiseau's [*The Room*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCj8sPCWfUw) is unquestionably the work of a singular voice, it does everything wrong according to Hollywood standards, it ends in tragedy, the protagonist is kind of nuts, there are several scenes that defy logic--and if I were a critic looking for kicks, I might even call it a deconstruction.

But art can move minds and hearts, if can fuck up your week, it can make you reorganize your life; that's something film is capable of, and that's what I need a great film to do. And I just don't see how the idiosyncrasies of Vertigo approach anything resembling greatness--that's the view to change, I'm afraid. 




 I understand what you're saying, but I disagree. The process of good criticism is finding sense, meaning and truth in the dreamlike ephemera of art. Essentially, I'll consider my view changed if someone can make me *want* to see this movie again--and they'll need to draw on substantive evidence if that's going to happen. 




 For what it's worth, I'll bet you could read the entirety of my post before Kim Novak leaves the museum. 




 Here's the thing: I used to like the movie as much as you did, but then I saw it for the 135th time, and I hated it--as B. Kite later clarified, "Once you've watched *Vertigo* 135 times, the flaws become pretty tough to ignore." 

Just kidding, of course--but perhaps you appreciate what an unconvincing argument that amounts to. If you once held my view and then saw the error of your ways, then let's talk about *that* process, my friend--that's what we're here for, right?

To clarify my point, my issue with Vertigo's canonization isn't that the polls were counted improperly: I simply don't understand what any of these individuals were thinking when they selected it, and I  disagree with the collective result on those grounds.

Finally, to argue against the existence of greatness is to argue against the whole process of creating a film canon, which doesn't intrinsically disagree with my premise: if nothing deserves canonical recognition, then Vertigo doesn't either--but that strikes me as a bit of a departure from the topic at hand either way. 




 I've seen the film a total of four times over the years, for whatever that's worth. I disagree that film criticism isn't rational; I think that the case for or against a film's value can and should be based on evidence within the film and through relevant inter-textual comparison. Lastly, my problem is not that this film is experimental--I love a great many experimental films--it's that its idiosyncrasies don't amount to much in the way of art.  









 This CMV is inspired by the fact that I coincidentally rewatched *Vertigo* the other day, then saw yesterday that it was [number 3 on the BBC's top 100 American films of all time.](http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20150720-the-100-greatest-american-films) It also replaced *Citizen Kane* as Sight   Sound's [top film of all time](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/01/sight-and-sound-2012-vertigo-citizen-kane_n_1729685.html) in 2012. I argue that it has no business in either or indeed any canonical place of honor, and that it is not a great film.

First, this movie is unjustifiably boring. I don't object to a film adopting a deliberately slow pace, but there needs to be some substance within it that merits focus and reflection: the languid sequences of Jimmy Stewart following Kim Novak all over the place, their witless, surface-level courtship scenes--it's a whole lot of poorly paced nothing.

On a related note, I see precious little truth in this movie. Stewart's obsessive "love," while commendably acted, is ridiculous in its premise, particularly when it's undermined entirely by the finale: in discovering that he's had the woman he "loved" beside him all along, he doesn't love her any more? I suppose a generous reading might have something to do with romantic projections and the feelings of betrayal they can inspire, but it comes at the expense of Kim Novak's character in a huge way, and it indisputably chucks any investment in their romance out the window. There's very little in the end to give any sense of who she *really* was underneath it all, rendering her love of him and his love of her a shallow, ridiculous bit of dramatic puffery that wasn't worth the hour it had demanded.

Thirdly, this flick is a mess in terms of tone. Remember that scene where the Midge character tried to give Jimmy Stewart a self-portrait? It's either a strange and ultimately unresolved dramatic beat, or a particularly cruel comedic one, and I don't like it either way. There are mysterious elements, but they don't make for much in the way of dread; there are romantic elements, but it amounts to nothing more than the myopia of any given teen crush. By the time one arrives at the end of this film, one is seriously wondering what it was all these disparate elements were supposed to add up to.

Fourth, I don't think this film is all that special visually. I'm more than willing to give it credit for the retrozoom, but I don't think that that one flashy move has had nearly the impact of, say, Orson Welles's deep focus photography or Eisenstein's montage or Godard's jump cuts or Keaton's multiple exposures or Disney's animation or basically any other visual innovation you can think of--in an art defined by its optics, that one neat trick is decidedly on the gimmicky end of things. Beyond that, I'd say it's a good-looking film, but not particularly extraordinary in the context of  its predecessors, its contemporaries, or its successors.

And finally, narrative film is capable of a great deal more than anything *Vertigo* aspires to. Even if this film were a visual masterpiece (it's not), there's no reason why screenwriting as a medium should be held to a lower standard than any great play--try watching *Death of a Salesman* (1949) and then this; try comparing it to *Waiting for Godot* (1953) or *A Streetcar Named Desire* (1947), and tell me which of those works is addressing the human condition. If this turgid romance is the best that film has to offer, then that's embarrassing.

To put all my cards on the table, I should also acknowledge that I perhaps unfairly associate *Vertigo* with a particularly tedious neo-Freudian school of film theory. Somewhere along the line, film theorists became obsessed with Sigmund Freud and his disciples, and subsequently never made any effort to advance their understanding of the human mind in keeping with contemporary science (David Bordwell's cognitive approach to film studies being one notable exception). *Vertigo* was once a selection in an Art Film class I had, and the professor went off on some rant about how this film's dream sequence incontrovertibly symbolized castration--yeah ok buddy. 

And I have to say, I think that has a lot to do with why this movie has found favor with contemporary critics: its trite engagement with fetishization and sublimation allows certain critics a canvas on which to project their niche fascinations, and makes them feel important for knowing the "code." It's an artificial barrier between the academic and the laymen that has far more to do with subculture than capacity for intelligence or insight, and critics devalue their vocation when they allow themselves to get caught up in that stuff.

*All that said*, I enjoy liking things, and if there's a way for me to like this movie, I'd very much like to find it. In its favor, I think Jimmy Stewart is a very good actor. And the colors are quite nice in places. And that retrozoom, bravo. But measuring *Verigo's* faults against what the medium at its best ought to strive for, this cannot be considered a great film.

 It's pretty common in the film/video world, at least on the critical/theoretical side of things--you'll read analysis of Citizen Kane's deep focus cinematography, for example. 




 I'd just like to acknowledge you for sticking to your guns on a very unpopular argument. To be clear, I personally have no love for your consumerist approach to art, but I have to give you credit for standing by it and not pandering to the community here. And even if I find very little to relate to personally in what you're saying, I appreciate that your take on it, unpopular as it may be, reflects something true in what it is to be human--you're using whatever opportunities you've been given to you to authentically articulate your experience.

And even if your mode of thought never finds a wide audience in r/filmmakers, you can at least rest assured that your comments exist in some small corner of the reddit canon forever. Even if only a handful of redditors ever upvote it, you will at least have made that small human connection forever. You're not here to feed this audience what it wants to hear about art and purpose, you're here with the truth as you see it, reception be damned. Kudos. 




 War. 




 517, thanks! 




 **720:** [Contrary to popular belief, the three primary subtractive colors are yellow, cyan, and magenta--*not* red, yellow and, blue.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_color) 




 Well I *know* my birthday, I just wasn't really anticipating it and was surprised to realize that it was today. As a single 26 year old, there isn't too much fanfare about it. 




 That has to be some kind of milestone, haha. 




 Oh I agree that a difference of opinion doesn't make one nuts--thus my acknowledgement that there is an intellectual debate to be had on the issue. Framing it as an issue of totalitarian enslavement, however, *is* nuts and I'm pretty comfortable calling it as much. 




 I hear what you're saying, but my issue is with the means of *enforcing* rights. I don't take it as granted that a state mandate to provide a service allows the use of force on its subjects. Imagaine a world in which we have exactly two rights: the right to an education, and the right *not* to be conscripted into teaching. I don't see that as a contradiction, I see that as an obligation for the state to non-violently incentivise teachers until the right to an education is met.

Of course, it's easy to imagine a world in which the right to an education isn't met, just as it's easy to imagine a world in which I'm murdered in spite of my right to life. All the same, our inability to provide a 100% success rate has no bearing on whether or not there's a moral good to striving for that right.

Another point of diversion might be that I don't really see rights as immutable or intrinsic. I'd go so far as to say I've never encountered a coherent secular defense of intrinsic rights, though I'm absolutely open to hearing one--it would make my ethics a lot cleaner, to be sure. For Rand and for the framers of the constitution, I suppose it comes down to the Creator; for me, I wouldn't presuppose a Creator's existence let alone Its intentions--that would seem to tie rights up in a whole mess of apologetics that I've yet to encounter any ironclad answer to either.

That leaves the idea of rights in a somewhat arbitrary place, but that doesn't mean they don't have value so long as we believe in and abide by them. If there are two people on an island, I would think that their rights are as simple as what they can agree to provide for each other. For me, I would think it imperative to provide medical assistance to the best of one's ability if at all possible. But maybe I'm on an island with Rand Paul and he doesn't think we have that right; fair enough, in that case we don't.

Basically, rights are so difficult to pin down philosophically that I can't help but think about them practically. 




 I guess I'm just not seeing why violent conscription should factor into philosophical rights at all. In a world in which all teachers and doctors are unwilling to provide service to the poor, I would think that that would be an example of the state failing to follow through on a right that it had promised--we would need to rethink how to incentivise public work certainly, but it wouldn't even occur to me that we should violently chuck the service provider's liberty out the window. 




 I see it as a right very much on par with education: teachers aren't conscripted at gunpoint to serve in low-income public schools, they do it because they have values that transcend a market-centric approach to existence. 




 Look, whatever a man wants to personally endorse in the privacy of his own home is fine with me, but that don't mean I gotta *like* him for jibber-jabberin' through a bunch of dehumanizin' semantics on the TV. 




 Well, he's kind of nuts, isn't he? [Here he is side by side with alternative Reddit favorite son Bernie Sanders in a back and forth on health care](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUXwDMqjC-A)--there's a substantive intellectual debate to be had about whether we have the means and/or obligation to guarantee basic health care as a fundamental right, and then there's whatever the fuck fantasy scenario he's going on about there. 




 "You are the universe in drag." A simple sentence that somehow unifies the cosmic, the sociological and the personal; it really did affect my personal engagement gender and identity. Fantastic interview. 




 Racists aren't big on nuance. 




 You subscribe to an "Intelligent Deign" theory of capitalist  socio-economic oppression, I see. I'm inclined to think that it's self-replicating unconsciously, myself--just the same gold old-fashioned self-perpetuating evolution that runs everything, continually selecting for single-minded commitment to continued growth every quarter forever, narrowing the pool down to a smaller, specialized more efficient elite year by year; silly bastards probably have no real concept of poor people, why should they? 




 His work has especially resonated in the humanities, no question. I think a lot of the beef with him as an ostensibly scientific figure is that so much of his work was wildly unfalsifiable. That's broadly considered to make for pretty bad science--truth be told, I don't love it as a dominant mode of thought in the humanities either. 




 The OP is emphasizing multiplayer, which absolutely does make a difference. Setting industry stuff aside, a century from now a person will be able to dig up Game of Thrones and engage with it in full as a piece of art/entertainment--not so with Team Fortress or Journey. That doesn't apply to all games, but the collective experience is something that games *can* do in a way that film and literature can't, it's been around for as long as the medium has existed, and it is in turn pretty central to its identity--games just can't sustain ongoing, organic multiplayer forever. It's kind of like theater in that regard: you can read Shakespeare, but you can't go see his theater troop at the Globe.

By thew same token, I think the answer is to "mount a revival" every once in awhile. If a group of like-minded gamers want to explore multiplayer gaming history, they'll have to organize it themselves, either online or off. It just requires some extra effort and coordination. 




 Sure, and I respect where you're coming from--I think that in the end we might just each be concerned with different issues at the moment, but that that we probably have a lot of common values nonetheless. Cheers. 




 I don't know if or to what extent you have a personal history with gangs or drug abuse. If so, then I suspect we share a deep sympathy for those most deeply affected by the illegal drug trade, and for the social and chemical pressures they're up against. At the same time--and I apologize if it sounds callous to say so--one's experience doesn't give one any more licence to make up statistics than anyone else. I understand where your number is coming from and the philosophy behind it, but you're claim that drug dealers are directly morally accountable for the deaths of drug users is an opinion, not a fact, and mixing that in with objective claims is deliberately misleading.

To your other claims, though, gang members definitely don't "jump at the chance" to kill cops, it's not even remotely in their self-interest. That's always been reason enough to doubt this sensational claim, and now that somebody's actually bothered to ask those accused and they refute it, that's the side that reason leads me to.

And to your main point--which I missed because you never got around to making it, my friend--American law enforcement, throughout history and right up to the present day, has not systemically earned the trust that you're giving them, flat out. 




 Call it what we will, I think we both understand that it's a made up number, right? Over or under, you guessed it and stated it as fact without clear terms or citations. I appreciate where you're coming from factoring drug and alcohol related deaths, but that is certainly not a "direct" killing in the sense that murder is. 

And it has jack squat to do with this highly publicized threat of a gang conspiracy to murder police officers; that's what the department is currently stoking fear of, and what my comment was about. Drug dealers, terrorists, and falling pianos all kill people, fine. That doesn't make any excuse for racial fear-mongering in our heavily armed police force. 




 I have to ask, why bother fabricating the number 600? The actual number of homicides, 445 in [2013](http://data.baltimoresun.com/bing-maps/homicides/index.php?range=2013 district=all zipcode=all age=all gender=all race=all cause=all article=all show_results=Show+results) and [2014](http://data.baltimoresun.com/bing-maps/homicides/index.php?range=2014 district=all zipcode=all age=all gender=all race=all cause=all article=all show_results=Show+results)  combined according to the Baltimore Sun, is plenty. The percentage of those deaths that are black men--[198 of 235 in 2013](http://data.baltimoresun.com/bing-maps/homicides/index.php?range=2013 district=all zipcode=all age=all gender=male race=black cause=all article=all show_results=Show+results), and [173 of 211 in 2014](http://data.baltimoresun.com/bing-maps/homicides/index.php?range=2014 district=all zipcode=all age=all gender=male race=black cause=all article=all show_results=Show+results), for a total of 83% of all homicides--is certainly a staggaring number, but it's definitely not 600 directly drug-related. Why reduce your own argument to a 60% exaggeration?

And why are police doing the same thing? With an *actual* murder problem to contend with, why spin a bunch of idiot kids fucking up the protest downtown into a crips and bloods gang conspiracy?

These exaggerations are created by fear, which they then in turn perpetuate. And that fear puts fingers on triggers, which in turn creates only more death and mistrust. That's not the only problem in America, but it is the one I'm talking about right now. 




 Here we go again: a well-armed, government-backed police force scares itself silly over angry young black men based on rumor, assumption and self-pity. This is characteristic of the same fear that killed Trayvon Martin for wearing a hoodie, convinced that cop in Ferguson that Michael Brown was a "demon," shot 12-year-old Tamir Rice for playing with a toy gun.

Now every beat cop in Baltimore is convinced that there's a young black gang conspiracy gunning for them. Racial paranoia combined with deadly force--we've seen it before, we see it now, we'll see it again. And next time it goes to trial, once again we'll hear how the officer "feared for their life." And we won't take a second look at where that fear came from. 




 Well, your other option would be to obey the law--you know, "play by the rules" and "be part of society," all that other moralistic horseshit with which you folks so casually justify the suffering of the poor. Then again, that sort of thing has never sat too well with "you people," has it. 









 OP: c'mon it's not that seeious. 




 All due respect, that's nonsense. People should be allowed to talk about sex with whatever level of frankness they want. What wound up being unintentionally hurtful here was that she was saying one thing to her friend and another thing to Fiver here, a little more loving frank talk with him might have enabled them to build a more honest and fulfilling sex life from the start.

To OP: your dick is fine, it's not broken, it's not deformed, but it's also not magic and that's okay, it's just a dick like everybody else's. Somebody loves you, don't fuck that up stressing about your dumb dick. 




 Bearing in mind that you're free to process life how you choose and that we'll all live and die confused anyway, I say fuck magical thinking.

Explore and understand who you are and what you wish to be. Feel the pain and the pleasure of making choices, of working hard, of creating meaning for yourself. Don't settle for easy answers; stare down the beautiful and the horrible, the things you can control and the things you can't.

And, when you're ready, imagine a world in which there was never any magic--*not one bit*. Somewhere in the vastness of infinity, there was an inevitable, beautiful little fuckup of a chemical reaction that sought out patterns in the randomness, and that's what all the fuss has been about ever since.

And you breathe it in and breathe it out. And it might feel wonderful and it might feel awful, but neither feeling is forever. And your lungs take in the oxygen and release the carbon dioxide, and plants grow out of the ground and rain falls out of the sky.

And what comes next is completely up to you. 




 Maybe it wasn't *quite* as bad as everyone said, but it sure wasn't good. Rather than pay off all the choices you'd personally made along the way, it just plopped the same big arbitrary, enigmatic choice in front of everybody. And then, *bafflingly*, the option to destroy all synthetics allowed your Shepard to live--never mind that organic/synthetic peacemaking had been a cornerstone of my story. It removed all stakes from your prior choices, then utterly failed to explore or even *explain* the stakes of this new, unrelated choice, the most meaningful demonstrable consequence of which was a shift in color scheme over a fairly artless closing cinematic--for a game that had up to that point been all about making meaningful decisions, that was a big old fuckbotch.

 




 Hmm. Well, either your kids' curiosity gets the better of them when you're not around, or you wound up with a scummy sub. Either way I'm sorry you went through that, and you can at least take solace in the fact that most subs won't need to be told this stuff. 




 I think most adults would be capable of putting that together. Kids, on the other hand, might be eager to unwrap presents without as much thought toward proper ownership. I think it's quite possible that that's what went down here. 









 ...

that might be *the* most cringe-worthy edit i've ever seen. Yikes. 




 Well, yes, that is *literally* Filmmaking 101, and CK, who's been some kind of filmmaker for however many decades now, has his own style. 

*Louie's* drawn out sequences nearly always emphasize performances, with the result being that even minor characters in his unsteady world are given weight and reality--I'm thinking of the surrogate in the hallway from the Season 5 opener, and the incredible dynamism that the actress is allowed to display within just a few minutes.

Those sorts of scenes may seem simple, but they require a lot of discipline, a lot of vision, and a lot of talented collaborators; I think it makes for incredibly compelling comedy. 




 This is an intriguing approach to personality in that when extrapolated, it sort of extends the same treatment we give philosophers to every Tom, Dick and Harry on XBox Live. I mean, how many times have you read about a thinker or artist whose personal life seems totally incongruous with the philosophy of their work? Yet in the end, any big name in thought invariably refers to a philosophy rather than a biography.

While it's obviously a stretch to consider the Navy Seal tough guy internet persona a philosophy, there is a sense in which it occupies that same nebulous space in which Rousseau abandoned his children and wrote "On Education," John Lennon espoused love and was by all accounts terrible to his loved ones, communist thought is so often a pastime of the idle rich, etc. There is the person making dumb animal choices in some unavoidable social context moment to moment, but there is also the collection of ideas that they *choose* to be when free of that context--it is so entirely and deliberately who they are that they fabricate the identity completely.

I wouldn't go so far as to say that one or the other is the "true" version of any given person, but I can certainly appreciate that line being blurred--and why *shouldn't* the matter be just as complicated in everyone as it is in the academic/popular/historical upper echelon? 




 Mm hmm. I think that attitude speaks volumes: if it doesn't reinforce your worldview, it isn't real. My grandpa's illness and my grandmother's sacrifice are so negligible to you as to be hilarious, while "speaking generally" about how women want "money, gifts and jobs" is some big fucking truth that the world can't handle. Get your shit together, man, that's no kind of person to be.

I'm getting the sense that, bottom line, I grew up around and seek out intelligent, self-sufficient women; you seem to live in a different world. And you're right, the "real world" you've sunk yourself into doesn't make much sense to me--personally, I think you ought to "red pill" the fuck on out of it. 




 What the fuck are you laughing at. 




 That's a funny word, "sacrifice." When I think about it, the first thing that comes to mind is how when my grandfather got Alzheimer's, my grandmother gave him in-home care through a heartbreaking deterioration across several years until it finally took his life. So when I read the claim that men bear all of life's sacrifices for ungrateful women, I have a hard time thinking anything other than "go live a life you dumb fuck." 




 Listen my friend, I don't know who you are, and I don't know who you think I am, but you're saying a lot of very grand things that don't have much baring on what I'm trying to express.

I'm speaking in support of an approach to men's mental health that addresses uniquely masculine issues without ceding the valuable progress toward gender equality that women have made. You're... I don't know. You're a fan of competition and of "REALITY," I gather. 

But you're not really talking *to* me, at least certainly not about the things I'm talking about. So if you want to talk, let's talk. I'll listen if you will. 




 Disposable isn't actually the key word: it's a bit semantic, but there's a significant difference between calling men **a** disposable population and **the** disposable population--one is about an issue a group faces, the other situates that issue in opposition to the outsiders' issues. And something as small as that can make the difference between inviting and excluding your potential allies, you know? It can mean the difference between engaging with others and festering in one's own anger. **Words matter.** And  the more one accentuates exclusionary language, the more alienation one takes in and puts out. 




 I'm sorry, I just have no idea where you're coming from with that. [Men complete suicide at a rate three to four times that of women](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_differences_in_suicide#Rates), and to neatly tie *all* of that suffering in with the misplaced anger of the "men's rights" thing is just careless in every sense of the word.

I can forgive the temptation to homogenize it all though, simply because the angry people are loud and the more benign sufferers don't feel they have a voice--and of course there is some significant crossover, how could there not be. But my point is that one need not (and obviously *should* not) be a misogynist in order to support better health care for a vulnerable population. I think we should find a way for advocates and sufferers to talk about uniquely male problems without crucifying women, and I think that that's a conversation that a lot of men out there are waiting for. 




 Yeah, I was trying to have a conversation about compassion, and you came in with some spiel about how competition is the essence of life. Unrelated, misanthropic. 




 I think that what your talking about is a very real phenomenon: a Great Male Anger that can barely keep track of what it's angry about, because that might mean confronting the injustice of its entitlements; it instead rails against some fictive hyper-powerful feminism, and is now parading through this thread in full force.

I *don't* think, however, that that adequately accounts for the astronomical male suicide rate. There is also a Great Male Sadness that affects men like the father described in this article; it doesn't seek special privileges so much as identity and understanding. And I'm frustrated to see the ignorant anger drowning out the gentler sadness in conversation, here and elsewhere. 




 My friend, there's no other sense in which your interjections jive with the conversation:

Some guy:
 It IS harder to be a man in today's society.

Me:

 my point is that it's not a competition.

You chime in:

This statement flies in the face of overwhelming evidence that nature , life, evolution, etc is nothing but competition. [...] Pretending this isn't a fact is the basest form of ignorance.

I'd counter that the basest form of ignorance might involve cherry-picking context free sentence fragments from a conversation about suicide as a platform to launch into your unrelated platform of general misanthropy, but you do you. 




 Life is a competition between men and women as to who is more victimized by modern society, and pretending otherwise is the basest form of ignorance. Cool. Got it. 




 Well, if that's all you're saying, then you've said it, I've heard it, have a good one. 




 Well, it's clearly a statement of opinion. *But anyway.*

I don't know that I'm following your point. How does the privileged status of women, as you perceive it, affect society's ability to provide better support for men in any meaningful way? 




 I'm sure many people agree with you, and many people disagree with you; my point is that it's not a competition. 




 I think there's a lot of poignancy to your last paragraph, about how young men are being prepared by their fathers for a world that doesn't need them. I also think that that poignancy stands on its own, and that contrasting that issue with feminist concerns or lamenting the support available to women wouldn't add anything to your well-made point but a superimposed binary conflict. The funny thing is--and I say this with my tongue at least partway in my cheek--I literally can't think of a better example of a group being let down by patriarchy than what you describe. But elsewhere in this thread, I see men leading with that sort of male/female conflict, dwelling on it, even reveling in it a bit.

So that's a subtle distinction, perhaps, but it is an important one: there's no reason for male advocacy to be advanced in opposition to the gains made by women. When men start this conversation by saying that it it's an inevitably binary issue, or that men are "the disposable sex" and women by extension have it better, it seems to be picking a weird fight with the wrong people--particularly given the issues that women all over the world have faced throughout history and continue to face today. We should celebrate the emotional freedom and support afforded to women, and seek it for ourselves without resentment. 




 I really appreciate your articulation of the problem here, I don't know that I've ever considered it with such clarity--I've often just opted out of the subject because I couldn't imagine identifying with all that rhetorical toxicity. It certainly is sad to see such bitter, aggressive, tribalistic ugliness dominating a conversation that ought to revolve around compassion. 




 MediaMonkey looks promising, hopefully that works out. Thanks a ton! 




 It seems that podcasting is getting bigger all the time every day and all that, and yet there still doesn't seem to be a decent PC podcast player. iTunes has that non-optional "feature" where it continually stops updating feeds that you only listen to occasionally, and it autoplays all your old podcasts  in reverse chronological order unless you build a playlist or put it on shuffle--it's just an inexcusably idiotic setup for a major corporate software release, and I'd like to delete that shit once and for all.

Problem is, there seems to be at least one or two equally boneheaded shortcomings in every alternative I try. This is all I need a podcast grabber to do:

* **Download episodes automatically for offline listening**
* **Play episodes from within the program**
* **Stop playing when an episode concludes**
* **Clean up old episodes once a certain amount of time has passed and/or a certain number of new episodes have been released**
* **Arrange individual feeds alphabetically, and the episodes in all feeds according to most recent release**

That's it. Thing is, *nothing* on PC seems capable of delivering on all five of those requirements. BeyondPod works great on Android, but I do a ton of listening on my laptop while working--each unhelpful iTunes update just drives me nuts all over again.

**So, what halfway decent programs are out there right now? Surely there must be something.** 




 quick response, thanks! 




  I'm reading what your saying and blasting holes in it

**Oh please.**

Listen, the fact that we're still arguing about this stupid stupid movie means that we're both crazy. We're two lunatics talking past each other into the void, a cruel parody of any attempt to find meaning in art in the metamodern world. Fine. I accept that, and I hereby embrace it.

I only ever wanted to say that there are plenty of valid reasons to dislike the movie, and to remind *Chappie* fans that their beloved robot friend exists in a world of dominant critical standards and personal subjectivity that allows plenty of space for a negative reaction. The critics aren't crazy, they needn't have their heads up their asses, nor did they see a different movie as so many have suggested. That's all. I never wanted to ruin it for anyone.

But fine! Let's ruin it! Let's "blast holes" in any and every excuse you want to make for it. *Chappie* fucking sucks, and you shouldn't enjoy it; enjoying it is incorrect. You want a nutso crazy person internet argument about a shitty movie? *Let's get nutso.*

**I stand by my central point: your reaction to the character of Chappie will make all the difference in how you respond to this film.** 

That whole journey from a baby to a teen to an independent adult thing? **Bull Good Goddamn Shit.** That idea of expedited growing up isn't bad in itself--that's why it's such a well-worn premise--but the execution here is just ridiculous. Chappie maintains the same preposterous mix of intelligence and idiocy through the entire fucking movie, advancing and regressing at random in whatever contrived direction the plot needs him to go. 

**What teen or adult talks like that? Seriously.** [If Chappie is any sort of adult, he is an adult baby weirdo.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbqV20PwNP0#t=1m18s)* When the story needs him to be smart, he's capable of transcribing consciousness. When the story needs him to be dumb, **he's all kinds of precious about auto theft and knife crime.** Rather than provide Chappie with an *actual* arc toward maturity, the film continually falls back on the **low-effort pathos of shallow cuteness**, because the game as up as soon you see past it.

And hey, remember those two minutes where Chappie was going to become a painter or something? Neil Blomcamp sure doesn't **"Chappie, you must always be creative!" What a fucking joke.** The big payoff of his journey into adulthood is to solve everything with guns and brutality. That's a dropped plot line, a lazy resolution and a really shit moral all rolled into one right there.

Which reminds me: ***is* this movie supposed to be for kids? I had no idea.** It was rated R in my country, which means it's intended for adults and that children can't be admitted without a guardian--I sure as hell wouldn't want my kid internalizing all this grisly, glorified, consequence-free violence. **We're either selling paramilitary gun worship to children, or we're selling Mommy Daddy Doodoo Baby bullshit to adults. Fuck all that.**

So, that is the context in which we arrive at all the plot holes. **CONSCIOUSNESS. DAT:** I think I've said my piece on that, and only wish to add that **that development is not trivial, it is not the tiniest of things, it is the climactic resolution of the entire goddman movie.** I mean... just... fuck. There's making your peace with the little things, sure, but then then there's consciousness dot fucking dat.

**Your explanation of that walking out with the key thing:** Here's what I'm imagining: if I had a star employee who made my company billions and who I really respected, he'd get an office instead of a cubicle. I wouldn't laugh in his face during his proposals. I might go out of my way to ensure that no other employees threaten him with a fucking gun on company property during work hours, and might facilitate swift disciplinary action if an episode like that ever transpired. **Nothing that happens in the film indicates anything like the relationship of respect you're describing.** But even if it did, you still ought to take that one and only robot army key pretty goddamn seriously. Some kind of contingency plan for if it goes missing, some kind of GPS tracking or something. I mean, it's a security company. Just... just... fuck! You know? That's not a small thing!

**Anyway, I'm tired of thinking about fucking *Chappie*.** If you want to keep doing this, then I guess you can "blast holes" in another one in five of my arguments, and I can write another essay tomorrow night because I'm crazy. **Or** maybe we can do the friendly internet handshake, and I can go back to thinking that even if I don't like the movie, it's fine if others do. Maybe you'll agree that disliking *Chappie* is perhaps a not entirely unreasonable position, that even if you liked it, it's fine if others don't. That's all I really want, man. Can we do that?

 nbsp;

^* ^all ^due ^respect ^to ^the ^adult ^babies ^out ^there, ^we're ^all ^weirdos. 




 Mmm-hmm. So, you're trying to push me toward an extreme position here, and I'll not have it, thank you. I didn't say transcribing consciousness into one big file called CONSCIOUSNESS.DAT was tautologically *impossible*, I said it was a groaner, and given that it's facilitated by a being who can't get a handle on impersonal pronouns or how murder works, I think "groaner" it putting it quite mildly.

And that isn't *one* detail that I'm "blowing out of proportion," I've only ever characterized it as one laughably implausible plot turn among many. The movie's dumb, okay? I'll go that far. It's a dumb movie, and dumb movies only work if you're having a good time. I didn't, because none of the characters resonated with me, and Chappie actively annoyed the shit out of me.

And please, look at the substance of my argument rather than nitpicking it: if you had a good enough time with this movie to overlook its flaws, then good for you. But its critics are not a bunch of fun-hating obsessive compulsives who took against it because we're full of hate or something. A lot of sensible, joyful, movie-loving people think this movie sucks, and *Chappie*-lovers ought to make their peace with that. 




 The issue isn't whether a bunch of consoles could provide a quick and dirty mainframe; it's whether they can unlock human consciousness in a file called CONSCIOUSNESS.DAT--sorry, that's a groaner for me. But as I said, you'll either be charitable or uncharitable toward that kind of thing depending on whether you're charmed by the Stabby Baby Mommy Daddy Gangsta stuff, and I just wasn't at all. 




 ...

What are you talking about? Is anyone paying for your opinion? 




 Not at all, I love movies. 




 Not at all, just making a case for my reaction to the movie. 




 Well, that does explain why so many people never realized that this movie sucks*[OHHHHHHHHHHHH](http://i.imgur.com/r73VJe3.gifv)* 




 If that's your bar for "compelling as fuck," then again, god bless. Just appreciate that it isn't everyone's. 




 Quick remider to the *Chappie* street team on here:

 *If you think something contributes to conversation, upvote it. If you think it does not contribute to the subreddit it is posted in or is off-topic in a particular community, downvote it.*
 
 *Consider posting constructive criticism / an explanation when you downvote something, and do so carefully and tactfully.*

So. Listen *Chappie* fans, I'm glad you liked the movie. Life is hard and you have to take your enjoyments where you can get em--I don't want to deprive you of any happiness.

*BUT* I don't think it's any great mystery why a movie about an **idiot baby-talking gangster** didn't land with a lot of people. If you saw a compelling character there then that's cool; I saw **Jar Jar Fucking Binks with a knife and a gold chain**.

How you respond to the character probably goes a long way toward how you then feel as the dingbat sci-fi elements pile up, and sweet jesus do they ever. 98% artificial intelligence... just a few red bulls to go! A bunch of PS4s unlock a transhumanist paradigm shift that fits neatly into a file called CONSCIOUSNESS.DAT. **"You know that one and only key to our entire paramilitary robot army? Just bring it back when you can, please."**

Chappie has the entire internet in his brain, but can't put together what's going on when he robs and stabs people--and boy howdy, this ostensibly heroic robot sure does perpetrate a lot of dumbass violence, doesn't he? **Yes, I get that he's only hurting/killing people because he's a fucking moron. No, that doesn't endear him to me.**

I won't say you're wrong for liking this whatever-the-fuck-it-was, but you are, my friends, very *very* wrong if you think this movie is unassailable. 




 Is that meant to be DVI? If so, I'm interested!
 




 Hey Nashville, anybody have a PC monitor that they'd be willing to part with at a low low price? I'm setting up a new PC on the cheap, and the only thing I really need in a monitor is an HDMI or DVI hookup. Thanks! 




 Well, let's look at it:

There is a specific reason that this war was the setting of the novel: not because of who America was, not because of who Germany was, but because Vonnegut was there: "That was I. That was me." He didn't write about some greater or lesser massacre than Dresdon, he wrote about the massacre he attended. To the extent that he situates the Dreson bombing geopolitically, it had no particular strategic value and was enacted as the revenge of one agreed-upon conception of a nation against another, perpetrated by soldiers on civilians.

In the face of that massacre (for Vonnegut at least), all geopolitics simply disappeared. And you and I can comfortably think, "well, the Nazi government was doing horrible things, and when you look at these killings against these other killings..." and there's truth there. But this book was about a different truth: a massacre is a massacre is a massacre.

So, it's preposterous to me that this book should have some historical responsibility to *be about* something else, particularly as far as that involves contextualizing military campaigns for christ's sake. "[T]here's nothing intelligent to say about a massacre."

What does the imagined critic want, a chapter on how bad Hitler was? We already know, that's not the point, and those justifications only distance you from the reality of what it actually looks like when you burn tens of thousands of conscious human men, women and children.

You might respond to that with tears, you might rejoice in righteous sadism. You might become unstuck in time, never quite able to make sense of what causes anything again. 




 Yeah, I'd say any criticism of *Slaughterhouse Five* that so clearly misses the point need not be extrapolated in any sense.

 lest they walk away not realizing that [...] we should not cry for them that one of their cities was bombed into oblivion

And I wonder if you missed the point too, my friend. 




 Lot's of energy and little focus? Oh no! WHY ISN'T MY DOG ACHIEVING!? 




 While not an expert, I'm a big fan of the 60s and 70s [New Hollywood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hollywood) era in American film. That said, I rewatched *One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest* the other day for the first time in a few years, and was struck by two things: 1) the film is an extraordinarily rich and sensitive portrait of a very diverse group of white men, and 2) not so much anyone else--Chief has his moments of course, but that's about it. And if someone told me that the movie, for all its sensitivity, was pretty racist and sexist in terms of how it portrayed the much vilified hospital staff, I wouldn't argue with them.

I don't necessarily mean that as a knock against the film, because of course it's allowed to operate within its own scope, and in that sense it's a beautiful movie, maybe even a great one. But it got me thinking about New Hollywood protagonists in general, and how the heroes of that era were so often disillusioned counter-cultural white men, generally straight. When you look at the era's dominant themes of systemic oppression and broken American promises, it seems strange that we've almost exclusively canonized white men as mouthpieces of the movement.

**So I guess I'm basically looking for movie recommendations outside of the hip white male myopia.** What are some films, either of that era or in that ethos, that embody the **themes**, the **poetry**, the **cool** and the **humor** of the 70s New Hollywood outside the white male antihero paradigm? Looking for something different both in terms of the stories told and the people behind the camera, while retaining that subversive, thoughtful and entertaining spirit. 




 ***Being John Malkovich***, besides being a trip in itself, could easily be read as a commentary on the general practice of altering one's mind; I think you'll find it quite relevant to your interests. You'll also find an engaging mix of profundity and batshittery in ***Repo Man***, ***Eraserhead***, ***My Winnepeg*** and ***Brazil***, while a more demandingly arty, introspective journey might wind through ***Solaris***, ***The Seventh Seal*** and/or ***Contempt***. Approach ***Antichrist*** at your own risk. 




 Ah, gotcha. Well, it's not my sense that Fry himself is presenting this view as anything groundbreaking; it's simply the side of the argument--ancient as it is--that resonates with him.

To your point though, I can very much agree that if people are calling this "devastating" in the sense that the argument is new to them, they are in fact themselves new to a very old argument. 




 Seems like we're talking past each other a bit here. To clarify, I'm not making an argument for "relative truth" or some such, I'm only arguing for philosophical charity, and perhaps a friendly touch of humility.

I invoked the Christian plurality here simply to demonstrate that this is a subject that has not thusfar been conclusively "solved" by pure rationality (as in mathematical truths) nor can it really be supported empirically (as in proper psychological theories). There are ways of approaching truth in other studies that don't seem to help us much here--that's not to say that there is no truth, just that we can't know it in the same sense that 1+1=2 or that the Earth orbits the sun and all that.

Because there are still arguments going on within and without classical apologetics, I wouldn't automatically assume that anyone arrived at their position through hypocrisy and negligence, that's all. 




 Well, I'll bite. Why is a general presumption of intelligence and good faith when engaging with varied beliefs incompatible with the study of psychology? 




 I don't think that that's fair. Whatever your personal answer to the "problem of evil" is, other people of faith have very different answers to it--it then stands to reason that someone might studiously engage with the question from another angle and arrive at the conclusion that there is no satisfactory answer.

If there were *one* tautological Christian answer then that'd be one thing, but the plurality of Christian responses means that one could in good faith arrive at a non-Christian answer as well. 




 I'd really like to ask any given stranger what their conception of god is, ask what last moved them to tears, find some secret hope we both share for ourselves and mankind and promise to kindle it in each other forever, and then tell them I love them and really mean it.

It kind of breaks my heart that I can't. 




 Weekenders! Good show. 




  Given time the good comments will rise to the top.

That's wishful thinking. A large portion of the internet will always vote for that which most validates their worldview while requiring the least amount of effort to engage with. That will hardly ever be an ideal editorial system, and when the topic is philosophy it's practically toxic to good conversation. A balanced moderation policy is crucial to maintaining any quality aggregate. 




 Yeah. This is pretty fucking embarrassing. 




 It's an old expression. As a society, we've really been hot-fucking in the proverbial ass. 




 While I appreciate the concession, your point clearly does *not* stand--your initial post claimed that they wanted to be "**the** subreddit about gender," whereas their stated goal is literally the opposite of that: to be just one platform, addressing a specific point of view.

It's rude to barge into other peoples' conversations, particularly if you only want to talk about how an issue affects you. You did that to a bunch of feminists and the issue was **rape**--I really don't know what the hell you expected. They owe you nothing. 




 Funny, it's my understanding that they want to be "**a** subreddit for thoughtful content - serious or silly - related to gender, and intended for women's perspectives."

When you find yourself summing up other people in simplistic terms, a good rule of thumb is fuck off. 




 I recently busted my cheap android tablet, and the screen has lost most of its touch functionality. I do have a little USB keyboard though, and I've found that I can use that to get through my lockscreen, launch apps, do very very basic stuff like that.

What I'd like to do though, is find a customizable app that will let me use the keyboard to virtually touch different places on the screen. For example, I press "F1" and the device recognizes a touch in the upper right corner, "F2" and it's halfway down the middle, hold "Alt" and it simulates dragging, that kind of thing.

If this app exists, I can't for the life of me figure out which search terms will get me to it. Does anyone know if such a theoretical Broken Screen Helper app is out there? I'd happily give a few bucks to keep this device functional while I search for a replacement. 




 No idea what any one of those things has to do with the other, but you seem to be on the right track there, champ. 




 That Jason Mraz song "I'm Yours," the lyric "it's our God-forsaken right to be loved." That's either a hard fucking turn through existential antitheism, or he's a dipshit who was trying to make getting his dick sucked sound important. 




 I should clarify where I'm coming from here: I wouldn't describe myself as confused about homosexuality (though some here would disagree, most likely); I'm wholeheartedly on the side of LGBT acceptance and equality.

My interest in this thread was more rooted in trying to understand traditions different from my own, and in challenging myself to approach such differences with an eye toward shared humanity rather than ideological conflict--it's why I subscribe to this sub and many other subs outside my day-to-day experience.

I'm hesitant to express my negativity here, because I recognize that I'm an outsider and have no right to expect this community to cater to my worldview, but this thread has been a very disheartening read for me. These are all the same arguments that I hear from American neoconservatives, slippery sloping through all the same generalizations and falling into all the same logical fallacies.

The answers that draw on Sharia and the Quran are the most edifying, but I have little sympathy for what they espouse: apparently arbitrary law, violently enforced--these verses would be right at home on placards carried by the Westboro Baptist Church.

And for what it's worth, none of these arguments hold water if you're not predisposed to oppose homosexuality. /u/socketeer102, the answer I'd give to each of your examples would be to ask what is the good and what is the harm. I don't know any zoophiles or necrophiles. I do have LGBT people in my life though, and I've seen suffering where there was intolerance and joy where there is love, over and over again.

I confess that this has been a step toward understanding, but away from friendship. All the same, I'll continue to look for both. 




 I'd just like to say that as a non-Muslim, I'm watching this thread with interest. I would love to see some thoughtful, in-depth responses on this subject. 




 I haven't seen the 2002 version of *Solaris*, but the Tarkovsky film is truly great, and rivals *2001* in my opinion. There's a clear connection to *Interstellar* too in the way that both films address the limits of human knowledge, both scientifically and as subjective emotional beings.

 We sat together at one summer's end,

That beautiful mild woman, your close friend,

And you and I, and talked of poetry.

I said, 'A line will take us hours maybe;

Yet if it does not seem a moment's thought,

Our stitching and unstitching has been naught.

Better go down upon your marrow-bones

And scrub a kitchen pavement, or break stones

Like an old pauper, in all kinds of weather;

For to articulate sweet sounds together

Is to work harder than all these, and yet

Be thought an idler by the noisy set

Of bankers, schoolmasters, and clergymen

The martyrs call the world.'

. . . . . . . . . And thereupon

That beautiful mild woman for whose sake

There's many a one shall find out all heartache

On finding that her voice is sweet and low

Replied, 'To be born woman is to know-

Although they do not talk of it at school-

That we must labour to be beautiful.'

I said, 'It's certain there is no fine thing

Since Adam's fall but needs much labouring.

There have been lovers who thought love should be

So much compounded of high courtesy

That they would sigh and quote with learned looks

Precedents out of beautiful old books;

Yet now it seems an idle trade enough.'


We sat grown quiet at the name of love;

We saw the last embers of daylight die,

And in the trembling blue-green of the sky

A moon, worn as if it had been a shell

Washed by time's waters as they rose and fell

About the stars and broke in days and years.


I had a thought for no one's but your ears:

That you were beautiful, and that I strove

To love you in the old high way of love;

That it had all seemed happy, and yet we'd grown

As weary-hearted as that hollow moon.

 Well, yeah. See the literal millions of charismatic villains and anti-heroes in every narrative medium across human history.

You're probably more interested in *how* to make repellent characters likable though, which is a tougher question. For me, I think that the most liked "evil" characters have similar desires and motivations to us, but they lack those inhibitors that keep us moral. They're the devil on your shoulder, the id freed from the nuance of the ego.

In that sense, most compelling villains are ironically enough grounded in a relatable sense of righteousness. **Walter White (Breaking Bad)**: we all get sick of taking shit from people, he just pushes it to murder. **The Joker (Dark Knight)**: we all feel like there's something fucked in the regular social order, he just pushes it to anarchy. **Satan (Paradise Lost)**: we all want our freedom, he just pushes it to an unholy war against God Almighty. Villains have a good point, badly made.

The important balance, then, is in making sure the audience has more of a connection to the villain than his/her victims. I think there are two main ways to achieve this, without much middle ground: 1) you give him/her a story so sympathetic that the audience overlooks his/her faults, or 2) you make them so fucked up that their humanity catches the audience off guard and pulls their full focus--either way, the audience should feel that the villain reflects something in themselves. When you know **Professor Snape's (Harry Potter)** backstory, you'll forgive him any classroom tyrany; when **Jaime (Game of Thrones)** puts his life on the line for Brienne, it's such a shift that it upstages the child murder stuff.

**Tl;dr:** To whatever end you make them human, make it count.
