 anytime they talk about "game design"

Especially a few Sonic 06 episodes where they immediately stop being funny and entertaining to casually discuss Bioshock and then some other games and their design flaws 




 Oh yeah. I'd just love to hear Dan be funny and interesting and entertaining with Mark nearby saying stuff sometimes 




 They re-used this joke like 3 or 4 times in Sonic Boom alone! 




 it's above average. It has a good deal of flaws, but Heroes and Generations are the only good 3D Sonic games 









 what the fuck is a sonic? 




 That would be terrible. Go to your room 




 That happens with EVERY youtube channel 




 nooone else had a lucrative business with him 




   So something happened

like moving across the country? 




 The CHARACTER is meant to go fast, within the context of the plot. The game is different. There are only a few moments where just running is useful 




 That is AWESOME! Here, have an upvote 




 Except that his opposing opinions are clearly just contrarian. Like a hipster 




 If it were me, I wouldn't spend money so frivolously like he does. Game Grumps isn't something that will last and when it ends, it has the potential to take Starbomb down with it (which is where a huge chunk of their money REAALLY comes from) seeing as it's basically "Game Grumps: The Musical" 




 lol, yeah, that's what I was thinking. If the guy who hates OoT, but loves Speed Racer, and refuses to watch LOTR didn't think a movie was great, then it's probably one of the best movies of all time 




 That doesn't even make sense. So, you're allowed to hate story in games, unless you hate story in games.

Okay, good talk. Later 




 If you're a person that hates story in video-games, then your opinion on video-games is immediately irrelevant.  




 It's a business 




 damn, this is a cool subreddit! 




 Yeah, I was mainly looking for people's interpretations, but if Dan had ever said what they were about, I'd be interesting in hearing that too 




 have you seen the comments? 




 the people that will do this will not listen to you.

It also doesn't make sense 




 Anyone have any theories (or cold hard facts) on what each of the songs meanings are? 




 why are we analyzing something a fan made?

 not to mention there's still quality AND quantity.  




 no, it's weird. 




 Just as long as they're none of [THESE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22F7uqUmteA) then they'll do fine ;) 




 I don't understand the criticism of ANY of the movies. They all have the exact same strengths and flaws 




 What would you say has most propelled you into a successful career? 




 that was actually quite awesome. Keep making reviews :) 




 fuck it 




 I GOT COINS COMING OUT DA PUUUUUUSSYYYYYY!!! 




 It'd be easier to make a list of things they're NOT putting in Kevin 




 Do you think you're the first person to have this thought? 




 thanks for the chuckle :) 




 Fear? I can't fucking wait for **both** of the games they're playing now to end 




 Depends on who the people are. But I wouldn't pay for it 




 Yeah. Sling probably payed them to put the content on there for the exposure, since it seems to be a rather new service.  




 Their recording sessions vary. It can be anywhere from a few days before it airs to several weeks 




 If someone tries to rape you, YOU RAPE THEM RIGHT BACK!

It's the only way to stop them! 




 Check some recent conspiracy grumps posts. I saw it on there. It's titled like "Jon crashes Holly's stream" or something 




 Well, at this point you can just download the intro and outro sounds from other GG animations 




 what? 




 Someone that JUST did a bukkake scene minutes before and didn't have time to clean up 




 It's just not the same because it's funnier now 




 looks more like Ben Stiller 




 oh! neat! 




 It is to remain out of sight and silent 




 It's cum. Don't let them sugarcoat it. It's cum 




 I don't think Ninja Brian moved to L.A. He travels there a lot for NSP stuff, but I'm pretty sure he still lives in England. 




 Game Grumps would be able to sue him or he could sue them if one side broke the agreement.

Basically the same repercussions as breaking any other contract 




 This is old news 




 Non-disparagement clauses aren't commonplace in the traditional entertainment industry (they might be when you're affiliated with networks, but this is different than an NDA entirely) The Non-Disclosure Agreement would've been signed between Arin and Jon the moment they co-founded this business together. It's just common practice, especially in the entertainment industry.

And Polaris doesn't control any of their partners. Multichannel networks function more like agents/managers. They find better deals (such as brand deals, direct advertising, which means higher CPM rates) for a VERY small percentage of the profits. The only one with power in the relationship between content creator and MCN is the content creator 




 Polaris is just a multichannel network, they don't control either of them. NDA's don't usually expire and speaking ill of another person is not breaking a non-disclosure agreement (unless it is specifically written into the agreement) 




  Ross is one ripped dude who scrub lords should come on

fixed that for ya 




 That "you guys are good" was likely sarcasm. Also the NDA wouldn't prevent them from talking about Jon, it would prevent either party from discussing behind-the-scenes issues (which likely isn't something that would expire) 




 I'd watch the first few episodes, but I'd soon stop watching altogether. Jon never made me laugh on GG (despite his show being one of the best things on youtube)

Nevertheless, it'd be super interesting to see some new Jon episodes, or a new series where they play games with Jon via the internet (they did a good job of editing separate camera angles in GTA 5 and Guns of Icarus, so why they couldn't do this, IDK) 




 And **then** they KISS! 




 Well, they have to provide funny/entertaining conversation the entire time. That's a lot harder than you think and it's a lot different than being funny around your friends (hence why there are no other funny let's players out there) 




 Ew 




  it makes him harder to take seriously.

Why would you take a comedian seriously? 




 Just so people get the joke 




 Well, they aren't similar stylistically to NSP at all. FOTC is like a "folk band"

Danny said they inspired him because, like Tenacious D, this was one of the few comedy bands where the songs sounded great with or without the comedy.  









 Music is really hard to make and comedy music is exponentially harder. It's also not about dicks, though how I can see how people might think that, seeing as how there were like 4 or 5 dick jokes in the first album (totally reasonable!) 




 No. 




 Most people are also curious to see the two Not-So-Grumps play a game together (with or without Arin) 




 Or he could've changed his mind in general. A man can't be held accountable for everything he's said in the past. He's also said things like "Expect a Fireworks cover in February 2015" and "Weekly Updates on Jontron Content" 




 Yeah, definitely. Primarily because it wouldn't exist anymore 




 too scared of millions upon millions of views for a single video? (multiplied by the number of videos in the playthrough) 









 I'm starting to get the feeling that it's an art book from the little fairy. All drawn in crayon. Very cute. 




 :) neat  




 Yeah, probably 




 I'm with you there, man 




 They should do online co-op/multiplayer games with Jon 




 "I don't want to watch a Let's Play... fine! lol... these guys are pretty fucking funny" 




 It's a hell of a lot better than when Jon was on it 




 oh, do you have any tips for someone wanting to get big making comedy for youtube? 




 Is there a different energy/method of thinking when you're recording grump sessions? Kind of like how performing onstage changes people 




 Polaris has no control whatsoever with their clients. That's like saying "what if their accountant removed Jon?" 




 Barry didn't know how to edit until jon gave him a crash course. He had just graduated college at the time and needed a job 




 I think you're woefully underestimating what running a business is like. You also seem to think it's somehow easier if it's based around a youtube channel, video-games or both.

The amount of work that goes into simply managing taxes, income distribution, etc. is daunting alone. Sure we all want to be playing video-games for a living, but the truth is that's simply not what they do. They release a product to an audience (that involves them playing video-games) and they capitalize off of ad revenue and merchandise. (And it's been an intellectual property since day one. They both understood the importance of building a brand and selling yourself, they talked about it often) 




 There's a lot more to the job than just recording the episodes. Running a business is a full time job 




 Jon definitely wanted to monetize. Who would run a successful channel and work full-time hours in doing so without being paid? 




 youtube has been having issues lately. especially on mobile 




 They played Endless Ocean 1!? 

...BRB 




 Endless Ocean 2. It perfectly captures what Game Grumps is all about 




 Or it could just be a picture 




 Kingdom Hearts 




 Ladies and Gentlemen... we now present your commander in chief... Eminem's brother, "Emeniem!"

*applause* 




 Is it easy? 




 A monthly one would be awesome. It doesn't even have to be as long or the same people. Or even animation, it could be sped up editing footage or sped up anything 




 Anything with a plot (god-forbid a game have **that**) 




 Goddamn this fanbase is creepy 




 Like everyone said.

Arin got back into it for a while, till some creepy fucks went after Suzy with the Etsy "scandal"
