 Movies and books love to use the idea that ultra rare almost mythical text exist and are sought after by some super rich illuminate type collectors. Are there any actual cases of this? Books that pop up from time to time and biders go crazy over or we'll know text that are thought to be lost but rumored to still exist? 




 I always ment to make a playlist like this and this song sometime around midnight.( http://open.spotify.com/track/7Hn0bZgca6QFz6OyKkvAi6 )would be at the top of the list.  




 Living in a college town. After about 25 you reliZe all the people your age either move out of town or get married and settle down. On the plus side if you don't mind dating 18+ there is always a new batch every September.  









 I totally thought I was gonna open a r/justiceporn link. The fact that he's a bandit makes this so much easier to wach, 




 Got a circumcision at age 32.  




 In the movie Eter the Void and in ASAP rocky a video for LSD there is a super crazy looking lounge. I'm pretty sure it's in Tokyo but my research has turned up nil. Here are a few pics.

 The kill list, such a solid crime movie that takes this super WTF turn at the end. Super good worth the watch.

 When I get mad or irritated I roll my tongue under itself and bite down. Done it ever since I was a kid.   




 Working at a co-op grocery store or whole foods type store tend to draw the more hippy/hipster folk. Often, deep compassionate, sometimes misguided and naive but happy and a pleasure to be around for the most part.  




 Bucket list for sure. 



















 I'd  like more than a 10 song collection. I always thought that there should be records or tapes hidden through the world that you could collect, turn in, and they would be added to the playlist. 




 "Arcade shit" I'm gonna start using that. 




 This is so metal 




 Thank you, made my night. 




 Im waiting for one of the two kids to pipe up "dude that's me on the left in the photo, check it out here's the pick from my perspective." Reddit destiny and shit.

 I once woke up with a horrible foot cramp but was having a gout flair up at the same time so the pain from the gout made me unable to move my foot to uncramp it and it was this vicious cycle of cramp/gout pain for about ten minutes till it finally worked itself out. Fuck gout. 




 That's a legit question, maybe there is just so much porn on the Internet that given a chance for a random image the odds favor porn. Id like to see a ELI5 on this. 









 As a you young boy I saw The Cure, brad renfro and the young boy from Jurassic park, about two youths trying to find a cure to one of the boys HIV. I was not emotionally ready for that.

As an adult I had a friend recommend the boy in stripped pajamas, I put it on all willie nillie not knowing what I was getting into. Again I was not prepared. *sigh*  




 One of the greatest sets ever. Always been one of my favorites. Wish we could see her now. 




 All I'm getting is a blank index and no options to post. I've tried re-downloading the app but no luck. Any one else have/had issues?
 









 Shannon Figa. Oldie but goodie.
