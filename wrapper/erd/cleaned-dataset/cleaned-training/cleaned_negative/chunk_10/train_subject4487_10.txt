 I've seen it. 




 I have a theory that large traffic accidents in the winter time are due to poisonous government snow. 




 Sounds like someone needs to make a "SCAMMED by the US Mint!!!!" video. 




 APMEX routinely runs "special price" sales in their ebay store.  To find them, search for "special price" on their ebay store page. The results page is worth a bookmark.

You have paypal protection buying that way if you're really concerned. Otherwise, use your credit card for vendor-direct purchases, which gives you charge back protection, though you'll pay extra for it. 




 Let's run the math on a flat 25k contracts.

[One contract = 100 troy ounces](http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/precious/gold_contract_specifications.html)

25,000 contracts x 100 oz = 2,500,000 ozt.

[29,166.6667 ozt in one short ton](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+many+troy+ounces+in+a+ton ie=utf-8 oe=utf-8).

2,500,000 ozt / 29,166.6667 = **85.7 tons**

Is that right? Someone dumped 85 tons of gold? Is my math working out? 









  The cost to produce an ounce of gold, for example, is around $1200.

What's your source? 














 Yes. 














 Technically they're on top of each other. 




 Currently a nice deal.

 Yeah, the Libs are a no brainer, awesome score on those. The others I don't know much about (Kook doesn't seem like a deal to me).

 [JM Bullion has the 1.25 oz Bisons for $436](http://www.jmbullion.com/2015-1-25-oz-canadian-silver-bison-tube-20-coins/) (25 oz).  I'd rather have these due to mintage differences.  I picked up a tube @ $439 so put my $ where my mouth is.

Both are good, IMO, but gimme the Bisons.

The Bisons are on JMB's sale page, which changes every Monday so if you're a shopping for those, I'd be a buying this weekend.

  Yes, spot went down, but what happened to bullion prices (not much) and availability (it sold out.)

ASEs regularly "sell out" from the mint. [Change the date range at the top, just change the years going backwards](https://www.google.com/search?q=us+mint+sells+out+silver+eagles hl=en gl=us authuser=0 source=lnt tbs=cdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A1%2F1%2F2014%2Ccd_max%3A12%2F31%2F2014 tbm=nws).

 Anyone know why I don't see the ebay bucks logo in the phils auction page?  I signed up for this last month, I've got the "Welcome to eBay Bucks! Start earning now" email sitting in my ebay inbox, dated June 22.

I've not seen the ebay bucks logo at all. From the welcome mail it should appear below the auction price by the paypal and bill me later icons as well as any ebay bucks accumulations displaying in the left nav on my account/summary page.

 Well, it was up the tree when I shot it, so the math kind of works out. 




 They were blue and gold. No parachuters but they might have been checking out condos in the area. 




 I'm not sure, though I suppose they could have been in carpet bombing formation. 




 Nope, they were flying single-file about 500 feet, I'd guess, all with their landing gear down.  It was really exciting, 'Merica and all. I can barely contain myself. 




 Nope, still here, but the weekend has just started. 














 Why not MJ Bullion? Is Mike a pussy? 














 Construction. 



















  I just don't think it is likely to get a return in the long run

Why? Because it's specific to one dealer?  From what I remember, they have a mintage of 50k compared to 80k for the CML lunar privys?  Do you know of CML privy's that historically haven't appreciated well? They all seem to do pretty good from what I've seen.

I did grab some 10oz perth from BPM. 




 I'd be all over this if they had weight/fineness.  I pretty much stopped with the Pandas due to this. 



















 The only thing I've ever found under a tree was a dead cat.

 Any deals to be had on semi-numi stuff?

I just ordered some 10 oz bars to DCA (hit $14.85 spot) and I'm wondering if anyone has been looking around at semi-numi stuff?

I've been spying the 1.25 oz Bisons, [currently on sale at JMB, a tube for $436](http://www.jmbullion.com/on-sale/).

Also [Bullion Exchanges Einstein privy maples, but those are $547 a tube](http://bullionexchanges.com/roll-of-25-2015-1-oz-silver-canadian-maple-leaf-e-mc2-privy-reverse-proof-5-coin.html), would love to pick up a tube, but not much of a deal going on there...

 Shit, a couple bucks cheaper than JMB's Johnson Matthey bars.  Wanting to buy, waiting for price to hit $14.75, which sale will end first? Will I lose $2 per bar if I wait?

First world problems here, folks.

Thanks for posting this up, might hit at the end of the day. 




  If the dollar tanks the metals will tank too.

If the dollar tanks, PMs *should* go up as people will try to find another asset class. 









 I think he's talking generational like dog years...Silver hasn't been this low in two cocker spaniels. 




 Mas trabajo! 









 They've been on sale since this past Monday (this is when JMB updates their sales page).  I'm hoping we hit $14.75 as I'm looking to DCA with some 10 oz bars and they have the Johnson Matthey ones currently on sale.  It might hit today, looks like we went down to around $14.91 so far.

Why? 




 Only scanned it, but how does a 19-year-old afford a 2 month "internship" half way around the world?  In Hawaii, no less, where *everything* (except pineapples and coconuts) is more expensive. What sort of ROI could he expect to get out of those expenses (again, for a 2 month internship)? There's only one occurrence of "salary" in the article. 




 Not even responsive. 




 I've been to that fair, man, what a bunch of fucking hippies! They still doing the painted tits? 




 If it's any consolation, I was price comparing 10 oz bars a day or two ago and they had a handful that were marked delayed. Their 10 oz bar page looks pretty much the same now, i.e., a handful that are marked delayed. 



















 And platinum is currently $125 less than gold. Come on platinum CML deal. 




 Currently, gold is down .67%, silver is down 1.48%  according to my feed. 




 I'm looking to DCA via some 10 oz bars, watching to see if we hit around $14.75, I'd hit 40 oz, JM Bullion has some good prices on 10 oz RMC and Johnson Matthey.

Just picked up two 10 oz year of the goat via Bay Precious Metals @ $174 each. It's marked via a limited sale icon via their store listings which ends in a couple hours so if you're interested, I would not wait to buy. 




 I picked up a couple of these right at $180, they're nice.  They also have a 5 oz if you're looking to pair it up.

Edit: Just picked up two more at $174.00 each (spot looked to be $15.02 at the purchase time).  









 Where did you get the platinum CML? I'm looking for a deal on one of those. 




 Otisburg?...Otisburg???...Otisburg????? 














 RCM could totally nail this with milk spotting. 














 They've been selling that for a while. If you're really looking to pick it up, check back with them regularly. It's the lowest premium on a platinum coin I regularly see, though I'd personally rather have a platinum CML on a good deal. The "out of stock" may just be out of stock for this sale, again, I've seen the platypus in their store for a while.

They also have a 1 oz palladium CML.  It was $696 over this weekend, it's up to something like $721 when I was checking their current auctions earlier today. 














 I saw that this morning.

The Bison's are pretty much what APMEX was "special price" selling a tube of CMLs on ebay this weekend.  I'd rather have the Bison's, might have to hit a tube of those tonight.

The JM bars are a good price, too. They must be trying to blow those out as they were a deal last week.

Never been into the Arks myself.  




 http://www.apmex.com/product/78284/10-oz-silver-bar-geiger-security-line-series

This is about $3 more than [the cheapest/shipped generic 10 oz bar](http://www.jmbullion.com/10-oz-a-mark-silver-bar/) I can find doing a quick search. [Provident has one a buck cheaper](http://www.providentmetals.com/provident-metals-10-oz-silver-bar.html), but it's marked delayed so not in stock.

I think this might be the best price I've seen on these Geigers. 




 Rightfully so, I hope the police ticket those loiters. 




 The premium's are already ridiculous. 









 Two points:

A lot of front end *whatever* people nowadays *are* formal CS folks. This is the way front end has been moving so expect to see a lot more of this.

Most software "engineers" don't engineer anything, they build things.  The people who write the libraries and frameworks we use, those are typically engineers.  The people who use those libraries and frameworks are typically developers.  People like "engineer" in their job title because it makes them sound more important than they really are. See also "Senior".

At the end of the day, it's just a job title and doesn't matter. 




 What's the procedure when a passenger is carrying precious metals (gold/silver), be it government issued coins or privately minted bars? 




 It is getting nearly $800 million dollars from the feds for about 20 passenger rail improvement projects.

Amtrak has cost the government over $45 billion in subsidies over the last 44 years, allowing it to finance the upkeep of unprofitable routes, overstaffed trains, and the mismanagement of its food services.

Despite generous taxpayer subsidies, Amtrak has run operating losses every year since it began operating in 1971. Although these losses are declining, in 2014, the railroad reported what it described as a strong result, with an operating loss of only $227 million.

The operating loss is unlikely to continue to decline due to the losses in Amtraks long-distance routes, which bleed about $600 million annually. After factoring in depreciation and other expenses, Amtrak lost a total of $1.1 billion in 2014. 

Amtrak has had 44 years to become solvent without success.

 Yes, edited OP above for direct links. I imagine this will avoid the spam traps by now.

**EDIT** we seem to be in the spam trap so I guess I won't edit item #s to links in the future :) 




 Hey, thanks, but I'm hoping for about $50-100 less.  We're in literally a 4-year PM downtrend and markets might get interesting Monday due to some Greece action this weekend.  I'm patiently waiting on the sidelines, which hopefully will work towards my advantage. 




  I am kicking myself for not scooping up the ASE deals under $370 this past week.

They'll be back.  Premiums will be jacked until August when the mint resumes minting ASEs.

Decent deals. I'm in the market for the gold eagle (or buff), but I'm holding out hoping for better prices.

I also saw a 1oz palladium CML on Bay Precious Metals ebay if anyone is looking.  Don't know if it's a decent deal, just the first time I noticed them selling palladium.

Anyone know of any other deals this weekend? If so, please list them up.

 





























 Who wants to haul around a 50 pound coin? 




 Next up, try an [OPM kilo bar](http://i47.tinypic.com/2l3j9y.jpg).

 Yep, their tiered shipping sucks, but they have cool poured bars to couple these with, if anyone is looking. 




  Coins N' Things

[Today, Coins N Things is the largest seller of raw gold to the federal government. In the fiscal year that just ended, the U.S. Mint, which has bars made into coins for collectors and investors, bought $1.86 billion worth of the metal from the Bridgewater (Mass.) company.](http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/magazine/the-family-that-sells-gold-to-the-government-11032011.html) Article from November, 2011. 









 *[Goldco Precious Metals has been awarded exclusive rights to this limited-mintage coin](https://goldcopreciousmetals.com/silver-britannia-2015-privy-mark). Fewer than 200,000 of this investment grade coin will be made available for purchase.*

Never heard of them before and it looks like you have to call to order, so this is a nope for me. If anyone ends up calling, please post up the price for a tube. 




 They ship from Bridgewater, Massachusetts, which is outside Boston. 









 Goldmart used to sell items they didn't have in stock.  I'll never order from them again.  Same deal with Amagi.

Both are legit sites, but I refuse to support them.

 You should continue to buy in small amounts according to how much discretionary $ you have.

Don't sell the house and "back up the truck" and use all your $ in one massive purchase.  Buy 20, 40, or 60 ounces today...no big deal.  You're just cost averaging down.

Then wait and see if the paper price goes down into the 14's again and then buy another 20, 40, or whatever fits your budget. 

There's no right or wrong about it as long as you can handle whatever you have purchased in your budget and aren't going to be a fucking cry baby if the price drops a dollar :) 




 I will be doing another intro webinar On FRIDAY July 10th at 2 PM ET,

 Just because you own the property doesn't mean you have the mineral rights. 





























 I never got into these myself, but Bay Precious Metals on ebay has a handful of them for sale. I can't speak for the prices being good or not, I just know they have some.

 Batman is the best JavaScript framework!

There's also AngularJS which is similar to Ember.js but they have different names. Backbone and Cappuccino are similar in that they start only one letter apart from each other. Chaplin should get an honorary mention since we're in the C's. There is also EXT JS which literally shouts at you about how good it is, unlike Meteor and React, let alone SproutCore.  JavaScript MVC is near the top of the list as well because just by the name you know it's related to javascript.

But Batman is the best.
 




 You sound like you're more a front-end developer than full stack, in which case you can take this off the list:

* Backend libraries and frameworks

Everything else is appropriate.  It's literally a part time job (trying to ) keep up with front-end development. 




 They've been trying to sell that for a while. Do they post here? 




 As opposed to a live body? 




 At least they're not Beats by Dre. 




 I think you'd do OK with platinum but no idea bout palladium.  I asked a LCS about platinum and they currently buy. I didn't think to ask about palladium. You can just call around to your local LCS' to see if they're buyers. 














 [Cheapest I saw them today was at silver.com](http://www.silver.com/2015-1-oz-silver-american-eagles/), they're $18.35 now but spot is currently a tad over $15.  If you're still seeing them at $18.20 that's probably  the best you're gonna find. 




 Haven't seen the cat in weeks. Last time I saw him he was acting real funny, like he was drunk. Then he just wandered off, I guess. What's funny is it was right after that 100oz bar was delivered. 




 [Try the ice cube test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaYh3SlRK0w).

Also, if you have a cat, try hitting it on the head with the bar.  I can assure you cats do not like getting hit in the head with a silver bar.  If you don't believe me, try it multiple times.  Bottom line: If the cat doesn't like it, the bar is legit. 




 Indeed, always look forward to your daily recaps. 




 I'd be jumping out the window right now after that haircut, but luckily I'm in my basement. 




 [What do you think his username is here?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buSx1kaCA_k)

Some years have more relevant results than others. 




 Waiting to see what the rest of the week brings.

Had two small carts loaded up this morning around $14.78, was waiting for $14.50 to purchase but she never came.  I see JM Bullion sold out of the 10 oz RMC bars which was one of my carts.

Also watching for gold and platinum deals.  




 Pay extra every month. Every. Month. 




 I was waiting for $14.50, have two carts ready to go.  We've bounced back up to $15 at the moment and I think I'm going to see what the rest of the day/week brings. Should be interesting.

Buying what?

 It's a valid url (I was just there), though obviously having some dns issues now.
