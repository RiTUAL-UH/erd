 What is this feeling of the walls creeping in, the quiet noise of forever, and the different shades of black. To bow without achievement, to leave without ever being known. I can not disclose my identity in the interest of protecting what I write. 

Look to the stars and tell me how big you feel? Take notice of the dirt below your feet and describe to me your home. There is so much *life* for you outside of the shell you currently *possess*.  

Envision a boy that battles daily with imaginary monsters. Each day the monsters make the boy more frightened. The boy flees to the nearest forest. He carefully constructs a fort made of branches. The boy feels free of the imaginary monsters, but wolves own this forest. 

What came first God or Man?

I cannot disclose my identity because my existence has long since expired, I don't know how long it took the wolves to pick up the scent of the boy, and I've never met God, but look to the stars and tell me how big you feel? 




 When you're mathematically out. Last year I had a bunch of injuries. Literally made the playoffs on the last game of the season by losing (the other guy lost too and I had more total points) Had to play our league leader that was something like 21-2 and I basically just meat shielded him (Put random double starters in every slot I had) and somehow won. Then went on to win the championship which was my 2nd in a row #Whoo!  




 I'm a bit of a morbid but let this be a reminder to us all, death is coming. I only hope I can do great things while I'm here. 




 This was exactly what I wanted and scared the daylights out of me but thank you! 




 I miss Ultima Online quite immensely. I was one of those rare weirdos that was fairly good at PvP and RP. I have somewhat of an idea to mesh the two. I'm working quite a bit and don't really have knowledge of constructing a shard. Could you have someone construct a shard and have it up and running for around $500 or is that unrealistic? I know it varies on the scope of work to be done so this is just more general estimates to anyone who has ever paid to have some work done on their servers. 




 I can't fucking shuffle an artist, my music constantly disappears, and it's the first time in a while I feel Apple has released pure Batman Arkham type shit. I'm supposed to forget this because a couple of subreddits went private for a couple of hours!?! 




 I traded Sonny Gray for him a couple of weeks ago but it was right before he started getting hot. I agree with most of the responses on here, I would never part with him. 




 Surf it a few days before too, a lot of people will be trying to sell things quickly to make a purchase on Black Friday.  









 I hope you're just trolling. 




 I'm renting no roommates all bills paid for at $800 a month, right by the Lesner. Besides all it said is you may like that area, as in you rent over by North Hampton or rent along Indepdendence.  




 I'm a Realtor that lives along Shore Drive. As a 22 yearold you may really like that area. Pretty much the oceanfront without the tourists or tourist shops. If you want to send me a PM with your information, I'll give you a call. It's a great place to live.  




 Why didn't you start Brantley, Cruz, or Wacha?

How would you rate my trades? Would you recommend any areas I should look to improve? I'm trying to "regrow my farm" as far as pitchers because of all the trades. I'm thinking of trying to improve my reliever situation but I don't think I want to spend what it would take to get an elite reliever. I think the most I would trade would be Kazmir and I don't think the people holding the best relievers right now would go for that.  




 How do you go about that? I don't see a way to get around the price.  




 comment for updates 




 You can't pick up 6 of your own cards to seek validation for something you've already made! =) 




 Is the $20 bucks a month worth it? 




 I would pay. 




 Yeah I completely understand the idea that the best time to buy is whenever you're "ready," but I feel like 4K is pushing the advancement of GPU's faster and we're on the cusp of a large leap in hardware, similar to SSD's. I was tempted with the 980ti as well. Hopefully AMD's next GPU will be worth some of the hype and force Nvidia to quickly push something else out. I just want 60 FPS for 4K at around $500, then basically ride that out for 3-4 years before going SLI for another 3 or 4.  




 I sold my PC about 2 years ago and I've been itching to get another one. It's killing me because I feel like we're so close to 1 *affordable* GPU running 4k at 60 FPS, so I've been just patiently waiting... reading PC and hardware subreddits and crying.  




 I'll donate $15

Whats the purpose of shards anymore anyway. Each shard should just have different rules, and have like 10 shards. I know this option is currently impossible because people would lose properties etc so take this as more of a rant.  




 Well he doesn't hit any balls over the fence. 




 The trick for me is if you miss a Monday or you just don't feel like going on a Monday or a Tuesday etc because you won't be able to get a full workout in etc, just go the following day or force yourself through a day you don't want to be there. I can't tell you how many lazy weeks have started on Wednesday but I still continued the rest of the week instead of starting a bad habit.

Also this is a little more difficult but I have a few friends I go to the gym with. It varies daily but it helps keep me motivated if I'm having one of those above mentioned "off" days where I'm not feeling it. 




 I've been holding him on my non-dynasty team but it's getting old..., if SS wasn't my weakest position I would probably had ditched him already. 




 Not sure but if you keep giving amazing tips I'll follow you to whatever  subreddit you like. 




 Really going to down vote? It wasn't Vietnam or some other controversial war, it's fucking WW2.  




 Your great uncle is a hero. 




 Never used or heard of Robin Hood. Zero commissions, where's the shitty part of this story. Truthfully I just watched their intro video and that was it. 




 I just did a trade that was centered around Hamels (3 other players also included) for Kershaw the day before the Braves outing, I feel awesome...  




 Not bad at all but my problem is I want to style my hair like that without all the height. Still enjoyed the video, good job.  




 Hey I just wanted to say incredible job!! 




 He was also always ready to pull out a bouquet of flowers from behind his back.  




 THIS IS AWESOME!!!!!
