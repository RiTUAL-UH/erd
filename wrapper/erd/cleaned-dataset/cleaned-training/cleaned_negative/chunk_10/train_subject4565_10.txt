 To be fair, there's a spoiler warning just before he gets into them. If it is a steaming pile, then does it really matter? 




 Context: MovieBob used to review for The Escapist, home to game critic legend Yahtzee (Zero Punctuation) and former home to game critic Jim Sterling of The Jimquisition.    
    
Oh my god...I thought the trailers were good, but this was *well* under the reception I expected. I can't wait for the rest of the reviews to pile on. 









 S02E11 - Escape from L.A. In which BoJack [spoilers](/s "finds Charlotte has had a family in Santa Fe (not Maine) for many years, takes her daughter to her prom, encourages her, her friend and *her* date to leave early, recreates his favourite memory of Charlotte with the daughter, ditches the friend suffering from alcohol poisoning off with the date at the hospital, encourages the date to lie to the authorities, tries to seduce Charlotte and when that doesn't work, basically lets Charlotte's daughter seduce *him*.")    
    
This season went to a really dark place.

 *Suck a dick, dumbshits!* 




 Track 14, ["The Ecstasy of Gold" - Ennio Morricone](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOr0na6mKJQ). Probably my favourite piece of music of all time. 




 I was really hoping for some kind of Lost parody or something, a poster in the background somewhere, featuring ***this*** Matthew Fox as Jack. 




 "Bear" in sexual terms has several meanings. One is a promiscuous pot-bellied, hairy, horny man (that in some definitions can be gay). She's tasted bear before, because "her step-dad was a bear". 




 OR it was something actors are given so that they understand their motivations and attitude more. That often happens so that an actor knows how to play their character, especially when there isn't any information to draw from the material about a character's backstory. 




 Princess Carolyn called BoJack "BoJ" in the premiere. How would you pronounce that backwards, and who plays both of those characters? 




 Not to forget "My step-father was a bear." This was also a kinda gross play on words. 




 "We could have David Copperfield make the World Trade Center disappear!"    
"Um...I hate to be the one to tell you this..." Here you think he's going to tell her about 9/11, but instead he says, "...but David Copperfield isn't really a big draw anymore." 




 I'm so sorry, Stephen Tobolowsky. 




 To be fair, from what I've heard, Psylocke's ethnicity is pretty complicated (having the mind of Captain Britain's entirely White sister and the body of an Asian warrior). And this new Jubilee is much more obviously Asian than she was in the cartoon, so we have that. 




 And here's the [official IMAX channel upload](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64qIYyPWksk). 




 Didn't think about it at first because the article gives a warning before it gets into it, but I guess I definitely should flair it. 









 Siddig    
    
You mean [*Siddig El Tahir El Fadil El Siddig Abderrahman Mohammed Ahmed Abdel Karim El Mahdi*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Siddig)? 




 **YOU ARE A PROPHET** 




 Looks a bit more like Michael Cera than I remember. 




 @issacbranflakes    
    
Niiiiiice. 




 You know how I got past this? I started reading the books. The show doesn't do as good a job setting the characters or stakes up as the books do. I never really felt connected to the characters when I watched it, but now I've nearly finished Book 2 and I kinda love it. Being inside the characters' heads makes it much easier to invest in and understand the gratuity. There's a lot of backstory the show pretty much ignores or makes confusing, but with the books, it's all laid out. 




 Fletcher will go down as a classic movie villain. 




 [She Will Be Loved](https://youtu.be/nIjVuRTm-dc) - Maroon 5    
I think. 




 [Icky Thump](https://youtu.be/1OjTspCqvk8) by The White Stripes, if anyone was wondering. Great song. 




 Terry O'Quinn as John Locke. So glad he won an Emmy for it. 




 I'd definitely replace Expos and Recon with Stranger in a Strange Land and Across the Sea. Ewww. 




 Season 1 - Walkabout, Deus Ex Machina, Do No Harm    
Season 2 - The Long Con, Two for the Road, ?    
Season 3 - Flashes Before Your Eyes, The Man from Tallahassee, The Brig    
Season 4 (not much to choose from) - The Economist, The Constant, Ji Yeon    
Season 5 - The Life and Death of Jeremy Bentham, Namaste, Some Like It Hoth    
Season 6 - Recon, Ab Aeterno, Happily Ever After 




 Either, I'd have to believe. 




 Or *All Five Books/Seasons*. 




 **I HAVE TO GO NOW. MY PLANET NEEDS ME.**    
*note: jane died on her way back home* 




 Not racist. Being from the area where Africa and the Middle East meet, you could definitely get away with it. 




 I was expecting more. Rogue's powers hadn't evolved. There were no Rogue action scenes like we were hoping. She was only there because she needed something to do in the original script, and they had reshot her out for the initial cut for good purpose.    
I'm sorry, but wtf was with that random sex scene? I can't believe Beast would be that naive. Why did we care that Cerebro was rekt, again?    
The original cut had something missing, but this one proved that what was missing was left out for a reason. I'm glad I saw it, but it's nothing special. Lightly disappointed. 




 Should've listened to Maester Aemon and killed the boy, Jon. /r/fuckolly 




 If you're using your phone, tablet or iPod then you can rotate it around spherically as you watch, through the YouTube app. 




 until the series is finished    
    
In approximately how many decades? /s 




 Arya goes back to Westeros, marries the Frey kid then totes mcgotes kills all of the Freys.    
/optimism 




 Lol, [reminds me of something recent!](https://twitter.com/hamishandandy/status/619407269898289152) 




 What is it? 




 Starring Cliff Curtis as "Not Maori".    
Looks awesome though. 




 Given my username, you can tell I've never cared for Zombies /s 




 Well, it's a valid opinion. I don't agree with it, but there's an argument to be made. No need to insult anyone. 




 Big win for /r/kitharingtonwatch right here. 




 Kristian actually gave Ultron a 4.1 IIRC 




 To be fair, she's only been *offered* the role. It's not a done deal, and there are absolutely no reports on whether she's considered it. 




 The name High Cards sounds like a shitty straight-to-DVD stoner comedy about poker. 




 But he wasn't a "big name actor". 




 Exactly, and /u/Vandelay_Latex_Sales was referring to the former:    
big name actors 




 It's all ogre now. 




 For me, it's usually **"COME ON!"** 




 RDJ was a known star, most people were aware of Johannson, everyone knew of Natalie Portman, but Hemsworth, Evans, Pratt, Renner, Ruffalo, Olsen and Taylor-Johnson were *not* recognisable names to most people. It was the other bankable actors in the films in supporting roles, plus the franchise, that lent the series legitimacy.    
EDIT: Yes, they did have solid careers, but they weren't particulary recognisable big name actors. That's what /u/Vanderlay_Latex_Sales was trying to say. 




 NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!! 




 Well it was out for a full week in many countries before its US opening weekend. Might have helped. 




 tfw night's king is the real santa 




 What did it say? 




 It's been fully confirmed fake now. 




 IMO they should have easily been able to fit Just in there. What a pathetic oversight. 




 I mean, Jai Courtney was miscast as Kyle Reese, and Jason Clarke wasn't that believable a John Connor, but I thought it was a pretty fun movie despite the weird plot conveniences. 




 Hijacking second-top post to make sure people know this is (**EDIT: VERY LIKELY**) a fake teaser. Also, the Deadline report is from November (in case anyone doesn't check) 




 ALL HOT MUST PIE- wait, that doesn't work. 




 True, only Jaime. 




 The Mad Queen. She's going to burn that place to the fucking ground. 




 ["Weird Fishes"](http://youtube.com/watch?v=V_Ydoe4Q-Gg) - Radiohead. The way the guitars sound like one, head off in different directions, then transcend our dimension: mind-blowing. 




 Joel and Nathan Drake are pretty skilled mass murderers, so they'd both fit in here too. 




 He supported it because he's friends with Arnold IRL.    
    
(edit: wrong abbrv) 




 Emilia Clarke is way hotter with her natural hair colour.    
And Jai Courtenay is a boring Kyle Reese. Totally miscast. 




 I listened to several TV podcasts at the height of my podcast days, but mostly **LOST**-themed ones like Jay and Jack. Now, I guess the /Filmcast kinda counts, as they talk about TV shows half-and-half with movies in the portion leading up to their movie reviews. 




 Or Joffrey's, if the theories are to be believed. 




 Why would the peaceful Richard agree to purging DHARMA in 1992? He's such a righteous dude. Did he just have to go along with it because Ben and Charles wanted to? 




 I just call him Keith. That's how memorable he is. 




 What a coincidence! Yeah, [S5](#s "his sparrows (including Lancel Lannister) arrested Loras for the crime of buggery"), so he's supposed to be anti-gay, although I'm pretty sure it's different in the books. 




 First film: **OOGA CHAKA OOGA OOGA**    
Second film: **BOY TOY NAME TROY USED TO LIVE IN DETROIT** 




 Huh. For me it was instant. He's introduced as Aeron Greyjoy, "Damphair" is introduced as his nickname, and it's really damp out there. Just clicked. 




 The entire opening montage being absent is what clued me onto checking. Everything past that, not sure. 




 Gay marriage was legalised throughout the US, IIRC (I'm a Kiwi, not an American), and this guy is supposed to be homophobic in the TV series (I've heard differently about the novels). I don't think it's supposed to be a homophobic post, just a joke about the character. 




 It's just a phallus, seeeeeee?! 




 DAMFAIR, PEE-TIRE, JENDRY

 His first chapter and a half were dreadfully dull, but after the Asha reveal there's just this funny air about the everything else in it. Listening to him feeling insecure while everyone else has fun was hilarious. Asha is described as this cute badass chick, his uncles are cool and he's just completely intimidated. It really gets to him. I loved it. 




 Jon not coming back is absolute blasphemy    
    
That's exactly what they meant. 




 Game of Thrones' score has significantly improved since the early seasons, which I thought had a pretty bland score. True Detective has a great *soundtrack*.    
Also, [your example sent me on a nostalgia trip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_btA1bS53w). 




 Don't talk trash about St. Tyrion! 




 The polar bear one is hilarious when it's a genuine complaint.  




 Okay, so it must just be certain territories where it's in two shortened parts. Thanks. Hope you enjoyed it! 




 Just know if you watched it on Netflix in two parts, you're missing more than 10 minutes. Seek out the 105 minute broadcast cut! 




 So you're saying that I have to get shafted to realise I was shafted?    
    
Kinda, yeah. There's a lot about this show that's worth watching. I definitely didn't call *you* pathetic, just the assumption you and many others have made - I worded that badly (and it made me sound like I was trying to insult you, which I wasn't. sorry). What I meant was that there's a lot of circlejerk over how Lost was or wasn't total disappointment, and then there's valid reasoning about whether it was or wasn't a disappointment. From your comment, you seem to assume that those who circlejerk over how *utterly offensive* the overall outcome and big picture of the show was, are correct. I never felt shafted, and plenty of people didn't. Season 1 was almost entirely character-centric, and expecting answers at the end of that kind of premiere season is, ya know, still valid, but nothing to be offended over. The show answers all of those questions in time, though with varying *relevance*. The relevance of those answers led some viewers to believe that certain answers weren't there, when they totally were - they were just pretty anticlimactic (in almost universally agreeable terms). This only speaks to several of the mysteries. And, like I said, they were not dead the whole time. Many people who even watched the show misinterpreted the ending. They all believe they were shafted and shout it from the rooftops. From hearing what aspects of the show you valued more, I can see you being disappointed in the ending, but you can never know. That's why I don't agree with you. 




 ...holy shit, I missed that anecdote! 




 [Lost spoilers](#s "They weren't dead the whole time.")    
    
edit - fixed tags 




 The reason I love LOST is because the awesome journey and extensive interesting and often heartbreaking character backstory and development made the ultimately pretty fucking silly destination feel worthwhile, because the characters got the ending they deserved. Yeah, it doesn't always feel "complete" and "all tied together" by the end if you look back to episodes like "Special" and "Dave" which try to make a big deal about things that ended up being irrelevant. There are plenty episodes that feel frustrating on rewatch because of this. However, I don't blame the show for that. Every series has its shortcomings (I love BrBa and GoT, but they certainly have their hits and misses). These are my favourite TV characters of all time. LOST accomplished so many spectacular things, and to completely overlook its achievements just to be salty about it missing small details, *especially if you only watched 24 episodes (/u/horsenbuggy)*, is a bit pathetic.    
I've heard fantastic arguments why the show is an ultimate disappointment, and I agree with many of their points, but...you can't assume one argument is right when you haven't seen the majority of what they're talking about. 




 I just spent ages reading that. Fucking hilarious. 




 You've certainly got a valid reason for disliking it. [Here's the interview where Lindelof recounts what Cuse told him about meeting GRRM](http://youtu.be/NzRjHDAgRmk?t=1572). Of course, Lindelof has always been salty about the backlash, so he may be stretching the truth. 




 Not a fan of the on-island ending? I didn't mind it. I mean, the show gets silly very quickly. There's a massive turning point in season 4 where it goes from still semi-realistic to completely batshit insane, and they resolve that specific cliffhanger in season 5 with an answer which was even more batshit insane. It was around that point where they dropped flashbacks for good (except for the occasional episode) as a means for characterisation. That's where it dropped most of the viewers. I'd say if you missed any episodes before you watched the finale, you haven't given it a fair chance. As for the ending, it was just as silly as everything else had become on the show. That's kinda what I like about it - they committed to the lunacy they'd built up to. 




 Nope. 




 That's what people say, mmm mmm. 




 Apparently when Carlton Cuse approached GRRM about why he didn't like the ending, GRRM said "I didn't like the fact that *they were dead the whole time*". GRRM didn't get the ending. I wonder if he would have liked it more if he understood it. 




 Maybe he did think they meant the scripts. Victoria did screw a couple of things up, like parts of discussing him being dissatisfied with Mr. Eko's death. 




 It's a reference to a time when some politician got a flan thrown in her face, apparently. 




 Oooooooooooooooooooooh, deary me... 




 Pizzolato and Fukunaga don't get along well anymore, which is why Fukunaga didn't return for True Detective S2 :( 




 He's directed some of the best TV episodes I've ever seen - ["Through the Looking Glass"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9ybaLbpQ-4), ["Live Together, Die Alone"](https://youtu.be/s4LvBV1GbtM?t=121), ["Happily Ever After"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65T-xl24W4E), and the classic [Walkabout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYfKHVdmjzQ). (these links contain **MASSIVE Lost spoilers**)    
I couldn't be more stoked. 




 You could say the song is...**too old**. 




 Don't you dare, don't you dare, don't you dare, don't you dare, don't you dare, don't you dare, don't you dare, don't you dare, don't you dare, don't you dare, don't you dare, don't you dare, don't you dare, don't you dare, don't you dare, don't you dare, don't you dare, don't you dare, don't you dare, don't you dare, don't you dare, don't you dare, don't you dare, don't you dare, don't you dare, don't you dare, don't you dare, don't you dare, don't you dare, don't you dare, don't you dare, don't you dare, don't you dare, don't you dare, don't you dare, don't you dare, don't you dare, don't you dare, don't you dare, don't you dare, don't you dare, don't you dare, don't you dare, don't you dare, don't you dare, don't you dare, don't you dare, don't you dare, don't you dare, don't you dare, don't you dare, don't you dare, don't you dare, don't you dare, don't you dare, don't you dare, don't you flan in the face. 




 *rubs head* 




 (Pilot does not mean premiere. A pilot is a proof-of-concept episode given to the network before a show is green-lit for series. Most shows use their pilots as their Season 1 premiere episode because of how expensive they were to shoot. Almost all of the footage from GoT's pilot episode was discarded, as was with the pilot for Sherlock.)
