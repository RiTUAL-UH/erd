 haha! i wish i had more seinfeld gifs i could use to reply. there goes my weekend. thanks. 




 one of my favorites, too. I also made [this](http://i.imgur.com/ObIUV8L.gif), thought you might like it. 




 this was your tournament entry, right? congrats on the win! 




 ha! the corpsing from this and the Elaine/frank 'you wanna piece of me' scene are my fav outtakes from the show

 I only use ps now to make the final gif. With your steps and the guides above i think i can ditch it and go back to ffmpeg/convert for that last step. 




 this is very cool  
the latest version of convert/imagemagick has been equal to PS in terms of quality, but the file size is about 25% larger. not a big deal. did you try any of the steps listed [here?](http://redd.it/3cy6nd)
