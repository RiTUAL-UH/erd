 they don't have to release information regarding their policies

I'm sure a fast-growing private equity buyout firm like BC Partners will mind their legal P Qs. But here the issue isn't whether it's legal to do it, but whether it's fair.

 the manager positions I mentioned are now off the career guide on the website.

You might also want to see if they are still visible through [the Internet Archive WayBack Machine](http://archive.org/web/) and if so take screenshots. At this point, I'd say document everything and figure out later which pieces are important.

 [Here's a video interview with the managing partner of BC Partners about his plans for PetSmart](http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2015/04/09/bc-partners-raymond-svider-on-buyouts-debt-and-his-affinity-for-cats/). 




 The union you want to talk with is probably United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW), the largest union for retail workers. I don't want to discourage anybody from joining a union, but it's not easy and this company is already so far along in restructuring that you may not be able to do anything to stop it.

A recognized union, with a contract, only works when it formalizes already existing unity among the workers. For PetSmart to reach the point of recognition and contract would be a many year long process, necessarily involving thousands of workers, that could only get started if the UFCW believed it had a good possibility of success ... and right now, UFCW has other and bigger companies in their sights.

HOWEVER: the changes you describe may well create a situation in which there could be enough unity among the workers in your particular shop to get some concessions even without a contract. Go talk to the organizing director of your regional UFCW office, and don't be shy. You don't have a lot to lose by doing so. And if several workers go together to management and announce their intention to form a union, you may even get additional protection from retaliation under the National Labor Relations Act.

You can and should double check anything I said here with your state AFL-CIO before acting on it. I *was* a national union staff organizer, but that was years ago and my recollection may be rusty. Good luck! 




 Huh? That's the *archive*. What's the issue? 




 This article is *four months old* -- in terms of what's been happening here recently, that's a lifetime -- and it was a big part of the external pressure that led to the admins' change of policy.

So I'm a little confused about why it shows up here now, long after it appeared on 15 other subreddits and was quoted or cited in numerous press reports about reddit. OP?

 Where? How much?

 




 Speaking of technical issues, can you address [this thread?](https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/3dz6n3/do_not_forget_to_find_a_july_29th_event_and/cta84f4) 




   people are scheduling it for the wrong time.

I don't think "people" are doing this, at least not actively. There's a common problem with scheduling software that sets the default at 12 noon unless the organizer sets it for another time -- which experienced users would know to do because most of the uses for such software are for individual, time variable events. But it becomes a problem when a lot of new folks are using the system to set up gatherings at a fixed time, because many assume the software will do that for them.

In any case, you can't possibly repeat your caution too often! 




  That's a weird URL by the way.

Which one, and why? 




 That study was in 2014. The most recent available estimate for the total voting age population in the US was [237,657,645 in 2012.](https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2012/01/26/2012-1635/estimates-of-the-voting-age-population-for-2011) If the turnout is 40% (what Pew was expecting in 2014,not necessarily what happened), the approximate size of the Party of Non-Voters was then 60% of the total, or 142,594,587 individuals who need a reason to bother voting at all.

Of course those numbers are very rough, but the scale of it should provoke some hard thinking around here. To advance the campaign, much less win the nomination, will require refocusing from arguing with people who already read the news and vote to those who have everything to gain by voting (esp. for Bernie) but don't believe it yet.

And *that's* why face-to-face organizing matters. 




 OMG, I accidentally transposed two letters! That typo obviously means I'm an idiot. 




 So ... you got "volunteered" in your absence? 




 They're going to keep adopting and mistreating animals until someone convinces them to do better. Simply stopping them from getting this particular kitten, or taking it later, won't work. I think you have to do the more difficult task of sitting down with them and talking about your concerns, without precipitating bad feelings. 

And remember, even adults can grow up more, and maybe they have or are starting to do so. In this case, it's a good sign that they went to a shelter that vets the cat and requires an interview and fee -- many people would have just grabbed the nearest "free kittens" ad on Craiglist. Try to build on that: "You obviously care enough to select a healthy kitten and make sure it's medically protected. Do you need any info or help with raising it?" is the gist of the message, although I'm sure you can find better words. Speak to their better selves, give them a chance to do the right thing, and keep advocating if you see signs of trouble. If his parents are also your mate's parents (am I reading this right?) maybe they can also help.

Just don't assume, even with the evidence you cite, that this can't work. Help them make it work. 




 So where's the Sanders vote going to come from? The only place it could come from in order for him to win: Existing Hillary supporters.

This is the failure of imagination that informs all of the Beltway press skepticism about Sanders. In reality, the largest block of potential supporters is what the Pew Research Center, using methodology far superior to that used here, identified as [The Party of Non-Voters](http://www.people-press.org/2014/10/31/the-party-of-nonvoters-2/). This group could be the clear margin of victory *if they can be organized and mobilized* in  the next year. 

This 2014 study by Pew is so important that all Sanders supporters should read it and think deeply about what it will take to get these folks to believe it's worthwhile to vote at all. Fortunately, I'm willing to bet that many members of The Party of Nonvoters hang out on reddit.

The one sector of Clinton's base that is problematic for Sanders is her strong support among African-Americans, which may well prove to be unmovable.  




 ... and those short shorts with tall white socks! 




 Well, we do have a small lawn (in a bigger, non-lawn yard). Still: how do such rates compare to what it would cost if the cost were set by hourly wage rather than by the job? I can't see paying someone more for a half hour than most workers make in an hour.   




 Good point: just mowing. He's careful about edges, though. 




 Really! I pay an adult $15 to do ours. For $40, I'm tempted to do the OP's lawn myself. 




  If everyone that smoked weed signed the petition, this would be on the ballot.

Yes, because nobody who smokes pot has any critical thinking skills and would just automatically sign for anything that mentioned legalization. It's not like there has been a widespread campaign to discredit RO, or anything.

I prefer to call it mockery.

You can call it whatever you want. It won't change what it is.
 




 Well, for pandering ~~demagogeury~~ demagoguery, that was pretty impressive. 

EDIT: fixed typo 




 If no one here has a specific suggestion, you could ask at a nearby church or synagogue. The minister/rabbi will surely know of some reliable teenager in the congregation who will do it.  




  So it looks to me like a bunch of sanctimonious, pretentious leftists/progressives are the reason this was shot down.

This is not your conclusion, it was your premise -- and it's laughably wrong. Aside from not grasping how the political process worked here, your notion of who smokes is a baseless stereotype. Because you don't smoke, you have no idea how many lawyers, lawmakers, doctors, successful business owners, soldiers, soccer moms and other upright citizens smoke pot.

As for whose moral compass is broken, I'm happy to set my identity and record on this site alongside yours for comparison. I've never [set up a subreddit dedicated to hate](https://www.reddit.com/r/HamplanetHateMail/comments/31v2ko/i_started_a_subreddit_with_this_title_about_a/), let alone routinely used the word "retard" to disparage commenters who disagree.

 Try for a *foster* home, while the search for a permanent home continues. Perhaps a relative, friend or neighbor of your mom's would be willing to do this; at least this pool of people should have someone in it who can help you place the cats so you can concentrate on your mom.  




 Even if it were what the OP thought he was linking to, it would still be a ridiculous post. This focus on attempting to micromanage headlines, for better or worse ("let's not put Trump in the same headline as Bernie") reveals a complete lack of understanding about how campaigns (and news orgs) work.

 This is the best course. When you visit to check on them, there are two things you can do that will help them get good homes eventually: take a lot of pictures, and get them used to being touched.

 Well, stop the presses.

Why does this merit a post? 




 If Sanders gets the nomination, sure. Before then, not a chance. 




 The problem is that it's still, for a campaign, necessarily contested terrain. New users don't know and can't easily find out about alternative subs to discuss the general issue, and so go to the obviously named "gateway" subreddit.  




 Lazy to nonexistent moderating is the likely cause. I refuse to read Yahoonews, but that's the classic mistake made by newspapers in their own comment sections, and it's why [they're choosing now to eliminate them.](https://www.google.com/search?q=newpaper+comment+sections ie=utf-8 oe=utf-8#q=newspaper+comment+sections)

 [It's worth noting that there are far more postings of this article on various subreddits than show up the "other discussions" tab here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/duplicates/3dzrl4/men_who_harass_women_online_are_quite_literally/)  




  middle-class raised males who display minor hostilities towards anonymous women 

That's not who I was talking about -- and if that's who you were talking about, perhaps you're taking this rather too personally.



 




  raising awareness does precisely nothing to cure cancer other than take money that should be going to research... the funds raised at these events hardly ever actually make it to research

You may know a lot about cancer (or maybe not) but you clearly don't know much about fundraising, and your assertions are absurd. 




 Read more about domestic terrorism by hard rightwingers and miscellaneous spree shooters. What I stated about them is not remotely controversial among researchers and LEOs.  And although I wasn't talking about them, it's hardly a stretch to assert that these findings will prove useful in dealing with ISIS-recruited young American men given what we know about them.

Adding, we all "know" a lot of things about social psychology, but it takes studies producing consistent results over time to change norms and policies. It's not like the money for this even *could* be redirected, even if we were dealing with a zero sum budget, which we're not here.

 




 Exactly right, as I learned the hard way. Siphotrol does it all in one afternoon. But it really isn't necessary until your ankles are getting as many flea bites as the cats are. 




  Are people seriously funding research into "losers" who harass women?

You should take another look at the dominant pattern of lone wolf domestic terrorism in the US over the past three decades. Anger at losing control over or being unable to connect with women is the single most obvious recurring element aside from access to weapons. I'd be happy if results from this study *only* helped with this one issue -- and there are a lot for other benefits to learning what makes such men tick. 




 Wise move. That's one smart cat you have there! 




 I can't decide whether that's adorable or terrifying. If that's possible, what's to stop them from "borrowing" the car?

Step back and examine your assumptions, please. 




 As much as the money raised on the day, these events are about developing donor relations. Having participants sign up supporters is an effective way of outsourcing the process of finding new donors, and every step of the preparation and follow-up ties all those people closer together and closer to the cause. 




 Have you used the search function to find other discussions of this? It comes up fairly often. There may also be something about it in the reddit Guide to Columbus (sidebar). If there *isn't* such a thread linked in the reddit Guide, you could do everybody a favor by adding whatever you find to that wiki.

EDIT: [here's one discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Columbus/comments/269e7k/best_places_to_go_star_gazing_in_or_around/)

 Are you a registered voter? That's often the bottom line. Voting for a long period from the same address also bumps you up the list. 









 ... and you just helped make things worse with that nasty, uninformed post about "stoners" being responsible for RO's petition failure. Why not try to improve the tone,rather than complaining about it and adding to it? 




 This analysis is assbackwards: Responsible Ohio's petition is failing because voters who support legalization have *succeeded* in organizing against this particular initiative, convincing others to not sign even to put it on the ballot because of the monopolistic structure of the proposed "reform". RO has so little support that they are having to use almost exclusively paid circulators, whose valid signature rate is laughable and probably won't get any better in the next 10 days.

We're all going to have to wait for something better, and it doesn't help that the competing "grassroots" initiative seems completely incapable of leading anything (for reasons that have nothing to do with being stoned).  




 I like you.  




 Caution: the "flea bombs" sold in most stores are a waste of money.

The best treatment for the whole house is NOT sold at the pet store, but at the vet's office, because this is what they use: Siphotrol Plus II Premise Spray. It's the nuclear bomb of flea treatments: works instantly and for months afterwards. But it's not to be used lightly -- if you're not being bitten, it's not time for this stuff yet. If you do have to use it, follow the directions to the letter ... and then relax, because the problem will be over for the year.   




 Congrats on providing a great life for Max. I think you've just significantly raised the bar on kitty birthday cakes! 




 I hope you're taking lots of pics at every stage, especially the pointy-tailed moment and the (later) jumping sideways stiff-legged stage. Those photos can make all the difference in finding homes for kittens. 




 It's a hard discipline. I still have the last four I tried to foster, eight years ago, so now I'm not allowed to even look at live kittens. When we go to PetSmart, I've asked my husband to make sure I stick to the main aisle and to stop me if I veer toward the adoption center. That's why I spend so much time looking at other people's kittens on reddit (usually with one or another grown cats plastered to my side).

 "The economy" can, should and will eventually be reorganized to value people before profit.  




 Maybe the answer is to create room in your budget by getting assistance with *other* necessary costs. Are you receiving Food Assistance? If not, it's very likely you're eligible, and this can make a huge difference. [The Ohio Benefits Bank](http://www.ohiobenefits.org/) can sit you down with a social worker who will assess your whole financial situation and show you what [programs are available to help you stay afloat and healthy](http://www.ohiobenefits.org/programs.php#health-healthystart). 




 I like this answer better than the real one.  




 Your general point is well taken, but if you mean the mural that literally says "Olde Town East", the sticker isn't ON the mural but on a traffic light switch box next to it.  




 Do you want all the comforts of home plus extras, or silence and solitude? 




 Capitalism. The same system that includes big, rich companies *and* a propaganda culture that promotes unrealistic expectations about entrepreneurship, mostly based on the notion that it's desirable to cut expenses at the expense of the very people who make profit possible. There are millions of businesses that are functionally under-capitalized and always will be, but their deserved demise is delayed by widespread acceptance of an unsustainable definition of value.

And that's all I have for now, because I have to go pick up my brilliant sweetie from his criminally underpaid job.

 




 I don't understand why you didn't answer my question.

Okay, then: yes. 

I'm referring to a whole system, not one business. I have sympathy for the employees tasked with enforcing the current definition of value by trying to hire people for far less than the true social value of their work, but that's not going to stop me from pointing out that the entire concept is distorted in a system that overvalues individual acquisition of wealth over social responsibility.

Managers who can't hire for this reason are being set up to fail by the people who set "the company budget". 




 In addition to listening to BLM, Bernie needs a reorientation on how to present his views on the relationship between race and class. His analysis is correct that eliminating wealth inequality is a necessary precondition to eliminating race and gender inequality. But simply making that assertion is insufficient, especially in a culture so divided by the history of slavery and the grotesque distortions of identity politics over the past 30 years. He has to be able to explain in plain English *why* that is the case.

Adding, the BLM folks were not attacking Bernie. They were trying to get the attention of a major conference of mostly white progressives -- and the national press there to cover Bernie. I don't know what panels NN15 did on racism or police accountability, but I do know they would never have been mentioned by the press if this hadn't happened. Sometimes, being formally "on the agenda" or even on the stage isn't enough. Sometimes, a little strategic rudeness is needed to reboot assumptions.   




 Who's setting the "value"? What if the current definition is not only wrongheaded, but massively unjust? 




 No particular suggestion better than those already posted, just a big THANK YOU FOR READING BOOKS!

 best customer service

Sure as hell ain't Best Buy. And both Lowes and Home Depot are structured in such a way that any appliance repair service is probably from the manufacturer rather than the mall-type retailer. (I'm sure someone will correct this if I'm wrong.) 

I've always bought from Sears because their Kenmore appliances are extremely durable and their prices (especially at the Outlet Stores) are easily the best. The installers are another story, and I would recommend having someone else do that if you can. 

But I must say that the last time an installer screwed up, on an AC window unit, my complaint to customer service resulted in them *setting aside for review and then losing the entire purchase record* for that and the $800 refrigerator purchased at the same time, with the result that I got both for free. Never underestimate the power of clerks who don't get paid enough to hassle. 




 True. That second comment was below my set display level and I didn't see it until you prompted my to go back and find out what you were referring to. 




  It's amazing how much good we can do for others just by being a little vulnerable.

Amen! There's persuasive evidence across many cultures that an unwillingness to admit vulnerability is the ultimate weakness, because it effectively cuts an individual off from from the healing power of community. Conventional gender roles have placed most of the pressure to hide self-doubt and sadness on men, but it hurts everybody because we all lose the gifts of the ones who remain silent too long. 




 You might want to go re-read your own comment history. You've spent a lot of time lately telling people they're stupid and wrong. Any competent shrink (let alone mature common sense) will testify that when you think you're the only smart one in the room, the problem isn't other people. I sincerely wish for you a moment of rigorous introspection, followed by asking for the help you so obviously need. 




 Torties are the best. I can't imagine how you could ever have thought they were ugly, but I'm impressed with your strategy for helping these supposedly under-appreciated kitties -- and I'm not at all surprised that they won you over!

They're all decorative items produced for the mass market starting in the 1950s. "The Circle of Friends" may reference earlier, less commercial art, but don't be fooled by its pseudo-rustic appearance or the fact that some hippies may have bought it. It's from a time when decorative art in the US was all about appropriating themes from Other Cultures and adding exotic backstories. I'd bet that most people who bought early versions of it rightly expected that their friends would be wowed by their selection of a supposedly ancient and unique "artwork".

 .np = Non Participation. When you link to a post from another reddit, you're supposed to change the "www" to "np" in order to prevent brigading or just distortion of the vote balance because of input from people who aren't subscribed. If you vote or comment in an .np thread, you risk being banned by that sub's mods, or even shadowbanned by admins. This is a good thing, because it shores up the ability of subs to become communities based on the participation of people who actually care about it, rather than being disrupted by careless or hostile input.   




 Thanks for adding that! 




 /u/keltric is correct. Mark it solved. 




 Okay, thanks. I remember that Rez Rat moment; I just didn't realize the main motivator for creating /r/IndianCountry was the /r/NativeAmerican mod's refusal to act. 

It's such a shame when an obviously-named gateway sub -- the one with the name newbies will look for -- becomes useless because of bad modding. /r/politics is the one that makes me white-hot angry on a regular basis, not because it's dominated by one political viewpoint but because the mods have decided that the definition of "politics" includes only news about elected officials and candidates. They remove anything about advocacy groups, coverage of government agencies, major cultural developments that have political implications, etc. In that case, too, there are several alternative subs, but so far none has emerged as the consensus relocation site for an all-sided consideration of politics. 

Thanks again for the explanation. I have been lazy about where I post Native news, but I'll now work harder to make sure /r/IndianCountry is at least the *first* place I put things. 




  I just realized this conversation was taking place on /r/NativeAmerican instead of /r/IndianCountryso no point in reporting crazy racist stuff.

 So true, and so sad. What will it take to turn this sub around? 




 His submission history is still visible, and it seems he has some serious doubts about things like whether humans have been to the moon ... 




   It could happen.

It *does* happen, all the time, and seeing scapegoating as a major dynamic in politics clarifies a lot of what's happening now. [Here's a helpful analysis](http://www.politicalresearch.org/1995/02/05/the-snake-oil-of-scapegoating/#sthash.8MtBqC6G.dpbs) of how this plays out, especially in America.   




 At the time, at all levels of government, radical protesters were considered un-American at best, traitors at worst. Calling in the National Guard was not uncommon, and the practice only came into question when they [killed four white college students](http://dept.kent.edu/sociology/lewis/lewihen.htm). 




 Do you know where she was living at the time? 




 Aside from basic human decency, one reason is that bad food in prisons is a leading cause of prison riots, in which guards (who presumably get more empathy from the likes of you) get killed. 




 Nope. It's something reporters *aspire to*. 




 Depends on your experience, I guess. I love it because it reminds me of my grandmother, who had both a tree and a great recipe for black walnut bread that she shipped to all the grandkids every Christmas. So I pick them up and sniff them when I see them, and that transports me to a happier time. 




 Thank you! An hour later, there's no sign of further blood, and she's busy complaining about which flavor of Fancy Feast we gave her tonight. But when it happened, at 11:30 PM on a Friday, it was really scary.

BTW, I recognize you as a mod and want to say I really appreciate the work you all do here. I suspect I'm not alone in subscribing just to learn from your answers to concerns I haven't (yet) had to face with my own animals. It's a great service you provide!  




 When I moved to the southern US, I was terrified of unconsciously mimicking the regional accent. For trying not to sound like a jerk, my reward was being treated worse, because everybody said I was obviously a New Yorker. The joke is that I had moved there from Ohio.  




 I always plan time to go shopping when I get to the city nearest the step-off. 

And to make it all easier, I like to ship my equipment and most clothing ahead, so there's no chance of it becoming lost baggage. 




 What was the riddle? 




 ...except it's not true. Please read the link provided by /u/shitlord_prime ITT. 









 go away, idiot spammer.

reported.

again. 




 Not sure why you think this isn't an average pun thread, but it's a good one. I wish this happened more often -- it used to happen all over reddit, but now seems contained in /r/pics. I don't subscribe to that, so thanks for posting it here.

BTW, that's not an Italian song. It was written in 1952 by [American songwriters Harry Warren and Jack Brooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/That%27s_Amore) for the Dean Martin/Jerry Lewis film *The Caddy*.  




 Thanks. Another user also clarified this below. You can see how I got confused! 




 Species: Feline

Age: 20 years

Sex/Neuter status: F/S

Breed: DSH

Body weight: 5.6 lb.

History: CKD Stage 3

Clinical signs: bleeding at SQ injection site

Duration: three minutes until stop

Your general location: Ohio

Our elder kitty has been diagnosed with stage 3 kidney disease, and has been on daily fluids for almost a year. She's doing remarkably well, staying active, eating well and accepting the ritual of being injected. But tonight blood started coming out of the injection site as soon as we finished. It was enough to freak us out, but apparently stopped after soaking just two facial  tissues. Did we do something wrong? Is she in trouble (she seems even more perky than usual today, coming and going)? Is her skin just losing elasticity, or what? I can call the vet in the morning, but any answer now would help us sleep tonight. 




 Does Tigs always wear a onesie, or is there a medical reason? 




 Thanks for clarifying that! Personally, I think one should always dress up to the max when rescuing kittens, but for me that just means a clean t-shirt, not a heavy coat ... 




 Tell me about it: I just dislocated a knee for what must be the 20th time, and realized this time will not be the same quick recovery I got used to in my 20s. The psychological aspects of getting older are fine by me, but the physical changes are a literal pain. 




 This is an important number, because it's what really matters in determining wages -- unlike the "index to inflation" which is much less. But dammit, if they're going to squeeze more work out of us in the same number of hours, it shouldn't be workers who absorb the difference.  




 Ouch! Hope you got lots of sympathy mileage out of it.

 




 I've always heard it as "turned out" meaning the firefighters are wearing their [turnout gear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunker_gear#Turnout_clothing). 




 I think OP meant "turned out", as in dressed in [turnout gear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunker_gear#Turnout_clothing). 




 Yep: cats can go all boneless when it suits them!  




 Well, if he winds up going to jail and somebody makes a movie about it, I hear former presidential candidate John Edwards might be available to star in it. (Seriously: I can't be the only one who sees that "separated at birth" aspect ...?) 




  that is going to set him back 150k

Your overall point is valid, but nobody on either side of a bill like that seriously expects it to be paid at face value. It will be drastically reduced through negotiation, and much of the remainder will be absorbed by the hospital. 

 




 Kitty has a strange notion of what "fit" means ... 




 When I die, I want to come back as a book shop cat. That's the life!

Lilly is gorgeous, and this is an excellent portrait of her. Thanks for sharing this beauty with us.  




 Thank you so much for this post! I just spent the time since you posted reading around the Justice Project and Open Communities websites, and I am totally inspired. I sent the link to my sister, a lifelong social justice activist who just moved to Winnetka and will be delighted to find these folks. What a great group!

Adding, you might be interested to look at [this project](http://www.comfest.com/purpose.php), which is not nearly as ambitious but has been plugging along, gathering fans and changing social norms, since 1972. 




 Wow: what an auto-fill fail. "Being Moody" is the name of the column and has nothing to do with the content of this piece. Much more relevant (and more likely to get readers to click the link) is that this is a report from the Netroots Nation conference. 




 That's already happening. I'm still hoping for a paradigm shift such that elders could spend their last years with their families (whether birth families or created collectives). Nursing homes, no matter how good, are a barrier to inter-generational respect and understanding.  




 Thanks! 




 Okay, thanks. I did get an answer from admin mail about my original question, and thus am now satisfied that admins can, in fact, see private/closed reddits. 




 Is the user I was talking to an admin?  




  when I get the chance, I do spread the word

The more people who do this, the fewer sad stories there will be about failed shelters. I don't know about other areas, but in Ohio there's a steady drumbeat of news stories about small rescue orgs getting overwhelmed and ending up dumping their charges into municipal kill shelters. So yes, let's spread the word! 




  next to the username 

I'm sorry to be obtuse, but whose username? I'm looking at a private reddit that I created, and don't see anything like that, whether logged in as myself or another account. Do you mean, if I find my way to a closed reddit for which I'm *not* a mod that "turn admin on" will be next to *my* username?  




 I may have oversold that idea. My parents had such a tree, and talked about someday harvesting it, but when they died the last thing on anybody's mind was dealing with a tree. Now, looking it up, [there are many reasons why an urban tree wouldn't be tempting to a lumber company.](http://ohioline.osu.edu/for-fact/0044.html) Sorry to dash your hopes! 




  re-authenticate

Que? 




 Point taken. Let's say, instead, *people of faith*. 




 Can we send you out to preach this to the rest of reddit? You're so right about the awesome stories -- we all have so much to learn from our elders, and the reflexive dismissal of older people's opinions is such a terrible waste. Elders are exactly the people who have *earned the right* to rant, even when they're nutty. We need to learn to understand that, too.  




 Thank you so much for posting this. It's such a disservice to people who do rescue and such work when people choose to make an imgur gif without linking to the video. I pitched a fit at/u/Gallowboob about this last week, because he's such a frequent offender, and he pointed out that redditors are more likely to click on an imgur link than a YouTube link. I get that, but:

**Everybody, please include the link to the full video in the comments when you post an edited gif about rescue work.** These folks deserve support!  




 Linked above ITT. 




 Looks *exactly* like a Black Walnut. OP, here's how to tell: do you hands look stained and have a strong smell after handling the nut? Is the ground underneath the tree inhospitable to other plants? That's a Black Walnut.

If you own the tree, do what you can to make sure it grows straight. The wood from this tree can be very valuable, but only if it grows straight enough to cut into lumber. 




 Eww -- not *at the table*, man. Wait until you get home. 




 Amen!

This is the fastest growing and often the most effective sector of the progressive movement (think Moral Mondays), yet it remains invisible to many young activists who have swallowed the New Atheism koolade. There's a lot to learn here, not just a audience ripe for recruiting. 




 "*interesting*"?!?

This guy deserves a taste of his own medicine. I bet he has some *interesting* stuff in his own closet. 




 Is IBM now a prison? [That's where the problem is.](http://www.10tv.com/content/stories/2014/07/15/columbus-ohio-maggots-in-food-among-new-ohio-prison-complaints.html) 

Aramark has different tiers of service -- from National Park hotels to schools to prisons -- and the ones near the top are qualitatively better.  




  To my knowledge there aren't any really active private subreddits that are about hate.

Source of this "knowledge"? 




  stupid fucks off reddit

Gee, thanks. Being a vet tech -- even in a rescue hospital -- doesn't give you license to act like a jerk. 

For others who may be tempted to take this dismissal at face value, I would advise taking this user's absolute dismissal with a grain or ten of salt. Refeeding syndrome is rarely seen in vet offices except in cases of hepatic lipidosis, precisely because veterinary care costs money and the cats that come in are more likely than not to have had basically good care. In rescue work and shelters it's another story, and the caution is *always* warranted when talking to someone who just found a starving kitten and knows nothing about cats. 




 It looks like you're right -- and just what this area *doesn't* need is one more threat to sycamore trees, dammit. 




 at the worst I think maybe two nights should acclimate most everyone. 

That's optimal for 7K. I try to convince people to give themselves at least 24 hrs. before starting down, but even that's a tough sell for people who don't recognize the issue. I'm glad you and your co-hikers have had no trouble, but I'm usually talking to unprepared/overeager newbies, and over the past 3 decades I've seen a lot of them felled by "mysterious" ailments that were actually predictable and preventable consequences of elevation change. And hiking with individuals who ignored the advice is not pleasant, so I keep pushing it.


  




  I'd appreciate it if you could link me to some convincing evidence supporting your claim, as I am interested, especially if they've been covering it up.

I can't because this all came out in a series of posts over a couple of years to the Grand Canyon Hikers and Backpackers Yahoo group, which is great day to day but not very searchable. The one person who knows the most (because he's an MD who practiced at the Canyon) has been effectively silenced by threats of a defamation suit. But it's something to keep in mind.

Anyway, thank you for this post. You may have saved somebody's life, and certainly saved some folks' vacations.

 




 (1) You've done more than enough for now. Be patient.

(2) Please tell us you got the cats out of the house when you bombed it. 

(3) If the problem is severe or widespread (i.e., fleas are biting *you*), the product that will end it completely is the stuff vet offices use: Siphotrol Plus II Premise Spray. You *should* buy this from a vet, so they can explain exactly how to use it. It's the nuclear bomb of flea eradication and should be handled with care.

 




 You forgot one thing: they're mostly coming from sea level states to rim elevations of 7,000 feet or more, with no idea they need time to acclimate. Blinding headaches, fatigue and fear are the usual result. 




 [I think you'll appreciate this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/grandcanyon/comments/34y44e/this_is_why_we_dont_hike_grand_canyon_in_the/cqz4icv) 




 You should know that a good number of experienced GC hikers have concluded that such water delivery systems are actually dangerous because they encourage the hiker to sip *too much* water, leading to the danger of hyponatremia. The manufacturer you cite is extremely aggressive about legal bullying to stop dissemination of that analysis, but after one experience of hyponatremia, I'll never stop pointing this out.

BTW, it would be a mitzvah if you would amend your original post to emphasize the danger of water intoxication and urge hikers to carry very salty snacks and use V-8 in place of energy drinks. 




 Hyponatremia -- also known as water intoxication -- is a huge, under-appreciated issue for desert hikers. Following the advice in the original post here could get you in serious trouble, because it does not address salt loss.

You're absolutely right about V-8 being the best re-hydrating drink. It has *all* the electrolytes you need, unlike sports drinks. After one experience with hyponatremia (that even a concerned Ranger didn't recognize as such) I started carrying a can of V-8 for every day in the Canyon. It's worth the weight! 




 Now that you've survived it, you'll probably enjoy [Over the Edge: Death in Grand Canyon](http://azdailysun.com/news/local/canyon-deaths-and-counting/article_ba588a05-e816-55be-87f6-80f15b76f744.html), the book every new GC hiker should read before stepping off. 




 I don't even begin to know what to say about this -- but don't miss the note at the bottom about the name of the realty company. 









 Also, isn't following a suspect out into the parking lot moving into another jurisdiction? The parking lot is owned by the mall, not the store. 




 I ... I just couldn't help myself. It was such a tantalizing subject. I blame all that late night TV for wearing down my commitment to FWC. Or maybe it was my parents' fault. Certainly not mine, anyway. Please don't ban me! 




 Just did that.

EDIT: actually, I just messaged the admins. What you  linked is an archive, not a contact. 




 I was going to ask why schadenfreude -- but your user history makes it clear: one of these jerks was your teacher. 




 That doesn't answer my question. My understanding (from many years ago) was that the *content* of private reddits is invisible to  the admins, although they could see the fact that such reddits existed. I never knew whether it was a technical matter or a policy decision, and it may have been a myth to begin with. But it will take a definitive answer from an admin to convince me either way.
