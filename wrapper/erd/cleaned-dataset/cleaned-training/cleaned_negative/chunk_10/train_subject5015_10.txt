 I'm curious if you think that one day children will be taught that the PKI was not solely responsible for the 'revolution', and that the people killed weren't all communists? 




 Thought you meant /r/destiny for a second.

 Well you can click on the link in my last comment, then click the 'edit' button just below the comment and just copy and paste the story in. (the story being here: http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/3aypkl/update_surprised_my_boyfriend_with_a_ps4_for_his/) 




 You could always edit the story into this comment: http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/3aydou/update_surprised_my_boyfriend_with_a_ps4_for_his/csh53n2 it seems pretty high up with a good number of upvotes. Also no need to be sorry! I remember reddit being confusing for me too when I first started. 




 Its listed in your user account page - http://www.reddit.com/user/RandomnessXo 

best idea would probably be to make a comment here with the story, as there is no way to add the story text into a link post. 




 looks like your first post was deleted, heres a link to it: http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/3aypkl/update_surprised_my_boyfriend_with_a_ps4_for_his/ 




 TIL, thanks Mr Irani

 I wasn't talking about the tweets, I specifically said comments because I meant the comments on the article, the most liked of which talks about race culture and Blair's 'labour government'. http://gyazo.com/7b8791a9050585d904fb622d1d21ada9 




 I admit I did misinterpret the article, only because I didn't actually read the tweets, maybe you can see how the article coupled with it's comments makes it seem serious. I'll take out the part in my comment about the article being serious.

On the subject of the 'comments', I wasn't talking about the tweets. It's extremely obvious to anyone that understands a laughing emoticon that they find it funny, and if I had actually read them and seen checked their names against the authors then I wouldn't have said that the article was taking it seriously.

What I was talking about: http://gyazo.com/7b8791a9050585d904fb622d1d21ada9 The very first and most liked of the article comments is about race culture and Blair's 'so called labour government.

Please dude, take a chill pill next time and scroll down the page a little more. Maybe re read someones post and the article they're talking about before calling them an idiot. 




 yo landon cool name bro but you're on the wrong subreddit - /r/destinythegame 




 The article seems to take the video serious (although it doesn't actually)...and the comments are absolutely hilarious. It seems like they all read the title and watched 5 seconds of the video before going on a rant about race culture and british politics. They can't even use the excuse that they're Americans misunderstanding British humour. 




 Genuinely curious, why wouldn't NowSecure contact samsung beforehand and let them fix the bug before publishing this?

 You get that ending if you're too controlling of Ciri, no sidequest, its literally the end of the game. 




 Nugo what!?! 




 hey you got upvoted now, bet you feel silly

 It seems like the majority of these are just common sense. For example, in Germany, you shouldnt stare or make the Nazi Salute....really? The implication being that it's alright to do this in other countries?

 Well I didn't see that ending but i'm guessing it means she stopped it and then came back, in mine i'm just thinking she stopped it and didn't come back to Geralt. 




 I think it worked. Good job, you finally killed it. We will now hail you as our lord and savior. 




 + mirror of his banning spree on subs for doing nothing: https://sendvid.com/ewe9he02 




 That's awesome. Do you have the link to the original one? 




 The Crone also said she would kill Geralt, which she didn't. Crone's were wrong about a lot of things. I doubt they thought they would all be killed by Geralt/Ciri, or that  Geralt would betray them and release the children (what I did). 

Also if you also look in the quest log for the final quest it say something to the effect of "well as for Geralt, that's another story.". Dandelion also dosen't say anything about Yen,Triss, etc (at least in my ending), he only speaks of the political situation. I don't think that's really implying anything.

I'm not saying he didn't kill himself, it's definitely possible. I just think CDPR wanted it to be open to interpretation. 




 Yeah sounds about right, I think I did only two of those 5 things.  Cheers 




 If you're talking about the Crone ending where he gets back Vessimirs medallion, we don't know if he commited suicide. 




 To be honest we don't know if either happened (which is actually worse, I think.) We assume Ciri died, but in another ending she survived stopping the frost. And I guess Geralt could have gotten up and killed all those monsters (pretty easily actually). 




 Yeah definately. I chose not to kill Radavid which of course affected the political landscape. And actually I did see the lodge discussion, but I assume thats because I went in with her. In the flashback you see her standing behind me, a bit displeased, with me talking to the lodge. 




 Sounds like a better ending than mine.

Ciri goes into a portal created by the Elven mage, crosses into another world and then walks into the White Frost, she has some flashbacks of Geralt and her (now that i think about these were all from the last 'chapter', like me giving her the necklace instead of burning down the laboratory, i assume all these event flashbacks are the ones that caused this specific ending). Then the Frost in Geralts world stops, so I assume she stopped it successfully. Don't know if she escaped it like she did in another ending or what.

After this Geralt goes to the Crone's house, kills the remaining Crone and gets Vesimirs wolf medallion. He then kneels inside the house, clutching the medallion. You see a ton of monsters approaching the house, and then it fades to black. No idea if he was sad enough to let them kill him or what. 




 Yeah it was the ending with the Crone...don't know if CDPR ran out of time or if maybe it's meant to imply in some weird way that Geralt feels extremely lonely and that his and the other characters fate dosen't matter.....that's stretching pretty far but it's the only thing I can come up with lol. 




 Yeah good points, do we know how far away their planet was from the ice age? 

In my ending, we get to know a bit about the political situation, but I can't really say I care about that that much. In terms of the characters, the *only* thing we know is that Geralt and Ciri may or may have not died. No idea what happened to any of the other characters. Was really let down. 




 It seems really lazy. I can't imagine why they wouldn't tell us what happened to her or the other characters. 




 Nope and that sucks. 




 Geralt goes back to Crookbag Bog to get back Ciri's medallion which one of the Crones stole. In the end he kills the Crone and ends up kneeling in the house, clutching the medallion while tons of monsters approach the house. Fade out. Don't know if he or Ciri died. 




 Why would she not tell him? 




 Yeah I don't even know what happened to Ciri. Pretty much a given that she died, though. And even Geralt, last we know in my ending he was just sitting in the Crone's house, clutching Ciri's medallion, with tons of monsters approaching. Don't even know if he let them kill him or if he killed them and got out. 




 Got the ending where she sacrifices herself to stop the Frost. Can't believe I don't get to know how the other characters reacted and what happened to them....wondering if this is just a CDPR fuck up (maybe they ran out of time like suggested below?) or if there's something im missing? On the other hand, I feel like this is one of the morally 'better' endings, as Ciri is saving an entire planet.

Also, did anyone find the boss fight with Eredin/Other Wild Hunt General really really easy? Like each one of his hits only took away about 1/20th of my healthbar, and each of my Quen signs absorbed two of his hits. I'm 99% sure even the wild hunt dogs were doing more damage to me.

I was using full master ursine armor/sword, specc'd mostly into the red skill tree, at around lvl34.

I just can't imagine why they wouldn't tell us what happened to the other characters (in this and other endings). 




 What the fuck. So different to Ciri dying...how the hell do you go from her sacrificng herself to her becoming empress......lol. 




 Also got this ending and felt the same way, would really like to know what happened to the other characters. 




 yeah i thought the same with how geralt acted....guess those peasents  were just insulting me 




 They state a couple of times in witcher 3 that witchers are emotionless, is Geralt the exception the rule? How else can he 'love' Yen? 




 Fortunately it was run by an organization that just wants to aid discussion on international issues, not by some Bond villian.

  For superior do you mean just north of the crossroads inn? And mastercrafted is the shattered tower on Skellige on or Vellen?... Also I found enhanced in Skellige isles, at least part 1, still searching for part 2, cant remember where now. 




 No stash box but there's a mod already out to increase weight limit to 9999 (its on the sub). 




 is there any way we can edit this ourselves to set the weight limit? just change an integer or something (lol)? 




 For someone with so much money he sure does have a shitty website design. 




 Those are all completely different games. With different engines, different amount of calculations running in the background, different gameplay goals, different core mechanics, different art styles etc etc etc. Not to mention GTA had a 265$million budget and their game still takes 5 minutes to load into multiplayer, compared to DayZ which was a free mod (initially) and is the most tense gameplay experience i've ever had.. Saying shit like that makes it sound like you have no idea what you're talking about OR like you're baiting. 




 bB! 




 Glad to see you replied to my points rationally and showed you aren't a child...wait a minute. 




 I mean we know it's improv..anyone thats ever been on the show or been in the audience confirms that. The music also could have been added in post, or they just know that at a certain point they 'start' the mission and are ready to start playing the music. No need to throw insults now just because someone has a differing opinion, that's just childish. 




 Can you expand? The music in that scene is just on a loop... 




 It's all improv. It's worth noting though that for 30 minutes of footage it takes like 2-3 hours of filming, so the viewer only sees the best scenes/jokes. 









 Cool. 




 This book has never been more relevant: http://www.amazon.com/Conquered-Clippy-Erotic-Digital-Desires-ebook/dp/B00UJ01WBW 

Yes, that's an erotica involving Clippy. 




 Can someone explain exactly how she fought him off? Did she have pepper spray or something? Looks like he just gave up. 




 I have never seen this picture before, along with all the other people who upvoted it. Even the rediquette says not to complain about reposts. These comments are complete shit because people are ignoring that.

edit: Rediquette also says not to downvote just because you disagree with someone...seeing a pattern anyone? 




 I'd hope a professor at one of the best universities in the UK would account correlation =/= causation when saying something like this.

 What you mention definitely takes away from the main game being so polished, something to take into account.
