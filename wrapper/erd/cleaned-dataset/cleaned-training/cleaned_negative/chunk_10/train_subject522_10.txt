 The Guardian's best 1000 novels of all time.  They seem to have collated a lot pf existing lists so most of the old regulars appear.

It's an odd mix.  

I've only read two books based on this list's recommendations - The Poisoned Chocolates Case and The Wimbledon Poisoner and was very underwhelmed by both.  Anyone see any gems on the list?

Edited to include link to list - thought I had. 




 The Guardian has a good list here http://gu.com/p/46t37/sbl
