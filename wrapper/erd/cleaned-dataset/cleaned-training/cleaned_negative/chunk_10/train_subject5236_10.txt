 Saw it while I was in. E6 and an E4 get caught stealing ammunition and selling it. E6 dropped to E5 and good to carry about his career, while the E4 went to E1 and was kicked out of the army.

 Ive traveled. I know what different Islamic cultures are like. Thanks but no thanks on the read. I was just giving my opinion on the hijab. You can keep your hijab. I don't give two flying shits. While you're at it just where two. Or three. Knock yourself out.

 what type of winter coat you wearing? 




 turn it around
