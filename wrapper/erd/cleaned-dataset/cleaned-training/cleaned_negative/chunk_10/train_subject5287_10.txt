 The audio on your xbone is not set up right then ...took me an hour to figure this out too... 




 I'm not sure actually...I just noticed this while playing through the campaign...there are so many games where I end a chapter or mission in the middle of it and then when I come back to it...sometimes i forgot what happened in the last chapter lol... but to answer your question...maybe??? :-P ...I did just notice that when exiting a chapter in the middle of it instead of the beginning...lets say after you have completed one fight...when I played it again instead of getting the same fighter ...I ended up having a different opponent.  




 :D
