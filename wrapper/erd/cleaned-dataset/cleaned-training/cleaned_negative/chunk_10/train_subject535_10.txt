A follow-up study covering 9,284 of the above mentioned patients showed that 41% had recovered or were greatly improved while 28% were minimally improved, 25% showed no change, 2% had become worse and 4% had died.

 The P85D is only about 3-5mph faster in the quarter then the P85S despite having more torque and horsepower.

 it would still have no problems doing a quarter mile in less than 10 seconds.
  
  
I really don't think this car will easily get under 10sec through the quarter mile, gear starts to become a huge issue for electric cars as you gain in speed. 
  

 




 My guess is similar to the new Model S, with maybe a tenth saved off in 0-60 rush and .5 sec shaved off in the quarter. I'd be shocked if the car can pull more then 125mph in the quarter mile and do well on a track unless Tesla invest a lot into cooling. 
  
Frankly I'd be impressed if the car can run comparable to a 911 turbo on a track, and I'm confident that it will be far off future hyper cars that will be out by then.

[Here is a very simple graph on suicides in India.](http://i.imgur.com/FovwdC0.png) 
  
  
[The largest comprehensive review on the data failed to find sufficient evidence that GMO bt-cotton was a major contributing factor to suicides of Indian farmers.](http://www.ifpri.org/publication/bt-cotton-and-farmer-suicides-india) 
  
We first show that there is no evidence in available data of a resurgence of farmer suicides in India in the last five years. Second, we find that Bt cotton technology has been very effective overall in India. However, the context in which Bt cotton was introduced has generated disappointing results in some particular districts and seasons. Third, our analysis clearly shows that Bt cotton is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for the occurrence of farmer suicides. In contrast, many other factors have likely played a prominent role. Nevertheless, in specific regions and years, where Bt cotton may have indirectly contributed to farmer indebtedness, leading to suicides, its failure was mainly the result of the context or environment in which it was planted.  


[Here is the 2011 Version](http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/jds/2011/00000047/00000002/art00007)

The analysis reveals considerable variation in trends in suicide rates across the nine cotton-growing states. The data, although not ideal, and the modeling do not, however, support the claim that GM cotton has led to an increase in farmer suicide rates: if anything the reverse is true.
The Indian farmer suicide story has become received wisdom for some anti-GM
campaigners. In fact, we find that the suicide rate for male Indian farmers is slightly lower
than the non-farmer rate. And Indian suicide rates as a whole, although contested, do not
appear to be notably high in a world context. The pattern of changes in suicide rates over
the last 15 years is consistent with a beneficial effect of Bt cotton for India as a whole
albeit perhaps not in every cotton-growing state.

  
  
Overall in terms of increase yields and decreased pesticide use Bt-cotton has been a significant plus to farmers in India. 
   




 No it doesn't. Your link is not looking at cancer risk from smoking weed. 
  
Our primary finding provides initial longitudinal evidence that cannabis use might elevate the risk of lung cancer. In light of the widespread use of marijuana, especially among adolescents and young adults, our study provides important data for informing the risk-benefit calculus of marijuana smoking in medical, public-health, and drug-policy settings.

  
-[Source](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23846283)
  

  There were 79 cases of lung cancer and 324 controls. The risk of lung cancer increased 8% (95% CI 2% to 15%) for each joint-year of cannabis smoking, after adjustment for confounding variables including cigarette smoking, and 7% (95% CI 5% to 9%) for each pack-year of cigarette smoking, after adjustment for confounding variables including cannabis smoking. The highest tertile of cannabis use was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer RR=5.7 (95% CI 1.5 to 21.6), after adjustment for confounding variables including cigarette smoking.

 Runyon was investigated under the assumption of illegally saving seed, Runyon refused to "cooperate" with Monsanto. There was no lawsuit over accidental cross pollination involved, and Monsanto just resorted to blacklisting him from buying their products.

 Not likely, the previous P85S has cooling issues and is forced into a limp performance mode after a few minutes of being pushed.  




 But quarter mile times are only 6% quicker. 
  
The standard P85D is really slow to 155mph to begin with anyways at 35.8sec. Some perspective is that a M5 gets to 150mph in under 20secs. 
  
 




 Forza Jules 




 Because with a 280hp   AWD advantage the P85D was only 4mph faster then the old P85S. The new P85D only has 71 more horsepower so I'd be shocked if it gains anything more then 5mph in the quarter.  




 Tesla doesn't consume a gallon of gasoline for every mile it drives.
  
Even a F150 is getting well more then a gallon per mile.  




 Seeing has how the speed limit in the US is about 70mph then no car actually needs more then 150hp. But alas people like fast cars and when you make a fast car don't be surprise that it gets compared to other fast cars.  




 I'm talking about the old P85S, not the P85D.
  
  
Seeing that despite all the power and having AWD the P85D is only 4mph faster in the quarter mile then weaker P85S. 
  

 




 We are talking about a high performance car.
  
It's like saying you're an A+ student because you got a A+ in math while getting C's in everything else.  




 Extra weight.
  
And battery size determines how much energy you can draw and how much power your car will have. 




 I know, it's only 71hp more then the current car so I doubt it will be that much quicker in the top end.  




 Nearly a minute slower then a gas car from two years ago.  




 Unless they are adding substantially more power I doubt we will see more then a 5mph gain. The old P85s with 415hp was only 3.1mph slower in the quarter mile while lacking nearly 300hp, a ton of torque and being RWD.  




 I'm not talking about top speed, acceleration of the Model S drops off pretty dramatically at 100+mph. 
  
Some perspective the 691hp P85D has a quarter mile trap speed of 115mph.
  
A Ferrari FF which has 651hp has a quarter mile trap speed of 127mph.
  
BMW M5 with 575hp has a trap speed of 122.2mph.
  
Mercedes E63 with 577hp has a trap speed of 121.8 




 Weight is only one issue, cooling is the biggest concern. It's why the Model S can't lap the Nurburgring at full power, the batteries just get too hot. Also a good aero set up for a track is rarely a good one for increasing range.  




 
I'm not comparing it to a McLaren, I'm comparing it to other performance sedans like a BMW M5, AMG 63, or Porsche Panamera.
  

 




 Keeping large batteries cool when they are heavily push requires a lot of cooling. 




 Most likely that will only be for the top of the range Model X, I bet you the base model is going to be between 5-6s to 60mph.  




 The 918 does it in 2.2, the P1 and LaF don't mostly due to not having AWD and thus struggling to put down all their power.  




 Also just how much it struggles for grip at the low end, doesn't really catch traction for 2sec.  




 We are talking about a car that is marketed and sold as a performance machine.  




 But it's not a race car. It's simply a high-performance car.

  
I know, neither are any other car you can drive on the street. [But when a 400+hp is merely as fast as a 6 year old BMW or Ford Focus ST then I have a hard time calling it a performance car.](http://fastestlaps.com/tracks/laguna_seca.html) 




 except for the ability to run at full throttle for more than 10 continuous minutes.

  
Then we have very different views on what makes a car "high performance".  




 I'd be shocked if the next gen Roadster doesn't have the same issues that the old roadster and the current Model S do.  




 They are extremely high performance consumer cars. Not race cars.

  
Neither is any Porsche, M BMW, or AMG Mercedes yet all of them can easily manage a track day without issue.  




 Never going to happen, dropping the Gamebryo engine is going to really kill/hurt the modding community beyond the game.  




 Electric vehicles already match and beat the performance of high-end gas-powered cars at a similar price point, and it's likely a matter of time before they are competitive with low end combustion-powered vehicles.

  
In a straight line up to about 115mph, after that anything high end exotic is going to leave a tesla in the dust. On a track Teslas are really slow compared to their rivals due to overheating of batteries. They are hardly true performance cars and are more akin to straight line muscle cars of the 70s. Maybe once they can make an electric car that can actually hold up to a base 911 around a track will they become an actual performance car.
  
 




 Depends on how you define "quicker", Electric cars for the most part are one trick ponies posting insane low end acceleration figures. But beyond 0-60mph they tapper off real quick.  




 I hope they don't mind when I spit on the cash I will be paying with. 




 You know what, I'm going out tonight and I'm not going to tip! Not even a penny! 




 And that my friend is how /u/majornelson became /u/minornelson. 




 Over several years, the whole F35 program (development, procurement, maintenance/upgrades) which is about 50 years will cost us roughly 1trillion dollars in today dollars. Education is about 140billion every single year.

 He's the one lacking evidence. 




 So then it needn't be removed from Schedule 1
  
Ideally yes. Nabiximol which is currently making its way through FDA required clinical trails for treatment of pain in cancer patients though unfortunately their last trail produce weak results. Though they are also proceeding with getting it approved for treating spasticity in MS patients, which it has already in approved for in the UK, Canada, and parts of Europe. 
  
The big advantage of removing cannabis from schedule 1 status will that it will allow more ease in letting pharmaceutical companies research and derive products for treating a greater spectrum of disease and illness. 
  

   




 We kinda do. There is a cannabis extract that showed a positive effect in MS patients in large clinical trails and there is a current trial going on in the US to see if it can decrease seizures in certain epileptic children.  




 I love anecdotal accounts!  




 It's cause we are independent contractors!  




 There is some evidence for pain relief that is promising, but the most recent large clinical trial for a cannabis derived extract had disappointing results. 

 

 http://news.yahoo.com/gw-pharmas-cannabis-drug-fails-cancer-pain-study-122308627--finance.html 




 You can still get FDA exclusivity on any drug, even those derived from marijuana. As of now there are several marijuana derived drugs in development or in human clinical trials.

 "It has created a lot of confusion," Begemann said of the IARC cancer link finding. "This panel is going to review the data thoroughly, and they are going to make their findings available to everyone for review."

Monsanto said the process and the findings will be independent and will be transparent. But the company said it would be involved in providing information and data for the review.
  
If their findings are open and transparent I really don't see what's the big deal about Monsanto seeking out a review by an independent party.
  
 




 There's a lot of evidence that runs contradictory to the IARCs opinion on their classification. It isn't really that surprising that Monsanto would want to seek out an independent review.
