 I see the faces in the trees.

They've always been there. Everywhere.
Leafy faces. Smiling. Frowning. Mouths open wide. Green lips shut tight.
They don't talk. They whisper. They breathe. 

They stare.

My friends couldn't see them. The faces snickered when we went by. My friends couldn't hear them. 

It's just the wind, they said. See? It's the breeze moving the leaves.

But they were wrong. They laughed as they left me at the tree line. But now they're gone.

And every time someone asked

All I could say

I can see the faces in the trees.

Then they stopped asking. 

My mother never questioned why I dont go into the woods. She never made me. 
She told me over 

And over

It was okay if I saw something

But I shouldn't be afraid

And I wasn't. 

Then

My mother went into the woods one day. The faces watched her go, and so did I.
When she came back she hugged me tight. 

I see them now 

She whispered in my ear

Then

She was gone.

They came again with the questions. There's nothing in the trees.
Trust us. 

They stopped coming

When all I could say

I can see the faces in the trees.

My mother saw them before they took her.

And now

When you pass by 

You'll see them too


 




 That's what I'm guessing it is. Everyone is saying poison ivy, but poison ivy wouldn't leave those hairs. 




 Caladryl is what I'm using now- calamine lotion and liquid benadryl.
