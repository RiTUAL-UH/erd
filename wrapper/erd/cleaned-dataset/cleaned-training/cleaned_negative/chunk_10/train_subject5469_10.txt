 It's ok. We shipped a bunch of rednecks to the Middle East to protest there. 









 I knew you would show up. Damn egomaniac. 









 Ever read ["The Good Marriage"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Good_Marriage)? Had me worried there for a minute, Op. 




 Thank you, and I am really unhappy that I came across as defending myself.  




 Obviously. 




 Tried posting this on SoL and reddit, got banned and removed, sooo looks like this is real. Or we are being meta-trolled. 




 It's a story from a Pulitzer Prize winning major news organization about a discovery made by the University of Connecticut.  




 This is kind of like scooping turds from a public pool. 









 Acted like a fucking Nazi in a concentration camp.  




 There was an FBI report published not long ago about how White Supremacist organizations were recruiting into local police departments.  




 This is one of the most disturbing stories I have seen in years. Unbelievable that a human being can do this to another person. The rest- the Whistleblower getting fired? It's just fucking unspeakable. 




 Number 1. Tue 1:28pm pst 




 Bernie tried to pass a national infrastructure bill that would have fixed bridges and put over a million people to work. Republicans killed it. 









 This has everything to do with stockholders and publicly traded companies.  




 [USA Today Reported](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/07/20/collapsed--10-bridge-given-rating-just-last-year/30428515/) that the I-10 bridge that collapsed in Riverside County was given an 'A' rating a year ago. This is false.

There are two, 2 lane Bridges; eastbound and westbound. The newer westbound bridge was given an 'A' rating. *The bridge that collapsed, the eastbound bridge, was given a "Functionally Obsolete" rating by the National Bridge Inventory.* Functionally Obsolete ratings are given to bridges that are in such disrepair or old enough that the only thing to do is destroy them and start over. 

Why the USA Today headline stated that it had an 'A' rating was either extremely bad journalism or an attempt to calm drivers/avoid lawsuits. 

Story that notes the Functionally Obsolete rating of the eastbound bridge:

While officials had deemed the Tex Wash bridge on eastbound I-10 "functionally obsolete," its westbound bridge  also built in 1967  was listed as "not deficient."

 Wow. Then these franchises and other multinationals will have to pay Americans the same rate they have to pay Europeans. Poor billionaires.  




 My first move as a mom after that? Go to the little shits room, pick up the ONE thing he loves the most and smash the hell out of it. Never replace either one. 

Of course- my kids would never have dared act like that. Ever. 




 Make sure and set out a shallow bowl of water if you get into a drought situation. 




 I'll use the example of my Apache friend. 

His family (especially grandma) are Traditional. They don't want electricity, they want to live in traditional housing, keep livestock, grow and cook traditional foods and make clothing- maintain their culture. The kids are taught the Apache language (my friend knows Apache and Navajo). 

BIA came on the rez and built these little modular homes and literally tried to force the traditionals to live in them and give up their gardens and livestock. The great grandmother had spent time in a BIA School where they were beaten for speaking their native language. To the family, this was the same sort of thing. 

To kill a peoples traditions and culture and homogenize them is cultural genocide. It has been done many times in the past; often by use of violence- especially in the name of Christianity. Right now Europe is trying to do this to the Roma Gypsy culture. 

btw- the BIA was not legally successful in making the traditional people give up their lifestyle.

And the segregation part? I am sure you have seen the 'whites only' drinking fountain pictures.

The important thing is to allow equality for all mankind while supporting and appreciating different cultural traditions. 




 And the main lesson to 'getting it right' is that the people - his Ka Tet - are more important than reaching the Tower.  




 Regular horses, Pally Charger, War horse - then rep grind for faction mounts. Had the only gnome on a cat mount on my server for a short while. 




 Right here. Couldn't pally without that one. 




 OMG!! Now I have to go log in and see.

 I want your job. 

In 2 weeks I would have them all playing Wow in their own 'Archimonde and Alzheimers' guild.

 I just believe that cultural homogenization is as bad as racial segregation.

edit: As in 'Whites only' or 'No Jews allowed'. 
 




 You forgot the /s 




  car

My high school boy friend and his buddies had 

1968 GTO with flames up the nose - that they dropped a 455 in.

1965 Mustang - original Forest Green. They put a different motor in it too but I can't recall offhand what it was.

1964 gray Fury with a push button tranny that was a sleeper- they put hydraulic lifts under it and capped the headers - running a push button to the inside. So if some muscle car rolled up beside this 'grandma' car he could jack it and uncap the headers at the same time. 

It did an 8.5 quarter mile out at the airport (where they used to race).  We called it the Gray Goose.  




 I have no idea why this is being down voted. You are absolutely right and frame it very well. This exact reasoning is why people spend thousands of dollars to travel to new places, to explore the cultural differences and have new experiences through them.  




 Oh ok, gotcha. 









 "administered treatment on the NHS" I don't understand. 




 At 37 m (120 ft) in length, the largest known specimen was longer than a blue whale and is considered one of the longest known animals in the world.

 It goes deeper than that. Oil producers literally have the power to prevent a country from going to war. 




 We have had a rising trend of shark attacks worldwide. Basically- here is another one.

  Brynden Rivers is the three eyed crow? 




 And of course the more cancer cases- for private for-profit hospitals - you are assuring future earnings by keeping the cancer train going. 




 Point 1: Maybe /u/spez is naive enough that he doesn't understand that there are major marketing/pr groups that consistently troll reddit to insert social, political or non-scientific (but profitable) points of view. 

These people aren't expressing 'free speech', they are posting corporate sponsored messaging. 

Point 2: Building a sub is like building a house. Admin preventing mods from unwanted and unwarranted intrusion is like the police telling everyone they have to let people come in their houses at will and they can't do anything about it.

If they want to kill reddit- this is a sure way to do it.  




 It's mentioned in the comments that quadrupeds die more often to this than bi-peds because the lightning goes up one set of legs then through the body - exiting out the other set. Which is also interesting in light of dinosaur strikes. 




 They were burned. Standing under the tree and it was hit- went through the tree/roots to cow. It happens all of the time. It happened to some horses at a farm my friend boarded her horse at. Two of them were still on their feet-dead.

 You would not see them post without some Bubba coming in and yelling "SJW!". 




 He did say he learned 'wisdom' from a couple of racist sites, that he wasn't raised that way.

Seriously, what is the difference if he learned it from reddit or some other forum? The result is the same.  




 Germany, France and Italy do not allow them public space. They have painful, historic knowledge of what the outcome could be.  




 Racists are not the reddit base. But they will be if this goes on because the good folks will leave them to their self-made cess-pit. A cess-pit that any normal person would be embarrassed to be part of and that advertisers will never touch. 




 because the new CEO is a biiiiiiiiiiig believer in free speech at all cost

Then he needs to run through a Theatre yelling "FIRE!" and see how far that gets him. 




  If I run a subreddit, and believe cutting off oxygen to these views are the best way of solving the problem.

And after being trolled and brigaded for years, possibly by hirees from PR Firms, /r/science and other scientific subs cut off oxygen to the climate change denial brigade. 

What are they going to do now?

 




 I didn't shut down /r/StormComing over the Pao affair. I have been in business long enough to know that what is happening under the surface is probably entirely different from appearances. Plus it's a small sub.

But if I could not remove bad posts or remarks from my own sub I would shut down immediately. 




  It's fine the first ten times, but by the twentieth, you tire of covering the same ground over and over again.

Point being- if something is brought up 20 times then it is probably a problem.

 




 It's not just racism. subs like /r/science have banned climate change denialism and non-scientific profit based bs articles. The Koch backed groups would have a hay-day over there. If even just from spite.

I could even see some of the default subs having to shut down over that. 




 The *real* issue with gypsies is that they refuse to register via birth certificates, drivers licenses or any of the personal 'tagging' that states and countries do to individuals. They don't support massive economies and they aren't of the consumer class. 

They are one of the last 'free people' left on earth and a lot of negative PR is generated against them. Unfortunately, average people buy into it, rumors spread, etc. Kind of like how the Nazis successfully excoriated the Jews. I am not saying the gypsies are perfect, but it's interesting how all people speak about FREEDOM!! But when there is a population of people actually *living* it, they freak out. 




 Very strange- I did a search on South Dakota and the only sub that appeared was yours and one other that was private. Just figured there weren't many SD redditors. 




 Another thought is- would the amount of lightning be more extreme? We know the rain would be because a warmer atmosphere holds more moisture, but what of the lightning? 




 I have seen dead cattle laying at the base of a tree that was hit by lightning. They don't have to take a direct hit. Very thought provoking question.  




 Ever since Walmart started selling computers. Yes. 




 If SD had a subreddit (if there is one I couldn't find it) I would have posted it there. Maybe you should make one.

Often people who live in a region know and can text friends and family living in another part of the region. Like during [this event](https://www.reddit.com/r/StormComing/comments/23rgt5/significant_multiday_severe_event_expected_across/?) I received messages from people from all over those regions saying they were able to warn family and friends in the impacted zones.

 This kind of bullshit talk has been ongoing on wing-nut blogs and infowars for weeks now. Not surprised some christian taliban preacher is preaching it in public. 



















 The reality is that this is just how many hospitals negotiate pricing against institutional payers like insurance companies. They set the price absurdly high and then make the insurance companies negotiate them down.

As opposed to every other 1st world country on earth which makes pharm companies bid against each other for lowest cost. 




 Friend in the UK had double knee replacement surgery. Total cost: 10 equivalent US dollars- because he went over the 150 per year pharmaceutical limit. Of course medications are about 20% of what Americans pay because the government bids on pharm costs.

 Here is a very good, quick explanation as to why. https://youtu.be/gAiA-_iQjdU 




 Hmm.. I don't see any adverts on the video. Maybe my Ad Block is blocking them. 




 If you read the sticky you will see that we have posted storm warnings that have actually assisted people in taking cover or warning relatives. We try to stay on top of events such as PDS (Particularly Dangerous Situation) NWS Warnings for tornado outbreaks and post these ahead of time. [Here is a sample of one that was also xposted to the regional areas it was affecting](https://www.reddit.com/r/StormComing/comments/23rgt5/significant_multiday_severe_event_expected_across/?). Otherwise we archive the after storm story. 

I just happened to be following Dan Gottshalks twitter feed last night on his chase and caught that when it was posted, so popped the link in here.

Tornados are not exceptional in Ill, but it is late in the season and it kind of caught the NWS by surprise with only a 2% chance that day of tornados in the area.  




 From Dans Twitter feed https://twitter.com/dangottschalk 



















 Arial, Trebuchet, Comic Sans and Cambria all on one page. I didn't think it was humanly possible. 

edit: oh shit I missed the Tahoma for the links that actually end halfway across the page in the drop-down box.  




 You have a nice portfolio with a great range of subject matter.  Tip: I wouldn't bother to try to get a good critique from this sub on my dogs most recent clip, frankly. 




 Karmic even. 




 The grandmother, Willa Mae Pennington, was found dead on Tuesday among debris from the familys shattered *mobile homes*,

Some of the images were of Modular Homes. Slightly different. They are brought to the building site in parts and built on site on a foundation as opposed to being towed to a site whole and set up on blocks like a mobile.
 




 You don't need to generally as I treat those posts like cockroaches. Boom-gone. We are, as a general rule, archiving events. 









 There probably is on Youtube by now. Feel free to post one if you find it. 














 The massive fire is also threatening two major oil sand projects in Saskatchewan. 

















































 Sure enough and thanks! Mods on here are great :) 




 If you are just talking about numbers, 11 Tropical Cyclones in Nine Weeks is a record. I agree that they get a little click-baity and I don't like the format of the website, but they actually don't broadcast all of the extreme weather events happening now. If they did it would look like the Apocalypse Channel. 




 **For new members and a reminder to our veterans:**

/r/StormComing is simply this: an Archive of Earth Changing Disasters and Events, manmade or natural.
It's not a place for HAARPtards, Climate Change Deniers, Flat-Earthers, or Eschatology/Rapturists to post theorems. And as we want to attract sane, logical redditors, we don't want to hear about how radiation is good for everyone.  #3232;_ #3232;

This sub is best read using 'new' rather than 'hot' or 'top' as it is an archive of events.
If you want to add an Earth-changing or disaster story from the news or reliable source, please do. Since headline writers often fail, feel free to editorialize titles to fill in important details from the story- especially the location.

We have already heard from someone who saw a flash flood forecast here that saved them from swimming home from work. Other redditors have been alerted to Tornado Outbreaks and took safety precautions. So we feel we are fulfilling the purpose of the sub.

As /r/StormComing is an archive of events, there is nothing subjective about it. Downvoting anything here would be as stupid as downvoting an encyclopedia entry.

Feel free to x-post to other reddits, especially reddits that are geographically related to the area the event or warning concerns. Please insert the np when doing so. As in www.*np*.reddit.com/r/StormComing.blah.blah in the referral link back to /r/StormComing.

Thank you! And if you have any great ideas about the sub and what we can do to improve it- we would love to hear from you. 



















 I have heard that comparison, and this is why it is bullshit: 

Video games *do not* actively encourage real-life, hostile behavior toward a minority segment of society by real human beings sitting in positions of acting authority. 

If you have ever been to a white supremacist website you will see constant, active discussions about how certain races need to be eradicated because they are 'dangerous' to the rest of polite society. 

To a young, impressionable or susceptible person lurking on these sites it could seem as if the majority of people, including people in leadership, feel this way and that by taking the sort of action the shooter took that he would be hailed as a hero.

This is not comparable to 'violent video games' in the slightest. 




 Time is money, friends! 




 Roof said explicitly in his manifesto that he was not raised racist and he 'woke up' after discovering a white supremacist website online.

So basically he would not have found the sanction and encouragement to be as racist as he became - racist enough to go on a shooting spree.

What the hell can I say? It's a fucking shame, but it's a fact.

The real question is whether or not Reddit is willing to host the sort of 'free speech' that can lead to an event such as this. What would happen to Reddit if the kid had mentioned /r/coontown for having been an influence? Can you even imagine?

There is no debate in Germany, Italy or France. They have had experience with this that lead to a World War and the genocide of millions. Hate sites are banned in those countries. I can't judge them for that, knowing their history.

 




 A farmer was riding his donkey one day and upon reaching the river the donkey planted his feet and would not enter. The farmer cursed and kicked the donkey and it still would not enter. Finally the farmer leaped to the ground and shot the donkey in the head.

The farmer, still cursing the donkey, strode boldly into the river ... and was attacked and eaten by a million piraa.

 I'll just repeat a comment I made about the Philippines last week:


Quote from an article about a little boy studying by the light from a Mcdonalds in the street:

---------------------------------

 *Despite strong economic growth in recent years,* roughly one quarter of the Philippines' 100 million people still live on less than one dollar a day, and giant slums dominate all major cities.

Just a reminder that most of the time 'strong economic growth' means that some bastards are getting ultra rich at the expense of the majority.

 These were from the 1960's. The 1950's until the Russians invaded and then the Beardy Men took over were a renaissance for Afghanistan.

During the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, the government of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) reformed the education system; education was stressed for both sexes, and widespread literacy programmes were set up. By 1978, women made up 40 percent of the doctors and 60 percent of the teachers at Kabul University; 440,000 female students were enrolled in educational institutions and 80,000 more in literacy programs.

 Europeans went from basically living in mud huts to developing the great architectural marvels after contact with the middle east during the Crusades.

"Afghan girls, as well as boys, were educated up to the high school level, and although girls (and boys) wore uniforms, the girls were not allowed to wear a chadri (burka) on their way to secondary school. Able young women attended college, as did the men." - Peg Podlich #

 Aquarist for 45 years. Was in the fish industry - wholesale and retail for nearly 20 of them. I have always let spot algae (if it grew) grow on my back glass and sometimes end sides of my tanks (if the tank were in a wall). I also let it grow on my driftwood and rocks to a degree if it showed up. I have never had an issue with this and it provides Ottos   Amanos a regular diet. I have also not had an issue of it 'transferring' to healthy plants. I think it provides a more natural microbiota in the tank and lends a more natural look until it runs it's course.

But that's just my experience. 




 Probably 7.5. Alkaline but not outrageous. Add driftwood to help bring it down a little. I would say try the magnesium treatment with epsom salts. You never said how old your tank is.

Edit: in case you are interested- here is a [paper](http://plantcellbiology.masters.grkraj.org/html/Plant_Cellular_Physiology4-Absorption_Of_Mineral_Nutrients.htm) on effect of ph on plant nutrient uptake:

The degree of ionization of minerals and other nutrients depends upon the hydrogen ion concentration of the soil solution.  For example, most of the phosphate ions, at alkaline pH exist either as bivalent H3PO4 ions or trivalent H3PO4 ions.  Such ions are not favored for absorption.  On the other hand neutral pH favors the absorption of monovalent ions.  So the soil pH has a significant effect not only on the rate but also the kind of ions uptake.

 Hi Ned. I was friends with Lisa Levy's father so I feel a bit of a 'kinship' to Bundy victims/families in an odd way.

Curious though, do you have any pictures of your mother or any other information on the case that hasn't already been publicized repeatedly? 









 It was from an NOAA slide show presentation. And those were the words used.  




 The only one I know of is someone who compiles events into a video once a month or so- but he is rather hit and miss. He is skilled at what he does, however it is a bit tinged with 'end times' flavor. Not overly religious, though. His last compilation video:

 This is a great compilation- thank you for this.  




 Despite strong economic growth in recent years, roughly one quarter of the Philippines' 100 million people still live on less than one dollar a day, and giant slums dominate all major cities.

Just a reminder that most of the time 'strong economic growth' means that some bastards are getting ultra rich at the expense of the majority.  




 If your fish are fine your ph should be within range. But if it is off and the fish have just adjusted it could cause the plants difficulty in uptake of nutrients. Also, if they are magnesium deficient they will have trouble taking up nutrients. I am leaning toward this. 

Start with a half teaspoon of pure epsom salts per 20g. Get the kind that you can use as a laxative as it has no scents/chemicals. 

See how they look in a week.  




 In 20 years working in the fish industry I always heard of people who successfully kept goldfish for 20 years in a 10 gallon or never, ever did water changes, etc etc. Even if those things were true they were the equivalent of turning water into wine. 

Crayfish are fast, nocturnal carnivores who live on small fish.

Bettas are lazy, bright colored, slow swimmers who have a habit of sleeping at the bottom of the tank at night. 

You tell me.  




 Stick a [castle](http://imgur.com/a/oDOUG) in it. :D 




 These people will figure out one day that they are on the internet and crap-ass service like this gets around quick. 




 I [dose this with Flourish and liquid Iron](http://imgur.com/a/wwc9i) about once a month and use under gravel tabs twice a year under the root feeders- other than that the fish take care of it all. The only thing I have put in that didn't do well was some eleocharis that I added from our stream. It's all pretty low care plants. 




 What is your lighting and what are the plants on the right? What are you doing for trace elements? How long has it been set up? What are your parameters, ph etc? 




 I just popped in here to say this. Someone sprayed something or put hands or tools in the tank with toxins on it. 

Always turn off your pumps, filters and throw a cover over the tank when doing any kind of spraying- even furniture dusting. If it is for bugs- repellent or killer - seal the cover with tape. I used to use yard size garbage bags for this. 




 Absolutely have to have cory's in a school. That's not a lifestyle choice with cory's, it's a necessity. 

The 'pinning' himself -hiding behavior is a stress response to being alone.  




 Dead on. And I would add to vacuum the gravel well every few days for a couple of weeks- doing a 10 to 20 percent water change each time. Get those little bastards out of there before they hatch and start a new cycle. 

Every tank on earth probably has ich, whether your fish gets it or not is dependent on their stress level.  




 Kind of like asking "How big of an enclosure can I keep this lion and gazelle together in?" 




 Congratulations. They can be incredibly difficult keepers. 




 It's more like tattooing. Never buy artificially colored fish please. 




 You can always put a half teaspoon per 10g of pure Epsom Salts - and the magnesium will be good for the plants. Just make sure and dose according to the actual amount of water in the tank - not by the tank dimensions. And /u/longlostbleu is correct with the Malefix also.

 A Prayer for Owen Meany- John Irving

The last paragraph utterly crushed me and the last line was like a spike through my flattened remains. I would spontaneously burst into tears for days after finishing the novel.

 Those clouds gathered and turned into a hella storm up at the lake today. 




 Just don't let him go to Toronto. 




 No, they don't destroy brick and concrete structures as easily as wood and plasterboard. The EF rating system for Tornados is developed around the type of home or building that is destroyed and the level of destruction. Tornados that destroy brick or block structures are of a higher rating on the 1 to 5 scale than those that destroy frame homes. 

I lived through the '74 SuperOutbreak, have been a chaser and I have been through a few Hurricanes. You can always tell the wood built homes after an EF5 because those are the ones with scrubbed foundations. 

The long term after-effects of dealing with the standard wood frame, drywall and fiber insulation is also much worse than a block or brick home. When it is ground up into dust size particles it causes ['Tornado Cough' as a very long term after effect.](http://kfor.com/2013/06/19/tornado-cough-threatening-families-in-devastated-areas/) 

I lived through the eye of Opal in my Florida 'hurricane' house built in the 1950's of cement block with terrazzo floor and a cement and gravel roof.  A new neighborhood 2 blocks away from my house was built with wood and shingle homes. The destruction there was incredible. There was basically no destruction in our neighborhood besides someone who lost a garage door and a few overhang awnings that ended up in a golf course.
