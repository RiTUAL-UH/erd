  Nearly 1,000 bridges in Arizona are labeled as problematic by the Federal Highway Administration.

 There are 8,035 highway bridges in Arizona in the 2014 National Bridge Inventory Database, compiled the FHA. Of those, 256 are considered structurally deficient and 684 are functionally obsolete. 









 Just like in 1992 with the Perot-test vote that got Perot 19% of the vote. 









 Could Donald Trump become the next Ross Perot?

Perot drew 19% of the popular vote in 1992 - - possibly taking away enough votes from Bush #1 to hand the election to Bill Clinton. 




 Yes. Unlike most of the rest of the 20+ candidates he speaks what he feels is the truth, not what is politically correct. 

Bernie Sanders oddly enough is the only other candidate that also freely speaks "his truth" rather than political speak.  




  Trumps the choice of 24 percent of Republican and Republican-leaning independent voters, according to the Post/ABC numbers. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is second with 13 percent. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is third with 12 percent. 









 What a great tribute to this collector. Well done kind sir, well done! 









 The "sources" used in this article are inadequate. Are there quotes of Bernie Sanders actually "self declaring" he is a socialist? I looked, and I didn't find them.  









 The why to I keep seeing the quote about him being a self-described socialist? Is this false? If so why is it so widely repeated, and not corrected? 




 After winning 1,000,000, the payout was suspended when Ingram was accused of cheating by having his wife, Diana, and an accomplice, Tecwen Whittock, cough as Ingram announced the correct answer from the available choices. Following a trial at Southwark Crown Court lasting four weeks Charles and Diana Ingram and Whittock were convicted by a majority verdict of "procuring the execution of a valuable security by deception".

The Ingrams and Whittock were each given prison sentences suspended for two years (the Ingrams were sentenced to 18 months and Whittock was sentenced to 12 months, also suspended), each fined 15,000, and each ordered to pay 10,000 towards prosecution costs. The trial judge ordered the Ingrams to pay additional defence costs: Charles Ingram 40,000 and Diana Ingram 25,000. Altogether with legal fees, the Ingrams had to pay 115,000. 




 Sanders went out of his way to establish his progressive bona fides on issue after issue as a cheering contingent of supporters yelled, hollered and clinked silverware on glasses to indicate their support for his campaign.

The Vermont senator, who is a self-identified socialist, railed against the powers that be in Washington, DC and warned that the billionaire class is so powerful that nothing will get done unless millions of people stand up and loudly proclaim that enough is enough. 




 That is a terrible article - - on many levels.  




 I live in the SF Bay area and we have several programs that also reach out to  Hispanic communities to get kids into swimming programs. There have been disproportionate rates of drownings among Hispanics at our rivers and lakes.

 True, but they all have issues to resolve - hopefully peacefully. 

The Park-Xi summit in 2013 showed promise of warming relations, but this quickly chilled after China extended their Air Defense Identification Zone (East China Sea) over South Korean territory. Despite this, in July 2014, Xi visited South Korea before its traditional ally North Korea, and in their talks, both leaders affirmed their support for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula and the ongoing free trade agreement negotiations. Both leaders also expressed their concerns over Japanese Prime Minister Shinz Abe's reinterpretation of Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution (armed forces with war potential will not be maintained).

 All that works fine for me in Outlook. 




  Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby ...

 Israel wants a 50% increase in their already **huge** military aid when Congress's sequestration is going to result in firing 40,000 active-duty soldiers? Israel needs to look elsewhere.  




 There has been so much pain and so many accusations through a 2+ year divorce process that it would be tough for me to pick out which issues to try to resolve at this point. 

I think this one is best left alone for now. Down the road . . . maybe. 




 Hey, I'm not promoting these guys. But look back and think about how un-likely it looked in the early days that any of these unknowns with little experience would get elected: Carter, Clinton, Obama. Just saying.

Sounds like a Michelin Star meal to me. 




 Israel needs to appeal to some other countries for a while. Maybe Germany has some guilt issues they can appeal to. As an American, I've had enough of "nation building". It's not our fight any more.  




 Walker's record as governor of Wisconsin excites many Republicans. He's got a solid rsum as a small-government conservative. His social-conservative credentials are also strong, but without the culture-warrior baggage that sometimes brings. And Walker has won three difficult elections in a blue-ish state.

Rubio - Charles Krauthammer pegs him as the Republican frontrunner. His best hope seems to be to emerge as a consensus candidate who can appeal to social conservatives and hawks, and he's even sounded some libertarian notes of late. He's well-liked by Republicans, and has surged forward since announcing, but he needs to move up from second choice to first choice for more of them. Rubio seems to scare Democrats more than any other candidate, too.

Paul - He's relatively permissive on drugs, passionate about civil liberties, and adamantly in favor of restraint on foreign policy. But Paul has worked hard to firm up establishment ties since reaching the Senate, and he has recently worked to paper over his differences with GOPs hawkish wing, calling for a declaration of war against ISIS and generally saber-rattling. He is positioning himself as a candidate with crossover appeal in the general election.
 




 I take it you are most likely voting against any Republican candidate, that thus they are "the enemy"

I have always thought it important to know the enemy well.

I guarantee you there are several Republican candidates that are very smart, very articulate, and persuasive (if not to you). 

Depending who is nominated, this is not likely to be a cakewalk for the Democrat nominee.  




 "Russia can barely afford its . . ."

 Hitler as a child - take him right out of the twentieth century. Maybe he could be an artistic savant instead of a genocidal fuck.  




 That question triggered some interesting thoughts. And those thoughts are bio-electric patterns between the synapses of my brain - they don't have mass per se, they are emergent properties of the process. The neurons and neurotransmitters involved in the process do have a mass, just like a cell has mass, but my thoughts are separate from those biological components, and are real, and exist, but they do not have mass. 




 Wow - - I hope your parents aren't very old. That looks like a good way to fall and break a hip.  




 Another victory for individual rights.

From another report "argued that the law allowed the police and security services to spy on citizens without proper safeguards. They argued that the legislation was incompatible with article eight of the European convention on human rights, the right to respect for private and family life, and articles seven and eight of the EU charter of fundamental rights, respect for private and family life and protection of personal data." 




 I wish other geographies no harm, but being in California, I can only say BRING IT ON !!!

 "The 2015 El Nio is likely to strengthen in the coming weeks, largely due to recent tropical cyclone activity. Several tropical cyclones, including a rare July cyclone in the southern hemisphere, have resulted in a strong reversal of trade winds near the equator. This is likely to increase temperatures below the surface of the tropical Pacific Ocean, which may in turn raise sea surface temperatures further in the coming months."

 If this does happen, it would mean a strengthening for El Nio, but by how much is unknown. 




 On Thursday Draghi added his voice to calls for debt relief for Greece -- whose debts amount to 180 percent of economic output -- saying the main question at this stage was what form this relief should take.
Athens has already failed to make two key payments to the International Monetary Fund and its next debt deadline is a 4.2-billion-euro payment to the ECB itself on July 20, a deadline Draghi said he was sure would be met.
Speaking in Frankfurt, the ECB chief also said the conditions were "in place" to raise the ceiling on the Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) available to Greek banks, despite questions about their solvency.
The ELA -- which has kept Greek banks, and by extension the economy, afloat -- has been fixed at around 89 billion euros since late June, but would be topped up with an additional 900 million euros, Draghi said.

 Japan is ready to once again assume the responsibility for protecting its own borders (with a cautious eye on its history of aggression). I think this is a good thing.

 Yep. Whoever caught that picture of the camouflaged homo sapiens in the wild did a great job.  




  I think candidates will disqualify themselves one by one by scandals, leaks or public gaffes

Hahaha. I worry that's what's going to happen to Hillary. 




 I am not likely to vote Republican. That said, I look forward to the debates. There are several very qualified and serious candidates. I think you might be surprised at how quickly one of the 15 can gain steam.  




 Totally agree. 

My post in this thread about "My Daughter" - - my realization of responsibility to others and not being selfish  - - made all the difference.  




 She was 13. She was drug through the mud when my ex made the divorce really nasty.

How did I recover? . . . not sure I have. But I still love my "little girl" who is doing great, so I will continue to be there for her. 




 My daughter.

During a brutal divorce - - my ex told my daughter very hateful lies about me - - awful things.

Ex also told my daughter that I was suicidal, and that it would be best if I just did it.

One day I have an argument with my daughter and she says "Why don't you just kill yourself!!?"

Recovering from that was one of the toughest things I've ever done. I never brought it up again, never threw it in her face, just moved on. 

I'll tell you, I was very depressed, and that nearly took me over the edge.

But, I love my little girl so much, I kept it together despite the pain. 




 Ha! and I just saw this post: Thick snow blankets parts of southern Queensland in what could be state's most significant snowfall in 30 years

That must just be weather change, not climate change.  




 Wait - does that mean that Putin will now be in favor of an ongoing investigation? 




  Japan ready to fight, again.

Please. More like Japan ready to assume responsibility for protecting its own boarders, with a cautious eye on history of aggression.  




 So, is that a weather anomaly, or is that climate change? I guess time will tell.  




 Good luck PutiPut. The world knows your hands are not clean.  




 Humans are inferior. Must subjugate. 




 Well, I don't think we said we were changing our stance on Cuba - - just our tactics. So, Cuba, you would be correct.  




 It was on my evening commute back from class at SF State to my house in Portola Valley - so it was dark and way after the rush hour commute - probably around 10 PM.

The commute was great. 3 or 4 lanes the whole way and almost no traffic. I would fly down 280 with music blaring (I build speakers into my helmet) then hit the hot tub as soon as I got home. 

I got several tickets - - one more point and I would have lost my license. C'est La Vie. 




  There is an unconfirmed report of an oil spill in reef waters south of Townsville

"A Customs aircraft was unable to locate the reported spill this morning and we are arranging for another aerial helicopter flight this afternoon," she said.

 Age 17, my dad just retired and was moving from Texas to CA with me and my same age step brother. A couple weeks before the move I said "fuck this - - it's your move not mine". I bought a motorcycle, packed up my shit, and slept on a friend's parent's couch until I could find my own apartment.  




  caught at high speed

Probably going around 90 mph on my "crotch rocket" 




 Yah. I'm pretty sure CPS would intervene if they saw this and had an ID on the woman and child.  




 I was ordered to do this on HWY 280 in SF when caught at high speed on my motorcycle. The cop ordered me, over the loud speaker, to take out my keys and hold them out to the side.

No chance he was going to let me speed off as he approached me.

 "Conservatives are Actually Trying to Claim Donald Trump is Really a Liberal" because they are terrified that he will leave the Republican primary and go independent. That would draw way more votes from Republicans, and could easily swing the election.  




 [Women in combat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_combat#United_States) - On January 24, 2013, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta removed the military's ban on women serving in combat. Implementation of these rules is ongoing. There is some speculation that this could lead to women having to register with the Selective Service System. The United States Marine Corps is still in its infancy stages of allowing women into combat positions. Army Ranger Battalions and Navy SEAL units plan to integrate women by 2015 and 2016, respectively.

 Just the opposite in the US. We have a history of lawyers that were able to get large judgments against "good samaritans" who tried to help, but did not provide the care that a trained medical professional would provide. This was so widely publicized that people were afraid to help. Eventually laws were passed protecting "good samaritans" from prosecution and civil suit. 

But a law compelling action? F-that . . . this is A'merca!!!

 Today, as an American, I feel shame.

"The 53 page Pentagon report issued almost two months after the incident, while not directly stating the point, found that almost all of the immediate details given of the shooting-down were erroneous, yet absolved the officers and crew."

"the United States did not admit legal liability but agreed to pay on an ex gratia basis US$61.8 million, amounting to $213,103.45 per passenger, in compensation to the families of the Iranian victims."

 I wonder if they will have to pay state taxes in every state they work in - - like the players do.

"Each player must generally pay tax in the state the income is earned. For example, if a Missouri resident plays a game in Wisconsin and receives game day pay, the player will owe income tax to Wisconsin on the earnings from that game  while all other income is not taxed in Wisconsin.

In addition to the earnings in each state, a taxpayer generally must pay tax to his state of residency. Most states subject an individual to a tax on worldwide income if he/she is a resident of such state. Although, the state may grant tax credits or deductions for taxes paid to other states."
