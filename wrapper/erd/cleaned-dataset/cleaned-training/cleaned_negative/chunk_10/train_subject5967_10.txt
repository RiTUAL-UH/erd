 I would**n't** agree about the cheat meal thing, if you feel like you **need it** for sanity purposes, it's perfectly fine to do. But obviously if you don't need to do it, don't do it!

I myself don't have set cheat meals and the only time I actually do anything like that is for rare special events with friends/family, birthday dinners etc.

Edit: Oh whoops, I just realised how confusing my post is. I meant to say **wouldn't**

 They're there. Look harder. My train ride this morning was made more frustrating because a heavily obese person was blocking the seat next to her and the seat opposite her.  




   They see it more as a "I ate less for a few days and still didn't lose weight".

Or they do do it for 2-3 weeks, but it's dishonest CICO. Almost like they're trying to prove it doesn't work. I've had friends tell me before "I don't count the calories I drink". Meanwhile they have bottle after bottle of soda. 

 




 It really does come down to portions most of the time. My dinners still consist of my favourite food (steak). I just now get smaller cuts and remove the fat. I'm still satiated. I don't need to eat a 400 gram steak since a 200 gram leaner steak tastes more or less the same.

 




 I eat at least 1 apple every day, I'm not fucking scared of diabetes from that, you're right - it's dumb advice. 




 Ask damn near **any** non smoker if they would ever date a smoker.

The answer is always "Bleg, no fucking way". No one bats an eye towards that response. Now replace *smoker* with *obese person* 




 My dad (who is very proud of my progress) calls me skinny, it's mostly in jest (I'm still 237 lbs). 

I find it funny and kinda like it . The reason being because for him to make that joke he has established in his own mind the progress that I've made. Its a real compliment.

To each is own I guess.

 Get home at 3 am with the gf at the time, we then had drunken sex. My friend had just caught a taxi back after buying like 20 cheese burgers from McDonald's.

He then proceeds to barge in my bedroom door and throw 5 cheeseburgers at us going at it. He then bails in a fury of awkwardness.

We decided to stop what we were doing, collect ourselves and have a cheeseburger break.

 




 Ok. 




 Neither did I.

 I'm at such a mid point that my go to 'high five height' is at such a level that tall people don't need to bend down and short people don't have to jump up to high five me. 




 Let me put your mind at ease. For you to have actually gained that 3 lbs, you would have had to eat 10,500 calories more than your daily expenditure. 

Obviously that's not the case. 




 :3 




 Its been 4 and a half months since I started losing and I made the conscious decision to completely cut beer out of my diet. Now I'm not a complete teetotaler. I've had drinks exactly 4 times in that time period, all for specific milestones with my friends.

Each and everytime I've done it I've always retained water for quite a few days afterwards. It's really interesting actually.

The most recent time was 2 weeks ago, I had a few drinks during the day and for the next few days I had actually gained 2 lbs. Then half way through the following week **whoosh**, dropped down 4 lbs. 




 Hey, I started at 285 lbs (27 M, 5'9"). I'm now 237 lbs after a bit over 4 months. Listen to what /u/funchords says, the dude knows his stuff.

But the time will fly by if you let it. Make the necessary changes to your diet intake and then make it part of your routine.

The most important thing? **Do your research**. Know how much you need to consume daily and eat at that budget. Factor in *some* exercise, but don't think that exercise will contribute nearly as much to your weight loss as diet, because it won't.

Weight loss is 80% diet, 20% exercise.

Finally, while I recommend doing lots of reading here at /r/loseit, try not to obsess over your weight loss too much. Daily visits here for hours on end can make time slow down dramatically, since weight loss is about the long haul, you need to be patient. 




 I'm wondering how much of a self fulfilling prophecy these articles are?

How many people do you guys know who wont try to lose weight because they think it's too hard? Sadly most of these people are spoon fed pseudoscience nonsense about the subject.

Diets fail because of people, not diets themselves. If you tell someone, you're going to fail at something over and over. They're likely to do so. If you tell them, something will only fail if you let it fail, then they realise that what we're doing is 100% a willpower thing.

I think a more simple solution to this epidemic is to combat the misinformation which is so rampant in our society.

Edit for caveat:

Ok, so even if this '5% of dieters succeed long term' wasn't complete nonsense. **So fucking what?** I'm not succeeding because I rolled the dice and got lucky. I'm succeeding because I wan't to succeed, because I care about my body and because I wan't to live till 80. 




 Can...Can you be my parent? 




 I think the bottom line for me is, polyamory is perfectly fine - if all parties are aware and consent of the situation.

My house mate is polyamorous and his lady friends are all fully aware of it and enjoy it. It's an fascinating sight actually. 




 I think adopting 'social egalitarian' will do wonders for the current feminism movement. By adding a all encompassing moniker, it adds strength to the movement as a whole.

Imagine if the LGBT community was split off into it's own factions still. 




 I'm a man and I believe this to be true. In my anecdotal experience, the vast majority of times I've hooked up/met a girl have been without me being 'on the prowl'. It just kinda happens. 




 I'm not sure why I upvoted you, but I did. 




 Good points, I think it's a combination of things. We were totally outplayed by England in that first test and it kinda reminds me of the World Cup.

Australia went into the world cup as strong favourites and we choked up against NZ in the group stage but after that loss we pulled our head in and didn't skip a beat the rest of the entire tourney.

We needed that loss in the first test, we needed to have our hubris broken down for a second so that we could perform to out best.

I don't want to take away from England too much, we know that the team **isnt** that bad, the first test showed what they can do. I just think that Australia changed gears heading into this test.

I agree, let's calm down on the alarmist attitude. It's a damn best of 5 lol

 Oh i have a story for this haha

New years 2011, i was camping with around a dozen of my mates. The countdown had already finished and the night was starting to wind down. A girl at that party had been stood up by a guy she invited up camping. She expressed her frustrations to the group about the guy and openly admitted she was horny as fuck.

She then apparently turned to me and said "ok, im going to my tent, if no one joins me ill just finish myself off and go to bed". Then she got into her tent. I didnt even react and my mates just kinda glared at me like "well? Arent you going to follow her?"

Now i say *apparently* because i was so high that i had no idea she was even in the same timezone as me. So i got told the next morning "dude, why didnt you follow her into her tent? She wanted to bang you".

I was shocked to find out how weed cock blocked me.

Reflection helps combat backsliding. Now i dont recommend this for everyone, but it works for me. I told my friends that they have my blessing to make fun of my fatter self. Go nuts, it helps keep that fat fucker out of my life.

 My bad habit was not flossing.

For 27 years, I had never flossed. By the mercy of a lifetime of flouride infested tap water, I've never had any real dental issues.

I now floss *daily* and I can already tell the difference. My teeth are now nice and white, and my breath has never been fresher. 10/10 would recommend.

 I'm in a similar situation, 45 lbs down, 40 more to go. I'm wondering how I'll see myself in the future. How will I get treated differently? How will my confidence change? 




 At the moment? NONE! I'm in the process of losing weight (45 lbs down :D), and removing alcohol from the equation is one of the main ways to do so, it's been over 4 months and aside from 3 rare land mark occasions (bucks party, friends 30th, visiting a friend interstate) I've not had a sip.

Prior to that? I was drinking most days. Not getting black out drunk every night, but several beers every night. I was going through 1-2 slabs a week easily.

No wonder I was a fatty fatty boomba-laty. 




 I think that's the big one, being good because if you don't then you'll be sent to hell, isn't really *being good*, is it?

I don't murder people because I'm afraid of going to jail if I do. I don't murder people because it's fundamentally wrong.

My secular parents taught me the golden rule, no worship required. 




 I see this often posted on our sister subreddit /r/askwomen, when ever a question is posted as 'females of reddit...' there is quite a bit of backlash as it's considered objectifying. The correct term being 'women of reddit...'

 Saturday Night Live.

After 40 seasons and 787 episodes, you could start at the very begining and watch the entire thing without sleep or rest for the entire 30 days and STILL have more episodes to go.

Plus watching the culture shift from the 70s to the present would be insanely interesting.

 




 That's actually really nice :)

I think it's perfectly reasonable. If you live a good life and do right by your fellow humans, isn't that something that a higher power would want at the end of the day? The fact that some do it without worshiping someone shouldn't matter in the grand scheme of things. 




  I have tried many times to imagine just dying and then not existing. I can't comprehend it. 

Trust me, even the most ardent atheist has the exact same problem trying to comprehend it.

Best way to imagine it? What do you remember about the year 1820? Nothing, because we obviously didn't exist then and it didn't bother us then either.

It's a sobering realisation that in the very likely event that there is no afterlife, that we'll just cease to exist. I can totally see why religion likes to provide hope to quash this perfectly reasonable fear. 




 Something original. Let's hang up the LOTR belt now Peter. Don't do a Silmarillion movie.

 My goal from exercise is fitness over weight loss. I'm losing weight in the kitchen at the moment. 




 ITT: Swooning. So much swooning.

 




 Wow, thanks for taking the time to help me out!

I'd never thought about my progress in context of a marathon before :D

I'm not sure where to go from here to be honest, 4 months ago my plan was to work my way up to a 30 minute jog. Now I need a new goal :) 




 I actually do have a HR monitor. [Heres a report from a workout a few days ago](http://imgur.com/Om0SACh). I sit at around 160ish bpm during my run. 




 Haha, I get what you mean. I mean it, trust me. I'm working my ass off. 




 Is it homophobic because I (straight male) won't date a gay man? You don't make any sense tumblr. 




 So thats irrespective to the speed you're traveling? Because while with controlled breathing i can do my 30 minutes without being heavily out of breathe, i certainly cant hold a conversation during haha 




 Hey guys,

Was looking for some help clarifying the differences between jogging and running.

For context, I'm a 5'9" male and my cardio sessions consist of 30 minutes on a treadmill going 5-5.1 mph. I'm not sure if it fits the definition of jogging or running.  

I guess at the end of the day, who the fuck cares. I'm loving the hell out of my workouts. 




 Your logic is very common, we all see our thin friends eating a burger and think "Oh wow, he/she eats all he/she wants and still stays thin". So we just assume that this is because of some magic condition that they have which you don't.

This of course isn't true, you don't see how much they eat exterior to your viewing of them. 




 Try to work your way up to higher impact stuff. At my heaviest (285 lbs) I would only walk. Now that I'm 45 lbs down, and I've been working my way up to it. I can do 30 minute jogs without pain to my legs and ankles. 

It's all about acclimating your own body. But yeah, time on the bike, swimming or elliptical will help with that. 




 You guys must have different friends than me, we all talk to each other about anything and everything. 

Yes, I would make the comment. 




 I'm an Australian on an American website, don't you think I already know the metric conversions!!! Get outta here bot. 




  he doc told me I could gain about 15 lbs. in water weight

Sweet jesus, you can retain that much? That's insane. So like us camels are. 




 Whose arm is that? I've still got yours right here \ 




 You know how unhealthy it is for you to reply to OPs comment with satire, right?

Don't be an idiot and think of him for a second! 




 The problem is that they don't see your first sentence as correct fundamentally. A hardcore HAES supporter truly believes that being obese has no medical effects on the human body.

There en-lies my problem with the movement, this obvious lie has massive implications to obese people all over the place who believe it.

 HAES sounds like a good concept in principle (accepting your own body), but in practice denying that there is room for improvement is a horrible idea. If taking a flight of stairs makes you puffed out, your reaction shouldn't be "I'm so proud of my out-of-shape-ness", it should be "oh god, it's obvious that I'm not as fit as I used to be, I should work on that". 

That's a truly healthy acceptance of your own body. 




 How do these mother fuckers explain the literal millons of people who are currently losing weight by sustaining a 500 daily calorie deficit? Are they all just magicians? 




 When she broke up with me, I did a burning of the letters and photos. It actually was very cathartic, 10/10 would recommend 




 It's an interesting question. I have a friend, this guy is 5'10" and 240 lbs of muscle, he's massive. Every time we go out, he gets swarmed by women. You constantly see him get felt up by random women who don't ask. It's a rather prevalent double standard, that's for sure. 

Now to your question, do my friends and I do anything about this? Not really. He's mentioned that he likes the attention, but no so much from the older gals, but we're not going to start confronting the women who do this. He's an adult, he if doesn't want the attention, he can speak for himself.

Now reverse the genders here and it seems like a weird thing to consider.



 




 No need to over think it, as long as you're nice to him at family gatherings that's all you need to do. 




 Depends on the obviousness of the flaw, but sure, we notice. Do we care? Unlikely, we all have flaws. Is having stretch marks a deal breaker? Fuck no. 




 After being off the sauce for the past 4 months (for weight loss reasons), my opinion about alcohol has changed fundamentally ever since. Before, I was of the opinion that drinking was important to social situations, but I've since discovered that it's entirely untrue.

What ever the reason for someone being sober, it doesn't bother me what so ever. If you're fun, I'll invite you to shit. 




 I bet you're fun at- Oh wait. 




 \ You dropped this  




 I didnt know you were losing weight with your husband /u/funchords! Nice work to both of you :) 




 As long as you have consent from all parties, best of luck to you.

I personally couldn't do it, I would be a jealous mother fucker. 

My house mate is a bit of a man whore and he does this with around 3-4 women at the moment. It's rather impressive actually. All I can do is plead the 5th if any of the girls ask about the other girls. 




 Haha, I do this now. I now leap up stairs two steps at a time and if it looks like I'm going to miss a set of traffic lights (Happens alot in the city) Ill sprint to make it. 

So much more efficient. 




 I have no idea why I feel so weird doing this. I really don't. There is zero reason you can't see a movie by yourself.

It just feels strange and lame. 




 It's my experience that they're extremely rare. Out of all of my guy friends, only 1 has expressed any wish of having kids. Our average age is around 28 and 4 of them are married. 

Just the sign of a changing time I guess 




 I'm not going to echo what /u/funcords said, because he hit the nail on the head for your weight loss being about diet and not exercise.

But something I will add is about the exercise. It will come in time, trust me. You do need to ease yourself into lest you injure yourself.

I initially started at 285 lbs, which is a little less than you but in the past I've tried to do too much too quickly and I've ended up injuring my knees, ankles or shins. I started small, I did walks. I live right next to a park, so I would just take a long walk and listen to audio books as many times per week as I could. 

Always stretch your major leg muscle groups before and after your workout. And make sure that you have a warm up and cool down. This for me was always just a 5 minute slow walk to warm up and a 5 minute slow walk at the end to cool down.

At that stage, my goal was to eventually be able to go for a run comfortably. I've been slowly adding small bouts of jogging into my workouts over the past 4 months and I've gone from a 45 minute fast walk to a 30 minute solid jog without injury at all. This is in large part to me easing myself into it. If I were in your situation, I would do something similar (work my way from simple, to hard) but I would be more cautious. There is absolutely no shame in holding off starting exercise till you've lose some more weight, you'd be surprised how much easier your body handles exercise after 45 lbs less is on you.

But to reiterate, weight loss is 80% diet. Get that under control and your exercise will follow naturally :)

 




 "Life is too short to always watch what I eat! I'll eat whatever I want!"

Doesn't really make sense when you factor in that **not** watching what you eat makes life even shorter. Besides, you don't have to eat only healthy foods for the rest of your life, that's just fatlogic sour grapes. It's easy to say "I don't want to eat nothing but apples to lose weight", that's just a strawman for weight loss. 




 I feel like reddit is more interested if you're still bros with that guy than if you're still dating that chick.

 




 Sorry I'm late to the party, but hopefully I can help.

If she thinks a persons sexuality is a choice, then ask her why she decided to be straight.

If she says that being straight is natural, remind her that there are hundreds upon hundreds of animal species which regularly engages in gay sex. Google that shit, its fascinating.

Overall, good luck trying to convince her of anything. Chances are that these opinions have been hammered into her since she was young enough to know what the words meant.

 




 I dated a netball player and she was taller than me. It never even crossed my mind. Some people can be rather silly when it comes to this stuff.

Like I get having preferences, but it does seem a little silly when a preference is due to your own insecurity. 




 Oh man, your wife is the real exception. Enjoy your unicorn :D 




 Damnit, I was here to make that joke. I guess we're cyster sisters. 




 Perfectly fine, I had a first date where we were just meant to meet up for coffee, but after a few hours of holding our now empty coffee cups at the cafe, we decided to go for a walk around the park near by.

It was really nice, plenty of fresh air and since it was a Sunday there was lots going on at the park, which helped the conversation move along well.

I had no idea I knew so many anecdotes about frisbees. 




 "Ill get this one, you can get the next :)"

It's that easy. 




 Hand shakes if you just met them, and a hug or a kiss on the cheek or a combination.

Depends on the person, but who cares they're likely not overthinking it like us. 




 Nice one man, I remember being in your position as a graduate quite a few years ago. Be glad that you found a job, it's tough right out of tertiary.

Don't worry, you'll get plenty of on the job training and try to remember as much about project management that you learned in your studies! That comes in handy more than any programming knowledge :)
