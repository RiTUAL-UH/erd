 My wife and I have been together for 10 years. She has always had some social anxiety, flashes of generalized anxiety here or there that Ive seen in manifest in different ways over the years but nothing like this.  Shes barely functioning. She wont go to therapy, she wont go to a doctor, she just flat refuses. She barely leaves the house, she wont talk to virtually anyone but me.  Every single thing I say or do that refers to her depression just feeds into her guilt and anxiety. So all Im left with is pretending that things are normal.  Even that has become a weight I have to carry, I cant talk to her about what Im feeling because it feeds her guilt, I cant talk to anyone else because she feels exposed and it feeds her shame

She quit her job to go back to school a few years ago. Shes smart and hard working and put in a couple years at a JC and was offered a scholarship to a really good school. First year at the university she KILLED it. 4.0 GPA  fast forward to now, I thought that she was still managing school, that in spite of everything, she knew how important it is and was making do. I discovered that shes on the verge of failing out of school and hiding it from me; It really knocked the wind out of me.  More the deception more than anything else, weve always communicated very openly with each other. I havent told her that I know because Im afraid of how she will respond. If I casually mention school she deflects, Im dreading the end of the summer.

Ive read that people whos partners are depressed are much more prone to depression themselves I think Im there.  I feel like Ive been carrying us both for so long.  Months of worrying about her, of struggling every day, just trying to trudge ahead, forcing myself, sometimes successfully sometimes not, to do things that reinforce the positive.  Everyday things that used to roll off my back bring me to verge of tears some days. Ive always been a very reflective person. Now I walk into work hoping to be overwhelmed so I dont have time to think about anything but Im short with people and cant think as clearly as Im used to. Im fighting in every way I know how but cant get passed the feeling that its all slipping away. I just feel so lonely carrying it all by myself.
 




 OUTSTANDING. THANKS! 




 love this. 

Request: the scene in they live where he puts the glasses on for the first time and looks up and the billboard.  I gave it a shot but it is beyond my ability.

 if you go to the Visbubble directory (something like documents\rainmeter\skins\visbubble) there is a settings file where you can change the size,color, number of bars, how far the bars extrude, etc. 




 Loved that card. I just upgraded (295x2), now my wife loves that card.  




 exactly. This is some opportunistic bullshit. The regulatory state? Really? Fuck George Will right in his ear.  




 if i remember right those are from the Enigma taskbar 




 At work now but I will get the links up after.

 came here looking for this exact thing.  much appreciated. 




 riiiiiiiight 




 it's cake.  




 Yup. 
"If you run into an asshole in the morning, you ran into an asshole. If you run into assholes all day, you're the asshole."  Wisdom from Raylan Givens 




 holy shit, I completely forgot about this movie.  Six-String Samurai is totally happening tonight.  




 Steams family share system is pretty bad. Since no one can play anything in my library while i am playing anything else in my library, Elite being separate from Steam gives me more flexibility. 




 yeah, it's a little messy i know.  The company i work for does home theater installation and even with the high end media servers it's not much cleaner than that.  




 i've been converting some of my dvd collection lately.  I run [anyDVD HD](http://www.slysoft.com/en/anydvd.html) then rip with [makeMKV](http://www.makemkv.com/download/) and convert to mp4 with [handbrake](https://handbrake.fr/).

i've had some funky outcomes with newer DVDs when ripping straight to mp4 with handbreak. That why i use makeMKV, if it's older stuff though you could skip the middle makeMKV step.

 




 not to be nitpicky but, comma?

 i remember reading an interview with him somewhere where he said he just says yes to everything. The idea being that he knows it means a ton of crap is going to get made, but there will be a gem here or there that never would have happened otherwise.  




 Dean Baker is my snarky economist hero. 




 Just a beautiful, brilliant woman who is my age effortlessly articulating really thoughtful, smart things about some of my favorite topics... no big deal 




 Great, now i have to get divorced.  Thanks.

 




 i didn't like it at first but it grew on me in a hurry.  i prefer it to the 360 controller now. 




 this is awesome.  I've been working towards something like it off and on for a while this but it never quite feels right.  




 underrated movie.  




  I like the dock. Its nice to have extra usb ports and an Ethernet port and I run a display port hub off of it to run 4 total displays. Its super easy to switch and the transition between modes is seamless. Its awesome, really.  That being said, its not necessary at all. I could see If I worked from home or used my surface as my primary pc for work  in some other capacity and wanted to have a full workstation setup all the time so I could just connect and keep moving. In that case the dock is clutch, totally worth $200 bucks.   But for me,  even having that capability; 4 monitors, printer, full size keyboard/mouse, hardwired Ethernet, and external hard drive ready to roll all the time,  I almost never use it that way, I mentally shrug when I think of taking it out of the cover to attach it  and then sit down on the couch.  

Most would be fine with a 10 dollar mini display dongle. 

Disclaimer: i have a nice gaming PC that provides a strong disincentive to use the surface for anything other than mobile/tablet functions.   




 Then you're well-intentioned but misguided.  




 Trying reading it horizontally and doing actual analysis.  Just reading through it and highlighting the bronze age shit that looks fucked up to your 21st century world view is dickish and not helpful.

 Karen Armstrong is pretty good. The psychology of religious extremism is a thread that runs through alot of her work so there are a few books that would be applicable.  

Check out Fields of Blood: Religion and the History of Violence.  




 TNC is awesome.  I know what you mean about his writing getting away from him but if it didn't he wouldn't be so good.  




 i feel like old, bloated Tim Curry would only make Pennywise creepier.
