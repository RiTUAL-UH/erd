 You are correct. I wish I could, but titles can't be edited. You are free to edit "emobsymbiotically" to "embosymbiotically" though, if you want. 




 Slightly OT: How do you land the stunt jump from that ramp? I gave up.

 I realize this isn't /r/science but I'm gonna put the peer-reviewed study here:

[Imitation Improves Language Comprehension](http://pss.sagepub.com/content/21/12/1903) 



















 From the source:
 Serge Abrahamovitch Voronoff (Russian:   ; c. July 10, 1866  September 3, 1951) was a French surgeon of Russian extraction who gained fame for his technique of grafting monkey testicle tissue on to the testicles of men for purportedly therapeutic purposes while working in France in the 1920s and 1930s. 

(edit) and:

 By the early 1930s, over 500 men had been treated in France by his rejuvenation technique, and thousands more around the world, such as in a special clinic set up in Algiers.[15] Noteworthy people who had the surgery included Harold McCormick, chairman of the board of International Harvester Company. 









 I choose to believe that about half way through, mother duck realized that those guys were helping.

 Post a study with its real title in a peer-reviewed journal and it will get *buried* on /r/science, it's just the way the world works.
 




 Look, I don't see anything in common between the official [Rules of submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/wiki/rules#wiki_submission_rules) and what /u/nallen has written at the top of this post.

As an avid reader and frequent submitter to this sub I want to know what the rules are.
 




 OK so make the rules unambiguous then. It *still* says, in the post:

 linking to a page that contains a video is not allowed.

I'm not being pedantic on purpose, but rules are rules, let us know what they are, and we will follow them. 




 I'm sorry but this is simply false. Here is the text of the new rules:

 (since we don't allow videos, linking to a page that contains a video is not allowed.)

either you need to edit it or explain why we can't post links that contain videos. 









 It has always been like this. Or at least since I have been on /r/science. The top comments are always variations of these themes:

- "There is nothing new about this. This has been known for some time."

- "Correlation does not imply causation"

- "Sensationalized clickbait title"

Most of the meaningful discussion happens when you scroll down. 




 I agree but sometimes a truly interesting study that belongs here is the meat behind a garbage title.  




 Quite a few headlines in science stories from the mainstream press would violate these rules. So if someone wants to post to /r/science they should adjust them accordingly, rather than use the same headline verbatim? (I agree with the notion, for the record.) 




 Here's the full study in Lancet Psychiatry:

 Some people like to quote this story as evidence that everything is determined by your DNA. It's a great story but whenever this comes up I'm reminded of the [Texas sharpshooter fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_sharpshooter_fallacy).  Our genomes can predict what happens to us a lot, sure, but a lot of the other coincidences about names etc. came by chance. Indeed, the new field of epigenetics shows that DNA is *not* necessarily your destiny.

 Not at all. I'm quite sure all of these things were taken into account, that's what a study like this does. It would not be accepted in such a journal as PNAS without doing so.  




 90's were best 's 




 Shh, don't say that, the mods are strict here and this is a great post. 









 I'm glad someone else noticed this, I can't think of any other explanation. If anyone is interested I posted about it elsewhere ITT but it was downvoted. It is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3ccozd/women_have_not_always_lived_longer_than_men_the/csuh6e1) 




 There's a lot of nonsense in this thread about maternal mortality and war, but if you read [the authors' own abstract](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/07/01/1421942112), it's very interesting that they seem to attribute the "mortality gap" to a reduction in infectious disease death rates. We all know that antibiotics have had a profound affect on health:

 The remaining excess male mortality may be explained by underlying traits of vulnerability to cardiovascular disease that emerged with the reduction of infections and changes in diet and other lifestyle factors. 

In other words, infectious diseases killed men and women equally prior to the 20th century, but since then, people lived long enough for the lifestyle factors of men relative to women to make a difference in mortality rates in middle age and beyond. 




 It looks like there may well be some indication of what you are talking about in this study's data. The first figure in OP's article (not the one with the US soccer team) shows a strange outlier of more men than women people dying in their early 40s, say 40 to 45, who were born from 1860 to 1879, compared to the other age cohorts. It's the dark blue part of the graph, and stands out quite a bit.

People who were born from 1860 to 1879 were 40 to 45 from 1900 to 1924. i.e. a large proportion of them were those ages during World War I. Given that we know WWI was catastrophically deadly, and that men were presumably fighting at or over age 40, *and* that this study used data from people in developed countries, I would not be surprised if that dark blue outlier in the chart is an artifact of World War I.

It may be addressed in actual paper, but I don't have access to it right now (paywalled). 




 *Sigh*

Look at the figure in this write-up of the paper - access to the paper itself isn't needed, it is paywalled. The values on the y axis are the male-to-female mortality rate ratios amongst various cohorts for deaths from age 60 to 90 **at those ages**.

Let's take the age 60 for example, as the text does. It clearly shows that a greater ratio of men to women die **at age 60** for those born from 1900-1935 (red and pale blue) than those born from 1800-1839 (grey and black).

This data has nothing to do with life expectancies **at birth**, which I agree, would be skewed by maternal mortality rates.

 Title says it all really, I've never played any of them. 









  researchers tested the testosterone levels of the indigenous Tsimane people in central Bolivia before and after they cut down trees. Their results showed a 46.8 percent increase in testosterone levels following the wood cutting, a full 17 percent higher than the testosterone bump caused by playing soccer.

This is a fascinating study for sure, and no offence to the Tsimane people, but it would be really interesting if the results also apply to people in the developed world.
