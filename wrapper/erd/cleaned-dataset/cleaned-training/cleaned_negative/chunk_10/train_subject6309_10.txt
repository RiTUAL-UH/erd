 I dream of being able of turning my house into a haunted house every year. How much do you think a transformation like this would cost? 



















 Yay! I'm glad that I'm not the only one who is terrified of Monstro ! 




 Very interesting, I'm not sure if it's creepy worthy however. 




 Definitely odd, but not creepy.  




 Hey fellow teachers, In August I will be teaching at a new school(7-12). The current Language Arts teacher is very, very into ECAR(every child a reader) and ECAW(every child a writer). I have done a little research into this program, and it seems to be geared towards elementary age kids, not middle school(what I teach). I am very hesitant to adopt this new teaching program. Any thoughts out there? Are there benefits? 




 Just love Ol' Blue Eyes!!
