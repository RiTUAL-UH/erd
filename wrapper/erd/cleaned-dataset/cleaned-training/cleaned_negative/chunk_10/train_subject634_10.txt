 For me the movie I love but everyone else hates is Spiderman 3. Yes, it has its faults, but I still thought it was a decent entry to the Tobey trilogy. I just think everyone had really high expectations for this one after the masterpiece that was the 2nd.

The movie I can't stand but everyone seems to love is Django Unchained. I thought at this point in time and through all his previous films over the years, the good ol' Tarantino formula and style began to wore out on me. 




 Watch any Sako match with Skisonic commentating and you will understand. 




 I was one of the very few people that voted Gamerbee to win Evo. So close :( 




 At least Daigo lost to the best juri player in the world/japan. 




 Damn imagine how Gamerbee would feel if he got 2nd place at Capcom Cup. 




 Daigo didn't even played badly. Ai Ai Juri play was beyond insane and thoroughly outplayed him. So happy he won and made top 8 at EVO. I hope to see him appear future tournaments to come. 

The saddening thing was Daigo even admitted before Evo he was scared of him because of Ultra 1 so he should've used another character. Again Daigo's biggest weakness of his pride when it comes to counter-picking is shown here. I hope him watching Top 8 EVO makes him realise this. 




 Who are toughest players you've versed in Ultra Sf4? 




 Wasn't this the first time Gamerbee has ever beaten Infiltration at a tournament? Alongside with Daigo, Infiltration was also Gamerbee's demon. 




 Sorry! I just added it :)

 [](/Kappa) 




 Amazing Ultra got the most views considering it was very late at night for other parts of the world. 




 The top 10 list on CPT points standing looks perfectly accurate for the ten best players in the world right now. 




 Gamerbee came 2nd also in EVO 2012. Heartbreaking for him to get runner up again after all that work.
