 I love having beer or two after my workout. What effect is this having on my recovery process?

Simply put, after I workout I go to the pub next to the gym and eat usually 2 chicken breasts and either some salad or rice. Usually washed down with a couple of pints of a decent craft beer. 

I do have a protein shake pre-workout
