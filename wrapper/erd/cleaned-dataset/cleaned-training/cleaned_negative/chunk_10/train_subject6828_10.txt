 Going after a [Best Picture, huh](http://i.imgur.com/kiru8Fa.jpg)? 




 I gotta go rewatch this. Saw it in theaters but I like me my subtitles. 




 For me it's The Dark Knight rises- Christopher Nolan. (Still better than Man of Steel) 









 Plus, you could use this to have them accidentally attack a family member. 




 3) "Lieutenant Dan, ice cream. Lieutenant Dan?"

2) " I'm pretty tired...I think I'll go home now."

1) "I thought I'd try out my sea legs."

"But you ain't got no legs lieutenant dan."

"Yes...I know that."



Forgive the mistakes this is from memory and I seem to have misplaced my internet. 




 It was a fun movie with a fresh concept and art house direction. 




 My favorite Brian Brushwood video: [Mexican Race War](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1iSiTMjQmM t=7m10s). 




 Have not seen Brazil. Have heard the ending in this subreddit 2+ times this week. 




 I agree, I also like all the scenes that precede this scene. 




 I didn't realise I was getting downvoted. Noted. 




 Gone Girl. 


I haven't read the book. I'm just fascinated when [a ](#s "character intricately weaves together a diabolical plan that satisfied her need for revenge and gave her a happy ending") 




 Good choice.  









 Hoping for that 4-hour Joss Whedon cut.


Still haven't see the movie. 




 Moon and Hangover. 


I had the pleasure to work in the theater during their run. Also The Hurt Locker. 




 Sometimes when I'm watching a movie, if it's really good I don't want it to end. 




 Firefly 




 So how's your sex life? 




 The second viewing caught me off guard. I would laugh at stuff I didn't laugh at before. 




 Kidnapped(Sequestrados). It's on US netflix. It was mentioned a few days back in a list but no one had seen it. The movie is tense and consists wholly of a few (6) tracking shots during it's entirety. 




 Go on... 




 Especially with nobody at the wheel. 




 I don't know what to believe anymore. 




 What about leaving change in a tip jar? 




 Been there. Just praying for each following block. 









 I would see the trailer for it. 




 How could I "DIY" this? 




 Sorry, mobile. 




 Elon Musk and Steven Spielberg were looking to get their hands on the game. 




  I joined just before this E3 to see if there'd be a release date. Stayed since you guys are mostly alright. 




 *NMS 




 Looks like a mix of Elite squad and blow. 




 [Good thing his penis was big enough to tell she was a man.](http://imgur.com/YcooD33) 




 sounds like a Nip/Tuck subplot. 




 Cool. Coolcoolcool. 




 Your references are outta control. 




 Bet on black. 




 Inspiration hits me at any time and it can be tempting to follow it. However that could be a subconscious attempt to have you quit on a current project. I just write down what hits me and put it away to get back to later. This helps create perespective. it might be a great idea but you might have learned something about yourself or the idea that forces you to consider whether to venture writing it. For example, last night I was watching an alien b-movie and I thought " I could do this better. This movie is sending a message about the war in the middle east but the dialogue is atrocious. If I were to do this...". So after fleshing out an idea, I put it away because pursuing it would take away my concentration from the first project.

  Firefly

FTFY: Serenity 




 I'd like to read it...maybe. 









 This series should end with Tudyk and Fillion laying by the poolside and have an exchange like this: 

T: So, I hear Spectrum might come back soon.

N: Really? 

T: No, not really. That would be like Firefly coming back. 




 He was also in the rules of attraction as Patrick Bateman. 




 How could I fix the first issue? I'm on Celtx.


The judge was addressing someone offscreen. I was implying a society of rapid fire type trials. 




 Consider the footage we've seen. Hundreds of Npc's in the most far reaching worlds. I'd be doing barrel rolls all day. 




 Fun way to get a bit of [feedback](https://www.scribd.com/doc/270998430/Soul). 




 Honestly I prefer characters to stay quiet instead of firing off one liners. ^Terminator ^^Genisys 




 I disagree.  18 "quintillion" planet seems to be a one galaxy figure. If I were to decipher,  I'd guess you get launched back to the edge of the galaxy but an area opposite of your starting point. 




 "The maniac is in the mailbox." 




 Swing loooow... 




 ... 




 *Pukes 




 Happen**e**d. Just say occurred goddamn it.  




 In most cases... 




 I just write on my spare time. I stay subscribed for posts like this. 




 *sigh.... 




 You can't take the sky from me!!! 




 AAAAnd now you've reminded my of the new [Hitman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7X8fCUMMVM) movie.  




 Wrait 




 He's about as close to a real life Rayland Givens as I could hope to get. 




 Come on, you apes, do you wanna live forever?! 









 I just want a date I can mark on my figurative calendar. 




 There are ninja schools. However if you can find one, you shouldn't attend it. 




 Your facts make me sad. 









 Dude but honestly how awesome would that be! 




 [Relevant.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw2sex1mJNI) 




 I suppose there's always space battles and barren planets could be good for mining. 




 He looks like the game developer from the penultimate season of Dexter.  




 But will we see him pee? 




 In the GI cover of NMS they said you could see a ship fly by and that might be an npc or a player. He went on to make the point that that's how you see what your avatar looks like.  When did this change? 









 Fallout shelter, IOS app 




 It's up to me to hold back the forces of the darkn-...what's everyone doing? Is this a...I can kic- oooh yay!!! 




 Can't believe this is a thing. 




 X-wings, Y-wings and tie fighters on hoth? 




 I had heard not. 




 If only it weren't your friend. 




 I don't understand this reference. 




 If you spend a day there, humanity becomes extinct. 




 I take it you disagree.

 Where did Wolfgang get a bazooka?  




 Every game nowadays needs a zombie level, lets see how this works out for them. 




 **Looks around**

 What's my last name!? 




 Argh, you all wouldn't be alive if it waahsn't for my DaviiD! 




 GAME OVER, MAN!

"No, you sleep with her"


 




 While I'm glad to see activity on this sub, your post is really vague.  Are you looking for equipment,  funding or talent? What is it that you're trying to communicate? 

Multiple edits: Mobile spelling. 




 Well maybe you need to stop talking to me. 




 The "E" stands for Evil. 




 =D I am smiling warmly. I wish all the best for his future. 




 I like everyone over you. 




 Hyenas, the world would be tormented by these beasts, not to mention a now significantly bigger clitoral explosion.  




 In the city people wear suits all the time, however they're usually walking next to a guy wearing a "Y U NO LOVE ME" shirt.

 




 No? ^have ^mercy 




 There are dozens of us. 




 Stupid Geneva conventions, rules are meant to be broken. 




 Every goddamn game that comes out nowadays needs to have a zombie level. 









 I just saw it, this movie was pleasantly surprising. I give it props for the realistic deaths which added to the tension. I also liked not knowing wtf was to happen next. 




 For example: The Matrix films are live action but the Animatrix is animated. 




 I hate your kind. I consider your type "Roose Boltons." Evil and Opportunistic. 




 Didn't you get the memo? 




 I thought he killed it, wonderful to be bold while maintaining hilarity.
