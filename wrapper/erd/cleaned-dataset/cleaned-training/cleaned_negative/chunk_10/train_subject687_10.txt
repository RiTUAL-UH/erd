 The professional diver tried to dive into the tiny pool two miles below, but missed the center a hit his head on a corner. 




 {:'-D 




 No 




 I crashed {:'-D 




 Ooops 




 It's too late now {:'-D 




 OH GOD!! D: EMERGENCY!! EMERGENCY!!!!!!!!!!!! {:'-D 




 Do people meet up to play, or like how do they play? 




 How is that possible!? 









 Correct 









 Thanks :) 




 What are those tournaments about? 




 Well, it still exists... but it's not in use ;) 




 I can't XD 









 Maybe we should ask the other mods to see how we could modify the sub? 




 Yep... we gotta find someone who is good with CSS... i'm a noob... lol 




 In the future, we might get someone to make the button blue so it is more visible :) 




 But does it turn black when you click it? 




 Maybe... I tried posting a link to this sub at /r/ButtonAftermath to see if the people left there might be interested? 




 I'm still trying to see what I can do to make the community grow... we might still have a chance. 




 I guess you're right... I was too quick to judge. 









 Even /r/buttonaftermath is nearly abandoned now... 




 That's the most twisted individual I have heard of yet, I mean, what kind of person with a good life does that? Dammmmmm 




 Happy birthday ;)

p.s. A day late, but better late then never! ;) 




 Because each second that passes, it leads closer to my death. 




 Yep. 









 I agree... quite an offensive word, eh? 




 Oh, it truly is! 




 Nah... I think people consider it a phrase, so it's probably not on the dictionary... 




 You're welcome. 




 HarRrdee harRr harRr ;-) 




 Excellent choice. 









 Diarrhea   




 Suck... even babies can do that. 




 ...She wants to be your cook now. 




 /r/NoMoreSAT 




 Honestly the graders might give it like around a 9-11, though it deserves a 12 due to the very short time they give.

Don't you wish students didn't have to go through this?

/r/NoMoreSAT 




 I am quite offended by this comment. 




 {:'-D 




 Communism. 




 What quality food do they eat? 




 What do you think? 




 ...She wants your eggroll. 









 {:'-D 














 I'm just gonna remove this post to prevent lots of other people asking for mod-position...  we wouldn't want it to end up like /r/moderatorium... lol 









 LOL... the lunch-lady has no guts to stand up for herself. 




 Rollercoaster 




 Doot Doot 




 :)

 ELI5, I5 TH4T Y0U??? 




 Oh very yes. 




 You'll get the invitation soon... 




 Hey, for the lunch-lady sub, does mod# matter or just as long as you're a mod? 




 Don't worry, if anyone demods anyone, they'll be demodded and you'll get re-invited :) 









 {:'-D 









 Do you really want to be 2nd/3rd or it doesn't really matter as long as you get mod? 




 Interesting... 




 Disaster 




 {:'-D 




 Ohhh I just swallowed my pen, ohh ohh... :( 




 Woah! :D 




 3 




 Hey, what's up 




 Oh I see... someone de-modded you but it wasn't me... I promise. It was u/18custodioj	 who de-modded a bunch of people. Don't worry though...  I invited  you to mod again. 




 I can't... I can't access the sub. Someone messed it up :( 




 I don't... please tell me. Is it because of the sub? 




 Dude, you're famous at /r/moderatorium, congratz :) 




 This is serious though... I'm not even joking. 




 ...she has fallen and is screaming "MAHMAHHHH!"

*p.s. She needs help* 




 ...she wants your DNA son. 




 ...she wants you man. 




 ...she wants to go out to lunch with you bro. 




 ...she misses you. 




 I may act like a fool at times, but that's just to take my focus away from the true horror. 




 Trust me... it's far worse than what /u/20141220 predicted. The moon and water will turn to blood, the government will become worse than the Nazis, millions will starve to death, the sun shall burn the skin, and eventually the world will be covered in flames. This is no ARG my friends, this is real. No one knows when this tribulation will start, but it could start any time. 

**EDIT:** [PROOF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_Moon_Prophecy)
 




 Jeevees 




 Great idea.. lol... i'll think it through for a while... lol 




 Thanks :) any ideas on how I should decide who gets modded first? lol 




 Alright, but with restricted permissions :)

I just gotta find a way to chose who goes on top of who...

I just gotta find a way to chose who goes on top of who... 




 Why? 




 Thank you, dear friend :) 




 It's not my mom, it's some other lady. 




 Cool :) 




 ... she misses you. 




 That's great :) 




 Anyone else out there??? {:'-D 









 Actually, some people think i'm a god... 




 {:'-D 




 Why? 



















 Add to reduce, reduce to deduce. 




 Oh thank you so much. 




 Maybe... 




 I'll be dead by then man. 




 But most likely we won't survive. 




 Maybe... 




 My subreddit is

/r/TheLunchLadyCalled

There are a bit of things i'd like to fix:

1. The name of the sub to appear on the header, without it being an uploaded picture

2. The text in the red and purple submit boxes to be aligned in the middle

3. The "mail icon" to stop being a green box and actually be a mail icon


Thanks so much, and I appreciate any help. 




 Sadly we were left behind... the truth is... we're all going to die :( 




 Correct... the world has no idea of the horrors that await in the near future... 




 Am I in danger? :D 




 CONFIRMED :) 




 /r/april30th2016 is in distress :O 




 You deserve to know. 









 What do you believe his name will be? 




 Maths will need us :) 




 /u/20141220? 




 Mistake...

 4x4=8

4x4=16 in 16 years it'll be 2031. world ending 2031 confirmed :) 




 Woah... awesomeness :D 




 Nope, you're quite normal. 









 {:'-D 




 Oh yeah... nice idea :) 




 Yes, he violated the cow's b-hole... haven't you heard of that story? 




 Yeah, the internet went down in my area and certain lights stopped working... *it is happening slowly* 




 CONFIRMED 




 Any plans? 




 The witch will stink for eternity... 




 It has to be dirty too :) 




 The ghost who has never showered since birth... LOL 




 "I feel as though I have written this myself."

It just won't go away! 




 Nope 




 In that case... that hole should be ripped ;)
