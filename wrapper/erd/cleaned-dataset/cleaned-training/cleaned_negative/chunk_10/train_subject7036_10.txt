 Its out. At least it is in most territories. Kevin Parker was in this band for a bit as a drummer. He produces a lot of their stuff still I believe. 




 Vodka with the zest to remove bacteria before dry hopping. 24 hours should do.  




 That's correct! 














 Wow. Very cool 




 straight to bottles. no keg involved at all. We poured the beers into cups. Some people drank from bottles and were ok.

 That was my personal fave. Creamy mouthfeel and tons of balanced orange flavor. Thanks for the high praise! You are right. Many of our guests are not used to brews like that nor were we familiar with brewing fruit based beers. Can't say that anymore! 




 Killer! 1 gallon will always sound like a lot to me.  




 A perfect summer [stout](http://www.brewersfriend.com/homebrew/recipe/view/13843/chocolate-mint-stout) It was very popular.

 Orange IPA, Blueberry Pale Ale, Mint Chocolate Stout, Cinnamon Vanilla Cider. Everyone had their favorites but all the beers went in the end. Throwing a party with your own beer is leagues better than buying! 









 its always high tide 




 i haven't laughed out loud at a reddit post in a while. This did it. 




 Record of the year for me

 Hey Mr. McKellen. Huge fan! What have you changed the most about how you approach a role over your 50 years of acting (if anything at all)? Also, favorite type of cereal? I am a honey-nut cheerio type of guy myself.

 I love eggplant parm. I knew I was voting for the right guy.  




 right now a lot of positive comments are floating at the top.  




 no worries. The [cover](http://esq.h-cdn.co/assets/15/27/1435774434-kim-kardashian-for-rolling-stone-magazine-bellanaija-july2015.jpeg) of this issue has Kim Kardashian in a super hero outfit and nine pages of virtual nothingness. Preceding this journalistic masterpiece is the 'Weekend With Bernie' piece. I do think this issue will sell and more people can see whats up.   




 thanks! Couldn't find it and thought it was a print exclusive. Now linked above.  




 Print only. Gotta keep some stuff exclusive or saps like me won't pay them. 

edit: I stand corrected. Please see link above! 




 Doesn't matter - sarcasm or not! We believe differently here. This is a pro-Bernie sub and in our hearts and minds he will get the nomination. We are not fighting an educational campaign - we are fighting to win. Bernie's words not mine.  




 edit: Was on mobile and couldn't find the read. [Here](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/weekend-with-bernie-sanders-20150709) it is! Thanks, u/F0reverlad 




 Damn. Looks like that $10 computer I made is fucked.
