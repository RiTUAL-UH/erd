 I honestly don't know where to share it.  I was hoping it would turn into a discussion about bias journalism. I tried to post to politics.  So I have a message to a mod out right now to hopefully help me.   




 Sorry I thought I had to post the title exactly how it comes up(as ridiculous clickbait as it is), like in the politics sub.  It's just extreme right-wing bs. 

I just like to share what facebook passes around sometimes, because I like to have discussions about it.   




 This is going around facebook today 









 Oh wow, interesting. Never knew that 




 What exactly is tahini?  I have had homemade hummus and I prefer it over store bought.  I don't feel like i taste too many flavors in it though, is it mild? 




 That whole movie made me depressed.  I kept thinking it would turn around, then it just ended.  




 Why is it impossible to send an unmanned vessel down there and get answers?  

James Cameron funded the one-man submersible that had to be strong enough to sustain a human life,  can't we make it much deeper if we didn't have that to worry about?   




 Great song.  But I get this inexplicable grand mal cringe going every time I hear it mentioned.

 When the song first came out, all I saw was that video everywhere.  I thought that was Gotye. 




 Mc Paul Barman? 




 Oh no.  Alright, thanks.

 ...is not irrelevant, but the murders *are* 3 years old.  




 The best Lonely Island song ever.  




 So freaking cute 




 I feel like this is an important point.  One of the main problems with giving them too much water is that it inhibits the absorption of nutrients of formula/breastmilk.  They might act thirsty and drink it, but then there's no room for what they need.  Listen to your Dr, but I personally would just wait.  




 Would you want to do that to yourself?  Or your gf? 
Why stick around only to not be completely satisfied and possibly make someone else miserable in the process?

So yea Ewg I guess. Thank you for responding 




 I'm sure it's not the best, because more natural is the way to go.  But people are saying it burns your skin, and it has an overload of vitamin a that causes cancer.  I can post the articles in question, just wasn't sure if it was allowed.

I buy the baby neutrogena for my child and I'm just curious of the science of it all. 




 Well see, I paid a lady to do it for me because I didn't trust myself to do the kit that well. But now that I see the process, I'm sure I could handle it on my own. I don't think she used anything too different than what you could obtain at a Michael's store. 




 So the mixture starts out looking like a shake.  When it gets to a certain consistency, she sticks her hand in for about 45 seconds, and it goes from shake texture to feeling like a stable Gak.  Once the Gak feels stable, she wiggles her hand out, then the mold is ready for the plaster.  Then the plaster is poured in until it dries, and you peel the Gak away, and ta da! 




 This has to be the prettiest picture I've seen of her. 




 They sell DIY stuff at Michael's. I paid a lady to do it for me, so I'm not sure of the specifics of the process.  




 I've never done anything like that before, so I wasn't sure it would turn out good.  But the lady told me that the gel mold dries in like 45 seconds, and whatever position her hand is in last second, that's what it will be. It's pretty cool.  









 I was just fixing of the hot avocado problem.  The whole thing isn't a winning idea. 




 You will never win an argument with an ignorant person. 




 Yea, how about scoop the *whole* avocado out, cook the egg, then layer it all back on top of egg.  




 You're like, Oprah. Seriously, never change.  




 Best feeling!  My 5 month old just started cracking up when I do raspberries on her tummy. 




 The new one looks terrible. 




 Fuck, that makes it more terrifying. 




 [People Are Strange by Echo And The Bunneymen](https://youtu.be/yUgRSmo50gE) 




 Adorable little face 




 I somewhat agree, although my brain doesn't possess the capability of coming up with anything any better. 




 My baby is still very young and hasn't quite had all the vaccines yet.  I live in a state of worry that one of these crazy fucks will be the reason she gets sick one day.  Oh, they will rue the day.  




 I thought he was pretty funny in The Rocker, his line delivery was great.  I'm rooting for him too. 




 That scared the living shit out of me when I first saw it.  




 My LO is only about 5 months and she shudders randomly.  Might not be for the same reason yours does, but I found it odd.  




 I'm sorry  




 I just learned a new word. 




 If 99% of the time you use a diaper, is there always someone to change you?  

Do you also like people to feed you, or bathe you? Do you watch cartoons? 




 Great movie,  I agree. 




 I just watched this for the first time, that main character fucking kills it dude, why isn't he in more shit?? 




 It happens fast too, I had gotten a secured card and 2-3 months later my credit had already improved enough to get approved for other credit cards.   




 Yea, I'm picturing the majority of the 90's pretty colorless.  




 [what](http://www.imgur.com/Cqx6wSc.gif) 




 Dude, yes. They added this to amazon video, I told myself I had to watch it but never did.  




 Yea, fuck them the most.

 Everyone I know right now that has a baby, doesn't breast feed.  They have their reasons to use formula, but that has to be a major portion of $12,000.     




 Maybe find somebody who's pregnant, like in Juno?   




 I'm honestly just learning about my car, and I really got excited that (I thought) I knew something.   




 Nope nope, sorry, I was thinking blend door actuators. 




 My door actuators are behind my dash and glove box.  




 Well yea, that is completely different. Too bad. 




 Because he didn't *actually* ask for upvotes, I think it's pretty fucked up to remove this and inhibit the message from spreading.  I feel he literally does want the message spread.

Edit: You Fucker, he *did* specifically ask for upvotes. 




 What exactly happened for you to do this?  




 *Yea, they sound like great people doing great work. It's a shame OP left before it got any more awesome.* 




 Why did that all stop? 




 Really?  I did not know that.  




 I know, my fingers are crossed, *don't fuck it up.* 




 "The human equivalent of gas station sushi." - Leslie Knope 




 Fiesta Sunrise was my favorite episode.  The owner was so stupid, that place was completely doomed.  




 I respect that.  




 That terrified me at first. 




 [3 Shades of Black](https://youtu.be/GkzSyvCl9ic) is the shit. 




 It's so easy to do that when their hands are so tiny!  

It gets easier.  I only do hers while she's asleep.  I hold the finger and pull the skin away from nail gently to make a better gap for clippers.  I tried the filing, but it just never did enough for me.  




 It really only works if you have a decent file.  You will just waste time with the cardboard ones.

It's to use on babies.  I never thought I'd own one, but it works very well.  The first few weeks of life babies only breathe through their nose, so it's important to have a tool that works.  









 I really liked how dark all of the murder scenes were, and that there was a calmness about them that was so different than a lot of movies, I appreciated it. But I completely agree about Mr. Boogie.  Have you even seen the trailer for [Sinister 2](https://youtu.be/fChx_YZUAR0)? It's almost like they magnified the few things that were bad about the first movie.   




 Life skills in general.  A lot of people say finances, I say general knowledge about house maintenance.  I'm still learning things about my house that need to be done 4 years after buying it.   

I also think autoshop should be available in more schools, people shouldn't be in the dark about how their cars work. 




 I was recently watching some live videos of theirs on youtube, holy shit were they bad. I would not have guessed it, it's too bad. 




 I still haven't committed to watching Amelie.  What is your critique on that?  




 Young Adult.  There is something soothing and addicting about Charlize Theron playing a bratty, naive woman.   




 I think it's crazy they are against dancing.  




 I still enjoy Bubble Bobble from Nintendo. I always try to download it to my different phones or computers, very fun. 




 What did you think of Sinister? I enjoyed it.  The next one looks pretty bad, in my opinion. 




 Thank you for making me laugh,  I was feeling a little down.  




 It's almost *tangy*, or sour. Chocolate shouldn't taste tangy, that's why I don't eat Hershey's. Not because of what reddit thinks.  




 I once read that humans are meant to carry babies longer than we do,  but our body's can't handle a longer pregnancy.  Can anyone expand on that?  




 It's very soothing.  I didn't grow up knowing it on the radio, that might make me feel differently, but I like it a lot.  




 [Ah yes.](http://www.imgur.com/RoiiOSM.jpeg) 




 Iron Maiden does a great cover of a Sabbath Bloody Sabbath  




 Nice 




 [Somebody That I Used To Know](https://youtu.be/8UVNT4wvIGY), I know it really got played out, I just think is a great song 




 Fuck no, [Donald Faison doing "Booty Wurk" acapella](https://youtu.be/3TNA1XWo86I) cracked me the fuck up.  




 Something is wrong with us I guess 




 That hair!  Omg I'm in love with your baby  




 Backstreet Boys sexy dancing,  probably.  




 What did it taste like 




 I never had the *want* to dress like them,  but their music was fucking funny.   




 I love tilapia l, I don't see why it wouldn't work in this recipe. 




 My opinion is they are watchable.  They kept coming up with ideas that held my interest.  The end reveal of Jigsaw's last helper shocked me.  




 [Dead Man's Party by Oingo Boingo](https://youtu.be/iypUpv9xelg) 




 The gore gets more intense/ridiculous  as you go through the movies.  I finally just finished them all, I liked them,  actually. I was surprised.  But yea, don't watch if you don't like torture.
