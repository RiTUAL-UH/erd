 I literally love you... 




 They actually both look like the type of movie I'm looking for, just in different ways. 




 I've been avoiding that movie for a while out of fear that it will be a letdown. Purely because of that recommendation, I'm going to watch it right now. 




 I'm looking for a movie to try to help me get through an existential crisis. Anyone have any good recommendations?  




 Something I probably should have mentioned is that I'm 16.
It's not all food that makes me feel sick, it's just a lot of the stuff I don't eat. I'm really not sure why, that's just how I am.

 What do you guys think about it?  




 A bunch of jocks at my school had learned from some kids how to do this. They then decided to use it on progress book and print it out to show their coaches because they had to have a certain GPA. Coaches now require you to show them via mobile device. 




 I guess I could just add it myself. 




 Can I get this in 1920x1080?? 




 Yah that's a good point.
