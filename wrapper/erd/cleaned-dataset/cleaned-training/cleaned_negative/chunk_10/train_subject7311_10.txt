 Well I'm glad to find someone that shares my enthusiasm! I'm really hoping this isn't a flop; it looks fun and isn't associated with a huge franchise like everything else nowadays!  




 I've really enjoyed the trailers but as far as I'm aware there's not a lot of buzz around this film.. 

Am I wrong? Are there people excited for this movie? Or does this film just look "meh" to others?

 Buried 

ET (I've never watched it.. Hence why I bought it on Blu-Ray) 

Road to Perdition 

The Worlds End

I think there are a couple more.. I buy cheap blurays from CEX that I want to watch, but sometimes I end up going back for more and other films just get left out along the way!  




 Land Before Time is one I battled over for my own list 




 I know what you mean, should've made it top 10 at least! 




 Seeing a lot if these going around lately and got curious! 

*Give Reasons?* It's fun to discuss!

**1.** The Lion King
**2.** Beauty and the Beast
**3.** Princess Mononoke
**4.** The Iron Giant
**5.** Toy Story 

The majority of this list is because I've been watching them since I was a small child. But as I've grown up I appreciate the deeper themes, especially in The Lion King and Toy Story. 

Princess Mononoke introduced me to Studio Ghibli at a later age, and I love the art, the action and the mythology!  




 1) Star Wars V: The Empire Strikes Back
2) The Lion King
3) Shawshank Redemption 
4) Pokemon The Movie: 2000
5) Django Unchained  




 Thanks, definitely using this chart! And will check out everything you suggested and your post :) 




 Thanks, looked them all up and they all seem really interesting so I'm adding them to my list :D 




 Thanks, I can tell I'll be on this all day ha!
