 I think it's just how they are spelling deli 



















 They had just finished eating so that's partially true  







































 When I was young, maybe 6-7, I woke up in the middle of the night to my mom looking out the window and mumbling. She kept saying some like How come the sun isn't up? Its going to be in so much trouble when I tell its mother." I was understandably confused and kind of scared and when I asked her what she was doing she kept mumbling about the sun not being up. She then went to bed. I brought it up to her and she swears it never happened. I've always just assumed she was sleep walking but it was super weird. 




 I like good sushi a lot but I know what you mean, I'm never full after eating it and neither is my wallet  




 WaWa coffee is the best for a gas station, way better than Sheetz 




 I've never heard of this place, where are they? 




 They were pretty decent before they became a nationwide chain but now sadly I would have to agree with you. I do still buy their salt and vinegar dry seasoning for use at home, shit is delicious.
