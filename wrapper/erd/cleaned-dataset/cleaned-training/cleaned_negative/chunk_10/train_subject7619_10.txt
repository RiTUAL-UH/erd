 [Quick! Catch it!](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/992/407/776.jpg) 




 I'd like one.

(   ) 









 The good news is that the science is impossible for any reasonable person to deny, and Arnold is just one of a growing sea change in the Republican party; [they *are* coming around.](http://environment.yale.edu/climate-communication/article/not-all-republicans-think-alike-about-global-warming/) 




 I'm with you because you came to the right conclusion, but you got there the wrong way, both anecdotal and mistaking weather for climate. 

Weather is obviously an effect of climate and affected *by* climate, but weather  climate. 

I'm only cautioning this kind of statement because someone like me, a New Englander, can point to our horrendous 2014/2015 winter and say, "See? Climate change isn't real because it was really cold and snowed a lot." 




 Yeah. 20,000 years ago the temperature was some 8 to 10 C colder than it is today. But to draw a line from that point to today and say, "look, 20K years of global warming!" is dubious and arbitrary at best.

If you have look at [this graph of temperature](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Holocene_Temperature_Variations.png), starting at a point when we were finishing the climb out of deep glaciation, you can clearly see that rapid warming ceased around 10,000 years ago (rapid relative to natural fluctuations, but not compared to the warming today, which is an order of magnitude faster). After a final little lift 8,000 years ago, temperature trended downward for the entire period of the Holocene. So the post-industrial revolution warming is the reversal of a many-thousand-year trend.

A closer look at [todays trend](http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/), within the context of the last [1,000](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:1000_Year_Temperature_Comparison.png) and [2,000](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:2000_Year_Temperature_Comparison.png) years, makes it even clearer that todays trend is striking  opposite to what one would expect without anthropogenic interference.

If you really want to play the global warming started X years ago game, you should talk about how were reversing a [5-million-year cooling trend](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Five_Myr_Climate_Change.png)  or go crazy and track global temperatures right back to the origins of the planet! Not that thered be much point

Fifty-five million years ago, a 5-degree Celsius rise in average global temperatures seems to have occurred in just 13 years, according to [a study published in the October 2013 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences](http://phys.org/news/2013-10-climate-geological-instant.html). [A report in the August 2013 issue of Science revealed that in the near term, earth's climate will change 10 times faster than during any other moment in the last 65 million years.](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/08/130801142420.htm)

But I'm sure you know better than the overwhelming consensus of the world's climate scientists. Those guys don't know dick and you seem to have it all figured out. Bravo. 




 The OP concerns what Arnold Schwarzenegger is saying, which is news/relevant because it's coming from a well-known Republican figurehead that is extremely popular on Reddit.

I could have chosen from roughly 50 sources; they all repeat what Arnold Schwarzenegger said verbatim or otherwise give excerpts. The source doesn't matter much when it comes to quoting what Arnold Schwarzenegger has to say.

Quoting Arnold Schwarzenegger isn't a big deal and the source is basically irrelevant. Dismissing climate change or its level of seriousness as "science fiction" warrants a source better than almost all the world's climate scientists' consensus on the matter.

The Cato Institute ain't it. 




 Oh, good. The Cato Institute is your source. That's a good source because they have no political lean in one direction or the other and are therefore completely unbiased. /s 




 [Yeah, but...](http://i.imgur.com/vKgcw.gif) 




  It's just that so many of the Conservative politicians are in the pockets of Oil and Gas interests.

Exactly. We're talking about big oil, subsidized to the tune of $10 billion to $52 billion annually in spite of [record profits.](http://abcnews.go.com/Business/story?id=5503955)

[Here's an article](http://qctimes.com/news/opinion/mailbag/big-oil-profits-from-climate-change-denial/article_35aac953-e4fd-5148-a5a1-72e97539b11a.html) on how much big oil profits from climate change denial. 




 No argument there; I'm just saying I doubt there just happen to be a whole lot of pro-business Republicans/conservatives who deny climate change because they actually don't believe climate scientists whose job it is to know these things. 




 Fair point, but my statement stands. Politicians who deny climate science are doing it because ignoring climate change is good for business.

Industries that profit directly or indirectly from fossil fuel consumption don't want a sudden shift in environmental policy and green energy. 




 Actionsintentions.

The fact that this benefits a lot of people outweighs his motivations for doing it. 




  I read it in Norm McDonald's voice

This is some Twilight Zone shit; I *wrote* that in Norm McDonald's voice!

I was actually picturing him saying this on Weekend Update when I wrote it. 




  half of whom received law degrees and are still stupider than Arnold

I doubt they're stupid. Like you say, most politicians hold high degrees from prestigious schools. They're educated men.

When politicians deny climate science, they're probably not doing it because they're stupid; they're doing it because businesses from whom addressing climate change would undermine their profits are literally paying them to.

The reason pro-business types and environmentalists often clash is because the two are often diametrically opposed. 









 [Hey, I like you too...](http://i.imgur.com/G9g3fMp.gifv) 









 Probably the most interesting and informative thing I'll read all day. Thank you for perfectly answering something I've wondered about for a while now. 




 Well, I'm in the good ol' USA, so that means I can't afford to look into it, and by the time I can, they'll tell me it's prostate cancer and it's progressed too much to treat. If only I'd come in sooner... 




 The guy points as if there's anything else to see but the truck tipping over, and, in doing so, covers the truck tripping over.

That is some top notch filming technique right there.

Props to the truck driver; he handled it that well, all things considered. 




 Welcome to /r/funny, [where the content is reposts and the karma don't matter.](http://i1.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/012/446/whoseline.PNG) 




 I honestly can't. 




 When did I say it was the literal truth? 




 Hopefully you have insurance and it's a simple matter of making a doctor appointment and getting a good ol' finger up the ass. 




 The toothpaste method doesn't get to the urine trapped where the taint is, though. 

I can wait until there's no one else at the wall, or, if all fails, I can do it pretty discretely. It's a quick and easy maneuver and often saves an embarrassing trickle. 




 This is starting to feel like a creepy master/slave arrangement... 




 Spooking without a permit. 




 Me too; you're question prompted me to find the answer I had never bothered looking up before.

I don't have insurance and won't for a while, so I hope it's not serious. 




 If your pants are on, as in you're using the fly of your pants and the door on your boxers, it's easy to reach back and under and give the necessary push pressure. It sometimes results in a good squirt, and you really get a sense of what runs down your leg when you zip up and walk away without taking the necessary precautions.  




 Tall and narrow. Imagine having to drive that thing with intense crosswinds on a highway? 




 [50 Shades of Gay](https://www.ted.com/talks/io_tillett_wright_fifty_shades_of_gay?language=en) 




 Many men experience a less powerful urinary stream when emptying the bladder, as they get older.

It is estimated that something like 1 in 3 men over the age of 50 develop urinary outflow symptoms, which in the majority of cases is due to benign enlargement of the prostate gland, otherwise known as benign prostatic hyperplasia.

The gland gradually enlarges as the years go by, and this enlargement can cause pressure on the water pipe which runs from the bladder to the outside (the urethra), restricting the flow of urine in just the same way that water running through a hose is restricted if the hose is kinked or compressed.

Another cause of urinary flow restriction is a stricture in the urethra as a result of inflammatory scarring, perhaps as a result of a previous infection or operative catheterization.

My advice would be to go along and see your GP so that an examination of your prostate gland may take place.

Initially, examination with a gloved finger can determine whether the gland is physically enlarged, and a blood test known as a PSA (prostate specific antigen) can measure a chemical secreted by the prostate gland to ensure that any enlargement is benign.

If necessary, a rectal ultrasound test can be organized to further examine the interior of the gland non-invasively.

I strongly advise you not to delay seeking help, as there is much evidence that early treatment with medication can prevent the problem from becoming worse, and often delays the need for surgery in years to come.

At any rate, if you have noticed symptoms your prostate gland should be examined because prostate cancer, although an unlikely possibility in your case, is very much on the increase and is potentially very serious even in relatively young men like yourself.

 This is true *and* one of my favorite movies, but as someone tired of the same old shit, I will continue to use Karma Decay and fight the good fight.

Good day sir! 




 I've known about them since I was 17, but I've also known about lots of things that would have benefited me in the long run. Doing those things is a different story. 




 I've been there. Truth-be-told, reposts do more good than harm. You're not the only one who hasn't seen it, you're not the only to be amused by it, and people like me who have seen it reposted again and again can't be *too* bothered by it, right? 




 This has never been funny.

 Even /u/Darksoulz4dayz concedes: Martian Manhunter was able to 'beat' him by creating an illusion in his mind where he was human and had a family. I think if he actually tried to fight back he could break through MMH's telepathy, but he was content with what the Martian made for him.

I think we've successfully proven that MMH, not Superman, and the most OP superhero in the DCU.

 I also don't understand how terms like "horizontal" can be applied to outer space. How can "Uranus spin on its side." Relative to what?  




 Jesus also once cursed a fig tree for not bearing fruit.

Jesus does not put up with slacker fig trees.

^12 The next day as they were leaving Bethany, Jesus was hungry. ^13 Seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to find out if it had any fruit. When he reached it, he found nothing but leaves, because it was not the season for figs. ^14 Then he said to the tree, May no one ever eat fruit from you again. And his disciples heard him say it.

. . . 

^20 In the morning, as they went along, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots. ^21 Peter remembered and said to Jesus, Rabbi, look! The fig tree you cursed has withered!

 /r/Showerthoughts loves Scooby Doo.

* The Scooby-Doo gang must spend a lot of time in court testifying against "bad guys."

* Scooby Doo's "accent" makes absolutely no sense. He's capable of making every sound a fluent English speaker can make, just as long as it's not at the beginning of the word.

* After the police arrest the villains in Scooby Doo, what do they charge them with?

* The bad guys on Scooby Doo could probably have made more money selling Halloween costumes than trying to pull off their scams.

* How come in Scooby Doo's Universe monsters and ghost are dismissed as hoaxes yet nobody bats an eye at the talking dog

* What if Scooby Doo and the gang are the real ghosts and can't rest until they solve the mystery of their own murder?

* Scooby Doo is CSI for kids.

* Some company in "Scooby-Doo" had to manufacture snacks specifically for Scooby's consumption.

* Scrappy-Doo is to Scooby-Doo what Jar Jar Binks is to Star Wars

* What the fuck kind of name for a dog is "Scooby Doo"? 

* In "Scooby Doo" the gang isn't really solving mysteries about ghosts, ghouls, etc. They're actually just doing drugs with Shaggy in the Mystery Van and hallucinating their adventures. 

* Ashton Kutcher would have been a great choice for Shaggy in the live-action Scooby Doo movie.

* The villains in Scooby-Doo never murdered or stole, they were just really spooky 

* Scooby Doo's mystery team would have made their lives a lot easier if they decided to crackdown on the kingpin making all those high quality masks for criminals 

* Maybe the reason law and order, CSI, and other drama mysteries are so popular is because all the people who grew up watching Scooby-Doo... 

* If someone goes back in time to show the creator of Scooby Doo what they make, and they make Scooby Doo because that person showed them Scooby Doo, where did Scooby Doo start?

* Is Scooby Doo named after Scooby Snacks or did a company name themselves after him? (self.Showerthoughts)

* Blues Clues was like the early years/ origin story for Scooby Doo. 

* Scrappy-doo has Scooby's surname, so his sister most have had him out of wedlock. 

* Where did the villains in Scooby Doo get all those unique masks? 

* Courage the Cowardly Dog + That 70s Show = Scooby Doo

* Velma from Scooby Doo should really look into getting contacts

* Criminals in the Scooby-Doo universe go to jail for wearing costumes and scaring people.....harsh.

* If Scooby-Doo eats Scooby-Snacks, he'll still ultimately make Scooby-Doo. 

* "Scooby Doobie Doo" is a strong hint at Scooby and Shaggy's frequent marijuana use 

* If there were an episode of Scooby Doo where the "main suspect" actually ended up being the monster, it would be the biggest plot twist ever. 

* In Scooby Doo, the paranormal crime always turns out to be a dude in suit. In the X-files, the 'normal' crime always turns out to be freaky shit.

* In Scooby Doo, no-one reads the criminals their Miranda Rights. 

* Many of the villains from Scooby-Doo would be extremely rich if they patented the technology in their costumes.

* The story of the Disney movie Bighero is just a generic plot of Scooby doo. 

* Considering every supernatural element the Scooby-Doo team uncover is in fact mundane, that talking dog they have with them must just be an old guy in a costume 

* Scooby-Doo and the gang were most likely high on acid for every episode until the end.

* Why didn't they name Scooby Doo a word he could pronounce?

* A cabin in the woods is scooby doo but scooby is a black dude

* Scooby Doo is about hipsters unmasking crooks using supernatural or monster costumes that terrify the gang... With the help of a conscious talking dog.

* Scooby Doo teaches kids that everything supernatural or otherworldly Is just some asshole trying to scare you so they can make some money

* Scooby-Doo was a show about functional meddling kids that kept actual kids from meddling

* Scooby Doo's catch phrase was Hanna-Barbera's own nod to their longest running primetime cartoon, The Flintstones.

* Scooby's name in Scooby Doo is derived from the word dooby. 

* There should be a YouTube artist who's "thing" is finishing fake songs that appear in other media. (i.e. The Spice Girls from Scooby-Doo, Genovia's national anthem) 

* Technically, Scooby Doo was the first Snoop Dogg. 

* If it wasn't for society/media, would cemeteries be scary?

* Every episode from 'Scooby Doo' ends with a plot twist

* Gilligan, from Gilligan's Island, makes me think of Scooby-Doo as a human. 

* House is like the adult version of Scooby Doo as far as mystery solving tv shows go 

* Scooby-Doo is the only one in the 1969 series with eyes that aren't 100% pupil. 

* Scooby-Doo teaches us that humans are scarier than any monster we could make up 

* Scooby Doo, Shaggy and the rest of the gang must have to testify in court a lot. 

* Why doesn't Velma from Scooby Doo just get contacts? 

* Shaggy from Scooby-doo sounds like fucky in the UK

* Scooby Doo has lived a lot longer more than most dogs.

* Scooby Doo would make a great lead singer for a Deathcore band.

* Velma from Scooby-Doo is in the perfect position to commit the crime. 

* What if the Scooby Doo show takes place in a psychiatric asylum where they have an imaginary talking dog that helps solve puzzles they can't solve on their own?

* 90% of Scooby Doo villains were less harmful to their "victims" than the average prank video on YouTube

* The X-Files was one, long Scooby Doo episode.

* Like the most recent Scooby-Doo movie, the Teenage Mutant Turtles Movie is the retro film I'm supposed to want to see, but whose series I never actually liked 

* In the Scooby Doo movie "Zombie Island", Shaggy and Scooby get caught eating all the contraband cheese while at work. The cheese contraband was just substitute for Shaggy and Scooby smoking contraband at work.


* If every dog in the world turned into Scooby Doo. We'd never face fear again. Except by talking dogs.

* Every episode of Scooby Doo is like a cartoon version of the reality TV show, Catfish.

 I wish the 539 people who have commented ITT would read at least this much about the Infinite Monkey Theorem; it would end most of the arguments:

The infinite monkey theorem states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type a given text, such as the complete works of William Shakespeare.

In this context, ***"almost surely" is a mathematical term with a precise meaning***, and ***the "monkey" is not an actual monkey, but a metaphor for an abstract device that produces an endless random sequence of letters and symbols.*** 

The relevance of the theorem is questionablethe probability of a universe full of monkeys typing a complete work such as Shakespeare's Hamlet is so tiny that the chance of it occurring during a period of time hundreds of thousands of orders of magnitude longer than the age of the universe is extremely low (but technically not zero). 

***It should also be noted that real monkeys don't produce uniformly random output***, which means that ***an actual monkey hitting keys for an infinite amount of time has no statistical certainty of ever producing any given text.***

[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem) (emphasis mine) 




  The theorem clearly calls for monkeys.

No it doesn't.

The infinite monkey theorem states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type a given text, such as the complete works of William Shakespeare.

In this context, "almost surely" is a mathematical term with a precise meaning, and ***the "monkey" is not an actual monkey, but a metaphor for an abstract device that produces an endless random sequence of letters and symbols.***

 Elsewhere in this topic, /u/Darksoulz4dayz has made a compelling argument for Captain Atom.

How does MMH versus Captain Atom play out? 




  New 52 Captain Atom was shown to be able to sever Flash's connection from the Speedforce.

If that's true, he can transmute matter to create all the Kryptonite he needs to kill Superman and The Flash would be nothing without the Speedforce. Who else is left that could challenge him? 




 Considering The Empty hand can seemingly just will things to its desire and has already conquered multiple multiverses, yeah... 




 January 2, 2015: the Obama administration announced a new $536 million contract for the next five years of improvement and maintenance of Healthcare.gov, the ObamaCare website.

So that would be approximately $107.2 million per year for the next five years.

To compare, Reddit costs just over $33.5k per month in server expenses, so that's $402,000 per year, which is less than HealthCare.Gov, but they are very different animals.

 Of all the things you could have left me with, I'm grateful it was that. 




 [You're killing me...](http://i.imgur.com/bzhyjpr.gif) 




 Yeah, but you could say that about lots of things... 




  I think the number of people who would rather have $16,400 is probably a pretty significant number.

All good points, and you're probably right. Of course, having insurance could very easily save some people $16,400 or more in any given year. Anyone is one health or injury catastrophe from massive hospital bills. Something like this is incredibly difficult to measure in terms of real value. 




 If it came down to Darkseid and Anti-Monitor, you'd have DC's current storyline: The Darkseid War.

I had no idea Larfleeze was so OP. I assume it's because he's the sole bearer of the Orange Lantern? 




 So... Zoloman is the last man standing?

Damn. 




 Nix Uotan? Final Crisis made him a human vessel through with the Overmonitor can see the unified reality, which has since split again so he's really unknown as far as the New 52 is concerned. Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't believe he's been mentioned since Final Crisis. If he were, he'd win; you're absolutely right. He has all the answers to guys like Superman and The Flash.

As for Captain Atom, I'm not convinced he could take Superman or The Flash. Although Captain Atom can create insane amounts of power and even transmute matter, he also absorbs energy, which means Superman or The Flash could overwhelm him until he's unstable, reaches critical, and he self-destructs. 

If he can transmute the entire battle arena or at least a lot of it into Kryptonite, that would be one way he could gain an advantage over Superman, but I don't know what he could do against The Flash. I'd see The Flash whipping up some Speed Force nonsense, Captain Atom overloads and explodes, The Flash contains it, and we have a winner.

I'd also question Captain Atom's abilities against Shazam. He doesn't really have any defense against magic.  




 If that's the case, can't he take Superman? He canonically took on the entire Justice League by himself and didn't lose. No matter how hard Superman can hit, MMH can density shift through it. Oh, and [he hits pretty fucking hard himself.](http://i.imgur.com/W4ZmfTp.jpg)

If MMH can overcome the fire issue, and he provably has, can anyone conceivably stop him? 




 Great question. 

That's the total cost for the entire project, which includes setting up the physical and technical infrastructure for the entire exchange, as well as every state's exchange (those that chose to implement them, anyway). It also includes staffing for all the people who did that work, as well as all the lawyers/business people/bureaucrats who made the whole project work.

It wasn't so much a $634m website; it was a $634m system.

/u/EngineeredMadness talks about a lot of the bureaucratic and technical backend reasons that make this project expensive by it's very nature: http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1owop4/eli5_how_did_healthcaregov_cost_634000000_that/ccwhsmv

/u/avacar points out that the $634m price tag is a grand total over several contracts that were signed to the company that did the work. There was a whole lot of prep work that took years to go through in order to even be able to begin building a system this complex, and it took a lot of people a lot of time to do it. Couple this with EngineeredMadness's points and you've got a pretty good idea of what happened.

http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1owop4/eli5_how_did_healthcaregov_cost_634000000_that/ccwgh1k

Again, I'm not defending the site, or the cost. It's a government contract, it almost undoubtedly had more bloat to it than it needed to. But if you really look at all the in's and out's of what it would take to build a system this complex, you can at least comprehend the reasoning behind why the numbers got so large, and can hopefully appreciate why keeping the site both functional, responsive, and stable is a momentous undertaking.

 I suppose that's better than Deadcat... 




 I don't completely disagree with you. It's funny; I actually liked it more as a kid and don't like it nearly as much now that I'm in my 30s. It's better than Frontier, Insurrection, and Nemesis, but I don't prefer it.

First Contact is actually my favorite Star Trek movie, and for most purists, anything but Khan is heresy. Whatever, though. I'm more of a Next Generation fan so that's really the best of them for us. 




 Questioning the validity of The Daily Mail is perfectly reasonable. 

Office of Inspector General released a report finding that the total cost of the HealthCare.gov website had reached $1.7 billion.

 It's worded strangely too.

Actual costs of overhead are much, much higher, as in $[279 ***billion***. ](http://www.cnbc.com/2015/05/27/obamacares-big-overhead-costs-to-top-270b.html)

[There are approximately 321.3 million American citizens](http://www.census.gov/popclock/), so you could instead give $644.25 to each citizen.

I think most people would probably rather have the insurance than the $644.25, but that's purely speculation on part. I can't prove that.

**EDIT**: Looks like the actual costs of the website were significantly higher: Office of Inspector General released a report finding that the total cost of the HealthCare.gov website had reached $1.7 billion.

 It's not just the worst Star Trek movies; it's one of the worst movies. Period. 




 That is a great explanation, and it also leads to believe Zoom wins this entire showdown because that logic can be applied to everyone.

Could it come down to Eobard Thawne VS Hunter Zolomon? 




 Zoom kills Darkseid?

I'm not saying your wrong, but wow. How does that play out? 




 The obvious guess is Darkseid. Does anyone have a better answer?

Rules:

1. This is sudden. Every superhero on earth is teleported into this inescapable arena all at once without warning. It's large enough to have an area of every earth climate/terrain including cityscape, desert, ocean, waterfall, plains, etc.

2. Anyone who generally carries (insert weapon, object, whatever) has it with them. Yes, weapons are allowed.

3. This is a "Hunger Games" style battle to the death, last man standing. That means "no kill rule" characters will kill and must kill to survive. This isn't about the characters' ethics; it's about their abilities. 




 Totally, and I don't think it was bad enough to warrant tanking the franchise. A good sequel could have saved it, and the sequel they were obviously setting up would have meant a lot more Sinestro, which was the best part of the first one.

I really think they should consider allowing it to be canon, make a sequel, and even if they can't get Ryan or they think he'd be too strongly associated with the competitor's Deadpool, they could introduce John Stewart, Kyle, or even Guy and have all this compatible with Man of Steel, Batman v Superman, Suicide Squad, Justice League, etc. 




 Who would be the biggest threat to him? [Fire?](http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Fire)

 "The Homer" (also known as "The Car Built for Homer") was a car designed by Homer Simpson when his half-brother, Herb, gave Homer a job at Powell Motors. It is a parody/exaggeration of the Edsel, a similarly disastrous automobile designed by Ford Motor Company.

http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/The_Homer

The storyline of a controversially styled car causing the company to fail both echoes that of the Edsel and the Tucker Torpedo. The Edsel was a controversially styled car that bore the name of Henry Ford's son, Edsel Ford, and is now considered one of the biggest car flops in history. Production of the Tucker Torpedo, which introduced many new features, was shut down amidst scandal and accusations of stock fraud in 1949.[3] Homer wants the horns of the car he is designing to play the traditional Spanish folk corrido "La Cucaracha".[5] The Pope shows up for the unveiling of Homer's new car.[5] Herb berates his staff for suggesting that the company name a new car "Persephone" after the Greek goddess of fertility in Greek mythology. Herb tells the staff, "People don't want cars named after hungry old Greek broads! They want names like 'Mustang' and 'Cheetah'vicious animal names," referencing the Ford Mustang and Lamborghini Cheetah cars.[6]

 I don't think it's terrible; it just wasn't that good. The parts that were good were really good, but the overall product seemed undercooked, too long, and anticlimactic. To me, the whole problem with it was how overwhelmingly average it was. 




 Correcting their English would be helpful either way, and the question  of OP's native land and/or tongue is exactly why I phrased "Is OP proving the point" as a question.

 It's unfairly maligned. Khan was supposed to end the series, so it made some moves that couldn't be sensibly undone. It turned out to be so damned good, it revitalized interest in the franchise. Of course they needed Spock, he played hard ball and said he'd only come back if he could direct, and they did what they thought they had to.

The trailers also gave away one of the biggest surprises: the death of the USS Enterprise. 

Anyway, it gave us [this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k9Ukm9LaWg)

All else is forgiven.  




 Not according to Homer:

Bart: No offense Homer, but your half-assed under-parenting was a whole lot better than your half-assed over-parenting

Homer: Aw, but i was using my *whole* ass... 




  ST:Wrath of Khan is the best 'Star Trek' movie, ST:The Motion Picture is the better movie.

I can hear myself repeating this line in the future. You absolutely nailed something I've always kind of thought, but didn't quite know how to express.

ST:TMP is hugely underrated in my opinion.

 I don't hate it. It's definitely better than The Final Frontier. 




 I'd personally rate Khan over Darkness, but there's no accounting for taste... 




 Considering his were two of the best movies in the franchise's history, you're absolutely right. 




 I was never too big on Search, but it's leaps and bounds better than Final Frontier. 




 Judging from most internet comments, the answer is almost always lens flare. 




 Yeah, was looking for an odd movie to be good, but I guess Nemesis truly kicked it off by an even number being god awful. 




 Apparently Simon Pegg has concerns about writing an odd-numbered Star Trek movie, but the curse seems to have been broken by 11   12 both being good with 11 actually getting generally better reviews than 12.

 He looked pretty much perfect, but his voice and the way he carried himself were all wrong. I always imagined him with a deep, booming, maybe even slightly synthetic/metallic voice, carrying himself with all the pomp and dignity of an absolute ruler/tyrant.

Instead he just sounded like some random asshole. 




 Words have meaning! 




 I didn't even think of that, but yeah, good call. 




 /u/rMunky pretty much answered, but all the reader sees is Batman asking The Joker's true identity and responding, "No. That's not possible."

 K.

[Here's John McCain on biography.com](http://www.biography.com/people/john-mccain-9542249#introduction-to-politics)

It's actually more impressive than his own website. 




 The Joker was already iconic before the animated series with Hamill though

No shit, that's why I said: "Hamill's voice and laugh as The Joker is an iconic voice and laugh associated with an iconic villain." I didn't say his voice and laugh made the character iconic. 


And the nonstop circlejerk for Hamill's Joker ought to prove that Hamill absolutely deserves credit for his takes on the character which are clearly preferred and beloved by either a majority of the fans or an insanely vocal minority. 

I personally have never once picked up a comic book and heard Jack Nicholson or Ledger's voice or laugh in my head. Hamill's? That's all I'll ever hear because you just can't top perfection. 




 I get what you mean, but if the character *isn't* at least a psychotic anarchist dressed like a clown--the mob relations aren't vital to the character--he can scarcely be called The Joker. 




  Yeaaa, it is.

You're right; your insanely clever comment and all its wit and irony went right over my head. I'm truly a dullard. 




 Spoiler alert (I can never get the spoiler tags to work; I have not ruled out the possibility that I'm an idiot).

Storyline: Darkseid War is going on and whenever Darkseid is at war, the New Gods are involved. This includes Metron who was dethroned from The Mobius Chair, which Batman takes the liberty of sitting on, which only a god can/should do, and it gives him godlike omniscience; the chair can answer any question. Basically, Batman can know anything that is knowable, so he asks it who killed his parents, the true identity of The Joker, and the answer to why it is that 42 is the answer to everything.

In reality? Only Geoff Johns could answer that, but it wouldn't be the first time they took real-world criticisms and turned them on their heads for the purpose of storytelling. The "Batgod" label has been pervasive in DC Comics for some time, often making Batman seem bizarrely OP for a guy with no superpowers. I would imagine a pitch meeting where someone said, "What if he were actually made a god? What would he do?" and the responses to that question were interesting enough to warrant exploring.

That and having him straight up murder Darkseid has already been done, so they were probably trying to figure out a new way to wrap this thing up. 




 Maybe because no other actor has so perfectly captured the voice and laugh to the point where most comics readers "hear" Hamill in their heads whilst reading the character's thoughts, lines, and laughs. 




 Hamill's voice and laugh as The Joker is an iconic voice and laugh associated with an iconic villain. He is absolutely fundamental to how his takes on The Joker have been perceived.  




 Considering how many have taken on the role, that's a high compliment. 




 Super Friends represent! 




 Might as well include [Anthony Misiano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxribF26Ldo) if we're including internet-famous Jokers. 




 All they can possibly base this on is his line in the trailer, "I'm not gonna kill you; I'm just gonna hurtcha really, really bad," which definitely came off as "psychotic," but to be fair, almost every iteration of the character could be justifiably called "psychotic." 




 He replaced Mark Hamill and tried his best to do Hamill's voice and laugh. 




 Yeah, they were doing a tribute to the [Dick Sprang] version while trying to find a Joker that hadn't been done and reflected the tongue-in-cheek style of the show.

Like you wrote, I understood, but I didn't enjoy it. 




 Worst part of an otherwise great series. 




 Young Justice. 




  Leto aside

He could be all those things; we really don't know much about the character. 




 You such at math. If /u/aroad is turning 20 next week, he was born in 1995.

Jack's Joker was in 89 and Cesar's was in 66. His age can't have much to do with it now can it? 




 I want to fix this meme.

I'll do it right.

White text outlined in black.

Mark Hamill, although a personal favorite of mine, won't be declared "the one true" because there isn't any.

Help me, /r/batman; you're my only hope.

I can't be patrolling /r/batman all day to see what has and hasn't been posted already. You've already seen it? Good for you! Downvote it and move on. 




 The answer to your question depends on the context of the word "why." Are you asking why Batman became a new god in terms of the storyline, or the real-life rationale behind Geoff Johns' decision to do this? 




 This is from Justice League 42, which is a part of the Darkseid War storyline.

Bernie Sanders says what he thinks and it's not a bunch of venomous bile and bullshit. He actually stands for things and they're good things.

 This has to be the most overused and wrongly-used comments on Reddit.

It is not a logical fallacy of any kind to point out that not all Republicans are idiots. Even if all idiots were Republicans, it would still be perfectly acceptable to say that not all Republicans are idiots so long as it were true, which it obviously is.

I should also point out that it's possible to disagree with people without writing them off as stupid. 









 There are not 600 levels, so I'm not sure why it has that designation, but it's where the metahumans are imprisoned. 

I'm 34 and I've been reading/following DC Comics since I was about 5, and "level 600" means nothing to me. 




 I see it as more of a critique on consumerism and how it enables the capitalist than a critique of capitalism itself, but yes, you're right. 




 Terry's Batman isn't Elseworlds; it's considered canon. 

As for precedent, In Jeph Loeb's Superman/Batman #22 (preNew52 version written by Jeph Loeb), a Batman wearing the Beyond costume appeared, which was the Beyond version of Batman's first foray into the regular DC Comics continuity. Bizarro was transported to an alternate version of Gotham City. In issue #23, this Batman is named "Tim". 

Fun fact: the packaging for the action figure created by DC Direct based on this appearance in Superman/Batman identifies Batman Beyond as Tim Drake.

As for mainstream continuity, in Batman #700, Terry McGinnis was included in the one-off as a part of the DC Universe presented, had a history with Damian Wayne, who rescued him as Batman from Two-Face-Two when he was held hostage as an infant. Terry was directly inspired by Batman, but it was the Damian Wayne Batman. 

The plot involved Two-Face-Two (if ever a villain warranted a sequel) believed Terry McGinnis was one of a pair of twin boys who were the sons of billionaires rather than Warren and Mary McGinnis. Two-Face-Two transformed Terry into a miniature duplicate of the Joker with the Joker's toxin. Damian administered the antidote after he rescued Terry. In the following page, a teenage McGinnis is seen behind the Batman cowl, battling the apparently-resurrected Joker, with Damian as his mentor, instead of Bruce.

Superman/Batman Annual #4 featured Terry McGinnis' Batman in mainstream continuity as well. It picked up after Superman's first meeting with the new Terry Batman, and Terry Batman also took part heavily in Future's End. 

He is 100% a part of regular DC continuity.

Or *was.*

But it's comics, so he'll totally come back because clones or time travel or alternative dimensions or whatever. 




 [SPOILERS]

Terry was killed during Future's End and Tim Drake finally took up the mantle of Batman. The book is relaunching with a new series starting at #1 with Tim Drake as Batman.

 




 I'm torn between that and [Robin getting down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95VTu4Dfag8) in the driver ed vehicle.

 




 [This free "sneak peak"](http://www.dccomics.com/comics/we-are-robin-2015/dc-sneak-peek-we-are-robin-2015) should tell you everything you need to know. 




 I agree with you completely; they represent interpretations of the character, not necessarily specific wearers of the duds. 




 The default, regular Robin on the show is Dick, the female is CK, but the other two are very debatable. 

Dick   Jason are the only two to ever wear the fish scale armor short shorts, and since regular Robin is Dick, that would leave short shorts to be Jason, but the personality is more in line with silver age Robin, AKA Dick. 

Meanwhile, the black-caped Robin is wearing Tim Drake's threads and has the darker attitude, but that attitude could be associated with Tim or Jason.

So... my take is that it's representations of different takes on Robin without being any identity in particular. Robin has been the wide-eyed Boy Wonder of the silver age, the Dark Knight Returns Girl Wonder, and the darker, more brooding sidekick. 




 As much as Liam Neeson did a fine job, I'd prefer an Arabian character with a name like   to actually be middle-eastern. I don't always care about an actor being the same ethnicity as the character they're playing, but in this case, and Bane's, their ethnicity was relevant to the character.

Still, I thought Begins was overall a strong entry and set the stage quite nicely for The Dark Knight. I do feel like The Dark Knight was a bit rushed or overstuffed though. There was enough there to make The Joker the one-and-only and have Dent's transformation a background story, revealing the Two-Face part in the following movie. They basically introduced one of Batman's greatest and most interesting villains just to kill him ten minutes later. 




 This is the same subject/object thing as who/whom.

"I" is the subject; "me" is the object.

*I* have to go to the store. 

*Who* is going to the store? *I* am. 

Do you want to come with me? 

Yes.

Good. You and I will go to the store. 

*I* is the subject because *I* is the one doing something.

Do you want to come with me?

*Me* is the object because *me* isn't the subject; *I* is. *I* is the one doing something. *Me* is the object associated with the predicate *with*. Come with whom? Come with me. 




 I hated just about everything to do with Dark Knight Rises. I saw it at a midnight premiere and haven't seen it since, nor do I desire to. It's a shame, because I quite liked Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, but that ended the trilogy on a seriously sour note. 




 There is no "best." The character has been the subject of so many different takes, and there have been very few I didn't like. One such example was the Young Justice version, which is one of the few things that show got heinously wrong.

Dennis O'Neil's take on the character in the 70s is what a lot of people would consider the "classic" Joker and the one that has inspired most interpretations. He did a really great job fleshing out the character and even scored him his own book, which was unheard of for villains. 

Steve Englehart introduced the classic "Laughing Fish" that was used in Batman: The Animated Series. Marshall Rogers introduced the trench coat and fedora which impacted Jack Nicholson's Joker. 

Speaking of which, if you need a legendary actor to play a crazy man, who better than Jack? Tim Burton brought the "goth" to Gotham giving us a demented, insane, criminal mastermind with a twisted sense of humor. While Burton's Batman missed a lot of important points regarding the Batman of comic books, Nicholson's Joker, at the time, was incredibly close to the comics, including the acid bath origin, the disfigured face, not wearing makeup, etc.

Cesar Romano's 1966 TV series Joker was a product of a campy show, more like the zanny nuisance trickster, but that's where get the mainstays like joy buzzers and acid-spitting flowers from.

Mark Hamill's Joker, whether DCAU or the Arkham series of games, gave most us of us the voice we hear in our heads whenever we read the character's lines. The voice and ironic laugh are just unbeatable, and the cartoon very cleverly kept a psychotic clown character in a show geared for children by hinting at the horror without often painting the picture. He was a nice balance of silly and psycho.

Frank Miller's Joker in Dark Knight Returns or Alan Moore's in The Killing Joke each defined the character in their own way. They're two of the darker interpretations, but they're undeniable classics. DKR undoubtedly influenced A Death in The Family, one of the most infamous stories in comics with lasting repercussions. 

Grant Morrison's Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth was groundbreaking and a terrifying look at the character.

The New 52 face-as-a-mask version of Death of the Family was over-the-top, but perhaps the most horrifying. 

As for Heath Ledger, his Joker was intelligent, meaningful, and, in spite of all his cunning calculation and strategic planning, an ironic agent of chaos. It's one of the most memorable and iconic performances in film. 

The Joker is quite possibly the best villain in all of fiction and certainly the best in comics. With so many different takes on the character, I don't see a "best." I see different ways of looking at the same thing, and that thing is the scary nature of the universe and especially death being sadly chaotic and what it means to confront that. 




 Everything since the Bill Finger/Bob Kane original Batman of 1939 is an interpretation of the original and they've all been somewhat-to-radically different ever since, comics included. 

Based on the title of your post, I assume you're mainly concerning yourself with The Joker, and unless you're talking about Jerry Robinson, Bill Finger, and Bob Kane's Joker of the 1940s, you are again talking about a character that has had dozens of different interpretations. 




 Ales is spelled with lowercase letters as opposed to ALS which is all caps, which distinguishes it. Any confusion disappears once they see the "Benefiting ALS.net," again continuing the use of lowercase letters where an initialism isn't being used.

The only other thing they could have done is "A.L.S.," but that is old fashioned and unnecessary.

  Technically 'pink' is just light red

It's got a bit more range than that in terms of what most people would call "pink." In optics, pink can refer to any of the colors between bluish red (purple/violet) and red, of medium to high brightness and of low to moderate saturation.

Although pink is *generally* considered a tint of red--so you're not wrong--most variations of pink lie between red, white and magenta colors. This means that the pink's hue is usually between red and magenta, not just red.

 Also fun, when singing the vocals for the song "Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da," McCartney made a slip and said "Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face", rather than Molly, and had Molly letting "the children lend a hand." George Harrison and Lennon yell "arm" and "leg" during a break in the song; between the lines "...Desmond lets the children lend a hand" and "Molly stays at home..."

Also, Maxwell's Silver Hammer includes Paul laughing over a lyric because John mooned him in the studio after some bad blood between the two over the song.

 I had no idea. I've never played the video games, but my daughter and I build Lego Batman sets all the time and when we discovered there was a movie, we were pleasantly surprised. I really liked it. That's why I found it weird everyone is talking about a Lego Batman movie like it's a new thing; we have two of them on DVD.

 Good or bad is not measured solely by the experience of the victims or whether or not the victims feel victimized, especially when they're robbed of the ability to know one way or the other.

Surely I don't need to explain how it's unethical to intentionally handicap a person or dictate their lot in life. 




 [This Slate article appears to back OP.](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_eye/2013/11/07/revolving_doors_why_don_t_we_use_them_more.html)

The story goes like this: Theophilus Van Kannel hated chivalry. There was nothing he despised more than trying to walk in or out of a building, and locking horns with other men in a game of oh you first, I insist. But most of all, Theophilus Van Kannel hated opening doors for women.

He set about inventing his way out of social phobia. And thats how, in 1888, Theophilus Van Kannel was awarded US Patent #387571 A for a storm-door structure, which would soon become known as the revolving door.

 No, the gentleman's deleted comment said that being a parent of a child with autism isn't any more effort than a child without, which is an asinine comment. 

However, speaking strictly to your question, as horrible as this sounds, I did work with some kids who would have been better off dead, and please don't judge me too harshly until you've had the same experiences. The quality of life for some incredibly low-functioning autistic kids, as well as the severely mentally or physically disabled would be like a lifelong nightmare for some. 

If you were confined to a wheelchair, had little motor control, needed someone to spoon feed you food that has been put through a blender with thickening agent, you had to be fed tiny amounts over a long period of time to limit the likelihood of choking, and you were constantly shitting yourself and incapable of communication, would *you* want to live?
