 But hey, at least I learned that I had mod mail.  




 How do you survive with no income?  




 Limbaugh.  




 Do it, fat boy.  




 a years rent maybe? 




 Currently sunny? Like all the episodes?  




 Current sunny? Like, all the episodes?  




 Walking your dog is weird. Man, I must be twisted.  




 Well, in Manhattan you do.  




 so it is pretty much just broadcast tv?  




 why do you use Hulu. I've benn thinking of grabbing it but I'm not sure why... 




 Yah, I don't even have any shows I used to watch on network tv. Don't even miss it. Thats why I'm wondering why I should even bother with Hulu. 




 But would you pay $4.99 for it. If so, I have the deal for you... 




 I realized that channel surfing was such a wast of time. I never found anything...or actually less than I do now that I just use Netflix/Amazon Prime. 




 I haven't even messed with hulu yet. I just use Netflix and Amazon Prime (barely).

When it comes to local news etc I just stream it from there site live to me tv. 

Does Hulu have enough content that I should snag it up? I have no shows that I care about that are NBC/ABC/CBS etc. 




 just checked out your app. Sounds great but sadly I can't get a signal where I live. I've been just using the local NBC website to stream to my tv when and if I want to watch the news...but thats great what you are doing.  




 Right there with ya. Cheers. Going on two months as well. They would have to pay me to subscribe as well.  




 he must love butt sex. 




 Few towns over.  




 you forgot and also play to an arena full of people frozen in time.  




 Hey, when he threw the inhaler to mikey that shit was pretty noyce. 




 Hard Harry!!! 




 When the dog on the right looks like he has to remind himself not to eat with with his face in the dish and use the fork. 




 there has to be a twist. 




 there's got to be a twist. 




 It's decided we're going to feed D to the walkers.  




 Now I've got thunderpeel stuck in my head.  




 Just finished a mink omelette for breakfast, smarty pants.  




 why 2 years? Why not now or next year? 5 years? 6 months. What is his reasoning for 2 years? Does he want people to be in poverty for 2 more years? Do you have an explanation? 




 when the hell did I say I wanted to keep others down? Quite a stretch. 

Why does this threaten me? It really doesn't. I never said it did. I just brought up a point.  




 I went out with a Carly. She really was a cold bitch.  




 so, what about the people already making 15 an hour somewhere. You expect them to be cool with all of a sudden making minimum wage along with the burger flipper? 




 well, no shit. eventually it will get there.  




 and the people already making 15 bucks an hour? 




 It's a male plane. 




 That top comment though lol 




 i just died. 




 lets hear it for my maaayaaayayn! 




 whats the episode Dennis gets all mesmerized by Charlies techno dance? 




 Cool, thnx.  




 To you it's absurd...but you're not the only person on earth.  




 Your mom...  




 Bhg 




 Cheers. Starting tomorrow once it's not 95 degrees out.  




 Read that in Charlie Kellys voice.  




 Probably big Mac shrapnel.  














 they certified it not cringeworthy 














 Ya, why?  




 Peaches. Oh yeah. Where's the petition TO get her on there?  









 it's not ruined. I meant great whatever as in okay, she acted zany which doesnt take away from the absurdity in this video. You know when somebody tries too hard and its absurd? Why are people not getting that? Are you her son? 




 Bro, I want the old Benjamins back.  




 God dammit Deandra. You keep escalating these situations it needs to stop.  




 I mean...kinda I guess.  




 Yes, as in okay why should I know this? 




  great, whatever.  




 Watch the rest of her stuff it's just kinda how she is.  




 Was really going for him to visit the Jimi Hendrix one in Seattle.  




 Lol 




 Just started this last week. It's great.  




 Everyone needs to see Six feet Under. Best series in my opinion.  




 Oh, honeydew I bet you do.  




 Wow, that was really fucking hilarious. His manureisms really reminded me of a buddy. I have to send this to him. 




 It's not.  




 sounds very familiar.  




 oh my god that poor man. I felt so bad for him I just wanted to give him a pat on the back and tell him...it's probably not ever going to get any better so ya...enjoy this bowl of cheese and beans bro. 

:( 









 I sure thought /r/NotTimAndEric would have appreciated this more than they did. 




 [you havent seen the worst/best of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_qAnO6-DdA feature=youtu.be t=98) 




 [are you prepared?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_qAnO6-DdA feature=youtu.be t=98)

 Yep, it's how dudes talk. 




 I don't know looks like they both did pretty well with it.  




 She has already asked for ranch 3 times. 




 'I've asked for ranch 3 times, Charles...is that our waitress coming?"

"I..I think...no no that's not her. Wait, I think that's her over there"

"No, Charles she right over there"

 




 beads? 




 lol. thanks i had forgotten about this song. he laughs a few times especially after he says the lyric aloud about bionic track suits or something...hilarious. 




 whats makes it ghetto? 




 eating nothing but eyepods 




 hhwhat hhare hhyou hhtalking hhabouthh? 









 what do you do when your mom isn't looking and dad isn't around? 




 What's up you boners?  




 Where in ct? Mouth of the CT river and the sound can be a great spot.  




 I'm so glad we all know that, now. Thank you.  




 The ine the guy in ops video it looked so loose.  




 Wow, I'd definitely click on that title.  




 Seriously, though.  




 do they actually produce notes, though? 




 sledding? 









 Whoa, from zero to even...i just can't.  




 My go to when I need a laugh.  




 Totes fetch  




 I've got to get rid of these cans!  




 Ya, turned back at that point. 
 




 reddit shit on him? You must be thinking of a different reddit. 




 or a Grateful Dead sticker. 




 much less polluted than ever before. 




 actually, it kind of does. Sorry. 




 In Connecticut didn't know there were franchises here.  




 Yep, I read that in Georges voice.  




 30 bucks for a pint of soup?  




 Like, any sport?  




 But...they all come back... Lol 




 My mom just went through radiation and chemo. Neither was painless to her...but better than the alternative.  




 Any better ideas?  




 love that sub. I do, right? 




 Imagining the horse laughing it's ass off at you. ;l 




 Easy does it.  




 Yep. Doesn't do shit for me.  




 Buttrock jeans?  




 Hey sorry just getting this. Parking should be not too bad now that the parade is over. Hitting up the festival and fireworks in Niantic today.  




 So you mean a regular Tuesday?  




 Don't do drugs- dude in video 

Thanks dude  




 **prince saunters in** 




 Ecstasy?  




 How world anyone know?  




 Good stuff dude. I'm not up where you are but I need to squash my issue now. Good to see this.  




 Ah, another Chester native. :)  




 /r/oldpeoplefacebook 




 I have it through my job but I personally pay 140 a month for medical and dental...well and also 401k and profit sharing. I live in Connecticut also if that means anything.  




 i had a colonoscopy last month. I have good insurance, not the best. I was put under (sort of) and all I got was a bill for 180. All of these recent posts about the healthcare in the US being outrageous is hilarious. While yes, it sucks here as opposed to other countries it's not nearly as bad as it comes off. I am in no way trumpeting what we have here but come on. 




 no, it's more than that but your buzzfeed comment gathers the upvotes lol. 




 i know the shortcut to screen shot but the editing tools dont let me do this. What is your go to? 




 man, I'm almost 3 minutes into it and I haven't even cracked a smile. What is the joke about being a kid and playing a song on a jukebox for hours on end is funny...besides the fact that it's kind of funny when you're a kid? 

I digress. Why are people laughing when he says that a small town restaurant is home to kids and (transients or something)? I must have missed that part of life. I'm from a small town but...still.

I understand everyone has their own taste and I suppose mine is completely different but I am still amazed that this is the top performance on this thread. I'm seriously questioning my humor.

I mean, shouldn't Kevin Harts Long Dick at least be above this? 




 stay of my websit CAncvl!!!@! 




 buzzfeed back on reddit? 




 Dads rule, moms...well actually rule but you know what i'm getting at. 




 what dd the do?

Okay, serious for a second. I thought about this because my mother is a prime example of /r/oldpeoplefacebook material, but I'll never share it...unless it's that golden.

How dd she mke fun of herr mom  ? 




 Man, I love my chromebook.  




 I was half expecting a picture of a dog with a boner. Where did everything go wrong.  









 Every year people from all around the world congregate upon the small town of Deep River to play, parade, and get publicly drunk. Largest gathering of it's kind in the world at least at one point...maybe still.

Tonight is the tattoo which is just a jam session on Devitt field and usually the most drunk night of the weekend. It goes until 2 am (so you still have time) but there is a camp and generally the town is cool with people partying all around until whenever. 

Tomorrow is when the parade is and the numbers really show up. It begins at 11 am. Then the rest of the day and  throughout the night again until 2 AM it rages on. 

Sunday usually has another jam session in the early part of the day and putters out in the afternoon. I won't be making it this year but I thought I would send the word out to you all if your looking for something unique to check out. 

If you do make it to the parade tomorrow be sure to look out for the Ancient Mariners. They have a guy chained up who they drag along as they drink heavily, beat the guy up, and shoot off cannons.  




 helo ? i ddnt sa helo. cancl!!!4! 




 Hackers bro.  




 Yep. Hey! Why don't you get off your lazy ass and just borrow money from your parents.  




  lol. I don't even recall that one but no its not where it began. ;)  




 Lol. Nice throwback. Do you know why I was told to fuck off? Gold if you do.  




 Like a child entering a conversation they know nothing about?  









 That sucks. My ex works in the public schools in New Haven and she always mentioned how awesome it was that Yale offered this for free. But kicking geriatrics out of a museum? Lol just kidding. I'm not that far from you. 

 




 where did the ball come from? 




 oh man. that so reminds me of being a kid. thanks for that. hours and hours outside doing cool bad shit.  




 /r/instantbarbarian? Can we start that? 




 kicked out? Wow. That's extreme.  




 Colbert joke?  




 what if I just have a naturally large nose? 




 I'm using a Griffin to go into my ipad. My electric guitar has been working just fine for months. I bought an acoustic pick up for my nylon. I got it all set, plugged her in and when I try to go to turn the monitor on it doesnt seem to recognize it...sort of.
I can see the light turn green so it's getting a signal but I dont have the option to turn the monitor on like when I use my electric. It is just giving me the option to use in interapp device.
anyone know whats going on?

I have also posted this in ipadmusic but thought I would check here as well. 

Thanks

GB

 I have a smart tv. A chromecast. A chromebook and a galaxy s4. Im pretty much set for whatever. I have Netflix, a previous HBO go login that still works and Amazon prime. Now, I just need to get sling for the months walking dead is on.  




 Huh?  




 Cheers.  




 Squirrel spine substitutes just fine. Trust me.  




 I mean...her name...  




 Well, I misjudged that...lol
 




 Lol. We should bring him under the deep docks.  









 Yes?  




 Uh, we kind of make front page fairly often when it comes to such a small state.  




 Plum Island, bro. Check it out and the location of it. Lol 




 Probably swam over from plum island. Lol

These two today will probably push us past 10,000 subs yipee 




 Probably swam over from Plum Island lol 




 Can you try the arrows for scrolling and get back to me?  




 Wait. Hold on. Raw turkey for Thanksgiving? Wha?  




 Do you have any lag issues with using the arrow keys for scrolling.  




 You fuck those chickens? You a chicken fucker?  




 I'm catering an event there soon. I'll see what I can do. I also know some fools involved with the place. Best of luck if I can't help though. :) 




 "reality" tv? No way Jose' 




 ...and it's also fake... 




 it sure does. 




 If you happen to have netflix can you go to season 1 episode 6 at about 29:00 and do you know who it is? It definitely has an Irish feel with the fiddle etc but the rhythm not so much. I've noticed that all episodes dont seem to list these songs. Maybe it's just a composer who does filler songs for the show I dont know.  




 Like cutting your arm off?  




 Watching Hell on Wheels right now and just heard that Soldiers Heart term...now I know the full context. 




 people are aware they are being filmed? 




 harry wet baals? 




 yah i recall seeing the dudes in the pilot seat from my apartment building. 




 Yep.  




 Hear hear.  




 Why would this make you leave?  




 You're serious?  




 check out what someone else replied to my comment with. it had me rolling. 




 Oh my god 




 cool. she answered my question in that ama as well. 














 ...with the sounds of the Griswolds... 




 I'm speechless. I never knew of this thing but of course it exists because I made some random 10 foot back pack comment and it seriously looks like it 10 ft. hilarious. thank you. 




 But...  




 We get earthquakes kinda often here in Connecticut.  




 I'm imagining like a ginormous back pack on you. What I mean is like 10 feet tall and 500 pounds.
