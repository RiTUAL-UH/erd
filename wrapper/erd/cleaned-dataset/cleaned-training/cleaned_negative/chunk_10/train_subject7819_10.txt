 Neat to watch how old but reliable these tanks are.  














 From /r/amifreetogo 

Police are not required to explain themselves or their actions to you or any other person they detain or arrest. A failure to explain their actions to a citizen, either out of malice or ignorance, does not mean a lawful order can be ignored. They are only required to justify their actions in criminal and/or civil court. Do not mistake a lack of explanation for a lack of grounds. Only refuse to identify yourself if you are absolutely certain you stand on solid legal ground.
Do not attempt to stand up to police officers if you aren't equipped with enough knowledge to make a safe determination of what you're legally required to do and are prepared to endure a false arrest and charges. Any and all resistance must be passive. Never physically resist an officer (exceptions for extraordinarily extra-legal actions notwithstanding). If your rights are violated, seeking compensation will be hampered by any "bad" behavior on your part. Don't make your lawyer's job harder than it has to be. 




 You can't self diagnose, a lot more people would have a different prison sentence for pleading mentally insane.  




 What rights does she have when pulled over? I know the officer said she was going to pull her out, I'd like to know a motorists rights when pulled over?  




 Haven't watched it all yet, but still wondering why she was arrested? Additionally, what an asshole, he quipped good when she said she was dazed and hurt after he slammed her to the ground.

 [Here's another shot] (http://imgur.com/gallery/rPeEIhE) from further back, I think photo shopping multiple photos would be quite an effort.  





























 According to jihadist groups "Al-Nusra Dzhabhat" was shot down near the settlement of Arafah in the mountain massif of Jabal Akrad:

This UAV is easily recognizable as the "Aileron-3CB" produced by "ENIKS." And this drone reportedly fell on the territory controlled by the government troops in the area known for last year's battles town Kessab : Fragments of such UAVs Ukrainians were presented as "downed Russian 'heads -10 ''









 




 This picture has been making the rounds the past few days.  No idea if this is real or a photoshoped, it was amusing enough to warrant sharing.  Our understanding is that the license plate on the truck is Belorussian.  The vehicle appears to be a [MT-LBu] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MT-LBu) of some sort.  Based on a quick search of the width of an MT-LBu and the height of the average semi-trailer, it seems plausible that the MT-LBu could fit inside a trailer as shown in the picture. 









 This seems too good to be true. Does anyone have any insight?

Launched from a tank cannon guided missile strikes 9M117M distant goal.
