 It'd be great if they had their own subreddit... nobody subscribes to /r/xboxone see these posts daily  




 it would be THE classiest dystopian movie ever or all dystopian movies

 the guy worships snakes   is a perv... screw what he thinks. he's a huge asshole. 

he made some great comics, true... but, he's not bulletproof with his opinion...there's plenty of great comic writers who can back up how much of a crazy fuck jerk Alan Moore is   shouldn't be worshipped... 









 it will the THE classiest White House in all the White House's... 









 guys, we don't need the EPA...the markets can monitor themselves.  




 Right now, I'd watch seasons 1 2 for sure... 3 is OK 




 is that at the Mega Lo Mart? Chuck Mangione there? 

 




 1 complaint? lucky... 




 GOP base loves Trump because hes a belligerent, loudmouthed racist just like them. Hes exactly the kind of person the Republican base consists of and identifies with - Paul Krugman


My main problem w/ Trump (  most of the GOP) is that he says these vague, broad brushed statements   how he'll fix them... but he doesn't say how. He's just bitching   not offering concrete solutions / plans / etc.  




 10-1 odds he's holding dog treats... 




 so, the guy from Kick Ass has a ring now?

 It'd be great if I could level up my weapons in PoE

Also, It'd be great if the kills added to my grimore score (Ogre kills, kills w/ ____ weapon, etc). 

I mostly play PoE all week, every week   yet I'm not getting a lot of credit for it...

 My fake ID name was Shep Boiardi  




 that last shot of Han sitting down at the Falcon... Oh Captain, My Captain!

 would be great if new content came out on the Halo Channel App simultaneously... ought to the THE place/hub for Halo content.  




 I watched... wasn't good. It was a spoof on all the (terrible) Lifetime movies, but it was as if Kristen/Will just inserted themselves in it. Wasn't funny except for the premise... 




 if so, cast a likeable kid  




 step 1) pay people the proper wages

step 2) then maybe we'll work more hours  




 I saw [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XLa2kEz2m4 feature=youtu.be t=16m13s) on the 'year one' video they put out today... I assumed we'd have something at the tower today.  




 they could create a virtual lobby system these games on a dedicate server, right? 

not only is it annoying, it's usually the main reason I quit playing. 

If you got a crew of non-quiters   people who's warm playing alongside you, it's actually the experience we're begging for 




 yes, the price is what was keeping me from purchasing it   not the lack of demand  




 both?

 you mean key chains   t shirts that're usually free marketing giveaways?  




 both of those pics are from Foo Fighters...  




 I'm an ambassador too...it's the cheapest labor MSFT can get away with...I can't believe they don't get flak from the gaming community. 

I feel like MSFT can afford someone to do that work for them. why would I volunteer to review gamertags for obscenities for an hour, answer support questions during my free time, etc... 

  as a consumer (  a M.B.A.), I don't feel comfortable that one of THE most successful businesses is outsourcing to fanboys  




 seriously, this needs to be it's own subreddit...  




 Insert .gif of Flair on his knees. Praying for forgiveness  then uppercut to sharks's groin... followed with a 'WOOOOOO' meme across screen  




 the DVD should have a feature the puts speech bubbles   yellow thought(s) on the screen...
