 It's cool 




 The animal that most closely represents your spirit or personality 




 I did that for another track, it turned out alright https://youtu.be/prjGhCfKLwE 




 It's OC, I made both the gif and the video https://youtu.be/IXZmW1BuU8Q 




 I make YouTube money on these videos, so it's a win-win 




 The track is 133.75 feet long and 6.1 feet high.  If a real roller coaster is about 100 feet high, then this roller coaster at 1/16 scale would be 2,192 feet long.  If it was 200 feet high, then at 1/33 scale it would be 4,458 feet long. 




 We bought 6 of the red track sets about four years ago, that's what you see in the gif.  I'm sure some people are selling individual parts online but I've never bought them like that.  The big sets are expensive but it's a very reusable toy.

 Blood doesn't always make everything scarier.  There's a Nostalgia Critic video about the Shining miniseries where he jokes about this https://youtu.be/EKufn-zGZCg?t=6m6s 




 On the feet, the pink stuff is adhesive for attaching the animatronic feet to the endoskeleton.  So I'd assume a lot of the other red/pink stuff is similar material 




 The lift is nuts but can we also talk about the non-inverting cobra roll?  Awesome! 




 Do you think there will be a decrease in future Gertslauer builds?  There are a lot of new ones popping up right now but they were already under construction 














 Nah, just trying to help you out

 It's still not in 1080

 Is it just me or is that a human skull behind his bow 




 So it's his own house... 




 Hallways at house

"What game are you playing?"

Bonnie in the distance

"What have you brought home?"

Bedroom with 2 doors and closet

"Close the doors"

Now go use all that in some conspiracy video 




 That's the whole point.  I think it is a good contrast to the all-out grittiness of 3. The environment appears a lot cleaner, brighter and safer, which provides a good contrast to the animatronics.   




 There don't seem to be any cameras in this game 




 I like how it looks a lot cleaner, brighter and safer than the other games.  A good contrast to the animatronics! 




 Does he make money off of YouTube advertisements?  I have AdBlock so I wouldn't know if he has them 




 It was fun but after a long day of coaster riding that sort of movement gets to you 




 That part hurts, too.  I dislike all of the rapid acceleration and deceleration changes on the ride, it feels unnatural and made me almost want to puke after I rode it twice. 




 I don't know but if you can tape the Kindle to the front of a train it would look cool!

Also you can use a tripod, that would be nice, and you can edit together some different angles using free video software like the YouTube editing tool. 




 I don't like surprise parties whether it's for me or for someone else.  I enjoy mysteries, such as something unknown to me that will definitely happen on an expected date, but I don't think it's fun when others purposely hide something from you.

I also dislike when someone says "I have something to tell you!"  Again, this is witholding information when they could just tell you.  I always like to stay informed...

I'm all for the suprises and adventures of everyday life but I don't think it's enjoyable when someone is plotting something to surprise you with, especially if both the information and timing is unexpected and especially if they expect you to react in a certain way.

Maybe INTJs just like to be in control or aware of situations as much as possible. 









 But I love Mean Streak so much just the way it is 




 I would upload images all day if that was the case 









 Awesome! 









 Amazing
