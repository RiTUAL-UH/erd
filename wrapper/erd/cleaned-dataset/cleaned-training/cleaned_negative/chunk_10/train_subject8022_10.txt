 Those kids are doomed. 














 The Eastern side of the state is getting hit particularly hard, including much of Idaho. It's really bad, but at the same time it's really interesting. If you like adventure, I highly suggest checking out some of the record low lakes and rivers around. Parts of the Snoqualmie river for example are a trickle right now in areas that'd be over a person's head in a normal water year. Keechelus Lake is another interesting place along I-90, and with its record lows right now it's a lot of fun to hike/explore areas usually under water this time of year. 

If we have another mostly snowless winter I think we'll be in super super bad shape. So hopefully checking out record low bodies of water is a limited time offer only. 




 After hearing interviews with Arnold lately my respect for him has grown substantially. I wish he could enter the presidential race, because out of everyone out there I think I'd trust him just about the most. He's incredibly pragmatic, and also understands people will not always agree and compromises are important. 




 Well that's another place to add to your list of where not to have a hangover. 




 I wish all wasps were this dumb. 




 Then I'd feed off of your thought reading by shouting out to all the other potential jurors not to worry because I was blocking your thoughts! 









 I think this one has earned its freedom. Set it free! 




 You should come to Idaho, here the rattlesnakes don't charge for bites. 




 They haven't tested it in animal models or humans. It's actual efficacy is unknown and to be determined. 




 Back then I should have, but now enough time has passed that I don't want to awaken that issue again. I find it concerning that there are people out there who get joy out of trying to ruin someone's life just because that person made a joke in bad taste (with no malicious intent, or intent to offend). I don't want them to start making things difficult for me again. 




 I don't have any reason to use alt accounts. And I think doing so would be childish. You called me paranoid? 

I feel like I'm just a regular guy living life. Which I intend to continue. I don't understand all the hullabaloo. 




 It bothers me that you appear to be one of "them"... But the reason was to get away from the brigading caused by one stupid comment. I was very active in programming and financial/investing subreddits where people had a lot of questions. I'd contribute efforts to help those seeking help, but when all my comments were downvoted by the SRS members it was a bad deal because it made my advice look like the wrong advice, and could have an impact on those asking for advice. It still doesn't make sense to me... This was a couple of years ago so maybe SRS has changed, but back then their actions were completely inappropriate imo. 




 Nope. Not a hate monger, creeper, or terrorist... Just guilty of making a joke of poor taste.

 




 SRS thrives on harassment and they really need to go... I had to create a new reddit account because I made a joke about feminists with my last one, not even meaning to offend anyone. There was a post about some misguided feminists at a rally that attacked a photographer for doing his job, and I posted a comment like "I volunteer to be the bus driver for the next rally... But our first stop will be a cliff.". SRS found out and followed me around downvoting me. They also doxxed me, found out where I worked, and tried to get me fired... All because I made a stupid comment which I don't think any reasonable person would associate with being serious.

This went on for months before I deleted my account, and it caused me a lot of stress. If that's not the definition of harassment I don't know what is. 




 If you don't trust the person you're sending them to you shouldn't be sending them. Extra protection behind two trusting parties isn't a bad thing. 




 Maybe I'm just cynical, but this posts extremely rapid rise to the top, and the title language smell a lot like a studio's doing to me. 




 Geologists hate him! 




 I think small drones with mounted projectile weapons will be the future of warfare. It won't be long before they start making appearances in insurgencies however, then regulators in the states will probably go nuts.

Or just imagine how much damage could be done with drones and explosives that have either encrypted / frequency jumping communication or pre-programmed GPS routes. It's a defense nightmare. About all you can do today is construct a giant net around what you're trying to protect, and even that isn't very feasible. 




 You don't. That's why this isn't that bad of a thing in my eyes. If it's a transfer between two trustable people using up to date software there is extra privacy, but if it's a company trying to limit viewing rights to their content, it's easy to get around. 




 This doesn't seem like a bad thing. It's really easy to circumvent if you really want too, but it also offers protection to common users who want their privacy.

Imagine the scenario:


**With protection on the image and platform**: Person A sends a 'personal' image to person B via email. The image is set to be viewed only once. Person B saves it to his hard-drive, and then opens it. The client/platform allows person B to view it, but it also triggers the image to become protected/encrypted. It is now no longer viewable. Person B sells the computer but unwisely does not erase his data. The buyer finds the image but cannot view it.

**Without protection**: Person A sends a 'personal' image to person B via email. Person B saves it to his hard-drive, and then opens it. Person B sells the computer but unwisely does not erase his data. The buyer is cleaning up data on the machine and comes across the image, opens it, and can view it. Now the buyer can post it on the internet, keep it on his machine for viewing, and just be generally creepy. 




 If they are trying to sell it, keeping their original costs a secret is a wise move. 




 If the earthquake doesn't get you the volcano will! 




 If this means shutting down subreddits that people find offensive, I can't imagine it going any way but badly. It's like prohibition, when you try to stamp something out it'll just become more rampant and harder to control... Those people in subreddits like r/coontown likely won't leave reddit, they'll just start posting their comments in other subreddits and threads. This may drive *other* people to leave instead. 




 You better hope your dad never gets his hands on a time machine... 




 They are called social justice warriors, and they are fighting a war!!!! /s 




 Hey guys, I think Ellen Pao killed JFK! 




 oDesk used to be very good. It has since been renamed to [UpWork](https://www.upwork.com/) . However with bidding sites such as that you'll likely find you are competing against many developers in other countries who are far more willing to work for less compensation.

If you don't want to start your own side project, one way to get side work is to post on sites such as Craigslist, and/or look for requests for help requests in the 'gigs' section. For example for Seattle, there are quite a few 'gigs' available: https://seattle.craigslist.org/search/cpg

Just be careful to not break any contracts with your employer, such as working on a project for competition.  




 I've screened a lot of resumes and done quite a few in-person interviews as a developer.

My suggestions (Specific):

* Instead of listing "C++/CLI" under languages just put "Managed C++". 

* For frameworks just put ".NET" instead of listing 4.0 and 4.5

* Drop the Methodologies bullet point. It doesn't really add anything useful.

* "real-time streaming SQL queries" seems like a poor description. I'd suggest something like "using SQL integration to display data"
* For the second job, combine the 2nd and 3rd bullet points.
* "The end result of the project would be a poker bot". This is a big red flag for me. You say "would be"? So this is an unfinished project I assume? If it is, either finish it, reword the description, or remove it all together. Personal projects are a huge bonus when I read resumes, but a single unfinished project gives me a negative perspective unless it's actively under development. 

For the short jobs, there isn't much you can do about that, just be honest. 
 
My suggestions (General):

* If you can list some accomplishments for your last job. Did you improve anything greatly while there?

 




 I hate paying tips because it's a big benefit to the employer (it's ridiculous that employers make customers pay for the fact they pay their employees shitty wages). But I do it anyway... If you don't pay tips you're hurting the people that are hard working decent people for the most part. I wish there was an easier way to stick it to the shady owners though... Maybe I should just start leaving with a trench coat full of silverware. 




 Hopefully people lay off of her now. She took the correct action of stepping down, and I hope we can all be thankful that she did, and wish her the best in whatever lays before her. 




 While the implementation itself may be proprietary, the concepts themselves are likely not. This seems common, especially in companies working on enterprise-level projects.

As long as you aren't stuck in maintenance mode (ie: not adding anything new, and not learning anything new about the projects) I don't think it'll do much to limit your career growth potential. I would suggest keeping yourself busy with side-projects wherever you can, just so you don't fall into a rut of not being motivated to learn anything new.  



















 Banana!  




 But there is a catch! A person having such thoughts would likely already be pretty conscious about the state of the world and ways to help it... which means most likely they would teach their kids to have similar perspective. So by not having kids, that person might be removing important problem solvers from the future.

Now, convincing someone else not to have children... 




 They have a metric butt ton: http://www.businessinsider.com/texas-has-no-place-to-put-its-650-million-stash-of-gold-2015-7 




 Texas recently ordered its state guard (a militia which reports to the governor) to observe the national and federal forces partaking in state drills, to ensure they weren't part of a coup against Texas and its people. They also just initiated actions to have all of their gold bullion moved from other states such as New York because they do not trust the federal government. Maybe next they'll announce they are seceding from the Union. 




 Except your post history has pictures like this with you stating it was after you "tucked your kitten in". Which means you lie about having a niece playing 'mommy' with the cat; and it also means you wrap your cats and take pictures of them. Which means... I'm slightly afraid of you. 




 Man, this chick really did win the genetic lottery. 




 I think part of the reason ageism exists is because unlike the case with young hires, with older hires there is usually a much longer paper trail and job/performance history. I think a lot of interviewers see an older person's resume and think "they aren't as far along as I think they should be after so many years in the industry", and conversely upon seeing a young person's resume they think "this person has worked a couple of years on satisfying projects, his future is likely very bright"... But the whole comparison is unfair, because the vast majority of tech workers won't accomplish something that is front page worthy in their careers. Yet that does not mean they aren't extremely good workers to have by your side. 




 I think he slides it in and it bends against his thumb around 1:14, he does an odd and very straight/smooth motion and even his facial expression changes like he is concentrating on something. 









 Yeah, I'm not sure if the guy in the videos has a really happy marriage, or if this is how news articles start. 




 I like how it makes an appearance in his next video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2dRqXz2Lrc 

 




 [OP's reaction](https://youtu.be/rB0wzy-xbwM?t=1m37s) 




 What's in that totally rock'in building? 




 He's well on the path to immortality. Let the genetic line continue 




 The FDA allows "compassionate care" use of previously unapproved treatments if it has a chance of improving the quality of life of someone who has a severely degraded quality of life or outlook. It's risky to drug manufacturers however, because if they attempt to treat patients too early, before doses/tolerance/safety are worked out in phased population studies, there is a chance it could make a patient's condition worse or even kill them. Such an event can put a real black mark on their ability to continue research and get approval in the future. 









 I was under the impression that in humans Alzheimer's most serious symptoms present themselves after the brain is already undergoing atrophy due to cell death. So is this model from the study more aligned with a very very early stage of Alzheimer's disease?  




 If you're living in Greece, that's actually not a bad idea... 




 I'm just going to sit on it, there aren't many options these days for something out of reach of risk related to a collapse in Greece and the cascading effects it may have. If I could I'd buy more property, but for now, I'll just check my account every 10 minutes on Monday and hope it doesn't drop too wildly. 




 That looks like a trip to the hospital. 




 What about when an FBI agent gives someone a fake bomb / nuke as part of a sting? It's not real either, yet they can be charged with that too. 









 No, I just hate most political discussions when they are circle jerks. I'm not one who would classify himself as Republican either.

I'm seeing politics posts all over the place in sub-reddits that used to be full of quality content. It wasn't much of an issue until r/politics got removed as a default sub, but then after that it began spilling out across reddit.

An hour before OP posted this, he posted another court article in r/politics. It's people trying to bring political discussions to subreddits that used to be mostly free of it. 




 Great if true, but considering the timing it's probably propaganda. Hopefully it actually works to sew some distrust between ISIS fighters. 




 I think today's terror in the news shows that god is upset with the world for allowing such a tragedy to take place. I only hope that those who were for it get a chance to redeem themselves before they burn in eternal **HELL**. I question what is next? Is this western drought going to be the end of our society as we get a taste of the flames that will lick our feet in the depths of the *underworld*?

Just kidding. Can we all get over stupid things to hate when there are so many more big/real problems lurking in our future? 




 /r/NotTheOnion is the new r/politics 




 You would have been close to the recommended maximum payload for sure. Looking at your truck's specs its bed is 4.8ft long (usable space), 56 inches wide, and has a depth of 18 inches. Subtracting 4 cubic feet for the wheel wells (it's likely more), and 2 cubic feet for the unused space on top we come out to about exactly 1 cubic yard. Since your soil looks dry and also uncompacted it's probably a few hundred less than the typical 2,000 lb for 1 cubic yard estimate.

Your truck's manufacturer lists a max recommended cargo payload of around 1400lb, which is likely very conservative (because lawsuits). 

With the weight being evenly distributed across the bed there shouldn't be any extreme stress on one particular point unless you're cruising around sharp corners at 30 MPH. 

When I lived/worked on a farm we would regularly exceed max payload specs as long as we kept the weight uniform and drove carefully. We never had any mechanical issues related to weight, and I don't suspect you have anything to worry about either. But I wouldn't recommend packing it down or taking wet soil and filling it to the top =) 




 The load on your truck should be fine. Just curious as to how much you figured the load weighed?

 









 Knowing Washington it was probably muggy as hell too. Looks can be so deceiving, I've made the mistake of trying to escape the heat with a pacific rain forest walk before... Nope! 




 Looks awesome and I'm also digging the straight forward construction (nothing weird / overkill). How long did it take you from start to finish? 




 This chick is like Goldilocks crazy. So crazy that what she does doesn't make any bit of sense to the typical non-crazy person, yet not crazy enough to be smearing feces all over the walls (yet).  




 This new study really hammers BPA safety.

It amazes me BPA hasn't been banned/regulated when it's well known to have detrimental health effects: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisphenol_A  




 I'm a software developer with a specific focus on automation systems, so if my job gets completely automated I'd say it's great progress on behalf of humanity.

Such a change in the way we work as a society will not be easy, but I think it's necessary and though it may take centuries, it will be well worth it to future generations.  




 This is just a straight up r/politics post.  




 Then we should take those people out of the system with today's economics if we want to maintain a stable world. Our efficiency and automation is exploding, and so is our population... It's destined for disaster in the long term, and something will have to change, our economy is ripe for change, but nobody wants to be the first to do it, and I don't blame them. I think we'll start undergoing an evolutionary step in the way we work and function as a society. 




 Most of the process of 'cooking' the food at places like McDonald's is automated, but they still use people to move it along those steps and put it all together in the end. Those people likely won't be going away anytime soon.

Eventually they likely will, but there is a lot of regulation needing to be defined and cleared up before completely automated food (no humans preparing the food in the restaurant)  becomes a reality. 




 Not necessarily. I don't go through self-checkout when I have a lot of items simply because I'm not nearly as efficient as the baggers. I love self-checkout when I'm just getting a few things, but when you have a full cart load of stuff they suck (in my opinion). 




 You are correct, most SSDs are spec'd with the goal of having no less than 3 months of non-powered data retention. The fact that the threshold is so low says something about the data retention ability of current SSD tech. 




 I hear Guantanamo is nice this time of year.  




 They are all shopping at Walmart. 




 Ooooooooo... Japan gonna get banned!!!! 




 With this technique could it eventually be expanded to bone fragments by you or others? Could someone fake a death and leave behind fabricated skeleton remains that match the genetic profile of the "victim"? 




 Do you have an example of a limiting regulation that is unrelated to safety and infrastructure? I'm genuinely curious. When I talked to one of the city managers he said it was extremely rare for a proposed project to be rejected. But of course that doesn't mean there aren't builders that want to build, but just never submit a proposal. 




 No, I'm saying Seattle isn't really doing anything to hold back builders. So while some Seattle neighborhoods may complain about change of neighborhood character, it isn't holding builders back from record setting development. 




 Oh thank god, that makes a lot more sense. My mistake. 




 Seeing the lake 22 feet below it's regular surface would be an interesting sight for sure...

The locks raise the water level by ~20 feet so to lose all of that would imply there was almost no inflow at all. Is that expected? If so does anyone know if water restrictions are planned to maintain the Cedar River flows? I've lived here for about 10 years and there haven't been any water restrictions during that period, are watering restrictions super rare in this area?

 




 I remember reading somewhere that 2015 already has more units approved for construction than all of 2014 (which was already an active year). The boom is happening, but it's nowhere near enough to bring prices down. Seattle is now estimated to be adding nearly 30k people to its population each year, but suburbs are of course adding many more than that so demand for housing in the city is continuing to rapidly rise and likely will for a long time in the future.

Builders have every incentive to build right now, and I think they are building as fast as they can. There is just such an influx of people wanting to move to Seattle there is no way they can keep up with their current staffing and building capabilities. I'm not sure what more the city of Seattle can do to increase construction. 




 It was all fun and games until I started to scroll down and got shot before reaching the last link. 




 Maybe there was a Taco Bell nearby 




 From what I've read this falls outside of the realm of false advertising because it has no impact on the product and service itself. It seems to be a gray area. Some other laws may catch it however. 




 I know it is likely unethical, but is it actually illegal if there are no investors and the company is private? It's not for tax purposes either, but simply because due to the nature of the business a higher  previous customer count is incredibly crucial to gaining more customers.

For example, say I start a security system company. If I were to say "More installations than any other security provider!", is that illegal if it is not true? Just to clarify, I'm not asking about ethics here but rather the legality of it. 




 Baggy eyes, pale, transfixed stare, and sweaty looking. The joyous hallmarks of sleep deprivation and stress. He's probably counting down the hours before he can be back in his own bed.
