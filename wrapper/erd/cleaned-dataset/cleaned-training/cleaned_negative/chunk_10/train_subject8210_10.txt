 You'd have to have a screw loose to enjoy hell.

As crazy as it is, when one gets back to the "real world" some wish they could get back to the lunacy.  Hard to explain, I don't understand it, but I sometimes wish I was back in Iraq.  Not that I "enjoyed" it per se, but there was nowhere near as much drama or bullshit that you find here in the "real world."  It's comforting but maddening at the same time.

 The criminal justice system is designed to fuck people like this man.

Which of the charges below are "designed to fuck" with this guy?

three counts of assault in the fourth degree

one count of disorderly conduct in the second degree 

one count of theft in the third degree 

one count of resisting arrest 

one count of interfering with a police officer

I'm assuming you'll at least say the bottom two because, well, reddit is all about anti-authority and everything.  Nevermind that he was apparently whacking customers with this thing.   




 please don't procreate

Already did. You're grounded.  




 Does it really fucking matter? 




 You've got [plenty of posts](https://www.reddit.com/user/RedditHypocrite) where all you're doing is bitching and moaning in TIL posts about the content/subject.  If it bothers you that much, remove it yourself from your own "default" or just be a grown up and move on.

If however you just like to troll and complain, then fist yourself. 




 Great.  Thanks for admitting that and letting me know that anything you post is unreliable.  [I wish you luck in your future endeavors.](http://i.giphy.com/fAGln5qp01U9q.gif) 




  Edit:Going to take your advice though. I shall ignore you now 

So what you're saying now, is that you can't be trusted as you're not a man/woman of your word and are a liar? 




 So people shouldn't talk about places they've never been to? 




 The action did not in anyway indicate me being upset. 

OK

That is in your mind, think what you want.

I will.

Also, rules and etiquette are two separate things. 

Nothing in etiquette against reposts either.  There is against those who complain about them though.

Poorer arguments on top of poor assumptions. Nice.

You get butthurt over reposts.  On reddit.  That's pretty much all anyone needs to know.

And lead by example in this specific case. 

Again. This is reddit.  You take this too seriously.   

 If you wanted me to ignore the post because it was repeated and i am being immature by stating it here, you are setting yourself up in the same area by replying to my 'repeated' comment. 

OK

You are just moving in circles not even realizing that you are calling yourself immature. 

Your deflection attempts are amateur.

A sad life, if you have nothing better to do in your break. 

Coming from the guy who gets butthurt over reddit reposts.  And then reposts comments.  And again, the amateur deflection is just that, amateur.

And i applaud your originality in the style of your reply and coming up with this form of circular arguments. Bravo, the man with all the originality of the world is here!

Thanks!

Edit:Going to take your advice though. I shall ignore you now :) Again, fuck you.

OK! 




 [Learn the rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/wiki/index#wiki_rule_.233.3A_no_news_or_recent_sources.) before spouting off at people "buddy."

This rule does NOT mean that posts that contain links to news articles over 2 months old are not allowed.
 




  which in itself is a poor assumption

Actions speak louder than words.

How about you getting riled up on a repeated comment which you deem insignificant anyway. 

Oh I'm not riled up at all.  I'm merely mocking you while taking a break during my work day.

You should have followed your own advice and ignored my comment then!

So you're not going to be a grown up and just ignore things and instead lead the charge to get OPs to remove re-posts even though there is no rule against them?  [Sounds awesome!](http://i.giphy.com/4bMAaXendmGWc.gif)

Lead by example.

Seriously?  Lead what?  Redditors?  Yeah.  OK.

But you had to reply.

Yes.  Because you people amuse me.

Looks like you are just a hypocrite. 

OK

Or would that be Captain hypocrite to you? 

Lacking originality.

I would rather have another deserving post taking up space than a repost of something posted not even a day.

That's why they have up/down vote buttons.  Guess what?  Not everybody saw it the first time around.  Just because you did doesn't mean anything.  Downvote and move on.  You're not some white knight saving the reddit universe.  

People repost after 3-4 months. Cool. Heck, even after a month.

Good for you.  As much as your narcissistic self won't like hearing this, you don't set the standards for others.

But that day itself. That is shitty. 

So what?  I didn't see it the first time around.  I know I'm not the only one.

Obvious stated or do i need reiterate for you?

Is that even a sentence?

Edit: Seems like OP got the message. Fuck you :) 

Still lacking originality.

 




  News and any sources (blog, article, press release, video, etc.) more recent than two months are not allowed.

Did you read the entire rule?

News and any sources (blog, article, press release, video, etc.) **more recent than two months** are not allowed. 




 A repeated comment and a Repost are not the same things. 

Both are insignificant.

You got your thoughts mixed up.

Nope.

This is a concern.

Seriously?  It's reddit.  Calm down.

That is a title post. 

Thanks Captain Obvious.

The more people point it out the more likely OP will be to rescind the post. 

Or you could just, you know, be a grown up and ignore it.  There is no rule against re-posts after all.  

Though, looking at your stance, i can understand if that explanation sails over your head.

My stance is that you need to step away from the computer and experience more of the real world if a repost upsets you this much. 




 This has already been brought to the attention of the OP.  Did you search the comments to make sure you're not making a repost by stating this? 



















 What the hell does it matter?  That was 11 hours ago.  Do you think that the same exact people, no more/no less, are the only ones that will see this one?  I for one didn't see the one that was posted last night.  And not knowing it in the first place, I certainly wouldn't have gone browsing TIL to locate it either.

Technically he's a contender.  In reality he'll eventually fizzle out.  Personally, I believe he's got some ulterior motive going on that we don't know about yet that will help him make more money.  That's what he is, and always has been, about.

 This is the type of crap that annoys me.  What it boils down to is not whether or not someone is a veteran but rather what party the person doing the attacking or being attacked is in.

These outbursts about giving respect to vets has gotten very old, very fast.  If any of these politicians give one damn about our vets, I don't give a fuck what party the politician is in, they would step up and take action to actually help our vets and not use them as a political tool.  The reason veterans are veterans anyway is because the politicians couldn't do their job.

Soon after the Japanese attacks on Pearl Harbor, the college requirement for pilots was dropped. McMahon immediately enlisted and entered flight training in Dallas, Texas. Afterwards he completed fighter training in Pensacola and obtained his carrier landing qualification. While he was still in flight school, McMahon became an instructor, a role in which his ability to project came in handy. His flight instructor status lasted for two years until he was given orders to report to the Pacific Fleet. However, before he entered combat, atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki which ended the war, and facilitated the cancelation of his orders.

Although the war ended, McMahon continued his service in the Marine Reserves as an officer. Once the Korean War began, McMahon's active duty status was reinstated. His primary role during that war was to fly Cessna O-1 Bird Dogs as a spotter for batteries and Navy and Marine fighter bombers. He flew a total of 85 combat missions and earned six air medals. He retired in 1966 with the rank of colonel.

 You still haven't shown how they are obviously paid for. I'm not asking for a "how to" on marketing. I'm merely asking a simple question.

 obvious paid placements

Just because it's on there doesn't mean it's "obvious" it was "paid" for.  In regards to the JD one anyway, haven't read the other.

Mentioning that a company gives away a bottle of JD, to its employees and not customers, is certainly not going to do anything to promote a product.  "Oh wow, they give away stuff to their employees?!  Let me go buy some!"

Additionally, let's take a look at /u/jrcollin138's submission history.  Over two years, at least, of posts/submissions and he/she lives in Connecticut.  I can't imagine someone building up an account for a couple of years just waiting for the right moment to make that JD post.  

Stating that it's an "obvious paid placement" comes off as /r/conspiracy.  Amazingly enough, some people just find things out and find them interesting. 

In regards to the Conan one, what about it tells you it was a paid spot?

Rice was associated with a variety of charitable organizations during his career, primarily on behalf of children, some of which have carried on into his retirement. He was named an honorary chairman of The Jimmy Fund, the fundraising arm of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, in 1979, and in 1992 was awarded that organization's "Jimmy Award", which honors individuals who have demonstrated their dedication to cancer research. Rice is also active in his support of the Neurofibromatosis Foundation of New England. Rice's involvement with Major League Baseball's RBI program (Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities) resulted in the naming of a new youth baseball facility in Roxbury, Massachusetts in his honor in 1999. A youth recreation center in Rice's hometown of Anderson, South Carolina is also named in his honor.

Rice's most notable humanitarian accomplishment occurred during a nationally televised game on August 7, 1982, when he rushed into the stands to help a young boy who had been struck in the head by a line drive off the bat of Dave Stapleton. As other players and spectators watched, Rice left the dugout and entered the stands to help 4-year old Jonathan Keane, who was bleeding heavily. Rice carried the boy onto the field, through the Red Sox dugout and into the clubhouse, where the young boy could be treated by the team's medical staff.

Despite this, the Pennsylvania Dutch, which includes Amish, Old Order Mennonite, and Conservative Mennonites are expected to become a smaller percentage of the population as the sects respond to high prices of farmland by spreading out all over the United States and internationally, and the English population spreads out from Philadelphia into suburban and rural areas.

 A House committee and at least two states have opened investigations into Planned Parenthood following the release of an undercover video that shows a Planned Parenthood executive graphically discussing the process of aborting a fetus in a way that preserves its organs  and the costs associated with donating those organs to medical researchers.

Sounds to me like Planned Parenthood was doing what they should do, provide information about services.

The boombox quickly became associated with urban society, particularly African American and Hispanic youth. The wide use of boomboxes in urban communities led to the boombox being coined a "ghetto blaster", a nickname which was soon used as part of a backlash against the boombox and hip hop culture. Cities began banning boomboxes from public places, and they became less acceptable on city streets as time progressed.

The boombox became intrinsically linked to hip hop culture and, as Fab Five Freddy puts it, was "instrumental" in the rise of hip hop. Certain models like the JVC RC-M90 and the Sharp GF-777 were known as the boombox kings, having the power to drown out other ghetto blasters; they were frequently used in music battles. The Beastie Boys embraced the boombox as a signature, The Clash always had a boombox with them, and Schoolly D carried around a Conion 100cf in the UK.

Previous attempts to use video games to halt, or even reverse, cognitive decline related to aging have generated mixed results. The latest attempt, led by neuroscientist Adam Gazzaley from the University of California, San Francisco, kept it simple by targeting a single cognitive skill: multitasking. In a study published Wednesday (September 4) in Nature, Gazzaley and his colleagues demonstrated that a handful of training sessions behind the wheel in a 3-D racing game could improve multitasking performance, and that such improvements lasted up to six months.

Gazzaleys group developed the game, called NeuroRacer, to test the multitasking abilities of subjects ranging in age from 20 to 70. NeuroRacer requires players to steer a car around a winding track with a finger on their left hand while signaling the presence of randomly appearing road signs of a particular shape and color with a finger from their right. The researchers found that initial game performance declined linearly with increasing age.

After playing the game for just 12 hours over a four-week period, 60- to 85-year-old subjects improved to the point that they outperformed 20-year-old subjects who had never played it before. The observed performance improvements lasted for six months following the initial training.

Certain cognitive abilities that were not specifically targeted by the gamesuch as working memory and sustained attentionwere also improved among the older subjects. NeuroRacer doesnt demand too much of those particular abilities, Gazzaley told Nature. So it appears that the multitasking challenge may put pressure on the entire cognitive control system, raising the level of all of its components.

Gazzaley cautioned against over-hyping his teams results: Video games shouldnt now be seen as a guaranteed panacea, he told Nature.

Other scientists are taking a wait and see approach. The science is still too early to know how much it can help, Douglas Gentile, head of the Media Research Lab at Iowa State University, told The Wall Street Journal.

Emil Toescu, a neuroscientist at the University of Birmingham, agreed. The technology is not yet sufficiently proven to recommend itself for immediate adoption by older people, he told The Telegraph. But, on the other hand, a moderately complex gaming experience is always good fun, whatever the age, and it cannot do damage.
