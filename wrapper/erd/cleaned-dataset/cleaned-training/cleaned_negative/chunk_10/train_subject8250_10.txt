 Thanks!! Oh jeez, you've got me stumped. I was going to say pita chips, but I guess that constitutes as bread as well. Honestly, if you really feel like eating it and don't have a substitute for bread, you can totally just use a fork/spoon and eat it! My sister dove into it after a while, she couldn't hold back! I hope that helps a bit, I can't think of much else besides bread or some type of chip! 




 Made a quick feta dip for my sister's birthday! I drowned it in olive oil a bit too much, but it was delicious.

 I drowned it a bit too much in olive oil, but the taste was incredible. My sister found it off of Pinterest, so I made it for her birthday!

 As a redditor who just purchased a new car about a month ago, I would love to see an answer to this. I had a mini heart attack from the dealership all the way back to my house.  




 Exercise. I am by no means fat or overweight, and I've been into athletics and whatnot my whole life. I still to this day hate anything to do with exercising. I do not understand how people find enjoyment from it.  




 Throw a ball. I grew up playing hockey as a goalie. I can hardly even shoot a puck.  




 "Baaaaaah,"-ing like a goat  




 Alcohol poisoning for the win.  




 Am I real?
