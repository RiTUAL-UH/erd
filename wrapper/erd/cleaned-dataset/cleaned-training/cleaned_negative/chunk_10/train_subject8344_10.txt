 Doesn't have a chance. Just another attempt to break up the solid blue state. It's just gerrymandering in disguise. 









 What a surprise. This is legalized grand theft.

 He's actually right about that.  




 Amen. 




 If you are white. 




 Well if you don't have any, who needs a board for it? 




 Obama is racist..., now give us money.  




 Trump supporters are limited. The are the extremist on the right side. Sure he has them but that is as far as it will go. When the  other candidates drop out, their support will not go to Trump.  




 Donald Trump believes in Donald Trump. 




 Here here!

It is insane to do the same thing over and over and expecting different results. When the rhetoric dusts settles down in the years to come, history will show Obama had the right approach and he will be remembered for it. That is unless we elect Scott Walker and he goes to war with Iran on day one of his presidency.

We have been doing this for decades and it had been a total failure. The time has come to put an end to this insanity. 




 Thank you. Your post is all set. Good luck. :D 




 I am sorry this happened to you. The administrators should restore your account.  Let me know how it turns out.

 I am really sorry but we have some viscous trolls here that have nothing better to do than hurt people. We just ignore them.

But there is another problem. There is one guy that is reporting all our newer users as spammers even though they are not spamming and unfortunately  he got you shadow banned.

 Thank you. 




 Good. Let me know what happens. So sorry this happened.  




 No worries. It will not happen. The only thing Donald is doing is helping the democrats. This fringe element of the GOP of course like this guy. It's the same people who support Tea Party nut jobs. But numerically it is impossible for Trump to win the presidency.

 There is no conspiracy. It is one person.

 Not true. The bot is not that specific. 




 We have operated for five years and all of a sudden this guy starts reporting all our users. One person. I have asked him to stop but he told me to suck his balls. He is targeting our subreddit specifically.

 God how many articles do we need about the attendance numbers of a Bernie rally? Of course they will continue to get bigger. That's how it works or they are toast. But we don't 20 posts a day telling us this. This is not news.

 Sure. I will PM it to you. 




 Looks like they are having a bit of a drought too. 




 I don't know if this would work but how about using a carpet shampooer. 




 http://cutecaptions.com/images/reddit-meet-lemondrop/ahhhh-i-want-my-mommy.jpg 




 Since when is not okay to say stewardess? I didn't get memo. Apparently I have been offending stewardesses for years now. 




 Sounds like the premise for a sequel to another "Ghost" movie. 




 I have not got a response from him yet. So I am thinking if you could send me a copy or screenshot of that contract you had him sign. Also let me know what state you are in. The next step I am considering is small claims. Having a contract will make that much easier and give us a much better chance of winning. 




 You'd think, huh? 




 Karma, karma, karma, karma, karma, 




 Why would it be? 




 You are so young. If you aren't married yet these could be the best years of your life. 




 Get your GE out of the way as fast as you can. 

And the most important class you will ever take is you internship. Get one at a good place where you make contacts. 




 Bitch 




 Howling black mobs? 

Wow, you actually out-editorialized the Daily Caller. I did not think that was possible. 




 I agree. I just want to see the circus Donald will undoubtedly bring to the debates. 




 Because  of the public. 




 Haven't heard about that. I hope not. I am looking more forward to this than I did Game Of Thrones. 




 Okay there Cletus. 




 Oh you know they will do their best to get it. 




 Yes each one will get bigger. That is how it works. Now  can we  stop posting  attendance stats. It's getting real boring and is not news.

 Yea it's like a Justin Beiber  attraction. It'll pass. 




 Yes we call them our Cat-alytic converters

Forgive me for that joke. 




 I know. It's just the Bernie Army is  all excited. The Clinton folks will appear once the race gets going. It's just like last time with the Ron Paul armies. Quite annoying but they are entitled.  




 This sounds like a project he would do. He is very good and very fair. He can give you either a time bid and you pay materials, or a bid for the whole package. What city are we talking about? 




 That's cool. If the Latinos get out and vote, they could make a huge difference.

 I wouldn't miss it for anything. It's going to be a circus and a half. :D 




 Getting a little bored of these attendance reports every week. Of course each one is going to be bigger. So what.  It means nothing.  




 Not really. A few features are very handy for modding but for the money it does not offer a lot for a regular user. 




 I am working on this apple. Would welcome any suggestions you have.  




 I will do my best and will keep you informed. 




 I do as well. Pretty much the only other alternative is another quagmire of war. It's time for that to stop. I was just making light of Ron giving his blessing, like it was  was actually worth something. 




 Oh I have that already. I meant what was the agreement of how he would pay it back. 




 They are not injecting it. It's just a crane boom to pour it as usual. It pumps it to the top but is only filling a hole using gravity. 




 Well I'll  let you know right after we get rid of ISIS. That will only takes us a couple days. 




 I always travel through Tahoe when I am off to for desert camping trip in the winter. I just love it there. Retirement is calling me there. (someday) 




 Thank you. I will see what I can do to resolve this. 

Could you PM me the arrangement you made with him so I know the details. 




 Can you please tell us who it is? 




 Oh yea. I love Tahoe! 




 Ughh! Well it's an El Nino year so keep your fingers crossed. 




 Woo Hoo! Sorry I missed that! 




 Tahoe is very special in a lot of ways. 

* The water in Lake Tahoe could cover a flat area the size of California to a depth of 14 inches. This is enough to supply everyone in the United States with 50 gallons of water per day for 5 years. And believe it or not, the amount of water that evaporates from the surface of Lake Tahoe every year could supply a city the size of Los Angeles for 5 years.

* Tahoe has never frozen over. Waters are so cold in Lake Tahoe, staying a constant 39 degrees. The Lake Tahoe Basin has its share of below-freezing days and nights, but surprisingly enough the Lake itself has never frozen over. On occasion, Emerald Bay has been covered with a layer of ice, and ice also forms in cold protected inlets. However, Lake Tahoe's great depth and volume of water is always in motion and keeps it from being the world's largest ice rink.

 




 Hey for us it was a monsoon. :D 




 How big of a job we talking about? I know a great guy (I work for him) but it has to be big enough to keep a couple guys busy for at least one day. He is a contractor and does excellent work.  




 Albertsons - I got fired from there years ago. 




 I liked his answer. It is actually the only real one that should be given. He had nothing to apologize for. 




 Because then there would be no need for religion. 




 Only me and Donald Trump know. 

Muhawhawhawhawhawhawhaw! 




 Early morning drama turned into finding out that the head gasket on my car wasn't blown  like the mechanic said it was. (never going to that mechanic again)

Ended up being a good day. 




 Well great. Since Ron is okay with it, let's do it already. :D 




 :D 




 You mean there still is a Northern California? Oh my god, the rumors are not true. Praise the lord! 




 Laugh, laugh, laugh. 

This is the most right-wing twisting of a story I've seen today. What a joke. It will effect all government employees if the republican led congress does not pass a budget. Of course you are already trying to blame Obama for congress not doing their job. 

Try posting news next time and not this Heritage Foundation spam next time.

 Ouch. Yea they really burn you on the price. But I love mine. It was way cheaper because I have a pretty small space to fill. But no fuss- no muss. :D 




 **POST REMOVED BY OP's REQUEST** 




 It's kind of expensive but I like the no-mow part. :D 




 I hope so. Doesn't do that much good for it to rain here except for golf courses.  




 done 




 I just don't have grass anymore. Replace it with fake stuff.  No-mow Joe they call me. (well not really) 




 I bet. For us it is like a hurricane. We haven't seen it in so long. Big for us. Probably sprinkles to those in the mid-West. But we'll take it. :D 




 Yea I am a user myself. It's a hard road to travel. 




 Oh too late. The rain stopped. 




 Sure is. I just witnessed a cloudburst in my town. It was glorious! 




 2nd deepest freshwater lake in the United States.  









 That's actually a good question. 




 Bless you and bless your best buddy.  




 I do. 




 I believe in something. I kind of doubt it is individual out there but I think there is definitely some higher power out there.  




 More power to them. And not those jobs should not be reserved for the young. That would be absurd, not to mention illegal. 




 Did he get the job?

 We can't handle handle the rain. We hadn't seen it in so long, we had to just had to stop and look at it. 




 What is insane is that people actually eat this stuff up. Ten years ago statements like that would have ended a career. Now it puts you in first place for the GOP nomination.
