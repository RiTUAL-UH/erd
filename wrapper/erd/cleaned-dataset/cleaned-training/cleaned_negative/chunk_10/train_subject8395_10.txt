 Ahhh but this is the question? Can you separate the art from the artist especially with the crimes he has committed?  




 Agreed but lets have some faith. Chinatown has just been nominated which is a classic that not many people have seen before. I aim to bring up some different films as well. 









 CHOO CHOO. Off I go. 




 **Rush** Dir Ron Howard. A really engaging film about Formula 1 drivers and their death defying rivalry. The film was a high octane story that constantly changed how you felt about the characters throughout. 




 Snowpiercer, Leviathan and For Those In Peril. 




 The most unbelievable part of this video is that Vin Diesel has a large amount of hair. 




 Funny you should say that. They are releasing a remake of Point Break but I don't think it will be anything like the original.

 Nothing like a good ol' meatspin. 




 I don't think this I just used the title of the article. I just thought it was an interesting piece of tech. 




 Thats the plan.  




 Hmm that is definitely something worth thinking about. Will be a while yet until we are able to find out its flaws/perks. Interesting step forward though as well as a good price they were suggesting.
