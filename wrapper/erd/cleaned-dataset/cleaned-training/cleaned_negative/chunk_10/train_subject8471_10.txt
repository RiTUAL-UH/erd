 Just saw that one today.  They had a great one last Fathers' Day.  Something along the lines of Scotch helps a dad forget his disappointment in his children. 




 I mis-read as "fighting ISIS in your location." 







































 High-end mechanical watches; you're supposed to get them serviced every five years or so.  My Omega just stopped working for no reason, and I had to send it in for $500 worth of repairs.  Seriously considering selling it.

 Seriously, I mean, you weren't even alive then.  You had nothing to do with it.  But the evidence is just irrefutable.  As an American I have no problem acknowledging our own genocide of Native Americans.  I wasn't there.  I didn't do it. 




 Honestly, everything else comes in at least two sizes: fries, wings, drinks.  But I have **never ever** seen the option to order large or small onion rings. 




 With apologies to Stephen Wright. 




 ... all day breakfast?  I don't have that kind of time. 



















 Is it really my kid? 




 The barber asked if I wanted my eyebrows trimmed :( 




 Either an egg, dumplings, or some sliced pork; mushrooms; frozen green beans or spinach added at the last minute so they stay crisp; maybe dried seaweed; and kimchi as a topping.  Sometimes I'll add Sriracha and Soy Sauce.  Quick, yummy, satisfying, and cheap. 














 I guess these aren't "real" Muslims either. 









 I've been working at Tufts for almost two years, and I'm pretty sure they break out the good stuff for Spring Visit and Fall Orientation, when parents bring their precious snowflakes to visit/stay.  Otherwise we suffer with the see-thru TP.  Note, this is in the admin buildings that parents are likely to visit.  In the class buildings it's all suck-tp all year round. 














 I would have posted about [Caffe sospeso](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caff%C3%A8_sospeso) ... but then I probably wouldn't have gotten as many upvotes :)

 Useless!?!  Memorizing good poetry is never useless!  Case in point: one day I was walking with a friend in some terrible winter weather.  He remarked how cold it was, and I said, "If our eyes we closed, then the lashes froze 'til we sometimes couldn't see.  It wasn't much fun but the only one to whimper was Sam MgGee."  English Major friend was impressed, and it brightened our day a little bit.

 Honestly, when I first saw [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2lntrx/former_prisoners_of_reddit_what_is_something_that/) that's how I read it. 




 You are right, they are super-protective of the brand.  I am actually paying royalties to Magister LaFleur and the Wheelock sisters :)  They are very excited about the app and it's linked from the [website](http://wheelockslatin.com/) 




 ... and of course the photo they show is Barnes   Noble, one of the chains that will be *closed* on Thanksgiving.

oh, wait.  I misread the title :) 




 Well, the free versions only goes up to chapter 5.  The full version is $9.99

 Say "what" again, motherfucker! 




 So this guy moves into a new neighborhood, and his next-door neighbor comes over to welcome him.  He says, 
"Hey, I'm having a party tonight, wanna come over?  There'll be plenty of drinking, drugs, and wild sex!"  
They guy says, "Sure.  What should I wear?"
"Wear whatever you want, it'll just be you and me!" 




 And Rick never said, "Play it again, Sam." 




 I mean, seriously, what is wrong with you?  How is this **ever** an acceptable alternative?
