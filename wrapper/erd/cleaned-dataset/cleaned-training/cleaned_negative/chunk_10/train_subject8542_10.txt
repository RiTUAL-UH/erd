 Ever had that feeling that somethings watching you? Even though you know nothings there?
I found something - or should I say, something found _me_, and.. I can see _it_

I dont know how I got away from it. Its been with me for months now, it knows where I live, where I work.. everything. It follows me, wanting to touch me. I dont know what it wants with me, but I know its bad. because _it_ doesnt want to be seen.

I suppose I should start with who I am and what I do, it might make sense then.

Im a van driver. I know, not exactly the most exotic or exciting of professions, but hey, it gives me time by myself to sing at the top of my lungs, or just to think. With home life going crazy at the moment, its nice to be alone. I can drive hundreds of miles a day sometimes; heck, sometimes Im away from home for weeks on end.. Like now.

Ill start at the beginning - but I can only hope that I can finish it before it finds me again.

It all started a few months back - as usual, I was driving around, listening to music, or the radio, I cant remember.. I usually listen to Jeremy Vine during the day if I can, otherwise I just put on some of my usual music. 
One of my last jobs that day was at an old house - I think it was the house of some accomplished author, I didnt really pay too much attention - it looked like it had been refurbished to accommodate tours, but the entrance for loading was down in the basement, using a ramp down to an open door.

Despite its new refurbishment, when I entered the basement, it still looked.. old. It creeped me out a little bit, it was still dark, and there was a biting chill in the long corridor. I buzzed the button and waited for my contact to come find me. 

In the corner of my eye, I saw a shadow.. peeking around a corner - I thought there might have been stairs there, and my contact was making sure I was there. When I twisted my head to look and wave her down, it was gone. 

Hello?

Nothing.

I shook my head and noted that I should stop letting my imagination get away with itself. It was only a few seconds before I heard a loud groan and a screech in front of me. My ears tingled and I stepped back, goosebumps appearing on my skin, before I realised the lift was coming down. Knowing it was the person I was waiting for, I stepped back outside and opened the back door of the van, ready to offload a few bits and pieces of equipment.

After boxing up a lot of things, I offered to take the lot upstairs and take it to the room the person needed. I left the van open, as I was only going to be a few minutes at most, and this place was in the middle of nowhere. Itd be fine, and the van was empty anyway. Any would-be-thieves would be disappointed.

I spent 4 or 5 minutes unpacking all the items, before heading back down to the van and waving goodbye.

It was a few weeks after that before I started noticing the shadow a bit more.
Sometimes, Id feel something behind me while I was driving. I knew the back of the van only had empty boxes or my laptop sat inside a bag under my seat, I never let anyone in the back - it was too dangerous, and I am a stereotypical van driver - quite nutty on those left turns.

I saw it most at my home though, but Ive always had weird experiences at my place, but Ive always put it down to sleep paralysis or just my imagination running wild, as usual. Shadow men approaching me as I lay in bed, but the shadow.. figure was being spotted not just by me, but by the family. Itd hide in cupboards, outside in the shed, stood in the garden staring at one of the cameras. But wed only see it for a few seconds before it disappeared.

It was focused on me though. Id spot it the most, and Id see it outside of the house. It was definitely the same thing though. It had a very distinctive shape. It was tall - about 7 feet tall, Id say. Im 62, so it was almost a good foot taller than me. And it was very wiry, almost only a few inches thick on its arms and legs.

It never approached; just watched. Just stood there staring. Id feel the hairs on the back of my neck creep up, and Id spin around to catch its long spindly arm disappearing behind a tree, or a traffic post, or around the corner of a building. Id spot it on the motorway, just standing on the verge, staring, as I sped past. It didnt have any eyes, but I just knew it was staring.

It started to escalate about a month ago now. If I wasnt constantly vigilant, itd start creeping towards me. Not a single crunch of leaves or gravel, even in quiet, echoey rooms, not a single footstep would be heard. It started getting exhausting. 

It was the worst when Id feel it while I was driving. I tried to ignore it - I checked the van already.. There was nothing there. Until I went to look into my left mirror. It was sat there for a split second, staring.. But this time, it had these.. empty, white eyes. I panicked, My van slid around the road and I pulled up on the side of the road and scrambled out. It was lucky I was on a mostly empty road. I stood across the road from the van and stared, my heart pounding and my breath fast and sharp. 

This was getting ridiculous now - but I had no idea on what I could do. Maybe it was the medication? A few of us in the family were on similar medications. I decided to stop taking them and talk to the doctor about the hallucinations.

Its been about a week now since I said Id go to the doctor, and Ive not had the chance to go. Ive not taken the pills, but Im still seeing it. Im getting exhausted from the constant vigilance, but I dont want to find out what will happen if I let it catch me. Im holed up in a hotel at the moment, working long distance. Im not expected back until Friday, and this hotel is a signal deadspot, no mobile signal, so if something happens - no-one can contact me.. or try to contact me anyway.

Maybe its trying to keep me awake, its hard to drive when youre tired. Theres only so much that coffee can do. Ive not seen it today, though. Maybe I lost it driving down here? 
 




 Money for kickstarter projects doesn't get taken until the funding date has ended. So in this case, no money was taken at all because the creator cancelled before the due date. It's a much needed safety precaution. 

If the funding wasn't hit by the due date, money wouldn't get taken (Unless it was flexi funding, which this wasn't - Always keep your eye out for that.) 




 Update: the funding has been cancelled. Looks like the creator had a flick through the comments here and realised they hadn't thought it through.. :( 




 The software they're using is a package software which looks like it allows them to use assets on a premade "app" so to speak. I've raised a few of the issues with them still 




 Hey guys, not sure if you've heard about this yet. 

There's a kickstarter underway to make an Asexual dating app, much like Tinder or Grinder. I'm not affilated with it at all, but I'm hoping it can get funded! 

I'm very much sick of flicking through both Tinder and Grindr to try and find something, and all I can find is people after casual hookups or are very much searching by appearance.

The creator's answered a few questions about the effort, and it seems like it's pretty legit, chucking a dollar or two at it shouldn't be too bad. :3

Link is here!

 Took 3 hours, done in one sitting.

Had quite a crap few months. Elastic Heart by Sia helped me realised I had depression and pushed me to get the Diagnosis. Felt it only right to get a homage. It also looks badass. 









 ..And I don't get paid until Thursday. There's only so far Noodles are going to get me.

I would be super appreciative if one of you kind folk would sub me a pizza - I will get you a pizza right back on Thursday! 

If it helps any, I'm in the UK 




 Niiice. I love me a bit of 'tallica. Static-X and Rammstein was pretty much my entire teenage years. Gutted about Wayne!

Watched Rammstein..  last year? at Download Festival. Damn crazy show. 




 Oh man, Black Dahlia Murder - Only head of them when I was at Download Festival in 2008. Jumped into a pit and promptly got knocked over, fell on my face and broke my nose. Fun times. 




 Woo!

At the moment, I'm in an "Upon a Burning Body" mood, which is where I got the inspiration to get the commission for! But my all-time favourite band is In Flames 









 I went there yesterday. Jesus Christ, couldn't move for people standing in the way, or taking selfies.  




 http://taernfastgrade.tumblr.com

Absolute nonsense but mostly funny reblogs with a little bit of furry in there. 




 I'm on the staff for one of the bigger UK pony cons, and some of the stereotypes of bronies can be completely true. It's the most vocal, noticeable members of fandoms that almost set the tone for the entire fandom. Not to say that they're completely annoying - some of my closest friends I met through the brony fandom, and while I'm now anything _but_ a brony, I still keep in frequent contact with them, and I'm trying to put time aside for watching the show.

In terms of them being almost the same, I can see your point, but while the pony fandom has a canon thing to base their fandom and discuss and whatever else, the furry fandom doesn't really have so much of a base other than themselves. Yeah, there are films and shows like.. half the disney catalogue, but furs are a completely separate entity. In terms of how the fandom feels, yeah, they're lmost the same, I guess. I find the furry fandom tends to have an older average. I attended BUCK 2012, and I worked it in 2013 and will be working it this year, and I'd pin the average age for bronies (in the UK at least) about 17-18, making me (24) feel a tad old.

On the other hand, Furries in the UK tend to be older. I was at Confuzzled this year, and there was times I felt like one of the younger attendees. With an older average, the behaviour tends to shift more towards mature... Alcohol related stuff.

It's just unfortunate that the pony fandom has this huge stigma around it now because of the surge of what I like to call "Former Sonic Fandom Members" - the open RP on public pages, terrible english/grammar, and over the top fandom-evangelicalism. ("This video is 20% cooler!")

.. Wow, I kind of went on a bit there.

Quick edit: [I had a kind of similar ish blog post last year-ish.](http://www.accordingtotaern.com/2013/10/a-breakdown-of-fandoms.html)  




 Aah nards. In that case then, if you're searching display name, it's just Taern and you should see my fursona in there somewhere. He's a grey lynx with back hair \ blue ear tufts 




 Add me on steam! I've got about 200-odd games so chances are we'll have one or two in common. I'm EU based so timezones might be wacky. 

I'm "zeifer" on steam.  




 Cosmic's suit is so soft and huggy! Was at CFz, it was amazing! 




 Go ahead and add me if you like. I'm Taern Fastgrade on G+ :3 




 Me too. I was gearing up for an eye-rolling night, but the only time I wanted to punch him was when he started going off on one about airports. 




 Mine also ends in BJ. 9BJ.

All 9 of them. 




 Brugge is fantastic. I went in January in 2007 and there was barely anyone around, I walked around all the buildings, the parks, the towers and bought some excellent chocolate from a tiny gift shop down some really tiny side street 




 Not been in for a year or two myself, but yeah. It's pirate themed and got a little monorail inside. Not sure if it's laser gun themed because every time I've gone, it's always been off!

I think I'm too big ^tee^hee for the ride anyway, I'm like 6"2 and pushing 300lbs and I imagine it's a bit tiny and aimed at kids anyway. 




 Aaah, Blackpool. Many a childhood memory there. Coral Island took all my money as a teenager. I love arcades! 




 I'm not sure that would be wise. I know for a fact I'd be attached to a wall mumbling something about keyboards.. 




 Once I left the Retail job, My tax righted itself and I was only paying around 50 tax/NI. 




 It was coming out of my new Full Time job, which I got a few months after starting the weekend part time at retail.

Was getting around 800 a month from my Full time place, which the 200 tax came out of, and 220 from retail which wasn't taxt. In the end I was essentially working weekends to pay off the 200/mo tax

I worded it badly, I'll admit that one. o.o' 




 The Retail job was my "first", technically.

 I moved to what is now my current job which became my second. the 20% applied to this, which was where the 200 was coming from. Rather than fuck around with the tax office to get codes swapped, I just left my retail job and got the issue corrected. 

Got my weekends back and had a good wage until I got myself in debt like a tit. 




 I was doing 8 hours a weekend in my old Retail gig, coming out with about 220 a month from there.

200 was taken out in tax. I was losing money just working there with transport costs 




 Not exactly the most imaginative, but it goes so well when I'm tanking and I'm playing FFXIII music!

Working out outfits for my MNK/SMN

 




 Hi Guys, apologies if it's already been answered elsewhere, but I did search and found nothing.

I've come upon hard times lately and trying to work off a ton of high interest debt. I'm just about getting by with my current wage but it's by the skin of my teeth.

Pay rise at my current job is out of the question, so I've been thinking about a weekend part-time job just to pad out the earnings a little bit and get a change of scenery from the office

I've scoured the HMRC site but it's all vague and personal allowance stuff, which I'm already over with my current job salary.

Last time I had a second job, I was 17 doing part time, and with the tax code I had I was paying upwards of 200 on my second job, making it completely pointless with the hours I was capable of

Just wondering, what is the usual situation for a second job's Tax Code? I think last time I may have been on an Emergency Tax Code 




 I use CJS keys, but I think they're a UK company. It's all online, so it shouldn't matter, but all prices are in !

**Quick note, what I've linked is an _EU_ time card. Careful!** 




 Similar mechanic on WoW - Disengage for hunters.

Mid Lich King Heroic attempt, decided to disengage out of a puddle of bad.

Went flying off the edge like a lunatic. Cackled all the way to my death. 




 Reading the shenanigans at the reception, I had the Benny Hill theme playing in my head. It just fit so well. 




 We're still recruiting to get enough people to get a group of 8 actives in the FC, so we're just getting stuff like Ultima and Titan HM on "farm" to get our FC working well together! We want to get to coil soon and I think we're getting there. 




 "Cheers pal"

If everyone in front of you has already used all the variations of thanks, it feels weird, and I always feel shite if I forget to thank him. 




 Hah, will do. Pretty set in Cerberus though. Playing with a pretty tight-knit FC and some rad contacts in my linkshells! 




 Nope. I went the whole hog after trying everything I could find on the internet for the last 3 hours.

Internet Options, clearing files, attempted reinstalls, .rar files of game folders before losing my temper with W8 in general and reinstalling 7. Then I found this thread. 




 God damn, there I was cursing out W8 for ruining everything. Lost my temper and put W7 back on hoping it'd feex.

My connection in general with them has been pretty shite of late too.  




 Taern is the secondary character in my story idea. He's a soldier in a rogue squadron after being denied permission to investigate a potential threat to the species. They rob a shit-ton of weapons, armour and shields (Sci-fi!) and go investigate. 

I eventually adopted him as my fursona, but making a few changes to identify between Canon-Taern and Me-Taern 




 Probably. I even type it too much as well. Even when something will definitely happen. "Yeah, probably will."

What can I say, I like an open ended story 




 I think I've seen this before! When you approach it with the prerequisites filled, an event kicks in! 




 On my mind right now?

Debt. Debt. Debt. Currently buzzing around in my mind like particularly vicious wasps stuck in a jar. I'm running around a labyrinth in my mind, trying to find solutions but I keep running into dead ends and pitfalls. Pitfalls filled with even more vicious, angry wasps.

Above the maze, a lone laughing figure, occasionally slamming a huge fist in my path before demanding more money. 

I have a small companion running the maze with me, but clearly not as invested as I am, mostly because I'm keeping him out of it on purpose. He's my only light at the end of the tunnel, and thinking of him keeps me sane in the labyrinth of debt and anxiety.

Sometimes, I'll reach sections of the maze with giant books in the way. I open these and huge ideas fill my head. I want to write them, draw them, live them.. but I'm trapped in the eternal loop of work, sleep, and running the labyrinth 




 I keep meaning to come to the manc meets, but I'm always working. .

Cool suit! 




 I use CJS keys. If they're in stock, you can usually get to your key within 5 mins. Pretty nifty. I'd link but am on my phone. 




 I always saw it as inflating one cheek only. It always looks like a neutral-ish expression, kinda like thinking about something. 




 :T 




 I use CJS Keys. I pay via bitcoin too!

 I was torn from my Button yesterday. The MT from the previous fights was sleepy, so I made the ultimate sacrifice of leaving my button.

I miss my button. Tomorrow, we shall be reunited. 




 Gravy on everything. Including ice cream.

Gravy is good.
 




 I'm in a relationship now with my boyfriend now for 4 months. We've engaged sexually twice.. mostly because of awkwardness with families. 

I'm personally up for it, if just to keep him happy. I'm a complete virgin so I'm extremely inexperienced, but he's been amazing and very understanding about it. 

I can't say I enjoy giving oral.. I've gagged quite a few times but I guess it's all about learning. Heck, even receiving.. It feels odd.

I'd rather just snuggle and watch films..  




 Is it bad that I kind of want to roll a planet? Your description was amazingly disgusting still, but.. did she actually roll or was it kind-of-like a deflated [football](http://leicesterexchanges.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Football.jpg)? 




 It's difficult to be in a relationship with a "sexual" (As much as I hate the term), because your partner wants sex, and in my case, I'm just obliging him to keep him happy.

I don't mind doing this, because in the end, a relationship is about compromise. But that's just me.

You just have to be clear and draw a line with him where you feel comfortable and where you don't. If he doesn't like it, there's no point "hooking up" because it'll only result in more and more friction and it might get ugly. 




 I generally just mark in order of what should really be killed (Barbers in Pharos, Dullahans in AK) then tab then 2, etc.

Makes it a little smother, so I can get a combo off on 1, flash, 2, flash 1, flash, etc. 




 I'm on Tumblr, but I'm not exactly a source of info. Laughs, maybe. Little bit of cynicism and sarcasm dotted around with maybe the occasional Asexual post. 




 Probably get latched onto by the boyfriend for one, then get extremely confused because if I'm in here, then who's being "Me?" 




 Shit yeah we do. Otherwise it's my fault if you pull an enemy off me, and my pocket healer laughs at me. 




 Beat you to it by a few years! But it's a nice reminder. : 




 Was just messing around in Revenants while waiting for LS buddies for Crystal Tower and got my camera like this.  









 Hallo!

Mostly lynx with a bit of an otter side.

 I stream here or there. Usually when I'm fucking around on FFXIV with Free Company buddies. 

[My Stream!](http://twitch.tv/zeiferrei)

With 2.1 hitting, we're playing a lot more, but we usually do end up playing at 8pm on Sundays more often than not. 




 "Shit me, I'm on Mars." 




 This just in, Bear found shitting in woods 




 How to run further and faster

1. Warm up: Watch your ankles, the Benny will stay 1 step behind you at all times.

2. Another dog? New friend!

3. How to hill climb: Just follow the dog. 




 Hybrids are fun to work with! It's all about trying to merge to animals together in all sorts of different ways to see what looks good. 

Folfs are quite common as well as Dragon/Anything

But you could always combine the different kinds of cats. Lynx/Jaguar? Tiger/Lion?

I've gone Lynx/Otter for mine because why not? 




 You get the occasional crazy, aye. But most know their boundaries and will back off when asked.

If not.. well, that's what people like me are about for. Find a staff member and they'll find security, and we'll give 'em a proper telling off or kick 'em out if they're repeat offenders.

But don't let the stories scare you (if they are!) Cons are a blast and I've met many great people from them. 




 Me and a few buddies play Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn. 
We're hyped as shit for 2.1 when we get home.

We mostly UK with a few drop ins from Scandanavia. We're more of a gaming community in ourselves. Most play LoL, while the rest of us play FFXIV. We'll drop in and out and play other games too.
 




 Aye. Twas BUCK.

Pants man was this incredibly crazy fellow running around with a pair of boxer shorts on his head, thrusting at anyone and anything. He even got a group and stood outside the convention venue and thrusted at passing trams.

I had to make sure anyone he was thusting at wasn't feeling uncomfortable, and watching that lunatic as well as vendor tables was a headache. :P 




 Might possibly be working this year. \^^

It'll be my first, but from my past Con attendance, UK cons seem to be pretty chill in terms of attendees. I worked at the UK's biggest Brony con doing security and aside from a few creeps, everyone was rather well behaved!

I'd say depending on where you live it might be worth staying at the Venue. If you live only 20-30 miles out, it might be worth just buying petrol money/public transport. But if you're like me and 90-100 miles out, on site accom or nearby accom is best bet.

But in all, Conventions are made by person interaction. Half of the conventions I've been to wouldn't have been as funny if it wasn't for the attendee interaction. 

Oh Pants Man, you were amazing, but such a security annoyance. 




 About a year and a half now.. I'm 23. 




 I asked a few weeks back as well. Got a canned "Not accepting at this time but isn't ruled out" response.

(Ooh, actually. Quick edit: Takeaway.com have some places in the UK and they accept bitcoin!) 




     such coine
                          wow

 Left the house for a coffee and to walk the dog. Nearly got bowled over and damn near dropped my coffee. Dog shit himself when I nearly fell on him

Also, lost my favourite hat. Whizzed off my head, rolled down a hill and landed in t' river. 




 Love this song. As someone in a relationship with another male, this one really hits home.  




 On the submission, they say that the final thing is full colour. The sketches are just an example of the poses. 




 If it's heavy, I usually love it.

Prog, Melodic, Heavy.

In Flames, All The Remains, Devildriver, Rhapsody of Fire are my favourites, but I love all kinds of metal 




 I got the same. I found it actually quite accurate. I might actually have to pick up To Kill a Mockingbird. 




 Used to play quite hardcore, but dropped it after burning out something awful.

I might pop back for Warlords of Draenor and see where I go after that 




 Very much so. I find when I'm doing some tome grinding I can only do 3 or 4 in a row before needing an extended break. Luckily I usually run with FC/LS buddies so they can usually be quite happy to wait for a few while I take a few to catch up on reddit or something

I'm getting used to tanking, so I'm getting better at not fucking up too often. Have my occasional brainfarts, but who doesn't?

I saw that someone said they run with the focus of not messing up - I'm exactly the same. It really drains you, even when you mark and cane the emnity. You want to position everything right so that the MNK/DGN doesn't have to move much.

I'm an overperformer when I really don't need to be. I hate to inconvenience the rest of the party and it kills me. 




 Well, you know. We like to hold hands and be interested in people of.. _The same sex_

We're totally deplorable and I'm surprised we've gotten away with it so far 




 I run in screaming.

Run in spamming my key for Shield Lob until it goes off. As I'm positioning the boss, I'll throw in Circle of Scorn, turn around, start off with Fast Blade, then throw in a Spirits Within, then Savage Blade  Rage of Halone

then just FB  SB  RoH, throwing in Spirits Within and Circle of Scorn when available or save them for upcoming mobs or save the high damage things for Bloodbath combined with Fight or Flight 




 Not much development has gone into weapons yet, but I've got a "gun" that targets an electrical appliance and turns it off. Usually used by "dark" squads to kill lights as they move around starships

I'm more or less focusing on society, mannerisms, and clothing styles right now. 




 Still on my PS3 at the moment, but feel free to add me if you like.. Is it cross-platform for PSN friends? I forgot.

Add me! 

**train_subject8542** 




 Same here. Oddly enough, Google Services on highest battery usage, followed by AlarmDroid, weirdly enough.

Only at 73% battery though, though I leave mine on charge overnight. Been at work now for 7 hours.

My usage today stands at 27% Services, 26% AlarmDroid

Unless Play music streaming counts as Services now, it's a little odd. 




 Meteor is always hilarious. We didn't have any melee DD for a pre-made titan group, but we were getting the heart down every time, so there was no worries

We were saving the LB3 for healers should shit have gone down, but we were gong flawless, so a BLM used LB3.

all I could hear on mumble was "I CAN'T SEE!" and the guy's HP bar suddenly drop to Zero. Turns out he got hit by Landslide.

It was some miracle I could actually stay upright to finish tanking him. That was our kill too! 




 That was an interesting afternoon. I was like "That's that Charlie fella from busted, oh this is going to be pure cringe."

And then they actually were quite good. 




 We're stuck in the early 90s.

Please help us. 




 Your profile is confusing me. You're in Paladin gear but the picture shows not-paladin gear. 




 I've found when I'm tanking anything or running around in FATEs or whatever.. I'll run out of the AoE and jump. 

I've not been hit by an AoE in a while unless I've been _really_ derp and either not noticed the cast bar (AK End boss, I'm looking at you) or I've just horribly mistimed running away. 




 I'm in IT Training, hoping to get into IT support soon.

the whole talking with other people aspect of it is kind of draining on me, being an introvert and all that, so at the end of the day, I'm really drained and absolutely _need_ to be left alone.

But aside from documenting what goes on in the calls, it's great for me because there's no other organisation to do really. I can just have piles of paperwork of things to teach or show around me, with no need for anyone else to look at my stuff.

I'm quite outgoing when I am on the calls (or at least I try to be) but I definitely need my downtime between calls or at home otherwise I burn out and get cranky and nasty with colleagues or family. 




 I'm a little bit of a cynic, I've been burned a few times in the past when I was a little more trusting, so I've slowly evolved into a bit of a cynical bastard. 




 I totally forgot about it. I used it back in 1.0 with the limited amount of time I played.

[Shameless link because I can](http://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/character/2284483/blog/436904/) 




 I don't hide it, but I don't flaunt it.

Well. Maybe a little. Profile pictures are of him, but I'm not labelling myself furry on profile bios or anything. Heck, on Facebook (Old school friends, family, etc) I even got a few likes when the "Changed his profile picture" went up. 




 Aggressive stuff. Heavy/Hard Rock, Metal, "Bro"step (Knife Party, Some Skrillex)

Favourite bands at the minute are [In Flames](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewFgQqklqHM), [Royal Republic](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xN2hL8NvrMw), [Knife Party](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipX6wgwuHho), [Pendulum](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogMNV33AhCY), [Korn](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hetDSqvMT4 feature=youtube_gdata_player)

But I pretty much like anything - [Ah Nee Mah](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uqFJ0daX6s), some BGM Music for towns in FF games like [Cosmo Canyon](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvpL1bfc6YI) or [The Great Warrior](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4bEPxULwME) are my favourites for chilling out to.
 




 Excellent. Just in time for payday too! 




 Huh, when did that change? I drove past a Sainsbury's on my way home and it was 1.29.  




 Extremely unpopular - everyone would kick off if it shoots up again.

I know I've got it good on my tax (20/yr) but 1.30/L up norf still makes my wallet shiver. 




 Bit rainy, like. Nothin' we can't handle. they've been yammerin' on like it's the end of the world or summat.

Weather was worse on Friday, like. See that funderstorm? Bloody hell, not seen one like that fer a bit. 




 I'm totally the opposite. There's barely anything there.

I'm in a relationship now and still - nothing.
Although I am Asexual, so that probably explains it. 




 Eesh. Typo'd in the title. Meant to say Grumpy butt. It's what I call him when he starts groaning at me for patting his paws while he tries to sleep.

He's 13 now. Old git! 









 That road looks so familiar. It's actually going to keep me awake while I think of where it is. 




 I'm on Cerberus as well. I'm Paladin, I have a WHM/SCH friend and a Bard friend. If we're doing nothing we're always up for anything short of Coil! Our FC isn't exactly active though - we're like freelancers. 




 Aye, that you can. M/23/British here as well and somewhat sexually active. My body doesn't seem to do much more other than snuggling and stuff after a weekend with someone close last week.

There's groups of Asexuals (I've seen them) who are a sex hating bunch, and it's hard to talk them around or even have them see your point of view without getting hostile

Sexual attraction and the act of sex are two totally different things. I've always been Ace, so I can't even describe how Sexual attraction works, but yes, you are still Asexual if you don't feel sexually attracted to someone.

(I've always imagined Sexual attraction being - upon seeing someone, you have a pull to have sex with them, or at least get really close with them physically) 




 "Yes, this is dog. What's that? Your owner obviously didn't throw the toy and he's acting like he did? We can get him for distress for that. Here's my direct number and address." 




 I came out to my parents a few days ago, though mum's totally confused. Admittedly, I came out as Biromantic at the same time, but she's confused at that too. 




 Exactly. 

I had a bit of an experience this weekend where I found out I'm definitely Ace, I can understand why sex is "valued" by people, but I frankly found it boring and was quite happy to just have the snuggles and the cuddles, etc. 




 Done by klippy, she did such a fantastic job on it I just can't even anymore.

Character on the left is Shia'le, on the right is my main 'sona Taern. 









 [](/cadanceheart)I pick up on smells and scents a lot. I've got a pretty close person in my life right now and lots of smells trigger memories of them. It's amazing and it helps me feel a lot better

Old smells, like Nan's cooking will sometimes come to be out of nowhere. Kind of like a scent memory bank. I get looked at funny when I say "What the hell, I can smell [thing]!" when we're in a concert or in the car or somewhere where I won't typically smell the thing 




 Tell me about it, Luckily I was tanking and my FC buddy who came with me was healing, so they had to be a little patient, the other tank was having fun with trash with the other healer

Still felt mad pressured to skip cutscenes though, buddy kept shouting at me to watch the cutscenes over mumble 




 The beautiful thing about a newly released MMO is that boss tactics aren't widely known in game, and no-one "expects" you to know the dungeons

I tanked Cutter's Cry a while ago, and Chimera was definitely interesting, After a 2nd wipe I was wondering why the healer and the caster dps were getting hit - was I missing adds or was there some damage I couldn't keep hold of?

turn out I didn't notice Dragon's Voice hitting distant players. After we got the dance down, we caned him.

I love running blind in dungeons - I tried to do it in WoW but I was a late starter and everyone expected you to know what to.

Heck, I ran Ampador Keep blind last night with two FC buddies and while I was freaking out at trash mobs (I'm a paladin and there was a Bard and a BLM in the party, AoE Party!) It was super fun, Demon Wall took some doing and working out when and what happened. 




 the worst part about trying to come across as sex positive as an Asexual is that people, upon finding out you're sex positive then say

 "Well then, you're not Asexual" 

as if to say the "Involuntary Celibacy" is the whole point of being Asexual. 




 Sitting here at 11pm, wearing my hoodie and nursing a hot choc..

Beats the crap of swearing at the fan for not being cold enough and tossing and turning all night, getting some heat-induced insomnia. 




     wow 
                       such effects

        such reaping

                          wow


      must save galaxy 









 I've got the craziest head. I've got plenty of stories in my head I'm trying to write, if I can somehow get the time.

I love writing as well, I write on a rant blog for myself to let off some steam. I can sit and write for hours with minimal fuss.
