 The "Molly Ringwald" syndrome 




 Was expecting cheesy generic space comedy-ended up with a trojan horse of darkness and feels. 




 Ah, you run on now young blood 




 Surely starvation and homelessness isn't due to lack of motivation? I agree each rung in the ladder should have an incremental increase in quality of life but why can't a thriving metropolis be at minimum built on a strong social foundation of responsibility instead of the bodies of those left behind? 









 I get it. Buy up all you can, pushing the price up of what you already have and then dump it before "Bubbles" the invisible elephant in the room comes in and ruins everything. If this hurts low income earners then they should have studied harder or made better decisions in life. I had a work colleague tell me "being homeless is a choice for most of these people". Much like not attending/coping at work because of depression is a "choice". Mental illness is just an excuse lazy people use to drain decent hard working people of their income. #amirite? Besides it's survival of the fittest. 




 The story was good but I just felt the BS2 was a more 'arcadey' stunted version of BS1. Less dread and more action. Like going from Hellraiser to Diehard 




 Number 1 was creepier and felt like it had more atmosphere. Number 2 looked like a console port that was cobbled together in a rush. It's like a fan made version of number 1.  




 I loved the first game and hated the second. Which one is the book closest to? 




 Let the homeless sleep in investment properties that go for months unoccupied.  









 I don't know how I can deconstruct that 









 I bet that guy really does know where to get cocaine.

 Sorry. If anything I was hoping this could ignite some interest to make it happen 




 Just a "wish" screenshot I made. Can you imagine how cool it would be? 




 Yes indeedy :D 
























 I consider it a set of rules to protect people from themselves. This is separate from Authoritarian rule.

 This would make a great watercolor 




 I just love the inner voice "The... FUCK?"

 On the way to being the image of who I want to be (realistically speaking) 




 Thanks. If I can do it, anyone can. 




 Thank you! 




 Thank you :) Just started eating my big meals at the start of the day instead of the end. Cut down on junk food and exercise at the end of every day leg squats and pushups 




 Thanks! 




 I am happy with it, it just took me by surprise. I didn't realize it would change me so much 









 I only know this from watching The Castle 




 ICACn't just as in ASICn't. 




 I was told and keep being told piracy will kill the industry.  




 If we legalized drugs, we could employ the dealers. Saves on training and removes a large swathe of the illegal workforce. 




 Did he fondle sweaters? 




 Honour the dead, not the celebration of it. 




 Sounds Rad 




 No flashy bullshit, just Les doing what he does. A+ 




 I was hoping you were going to end the sentence with Waking Life. 




 Ozploitation movies are the tits 




 Poor cat :( 




 If you could make money by fostering/incubating a social problem and in parallel selling it's solution under a different guise-you'd effectively create a self sustaining business. 









 I worded it wrong. I'll resubmit :p 




 Better than red wine and hair pieces  




  I personally don't have a weight issue I was more or less just interested if it would work. 

I wasn't concerned with sustainability - just if it would work at all 









 Did you say dick cream? 




 This is the shiznit. Love your style 




 Am downloading Dishonored now 




 It almost felt like an indie homage to the original bioshock 




 It's in my steam wishlist :) 




 The first 1 is great. Nice horror feel to it. The second one feels rushed/done for the fps market/made on a shoestring budget. The story was good but that's all. 




 I'm relieved this is top comment 




 I wonder what Snoop and Morgan would make of it? Would they dig it or get all litigious 




 I never knew anyone who admitted to liking them 




 Holy shit I can't remember the last time I heard someone mention Tumbleweed 




 From what I hear Napoleon didn't exactly speak like the angels 




 Apparently Napoleon had a pretty shit french accent anyway. That's why Pesci is perfect 














 Surely Morgan's team could sue for $ given his likeness would be used? 




 He'd have to be 




 Don't know if I did it right but I tagged you as SoothSaiyan  




 Thanks bud! I'm happy to throw out a few more if people are interested.

One of the biggest smiles I got was from a redditor who framed one of my pics for her bf. Shucks :D
