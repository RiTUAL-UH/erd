 And SJW sounds like a  good thing to be too.  Social Justice....  yeah, that's an evil thing to want.   Who would want that?     




 This is still a bug that has not been fixed.   It is a problem that has to be effecting a large number of users who assume when they see the forbidden message that the problem is that Reddit doesn't want them submitting, period.  So they give up and go do something else.  I know how to work around it, but it is annoying as heck.  

Please look into fixing it.  




 This is still a problem.    I've explained in other comments in this thread exactly what causes the problem and how it could be easily fixed.   

This is really annoying.  And while I know how to get around it, I'll bet it is effecting many users who just think Reddit is them that they are not allowed to submit, period.  

Please look into fixing it.    Thank you.  






















































 /r/Coontown alone already is almost as large as Stormfront on it's own.   Include all the Chimpire and other associated subreddits, and they are much larger than Stormfront right now.

 There were many fully secular people involved in the Civil Rights movement as well.  It was not a religious movement.   A good number of religious people were involved,  but the movement itself was not religious in nature.    








































































































 Vegetarians are very evil.    As a /r/Food and /r/Health mod have seen amazing evidence that proves that they only consume Soylent Green.    And, as we all know, [Soylent Green is people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IKVj4l5GU4).  









 There are people in that thread splitting hairs so fine that several of them would claim Obama isn't even Obama because Robot Space Lizards don't have Earth names.

 As a mod of /r/Apple I can tell you with absolute certainly that Tim Cook only cooks meat-based products.  He is from Alabama after all.  :-)

 Of course it's the National Review.   They won't bother to research what Ted Cruz, Jed Bush or Rick Perry pays their staff though.  That's for sure.  




 A very long time.  I was the one who implemented that back in the day.   /r/History does it for six or eight hours.  




 Does Sanders pay his staff interns, or are they paid for out of the Senate's own internal Operations budget?    If the later, then Sanders has one vote out of 100 when it comes to what staff interns are paid.   

If it's from a budget he controls, then he would get a to determine how it's spent.  In such a case, I would guess it would be something he farmed out to a Chief of Staff or something, which hopefully Sanders will be correcting the situation shortly.

 You're mistake is admitting those things.   True Jewish Zionists always deny it.  Always.     




 That certainly explains what Nixon was.

 And AATA is so interested in how the guy found the thread.   Well, that's easy using Reddit search.  Find out where AATA is mentioned by anyone who is not AATA with [this search of reddit](https://www.reddit.com/search?q=AssuredlyAThrowAway+-author%3AAssuredlyAThrowAway+-reddit%3Asubredditreports restrict_sr= sort=new t=all).    

And that's without the added power of looking directly at AATA user overview or using Google.

 It's all becoming clear now.   Obviously a guy who was in *Head of the Class* was turned evil by Howard Hesseman.  Diabolical!  Johnny Fever was prime evil!   




 Elos, your comment here is mostly gloating.  Yeah, you got him.   I removed him now too.   But come on, just send us a mod mail in the future instead please.   We can deal with it neatly then. 

Thank you.  




 Well, this thread got me to remember [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6MOnehCOUw). 




 Yeah..... Well, you can use facts to prove anything which is even remotely true.   




 Does it matter?   




 It's the summer time.   A lot of people when asked by pollsters say "Sure [hahaha], I'd vote for Trump.   Pass me another beer".   When it actually comes time to really vote, even in a simple primary or caucus, people sober up real quick.   




 Making it through his POW experience was a bit more than just a passive thing though.   I'm a left wing liberal, I disagree with McCain on a lot of policy stuff.   But more than 99% of people would just give up and just die instead of allowing themselves to be treated the way the North Vietnamese treated McCain and many of his fellow prisoners.   Survival wasn't a passive thing on his part, nor was it simple.   




 McCain lost his teeth to a ball-peen hammer.  He has a personal relationship with torture that other people just don't have.   




 More of an 6.7 in my opinion.    




 I removed  the thread about this guy from /r/Bestof yesterday.  It was reported over 90 times.    Which is a lot of reports.   Most heavily reported threads never get more than 5 or 6 reports.  Sometimes a rare one makes it to 10 or 12.   But I saw 90 reports and removed it.    

And now it gets even worse.   

This guys problems are really turned up to 11.   










































































 /r/conspiracy, you just [never change](http://i.imgur.com/Ta3AY.jpg).  









 You are going to actually assert that thread is real?   It's a text-file created on free text file hosting service (similar to imgur is for image-files) is posted to /r/conspiracy by a mod of /r/conspiracy.   It's obviously fake and was created from whole cloth by the same account that posted it.    

You can't figure this one out on your own?   I really have to explain it to you?    




 /r/Bestof allows any subreddit to opt-out per mod request.    

They can have a permanent opt-out forever.   Automod will enforce that.   

Or they can request removals piecemeal on a per-submission basis.   

/r/Bestof always respects a mod teams rights to not be highlighted at /r/Bestof.  

Likewise, we don't allow the subreddit to be used for witch hunts or in efforts to get somebody down voted.   If a submission to /r/Bestof is highlighting a comment people would normally want to down vote, we'll remove it.   /r/Bestof is meant to be a positive experience and the /r/Bestof mod-team won't allow it to be used as an attack platform.  

We work with other teams and the admins to keep the *Best of* experience positive for everyone.    




 I didn't create anything.   I stepped up to defend some people who I thought were doing the right thing.    There is a difference.   




 I remember LouF.   

I also remember /u/zephir (now zephir_baned_baned and zephir_banned_baned).   He used to show up in /r/science and /r/Physics and complain that Albert Einstein time traveled into his home, stole his work and physically assaulted him and a bunch of other butty stuff.     I think he is a [time-cube](http://www.timecube.com/) crazy.   I never really could figure out what he was trying to say cause it hurt my brain to read his comments.  

Anyway, the mods of /r/Science and elsewhere have been repeatedly banning him for years.  

He seemed to have made for this [Billy Madison scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQCU36pkH7c) to come to life.  




 Don't forget the guys at /r/conspiracy, who have more than 300K subscribers.  They [never brigade anything](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3dtg7h/israel_affiliated_mod_utrain_subject8652_shows_up_in/).   




 The admins have directly said alts would count in the max-number of defaults one can mod.  So, /u/karmanaut and /u/bechus both count in the total number of defaults Karmanaut can mod.   If you have information about anyone modding more than four default subreddits, you should alert the [Reddit admins](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Freddit.com) about it.   




 R_A posted [this image](http://i.imgur.com/J2Ks9uw.png) in [this comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/3dt2ix/drama_in_rdocumentaries_after_mod_nukes_nearly/ct8fknb).   Of course the guys from /r/conspiracy will now explain to us how none of that is antisemitic in the slightest.  

I'm sure they will explain to us how they aren't a brigade either.   As we all know that bipolarbear0 made them do it.    




 Sorry about that then.   Please forgive me.    There are a few weirdos who follow me around with different accounts at times.   




 I didn't even remove the thread I supposedly removed.   Of course, it was all me.   Yeah, right.  Whatever.
