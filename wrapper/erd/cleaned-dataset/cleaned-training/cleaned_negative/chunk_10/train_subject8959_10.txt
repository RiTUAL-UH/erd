 The inability to comprehend someone disagreeing is precisely why I can't... no, I won't support it. 




 Well, you certainly helped my case lol 









 KFC refusing to reform after videos leaked of chickens being tortured. Paul McCartney got involved, PR nightmare. I haven't visited a KFC in a decade as a result and I'm now vegetarian largely because of what the scenario taught me about corporate restaurants. 




 You picked pouting over a sarcastic comment over reasonable response. To each their own. 




 Yeah that's nuts. I know the alphabet, basic words and a few sentences and I'm learning numbers now. It's a major major part of the woman I love, I feel it's important to show her I understand that. 




 Get an English teaching degree. Move to OPs home town. Find his or her school. Befriend the English teacher. Get them to fall in love with me. Send them abroad and take over teaching the class myself. Teach proper tenses of the word "launch" every single day of class. 




 Bulgaria, similar language to Russia in structure and sound to me but she swears they are vastly different. 




 I married someone from Eastern Europe. She didn't give me a choice. 




 Traveling from DC to Norfolk some years ago, I sat next to a man who was absolutely brilliant. Physics professor I believe.  We discussed chess, fantastic theories etc. Was really cool. He was attending his sons wedding, I was there for work.

A strike at my company caused me to have to reschedule my return flight, early by 3 days. When I boarded the plane, I was seated next to the same man. His son had broken his arm and they delayed the wedding and he scheduled an early flight home. 




 Supporting feminism 









 Good call edited to address that 




 Again, I do not support him. I'm pointing out real possible damage he could represent to Democrat opposition. Personally, I feel Republicans are up shits creek in this election and they know it. I would say, short of some catastrophic attack against US that allows GOP to ride the "Obama failed us" train into the White House, they stood no chance before Trump and now they stand even less of a chance of winning. 




 Edit: To address question, you have access to the fictional universe of your target.

 Honestly? He's so under the radar he's difficult to criticize by personality while also being a minority. This blunts a great deal of criticism towards Trump as being racist, it practically negates a major attacking point of the Democratic nominee. Also he is an incredibly intelligent man. I don't agree with most of what he says but I can certainly acknowledge he is very smart. 









 I'm so glad you shared that with me, but I didn't ask for your opinions on the state of the Union. I asked a specific question to a specific group of people. As a Democrat, let me tell you your immediate jump to insulting others before hearing them out is a hypocritical display of intolerance of intolerance and makes us all look bad. 




 This in no way addresses the question I asked.  









 I would be incredibly interested to see potential running mates. Ben Carson or Condoleeza Rice could genuinely clench it for him which is hard to imagine as reality to me. 




 This is amazing, I never thought of that. 



















 What is the best advice you have for training or studying? 




 Has any serious discussion taken place to study the use of hallucinogens in resolving OCD? If so, who is leading this discussion? If not, do you believe it's something that may happen?

 I'm jealous of this submission. That is all.

 "Bullying" is subjective. If I believe these  policies are bullying towards me, does a black hole open up and devour the solar system? 




 You said 3 twice. 3 + 3 = 6. You have 60 characters not including spaces in that sentence. 60+6 = 66. My name is train_subject8959. 66 + 666 = 9/11 Towers 




 I'm sorry, I don't understand you. I don't own a fedora. 









 Thanks for the input, everyone. I appreciate those that shared some valuable information it's incredibly helpful. 




 This is very helpful, thank you! 









 NOT a grow/dispensary job. Looking for any advice in general for the process of starting a business in the state. I'm a resident and have been working on my business plan but I do not quite understand the licensing for the business and would love any input I could get. Thanks. (Also I apologize if this is not an appropriate post, it seems the most logical place to ask, that's all. Thanks !) 




 How did it happen? What was the long term and short term impacts to your company? What if anything did your company do to address the problem(s)? 




 "Freedom of Speech does not mean we support everything people want to say. They have the freedom to say words. Not any words, it doesn't say freedom of all speech does it?"
-The answer I predict we're going to hear 









 If they're not practicing any illegal trades, I don't think any subs should be "deserving" of a ban. That's exactly how it starts, convincing people that unpopular people or ideas needed to be eliminated. Then you start moving people towards viewing your beliefs as popular and all others as "dark". The rest is elementary. 









 Supporting censorship is funny. Yay for shutting down things I don't agree with.  




 You're right. It's not funny. A woman is practically dead. However, the silver lining is that I just saved a shitload on my car insurance. 




 I didn't imply that at all. I stated "If America was truly a Christian nation". You, in a clear mistake on your part, blurted out "BUT WE GREATEST WAT IF WE NO HEAR!?" That's almost funny if it were not so sad. 
























 21 year olds are considered old in BMT. Many reach sergeant before they can legally consume alcohol in the US.

 Any idea how they expect this to happen? Pretty sure that would be impossible by sheer population advantage.

 Brevity, for Christs sake. You know who preaches? Preachers. And in my experience, preachers tend to be wrong. 









 Absolutely not. 




 Trump is attacking the threat. Why waste time or effort acknowledging all the players "beneath" him? Strategically, he's doing what any candidate that wants to win would do. Hit the strongest opponent as soon as you can, as hard as you can and don't stop hitting them until one of you stop moving. 




 I want him to be. At this point one of two things will happen. He'll continue gaining popularity in the party and win the nomination in a surprise victory OR the GOP will ostracize him which he won't forgive and we get an independent Trump in the general, bleeding conservative votes and sinking whichever idiot wins the Republican primary. Either way, invest in popcorn now because that stock is about to skyrocket. 



















 City street fight 




 I cannot imagine any scenario where the APA/war machine collusion was limited to only this. My gut tells me this is a speck on the tip of the iceberg. 



















 Thank you. Completely and sincerely. Thank you. 









 Weird, he was seriously being considered for guardians of the galaxy too... 




 That's fine, but I'm interested in whether or not anyone had demonstrated vulnerabilities yet. Seems like people would be tripping over one another to reveal flaws in either OS.

EDIT: I distrust practically any and all tech in the US right now for the record but I do believe money is more important to them than US interests at this point. I definitely don't trust them but I also can't set either company sacrificing global market share to satisfy American intelligence agencies.

 Interesting take on it. Has it or Android 5.1.1 been demonstrated to not be secure? Serious question, I'm genuinely curious.
