 What AT T is doing, reminds me of Ashley Madison website for cheater where they charge $19 to delete profile :P 














 You are right, have not seen it before...thanks! 









 Only their CEO knows how many fake profiles they have... 




 Look on the bright side...you may get some cool dating requests...obviously joking :)
