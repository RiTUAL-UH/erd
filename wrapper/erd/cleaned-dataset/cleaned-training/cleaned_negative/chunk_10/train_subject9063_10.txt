 Hi there, I'm interested in starting up animation as a small hobby, I was just curious as to what programs would be useful in starting myself off? I'm looking for any program that might have lots of pre-set templates that would be able to help me in studying the basic concepts of animation with an easy pre-cursor to more advanced things.

Sorry if this sounds like a silly request, have no real background on animation programs, the only thing I've really done in the past is stop motion.  









 Was wondering where In this post someone would mention the blatant mis leading title about being left at the altar. Original news post on reddit suggests it was a week before. Not at the altar as this post says. 




 It was only a phone camera, get off my case :( lol 




 Yeah this video didn't capture it very well but local reports from people suggested it did touch down ever so slightly out of sight from where i was.
