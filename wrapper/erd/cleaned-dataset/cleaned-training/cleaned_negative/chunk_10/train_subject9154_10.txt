 Yes there are many names for it. Circle of death is one. I like the idea of the beer tab...brings a bit more excitement into the game. You're drunk...trying not to pop the tab..and BAM..it break and you're chugging. Some of the rules change as well like what each mean. When I only play with 4 people I change 8 to Trivia. bc it's not enough for a "mate"  




 Don't be black.  




 What state?  




 Well this was a dumb question 




 hahahahaha thats so foul 




 Playing style differs depending on region I have found. This is how I play it. 

We put a can of beer in the middle of a table and surround it with a full deck of cards without the two joker cards. 

Each person sits around the table and gets on turn each. You pick up a card and depending on what the card is- is what you follow- each card has a rule or activity that must be performed. When you are done with the card you place it under the beer tab....the person that makes the tab burst must chug the beer....

**Rules** 

1. Aces= Waterfall (Everyone starts drinking/chugging at the same time...but the person to your right cannot stop until you do, and his person to the right cannot stop until he does..and so on...So if you are last...it sucks- To determine which way the you start the waterfall from your left or right I usually ask a common question -Common such as *What beer are we drinking?*- between the person to my left and to my right. The one who gets it right I start in his direction, making the loser..last) 

2. Kings= Rule Master (You can make whatever rule you want...such as "little man" "no Names" and every time you break the rule you must drink) 

3. Queens= Question master (Anytime the question master asks you a question you must answer with a question and so forth until someone doesnt and that person must drink- some people only allow this once others allow it until the next queen is shown) 

4. Jacks= Thumb Master (The person who gets this card puts his thumb on the table and the last one to do it must drink) 

5. Tens- Categories (You choose a category such as "Countries in Africa" The person who fouls up must drink) 

6. Nines= Rhyme Time (You pick a word and go in a circle and you must rhyme...if you don't or you repeat you must drink) 

7. Eights= Pick a mate (Everytime you drink your mate must drink with you) 

8. Sevens= Heaven (You raise your left arm and the last person to do it must drink) 

9. Sixes= Dicks (All males must drink once) 

10. Fives= Social (Everyone takes a drink) 

11. Fours= Whores (All women must drink once) 

12. Threes= For me (You must take 3 drinks) 

13. Twos= For you (You must pass out two drinks)

 Probably not. But you could do 1v1v1v1 then. And for splatfest have a tournament, maybe 1v1 tourney or something.

 It doesn't look like he kicked your ass. It was pretty close till the last few turns. So you play the game online? How do you know if the other person is cheating or not?   




 Privilege is only bad if you can't acknowledge it. If you can't acknowledge it you can't deal with it appropriately.  




 You are either high out of your mind or trolling. Not sure which. I know you can't be serious. I refuse to believe people are that thick headed.  




 Well Eru is God....so I didn't know if that really counted.

 I try to use it to splat as much ink as possible: depending on the map. In Kelp Dome there are certain areas enemies won't touch for 30-40 seconds when I inkstrike it. 

A few seconds of them cleaning up an instrike is worth it because it's more time they arent supporting teammates or pushing. I stay away from snipers, only on Moray Towers do I use it to move a sniper. But mostly I use the Ink Strike on Moray to strike areas around the top of their tower because hardly anyone ever goes down that more than once. People just run away from their home base and hardly ink it, it's always not inked all the way, lot's of black spaces on lots of maps. 

Or if I am near an enemy at Bluefin I will InkStrike the bottom platforms and they will move out of the way towards me so I can kill them because they have no where else to go- either into the inkstrike and die or towards me and die. While this area will be eventually cleaned up I also leave an Ink Mine there so when they do come to clean it they might die to the mine. Or I leave them in blind spots and go somewhere far away from it. Or...lol if I make the mistake of jumping into an enemy i place a mine right away before i die and then they die 




 I never said they were more special. I said having sex in a dumb way and getting someone pregnant is not the same thing as a sperm donor. Because it isn't. They are completely different. 

I never said it makes them their parent either. I said it makes him the kids father...because it does. He is their bio father. The woman...still has the kid, it is her kid- she is giving birth to it even though she is drunk but the guy dips out..but he's just as much responsible for it as she is. So he's nothing more than a coward. A sperm donor is nothing like that. He offers his sperm knowing exactly what is going to happen with it, and signs release forms saying whether or not contact is allowed...etc They are not the same at all. The guy who dipped out is still the bio father- he just dipped out bc he's a coward. 




 Yes exactly thats what I do when I see an inkstrike on turf wars I just shoot into it and it's almost completely gone. So when I ink strike on turf wars, I just make sure to strike somewhere where there isn't any enemy around. Usually around there hjome base making them waste time not advancing.  




 Thank you!! I like to use Inkstrike to take out or momentarily daze a sniper so I can move position while the strike is happening

 Because you're not a sperm donor. You got someone pregnant because you had sex in a dumb way then dipped out and left it to the woman. A sperm donor offers their sperm willingly with the idea that someone who definitely wants kids is going to get them and in return they get money. 

They used the national crime database to track down my father so ...you're wrong there buddy.

 Multiply the amount you put in by how many paychecks you get per year. Use that amount and multiply it by 10 or 15 and that's how much money you would have without  interest. Depends on your savings account, the type, how much interest you get per quarter. 

You can put money in a CD, not sure I'd recommend it right now. 

But If I wer eyou I'd save 50 bucks per paycheck. 5-10 is too little.

 In the front of my door my mom had these house slippers or boat shoes, they were neon with blotches on black all around it, a very 90s type of shoe thing. It was just a slip on. Anyway at night it looked like it had massive holes in it which I thought were spiders coming to get me. So I would always high tail it around the corner near shoes on my way upstairs. Also, worried my father would beat the fuck out of me/mom.

 Well, what happened was I was watching that food show on travel network with that one guy...what's his name ...Bizarre Foods with [Andrew Zimmern and saw him eat some fried tarantula](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZkhpRfqsI0) so my friend went to the store and bought one. We fried it, using the ingredients we saw in the show and then ate it. It wasn't all that bad, kind of nutty. Then I had a guy come over late at night and we fucked and I sucked his cock.

 Agreed. I'd really like to see a free for all 1v1v1v1v1v1v1 or something similar. That way it's not so much team anymore. It would be a nice change of pace than being 4v4 all the time.  




 Money isn't really worth much though. I have about 500K right now and nothing to spend it on lol.  




 I've had this problem too. The key to tower control is one person or two on the tower and hte other two out in support usually inf ront would be nice. I always put an Ink mine on the tower in the event I die, the other guy dies too. But What I don't understand is why they just stand there staring at it when no one is around. GET ON IT AND MOVE IT. Or they just jump off for some random reason and then no one is on it. You can see how many people are on it easily.  




 I'm not entirely sure powering up the special midway through the match is advantageous. It takes time to go to the areas to ink to get enough energy to use your special- in that time you could have been doing the same amount if not more inking than what your nuke was worth. So I'm not entirely sure it is worth it- In the beginning yes, because everything is clear so it's easy to get special right off the bat but in the middle of the match it puts your team down a person allowing the other team to push while your off trying to get your special.  




 This one event didn't cause you to lose.  Don't just sit and cherry pick. Have multiple areas where you can shoot. 

I don't ever use beacons and I don't ever plan to. That being said I never jump where a teammate/enemies are. If I jump, which is rare, would be if my teammate is some place advantageous or it's the end of the game. 

Beacons are a waste of a sub because hardly anyone uses them, and the enemy just destroys them fast. As soon as I see an enemy beacon on my game pad that's the first place I go. Or I just nuke it. 

I try to stay as far away from people as I can and just splat the ground for turf war because that's the object to win the game. In splatzones I do the same, I make sure the splatzones are splatted and don't worry about killing people unless it's in defense or completely necessary. The most important thing is the area to be splatted.  




 That hasn't happened yet. I've never had to play more than 3 games in a row before getting a win. 

For instance, I just played now. I won, so I quit for the day I got +8 so I'm at +38 now. I got the +8 because I had As on my team 




 Well, I'm not the best shooter in the game but I've figured out a way to move up in ranking. 

I play one game per session online. If I win, I don't play any more ranked games till the next time I play Splatoon. 

If I lose, I get a new team, and play till I win. Then quit. This results in me having two end results at the end of a Splatoon session: 

1. My point/ranking stays the same
2. I move up +10 or +12 or whatever I get. 

I Have used this to move up from C to B. I have never gone 0-7 though in ranked or 0 anything in ranked. Sometimes for Tower Control I'll go like 10-16. In splatzones it's more like 6-5 or 5-4. 

I changed to this style because if I play too many ranked I get frustrated by my team at times. Now I don't get as frustrated.  




 You're terrible! 

Good job! 

Or 

Stop using a sniper in Turf Wars! 

Splat the ground!! 




 My views? You want my personal views on men/women? Because we're just talking about what male privilege is. 

I don't believe men are any more competent than women- no. But I agree with the statements and definition of male privilege I have given you.  




 Privilege is a real thing. But that doesn't mean it's a *bad* thing to acknowledge it. It's just a reality.  




 Sure. 


Kids have been trained for most of their lives to think of my gender as the authority.

They might have learned it at an early age when assertive girls were smacked down with labels like bossy "bitch" (see Lupe Fiasco's Bad Bitch song)  a reality that recently spurred the Ban Bossy campaign.

They might have learned it from watching media that rampantly objectifies women, often blurring the line between mainstream media and pornography.

They might have learned it from consistently seeing men over represented and women underrepresented in positions of power.

And I benefit from all of these lessons as a male.

 




 K. Here are some examples. 

As a male....I

1. I Have the Privilege of a Gender That Confers Authority

2. I Have the Privilege to Show Skin- That is men can take their shirts off and not be called sluts, whores..etc 

3. I Have the Privilege to Move About Without Fear of Harassment, Assault, or Rape

4. I Have the Privilege to Enjoy the Internet Without My Gender Being Assaulted

5. I Have the Privilege of Seeing Myself Widely and Positively Represented in the Media




**If you want more**

The Male Privilege Checklist

1. My odds of being hired for a job, when competing against female applicants, are probably skewed in my favor. The more prestigious the job, the larger the odds are skewed.

2. I can be confident that my co-workers wont think I got my job because of my sex  even though that might be true. 

3. If I am never promoted, its not because of my sex.

4. If I fail in my job or career, I can feel sure this wont be seen as a black mark against my entire sexs capabilities.

5. I am far less likely to face sexual harassment at work than my female co-workers are. 

6. If I do the same task as a woman, and if the measurement is at all subjective, chances are people will think I did a better job.

7. If Im a teen or adult, and if I can stay out of prison, my odds of being raped are relatively low. 

8. On average, I am taught to fear walking alone after dark in average public spaces much less than my female counterparts are.

9. If I choose not to have children, my masculinity will not be called into question.

10. If I have children but do not provide primary care for them, my masculinity will not be called into question.

11. If I have children and provide primary care for them, Ill be praised for extraordinary parenting if Im even marginally competent.

12. If I have children and a career, no one will think Im selfish for not staying at home.

13. If I seek political office, my relationship with my children, or who I hire to take care of them, will probably not be scrutinized by the press.

14. My elected representatives are mostly people of my own sex. The more prestigious and powerful the elected position, the more this is true.

15. When I ask to see the person in charge, odds are I will face a person of my own sex. The higher-up in the organization the person is, the surer I can be.

16. As a child, chances are I was encouraged to be more active and outgoing than my sisters. 

17. As a child, I could choose from an almost infinite variety of childrens media featuring positive, active, non-stereotyped heroes of my own sex. I never had to look for it; male protagonists were (and are) the default.

18. As a child, chances are I got more teacher attention than girls who raised their hands just as often. 

19. If my day, week or year is going badly, I need not ask of each negative episode or situation whether or not it has sexist overtones.

20. I can turn on the television or glance at the front page of the newspaper and see people of my own sex widely represented.

21. If Im careless with my financial affairs it wont be attributed to my sex.

22. If Im careless with my driving it wont be attributed to my sex.

23. I can speak in public to a large group without putting my sex on trial.

24. Even if I sleep with a lot of women, there is no chance that I will be seriously labeled a slut, nor is there any male counterpart to slut-bashing. 

25. I do not have to worry about the message my wardrobe sends about my sexual availability. 

26. My clothing is typically less expensive and better-constructed than womens clothing for the same social status. While I have fewer options, my clothes will probably fit better than a womans without tailoring. 

27. The grooming regimen expected of me is relatively cheap and consumes little time. 

28. If I buy a new car, chances are Ill be offered a better price than a woman buying the same car. 

29. If Im not conventionally attractive, the disadvantages are relatively small and easy to ignore.

30. I can be loud with no fear of being called a shrew. I can be aggressive with no fear of being called a bitch.

31. I can ask for legal protection from violence that happens mostly to men without being seen as a selfish special interest, since that kind of violence is called crime and is a general social concern. (Violence that happens mostly to women is usually called domestic violence or acquaintance rape, and is seen as a special interest issue.)

32. I can be confident that the ordinary language of day-to-day existence will always include my sex. All men are created equal, mailman, chairman, freshman, he.

33. My ability to make important decisions and my capability in general will never be questioned depending on what time of the month it is.

34. I will never be expected to change my name upon marriage or questioned if I dont change my name.

35. The decision to hire me will not be based on assumptions about whether or not I might choose to have a family sometime soon.

36. Every major religion in the world is led primarily by people of my own sex. Even God, in most major religions, is pictured as male.

37. Most major religions argue that I should be the head of my household, while my wife and children should be subservient to me.

38. If I have a wife or live-in girlfriend, chances are well divide up household chores so that she does most of the labor, and in particular the most repetitive and unrewarding tasks. 

39. If I have children with my girlfriend or wife, I can expect her to do most of the basic childcare such as changing diapers and feeding.

40. If I have children with my wife or girlfriend, and it turns out that one of us needs to make career sacrifices to raise the kids, chances are well both assume the career sacrificed should be hers.

41. Assuming I am heterosexual, magazines, billboards, television, movies, pornography, and virtually all of media is filled with images of scantily-clad women intended to appeal to me sexually. Such images of men exist, but are rarer.

42. In general, I am under much less pressure to be thin than my female counterparts are. If I am fat, I probably suffer fewer social and economic consequences for being fat than fat women do. 

43. If I am heterosexual, its incredibly unlikely that Ill ever be beaten up by a spouse or lover.

44. Complete strangers generally do not walk up to me on the street and tell me to smile. 

45. Sexual harassment on the street virtually never happens to me. I do not need to plot my movements through public space in order to avoid being sexually harassed, or to mitigate sexual harassment. 

45. On average, I am not interrupted by women as often as women are interrupted by men. 

46. I have the privilege of being unaware of my male privilege.

 No dude. Shortbus is a Canadian indy film about sex, orgasms, and orgies. There's a scene in the film, which takes place in NYC, where three gay guys are having a threesome and one of them uses his mouth like a trumpet and sings the national anthem in another guy's ass. It's graphic and shows all of this. [Here](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0367027/?ref_=nv_sr_1)

 /r/counting is a subreddit where you count things. For instance, they have a long going thread of counting numbers which started with 1 a few years ago. Then someone replies to 1 with "2" and so forth. You cannot reply to yourself. 

They had so many replies in a thread once that it messed with reddit's servers so now each thread in the count can only be 1000. So every 1000 counts, they start a new thread. Right now I believe they are on or around 430,000

There are other threads which count not just numbers like they have a count letters thread which starts with AAAA. The next would be AAAB, then AAAC....till AAAZ..then you would go AABA.. and so forth until you finish with ZZZZ. 

There is also counting with Binary numbers, counting palindromes (same backward/forward) only, evens, odds, counting subreddits. If you can count it- you can make a post which starts the count. 


Here is their [current thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/comments/3du07m/428k_counting_thread/)
 




 I wouldnt say they are.  




 /r/counting I didn't see the point of it. But then I started counting, I obtained some GETs and now I am obsessed with counting on their main counter thread.

Cousin died when we were both seventeen. There was a reception at his house just after the funeral. I went into his room and stole all the money that was there, took some other valuables that his parents wouldn't realize were gone. No one knows that I did it, they just assumed he didn't have any money in his room, only loose change. I don't regret it, but I will never admit I did it.
Also my cum box.

that is his answer

Elaborate on this cum box, please."**

His answer: 


Well, it is exactly what it sounds like. It's a shoebox, or at least once was, and whenever I masturbate I cum into it. I've had it for two or three years now I think, so it has a fair amount of cum. It smells atrocious, and I tried to burn it once. When I lit it on fire, it was too damp due to the cum that it simply sizzled and didn't manage to actually lite up. Turns out burning cum smells awful, so I had to spray it with a deodorant body spray just to get the old smell of burnt cum away. It also has some drenched papers stuck to it. That's pretty much it.

Because people were asking, my greatest shame.

EDIT 2: A lot of people are asking me, why? Well, I'm apparently a rather disturbed individual. But, it just kind of happened, bought new shoes and needed someplace to cum, used the box. It just escalated from there, kept using it each time, telling myself I would throw it out soon. Never did, two or three years later, I still have it. It was planned or anything, it just happened.

EDIT 3: Fuck, this really exploded. ~20,000+ views of my cum box. Did not expect this.

Edit 4: I often get PMed about updates or current status of the box, generally a few a week. So I might as well update this post, if anyone even gets linked here anymore. Current status, I have created life. Mold has begun to grow in the box and has taken over a fair amount. Smells a bit worse, mainly due to a damper apartment so it does not dry as fast, hence the reason why the mold has begun. New picture.

I will never be rid of my need for it. I hate and love the box, just as I hate and love myself.

 Interestingly in high school I had a teacher who had an affair with his student after she graduated and was 18. They got married and have been together for 15-20 years now.

 I suppose this one time my friend got really drunk and made himself a sandwich. He wanted to show it to me, his creation, but first he had to finish creating it. When he was finished he waddled over to me and showed me what he said was a Tuna Sandwich. In reality, it was miracle whip, mayonnaise, and grape jelly all in a gross mound between two pieces of bread. Then he ate it and his dog licked up everything that felt out of the back end of the sandwich. It was really gross. Also, my friend showed me the cumbox reddit post. That was odd.  




 Oh well.  




 The deception isn't in the photo, it's in their language when you talk to them about it. 

If you are so worried about being deceived just ask for a photo of their entire body of them standing up, within the last week. Problem solved.

 Male teacher here: No. That would be a bit creepy. One of the most important things they teach us in grad school is : Don't fuck your students. It's the number 1 rule that unfortunately still gets broken. Attraction is different yes, but I always remember that these students are younger, and developmentally not on the same level. Even when I was 22 and I had an 18 year old student. They just looked like students. I never saw them as an attraction.  




 I never posted FIFA crap. But I am not going to stop playing FIFA 16'. I enjoy it.

I guess that means I don't care about the slave workers.
