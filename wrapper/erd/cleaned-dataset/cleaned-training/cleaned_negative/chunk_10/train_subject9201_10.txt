 I drybrushed white over the gesso, *then* painted it.

And yeah, that site is hella 90s. Funny thing is, I have yet to find a better beginner painting tutorial site. 




 I am one of those people who paint by priming black, and drybrushing with white. 

I've done white with black wash on top, and it has some good and bad things. First of all, the end result ends up looking almost exactly the same. However, you can use washes other than black, and you can get a much brighter miniature, so that's a plus. However, I can never seem to have good luck with white primer. It always ends up chalky, or needs several coats for good coverage, or whatever. Also, you have to work a lot harder to get into the cracks and crevices (basically working hard twice, instead of once). I'm also a fan of the black-lining style of painting, so priming black is kind of a no-brainer.

If you really want, I can try to get some pictures of some from both.

Keep in mind, though, I'm a shit painter, and my goal is tabletop quality, not award winning. 




 I do this all the time. In fact, I [did it](http://imgur.com/a/TVYeJ) just a few hours ago.

I learned it from [this guy](http://www.how-to-paint-miniatures.com/), which is the first site that came up for learning to paint miniatures in a search for "painting miniatures" in Google when I first started.

edit: oh, and as for why, for one, it allows me to put lighter colors on a black primed mini without as many layers, and two, how the hell can you see where to put the paint when it's all flat black?

edit2: oh, and 3, you can prime and highlight white and you can see the details enough to start using them if you don't have enough time to fully paint them yet. 




 For the "if everything is weird, nothing is" thing, the two times I ran a "Numenera" setting I did a stock medieval world, and a stock space opera world. This gave a nice baseline so that I can then add in weirder things when I wanted to, but that's not what the players were used to expecting.

For giving the system teeth, 2 of my campaigns I put a hard cap on Tier at Tier 2. Like you said, starting at Tier 3 players just get ridiculous. 

Another time the set weapon damage in the book was only for "improvised" weapons. Actual manufactured weapons did much more damage (usually in line with a lot of the weapon-like artifacts). 

I've done conversions of other systems to something akin to the Cypher system where I only had two pools instead of three, and in one, I had only one pool of 5 points. That's basically a whole different game though. 




 So, /r/shauni55 asked, and I had planned on testing this out anyway, so I got them out and got to work.

[Here](http://imgur.com/a/TVYeJ) is what I found out.

I primed them with black gesso, which worked great. I scratched at it and it didn't flake off, and it completely dried without being tacky. Spray primer would probably be completely different though. You might get by using paint without primer, but it'd be kind of iffy. The plastic was just a bit reluctant to take to the gesso at first, and paint might not hold to it.

After priming it painted just like any other mini, though the detail isn't fantastic on some of them. The Razor Boars seemed pretty good, though I don't have metal ones to compare them to. The Brigands were definitely inferior to the metal versions, but not so bad as to look horrible from afar.

After the paint dried, I bent and twisted the minis some, and the paint held to it. It probably wouldn't hurt to put a sealer on though (I'll try that after I fully paint them).

Let me know if you have any questions, I probably forgot to mention something. 




 Okay, I'm sold. When and where can I buy it?

The artwork is very nice; it's right on the edge of what I consider to be not too "animated" looking.  

I fully plan to use this as a gateway drug to get boardgamers/children into RPGs. 




 Because Skorne are hideous and Trolls are beautiful, so it gives a nice contrast. 




 I have that StarCraft box set, and I bring it with me whenever I go gaming just in case someone wants to play it (they never have). It's a very convenient size for something you're never going to use. 




 Yeah, they reduced character creation from 10 hours to about 3 hours. I don't think I could run it without pre-mades without the Transhuman book. 




 Well, he didn't say complex. He said cluttered and impractical, which is exactly how I'd describe the WH games (I've played about half of them).

It's not complex at all. Percentile systems are pretty much the opposite of complex.  




 Rogue Trader might win this one just for its tables alone. 

Eclipse Phase could possibly win for it's character creation, though.

Honestly I love them both. I've also tried converting both, and failed, because you can't really reduce them down without losing a lot of what makes them special. Best thing I've found is printing off quick reference guides to help out.

Any game worse than those I usually just read, and then never run because I can see how ridiculous they are. Then I steal the setting and use different rules. 




 Are they even from the same faction?

You won't really be using them both at the same time (at least until you play ridiculously huge games). However, when you have more than one caster from the same faction, you can swap them out, and the difference in their spells and abilities change the way your army plays.  




 It gives it depth. It gives the world you are playing in structure that makes it, not only believable, but *tangible*. The more rules a system has the more ways you have to interact with that world. 

I play Iron Kingdoms a lot, and it's one of the crunchier systems out there. When I sit there and micromanage my gold to be able to keep my steamjack fueled makes me feel like I'm really taking part in an economy. 

Fate is about taking part in a **story**, crunchier games are about taking part in a **world**. 




 I've used it almost from the moment it was released. I've run 2 full several year long campaigns, and countless one shots.

It's definitely a nice piece of software, and I've tried a lot of the other virtual tabletops, and none really do as well. It's very reliable, and has every feature that I really would want to use for a vtt. 

The only thing, is it's online, and if you are dealing with online people, they are usually pretty flaky. When I use it to play with friends, it's great, but I haven't managed to keep a group of strangers together for very long. This is not the software's fault, though.
 




 Yeah, uh, considering the alternative is just dead-dead, I'd say you're being pretty easy on him. If he doesn't like it, he can stay dead.

If he rolls up a new character, make sure it's a lvl 1 character, too.  




 Smallest points based size games are generally 15 points (smaller than that is "battlebox" games, which is just a warnoun and their beasts/jacks). Most tournaments are in the 35-50 range. I've been playing for years and I've never actually played a 75pt game (though now that I say that, I really think I want to). 




 After you start to get a grasp on the rules, start doing scenario games. The game is really designed around having scenarios, and terrain, and without it it can get stale pretty quick. 

Prepare to lose. You might do fine, especially with not being new to wargames, but you get better at WM/H the more you know. You can even do better in games with an inferior army if you are more familiar with it.

I'd say "start small", but I don't know much about that. I had 75pts  in two different factions before I played my first game.  




 The core mechanic is this:

The GM decides how difficult something is, on a scale of 1 to 10. That's its difficulty. The players then tell you their skills and abilities that might make the task easier, reducing the difficulty. The final difficulty is multiplied by 3, and that's the target number. The player rolls a d20, and if they meet or exceed the target number, they succeed at their task. 

Example:
John wants to jump across a wide gap in the floor. I decide that it's pretty far, and give it a difficulty of 5. John is trained in jumping tasks because he's an athletic sort of guy, so that reduces the difficulty to 4. He's also going to spend effort (effort is basically burning HP to push yourself), so that brings the task difficulty to 3. Lastly, he says he's going to get a running start, which I decide is an asset and that makes the final difficulty to 2. The target number is 6, so if John rolls a 6 or higher, he makes it across. 

Another fun part of the system is GM intrusions, which are basically the GM paying the players XP so that he can screw with them. 

In the above example, I could offer John an XP to have him make it across, but he stumbles a bit and knocks some boards loose, making it harder for the next person to cross. If a player rolls a 1 on the die, you get to use an intrusion on them for free.

Another thing, Monte Cook has a raging hard-on for how awesome cyphers are in the game (they are single use magic items, like a potion or scroll). He even named the system after them. It's not that exciting to me (single use magic items have been a thing for a long time, Monte), and they don't really feature into my games very often. They are not the selling point of the game. You could rip out those pages and I'd still buy the book. 

Also, a lot of people get all nerd ragey any time you talk about running a Cypher system game that doesn't use the settings that come with them (Numenera or The Strange). I don't get that. This system is able to run almost any setting imaginable really well. The new Cypher system book coming out should get people to see that (I hope). 




 One of the most competitive lists for a while had 3 full units of Gatormen Posse. That probably doesn't seem strange coming from 40k (especially orks), but it's pretty unusual for WM/H. Thing is, it's already getting better (Croak Raiders just came out, and I hear they are awesome). It's both a newer faction, and a faction meant to be able to combine with other factions, so it has less variety. The problem with not having variety is that it's harder to have answers to lots of different lists (WM/H is kinda rock/paper/scissor-y, and if all you have are rocks, paper armies are going to be a problem for you). Again though, they are getting new models all the time, and a lot of the models they have are really solid (Gatormen Posse are probably the best heavy infantry in the game). 

If you are serious about running minions competitively, I would check out the [Privateer Press forums](http://privateerpressforums.com/forumdisplay.php?74-Minions-List-Discussion) and read through the discussions on there.  




 If you are interested in minions, play minions. 

Mercs/Minions are both a little on the weak side, but not really. It's more that they have fewer strong options.

Mercs could be a little easier to play, but only if you are buying one of the colossals. 

Warmachine and Hordes are the same game, don't let anyone fool you. The only differences are in how Warlocks/Warbeasts work in comparison to Warcasters/Warjacks (a decent difference, but not enough to make one harder than the other).

But yeah, if you like minions play minions. If you want more options but still want to use your minions, do like lolredditor said and get some Skorne to go with them. 




 I highly recommend the Cypher system of Numenera or The Strange. 




 The rules are simple... for the GM. Honestly, I was playing a variation of the Cypher system before it came out, the Cypher system just gives my players more shit to read through. 




 Cypher System: because I am a lazy fuck.

Seriously. Someone could show up at my house early in the morning saying, "We're here to game, all day," and I would be able to crawl out of bed and start running a Cypher system game immediately, with 0 prep, and would be able to run it for days, if necessary, with 0 prep and without having to crack open a book once, all while letting the players have the pleasure of a moderately crunchy, narrative focused game with balanced encounters. It has plenty of fun content for the players, and everything for the GM is just helpful pointers for newbs.

edit: also, it has great rules for miniatures without using a grid (grids, of course, being an abomination) 




 Are you, uh, asking for a "friend"? *wink* 




 Sadly, I think it qualifies. Though it has been picking up in popularity since Unleashed came out. 




 You seem like you need a little [IKRPG](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/146332/Iron-Kingdoms-Unleashed-An-Introduction-to-Savagery) in your life. 




 I always laugh when people talk about poor bones quality, and then pick up one of my painted minis that they thought was metal and are surprised to find out it was a bones figure. 




 [Get 5e.](https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules) 




 The classes and abilities are extremely rigid, and it makes using them in a variety of situations difficult. It gets very hard to break from the "I use [Insert Ability Name Here]." over and over style of play. It requires zero creativity, but also allows zero creativity. It is very heavily invested in making the abilities "balanced", and allowing someone to use an ability creativity breaks this balance, and makes other player's ability choices (which is the focus of the game) unimportant. 




 Those are pretty amazing. 

I'm still trying to get the balls enough to try LARP, but I admire the people who can do it. Maybe I'll start by trying a few photos of tabletop characters first. 




 You would have done a lot better if you had gear. Paladins are meant to have armor, and barbarians are meant to be fine without it, which means the situation was stacked in their favor. That's just one obvious way that the situation wasn't a good measure. The other is it is a cooperative game. How the classes interact with one another as a team is considerably different than how they do 1 vs 1. For one thing, paladins are spellcasters, and healers, which dramatically changes their role from a barbarian, which you seem to think is identical. 

Arenas in rpgs are pretty dumb most of the time, and 9 times out of 10 it means the GM doesn't give two shits. 




 D D, and really, most roleplaying games, are built for cooperative play. 

If you are looking to be competitive, I highly recommend something like Warmachine or Deadzone. 




 The first question is dependent on the second. Technically, it's not really "in print", since it was a limited run. If you can only find it for $300 or something, it's not really worth it. If you can get it at MSRP or lower, it's a good deal.  




 I've never been burnt out on roleplaying. Burnt out on a certain system, or a certain group, or burnt out on running games for ungrateful little shits maybe, but never burnt out on the whole thing. 

In fact, my favorite kind of campaigns are the ones that last years. My longest campaign ran 6 years, and they barely scratched the surface of the campaign world. 

I don't do 1 on 1. I don't know, I just don't think it really works well for me, with maybe the exception of personal side quests. If it's me and one other person, I'd rather just play a wargame. 




 I don't think anyone actually read your post, mate.

Here's some of mine:

[Never Split the Party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waa2ucfgVgQ)

[Critical Hit Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA0erM_B3CA) 




 You didn't specify a price limit, so [here](http://www.miniaturemarket.com/mgma51-1.html?___store=mmonline ___store=mmonline utm_source=GoogleShopping gclid=Cj0KEQjwz6KtBRDwgq-LsKjMk9kBEiQAuaxWUqjfK3XOWqfWXhwk1ir8ojvKdemkl-06P7pcpab3UdAaAj1g8P8HAQ). You can't tell from the picture, but it has a grid. 3 inch squares, though. You could buy 3 of them for 60 bucks and that would be a helluva nice road. They are made out of a mouse pad-like material, and are super durable.

You might also want to check out the scenery packs they have for that game, as they are pretty good for post-apocalypse.  




 There is no colossal that is a must take in every list

Tell that to the Mercs players. 




 What can I say? We're just a bunch of grognards who won't give up the old traditions. 




 All of them. Every single one. There's no such thing as an original idea. 

You probably don't want to believe me, but go ahead and post your ideas here, and just from the sample of people who read your post you will probably get dozens with the same idea.

Good News: Ideas aren't what people buy. Execution of ideas is what people want. The blood, sweat, tears, and expertise put into a thing is what will make people enjoy what you have to offer. If you don't have any of those things in your thing yet, keep working on it till you do.

Also, it's not a problem to have more than one of a thing. Don't try to "fill a void in the market" or whatever bullshit assholes from 50 years ago will tell you. This is the 21st century, there are no holes in the market. Just do what you love, and if you want to share it with other people, do. 




 Male, GM, and I can't really tell the difference when gaming (if by "gaming groups" you mean sex, then I prefer just women). Gender isn't usually an issue when gaming, though my groups don't put our genitalia on the table, so YMMV. 




 If you are going to run your world, run your world. Just give them a rundown of what is and isn't available, that way they can start working on characters that do fit.

If you are interested in including the players in world construction, you can maybe take a look at [Fate Core](http://fate-srd.com/fate-core/game-creation)'s Game Creation as an example of a system that is intended to include players in world construction. 

If you really want to go all out, I've had a lot of fun using [Microscope RPG](http://www.lamemage.com/microscope/) with my players to create the setting, and then running a game in it using another system (usually the Cypher System, but you can use whatever floats your boat). 




 Unless by "torment", you mean not letting her out her cage to eat, you really have no fuggin clue what evil means. 




 Four? Lucky bastard. That's about 6 less than me. 




 They sort of have two ways to reproduce. They reproduce the fun way, which produces babies, and they raise them to be full fledged whatever they are. All true trolls (Trollkin are somewhat like "half-trolls"), can also "reproduce" when a piece of them gets cut off. This is more to do with the rampant regeneration than it does with reproducing. These are not really full fledged creatures that reproduce on their own, and are more like a foot that grew it's own brain (and arms and legs and whatnot). These are the whelps, and they are less like children, and more like pets. And really, that's only for people who eat their pets. 

There are (in order of size, from smallest to largest): Whelps, Pygs/Pygmy Trolls, Trollkin, Trolls, Dire Trolls, Mountain Trolls?

While all are technically related, they aren't really one race that breeds together. 

I hope that confused things a bit for you. 




 [IKRPG](http://files.privateerpress.com/ironkingdoms/documents/adventures/IKRPG_Scenario_Fools_Rush_In.pdf) has a pretty solid alchemy ruleset. 

The [Unleashed version](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/146332/Iron-Kingdoms-Unleashed-An-Introduction-to-Savagery) of the rules has a "Bone Grinder" which is like an alchemist who uses people as ingredients.
