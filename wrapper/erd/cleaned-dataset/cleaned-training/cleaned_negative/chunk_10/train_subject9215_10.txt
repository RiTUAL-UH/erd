The top and bottom bezels are too big in my opinion and that's due to the home button. Look at the LG G3 or G4 for instance. They have small bezels and the bigger screen doesn't seem as big... 







































 Apple didn't invent the shape. The article says the future of tablets is 4:3 instead of 16:9 

















































 you're right. Another thing is, the home button cannot have the metal ring "inside" the screen. Am I right ? 




 I use safari with 3 tabs max and it's usable. Sure it's slow compared to the iPhone but it's from 2012. It's a usable iPad for reading magazines, books and web 





























 It's nice to have a device with 5 years and to be used daily. I have an iPad 3 and it lags a bit with iOS8 in safari, but it's usable for everyday tasks. I use it everyday 



















 iOS 7 in the 4 was rubbish, way to laggy. In the 4s it was also laggy. iOS 9 in the 4s is smooth 









 yes 




 In short: It's really good. Night and day compared to iOS7

 It's also an entry device for the apple ecosystem. The iPod touch 4th gen was my first Apple device. Two iPhones and one iPad came next
