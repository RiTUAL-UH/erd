 Thanks you! I hope it helps. 




 Great question.

We have found that people overwhelmingly prefer a good photo with a short review to a long written review.

Foodworthy gives a real-time view of the food people are eating in your area (assuming there is enough people in your area). With every photo that is shared through the app, you can include a short review and a ranking. Every photo links to a specialized restaurant page, showcasing what others have eaten at that restaurant. You can also find location specific information including directions, hours, dietary options and more. 




 Thank you. Finding food I want to eat has been one of the most challenging things, hopefully this will solve that problem 




 Thank you for your support! I hope you enjoy it!
