 Did you hear what Holland said about takfir? 









 I don't like the author's use of the phrase 'ill afford'. However, I believe this may interest some and provide food for thought. 




 Newar Buddhism is sometimes accused of being a confused mixture of Hinduism and Buddhism. Given he social and political situation of the country, it is perhaps inevitable that there would be a certain blurring of the lines between the two. However, the contention is based on the debatable supposition that there were at any time in India clear-cut distinctions between the two at the level of folk religionsthat is, at the level of the religious practice of the laity. Later innovations in practice and doctrine were, no doubt, largely introduced into Buddhism and interpreted in a Buddhist sense by the teachers of the age precisely because they were current among the masses. Moreover for the last six hundred years in Nepal there has been social and political pressure on the Buddhist community to conform more to orthodox Hindu customs. As a result, this process, which was an ongoing one throughout the history of Buddhism in India, has continued in Nepal. Festivals, images, customs, and the like were adopted and given a Buddhist meaning. Finally, there is a great similarity between the yogic practices and the iconography of Hindu and Buddhist tantrism. The philosophical differences between Hindu and Buddhist interpretations of even the most fundamental tantric concepts are profound, but once the spirit of scholarship began to decline the differenes were no longer so clear. hence the seeming confusion of the present situation is due rather to a decline of scholarship and the incarnation of Buddhism in Indian religious culture, than to a fusion of Hinduism and Buddhism peculiar to the Valley of Nepal.

The opening of Nepal in 1951 to the outside world, the passage of a new legal code, and the spread of educaton in the valley have brought the Buddhist community of the valley to a juncture. The legal code has removed restrictions of caste, a social phenomenon having no justification in Buddhist teaching but with tenacious vested interests in the Buddhist community. The educated youth are drifting away from old rituals and practices as their world becomes increasingly secularized. The economic situation of the valley is changing from a purely agricultural one to one in which more an d more people are engaged in business, government service, the tourist industry, etc. The result is that the ancient round of feasts and festivals is becoming an economic burden and a sacrifice of time people can ill afford. The youth of the Buddhist community are devout and the social force of their religion is still strong, but the social structure is weakening and they are looking for something more relevant. At the same time the level of scholarship among the Vajracharyas leaves them withouth proper guidance. At least some of the younger Vajracharyas are aware of the problem and have recently formed a group to face the present challenge and adapt their traditions.

 aren't feasible

I don't know what you're basing that on. Consider this:

**A + B  B**

Increasing the number of stages in the food production process by eating animal products, rather than plant matter first hand, creates waste. According to Joni Seager et. al in The State of the Environment Atlas,
In cycling our grain through livestock, we wasted 90% of its protein and 96% of its calories. An acre of cereal can produce five times more protein than an acre devoted to meat production; and legumes (beans, lentils, peas) can produce ten times as much. Thus the greater the human consumption of animal products, the fewer people can be fed.

An omnivorous diet wastes resources that the world just does not have. Faced with a growing population, we must use our resources as efficiently as possible so as to avoid famine, conflict over scarce resources, and climate chaos.

**Land**

According to a UN Food and Agricultural Organisation 2005 report The State of Food Insecurity in the World, a varied vegan diet only needs a fifth of the land of a typical European omnivorous diet. The animal industry has a devastating impact on the land. Expansion of livestock production is a key factor in deforestation. In a process known as hamburgerisation cattle graze on cleared land, moving to yet more land once they have destroyed the fertility of the soil. World Resources Institute assessments suggest that 20-30 per cent of the worlds forest areas have already been converted to agriculture. To feed animals in order to eat animal products will not satisfy humanitys food needs.

**Water**

Animal production uses huge quantities of water to grow crops for their feed, for them to drink, and during the processing of their carcasses. A study financed by the California Beef Council found that the production of one kilogram of beef uses 3700 litres of water, the equivalent of 40 baths or 300 toilet flushes. A different study from Cornell University put the water usage for one kilogram of beef at 100,000 litres. For comparison a kilogram of maize uses 77 litres, wheat 119, and barley 2174. With more than one billion people already unable to access enough safe water to meet their needs5, and this number likely to rise, we must prioritise a sustainable diet over a meat-based one.

 You'd have to look at the nuts and bolts of the particular study but you might be surprised by how low their criteria for 'heavy drinker' is. I was reading yesterday of a study in which over 20 drinks a month was considered heavy!

Plus I'd echo the 'Welcome to Europe' commentator in emphasising that cultures have different norms. One can become 'brain-dead' both physiologically and sociologically.

 Ok. So you're talking geographically not demographically. The difference between a planet and a world relies on the presence of an experiencer, the existence of a consciousness.  




 Because I believe that animal suffering and exploitation is a matter of extreme importance. 

Whether someone is a vegan is a heuristic that allows me to identify them as someone who shares my views on this matter and thus receive my support and cooperation. 

I trust that I am not alone on either of these points.

 Something tells me you haven't read the article. 




 This is the article the Independent's piece referred to:

**A 15-year-old dies but the war goes on. Why wont we make drugs legal?**



The world is not the same for me now, says Anne-Marie Cockburn, whose 15-year-old daughter, Martha Fernback, died after taking ecstasy. But if someone like me can pave the way for change, that would be good.

Ms Cockburn has hauntingly beautiful eyes  the fact that her only child had the same eyes makes the pictures of them unbearably poignant. But she is unusual in another way too. As a bereaved parent, she is not demanding some kind of crackdown. She is asking  quietly and sombrely  for drugs to be regulated and legalised.

When Martha Fernback died, it was not the first ecstasy tablet she had taken. What her mother has painfully had to accept is that perfectly normal teenagers take foolish risks. High or dead? she says. No parent wants either, but one is preferable.

We have all been teenagers. We have all known the attraction of doing something illicit, dangerous. Yet the whole war on drugs is predicated on a wilful misreading of human psychology: the insistence that criminalising drugs will stop people taking them.

On the contrary. In the latest British Crime Survey 16% of 16 to 24-year-olds in the UK admit that they have dabbled in drugs in the past year. Given that respondents are admitting to something illegal, the true figure is likely to be higher.

The same thing happened under Prohibition in America in the 1920s and 1930s. The ban on liquor increased the number of hard drinkers, even though alcohol prices soared. It also created a criminal class of bootleggers, whose financial interest lay in supplying alcohol and encouraging their customers to become addicted.

Todays bootleggers, in the drugs trade, have made this into a fine art. With their sports cars, tattoos and jewellery, they are role models for many kids on bleak estates. They offer free samples. They evade the police and customs. They know how to stealthily upgrade their customers from soft stuff to hard. Cocaine has moved up to crack and cannabis to skunk, concentrated forms that are devastating. And they increase their profits by cutting drugs such as ecstasy and cocaine with other substances. The inquest into Martha Fernbacks death heard that the average street-level purity of ecstasy is 58%. These products can be more dangerous than the pure forms of the drugs, as any A E doctor will testify.

Britains equivalent of Prohibition was the 1971 Misuse of Drugs Act. Before that, addiction was treated as an illness, and heroin addicts were prescribed their drugs by their GP. There were very few addicts, and no crime associated with heroin. The effect of the act was to hand these people over to unscrupulous gangs who had every incentive to turn more people into junkies  and many of those turned to crime to feed their habit.

The result is that, in 40 years, Britain turned roughly 10,000 addicts into something more like 250,000. The resulting misery affects not only those people and their families, but all the people whove been threatened and robbed. The cost of drug-related crime in England and Wales is estimated at 14bn a year. Then theres the cost of keeping people in prison. About 10% of the prison population is there for possession or supply, but most need treatment, not punishment.

No other industry of this scale is unregulated, untaxed and in the hands of criminals. Drugs are now the second-largest revenue-earner for organised crime, with profit margins sometimes higher than those on luxury goods. Those profits fuel all sorts of other nasty crimes, including trafficking. The Sunday Times has recently exposed the fact that cannabis drug lords are trafficking Vietnamese girls to work in UK nail bars.

Legalising production, supply and consumption could put paid to the whole, vile industry. Putting the market in the hands of licensed sellers would make the supply safer. And going into the corner shop, rather than sidling up to someone on the street, might make the whole act of purchase less glamorous.

Admittedly, if buying an ecstasy tablet became as easy as buying a pack of cigarettes, usage would probably rise, at least at first. And the state is understandably uncomfortable about appearing to condone a dangerous habit. But the annual number of deaths from alcohol and tobacco dwarfs the annual number of deaths from drugs.

Licensed drug sellers would also pay tax. Together with the 2bn spent on fighting the drugs trade each year, this money could treat addiction and fund education campaigns. Overcrowded prisons would be relieved of people who are desperately vulnerable to drugs while inside. A doctor recently explained to me how random drug tests encourage inmates to move on to harder drugs: unlike cannabis, which stays in the body for weeks, opiates can be sweated out in two days.

Big cracks are beginning to show in what was once a solid wall of global prohibition. In defiance of the UN-mandated war on drugs, more and more countries are beginning to experiment. Last week the Jamaican government announced that it will decriminalise possession of marijuana. And the drugs policy charity Transform published a report on Portugal, which decriminalised the possession of all drugs for personal use in 2001. The report finds that drug-related deaths have decreased. And while lifetime drug use has increased slightly, use seems to have declined among the 15-24 age group.

These moves from prejudice to evidence are hugely cheering. In Holland city mayors are lobbying the government to let them supply cannabis to coffee shops. Uruguay has become the first country to regulate cannabis possession, production and supply. The US states of Washington and Colorado are doing something similar, and Oregon and Nevada are likely to vote soon.

It is time for British politicians to look again at what is being learnt around the globe. Once you accept that people have not been deterred from taking drugs, policy can become more pragmatic. Holland has walk-in labs where users can test the purity of a drug they are about to take.

Responding to Anne-Marie Cockburns comments after the inquest this week, the crime prevention minister Norman Baker made the following statement: The UKs approach on drugs remains clear: we must prevent drug use in our communities, help dependent individuals through treatment and wider recovery support, while ensuring law enforcement protects society by stopping the supply.

Those last three words give the game away. We are not stopping the supply. We have lost control of it.

As a Liberal Democrat, Mr Baker should be challenging such an illiberal policy. It takes a brave politician to overcome the hysteria that occludes this issue. But the fact that the war on drugs has failed is demonstrated by the fact that a middle-class girl in a north Oxford school has died. Her mothers courageous plea deserves a proper hearing  and a more coherent response.
