 It's in Blue Ash, a small city outside Cincinnati, OH.  




 Yes, it is a potato latke, also very delicious!  














 I don't think Saul is dead, yet. When Saul asked to speak to Carrie on the phone when he first escaped, he made her promise to take him out if he were to be captured again and Carrie failed to keep this promise. She had to deal with the emotions that followed that decision. I think somehow Saul gets "captured" or taken again by Haqqani, thus Carrie will have to deal a similar decision of killing both Haqqani and Saul, OR there is a possibility of Saul taking his own life while killing Haqqani at the same time. Either way, I think Saul's capture really took a toll on Saul not only physically but mentally and morally. When it comes down to it either Carrie "pulls the trigger" killing Saul and Haqqani, or Saul does it. Either way I'm ready for the new episode now. 




 Sitting in class when I opened the post, instant goose bumps
