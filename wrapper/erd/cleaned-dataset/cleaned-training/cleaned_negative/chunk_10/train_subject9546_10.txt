 May 2nd. Just me and The People's Champ The Rock 




 I will admit living here in nh it is a bit tougher to get really good squeaky curds.   They were pretty good though 




 Haha.   You are too funny you know that 




 I love the woodland creature analogy.   And I don't listen to rap because I'm not a teenager from the 90s/early 2000s (the last time it was relevant) 




 Actually I did look them up and I still don't know who the fuck he is.   Some random flavor of the week rapper??  So guess your comment is fucking wrong.  




 So now with ambrose and harper in the mix it's two Internet vs an Internet and one wwe 




 Who the hell is Future? 




 I said cheese curds in my comment describing it more. 




 Are you fucking serious?!?

Because he has literally had a handful of matches on the main shows.  He is still in the very early stages of his career in the WWE. 

I wish his character either had more depth or they just pushed him as an asshole that can have a really good match

He is literally that.  He is an asshole that has had amazing matches.
 




 The whole "I KICK ASS" gimmick

Is not his gimmick.  His gimmick is a guy who is doing everything to provide the best life for his family.  And if that means being an asshole and kicking some ass to get the accolades to provide the best life for his family, then that is what he will do. 




 I know he does a lot of scouting for the company.  I feel like he is viewed as a loyal employee and an asset to them. 




 True... although it is tough to sell properly when the kicks were so poorly timed on Brie's part. 




 You mean like Brie's amazing selling from last night?? lol  Man that was pitiful. 




 Cooked chicken breasts with onions, carrots, celery, and jalapenos in my crock pot on low for 7 hours.   Pulled the chicken and took the stock to make chicken gravy.  Thin sliced potatoes and baked them with oil salt pepper and garlic.  Topped the fries with the chicken, cheese curds, and the gravy.  Amazing stuff. 









 Hell will freeze over before Vince admits he was wrong about certain wrestlers/things 




 I was thinking of that Sweetness move he did that was similar to the Zig-Zag.  He has changed moves too many times to keep track lol. 




 yes... which rarely happened lol 




 it was like a spinning headscissors into the armbar 




 yeah... and while we are at it let's get rid of DDTs, Powerbombs, Superkicks, etc etc etc.  Oh and by the way, the Zig-Zag is in no way an STO.  Same goes for Slater's.  They are neckbreakers if anything.  Sister Abigail is a spinning reverse STO and it looks damn good and devsatating.

 Diva's tag team match for me 




 I know right... it's not like they made special note that he was out there.  Plus it also ties into the whole HHH backing him thing.  HHH  gave him opportunity and he is paying him back for it by helping. 




 Honestly I enjoyed last night's show.  But then again I usually do when others piss and moan and whine about them. 




 Damn, who forgot to pay the troll toll? 




 Everything from that one moment, to the other one, and even that other one, and those ones too makes it totally worth watching 




 ...HERE COMES THE MONEY! !!!!!! 




 I do not like over-sell man. .. I do not like him RedFnPan...da 




 What is /s ? 




 I'd like to see them do something incorporating their Millions of Dollars dance, like a double leg drop. 




 Ziggler.. .not as Nicky, not as Nick Nemeth the caddy, not as Ziggler, not as brown hair Ziggler, not as bad Ziggler, good Ziggler, Vickie BF Ziggler.  None of them. 




 FOUR FUCKING MOVES

You're damn right and they are:

EAT!

SLEEP!

SUPLEX!

REPEAT! 




 Kevin Steen 




 Undertaker is deathly afraid of cucumbers. 




 ...is Carmen SanDiego!  Sorry I couldn't help myself.  Probably lying on the side of the ring or made his way to the back.  You'd run too if you got hit with the Taker lights. 




 You could easily discuss it in one of the 20-30+ other posts saying the exact same thing.  But instead you make a new one and clutter up the sub. 




 I realize this seems like a foolish question

Then:

a. Why the fuck did you ask it?

b. Why the fuck didn't you bother to see others have asked it?

c.  WHY THE FUCK DID YOU ASK IT?????!!!???? 




 https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/3dz6ik/was_spoiler_suppose_to_be_a_heel/

Literally posted 4 minutes before you 




 He got in more offense than Cena did in his match with Lesnar at Summerslam.  He was going at him good and starting to weaken his leg.  Honestly since he beat the streak the only other person to make him look weak was Reigns.  So it wasn't as much one-sided as it was heavy handed on the Lesnar side. 




 Don't let the shit door hit you on the way out. 




 Not weak... chickenshit.  But when push comes to shove he can go in the ring. 




 Mulva? 




 But just a woman is ok, right Mr. Snuka? 




 1. Wyatt no because he is still feuding with Reigns
2. HHH yes because that seems to be the plan all along
3. Rock no because if anything he will be back for Mania
4. Reigns no (see Wyatt)
5. Shield Triple Threat no because it is too soon.  Mania maybe? 




 Damien Wyatt-dow 




 [SPOILERS] 

It happens and making a new sub won't change it.

 But Undertaker is not a mortal man.  Making him look like Rocky takes away the entire Undertaker aura 




 I am in no way a Cena mark.  I just hate people spewing them same BS rhetoric on here just because they think it is cool.  People just like to blame Cena but in fact it is many factors that go into people not getting pushed. 




 Because the act of losing to John Cena has really been the only thing that has put them in their current positions?  Wow you are fucking stupid. 




 Wow... there is so much wrong with that that my head hurts.  

You have no clue what was intended for Rusev if he hadn't gotten injured.  He was supposed to be in the IC title match and there was a good chance he was going to win. 

Wyatt has always been the character that wanders and randomly feuds with others.  This was happening before he ever started the Cena feud.  Also, the guy got to face Taker at Wrestlemania which is something someone who is doing poorly wouldn't get an opportunity for.  He is also in a meaningful feud with someone the company views as one of it's top stars, whom he also beat last night.  

Not everyone can be in the title pictures so there will be feuds with others.  People automatically view someone not feuding for a title as they are buried and just losers.  There is too much importance set on the titles being the only way a wrestler is not "buried".

All of these people are still on TV and getting stories and feuds so yeah... 




 Did you not see the interview with him afterwards where he explained that tapping out was his choice because he didn't want to risk injury, ergo he could not provide for his family.  That hands down fits his character.  So before you make these statements learn all the facts.

 Bubs... I mean he is the smartest guy in the trailer park. 




 "Mama always said life is like a box of liquor..." 




 safetyalwaysoff 




 You had a great match between Wyatt and reigns in which Wyatt won  (everyone bitches he never wins), a great divas match in which an nxt diva won,  another quality Cena/Owens match,  suplex city running wild bitch,  and the return of taker.   Sounds like an amazing ppv.  You on the other hand sound like a whiner who can never be pleased 




 Cry a little more 




 Quit whining.   The title of the post said joke you knew what to expect.   Also,  /r/wrasslin had always been for memes and images not jokes. 




 Doesn't matter.   She still got it in both cases.  




 She was fired due to ziggler winning the match.   Sounds like a comeuppance to me.  




 So Vickie tossing her into the slop is not comeuppance? ??? 




 I usually Odd myself 




 The Rock Bottom...wait? 




 Neville: The Car-Neville

 




 almost like two people were making it at the same time?  Not like this person was out to repost. 




 1. Skull Crushing Finale
2. RKO
3. Brogue Kick
4. Red Arrow 




 Lil Jimmy 




 Who the fuck is Frank the Clown? 




 Randy Orton... I feel like it will be a breath of fresh air seeing as the two have barely wrestled each other in their tenure with the company. 




 But she mentioned all Paige has done and talked her up.  She also said she wanted Paige out there when Nikki questioned her.  Doesn't sound like burying to me.  Sounds like you are nitpicking an entire segment to try and make a point that is not there.

 Owens, Cesaro, Rusev, New Day, NXT Horsewomen, Paige... pretty much a ton of NXT fresh hot current wrestlers are getting pushed.  So fail?

 Not in a wrestling capacity that is for sure 




 Naturally... don't be a Debbie Downer and spoil it for her lol 




 Damien Sandow (Macho Mandow) -- He has defeated a former WWE Champion. 




 Not until Lesnar is gone.  That is 98% of his repertoire.  




 If WWECW was still around on Sci-Fi.  He would team up with the Zombie and Kevin Thorn.  Managed by the Yeh-tay 




 the Brainbustaaaaaaaaaaah - Generico

Five Star Frog Splash - RVD

Anything Jack Swagger does because I don't want to get injured 




 Same could be said about Vince McMahon who is the CEO of the company or HHH who is the COO. 









 for whatever reason

Believe me there are plenty of reasons. 




 So my question is this, how can we make WWE aware of this and put an end to it?


It won't stop.  Just don't read something that says Spoilers.  Simple enough 




 Although how can that be given WWE said Kane was out with a broken ankle? 




 They start up a stove burner company.
The Brothers of Induction.
