 If you can get it to the table a lot and you have the right group for it, **Sheriff of Nottingham** is a lot of fun and great value. But you *need* the right group for this. It's very dependent on people willing to play loose, get into the theme etc. It falls very flat if you don't.


For pure gaming, absolutely get **Castles of Burgundy**. It scales magnificently from 2-4, has tons of replay value and is loads of fun. Has some luck with the dice rolls but you can mitigate that with knowledge tiles and worker guys. I love the tactical feel at 2P of blocking your opponent and the more strategic feel at 4P of focusing/maximizing your own strategy first and foremost. All time classic. 
 









 Every sentence just seems so drawn out   unnecessarily convoluted; like it was written to appear as lofty as possible. I read my fair share of literary fiction, but this is a pain to get through and I feel like it greatly distracts from the narrative. 




 I'll be your friend.  




 [My comment reply above](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/3e28tk/can_you_convince_me_to_buy_your_favourite_board/ctaxfsk).

Also, I paid $25 for the expansion. It's $35 now n Amazon. That's not ridiculous at all.

 It's a must buy. The new races are unique and totally offer a new experience for the game. You can play with just them, you can mix it up with the base races, play on either board. But the way the new races play just offers such a new experience. I think they're so brilliantly put together. If you like TM, even if it only gets to the table a couple times a year, it's a must-have. 




 If you don't buy **Terra Mystica** (and the Fire   Ice Expansion) I will punch you right in the mouth.  




 This. God forbid there's an attractive female anywhere near you while attempting to order a drink. You will wait. Forever.

 Well that was a question about board games to play in the car. OP here specifically said "Not boardgames" 




 Where else would you ask about not board games? [AskReddit Seems to Have Been a Good Place for This](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2mveq3/whats_a_good_game_to_play_on_the_road_that_isnt_i/).

 Blaine is a pain 




 1. If you want to climb up your grammar and English language pedestal, learn how to spell and use proper grammar. 

2. You are correct, being an asshole and reading have nothing to do with each other. However, as I initially said, it's fairly obvious what OP was trying to say, without going out of your way to be a dick and take the sentence as literally as possible using his poor grammar. 

3. Even with OP's poor title, there is absolutely nothing that would imply causation of Shaggy being Arab-American "BECAUSE" the guy who voiced him was Arab-American. Literally nothing. 

4. Again, sorry for "you" education.  




 So $23.40 basically. That's half the price that it normally is. I don't know much about this game. Must buy at this price? 




 Unless you can finish reading the sentence and aren't an asshole.  




  When I'm board I like to paint Wood grain.

You missed a golden opportunity there, OP.  




 I don't think you know what a sphere is. 




 That's what OP was referring to: Casey Kasem being of Arab descent, not Shaggy. Poorly worded title, but still, it's not hard to glean the meaning.

 You can buy a Lane Bryant gift card at a discount. Then you can trade that to someone's mom for cash at a big discount. Then use that cash to put towards board games! I found the board games, everyone! 




 This is the correct answer. These things are a godsend. Setting up Le Havre? Keep each good in a container and plop them down in their places on the board. Same for Agricola and Caverna (damn you and all your pieces, Uwe!). Love these.  




 [Here's a list](https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/186405/best-solosolitaire-games-bgg-2015-edition], but I'm guessing you've seen that as you named the top 3 on it. I also enjoy playing Agricola solo, although the set up isn't the quickest.  




 Option A: Spite them and keep winning

Option B: Intentionally lose for awhile to lull them into a false sense of security. Then continue domination at your leisure.

 I asked my SO if she wanted to play a couple of my unplayed games before my new ones arrive in August and she just laughed at me :( 




 Not directly, no. Tactics cards don't count for anything until they're actually put into play.  




 If a flag is (correctly) claimed, it cannot be unclaimed later because a tactics card would allow a wild or extend it 4 cards needed instead of 3. If the flag is claimed, it's claimed for good. Which is the reason for the "advanced" rule it offers in the instructions, that a player cannot claim a flag until the start of their following turn, so to allow a player to stop a flag from being claimed via a tactics card. 


source: I asked this same question awhile ago here :) enjoy the game, it's great! 




 **Abyss** has absolutely gorgeous artwork. 

**Tokaido** is a very clean, attractive looking game.  

**Evolution** has beautiful, watercolor style art. 

In **Fresco**, you play as a master painter and it's a very good looking game. 

**Pictomania** is a pictionary-esque game so it's drawing based with a little bit more going on. Lots of fun.

 I thought Doerr's writing was some of the richest and beautiful prose I've come across. His descriptions of geographical settings, or especially the feelings/emotions/thoughts of his characters were astounding. I loved the long, detailed, textured, rich descriptions amid the quick, staccato chapters and asymmetrical timeline. The immensity for which I ended up caring about all these characters, whether minor or major left me not wanting the book to be over. Can't say enough good things about this novel.  




 Oh yea. I wrote above that our group's first game was Settlers. Then we got into Puerto Rico. Played both of those a ton as we got into the hobby. Settlers doesn't come out anymore, but Puerto Rico does from time to time. Love it.  




 Yep. One thing I liked too is that you can basically pick how long you want the game to be. You can start with a ton of money or very little money if you want a longer or quicker game.  




 It's fun. I have to play it more to give a better opinion. It was a newer purchase as well so I've only had a chance to play 2P once. So there's always that first play stumbling. But I enjoyed it a lot. I think it'll play better with 3 or 4 people.  




 Ha, I guess our mutual acquisition disorders unite us. We have steady group of 5. One guy doesn't really buy any games, another has a handful, and then the other 3 of us are the main collectors. Rounds the collection out nicely as our tastes reflect our collections. I think we have only have a few games that overlap.  




 In my gaming group, my one friend has a collection twice the size of this and another is close behind me. They have Glory to Rome and Innovation. Enjoy them both! 




 I've definitely had my eye on Roll for the Galaxy and La Granja. I'll take a closer look at Elysium and Marco Polo. I've had a bunch of recent acquisitions and the kickstarters coming soon, so I'll add them to my holiday wish list...if my acquisition disorder can hold out that long :) 




 I like Dead of Winter. My collection was almost all heavier euros, so I've been trying to round it out a bit to have something for all occasions, and getting some lighter games when the brain burn gets high. Which is why 1775 is so high on my favorites. It's definitely not Twilight Struggle. You're moving armies around the board and it's a ton of direct conflict with some dice roll (which is done in a really neat way). The 2v2 (you can also play 1v1 with each person controlling both armies on a side) aspect creates a great environment for the game. I love it. It's on the lighter side, it's not terribly long at all but it has great replay-value and a good amount of strategy and decision making. It's just fun.

I had gotten into the hobby 4-5 years ago when my friend picked up Catan, and we played that to death over the next year. Then he found Puerto Rico and that opened the floodgates for our group. A couple years ago I picked up Dominion Intrigue and Agricola to start my collection. It's grown and grown from there.

Five Tribes   Core Worlds are new purchases so I haven't gotten them to the table yet. And I already know I'll have to get at least one Core Worlds expansion. Brass was a January purchase but still hasn't made it to the table unfortunately. I have the Evolution + expansion   Mottanai Kickstarters coming in August (hopefully) so I'll have to get those played before the new ones come in. Fortune   Glory I just hate. Maybe it'd be more fun if I gave it more of a chance but there's just too much going on for me to make it fun for what it is.

 There are a ton. Toronto easily has the most of any city. Just google it.  




 The link to the sale was posted here a couple weeks ago. I just got the package and the seller said there was a mix-up with the product codes, and they're issuing a refund. I would like Civilization though. Especially at that sale price.

A spoon from the kitchen? Leader gets the spoon now.

That bobblehead you got at a minor league baseball game? Goes to the leader.

Some lint from your belly button? That's caveman lint now. Goes to first player.


That blu-ray copy of Alec Baldwin   Sarah-Michelle Gellar's Suburban Girl that you got at a white elephant party? First player is now the suburban cavegirl. 


Hopefully this helps.  




 Tenacity? In the entire NHL, only Stamkos, Perry, Kane, Nash, Toews and Ovechkin have scored more 5v5 goals than Kessel since the 2010-2011 season. In that group he also has more 5v5 assists than Ovechkin, Nash, Perry and Stamkos.

 I know this game gets a ton of love here, but it just falls flat with me. I bought it while aboard the hype train after its initial release, and have played it about 10 times since. The first couple plays were fun, but then it just never progressed. My biggest issue is that I never get a real sense of completion. The castles seem small at the end, and there tends to be AP by the master-builder which stagnates the game at times. Each play, I'm just underwhelmed after.  




 You described **Eclipse**. Save for a little bit more and buy Eclipse. 


Star Realms plays just like Ascension basically. You're not building anything. Just laying cards out. If you have to pick between Star Realms and Race For the Galaxy, it's RFTG every day of the week. Star Realms isn't on Race's level at all.  




 Bummed that Xia: Legends of a Drift System got shut out. That game is freaking awesome.  




 Please rearrange the top shelf so Terra Mystica Fire   Ice and Sherlock Holmes aren't in between much wider boxes. It's making me uncomfortable.

 I own **Five Tribes** and my best friend has **Istanbul** and **Concordia**. I would say, hands down, Concordia. It plays wonderfully with all player counts, the replay-value is tremendous with the randomized goods tiles, card order and now with the various boards. I love it.

 In my lifetime I was roughly 0-6375463549 in playing Carcassonne against my friend John. Each game, played out like the last: my meeples scattered in unfinished castles, starving along roads to nowhere, slaughtered in fields outnumbered two to one. I'd watch his scoring marker danced along the track, circling and circling the board. Adding expansions only made the misery more prolonged, more insufferable. 


Yet I persevered. Then one day (oh this glorious day!), did the tiles fall into my favor. Square by square, I completed majestic, shielded castles. I built long, windy roads that had a beginning and end. I frolicked in the fields my opponent dared not enter. And I won. By the angels in heaven and the hammer of Thor, I won. 


With my new found confidence and Carcassonne prowess, we reset the battle field so I could take back to back victories. 


And I got killed.


But I will always have that one. That sweet, sweet one. Damn you, John.

 This was the first Neil Gaiman book I'd ever read and I finished it in a day. I couldn't put it down. Loved it. The world he painted in this was so magical and rich and vibrant, you could feel it. 




 One of my favorite openers as well. From the first sentence you just know something is off about this world and are hooked. 




 Ha. Cloud Atlas was one of the books I knew I'd hate after the first page. I always finish the book I'm reading. I don't give up on the book, I just can't leave them unfinished...unless the book is Cloud Atlas 




 I've had this book on my shelf for probably 2 years now and haven't opened it up. Maybe I'll finally have to this summer. 




 Pinochle all night.  




 What drew you in about the book? Something with the character or a specific quote? The language and/or the prose? How did it go from there...were you disappointed at the end or did you still love it? 









 Playing battle line my friend took a flag with 345 straight flush. The cards played out meant I couldn't take this flag at all so he claimed it. However, later a tactics card came into my hand that gave me a wild 8 of any suit which gave me the ability for a better straight flush. Can I still play here and take the flag back or is it dead?  




 This looks very similar to Wits   Wagers. If this is a retheme of Fauna, can people familiar with Fauna shed some light on the differences between that and Wits   Wagers? 




 and if you run out of space, you can put the stuff from the shoeboxes into the empty game boxes.

 First...I own Domion Intrigue along with Hinterlands, Dark Ages, Guilds and the rest of my group has the base, Seaside, Prosperity. I've played it a ton. Don't let some of the poor artwork blow the game for you. And to the theme nuts out there...who the hell cares. It's a game where you use the 10 kingdom cards available to get the most VP's. And it works beautifully. With the wealth of expansions (and cards in each expansion) the breadth of replay value is, perhaps, unmatched. It's an easy game to learn, and one that also has a lot of depth and strategy (see www.dominionstrategy.com for that). Dominion has reached the status it has because it is great.


Secondly, I also own **Eminent Domain**, **Core Worlds**, **Trains** and **Star Realms**. I guess I like deck builders. Dominion will always be my favorite, but I love the mechanics of Eminent Domain and Core Worlds. They each offer unique experience (Eminent Domain with role sections and followers, Core Worlds with invasion types, worlds, etc). You can't go wrong. The only downside to Core Worlds is that you really need the expansion(s) to make it a complete game so it turns into a $60 game. If theme is important for you, which it seems to be, Core Worlds offers, in my opinion, the best theme of any deck builder. 

Trains works well with theme as well with the enhanced mechanic of an actual board and pieces. It's pretty much Dominion with a board. You feel more of an experience like you're building a train line (even if it just little cubes). 

Star Realms is fun for up to 5-10 plays. 

DC deck builder is terrible.

 In the game you're trying to figure out which potions combine to create spells. The app randomizes this so each game is different. So you use the app to take a picture of two ingredient cards and it tells you what it becomes.  




 **Alchemists** uses an app as a core mechanic in the game.  




 **Alchemists** is a pretty heavy game. There's a lot going on there and the teaching/learning time is *steep*. It's a really great game, but if you're wary about dropping some heavy on your friends, you might want to wait on that. **Ca$h 'n Gun$** and **Mascarade** aren't really competitive. They're more just social party games and Mascarade offers some deduction elements. 


**Battlestar Galactica** plays well with 5P if you want to go the co-op/traitor route. Take a look at **Power Grid** for a classic medium weight that plays well at 5.  **Kemet** is a medium-light game that works great at 3-5. It's quick, action packed war game and not too hard to get into at all. You can even combine it with **Cyclades** which is super cool. And there's always **Cosmic Encounter** for a crazy good time.

 reference sheet on back cover of rule book is great tho. Makes it real easy to glance at what card icons mean. First playthrough is definitely a lot of just learning the cards and seeing how they play out.  




 **Last Will** is a great game. Just have to get your mind working towards $0. It's a pretty simple game at it's core. Each round you pick turn order   week's plan, send out a couple workers to the board, play action cards in your hand. That's it. The real decisions is really in the planning board, making sure you give yourself enough cards or actions that you need that round.

 House Rule #1: Don't House Rule Games.  




 I haven't played **1812**, so I can't say for sure. I can say that 1775 has a higher rating on BGG, and watching Tom Vasel's [review on 1775: Rebellion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIxBHGyMXzE) he says it's superior to 1812. 

Here are also a couple of links comparing [the](http://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/2jzrfl/wsig_1812_the_invasion_of_canada_or_1775_rebellion/) [two](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/923364/comparing-1775-1812). 




 Check out **1775: Rebellion**. Lighter war game, lots of fun. Very historical, tactical, some card drafting (you have 12 cards, 3 in hand at a time), moving soldiers around Colonial US   Canada. Lots of fun. A bit lighter than your traditional war game. I think the 2 v 2 aspect is a fantastic option as well you don't see often.

 if she had 5, then she was either holding more than more than 3 cards in her hand or she was stockpiling all of them on purpose (which would take at least 9 turns, and likely more) at the sacrifice of only having   using 5 regular gems, which doesn't seem an efficient use of gems. All the meanwhile, you would be left with full reign over the regular gems. 
 




 News show with only positive, uplifting news.  




 Well, it would take awhile. You can only hold 3 cards at a time. And you can only get one wild at a time. Theoretically, a person could get 3 wild gems and then play one of their cards-in-hand with all regular gems, while holding their wilds, but that'd be hard to do. And not remotely efficient. While they're taking 1 wild at a time and not playing any cards, everyone else is getting 2-3 gems turn and/or buying cards 




 You can take 1 wild token when you stash a card into your hand. You can't have more than 10 total tokens in front of you at any given time.  There are no limits on *holding* a certain color token as long as your total is 10 or under 




 Can't tell if there was just a ton of effort put into a joke there, or there was no joke at all...

 Hey, don't beat yourself up. It was a good hour of hearing about games I've never heard of that no one will want to play :) 




 During clan wars, I've been using a hog attack strategy that seems to be pretty hit   miss lately. It's especially miss if there are inferno towers. I use 38 hog riders (max), 10 barbarians (max) and 25 archers (max). 


I typically send the hogs in at the same side side of the base, but slightly apart to form 2 close by fronts. For spells, I drop 4 heal spells for them throughout the attack. 


I run into issues if 1. there are inferno towers, they destroy the hogs. or 2. I get unlucky and hit a lot of traps. If the base also has a good amount of upgraded wizard towers or archers, that gives them problems. 


What could I do to tweak this attack to make it a little more viable and consistent? Thanks.  




 Ah, the ever motivational Gilfoyle.  




 No, still follow the rule. It adds a little strategy of blocking your opponent from grabbing 2 fairly easier. You'll still be able to grab 2 if you really need (I'd still advice grabbing 3 two turns in a row) fairly regularly as you or your opponent returns gems to the stack 









 Yep. Brain fart. Thanks for pointing that out 




 Is that as huge as it looks?
