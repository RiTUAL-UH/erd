 People need to seriously chill out with this nonsense. It was wrong for the biker to steal and damage someone's property. People keep stealing and attacking people who have different opinions expecting the other person to not defend themselves and their property.  




 I have been pulled over for that myself and I'm white. I had to pay the fine.  




  Samuel Dubose, a 43-year-old father of 13 children, according to CNN affiliate WKRC-TV. A CNN records search showed that Dubose had more than 60 arrests.

Wow, what a quality fellow with 60 arrests. My next question is how the hell does he afford to have 13 children with an arrest record like that?! No one would hire him. Who was paying for these children? I hope he wasn't forcing other people to pay for his inability to control his dick or wear a condom.  
























 SJWs in a nutshell.
