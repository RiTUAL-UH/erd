 The neutrinos travel at the speed of light, they just don't interact very much with normal nature. So when the star goes super nova, the neutrinos are able to radiate out basically unimpeded. The photons released have to travel through the star's matter before they get to surface and this slows them down. That's why we see neutrinos before anything else.

 Actually I think you're right now that you mentioned Cobol. Was thinking about the wrong antiqued language. Oops 




 I think a lot of the major banking website's databases were coded in FORTRAN or some other equally antiquated language.

Seriously if you use Wells Fargo, go try to long on with random capitalization of your password. It is fucking ridiculous. 




 With 3+ sexes it would much harder to find compatible mates consistently and especially in times of hardship I imagine. The cost would likely outweigh the benefit of the increased genetic fitness in the species. It would basically follow the law of diminishing returns, the benefits of the transition from asexual reproduction to two sexes would be significantly more than going from 2 sexes to 3. 




 Can confirm. I have a degree in biomedical engineering and did undergraduate research in bioinformatics. I was able to get a job doing software development at Illumina, my absolute dream company and my top choice out of the 50+ companies I applied to. I'm incredibly happy to have the chance to work at the company whose name is basically synonymous with next generation sequencing and would not change a thing if I could go back to when I just started college. I'm thoroughly convinced that the biological revolution will be the next digital revolution and am excited to see what amazing changes happen in this field in the next fee decades. 









 Thanks! I will definitely check it out, I've been looking for another good historical podcast after listening to and being fascinated by all of Hardcore History. 




 Great post, thanks. Can you comment on the historical accuracy of the HBO series Rome? Based on this post and what I have read about Roman history on Wikipedia it seems incredibly accurate, including almost all of the major historical points mentioned above present. 




 I'm not an expert but this seems correct to me. It is probably even more ideal for the hormone secretion to be spread out around the body in this case. I would imagine that the implanted ovary fragments do not produce as much of the necessary hormones as a natural ovary but spreading out the fragments would help to mitigate this issue. Also with 11 fragments throughout the body if one fails to take, it will not significantly effect the overall procedure. The procedure would be more likely to fail if the entire ovary was grafted into a single location.

 Great thanks! This is actually the original article I mentioned it will definitely be helpful to give it a read again. 









 Ah OK, looks like I was remembering these multiple issues as one single issue with just one of the rovers. Thanks for clarifying! I'm sure the engineering team designing the wheels knew damage of this sort would be a possibility but I am guessing they either did not correctly estimate the likelihood of holes of this size appearing on the wheels or they missed some variable in the prototype design. Do you know what the weak point of the wheel is and if the engineers knew about it prior to launch and just decided it was an acceptable design limitation? Or were they kind of taken by surprise by the environment and stresses encountered on Mars? 




 I remember reading a very in depth and interesting article on the issues that have arose with the wheels of one of the rovers(not 100% sure which it was). Basically the back left wheel has accrued over the years pretty sizeable hole so NASA actually begun to only drive the rover backwards to limit the risk of allowing the hole to continue to get bigger and eventually to cripple the poor rover. I always assumed this meant some NASA scientist had to manually drive the rover backwards but I guess it does make more sense to just change the programming. Although I'm not sure this is the case because the sensors are obviously designed for sensing forward not backward. Do you happen to know if in this special case the rover is still moved autonomously? 




 But is it really? Don't you see something(maybe the cup the detective is drinking from) with the name Kobayashi on it implying Verbal just made it up. Isn't that the case for pretty much everything in the movie?

In the big picture though this is not really relevant I guess. 




 Don't forget the limp disappearing and him getting into the car with the lawyer(can't remember his name). If you watch the movie a second time around, there is a scene while Verbal is being interrogated where you can actually see him smile while he and the cop are talking about Kaiser Sose but the cop(also can't remember his name!) is behind him and can't see his face. Great movie. Great actor. 




 One of the biggest qualms I have with Christianity is that it is so unchristian to have someone go to hell based on where and when they are born. Human sacrifice was part of the religion of the Aztecs(or Mayan or both?) as well as I'm sure, many other cultures. Many people born in these times and places didn't really choose to be complacent with or actively participate in murder. They were born into a culture where it was an inexorable part of their religion. They couldn't have repented because it wasn't wrong for them. Yet according to the bible, although it is fairly ambiguous and up to interpretation, it is very likely they would go to hell for these kind of acts. How is that Christian? 




 Exactly IE a "confidential informant" never revealed to the court for privacy reasons or some other bullshit.

 During its descent into a black hole, an object will pick up a substantial amount of velocity due to the gravitation pull and this will be added to its original velocity before acted on by the black hole. I'm assuming that eventually after it merges with the black hole, the object will be brought a halt relative to the black hole. Where does the kinetic energy of the object go? Will the black hole accelerate in the direction of the collision due to the impact, if you can call it that? Is the black hole just too massive for this impact to have any substantial effect? It seems to me like the object would be accelerated to very high speed because of the intense gravitational pull. Due to the random distribution of objects entering the black hole, do the effects on the velocity of the black hole just cancel out because they occur in all directions? 




 Kind of related question, where does the kinetic energy of the mass being sucked into the black hole go? I assume when an object enters a black hole it stops moving so shouldn't the kinetic energy from its velocity just before impact be transferred to the black hole? Let's say an object the size of a star collides directly with the black hole, when the objects collide will be the black hole gain the momentum of the star and be pushed in the direction of the collision? Is the black hole just too massive for this to have any substantial effect? 









 Yes they literally charge your property. You even end up with an absurd case name like:

It's comically absurd I couldn't make this shit up. 




 Found the answer to my own question actually. In case anyone else is wondering. In a litre of freshwater the oxygen content is 8 cm^3 per litre compared to 210 in the same volume of air.  A person breathes 7 or 8 liters of air per minute. Air is about 20% oxygen. But when you exhale, your breath is about 15% oxygen, so you consumed about 5%. Therefore, a person uses about 550 liters of pure oxygen each day.

So air has 26.25x as much oxygen as the same volume of water. That means a human would have to breathe 183.75-210 liters of water per minute which is ~12600 liters per hour and ~302400 liters per day. This is of course assuming the same oxygen diffusing rate in water as air. Oxygen actually has a diffusion rate in air 10,000 times greater than in water. This means you'd have to breathe about 2,100,000 liters of air a minute to get the same amount of oxygen. Damn fish have it pretty tough.

 Yeah the way next gen sequencing works is you barcode each sample(in this case a genome) by adding a specific sequence of 4-8 nucleotides to the ends of the DNA fragments of that sample. By doing this you can sequence up to 96 samples simultaneously, all mixed together and sequenced at the same time. After gathering all the sequencing data, you simply use those barcode sequences(which will always be at the ends of the DNA fragments) to differentiate between the samples. 

The barcodes often have to be specifically designed based on the genome you are sequencing and choosing and adding these barcodes to the DNA fragments is a major part of library prep. Also before adding these barcodes you break up the DNA strands(millions or billions of nucleotides) into much shorter fragments(usually 400-800 nucleotides). 

During library prep, you have to copy the original strand of DNA many times and break it up at different points to ensure you get fragments that overlap. In the sequencing process you need these overlapping fragments to determine the where in the overall genome that specific fragment is. A lot of times in order to get a sequencing accuracy of 1 error in 1000 nucleotides(pretty good for most applications), each nucleotide will have a coverage of at least 30x meaning 30 of those fragments overlap on that specific nucleotide. 




 This is awesome, any chance you could link to one of these higher resolution photos? Can't seem to find anything on google.  




 Once the library(the reagents the machine will use to do the synthesis) is prepared it would take an hour to a couple hours of labor.

 Working mirror(with part 2 also!): http://documentaryheaven.com/louis-theroux-by-reason-of-insanity/ 




 I think I wasn't really clear in my explanation. There is a lot of labor involved, but not as much as you might think. Setting everything up is the hard part, Library prep is more labor intensive than actual sequencing. In fact with everything set up, getting the sequences of bases requires minimal user input and is almost completely automated. You do need a trained professional to be able to carry out these sequencing processes, but it isn't that far removed from standard lab protocols every biologist learns in school.

What is costly for next gen sequencing is the limited sequencing resources; IE these are really damn expensive devices, you can only sequence a limited number of samples for a given time and increased accuracy of the sequencing data means a longer sequencing process. I hope that makes sense , I'm sorry I feel like I'm having trouble explaining all this because it really is very esoteric. [Check out this PDF for more in-depth information](http://www.illumina.com/content/dam/illumina-marketing/documents/products/illumina_sequencing_introduction.pdf) 




 This is really hard to say. Right now the bioinformatics and computational genomics fields have way more information than we know what to do with. Gathering sequencing data is currently much more straight forward than analyzing it.

 For example I'll use E. coli, a prokaryote with a "simple" genome which is orders of magnitude shorter than a human genome. E coli is by far the most studied prokaryotic genome and yet we are still struggling to perfect something as seemingly easy as accurate gene prediction. The head researcher of one research team I worked on, a brilliant man and a pioneer in the field of genetics who currently does computational genomics work for the CDC tracking the spread and and evolution of various diseases, told me once he thinks we only have about 80% of E. Coli's genes mapped correctly. I'm not talking about gene function or anything complicated like that, I'm talking about literally just where the genes start and the genes end.This is a simple genome and the one we probably know the most about. It's an organism for which ethics are not a restraint if you will, we can starve E. Coli bacteria or subject them to various environmental stressors without any moral qualms. Studying E. Coli is much more conducive to the scientific process than studying humans and yet we still know so little about it. But I digress, I'm sure in the future we will unlock these enigmatic secrets of DNA and life that we don't understand right now. I'm sure we will be eventually able to take someone's DNA and accurately figure out their facial structure. Whether it will be in 5 years or in 50 I can't say. 




 I think you are correct, genetic phenotyping is very much a field in it's infancy. [Here's a great article in The New York Times that paints, in my opinion, an accurate portriant of the current state of the field.](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/24/science/building-face-and-a-case-on-dna.html?_r=0) 




 The $1000 genome sequencing is possible with a device made by Illumina called the HiSeqX. This sequencing platform consists of 10 of Illumina's HiSeq devices, each of which costs somewhere around a couple million dollars. Illumina is basically the Microsoft of the genetic industry and the vast majority of all sequencing is done using their platforms.

The $1000 cost comes from the reagents and other materials that it takes to do what is called library prep. This consists of preparing oligos, short 4-8 nucleotide sequences that are used as barcodes to identify various DNA samples during the sequencing process. PCR is used to amplify the regions of interest and total quantity of DNA and there are a whole bunch of other steps to genome sequencing that are much too complicated to explain here. 




 I'll start with me, I work in the field of genetics. Genome sequencing capabilities are currently exceeding Moore's law. Just this year we got to a point where it only costs $1000 and a day or two to sequence a human genome. The human genome project(1990-2003) took 10 years to gather the data, 3 years to analyze it and cost $3 billion.

We can do crazy things now like genetic phenotyping where facial structure can be roughly (and somewhat rudimentarily) approximated from someone's DNA. This has applications in forensics cases. Fetal genome sequencing is becoming possible and personalized medicine and cancer treatment is no longer just for the extremely wealthy. We are without a doubt watching a biological revolution unfold before our eyes that will change the world just as much as the digital/information revolution has.

Note: I feel obligated to mention the $1000 dollar genome is sequenced with a machine costing tens of millions of dollars right now though.

 He claims kevlar and microprocessors were developed with the help of aliens or their technology. These developments are incredibly well documented for both microprocessors[1] and kevlar[2] .

 How would the access to patient data work? Would it be proprietary where researchers can only access data on specific diseases they are studying or would it be entirely open for the scientific community or the entire public or would it be somewhere in between? Who would be responsible for creating, maintaining and paying for such a database?

How would an open access database of cancer patient genomes(for example) ensure that all HIPAA standards for patient privacy and anonymity are met? It seems to me that even if a patient name is not linked to the data, a sequenced genome or partially sequenced genome is something that is incredibly patient specific and personal, possibly to the point of offering patient identification or threatening the patient's health information privacy. Has this come up as an issue at all? I'm not all that well versed in HIPAA compliance so I may be completely wrong about this.

Have you met any resistance from the medical or scientific community with regards to an open access data such as this? If so what were the reasons?

 First of all I understand that exactly I'm not stupid nor scientifically illiterate. Your original comment was incredibly misleading and completely took the first sentence of the abstract out of context. But I guess I'll have to take your word for it, I've got a degree in biomedical engineering not geochemistry.  




 I thought only men wear kilts and if a woman is wearing it it is a skirt? Correct me if I'm wrong.^^^Pretty ^^^pedantic, ^^^I ^^^know 




 Ok well nothing in science is definitive. We can't go back in time to the Permian extinction and see exactly what happens. What we can do is extrapolate based on geological data and the like. This study makes the claim that direct evidence for the contribution of ocean acidification to this mass extinction up until this point was lacking. The authors then go on to claim they have been able to extrapolate the ocean pH during this period via isotope data and quantitative modeling and thus provide more definitive evidence. The substantial increase in the acidity of the ocean coincides with a "rapid and large injection of carbon" into the atmosphere which in turn coincides with geological records of marine fauna dying off. 

The title is  pretty much just a summary of the study and really has minimal sensationalism. I don't understand what you're getting at or your argument at all. 




 The same person who Citizen Kane was basically about by the way. 




 This is exactly what I thought as well and I've got a degree in biomedical engineering and am fairly scientifically literate. The irony in that comment is almost palpable.  




 The next sentence in the abstract is 
We present a high-resolution seawater pH record across this interval, using boron isotope data combined with a quantitative modeling approach.

In other words, the evidence for this event was lacking, here's some more evidence. This makes me think /u/so_I_says_to_mabel literally stopped reading after that first sentence. The is irony is palpable.

 Collision is a bit of a misnomer in regards to what is going to occur between the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxies. I think merging is a more apt term, yes the galaxies are headed toward each other and will meet but the vast distances between stars means it is highly improbable that many stars or planetary systems will actually collide. This is especially the case for stars like ours that are towards the outer rim of the galaxies. 

Instead the two galaxies and the majority of their stars will merge into a single galaxy. Some stars will be ejected into intergalactic space in the process but these are by far the minority. Chances are the life will be relatively unaffected by this event. 

In terms of your first point, I think large and self sustaining spacecraft would mitigate the issue. Imagine a ship intended for generational interstellar travel with tens or hundreds of thousands of inhabitants. You set out and maybe your grandchildren reach the your destination. Relativity also means the faster you are traveling, the father you can go in, from your POV, a shorter amount of time. Maybe 100 years pass for inhabitants of the ship, while 1000 years pass for the rest of the galaxy. Would humans be willing to embark on such a voyage? Would they finally reach their destination only to find others already there due to some technological advance while they were travelling? I don't know but to me colonizing the galaxy or just other nearby stars seems possible at the very least.

 Awesome answer, thank you. Hopefully I get to see something like this in my lifetime. Do you think this is feasible in the next couple decades? 

Another question, we can determine the chemical composition of the planet's atmosphere with less resolution than a 30x30 picture right? What does that require? I think I remember hearing finding a significant amount of atmospheric oxygen is very strong evidence for life because that wouldn't happen inorganically. Is that right? 




 If a large enough telescope existed would it be possible to see an earth-like planet like [Gliese 667 Cc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gliese_667_Cc) or [Kepler-438b](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler-438b) in the visible spectrum in any kind of meaningful resolution?  Let's assume perfect viewing conditions IE maximum illumination of the planet relative to earth, correct plane, etc. and also that exposure time isn't a constraint. At distances like that, are there photons reflecting off the planet that even make it to earth or is it too far? How big would a telescope have to be to be able to make out an earthlike planet at the distance of 23.6 or 470 lightyears?  How far does something the size of a planet have to be before the probability of encountering a reflected photon with a large telescope is negligible?

 Can't we actually thank Robert S. McNamara for that? He was the CEO of Ford when they implemented the seat belt. According to the the documentary The Fog of War, he is almost directly responsible for the seat belt. 

By the way, watch that documentary if you haven't seen it already. McNamara was the secretary of defense for a major portion of the Vietnam War. He served under Kennedy and was fired/quit partially through LBJ's administration. The Academy Award-winning documentary, augmented by archival footage, gives the conflicted McNamara a platform on which he attempts to confront his and the U.S. government's actions in Southeast Asia in light of the horrors of modern warfare, the end of ideology and the punitive judgment of history.
 




 Nope, inertia is why going from 100 to 0 mph in 2 seconds puts so much stress on your body(and the car). All that kinetic energy has to go somewhere so there is a massive force exerted on the car and anything in the car(you). It's the correct term in this case. 




 I live in Austin too and actually work at Chuys right now. Hopefully you know what that is, if not find the nearest one and go there immediately, it is the best tex-mex you'll ever have. Anyways the amount of morbidly obese that come in daily disturbs me, I serve multiple people each day that can't even be seated at booths because they simply won't fit. Our food is definitely not healthy and I watch them eat easily 4000 calories in a single meal. I can't help but feel I'm enabling them and it's kind of a moral dilemma for me. I really don't like watching and even helping people to shorten their lifespan 10, 20, 30 years. 

 I've always been skinny myself (6' and 155 lbs) and I'm lucky in that respect because I don't work out or really make an active effort to eat healthy. I just don't understand how people can let it get to the point of morbid obesity and don't think I ever will. I try not to judge people for it but its hard.

 Yeah, I don't understand the notion that even if life did exist on Titan we wouldn't be able to tell it is life. Just go to Titan and take a look at some methane under a microscope. Going one step further, filter out everything above a certain size(the size of a methane molecule maybe) and study that. If there is life I'm sure it will be significant larger than inorganic molecules regardless of if it is aqueous or not. 




 You don't have to know exactly what chemicals to look for necessarily. Just look for something out of the ordinary, something that shouldn't be there if the world is inorganic. 

Example: Possible evidence for this form of life on Titan was identified in 2010 by Darrell Strobel of Johns Hopkins University; a greater abundance of molecular hydrogen in the upper atmospheric layers of Titan compared to the lower layers, arguing for a downward diffusion at a rate of roughly 10^25 molecules per second and disappearance of hydrogen near Titan's surface. As Strobel noted, his findings were in line with the effects Chris McKay had predicted if methanogenic life-forms were present. The same year, another study showed low levels of acetylene on Titan's surface, which were interpreted by Chris McKay as consistent with the hypothesis of organisms reducing acetylene to methane. While restating the biological hypothesis, McKay cautioned that other explanations for the hydrogen and acetylene findings are to be considered more likely: the possibilities of yet unidentified physical or chemical processes (e.g. a non-living surface catalyst enabling acetylene to react with hydrogen), or flaws in the current models of material flow.

 This is really not all that different from bioluminescence, both are electromagneticradiation and differ only in wavelength. I'd imagine it is possible but would be surprised to see it happen. Remember evolution has no foresight, nature isn't going to start producing radio waves randomly, there has to be a benefit to it.and it has to develop gradually. What would be the point of an animal producing EM radiation at a wavelength imperceptible to every other creature? A method of producing radio waves and an organ which could perceive it would have to develop concurrently. 




 DNA is a highly polar molecule, which has evolved over millions of years to be stable and functional in aqueous solution. Some organic solvents (methanol, formamide, pyridine, or dimethyl sulfoxide) induce unfolding and strand separation, or formation of toroid-like conformations,while others, such as glycerol or room-temperature ionic liquids, maintain the duplex structure. In one computational simulation of DNA in CCl4(fairly similar to methane at least in terms of polarity) the DNA becomes stiffer and the landscape is more frustrated in the apolar phases, meaning a presence of significant energy barriers for biological process. Compact states (likely fairly similar to the aqueous states of DNA) were observed if the DNA was neutralized, while more extended conformations are expected if the DNA maintains its ionic state in water.

[Source](http://mmb.pcb.ub.es/~gportella/pdf/Arcella_jpcb_2014.pdf)

In simpler terms, we don't really know because it very hard to study DNA in apolar solutions. Theoretical models seem to point towards biological processes being at least somewhat inhibited but nothing is conclusive. I would imagine the chemical structure of the methane-DNA equivalent would be moderately to significantly different from what we see with aqueous solutions.
