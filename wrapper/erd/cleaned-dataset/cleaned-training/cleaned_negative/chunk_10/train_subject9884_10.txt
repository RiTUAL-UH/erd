 I will try to keep it short:

We started dating in Jan 2013, she was diagnosed in August 2013 (she cannot be cured, but it is currently under control. Nobody knows for how long though). 
We stayed together until April this year. We had lots of ups and downs. However until now she always managed to pick herself back up. 

I don't want to go into why we broke up because my version of the story is of course biased. In any case, we did not work. By the end of our relationship we argued 24/7. 

She decided that she does not want to talk to me anymore. I did not like that but had to respect her wish. Yesterday she called me and was saying that she can't bear it anymore (the pressure, the emotional pain, being alone). The few friends she has do listen to her, but there is no solution to ease the emotional pain she is in. She keeps saying things that make me believe she might be about to harm herself. Also she has no family she can rely on. 

I want to help her, but I must know what the best way is to deal with depression. How can I make life seem worth living to her? 

Any advice on how to support her would be greatly appreciated. 




 Does nobody mind that the gif cuts out when the plane seems to be falling overhead? 




 I don't mind it at all, because it's just the way you pour your beer. But I bought a German beer the other day in a bowling alley in London and the waitress scraped off the foam. I was very close to screaming at her 









 Ask an English guy if he thinks that is the perfect pour. They fucking hate foam.  




 Indeed 




 Yes, but it feels like it should be more advanced than that... 




 I firmly believe that the concept of duty is bullshit. 

Why does a soldier have to feel a sense of duty? It is a job. He is risking his life so pay him a lot. Don't tell him: Hey look, we can't pay you very well, but it's an honour to fight for your country, so you've got that going for you."

If a worker is supposed to work better, more efficient, etc, increase his compensation. What is wrong with that?  




 When people say: "It doesn't matter what others say: You be who you are."

It is not ok at all not to question yourself every once in a while.  




 Exactly. Cut off both of my arms. Doesn't kill me if I get help, but for sure does not make me stronger.

 Shall I help you out?

 I give you $50 if you cut these 50 onions for me.

 I can't believe water desalination is still difficult (or expensive). Of course I know nothing about it, but here is what I think:

In places where water is scarce, it's normally hot, so boiling water does not require soooooo much energy. I am sure you can build a few of them plants for a few million Dollars and build pipelines.

Who's gonna pay for it? Just ask some rich dudes if they want to be loved by a whole continent for 20% of their money. If I had the money, I would totally give.   




 No problem. I appreciate it. I found a place in Camden. All good.  




 Yes, exactly this kind of thing. But they are in Bath and unfortunately I left it for too long. Her Birthday in tomorrow. Thank you very much anyway.  




 Sweet!
I called them and they have some. Also in my price range.

Thank you very much!!!

 I did not experience any of those apart from app force closures.  




 What is the difference between illegal and highly illegal?

Reminds me of A few good men:

Lt. Weinberg: "I strenuously object?" 

Is that how it works? Hm? 

"Objection."

"Overruled."

"Oh, no, no, no. No, I STRENUOUSLY object."

"Oh. Well, if you strenuously object then I should take some time to reconsider." 




 I wanted to buy one for my friends birthday but forgot. Now her birthday is coming up and for the life of me I can't find an online shop that sells them. They are really really beautiful. 

Any help would be really appreciated.  




 Well, I went through the following procedure because I did it all as it happened. I am sure by now you can skip half the steps

1. http://forum.xda-developers.com/z3-compact/development/stock-firmware-23-0-1-5-77-generic-t3012378

2. Flashed the first available Lollipop rom as soon as it was available pre rooted. I had to reinstall custom recovery though.

3. then I flashed this: http://forum.xda-developers.com/z3-compact/development/d5803-lollipop-5-02-odexed-pre-rooted-2-t3090505. When you do this, make sure to flash the dualrecovery after flashing the rom. Otherwise you lose the custom recovery again. 

I am sure this is nowhere near a good enough step by step guide. But you can find everything you need on XDA.

Edit: This is a good guide. http://forum.xda-developers.com/z3-compact/general/how-to-root-backup-drm-keys-t3013343

Again, something easier might be available by now.  

 




 I just watched the episode in season 4 yesterday where Daniel is kidnapped by an Unas. So it was easy for me to make the connection.  




 I flashed a lollipop rom and I have 0 issues. What are you worried about specifically? 

So far everything is perfect. Xposed works, I've got viper4android working. I'm super happy. 

Well actually I've got two problems:

1. Sometimes apps just force stop. But it's rare and really doesn't bother me. 

2. Very often the screen turns on in my pocket and changes settings, pocketdials, or does something else. But that is not a lollipop issue. That is a it's too hot and me legs are sweaty issue.  




 Does it hold?  




 He ded 




 Is he doing that because they were mean to him yesterday?  




 If you like to feel hope when you know it will be crushed...  




 I thought the i3 comes with one? 




 http://de.pcpartpicker.com/p/rqTRxr

I'm going to install this in my room at my mother's. I am only there every 4 month for the weekend. I just want to be able to browse the internet and play Diablo 3.  




 To be honest, I don't mind that there is chaos for 1 day, I can totally live with that. But I find it unreasonable what they are asking for based on this article.  









 Doesn't change my point though. Thery make it seem like you can look at the DHD and say: Yes, I can see that they went to Chulak. But that is not the case I believe.  




 A Stargate address is a coordinate system used by a Stargate to determine the position of a target gate in the Stargate Network. They are composed of a series of glyphs, at least seven depending on the intended destination, which when entered in the correct order allow the Stargate to establish a wormhole with another gate at the destination.

Here is more info:

http://stargate.wikia.com/wiki/Stargate_address 




 How would it be possible to guess an address by looking at the DHD  of an active Stargate. They do this all the time but I think if you look at the DHD all you get is 7 symbols. Obviously you know which one will be last, since you know which world you are on. But how could you know the order of the other 6 by just looking at the DHD? 




 Sorry, what is good about BB10? 




 I'm saying I have never been to India so I can't judge based on the few Indian women I see where I live.  




 What makes it good?  




 Get to the point man. I'm really interested in your article and the topic. But I don't want to read half a book as introduction.  




 Not sure that answers my question...

Are you tired all the time? 




 Sorry, my explanation was not good. I have all the birthdays saved, but I do not receive reminders from Android.  




 I would like not to add reminders but to simply turn on the "permanent notification on a day that one of my contact has his/her birthday". 

This would be much appreciated.  




 Never seen an Indian woman like that on the street. Where are they hiding?

In India I guess... 




 No Germany? 




 I am speechless.  




 Seriously? I work out 3 times a week 1 hour each time. No wonder you look a lot fitter than me. 

Don't you get tired? 




 Never heard Kings never die. Thanks for that. 

 




 Yep, you're right. But that song is really dark compared to Phenomenal.  




 YES! 8 Mile is what I was thinking of. Thank you! 




 Yep, Rabbit Run is a good one. I also just re-discovered 8 Mile. So good!

And I never heard Above the Law. Really Good.  




 Other than Lose Yourself of course 









 Einem Ordner von Bayer ins Gesicht geschlagen.  




 Ja, ich verstehe was du meinst. Aber er ist ja nicht davongekommen. Er wurde entlassen und gesperrt. Ich glaube auch nicht, dass er jetzt die dicke Kohle beim HSV verdient. Und anstatt Champions League geht es jetzt gegen den Abstieg. Der ist auf jeden Fall nicht davongekommen. 

Zumindest habe ich nicht das Gefuehl. 

Edit: Und ich finde nicht, dass der nie wieder nen Job bekommen sollte. Wie soll man sich denn wieder integrieren, wenn man keine zweite Chance bekommt.  




 Ach ich weiss nicht. War natuerlich nicht korrekt von ihm aber jeder baut mal Mist. 




 nichts. Jeder hasst den HSV sowieso. Alles richtig gemacht.  




 She's German, isn't she? 




 That was a very good idea I must say.  




 The delay between the ball going off screen for the last time and coming back on is not long enough  




 My what?!
 









 My reply to those people: don't like reddit? Don't use it! 




 What the fuck guys. For all we know there was a good reason to fire Victoria. People make up their mind about something they don't know anything about
 




 Food is key.  




 My grandfather (who already died years ago) was 15 when he was sent to Russia to fight. If what my family tells me is true he got there, was brought to the front unarmed and was captured. He spent the next years in a Russian prison and came back when he was 20.

He was fucked in the head. He never got over the hunger he experienced in prison so he would never share food and he would always have tons of food in the freezer. He didn't sleep well and never talked about it. He beat his wife and children. 

He received a pension but that is it. No mental support, no therapy. Nobody thanked him or was proud of him. Nobody gave a shit basically. And to this day when people talk about him, nobody gives a shit that he was sent to fight 









 Good to know. If you've never been to the US and don't actually know what it's like, the Internet paints a pretty bad picture.  




 I swear outside if the US nobody needs shit like this. 

I lived in Germany most of my life. I have never had any problem with police even when we were causing trouble.

 Great work. 

I just want to point out, that you were not skinny fat. You were fat.

But otherwise a nice picture. Would you mind sharing the raw file if you have one? 




 Here are the translated lyrics

[Part 1]

My biceps shall burn

Instead of always running away from me

I want to aim at the target

And since then I am only working out

***[Hook]***

This is a current trend

Even more than the Advent

This is THE event

My biceps burns

I am a workout talent

doing the experiment

permanently

My biceps burns

***[Part 2]***

I had almost given up

I was thinking

Throw what I carry with me (makes no sense)

All gone, the baggage, the Sixpack

I'm always pumping

My mama already thought

I had gone to the brothel with Armin

***[Hook] again***

***[Outro]***

My biceps burns

My biceps burns

Workout Talent

My biceps burns

Following the trend

My biceps burns

permanently

My biceps burns

 People on reddit don't like mainstream it seems. I don't know shit here.

 Same, but I was prepared for it.

 It really isn't. It is a fun to watch episode, but does not add anything to the overall story. 

Come on!

 And they will be ignored  




 Fair enough. I get your point and I don't think you are wrong. I understand that many people rely on artists like Swift to make a living. I also have no numbers that show Apple provides more welfare than Swift's label. 

I simply think that (even though I really dislike Apple) if Apple manages to provide a service that many people will use (iOS and Android) that will further limit piracy and will be providing better/similar performance and user experience that current offers (like Spotify) provide and if to do that and to penetrate the marker they regard it as necessary to offer 3 months free trial, then Swift should stop complaining that she is not getting paid for 3 months. 
 




 What I mean is she said artists don't get paid. There is no information about whether or not the labels won't make any money. It actually says that the labels expect a positive long term effect. The people are not employed by swift, but by the label. So her not getting the money should be acceptable if the apple secures jobs and the labels expect it to pay off in the long run. 

I hope this is understandable. I can't put it any better.  




 Do we know the meaning behind this? 




 She won't vanish, just because she doesn't get paid by Apple 3 months. Also she is only saying artists don't get paid. She doesn't give a shit about jobs  




 Every time I read something like this I am shocked. In Germany, where I am from this just doesn't happen. We have a social security system that will in your case probably pay you benefits for being an orphan, your rent (if you flat fits the maximum size allowed) and some money to eat.

It's all good that America is the greatest country on Earth but this is unacceptable.  




 The only thing the bothers me about what she is saying is this:

 Swift hints that Apple can easily afford to eat the costs of paying out to labels during that period

Yes, they can, but so can she. The only difference is that Apple is a company that provides jobs for many people and therefore I'd rather they have the money and pay their people well. 

I don't think there is any problem with Taylor not getting the money for three month. This is not even considering that if she does not put her music on there, she also doesn't get any money.

Thank you for watching!  




 What about z3 then? Same phone just bigger and 1080p. Battery life is also great on that.  









 I don't. I'm assuming something. If I'm wrong it's all good  




 I'm not saying that. But I don't think they should do it. I want to be the one to open the package first.  




 I actually mind, that they are playing around with them, putting them back in the box and then selling them as new. 

Or am I misunderstanding something? 




 So pretty. Love it 




 What? It's a good haircut, but the black stuff looks like shit. 




 Android chrome looks the same 




 Passive aggressive  




 I totally get where your question is going. 

All the answers make sense and try to show you a way to get out of an awkward situation. 

However I would like to recommend something else. 

If somebody has a certain budget and wants to spend that, that's fine. To that person it won't matter if they can get the same quality (considering their level of skill) as with one that is below their budget. So if you actually have the knowledge, recommend a camera that is good and is within their budget. Who are you to say that their pictures will turn out like shit and they don't have the potential to actually make use of the camera.

Now the important part is manage expectations. Try before buy is the motto. Who buys an expensive camera before taking it for a spin? If you have the time, let them take a few pictures with your camera. They'll see what they look like. If you don't have the time, tell them to ask in the store. Of course you should tell them why they should try the camera first and see what pictures they end up with. 

But you shouldn't feel bad and it should not be an awkward situation. If you recommend something and they are too lazy to try it first: their fault. They don't have to follow your advice. 

And for the guy who complained after: why don't you show him the kind of picture you can take with it.  




 So, I had the same problem. 

I bought a cable though, no adapter. 

I bought [this](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00EI41K26?psc=1 redirect=true ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00) cable and had the exact same problem. Would not detect the cable and I did not see anything. The cable has many good reviews so I guess I just got unlucky. 

Then I bought [this](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00965EMF4?psc=1 redirect=true ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s01) and I am super happy with it. 

What I am trying to say is: Maybe your surface is faulty or settings need to be changed. But chances are you got a shitty adapter. I tried a different cable and that worked for me.

 




 I really wonder how many potential customers:

- Don't give a shit about thickness and want a decent battery life
- Don't give a shit about specs, just want a flashy phone

Seems like the industry believes number 2 to be the majority 




 Why do all these low budget smart phones have huge batteries? Why would they not put them in the flagships? Why do they believe that flagships don't need that? 




 Sorry, I was joking. Did not come across I guess  




 ...Spoiler Alert 




 I know right. I love that episode because there is little action but it's still such a great thriller. 




 Thank you very much. That means it's close almost finished Season 1 last week. 

Can't wait for that episode 




 If they would always show that in bigmacs, I would pay a monthly fee for it.  




 I think that is one of my favourite episodes. 




 That's fair enough. Actually I am not sure, but as far as I understand fantheories are just alternative versions of the truth within a story, that would also fit with the facts of that story (I hope that makes sense). 

So I think my idea would make sense, but I understand that that is not the actual intention of the writers even though I would prefer it to be.  




 Taking this opportunity I would like to express that this is one of the few subs that I am active on that does not ever frustrate me. All the responses are always cool and respectful and on topic. Really appreciate that.

Why are you asking? What do you prefer or what were you expecting?
