 Got one in the face a few months ago (Riding with the shield up, as usual) right under the nose. I was able to swat the fucker off in time but it made me completely hysterical. Man I hate those things they're always bad news. 














 On 10 May 1945 over Okinawa, Marine Lieutenant Robert R. Klingman and three other pilots of VMF-312 climbed to intercept a Kawasaki Ki-45 Toryu ("Nick") twin-engined heavy fighter flying reconnaissance at 25,000 feet (7,600 m), but the "Nick" began climbing higher. Two of the FG-1D Corsairs ceased their pursuit at 36,000 feet (11,000 m), but Marine Captain Kenneth Reusser and his wingman Klingman continued to 38,000 feet (12,000 m), expending most of their .50 caliber ammunition to lighten their aircraft. Reusser scored hits on the "Nick's" port engine, but ran out of ammunition, and was under fire from the Japanese rear gunner. Klingman lined up for a shot at a distance of 50 feet (15 m) when his guns jammed due to the extreme cold. He approached the "Nick" three times to damage it with his propeller, chopping away at his opponent's rudder, rear cockpit, and right stabilizer. The Toryu spun down to 15,000 feet (4,600 m) where its wings came off. Despite missing five inches (13 cm) from the ends of his propeller blades, running out of fuel and having an aircraft dented and punctured by debris and bullets, Klingman safely guided his Corsair to a deadstick landing. He was awarded the Navy Cross.

 That is a beautiful vintage ride. Check the tank for rust, if the tires are old they'll want replacing, be sure chain and sprockets are in good shape. Old carbs can varnish, consider a thorough cleaning. The shocks are likely shagged, this era motorbike never did handle well-consider replacing, and the forks need at minimum new oil if not rebuild.

If you're not mechanically inclined consider investing in a professional's care. I know the lads at my local Honda shop (who are a good lot) would LOVE to work on an old girl like yours.

Happy trails!

 Of all withdrawal syndromes alcohol withdrawal is potentially the most deadly. It lowers the seizures threshold, and if you have seizures when you are alone and without help, you will die. Benzodiazepines are the mainstay of mild to moderate alcohol withdrawal syndrome; more severe withdrawal requires ICU management with dexmedetomidine, propofol or phenobarbital infusions.

If you are a heavy drinker seeking to quit, or know someone who is, please seek medical care to do so. You can always go to an emergency room if you cannot get into detox. Don't mess around: stay on the planet.

 I was taught that it was the duty of those with knowledge and ability to enlighten those around them (my kids have their own opinion on this matter). I come to reddit to find things out, and the replies to questions that other redditors raise often enlighten me, too. Even if I think I know the answer I may find flaws in my memory. And of course the discussions that questions provoke are often the real meat of a post.

 A thorough inspection by a certified mechanic would be worth the fee if you are mechanically-challenged. The service dept at my local Honda dealer (who are a great bunch of ~~guys~~ mechanics) would love to look over such a great old bike-the first year of production was '72. 

Most important are tires, chain, brakes, swingarm and steering bearings, controls (brake/clutch/throttle). [Here](http://www.msf-usa.org/downloads/T-CLOCS_Inspection_Checklist.pdf) is the MSF checklist.

Do yourself a favor and get a shop manual. Even if you don't do the work yourself it's a great way to learn more about your ride.

If sound, yes that old motorcycle will run all day at 70 mph-you'll wear out before it will.

Congratulations on owning a classic!

 1965, if minibikes count. Got a Honda 90 about '68 




 A little googling reveals that you can download one [here](https://www.tradebit.com/filedetail.php/208114679-suzuki-dr-z125-service-manual-repair-2003-2013-drz125) for $5 




 I had a paper route and would sometimes work before school (grade school) riding on a milk truck, taking the order to the customer's front door and getting the empties ($4 a day was a lot of money in 1965). I saved enough to buy a beat up, used lawn mower engine, fixed it up (I hate rebuilding carbs to this day) and put it in a used minibike frame. I'll never forget the day I got the centrifugal clutch and took my first ride.

The first real motorcycle I bought was a Honda 90 in the late 60s. Then a 450, a 750 and so on but that minibike was my first taste of freedom on two wheels.
