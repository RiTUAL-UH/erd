 Okay, I was wondering what was going on. 




 Are you able to install Avira to just do scans with no real-time? 




 No, actually mostly adware. It has found some trojans as well. 




 I run AdAware in it's second line of defense mode so it just scans, no real-time protection. I've found that it finds more than the paid version of BitDefender. The downside is that the scans can take longer than other AVs.

 The free version of Ad-Aware has found way more viruses than my paid version of Bit-Defender. You can install Ad-Aware as a 2nd line of defense by having Real-Time Protection off. 




 Don't forget to go through msconfig and take off unwanted start up programs and services. 




 You will probably need something like [this.](http://forums.lenovo.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/169i7439D0FCBFE8A695/image-size/medium?v=mpbl-1 px=-1) If you have funds for the more expensive one, I would go with that. The cheaper one looks like your ears would hurt a bit after a while.
