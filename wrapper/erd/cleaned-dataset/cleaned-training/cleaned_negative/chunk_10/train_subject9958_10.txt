 My understanding is pets are a luxury.  Something you have to feed and spend time taking care of.  As such most societies did not have pets except, perhaps, the very upper classes (i.e. royalty).

That is not to say peasants and such did not keep animals.  They certainly did but those animals had to pay their own way (so to speak).  That could be a cat keeping vermin in check or a dog guarding things and so on.

In short the "pets" had to work for a living.

 Solar and wind are nowhere even remotely close to being practical as a replacement for coal and petroleum. They probably won't be for the next few decades.

Well...

[Denmarks wind farms generated 140% of the countrys electricity needs yesterday](http://qz.com/450737/denmarks-wind-farms-generated-140-of-the-countrys-electricity-needs-yesterday/)

The point is not to pull the plug on the oil overnight.

The point is to help coax alternative power methods along.  Give them the same subsidies and government investment and help that the oil industry has and still does enjoy.  Finance university research into alternative methods.

It need not even be just wind and whatnot.  There are proposals for a [CO2 recycler](https://www.minds.com/blog/view/468466376596533248/new-co2-recycler-captures-carbon-dioxide-from-the-atmosphere-and-turns-it-back-into-fuel) which takes CO2 out of the air, combines the CO2 with hydrogen and makes hydrocarbons sufficient to make fuel with.  In this manner you create a loop of carbon out and carbon back in.  Better still you can build this in the shittiest places in the world (e.g. the middle of a desert...maybe use wind and solar to help run it).  Land's cheap and not being used for anything else anyway.

There is a lot of potential and, better still, this should prompt economic growth and not restrict it as new industries pop up to provide these products.

 Hypocritical: 

- They euthanize animals at an alarming rate.  No kill shelters exist.  PETA is not one of them.

 From your link:

Some groups doubt the millionaire-migration theory. Jon Whiten, a deputy director of New Jersey Policy Perspective, said long-term statistics show that tax rates do not cause the rich to flee.

"If millionaires were truly trying to flee NJ's top income tax rate, we probably would have lost a lot more when the rates were higher," Whiten said. "But during the 2000s NJ almost doubled the number of tax filers above $500K at a time when the tax rate was increased on them, twice." 




 Space is definitely a "thing" as proved by Einstein.  Space itself curves which we perceive as gravity.  If there was nothing to curve there'd be no gravity.

 Among other reasons mentioned here spicy food can cause you to sweat which helps cool you down.

EDIT to add: Downvote away...it's true:

- [How Spicy Foods Can Cool You Down On A Hot Day](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/27/spicy-food_n_1628200.html)

Q: My husband insists that eating hot, spicy food during hot weather actually helps you cool off. He is wrong about so many things. Please tell him he is wrong about this. I think hes going to
give himself a stroke.

A: Sorry, lady. He got this one right. Why do you think a lot of spicy dishes come from hot places, such as Mexico or Thailand or India?

Ever think of that? Huh?

When you eat spicy food all sorts of things happen. Your body decides to cool off. Blood vessels close to the surface of your skin, especially on your face and neck, expand so the blood can throw off heat.

Your internal temperature goes down while your skin temperature goes up. You sweat, and as the sweat evaporates it cools you off. SOURCE: [Eat Spicy Foods to Cool Off?](http://arizonaoddities.com/2012/05/eat-spicy-foods-to-cool-off/)

 Yeah.  You should see inside right before they leave port.  They cram food in most everywhere they possibly can (within some reason).

 Maybe so.  Regardless the workers deserve to share in the new found prosperity too. 




 The issue is that while [productivity of Americans has risen over the past 30+ years](http://i.imgur.com/9L4MlB1.png) wages have not gone up and remained nearly flat.

The CEOs and top 1% are siphoning that money into their pockets.

Think of it this way.  Imagine you get paid $10/hour and can build 100 widgets per hour.  In time, through hard work, longer hours and so on, you improve to be able to build 200 widgets per hour.  Except you still get paid the same and the CEO takes a pay rise.
 




 Not all media is saying that.  Have a look through /r/politics to see many stories posted about Sanders' improving chances.

 The recent Batman debacle made me wonder this.

Here is an example of what I am talking about:

**PS4: PC-like architecture, 8GB RAM delight developers** 

What a difference a generation makes. Cerny's run-through of the PS4's specifications marked the end of the way of the PS3, with its befuddling Cell processor. 

snip

"The console itself is exactly what developers were hoping for. The familiar PC architecture means we can fast track our focus on the content rather than navigating the system's complexities which will surely result in better quality titles for players across the board."  [SOURCE](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-02-22-ps4-pc-like-architecture-8gb-ram-delight-developers)

And...

"Ultimately, we are trying to strike a balance between features which you can use day one, and features which will allow the system to evolve over the years, as gaming itself evolves," said Cerny. The "supercharged PC architecture," that the team has come up with -- to use Cerny's term -- is designed to offer significant gains the PC can't, while still offering a familiar technological environment for engineers.  [SOURCE](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/191007/inside_the_playstation_4_with_mark_.php?print=1)

I understand that the PS4/XBone are not exactly just modded PCs but it remains that they tried to get away from weird architectures that would allow developers a familiar platform to make development simpler.

So why all the problems with ports?

 Think of it this way.

The more mass something has the harder it is to change its speed.

But then it also has more stuff for gravity to pull on.

These two things balance out. 




 I'm 48 and when I consider things I got to experience that later generations missed out on Looney Tunes is near the top of the list.

That said a later generation got Animaniacs which was outstanding so not all was lost.
 









 Customer support is expensive and Steam has no competitive reason that would force them to improve customer service so instead they keep the money rather than spending it on improved customer service.

 




 The chips in computers are designed to operate on only a few volts of power.

A static shock can be in the neighborhood of [20,000 - 25,000 volts](http://www.livescience.com/4077-shocking-truth-static-electricity.html).  More than enough to fry a chip designed to run on 1-2 volts.
 




 You just have to aim the probe carefully at Jupiter to skirt around the side of the planet.

As the probe approaches the planet it speeds up.  Once it passes the planet the gravity slows it down but if you aim the probe with care it slingshots around the planet and steals a bit of the planet's angular momentum increasing its speed. (gravity assists can be used to slow down too)

New Horizon gained about 9,000 mph from the slingshot maneuver which decreased its travel time to Pluto by about three years.

It also got some [nifty photos of Jupiter](https://www.google.com/search?q=new+horizons+jupiter+flyby+images biw=1680 bih=911 tbm=isch tbo=u source=univ sa=X ved=0CB0QsARqFQoTCPeu-Yqp4MYCFcsrHgodh9cEkw) as it went by (because why not as long as you are there anyway).
 




 The probe got its speed from conventional rockets.  In space once you start going you keep going so it got an initial push then coasted the rest of the way.

Additionally the probe got a gravity assist from Jupiter.  Basically it used the gravity of Jupiter to speed itself up as it "fell" towards the gas giant.

As for its nuclear battery the probe uses a [Radioisotope thermoelectric generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator).  Basically there is a lump of plutonium on board and as the plutonium decays it gives off heat.  The generator uses thermocouples which convert heat into electricity.  Since it takes a long time for the plutonium to decay it can generate electricity for a long time.

 You're completely right but I am tired of voting for the lesser of two evils rather than a candidate I like.

Given a choice between Clinton and (say) Trump the choice is simple (Clinton) but I'll hold my nose while doing it.

And therein lies the problem.  Clinton (and her staff) are well aware of this.  As a result she knows she does not need to pander to the more liberal side of the party because she knows they won't pull the lever for the conservative anyway.  So she can safely tell them to all go fuck themselves and what are they going to do?

 




 They can't because there is no sole owner of these companies.  Shareholders are part owners in the company and they all get a say. 









 ELI5 answer is because the US is spending more than it collects in taxes.

You cannot point to one thing and say that is the culprit because it is all the things the US pays for combined.  In short it is low taxes and high spending.

It [is not entirely fair to pin blame on Obama](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/is-obama-responsible-for-a-5-trillion-increase-in-the-debt/2012/05/15/gIQACA0QSU_blog.html) for it but he does bear some of the responsibility. 




 While my company does pay its interns (and pretty well too) it should be noted that interns in general cost us more than we ever get in work from them.  The time it takes to train them is time lost doing other things and their productivity is kinda crap (no fault of their own...they are new and learning) and the time it takes us to fix their mistakes is yet more lost productivity from salaried employees.

If they were unpaid it'd still be a pretty good deal for them for the experience.  As I said though we believe in paying them and I think that's the right thing to do (and we pay well above minimum wage).  It's just not (necessarily) fair to characterize an unpaid internship as ripping off the intern.
 




  The Eastern District of Texas does not directly make a lot of money from this litigation. Only a $400 filing fee per patent case, and some more for admission of attorneys to practice before the court. Nothing earth shattering. BUT, my having a big docket of cases, they can get a bigger share of the budget for federal courts. 

Companies are sued there so often they now pander to the residents.

 The New Horizons spacecraft, due to its distance, can only [send data at 1 kilobit/second (125 bytes/second).](http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2015/01300800-talking-to-pluto-is-hard.html)

In short, your cell phone does considerably better speed wise but considering the distance to New Horizons it is still pretty remarkable.

 DDOS attacks are usuall run by [Botnets.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botnet)

Basically viruses/trojans/malware that infect numerous computers allowing the person running the thing to take control of thousands of computers (obviously the people whose computer has been compromised are unaware of it).
 




 DDOS = Distributed Denial Of Service

It is akin to a few thousand people calling you all at once.

When that happens your phone would never stop ringing and you'd have a tough time managing to make an outbound call.

In short, a LOT of computers (tens of thousands usually) all try to connect to one computer at the same time.  The receiving computer gets overwhelmed and cannot respond effectively to anyone essentially shutting it down.

 The short, ELI5 version is after joining the EU Greece got access to cheap credit that it could not access before.

Greece went on a borrowing binge.  Essentially borrowing way more then it could ever reasonably expect to be able to pay back.  It got to a point where they'd borrow just to pay on their already existing debts.

Eventually the EU got wise and tightened up their requirements for lending.  Greece was no longer able to borrow money and so were about to default on their loans (not pay them).

The EU started making arrangements with Greece to implement austerity measures (i.e. belt tightening measures) in return for loans to continue paying their debts.  These austerity measures had the effect of smashing the Greek economy causing massive unemployment among other problems.

The people voted to stop the austerity measure but the EU told Greece it was that or default.  They fought about it a bit but looks like the EU prevailed and the Greek government has agreed to another round of austerity in return for new loans.
 




 Charter schools win.  Neighborhood schools not so much. 









 Modern humans (i.e. the species we all belong to today) came on the scene around 200,000 years ago (not 5 million).  We know this because [the earliest remains of homo sapiens sapiens are about 195,000 years old](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omo_remains) give or take 5,000 years.

The [oldest known cave paintings](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/09/science/ancient-indonesian-find-may-rival-oldest-known-cave-art.html) are about 40,000 years old.

The [oldest known stone tools](http://www.livescience.com/50908-oldest-stone-tools-predate-humans.html) pre-date modern humans and are about 3.3 million years old.

In short, there is actual evidence for these timelines.  Just because modern humans did not come up with written languages till the last 5,000 years does not mean they weren't walking around a lot earlier than that.

[A]s a college student he organized sit-ins against segregation, worked for a union, protested police brutality and attended the 1963 March on Washington.

His father was a paint salesman from Poland and a high school dropout, and the family lived paycheck-to-paycheck. When Sanders father went with his wife to see the play The Death of a Salesman, his father so identified with the underemployed Willy Loman that he broke down in tears. The lack of money caused stress in my family and fights between my mother and father, Sanders explained to TIME in an interview this month. That is a reality I have never forgotten: today, there are many millions of families who are living under the circumstances that we lived under.

snip

In Chicago, Sanders threw himself into activismcivil rights, economic justice, volunteering, organizing. I received more of an education off campus than I did in the classroom, Sanders says. By his 23rd birthday, Sanders had worked for a meatpackers union, marched for civil rights in Washington D.C., joined the university socialists and been arrested at a civil rights demonstration. 

snip

The civil rights movement also became a home for him. He became leaders of an NAACP ally called the Congress of Racial Equality at a time when most civil rights activists were black. He was arrested while demonstrating for desegregated public schools in Chicago. (No big deal, says Sanders: You can go outside and get arrested, too! he jokes. Its not that hard if you put your mind to it.) He once walked around Chicago putting up fliers protesting police brutality. After half an hour, he realized a police car was following him, taking down every paper hed up, one by one. Are these yours? he remembers the officer telling him, holding up the stack of the fliers.

 **Who is More Conservative: Ronald Reagan or Barack Obama?**

The bottom line is that, no matter what the reason, Obama seems to be in some important ways significantly to the right of Reagan on the political spectrum. If Reagan ordered the execution of US citizens abroad, he might have been impeached. If Obama tried to give undocumented immigrants blanket amnesty the way Reagan did, he might be impeached.

I don't think Obama is a hard right-winger. It's just that the political establishment in this country has moved so far to the right (though not the public, according to polls on specific issues) that as a natural politician when he goes to appease them, he is solidly center-right on the spectrum.

 It remains the bank's risk.

Anytime they give a loan, to anyone, there is a risk of default.  There is a risk the borrower is lying.  That stuff is priced into the interest rate on the loan.

It is up to the banks to do their due diligence and investigate the borrower for credit worthiness and to not make loans so large to one entity that a default by that entity constitutes a threat to the solvency of the bank.
 




  Lending money to a first-world country that's a member of the euro doesn't sound like it should be much of a risk. 

Nevertheless it is *their* risk and not ours.  That is the name of the game.  It does not matter whether they thought these were good loans or not.  They are privatizing profits and socializing the losses.

It's like you go to Vegas and expect to keep your winnings but have others foot the bill when your bets go bad.  It should not work like that.

The departments criteria indicate that, in order to qualify as an unpaid internship, the work must, among other things, be similar to training offered in a school setting, be performed for the benefit of the intern rather than the employer and not nudge aside that of existing employees.

 Companies do save money by replacing workers with machines (they would not do it otherwise).

That extra money can go to a number of places:

- It can reduce the price of their product making them more competitive.
- Re-invest the money in expanding or improving elsewhere.
- The executives take higher salaries.
- The owners pocket the difference (usually stock holders but sometimes individuals).

All that said governments can and do turn on the printing presses for various reasons.  Sometimes it is in their interest to debase their currency but that pisses off a lot of people.

Here is a [better explanation](http://www.amendmentgazette.com/how-spending-money-became-a-form-of-speech/) than I can provide here.

In short it started with [Buckley v. Valeo](http://www.fec.gov/law/litigation_CCA_B.shtml#buckley) and culminated with Citizens United.

From Buckley:

A restriction on the amount of money a person or group can spend on political communication during a campaign necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached.  This is because virtually every means of communicating ideas in todays mass society requires the expenditure of money. The distribution of the humblest handbill or leaflet entails printing, paper, and circulation costs. Speeches and rallies generally necessitate hiring a hall and publicizing the event. The electorates increasing dependence on television, radio, and other mass media for news and information has made these expensive modes of communication indispensable instruments of effective political speech.
 









 I agree free speech needs to be diligently protected but Citizens United put corporate speech on par with individual speech and deemed that money = speech.  

Therein lies the problem. 




 Doesn't really matter.

It remains you cannot yell "fire" in a crowded theater when there is no fire and expect protection under free speech. 




 By law people in the public eye have far less claim to being slandered than your average Joe does.  In addition:

There is a unique rule of tort injury law that protects news entertainers Rush Limbaugh, Bill O' Reilly and Sean Hannity from liability from nearly any slanderous remark they make about any private citizen or public figure.

In tort law a plaintiff cannot bring a libel lawsuit against a defendant with a public reputation as a liar. 

The legal reasoning is that a known liar cannot damage the reputation of anybody, because nobody will believe the slanderous remarks of a known public liar!That means that Limbaugh, Hannity and O' Reilly have made so many inaccurate, misleading and untruthful remarks about various people that they cannot be sued for libel because any reasonable person would never believe anything they said. So goes the precedent of law.

Therefore Limbaugh, Hannity and O'Reilly are practically exempt from tort actions and the more they slander people the harder it becomes to bring a lawsuit against them.  [SOURCE](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2007/01/09/288674/-Why-Limbaugh-or-Fox-News-Are-Never-Sued-for-Libel)

Add to that Fox has battalions of expensive lawyers so suing them would be mighty expensive and difficult.

That said they do get sued for it.  Most recently [Lindsay Lohan has sued for defamation.](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/lindsay-lohan-mother-file-defamation-lawsuit-against-fox-news/)   




 No rights are absolute.  They are all circumscribed to one degree or another.  For instance the right to free speech is limited in a number of ways.  You cannot slander someone or yell "fire" in a crowded theater (when there is no fire) and claim free speech as protection.

So, understanding the unique role of elections in a democracy and seeking to maintain their integrity is a worthy goal and one the state has a legitimate interest in.  Citizen's United threw the door wide on corporate spending in elections.

The majority argued that the First Amendment protects associations of individuals in addition to individual speakers, and further that the First Amendment does not allow prohibitions of speech based on the identity of the speaker. Corporations, as associations of individuals, therefore have speech rights under the First Amendment. Because spending money is essential to disseminating speech, as established in Buckley v. Valeo, limiting a corporation's ability to spend money is unconstitutional because it limits the ability of its members to associate effectively and to speak on political issues. 

snip

At bottom, the Court's opinion is thus a rejection of the common sense of the American people, who have recognized a need to prevent corporations from undermining self government since the founding, and who have fought against the distinctive corrupting potential of corporate electioneering since the days of Theodore Roosevelt. It is a strange time to repudiate that common sense. While American democracy is imperfect, few outside the majority of this Court would have thought its flaws included a dearth of corporate money in politics.

 If they make a clear, public and *legally binding* commitment I'll believe them. 

EDIT:  Spelling 




 Dunno why but it is hard to see her as a her.

Maybe it is just bulldogs having a male vibe.  

Regardless I wish I could pet her and hold her.
 




 I am pretty sure this is sarcasm but it is worth noting here (as people reading this may have cause to enlighten some others) that the Civil War was absolutely about slavery from the get-go.  

Lincoln was fighting (initially) to preserve the union and said if he had to let slavery continue to do that then that is what he'd do.

But for the southern states it was always about slavery and the thing is they were pretty explicit about it:

*...an increasing hostility on the part of the non-slaveholding States to the institution of slavery...* SOURCE: [Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/csa_scarsec.asp)

They actually go on quite a bit about slavery in that document.  It is absolutely the central issue for them.

And then there is Mississippi:

*Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery-- the greatest material interest of the world.* SOURCE: [A Declaration of the Immediate Causes which Induce and Justify the Secession of the State of Mississippi from the Federal Union](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/csa_missec.asp)

So yeah, it was about slavery.
 




 That or the publisher said, "Here's $100, do the best you can.  You've got a week."

Iron Galaxy's reputation is on the line.  Either they suck at their jobs or they did as well as anyone could within the restrictions they had (time-frame, budget, etc. imposed by the publisher). 




 Yeah.  This is what I don't get.

Was there no oversight from Rocksteady?  Did they just hand it off and hope everything just went to plan?  Did no one test this before it came out?

I mean, there is always someone who will complain a new game doesn't run right upon release but when this many people are complaining it is hard to imagine how this was missed if there was anything like quality control.
 




 I had it work the other way around.

I got my card a week before Batman was added to the deal.  I contacted Newegg (who I had bought the card from) and asked if I could get Batman added to it.

They were totally cool and did.

As a result a few weeks later I bought all the components for my new computer from them as my way of supporting that great customer service. 




 Actually I got the Witcher AND Batman so can't complain.
 




 Unfortunately (or fortunately depending how you look at it) I got mine as a promotion whey I bought my last video card.

I can't return it but then it technically didn't cost me anything.
 




 To be fair I'd hardly call a 970 "puny".  It's very nearly as good as a 980.  970 is probably the 3rd fastest card of the last 6 months and only barely at that.

Doubtless some people will nitpick but bottom line it is not "puny".
 









  If that weren't the case, the system would be bleeding money, because let's get real, bankruptcy at age 22 to erase 20 to 100K of loans is an option that a ton of people would take. 

This is the story the banks want you to believe and what they were peddling when they first lobbied to make it impossible to discharge a student loan through bankruptcy.

Stagflation was sending an unprecedented number of Silent Majority members into bankruptcy, and the bank lobby was fighting back with a propaganda assault that scapegoated counterculture student delinquents who were allegedly taking loans with no goal of paying them. As Shuchman and others explained in hearings, only about 4 percent of people who filed for bankruptcy protection in 1975 had student loans on their balance sheets, and of those, fewer than one-fifth did not have substantial other debts motivating them to file.

 I guess she should have had a better lawyer.

I think she represented herself.  She cannot afford an attorney. 









 So it is a matchmaking thing?  If you have a higher tier ship you are matched against better players?
 




 I am with you on not ganking noobs.

Way back in the day (in a different game) I had that happen to me in the noob starting zone.

Was not a fan.  I won't do it here.
 




  Possibly upload a replay, so people can say what you're doing wrong.

Is there a simple way to record your game play in WoWS?

I suppose I can use Nvidia's thing but have never tried it.
 




 In my case I pretty much get owned left and right using the Tier-7 USS Sims yet rock-and-roll with the Tier-5 USSR Grenaschy (sp?).

Both are destroyers.  Both seem to be sort of equivalent but holy shit...I have a great time and reasonable success with the USSR destroyer and regularly achieve nothing with the Sims.

What gives?  I mean, I know no one here has seem my gameplay (probably) but I cannot imagine why there is such a disparity.

NOTE:  I am NOT blaming the game and calling for nerfs or buffs.  99.9% certain the fault lies with me.  Just can't figure out where.
 




 This.

I have launched wide spreads and tight spreads from as close as 3km (2km in one case I remember) and had battleships dodge them all or, maybe, take one hit.  Long range?  Forget it.  The only time I get any torp hits at over 5km is by sheer luck.

Add to that the torps do not do a whole lot of damage.  They should be among the most devastating hits in the game but four hits on a BB barely takes it down by a third of total HP.  To think any BB can soak up 12+ torps (from a ship, not planes) before dying is ridiculous.  

I think the issue with a DD surviving a 16" gun hit is over penetration of those shells.  They pretty much go right through, poking a hole in the ship without exploding.

And I can guarantee the secondaries on a BB lay on plenty of hurt. Unless the BB drivers want to make DDs literally worthless they have it pretty good already.  You can ignore a DD (except to evade torps) and leave your secondaries to put on the hurt.  A DD has to get into your secondary range, well within it, for any reasonable chance at a successful torp strike.  DD guns are literally worthless against a BB.  It is torps or nothing (so much so I never even bother shooting guns at a BB most times except out of boredom).

All-in-all a BB has it pretty good vs a DD.  Watch the list at the top of ships (green and red) and almost always the first things dead on the field are all the DDs.  That hardly speaks of OP destroyers.

ETA:  [Here is a carrier dodging multiple torpedoes in a single strike](https://youtu.be/mCzFMMXcEc8?t=1066) from close range.  Before you think you have it bad consider a miss rate like this from point-blank range. 




 Good.

I really do not want to see a Clinton coronation.

I'm not sure yet who I'll vote for but I expect all the candidates (Clinton included) to work for my vote.  If she figures to skate by and coast through the primaries I guarantee she will lose at least my vote.

I realize she probably does not give a shit about my vote but then she made that mistake running against Obama and by the time she got serious it was too late for her.  
 




 I live in Chicago and just dumped Sprint for Verizon.  Sprint's network here is painfully slow.  I could only barely browse the web without giving up in frustration most times.  Add in dropped calls were a regular occurrence.

I can never remember having four bars on my phone (well, sometimes it would show four bars but as soon as I'd do anything it'd immediately drop to one or two).

Verizon is more expensive but so far the service has been lightning fast in comparison.

EDIT:  Here is my current speed with Verizon.  This is faster than my home connection by a fair bit:  [71.6 down and 41 up](http://i.imgur.com/kBMAk3s.jpg) 




 It's also how phone calls find you.  The SIM identifies you to the system so when a call for you comes in the phone company knows which tower to route the call to. 




 That is a greatly simplified picture.

For instance, Pluto's orbit is elliptical enough that occasionally it is inside the orbit of Neptune and Neptune is further away from the sun (last time it was like this was from 1979 - 1999).
 




 All orbits are ellipses.

A perfectly spherical orbit is in theory possible but the details of the two orbiting bodies (mass, distance, velocity and so on) would have to be *exactly* spot on which is highly unlikely (not to mention other planets and whatnot can perturb an orbit so it likely would not stay perfect for long).
 




 Paul and his ilk are operating under the assumption that progressive taxes are somehow unfair.

As it happens, when you account for ALL taxes people pay (which is a lot more than just income tax) and measure the *effective* tax rate (what people actually pay versus what is advertised), then you can see [the tax rate across income groups is pretty flat](http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/13/just-how-progressive-is-the-tax-system/?_r=0) (except for the very poor).

A flat tax as he proposes would be highly regressive.  He'd be dramatically lowering taxes on the rich and dramatically raising them on the poor.  

In short, put the burden on the people least able to bear it.

 









 Hard tacos or soft tacos?

This is important. 




 Watch this 16 minute bit on [Predatory Lending by John Oliver.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDylgzybWAw)  (NSFW language) It explains the issue well and is funny even though the topic is anything but funny. 




 It is not censorship.

Germany has a copyright system in place that is even more screwy than what we have in the US.  They are very aggressive at taking down stuff they think is "owned" by someone else. 




 It has often been noted that the line between bribery and lobbying is very thin.

Technically a bribe is an outright quid pro quo.  You give person-X money and they will do whatever it is you ask.

Lobbying on the other hand is not technically a quid pro quo. It is merely going to talk to your representative about a particular issue and to try and convince them your way is the right way.  On the face of it that is fine.  However, "talking" to your representative may include flying them out to a 5-star resort and giving them a 3-Michelin star meal after a round of golf.  Add in a donation to their re-election fund.

The representative is not obligated to vote they way the lobbyist wants but they know where the good stuff comes from and so are likely to vote favorably for the lobbyist.
 




 Hence the Asterisk!

*Still in existence, by barrel weight.

The video says this cannon weighed 100 tons which equals 200,000 pounds.  As noted the Iowa battleship guns weighed in at 268,000 pounds.

The battleship Iowa also still exists.  You can go see it [here.](http://www.pacificbattleship.com/page/directions-)
 




 This is not the biggest gun.  Not even close.

- The [Paris Gun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Gun) had a barrel length of over 111 feet and a range of 81 miles.  Some say the shells likely arced into low earth orbit making them the first man made anything put into space.

- The [Schwerer Gustav](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwerer_Gustav) weighed in at 1,350 tonnes, had a barrel length of 106 feet and a range of 29 miles shooting a 7.1 tonne shell.

- If we want one still in existence (as in you can go see it and it, in theory, could be fired again) see the [Iowa Class battleship naval rifles.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16%22/50_caliber_Mark_7_gun)  Almost 67 feet long, weighing 268,000 pounds throwing a 2,700 pound projectile 24 miles. 




 Because Palin was clearly a moron.

Warren is clearly not a moron. 




 It may be trite but I think [this bit](https://youtu.be/zemrWBIc_hE?t=63) from the movie "American President" sums it up pretty well (at least the part I linked to). 




 The simple version is the computer uses something called the [North Bridge and South Bridge](http://routermatrix.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/NorthbridgeSouthbridge.jpg) to move data around.

Basically the CPU needs to talk to other parts of the computer.  System memory, the hard drive, peripherals and so on.

The north bridge is a chip dedicated to managing communication with with things that need the best performance (fast) so it would connect system memory and PCI-Express slots.  The south bridge would handle USB, SATA, PCI and other slower peripherals.

So, the CPU would need something and tell the appropriate chip to go get it for them.  Then that chip would handle communicating with the outside part and pass the info on to the CPU.

Of course all these items are on a motherboard and interconnected.

These days some CPUs have taken over the north bridge and put them on the CPU itself to be faster.  The south bridge is still there though.
 




 Run for public office as a republican. 




 True but it is paving the way to 1933.  1924 is recent history to the people of 1933 and certainly was a factor in the rise of the Nazi party.

 It was an effort to pay reparation during the Weimar Republic that led to hyperinflation in Germany.  Germany turned on its printing presses to print money in an effort to buy foreign currency with which to pay their debt.

That led to pictures [like this](http://www.wnd.com/images/washington110625.jpg) of people carting around money in wheelbarrows.  The exchange rate eventually got over 4 trillion German marks to the dollar.

Obviously that was ridiculous and untenable. Germany fell back into a barter economy for awhile there.
 




 Don't forget tax reasons.

If the hospital charges $1,000 for a band-aid and you don't pay the hospital gets to claim a $1,000 loss and write-off on their taxes. 




 In general the courts take a dim view of discrimination based on things you cannot change (gender, skin color, etc.).

Hygiene is distinctly under an individual's control and can be rectified to allow you to eat there. 




 The brain does not record memories like a hard drive.  You actually reconstruct memories as they are needed.  

Because of the way memories are encoded and stored, memory recall is effectively an on-the-fly reconstruction of elements scattered throughout various areas of our brains. Memories are not stored in our brains like books on library shelves, or even as a collection of self-contained recordings or pictures or video clips, but may be better thought of as a kind of collage or a jigsaw puzzle, involving different elements stored in disparate parts of the brain linked together by associations and neural networks. Memory retrieval therefore requires re-visiting the nerve pathways the brain formed when encoding the memory, and the strength of those pathways determines how quickly the memory can be recalled. Recall effectively returns a memory from long-term storage to short-term or working memory, where it can be accessed, in a kind of mirror image of the encoding process. It is then re-stored back in long-term memory, thus re-consolidating and strengthening it. [SOURCE](http://www.human-memory.net/processes_recall.html)
 




 He was but a lot of rich people were "making"money with Madoff.  In some respects it didn't matter if the money was there or not.  They could go to banks and get loans showing their account with Madoff as collateral.  No one wanted to admit the emperor had no clothes so they ignored it.
 




 A lot of very wealthy people and others had a lot of money invested with Madoff.  They all had paperwork from him that said they had $XXXX in their accounts.  These people have attorneys and know people in government.  When Madoff could not make good and give them the money he said they had these people called their attorneys and congresscritters.

As early as 2001 a fellow named [Harry Markopolos was trying to warn the SEC about Madoff.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madoff_investment_scandal#Bernard_L._Madoff_Securities_LLC:_1999.2C_2000.2C_2004.2C_2005.2C_and_2006)  Despite many attempts over the years the SEC ignored him and his (considerable) evidence.   




 Madoff was running a Ponzi scheme.  Basically they are promising big returns on your money that aren't really there.  The scheme works as long as people put money in but not a lot goes out.  As long as people think it is working the money flows mostly into the scheme and not out.

As it happened in 2008 there was a financial crisis.  Many people, taking losses elsewhere, went to Madoff and tried to withdraw money from their accounts (money they had been told was there).  Thing is the money was not there and Madoff could not make good on these requests.

That is when the whole thing fell apart.
