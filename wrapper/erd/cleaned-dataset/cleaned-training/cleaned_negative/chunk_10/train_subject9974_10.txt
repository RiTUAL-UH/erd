 Sure, [i love adding new folks too](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28108653-jash-comstock) 




 I am a goodreads user, as I am sure many of you are, and I am trying to up my review game. I want to contribute and participate in quality and thoughtful dialogue about the books I read. What makes a great review? What format tips, content tips, or other suggestions would you make to someone trying to improve their reviews? 




 Jesus was not a politician. In fact he tended to stay out of political discussions altogether (Matt. 22:21) 




 In the tsp website (not my pay). Once you enroll you should get a letter outlining how to log on 




 This is the answer I was looking for, thanks. 




 I realize it is already diversified, I never said it was not. But there is a spectrum of funds to contribute to, and I was just curious if there is any value to contributing to more than one. 









 Either would be fine with me 




 Can anyone recommend books documenting U.S history from a multicultural perspective? Something that explores the various influences that melted into the pot of our melting pot? Specifically African and Hispanic influences on early American thought, history, and culture. 




 I am a progressive Democrat and I agree with you. Background checks and registration are about as far as much gun control as I support. I am a proud gun owner myself. 




 Arguably it was FDR's fleet of weapons that saved England from being captured. They were pretty much done for on their own.



And if they had been occupied, I sincerely doubt that it would have meant global domination for the Nazis. The U.S. was not even in the picture at that point, FDR and the Russians likely would have routed the Nazis even without the help of England. 




 The zombie apocalypse has come, but you are able to teleport any world leader from the past or present to take charge of your nation to respond to the apocalypse. Who do you choose and why? 




 Considering the ridiculous gaggle that is the Republican party, he might not be as done as you think he is. 




 One of the things I admire the most about Bill Clinton's legacy is his emphasis on a peace-oriented foreign policy. Hillary seems to have a more hawkish legacy, support for the Iraq war, a hawkish time as Sec. Of State. 



What do y'all think?  




 As a working class Centrist Democrat I have long felt my party was moving away from me, Jim Webb inspires my optimism. I know he is unlikely to win against Clinton, but it is nice to know that my party isn't totally progressive. 









 Donald Trump 




 From what I understand the Army used to have two enlisted promotion tracks, one for leaders/NCOs and one for technocal experts (spc4 etc)

Why did we stop? Has pushing all soldiers into a leadership track had a serious impact on the NCO corps? Do you think we should go back to that practice? 




 Weird question I know. I do not see them as much anymore, but in old photos I always see Democrats wearing flat round straw hats (kind of like Barbershop Quartet straw hats) to conventions and stiff, usually with a patriotic band around the hat.. Can anyone explain whether this is strictly a Democrat thing and where it started? 




 Also, grouchy ass soldiers typically are preferable in the field to relaxed and comfortable soldiers. Ain't nothing wrong with a few bad attitudes every now and then

 Dude is lucky to have a girl who trusts him against such accusations! 




 I'd like to participate! 




 I am interested in history, gardening, fiction/literature, travel, and writing. I am fairly friendless (though not exactly antisocial). Anyone want to be my friend? 




 Depends on what you mean by "check out". Finding a girl attractive is totally natural, and appreciating it is totally ok in my book. Slobbering over her like a piece of meat is something else altogether. 




 I am a 22 year old bookworm and very shy with women/females and just want to expand my friend base to include more women. I thought perhaps reddit would be a good place to overcome my lifelong shyness with girls. I hope I am not coming off as pathetic/creepy, just looking for friends..

I am also a huge gearhead, I love working on my motorcycle. 









 Take a dance class. There are no downsides.

1. You will be more confident.


2. Ladies generally find dancing attractive. 

3. If you are single, dance classes are often a great place to meet other singles.




 




 Whenever I talk to most kids near my age I think *god my generation is a bunch of fucking morons*. 



I do not like to identify as a millenial. 




 Short answer; because Turkey has been at odds with the Kurds (the folks fighting ISIS) for a very long time. Many of the Peshmergas that are fighting ISIS now were fighting Turkey not long ago. 



They want ISIS to beat the Kurds (though they won't admit it) 









 One of the soldiers I serve with is originay from Sri Lanka and will not stop bragging about the country. This has really made me want to see the place for myself, but I do not hear about a lot of Sri Lanka tourism. 


**Length** Around a week. 


I love exploring Buddhist sacred places, and love seeing places that are out of the typical tourist paths. I have heard quite a bit about Sri Lanka's tea and spice production, this would be interesting to learn about first hand. I love food and am a lretty adventurous traveller.



Can anyone speak from experience about travelling to Sri Lanka? Any recommendations or warnings? What about websites, books, or articles about Sri Lanka that would be useful for my travel research.?
 




 I do not think English as a major was a mistake. College was a mistake. I have tons of debt, no job, and I am only now getting trained in a trade that can actually profit me. Many college grads are unemployed, while certified and unionized allied trade workers have phenomenal jobs. College is not for everyone, and do not let anyone tell you that you need to go to college to be successful. You need to have skills to be successful. There are other ways to procure those skills than college. Trade school, apprenticeship, the military etc can all make you *way* more successful than college and are way cheaper.. 


It is something to think about. 




 Yup. American high school kids are pretty much told that success= college. Blue collar jobs are seen as last resorts  by many. The truth is certified, unionized blue collar jobs make phenomenal money. Trade school is cheaper than college. Employment is way steadier and almost guaranteed in many areas. 




 I took all the basics, focused on tons of English and lit courses. I went to college (worst mistake of my life) for English, and I have been in the Army for the past four years... finally paying off debt. I wish I would have pursued trade school or an apprenticeship after highschool, college only gave me debt. 









 1. Who is your favorite Democrat President of all time?

2. Who is your favorite Republican President of all time?

3. Explain your choices. 




 I think it is significant that nearly every post 9/11 vet in the house and senate is a Democrat. Nearly every veteran caucus is a Democrat majority caucus. 



Most vets benefits were initiated by Democrats; the Montgomery G.I. Bill, Post 9/11 G.I. Bill.... And then uou have the so called "Fighting Dems" who took the Hill in '06, all Veterans, all critical of how Bush handled the GWOT, all Democrats..


I just do not understand why vets would support the hawkish right... 




 Thats awesome, I just saw the 173rd flag and was curious 




 Did you serve with The Herd? 




 Your father sounds like an amazing man. Thank you for sharing! 




 That is awesome! 














 


You made some really great points. I had never thought about how lower income people spend more money on things that actually benefit the economy, while higher income people are more likely to spend their tax cut on luxuries.. 



I am not entirely sold on the idea of progressive taxes, but you certainly gave me some food for thought to chew on.. 




 Politics are not allowed in /r/military 




 Veterans overwhelmingly support Republicans. It has been this way pretty much since FDR.. As a veteran myself, I see many of my brothers vehemently opposed to the Democratic party because of assumptions about our patriotism etc.. What message should our party extend to vets to let them know we are looking out for them? 




 The growth of a language as an international language is an organic thing, not something socially engineered by a board or anything. I am a native English speaker, and I agree that it is not the best language for international business use, but it is not something we can just change. It rose to power when the US spearheaded the growth of global economy. The organic nature of things like the languages people choose make it difficult to change. 




 I believe in a flat tax system, where everyone pays the same percentage of their earnings in income tax. I do not believe in a progressive tax system where richer people pay a higher percentage than poor people. I am a working class democrat, but I do not see a progressive system stimulating economic growth. It seems to me that it is punishing somebody for making more money, making it more desirable to stay in the middle class instead of encouraging people to work their way up into a higher class.. On the other hand, I believe a flat tax based would be fairer. Rich people would pay more (because 15% of a million is higher than 15% of 35'000) but would still be encouraged to leave their capital in the US economy instead of finding ways around the tax code... Can someone make a solid case for a progressive tax system directed at a working class guy like me?

 If I understand correctly, the labels *left wing* and *right wing* mean something different here in the US than the rest of the world. Is this true? 




 Yes indeed. Womens liberation and boobies  are a winning combination for me.

 The best you can do right now is look at their records I recommend [on the issues](http://www.ontheissues.org/default.htm).

Most of the candidates have not laid out clear cut policy stances yet, its too early in the race. For now they are just gonna talk about vague things like income inequality, climate change, etc without clearcut solutions. 




 u/ornitholoqy101 doesn't like boobs?


Neither did Stalin you commie bastard. 




 The typical chain of unit sizes goes like this; **Platoon** led by a Lieutenant and Sergeant First Class, **Company** led by a Captain and First Sergeant, **Battalion** led by a Lieutenant Colonel and Sergeant Major, **Brigade** led by a Colonel and Command Sergeant Major, and **Division** led by a General and Command Sergeant Major.


A regiment used to be the equivalent of two battalions, but now it is used by various sized units. 


An Airborne unit is a unit that is made up of Airborne Paratroopers, that trains to deploy via parachute into combat when needed. 




 Even in my dreams you blind me.

Not the kind of blind that takes away sight;

But the kind of blind that, taken breathless by a sight 

Attracts attention to that great sight in such a way 

That nothing else can be seen

For your colors are the only true colors.

Your contrast stands out against the blackness 

Like a veritable sunshine of bright eyes

And waves of hair that compete with the ocean in grace. 

I stumble around unsatisfied

For in having seen a sight so blinding

My vision remains imprinted with you.

Now, neither in this world or the one made of dreams

Could I ever have an unclouded view.

For you pump through my veins 

And leak from my pores

And my vision is blinded by you.

 It has been a day of sad memories, and I honestly just want to drink deeply from the bitter cup. Can y'all recommend the most melancholy songs you know? I want to be swept away by blunt force lyrics and sad, slow songs. 




 Never convicted, I was typing on my touchscreen.  














 You obviously have no clue what Capitalism is. None of those nations have free and unregulated economies. They are mixed economies. 


Workers own the means of production in those nations through cooperatives, and are backed up by very strict economic regulation from the state. None of those nations have government planned economies because as I have been saying all along *not all forms of socialism advocate state run economies*. Communism advocates state control, many socialists do not advocate for state control of the markets. Hell, Anarcho-Syndicalists and Libertarian Socialists are against the existence of **any state at all**.




For the record, I am neither a Socialist, or a Communist, I am a Laissez Faire Capitalists Libertarian. I just don't wrongly represent people I disagree with. 




 As I understand it, Marxists advocate for a moneyless society. 


What about non Marxist socialists? what role would money play in a socialist society? 




 You are using poor examples of Sanders' Democratic Socialist line of thought. China is nowhere near his radar. China is in the Marxist line of thought.


Sanders advocates Democratic Socialism, as found in Canada, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, and other European nations. Contrast the living examples of these Socialist nations to China (and more extremely North Korea) and you can see in living color the difference between Democratic Socialism and Communism.


I am not down voting you, maybe the community just thinks you are wrong. 




 Democratic socialism is reformist not revolutionary. They do not want to overthrow/abolish the state and monetary system, they want to reform the state. 




 He is a Democratic Socialist,  not a Marxist/Leninist. In policies he is more of a progressive.


He advocates worker control of the means of production achieved through democracy. 


Communism advocates participation in class revolution culminating in the abolition of class, state, and money.


They are two totally different things. 




 You just have to come to terms with the fact that your brother is a different person than you, and entitled to his own choices and lifestyle. Do you, and let him be him. 




 What is your ideal end state for U.S. policies on immigragion?



What realistic reforms would you like to see implemented after this next election? 




 The President is obviously for it, but many unions are very upset about the fast track in the TPP.


1. What are your thoughts on the TPP?

2. Do you think Democrat support for the TPP could affect the traditionally strong bond between organized labor and our party?  









 Which specific policies? 




 1. When has he ever voted against his declared opinion?


2. Which specific socialist policies?


3. He is a social democrat not a communist 




 If you think Bernie is a communist you are an idiot.


He is a social democrat. 




 What about Sanders?  




 1. Would you vote for Bernie Sanders over Hillary?


2. Would you vote for Bernie over Rand?


Why or why not? 









 I named that legislation because you wanted proof that he supported worker control of means of production.



It is more than a label, it is a perspective he actively embraces and one I reject. If he really is the socialist he says he is, I worry about his end state goals because I do not support the economic end state goals of socialism or social democratism in the slightest. 



I would prefer a candidate more in line with Clinton's third way approach. 




 It does not boil down to this specific legislation, it is the outlook of socialist economic policy. I just don't think I am comfortable supporting someone whose economic outlook is that far left. 




 First, that is the very definition of a socialist, which he identifies as.


Second, [here is where he actually presented legislation supporting it.](http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/worker-owned-businesses-2014) 




 Mostly socialist insistence on worker control of means of production. My outlook on economic issues varies from his, I support a freer economy with a strong federal infrastructure. 



That being said, I don't hate Sanders. I totally support his stance on civil liberty, marriage equality, foreign policy etc. I will also add that Vermont has some of the most lax gun laws in the nation, which I support as a second amendment loving Democrat (who said deep blue states have to hate guns?) 


I just don't know if I would support him over Rand, who has pretty identical views on civil liberty, foreign policy, and the like but an economic outlook I am more comfortable with.  




 Socialism's main goal is worker control of the means of production.


Progressivism is a philosophy pursuing a mixed market  "third way" economy.



There are some pretty strong differences between the two. I am neither a socialist or progressive though. 




 Registered Democrat. I align more with Blue Dogs/New Democrats.  




 Rand is not Ron. I don't believe he would destroy welfare, state education, the IRS etc. His goals are more geared towards dismantling the NSA's power, hopefully supporting marijuana legalization, and other civil liberties.


 




 Yes, I would vote for Rand over Hillary.



I would not vote for any other republicans, they are all GOP establishment  




 [Yes](http://nypost.com/2015/04/28/bernie-sanders-to-run-for-president-as-democrat/) 




 So in your opinion the only true populism is one in which the party "for the people" remains exclusively revolutionary?  




 Yes, I would vote for Rand Paul. 




 In what way? What information? 




 Depends which Republican.  




 Because I am not that far left. I am a moderate/centrist Democrat. Believe it or not [less than half of Democrats identify as "liberal"](http://www.gallup.com/poll/180452/liberals-record-trail-conservatives.aspx).


Not all of us are as progressive as Sanders. 




 Do you view the rise of Syriza in Greece as a good thing, or negative thing for Socialism?


What about the rise of Left Wing Populism of parties like the Citizens Movement in Mexico, and even candidates like Bernie Sanders running for the U.S. presidency as an open Left Wing Populist? 














 I am an Alabama resident currently stationed in NY. So much for Republicans sticking up for Servicemembers. 




 Mine would be Jim Webb, though I know it is next to impossible. As a Veteran, I respect his service immensely, his Centrism aligns with mine, his proven record as senator  and Secretary of the Navy. I think he would make a phenomenal President. 









 No, I did not 




 80% Democrat, 37% republican 




 A government that does not spy on me, start useless wars, and does not infringe on my civil liberties 




 Are the blue dogs still around? 




 Ok.. I didn't come here to argue about gun control. I do not mind background checks, but I oppose legislation that tries to ban guns and magazine size. 




 Yes, I am a Sanders fan myself. But isn't he an independent? 




 I used to be a moderate republican with some libertarian leanings. I have just gotten to the point where they have totally ran away from me. I have voted Democrat in the past, and am thinking about becoming a registered Democrat. I thought I would ask for advice finding a place in this party.



I support civil liberties totally. I support drug decriminalization, marajuana legalization, and marriage equality. I support drastic immigration  reform. I consider myself a Square Deal Democrat. I advocate for total transparency  in government, demilitarization of police forces, prison reform, and an end to mandatory minimum sentencing. 



On the other hand, there are a few issues I worry would put me at odds with the Democratic party. I do not support gun control. I generally prefer the state to stay out of the markets (though I am a not a rabid welfare hater or anything). 


What do you say? Am I at odds with the party? Are there any factions/caucuses or anything that I might be able to connect with? 




 Has anyone heard of other vets joining Americorps? I know many volunteers are fresh out of college. I have been in war, been shot at, done Army stuff, but I am looking for a new way to connect with the world and serve. Would I be out of place amongst other volunteers? Would my services put me at an advantage? I would really prefer volunteering in urban areas affected by heavy gang violence, or something that can really use my skills is there something like that? 




 Has anyone heard of other vets joining the peace corps? I know many volunteers are fresh out of college. I have been in war, been shot at, done Army stuff, but I am looking for a new way to connect with the world and serve. Would I be out of place amongst other volunteers? Would my services put me at an advantage? 




 Are you comfortable with the state of human rights within U.S. prisons?

 




 Incredible, but sad discovery. 














 I don't believe in a 1984 media conspiracy, but I believe most of the media is bent way beyond any hope of objectivity. The media is controlled by vapid and sensationalist western culture. This is why guys like Hannity, Bill O'Reilly, The Reid Report etc exist. 


I tend to get my news from NPR, Reuters, and BBC. 




 1. What  do you see as the ideal endstate of prison reform (how would you like to see the U.S. justice system ideally operate)?



2. What realistic steps would you like to see taken now to reform the prison system?

2. What events caused Texas to declare independence from Mexico?

3. Were there many in Texas who remained loyal to Mexico? (Like the Tories in the American Revolution)

 Not all Muslims do those things, Islamic Extremists do. Just like Christian extremists during the Holy Roman empire murdered thousands of "barbarians" at the sword for not converting, Mormon extremists took child brides (statutory rape), Japanese nationalist extremists killed themselves in Kamikaze strikes at Pearl Harbor. 


Extremism takes on many forms. Blanketing an entire demographic with the actions of a few nut jobs is unfair and unAmerican.
