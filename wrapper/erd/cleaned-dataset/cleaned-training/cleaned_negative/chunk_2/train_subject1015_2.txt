 Hi all, 28yo here. The small company I work for is rolling out pensions on 1 February (where they match our contribs to a certain figure still TBC). A recent windfall means I also have 10,000 to put into this in some form, but would it be better invested in an ISA instead of sticking it in what I can only assume will be a fairly standard pension? As background, I already own a home and have some money tucked away as emergency funds. 






























































































 Assuming, that is, it will work with current Wii U consoles. Intrigued to hear your thoughts, and if you think Nintendo would ever sell it separately at all. 
























 This is like a Clockwork Orange scenario, you can't just not watch movies anymore or They will tie you up and force you to. So which do you go for?
