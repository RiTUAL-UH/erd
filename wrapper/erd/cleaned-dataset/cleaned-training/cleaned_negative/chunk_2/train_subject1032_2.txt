 I use to be the same way. I always looked forward to sleeping right after school just so I can escape and enjoy my dreams. That was one of my highlights of my day. 
It's all on the people you meet and befriend, it's crazy how one person can change what you look forward to. 




 I have the same thing happening to me. I try to do what draken273 mention and detach myself but, its a hard thing for me to do when you keep thinking of being able to please this new SO. Foreplay is a must and just try switching up. If you're feeling like you're about to get there, stop and concentrate on other areas of your SO: lick her nipple, grab her breast and kiss the neck. Just think of finding a way to stop and compose yourself without your SO losing her momentum. 

That's what I have to offer as advice but, I also think it's all in your head. With me and my Ex we went at it for I would say average length 20-30min. But know that I'm with this new person I keep thinking about being able to please her and it just affects me negatively. For my situation at least, I think I just need to get that thought out of my head and just be in the moment; not worrying whether or not I'm going to last long. 

Hope you find something that helps, and don't forget to add updates for others 




 That was really awesome and inspiring just seeing a group of people showing up to help.  




 Anyone else wondering if those pens are purchaseable......? 




 thanks for the link, the other songs were badass as well! 
Got a bit saddened when I saw that they're from Italy. Small chance of being able to see them play :( hahaha 




 That was an excellent post! Glad to have found something different that is actually good. Really random but the song was pretty sick!  




 I feel dumb for doubting the initial sound. The song was awesomely chill, going to look up more, thanks for posting this!
