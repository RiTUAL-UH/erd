 Does anyone have any DIY plans? Can I use a kerosene-driven motor? (We're off grid.)

I figure I can salvage an old refrigerator by cutting a hole in the top for his head and then sealing the gap around his neck with rubber from salvaged retreads (along with duct tape to make a good, tight pressure seal.)

Also, is it feasible to combine this setup with a composting toilet? If I can avoid opening the fridge door more than once a year or so to hose out his filth, I'd *really* like to avoid it. (I'm very self-reliant and it is going to be a *real* pain to aim the hose with one hand while manually pumping his oxygen bag with the other, especially with him hanging there by his neck/head like a baseball bat hanging in a rack.)

To be frank this is a **lot** more hassle than an rugged individual like myself is used to. What I really need are Volunteerists to preserve this young man's life. If you *insist* on compensation, I can throw a few Bitcoins your way once in a while. 

















































 Does the Castle Doctrine apply? Should I "Stand My Ground"? Can I blow her away? 

 


































 Ted in 1977, to *High Times* magazine:

"I got my physical notice 30 days prior to. Well, on that day I ceased cleansing my body. No more brushing my teeth, no more washing my hair, no baths, no soap, no water. Thirty days of debris build. I stopped shavin and I was 18, had a little scraggly beard, really looked like a hippie. I had long hair, and it started gettin kinky, matted up. Then two weeks before, I stopped eating any food with nutritional value. I just had chips, Pepsi, beer-stuff I never touched-buttered poop, little jars of Polish sausages, and Id drink the syrup, I was this side of death, Then a week before, I stopped going to the bathroom. I did it in my pants. poop, piss the whole shot. My pants got crusted up."

Ted in 2013, to the media at a Las Vegas Gun Show: 

"But here is what is wrong with America today. We have a president, and everybody better write this down, and memorize this. The president of the United States goes to the Vietnam Memorial Wall and pretends to honor 58,000 American heroes who died fighting communism and then he hires, appoints and associates with communists. He pretends to pay honor to men who died fighting communism, and then he hangs out with, hires and appoints communists. He is an evil dangerous man who hates America and hates freedom. And we need to fix this as soon as possible."
 




 2013: The Year of Linux on the Desktop. 














 Just wondering. 



















 Once or twice a day . . . well, you know.

Also a fair amount of unexplained beachballing.

Any suggestions? 


































 Because they are the only time Ron Paul has been truly honest about what he believes. 




 What are your sincere opinions on the "Tea Party," End-Timer Evangelicals, and the general "if lib'ruls is fer it, I'm 'gainst it" Archie Bunker-types that have come to dominate/define the Party?

Do you have any reasonable hope/chance of reclaiming the Party, or will it require a major political realignment for any sort of sensible, reasonable Conservatism to take hold?

 They seem to lose all interest in children post-birth, to say nothing of their persistent contempt for the mothers.

Why? Is it similar to the fetishization of puppies and kittens, which often mutates into the neglect and dispossession of millions of dogs and cats?

What happens to the "Respecting a Culture of Life^TM" crowd after "God's Littlest Angels^TM" are launched into a world of neglect and abuse that these "pro-lifers" have created for them with their toxic, regressive politics? 









 ***RESIGN THE NRA.***

 Was everyone able to get along, or did your crazy right-wing relatives roll out the bizarre conspiracy theories?  














 I wonder if it's because I posted this?

 I'd love to see this shitware driven from the face of the Earth. Can I safely ignore it, or is it a valid "security update"?

Better yet, can I delete Adobe Flash entirely from my Mac? Any special steps? Since we're in an HTML 5 world now, I don't see the point of even having it.

Thanks in advance 

















































 Bloggers would report the strange, disturbing, morbid and often profane search strings that searchers had used which led to their webpages.



Is there any current equivalent? 





























 They just don't get that they've violated the "Non-Spamggression Principle."

If they had just left everyone on the Internet alone and gone about their own business, everything would have been just fine.

But after millions and millions and millions more of provacative, deliberate, and direct violations of the "Non-Spamggression Principle," they forced our hand. A man can only take so much Spamggression before he stands up for himself and fights the PaulSpam Machine.

We're just defending ourselves.

 WHOO-HOO!!!

Many of you are on the road to Tampa right now! Let's see your pictures! Post links to your blogs! (Starbucks and McDonald's have free Wi-Fi so you can check in from the road.)

How many vehicles are in your Ronvoy? I hope you all brought your signs and are posing for lots of pictures at roadside attractions to spread the message of Liberty!

Can't wait to see you all! Where is everyone staying? Tell us your stories! 




 If I wanted to/were available to talk, I would have called rather than texted.

Why do people insist on doing this? 









 Goodbye Florida. 









 Once the seniors of Florida find out about Paul Ryan's plans to dismantle Social Security and Medicare, it's even more over for Mitt than it was before. 









 Please post where you're from and how you'll be getting to Tampa (plane, bus, Ronvoy, car, etc.)

If you're going by car, some of you may be on the road already. Are you keeping a blog of your travels? If not, start! Post links here so we can all see them!

 




 After all, Hitler's followers were able to successfully plan and carry out rallies in support of their candidate.  




 Are people getting excited out there?

This event has so much potential to make the Liberty Movement even more well-known. Thank you Dr. Paul for making it all possible! 









 Does anyone know the new shortcut? 




 The Libertarians should form an alliance with the Church of Scientology and get SEA ORG on the job. 




 Have you bought your tickets? How are you getting there? The lineup of bands and speakers looks pretty awesome. Are there any hotels offering special Paul Festival rates? 




 Was it when you learned of the Ron Paul Newsletters?

Was it the Moneybombs begging you for your "worthless fiat currency" rather than gold?

Was it when you realized he'd been a longtime compatriot of American White Nationalists?

Please share your stories.

 It's been almost a year since Perry organized "the Response" to beg God for rain in Texas.

Is he going to do it again? 




 Just as Bill Clinton distanced himself from the "Jesse Jackson" wing of the Democratic Party by criticizing Sister Souljah's Black Nationalist lyrics, Mitt Romney's criticism of "ObamaCare" [a deliberate, derisive term the American Right has sought to implant as strongly negative in America's id] was designed to get the NAACP booing at him, thus strengthening the resolve of his own Party's Obama-haters. This will get Mitt Romney donations and volunteers, as well as convey a much wider message.

The Republican dog-whistle: "if *those people* think 'ObamaCare' is good, *you* should hate it, because *'morbidly obese welfare queens in new Cadillacs with 8 kids with 8 different fathers buying vodka at the liquor store with Food Stamps'*."

Just think how many thousands of times Fox News and American Right SuperPACs will run this from this moment up until the election, reference it in their blogs, and AM-spam it 24 hours a day. Look at what they did with the "New Black Panthers" clip, for example.

To deny that this was a calculated move on the Romney campaign's part would be as foolish as denying that Bill Clinton's "Sister Souljah" speech was meant to clearly separate the modern Democratic Party from any association with the rhetoric of the Extremist Left of the late 1960s. (It's important to note that most people had never heard of Sister Souljah before, or since.) Both were messages sent out to/clearly received by their respective intended multiple audiences.

 It's a shame they have ***ZERO*** regard for mothers and their children *post-birth* as they do in dictating their radical belief that blastocysts are sentient beings.

Nonetheless, there are a lot of good, honest, sincere Republicans out there. If any of them are reading and would care to address this, we'd all really like to know.
