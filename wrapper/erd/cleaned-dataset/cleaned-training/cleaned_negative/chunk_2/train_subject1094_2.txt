 Sorry about that! Deleting the story. It worked on my Google news page and actually still does.

 You're right. However, most people I know, friends and family have bought houses close to work or/and in good neighborhoods. I don't think we in Holland have adopted the American way of buying a house an hour or 2 away from where we work. Also, from my understanding and I could be wrong here, there are a lot of houses for sale in undesirable neighborhoods.

So, I think we the Dutch choose to pay more and thus compete for scarce property.

EDIT: Here is some data from the Dutch Association of Real Estate Agents http://www.globalpropertyguide.com/Europe/Netherlands/Price-History


    In 2008, house prices fell by 5.3% (-7.5% in real terms)
    In 2009, house prices dropped by 1.5% (-2.4% in real terms)
    In 2010, house prices rose slightly by 1% (-0.7% in real terms)
    In 2011, house prices dropped by 3.8% (-6.2% in real terms)

As you can see, the drop per year is not really dramatic percentage wise. 




 Just an FYI: The title of this article was changed after I submitted the story. I took a screenshot from Google search showing the old title http://imgur.com/1l9h34R. 




 Houses are scarce in The Netherlands and the pressure on prices has mostly been upward which is what keeps the house prices from tumbling rapidly. The cost of buying a house eats up a large proportion of income for an average Dutch citizen which is part of living in the Netherlands.

Volkskrant did a story about the Dutch economy. Here is the English version of it "10 misconceptions about the Dutch economy" http://www.dutchnews.nl/features/2013/08/volkskrant_10_misconceptions_a.php 




 If the U.N. confirms the Syrian regimes use of chemical weapons, there are better ways for the U.S., U.K. and their allies to respond instead of bombardment, which would likely kill more non-combatants as we've seen so many times in Iraq and Afghanistan.

 Thanks for explaining. The article also mentions the women kicking the officer in the face and biting him several times. 

we saw the woman kick a police officer in the face [the officer also said the woman bit him several times, and tried to grab his portable radio to stop him from calling backup 




 I don't speak French but from the story:

I was shocked to hear the policeman saying This is bullshit  its always the same ones. They then put handcuffs on the first woman and left her lying in the street for several minutes. When another police car arrived to take those arrested away, he yelled at her again: Shut your trap, you bitch.

I guess its about racism and unorthodox police language/behavior?

Title: Revelations about the French Big Brother

Article (it's behind a paywall for those who desire to read the full story):

If the revelations about the U.S. spying program Prism led a chorus of indignation in Europe, France, she did minor quibbles. For two good reasons: Paris already knew. And does the same thing.

The World is able to prove that the Directorate General for External Security (DGSE, special services) systematically collect electromagnetic signals from computers or phones in France, as well as flows between French and abroad: all our communications are spied. All e-mails, text messages, telephone records, access to Facebook, Twitter, are then stored for years.

If this huge database was used by the DGSE who officiates as outside French borders, the case is already illegal. But six other intelligence services, including the Central Directorate of Internal Intelligence (DCRI), customs or Tracfin service fight against money laundering, including the data that draw interest daily. Discreetly on the sidelines of the legality and beyond serious control. Political know perfectly, but the secret is the rule.

This French Big Brother, brother of U.S. services is illegal. However, its existence appears di ...

 Valid point. He answers that in the article:

Sang has no illusions that even a clever cryptographic fontwhich you can use in email messages to shield them from snoops and font-recognition botswill remain encoded for long. They're not meant to be long-term tools with which to combat the NSA. Rather, he views them as an awareness-raising measure.

"This project will not fully solve the problems we are facing now," he writes, " but hopefully will raise some peculiar questions."

 Due to work I travel often to Romania. I personally haven't seen any harm from them nor do I really understand why some hate them. Speaking of gypsy houses, I visited a village which has some insane huge palaces of which all belonged to gypsies. The NYT has a nice slideshow of it http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/04/kings-of-the-roma/

 I just can't fathom the idea of Man United without Sir Alex. I and a whole generation of football fans grow up with him. The game and Man United will never be the same for me ;(

Thank you for everything, Sir. 




 Yes, sir. A Man United supporter born and bred but always loved the Blaugrana. 




 Looking forward to it! Hoping for a good result tonight too. 




 Disgraceful. It's a shame a good player like him has very little moral. 




 Excellent job lads. Thank you! 




 Thanks, pylori.

I totally agree. Thanks to you guys, /r/science is a better place. I know us submitters should be more cautious but sometimes like the Moore's law story it's confusing.

Have a good day! 




 Sorry about that pylori! I did check the .pdf paper before submitting but there was no date on it so I assumed the 28th of March 2013 (http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.3381) was the publication date.

Thanks for looking into it! 




 Sorry about that! deleting this one.
