 I'm puzzled too. It was at +10 one second. The next it was at -14. Either way, I'll happily take the downvotes on behalf of /r/motorcycles. I don't know a single rider that isn't extremely cautious with their driving. I ride to avoid traffic, but I also ride for the exhileration. At no time do I mesh those two desires. If I want to satisfy my craving for [power](http://www.instantclarkson.com/) I go to a long stretch of empty road near the airport where I live. I even dated a girl that loved the whole motorcycle thing and pissed her off every time she rode with me because she wanted to go fast and I refused.  




 Spot on. I've had a handful of crashes, all but one of them have been because of someone else in a car. The one that wasn't, I ran over a nail that popped my tyre. I've got a theory that a lot of road accidents could be avoided by less restrictive speed limits, and the same logic applies to riding vs driving. In a car it's easy to switch off because of the feeling of security a car provides. If you're on a bike, you're acutely aware that you could go flying 50 feet in the air and land in a ditch if anyone makes a wrong move. Now who is going to be the more cautious driver? 




 On behalf of bikers everywhere, we know. The last thing the majority of riders need is a lecture on their own mortality. The majority of us are respectful and safe.  




 My ex's exes were a Rockefeller and pro basketball player. Jokes on them though, because I'm the one she fell in love with. Until she became a lesbian and broke up with me 




 Holy shit this is so true

 Fuck me, people remember trig? I took it for two years and there isn't a snowball's chance in my ass I could do this.  




 IIRC the russians conducted training drills down there during the cold war. Seems like it might be just an attempt to show the US Russia can have major influence within their immediate neighbourhood.  




 The way he just lets the natural momentum of his jump carry him back around when he realizes the shot is delayed... he's not just athletic, he's fucking smart. At least in that sense. Not everyone would have the presence of mind to do that.

 Yeah, that's what really confused me. I've never been self conscious but I sure as shit never thought ol' Reptar was anything to write home about. Can only assume she was a size queen.

 As someone who had a one night stand recently with a girl who said "Oh, I heard it was bigger", that shit stings. I'm not even small, but that's a surefire way to give a dude a complex where there wasn't one before. 




 That's really interesting. I'm guessing the principal is that by not trying to make the software perfect, you get it out early and keep developing it from there? 




 Yessssss. Exactly. Although as a former court reporter I might point out that it's not really tip-toe language, it's just factual. And while libel is a concern, media oversight groups are the main concern. I'd have seriously put my job in danger if I didn't use the proper language.

 I get why I'm being downvoted, but I was just pointing out that you don't have to be rich to sleep with people from around the world. My m'stake.  




 What is the historical context? 




 Giving up that karma would be... criminal 




 I feel so bad for laughing but fuck that was funny. 




 And I don't care that you think it doesn't deserve to be there. The whole point of reddit is that the users decide what is good content and what is not. Downvote and be on your merry way. I'll upvote and do the same.  




 Your mastery of sarcasm blows my mind. Look out Cicero! Where did you learn to use such a rhetorical device?

Your ebullient use of the English language aside, my point was that it was clearly not the most amazing content, but the story behind it connected with me in a way that I could appreciate.

Could it be that the things people find interesting differs wildly between individuals? 




 I was more thinking of the post where OP used his dead father's last fiver to get a beer when he was legal. It was just a picture of a beer and a fiver, but as someone who lost their father as a teen, I appreciated the post. Begging for donations is different. 




 Unless that girl was Elle Woods. Then she'd dump your candy ass. 




 Wait. I thought this was photoshopped. Is it not? 




 Nothing humble about it, except I can't afford to go any of those place. 




 I've dealt with an unfair amount of tragedy in my 27 years. Don't have a problem with this at all. Whatever helps.  




 Was in an emotionally abusive relationship for a while. Got out of it when I realized things weren't getting better. Turned out the entire time we were dating she was living undiagnosed with MS, which played a big part in her craziness level. Anyways, this won't be a popular opinion, but I think it takes a particularly weak person to internalise the emotional abuse they're getting. Both men and women. I couldn't ever take a word she said seriously because she was so clearly trying to say the most hurtful thing she could imagine. Why would you give a person like that the time of day? Why let their comments affect you? It never made sense to me.  




 I dunno, living in a major tourist destination, I could probably make my way around europe and america crashing on the couches of girls I've hooked up with. Tourists love the local boys.  




 Need a sauce on that please. 




 I definitely know that hair and booty. 




 I've heard that joke. Seriously en pointe.  




 Looks like a Palace fan, in which case I'm sure she'll be a lot more happy in about 28 minutes.  




 what the fuck has happened in the last few weeks? why is shit like this making the front page now?  




 I take it you're not the safe guy. 




 Calling him a journalist is doing him way too many favours. He writes about games. Call me when he's writing about gaming in South Sudan.... 









 An ex of mine did a photo project similar to this. After three years of taking intimate photographs, a junkie isn't going to care if she's there when they start fucking. A bit ethically grey to me, but that's why I stick to words not pictures.

 Drug treatment courts for non violent drug offenders are some of the most effective courts in the world. Their recidivism rates are miniscule. The entire drug court team knows who really needs it, and who is trying to use them to get out of jail time. They spend a lot of time and effort making sure they aren't being played.

 Ghost Kitty is our nickname for the stray we found stowed away in our car engine. Our last name is Stevenson, so naturally we named him Yusuph Islam, the artist formerly known as Cat Stevenson.  




 If you're having content problems I feel bad for you son, I got 99 problems but reposting ain't one.  




 Building a stadium that gives your team an advantage over the visitor is standard practice among most sports. A lot more of the new stadiums in English football do this, not to mention everything they do with the pitch to get an advantage. Also, it's not against the rules. You can't get busted for smoking weed then point out the guy that's drunk and say what he's doing is worse. 




 Probably because their shitty O-Line ruined what could have been a top 5 QB 




 This is pretty common practice in a lot of sports. Wembley Stadium in particular. Playing fake crowd noise is not. 




 Technically according to [cat law](https://youtu.be/WGEGy21Yk9U?t=45s) you're right. The apartment is his now. But cat law differs slightly to human law. Kinda like bird law.  




 Why did he have to wait?

I don't think it's that incredible he advanced through the ranks. I'm pretty cynical about most things, but I find it very hard to imagine the American military has come to a point where valour is no longer a core value. 




 I'm ashamed to admit I got the year wrong, and somehow forgot about Palace making Suarez cry. My LFC Hater badge will be on the desk in the morning.  




 Shit. Of course it's that match. That would explain why I spotted this. I watched it at least five times out of pure schadenfreude.  




 I kiiiinda checked, but I'm about as confident as Rhodri Giggs at a family reunion. The only match between the two sides I came across in 2014, the score was 1-2. The 2013 fixture ended 3-1. 




 Fair. But I was thinking in terms of content and the reddit community as a whole. Google+ and Facebook users don't get a goddamn fucking ridiculous doge meme on a NASCAR, then it into the All Star Race. It's shit like THAT that keeps me here. I lost it seeing that goddamn doge car, and I don't want that kind of stuff to stop happening.  




 Yeah, it's way too friendly. She's putting up fliers though.

 I think Reddit is far past masquerading as anything other than what it is: the most influential website in the world. This happens with a lot of cultural movements, of which Reddit can certainly qualify. They start out with upstanding value systems that people gravitate toward. But the more people gravitate, the harder it becomes to uphold those ideals. Reddit gets more and more popular, requiring more and more money. In order to keep making that money to service the users, values are sacrificed. Goes for political parties, religions, you name it. I'm disappointed but wholly unsurprised. 




 This is my friend's business! Big up Evan! 




 Sorry, but no. Boston. 




 I dont know of many F1 drivers that haven't practiced from an early age.... 




 Thanks. Definitely going on my letter to Santa.  




 Bermuda, the land of pastel shorts, pink beaches, and nonexistent triangles.

That's pretty much what I had in mind. This is in the far off future, mind you. There's no way I could afford flying out to a driving school any time soon. 




 No, unfortunately. Her apt complex doesn't allow pets :( 




 THAT I can understand. Obligatory brush with death story:

 My days riding 50cc scramblers saved my life a few years back. I was going too fast around a blind corner and there was a van parked in the road. I swerved to avoid it but another car was coming in the opposite direction. I hit the brakes hard, locking up my rear which put the bike sideways, skidding straight toward the car. The moment I realized I was going to hit it head on, I let go of the rear brake and the bike popped up and straightened out, grazing the driver's side of the car and sparing my life. 




 Oh dear god no. Definitely not planning on jumping straight into an F1 car. I want to take a proper course and everything. And yes, I drive every day, but only ever under 60kph in beat up Opel Astra. Doesn't exactly hone your driving sense.  




 Unfortunately not. I live on a 21 square mile island where the speed limit is 50kph. Having a burp in an F1 car is high up on my bucket list though. I'm dying to know if I have the balls to give it some real welly.  




 Alonso might disagree there. Or Stirling Moss........ 




 That makes a lot of sense. Sounds similar to MotoGp. I guess what's tripping me up is just a general lack of knowledge for how it feels going fast on four wheels. I've always gotten my kicks on two.  




 I feel like that's probably a good thing. I've only ever seen a fedora worn well in magazines.  




 ? am I missing something? 









 Looks like he's about to dingle his dangle on the rim... 




 I used to be SUPER into swords as a kid. Went to Toledo for them and everything. I still fucking love swords, but man oh man have neckbeards ruined them for me. 




 mother of god. what tard kard put this report together? 




 Journalist here. Same thing applies, although it's not so much crying over really horrific shit, more the slow, painful realization as you slip deeper into the rabbit hole of life that nothing is going to change, and there's nothing you can do about it. That said, we do see some pretty awful road fatalities. I didn't think journalism would teach me what a kneecap looks like. 




 They were actually the OG truthers. Well, them and the sinking of the Maine. We've just forgotten about that particular conspiracy theory. 




 Exactly. I never understood this about fans wanting athletes to be upstanding moral paragons of sportsmanship. Players dive. They flop. They do anything they can to win. It's up to the people making the rules to ensure the integrity of the game is maintained despite this.  




 I mean... That's kinda exactly how America started

 Ya'll need to learn how to bullshit better if you're typing single words in at the end of sentences. Wow. 




 Ooooooooh dat thudding doe. Jesus.  




 It got a decent "heh" out of me. 




 There is a huge fucking difference. Words are just a fraction of the ways we communicate. 




 I'm the same way. I saw a thread about a guy wanting to commit suicide the other day and my first instinct was: "What a cunt, posting that online. I should go tell him to do it". I didn't, but I still wanted to... that's disturbing to me 




 Can confirm.

 If you'd like to boil it down to which measurement is used the most, I'd be willing to bet the entire trade and commerce industry might beat out the average number of Americans.  




 Now you just need to have JJ block a field goal... Good luck 




 Remind me how a few movie stars worth millions of dollars asking for my money to make another movie is important? 




 Fun fact: the "official" system of measurement in the US is actually metric.

EDIT for clarity: the metric system is "the Preferred system of weights and measures for United States trade and commerce". 




 The fact that she, armed with only a bachelor's degree in early childhood education, took over an entire magazine when her husband died suddenly, and not only kept the business afloat but managed to cut all our debt, rebrand the magazine, launch four more magazines, publish 12 books, find the most awesome, caring, creative man to love, and raise two kids all at the same time. She also rips mad bongs. Mom's an OG4Lyf.
