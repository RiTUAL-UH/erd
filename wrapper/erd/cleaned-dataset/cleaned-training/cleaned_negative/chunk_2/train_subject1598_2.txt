 I can't speak for TFA, but it's UK-version Teach First, found that its teachers on average remained in teaching slightly longer than those who had taken a traditional route to teaching (there is a very high rate of teachers quitting on conventional training as well).

 I used to ask students to take notes on 4 pages of a textbook in 10 minutes.
After 10 minutes they must close the text book and use their notes to answer some questions.
Then I would give some notes I took which are "model notes" so they can see how to write briefly but clearly.

 Nice story 




 Activists have been breaking into anial labs and stealing animals. Politicians seem reluctant to step in, instead moving science policy away from animal research. Researchers had a rally to try and explain to the public the importance of such research. 

Pro-Test Italia ran the rally on a shoestring rally, and from what I've spoken to them, received no money from any pharmaceutical or university 









 This one?

 Good story!

 Didn't Lord Prof Winston suggest labelling all medicine (in the UK) with "has been tested on animals".

 It's derived from Crowley's paper stating only 0.004% of research has clinical use. 




 So parents who are more skeptical of modern medicine are also more skeptical of all proper medicine? No surprise. 




 True. Here's an online version of Crick and Watson: http://www.nature.com/nature/dna50/watsoncrick.pdf 




 Is there a similar paper that's more recent?

 So people like Andrew Wakefield should be able to make up stats to put in the discussion about the benefits of vaccination? Those falsehoods killed people. 














 It's another myth that's done its rounds - so definitely right to be skeptical 














 That is a ridiculous video. It takes footage from what looks to be 30-40 years ago. The video says clinical investigation is "the ONLY valid kind" - how exactly are you going to discover the patterns of disease, or which treatment works without clear large number of very similar patients and control groups (so as to have scientific rigour).

"Any disease which is provoked is unlike any disease which arrives spontaneously". WHAT?! We have treated many diseases successfully by creating models - that is the principle of biological science.

There are so many factual errors throughout that video 




 Their claim personalised medicine will replace animal experiments
Their claim that animal research is non-predictive
Their claim that human and veterinary medicine are unconnected

All pseudoscientific nonsense, and the post deals with most of those points. 




 The mouse study is interesting. It does show significant failings of mouse models for three conditions. It's a good peer reviewed paper. 
Note the paper doesn't suggest to stop using animals, it says we need to improve the models. Read this specific reply to the paper in question:

 teklord - you should visit a lab. They are not like the 70s videos you watch online. They are not tortured, research is always done under anaesthetic unless there is a VERY clear reason why this shouldn't be the case (usually because the procedure itself is milder than the anaesthetic injection, such as a blood draw or a breeding experiment).

And what is a failed experiment? If something doesn't work, you learn something, modify your actions, and try again.

In terms of enslaving humans you should read this: http://speakingofresearch.com/2011/12/06/the-gorgons-visit-earth/ 









 The article you sight shows limitations of some animal models - it also suggests these models are improved not binned. See this article: http://speakingofresearch.com/2013/02/15/why-mice-may-succeed-in-research-when-a-single-mouse-falls-short/ 




 The computer models generally come from the animals. When computer models improve it is because of animal research - so they are unlikely to replace animal models but rather to complement it.

No model is perfect (I am not a perfect biological model for you), but we use a variety of techniques in tandem (including in vitro, computer models, DNA chips, human skin cells, (etc) AND animal models) to get the best results. 




 Also note that Vioxx passed human clinical trials to show it was safe. Yes it passed animal trials (which were much smaller than the subsequent human trials which is why they were less likely to show the side effect which affected around 1 in 400 patients), but it also passed human trials. It is the exception to the rule where a dangerous drug makes it through all tests (incidentally these would have included in vitro and computer models). 




 What on earth makes you think most are killed instantly. A mouse might be hit by a stone knocked by a thresher, or might get just its leg hit by the blade. It crawls underground and waits to die - no anaesthetic (mandatory unless special reasons not to in most western labs), no food, no water, no safety 




 The original papers dealing with aspirin and birth defects rabbits involved huge overdoses of aspirin to rabbits (1). The same is likely to be the same with humans (humans can certainly overdose on aspirin), with some anecdotal evidence (2), but large scale studies would not be ethical.

 The article isn't an argument for animal research - it was never intentioned as such - this is why it doesn't have any arguments for research in it. It's about the relationship between animal-use movements.

In regards to your argument:
- No billions of animals are not bought yearly. It is likely to number about 100 million (that's the estimate from animal rights groups). 
- I can't talk for research in lesser developed countries, but in the US and EU research can only take place when the researcher can show there was no other method that would work and that the benefit outweighs the cost - so not "pointless experimentation". 
- Our genetic differences are far overwhelmed by our genetic similarities. This can be even closer when you look at genetically modified mice which have humanised genes. You should also note that humans are not genetically identical (far from it) yet you would not argue that human tests work. 
- Human skin cultures are a brilliant development and are widely used - but cannot tell you about how organs react, or how drugs move through the body, or their mechanisms of action - they are limited and are used alongside animal experiments.

 What a skewed title here. All they say is that 9% use animals from the same litter. They point out this would be better. So 91% could have potential flaws, that doesn't mean 91% of studies are flawed. 




 Anyone know more about the research on horses? 




 how so? 









 The difference being that continuing to use the product of knowledge from the holocaust doesn't perpetuate such research. Continuing to use the benefits of animal research does.
