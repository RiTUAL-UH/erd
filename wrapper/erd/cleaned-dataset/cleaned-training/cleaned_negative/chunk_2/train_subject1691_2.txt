 Prismarine pillars?! Redstone lamps with different colors/textures? Who knows. :D 




 I really like your use of regular torches! I find they're hard to use in an aesthetically pleasing way, especially without any addition (such as a frame and a slab behind). But you did a really nice job there. Nice! 




 Yeah. Ocean Monument blocks (especially dark prismarine) work fine with nether blocks I find. Just like sand and nether blocks work well together. Just like prismarine blocks work well with sand.  It all works together in the end I guess. :D 




 Yeah. I wish this picture was the one in the OP haha but it's fine, I don't think redstone lamps mix in that poorly either. Lanterns are just a superior choice.  




 This is a squid farm though:D 




 Nice! 




 Whoa! Nice haha! I'm not sure what else to say...

edit: Prismarine pillars? Redstone lamps of different textures/colors? :D Who knows! 




 Saved. Thanks for this.  









 I feel like shit when I don't lift, but I understand how important rest is, so I endure how I feel. I also feel like shit when I don't eat clean, which is fine because eating clean should be a 7 day thing and you won't go very far if your diet is only on point during your training days.  




 I've lost a total of over 200 pounds across 6 years. From 30% body fat when I was 15 year old to close to 10% now. I know how to lose weight. But I constantly look for ways of making the process easier and faster.  




 It improves mood and suppresses appetite. Makes it easier to diet.  




 [Indeed.](http://i.imgur.com/C9rtUKE.png) 




 I haven't been able to find any studies on the interaction between the two, but since 5-HTP increases the production of available serotonin in the brain and Ephedrine is an agonist at the serotonin receptors, could combining the two be potentially dangerous?  




 Indeed! 




 Have at least a good understanding of basic biochemical principles. If you want to understand the science behind dieting for specific purposes (such as reducing adipose tissue), you have to understand how macro and micro nutrients are processed by the body, that is, how they interact with various enzymes and hormones.  




 Read the FAQ/Wiki.  




 Has anyone ever tried this product? I hear it helps for cutting due to its properties as a mood regulator and appetite suppressant.  









 I can see the difference instantly, personally. A fit butt looks firm and almost 'peaky', whereas a fat butt just looks like a bit fat slump of adipose tissue and it spreads around the hips as well.  I think a fit butt is really attractive, whereas one that is just fat is ugly. Perhaps it has to do with the person's corresponding lifestyle more than anything. My friends think the latter is attractive too, I think they have issues...  




 Assuming weight lifting and proper protein intake, most of what you lose is triglycerides. The fat cells release their content, these are bound to lipoproteins, released into the bloodstream, and then used to create energy through lipolysis and then the metabolic pathway.  




 Nice! 




 Nah. It looks awful with light. Relative darkness is what makes it look decent.  









 For example, when I'm cooking salmon, I'll say 'I'm preparing some proteins and some saturated and omega-3 fats'. 

Or if I'm eating raspberries, I'll say 'I'm having fibers and sugars with some Vitamin K and Magnesium'.

I'm not kidding. Do others people do that or am I just a weird human being?  




 Fixed that typo! Thanks.  




 I play Minecraft. It kills time.  




 I'm not sure. I was careless and wrote this without verifying any source material. I'll remove it just in case, I would rather be less precise than give incorrect information.  




 As far as I know, albumins are water-soluble proteins that bind fatty acids. But I don't have a source to check at the moment, so I could be wrong. Also, I'm sorry, I often mix up lipogenesis and lipolysis (the two terms, not the process that each term refers to). Lipogenesis, rather, is the process by which acetyl coA is converted to fatty acids and triglycerides, just to clarify for others who will read this.  




 I personally avoid Questbars. They claim to be fiber rich, however the fiber they contain are isomalto-oligosaccharides, which I call fake fibers because they are a sugar that isn't actually considered one due to the fact that it is a long chain molecule, but which still has the same impact as sugar on the brain. Also, it contains a fruit extract called mongrosides, which is 200 times sweeter than the sugar we normally use in North America.  




 It depends what you mean by weight loss. If you mean adipose tissue, the adipocytes, which contain uni and multilocular cells, lose some of their size (they shrink). The main difference between the two is that the latter contain considerably more cytoplasm (the substance that makes up the cell's internal structure). When you lose weight, the triglycerides (stored fat) contained in those cells are turned into fatty acids by various hormones, such as adrenaline and noradrealine, and then bound to various proteins to form lipoproteins so they can enter the bloodstream. From there, they are used in lipolysis and result in the creation of Adenonine triphosphate (energy) through the electron transport chain of the body's tricarbolyxic acid cycle (one of the main metabolic pathways). 

However, not only fat is lost when weight is lost. Some muscle tissue is also lost. All dietary proteins are broken down into amino acids, which are sent to the body's nitrogen pool. From there, amino acids are used for various purposes, including the creation of new muscle tissue. But if the nitrogen pool has insufficient supplies of certain amino acids, muscle tissue will be broken down so its amino acids can be sent back there and used for more vital functions. Sadly, my knowledge of biochemical principles is not advanced enough to tell you to what extent, but it definitely happens.

 The research on meal timing is inconclusive. The general consensus is that your daily caloric intake is mostly what matters. You can manipulate meal timing in order to make it easier to be on a caloric deficit, but caloric intake at the end of the day is still what matters. It's just about making it work for you to do respect said caloric intake.  




 Exercise less.

Eat more dietary fibers and proteins (they fill you up).

Drink more water.

Chew gum. 

 




 Some people are going to dislike you and what you say regardless of what it is that you say. I realized that, so now I just give my opinion regardless of what others think. Can't please everyone anyway. Maybe I'm a prick, or maybe I just have an opinion that's different from yours and that you therefore perceive negatively.  




 I'm not sure exactly, but at some point before this season.  









 My daughter would never have cake at her wedding in the first place. I would never raise my children to eat that kind of food.  




 I don't eat the unhealthy foods? For things like fruits, vegetables, rice, meat, etc, I can eat them anyway because I know how many calories certain portions represent approximately. I just plan ahead when I prepare my meals for the day/week.  




 Check this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpeYiGowqWk), it sums it up pretty well I think.  




 I've played with mods before, but don't really enjoy them for the most part. Some of them are really complicated and just add more of what the game already has. One of the mods that I do enjoy though is Ruins, because it uses vanilla content only and allows you to create your own randomly generating structures. But in general, I find that there is already endless stuff to do with vanilla, so mods aren't needed.  




 I started the process of removing unhealthy foods from my diet entirely about 5 years ago. Just like everyone, I had been raised by my parents and society eating shitty foods. 5 years later, I can now go for 3-4 months without eating anything that isn't 'clean'. It's definitely a long process, and I'm not quite sure how it works in the brain, but it's tough. And people already struggle with training because it's hard and takes time to see the results, so imagine that. With that in mind, it's easy to see why most people fail to ever remove unhealthy foods from their regular diet.   




 I would rather be lonely than be forced to eat unhealthy foods just because I socialize with people who do. It's fine that not everyone understands and lives by scientific principles that relate to foods, but there's no reason to not live by what you know to be true. Just because all my friends drink alcohol and eat out at Mcdies every Friday night, doesn't mean I do as well. Be the one that all the sheep will eventually follow, not one of the sheep yourself.  




 I'm going to get downvoted like hell for this, but I just wanna say what I really think. I just think that cheat meals are an excuse for people who lack dedication and/or have been raised being used to eat unhealthy food, which they now associate with a feeling of well-being as a result. I've read a lot of research, never came across anything that justifies having 'cheat meals' from a scientific perspective. The only argument is that it helps people maintain their diet during the week by allowing them to 'take a break from it', but that argument is inherently flawed, because no one was born with the need to eat chips, pizza or cake. That need in itself is a cultural construct that society created in individuals by manipulating the various macro nutrients in food products for economic purposes.  




 I have a supercharged creeper farm. I got a supercharged creeper to blow up a regular creeper and collected its head.  




 I'm working on it! There will be a world download in a couple days for sure.  




 The first picture had me like 'WHOA!' 




 I have a Nether Fortress farm in my world. It took about 3 months to build (I had to remove everything 120 blocks around in every direction), and uses [redstonespire's Ghast Wither Ripper design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6JOe-vy3-U) from the Zipkrowd server. When it comes to redstone and general game mechanics in Minecraft, these guys are pretty much the best of the best. Almost all the most efficient farm designs out there come from them. I've also used their witch hut farm design, their supercharged creeper farm design, their self-fixable iron golem farm design and their fully automatic Wither wood farm design. That's why I have more resources than I'll ever need in my world now. The only thing I need to actually grind to get are quartz and clay. All the other resources I get from various farms and mob grinders. It's basically creative except I have to get the resources in the chests and I can't fly around to build. :p  




 Amazing! Thank you! Glad I could inspire you! 




 I used this design https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YK_BcHG2NlM 




 You should post it on /r/minecraftseeds as well.  




 Will check this out and give feedback!

Edit: wow, AMAZING seed! Good find OP! I can confirm, this is really cool, but not for the faint of heart or beginning players. The starting island has nothing but grass, dirt, sand, a single sugar cane and 4 pigs. The only island with some trees on it is a 100 block swim away, and there is an Ocean Monument right in the way. There is another Ocean Monument nearby as well, and it's in the way of another small island with trees on it too. You can see both upon first entering the map if your render distance is at at least 20 chunks. 

edit2 : WHOA, this seed has a lot more to it than expected. Right underneath the starting island, there is a tiny bit of coal and iron. And if you go further down, there is a huge ravine with lots of resources (crap ton of iron   coal, and even some gold, redstone and diamonds), and the most amazing thing is how the Ocean Monument is actually in the way of that ravine as you can see [here](http://i.imgur.com/3RaLS0K.png). This is super cool, I'd never seen anything like this before. Epic! Thanks again for sharing OP.

edit3: also, the mainland nearby has a desert, a birch forest, a swamp, a roofed forest and a savanna all bordering each other, meaning you can get almost all types of wood right off the bat!! 




 I'm a redstone noob and I feel like redstone clocks are already easy and compact enough to make. Also, there are multiple clock designs, allowing for more flexibility when building redstone devices.  









 I will try this. Thank you!  




 Let me put you in context. Me and my friend have known each other since we were 7 year old, we hang out together pretty much all the time. We're also big into fitness, in that we train regularly and eat healthy and count our calories and all that stuff. About a year ago, my friend started using cocaine in rave parties. She doesn't even smoke cigarettes, rarely smokes pot, had never really been a drug user until her cocaine use suddenly started. At first I didn't really care or pay attention to it, because I'm a big believer that most substances, when used in moderation, aren't nearly as harmful as society believes them to be. However, at first it was once in a while, once every 2-3 months or so, and now it's almost every week end. I bring it up once in a while, and her discourse is always something along of the lines 'I spend 10 hours in the gym weekly, I diet hard, I'm still healthy than 99% of people, so it doesn't really matter'. I'm starting to see a typical pattern of addiction (denial, increasingly frequent use), and it worries me. I never really say anything, but it scares me for two reasons. Firstly, any hard drug use used 2-3 times a year probably isn't realistically a big deal, but when it's every weekend, it definitely starts getting on the unhealthy side. Secondly, I'm fearful that her use will keep becoming increasingly more frequent. 

I'm not sure what to do about it. I don't know how to bring it up in a serious manner, never had a friend with what seems to be a drug issue, never really used any hard drugs of the kind myself, so I don't know what it feels like to be on this stuff regularly either. One part of me still thinks that it's not really that big of a deal, but another part of me is scared that I'm just watching her walk down a part of destruction, and I feel guilty for not reacting. What would you guys do?

TL;DR: best friend of mine is taking cocaine increasingly frequently and I'm not sure what to do. Her discourse whenever I bring it up is 'I train 10 hours a week, I diet hard, I'm still healthy than most people so it doesn't matter. 




 For me: 

-Tinkers' Construct: a more elaborated, meaningful and rewarding crafting system

-Ruins: the ability to create your own randomly generating structures

-Optifine: more in-game optimization for powerful and low cost computers alike

 




 I never had a hypothesis to begin with, that's what you don't get. I linked an interesting study that I came across and based on which I raised questions and that I was hoping to have a discussion about. I said that while you were right, there had been a misunderstanding because I never disagreed with you in the first place. I know caloric intake is what mostly matters. I was asking myself, based on the results of that study, if carb cycling combined with calorie cycling could be more effective than calorie cycling alone. That's all.   




 No thanks, I will simply go to another place that isn't full of people who seem to be incapable of having a civilized discussion on anything without being rude and throwing tamper tantrums. I clarified my point and acknowledged yours, and all you have to say is 'when are you finished crying'. I feel like I'm having a heated debate with a stuck up 16 year old. Feel free to downvote this one as well.  




 We agree that losing fat while gaining muscle is possible for overweight, untrained individuals, but much less so for advanced weight lifters who have low body fat. That's also what the FAQ states. I don't even know why we're arguing on that. I presented a study in which overweight women lost more weight through intermittent carb cycling than with a traditional caloric deficit diet. That's where my argument that, perhaps, manipulating macro division along with caloric intake could be more effective than manipulating caloric intake alone, came frome. I don't know if this is actually true. I presented a single study, and stated that it presents some evidence that supports the superiority of carb cycling. That's it. I don't know why you're so upset. I'm not making any out-of-thin-air claims. Of course caloric intake is still what mostly matters.  




 The FAQ states that it's possible for overweight   untrained individuals to gain muscle while losing fat. I never said otherwise. I'm pretty sure Lyle Macdonald has a similar discourse. Also, the technical deficit limit, as stated in the FAQ, is also based on experiments done on untrained individuals.  




 I'm pretty sure there's nothing in the FAQ stating that lifting weights and having a high protein intake while on an important calorie deficit will prevent breakdown of muscle tissue at 100%. Do you believe so? 




 I don't have any numbers, but I'm fairly sure that some muscle loss is unavoidable. Of course it's minimized given that you lift weights and that you have proper protein intake. It's not rocket science. But that wasn't my point.  




 It's not as simple as that. The research which said that a pound of fat has 3500 calories and that, therefore, eating 3500 calories less = 1 pound of fat lost is almost 50 years old now. More recent research shows that when you lose weight, you lose mostly fat but also some muscle tissue.  




 Read the FAQ/Wiki. It has literally all the info you need to get started. Also, you want to work out your entire body, not just the upper part of it.  




 Snatch grip deadlift while forcing your core out.  




 Alright. So I will simply add more powered rails. Thank you!  




 Oh man, you make me want to build a fighting arena in my world too, even though it's single player. :( 




 Yeah you're right. The title is kind of misleading. I'm sorry.  




 Last answer, because I accidentally read your comment... Let's just be clear on one thing. You might be right that 1000 calorie isn't the ideal deficit and that I don't have a source to back up what is the ideal deficit, but you are the asshole. I checked your comment history, you're the one who makes needlessly rude comments, who tells random people to commit suicide, so if anyone is an asshole and 'all sorts of fucked up in the head', it's you, not me. There's probably something going on in your life that makes you act like this, but I honestly don't care, I just wanted to point it out before I move on with my life. If there's one thing you schooled me on, it's that the internet is full of assholes. You sure did remind me of that.  




 I'm happy to be schooled, but not by people who tell random strangers on the internet to commit suicide. For me, the discussion ended when I read that. Now I'm just going to block you and put you on ignore. Have a nice life. And by the way, I will never read whatever you answer to that, so don't bother typing something.  




 You're mistaken. I wasn't referring to the 1000 calorie thing here, I just picked the first 3 papers from Layne Norton's article. And I've actually accessed all of them through library genesis, I was just too lazy to find all the download links again. But seriously, I would be lying if I said that there's an arbitrary number like 1000... there isn't... but the general consensus is that if you're between 500 and 1000,  and you eat enough protein and weight train, you won't lose that much muscle mass. I still need to do more reading to find out the relationship between this and body fat %age. But by the way, in the first study they found that resistance training mediated the muscle loss associated with a very low calorie diet in untrained women, that's pretty related to the whole 'huge calorie deficit' topic. And also I don't know if I think that I'm better to anyone, but I know that I haven't been rude and throwing out insults, unlike you, so that certainly makes me better than you in that sense.   




 Oh I see I made you angry here, that's fine... But you're wrong, in that I actually take into consideration everyone's point of view, and I try to understand how people view things, but in the end I very often end up sticking to my own. I don't see what's wrong with that. We all have our own outlook on life and that's fine and it doesn't keep us from being respectful with each other. My point of view is trying to balance between the research that I read and that I believe to be credible, and my own personal experience. But I think it's the research part that a lot of society isn't ready to accept and that's why people often get angry at what I say.  




 I don't understand why you keep being rude with me. I haven't said anything to offend you, I think. I could easily go ahead and say things like how I think that you don't know a damn thing about nutrition like a whole lot of people here, but I don't write that kind of thing because it's counterproductive and doesn't bring anything positive to the table.

Also, I didn't just look at what Layne Norton said, I looked at the research he used to make his claims, like [this](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10204826) research paper and [this one](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10332666) and [this one](http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/25/3/431.full).

I might be 'fucked up' like you say, but at least my 'fuckedupness' is based on serious research that I've read on.  




 And also, I'm not sure why you're bringing milk into the discussion, but you should read everything I wrote on the subject. I think my stance on why it's something that should not be consumed by most people is a pretty well justified one. Feel free to go ahead and prove me wrong.  



















 Things I've done so far:

-Playing mindlessly easy video games

-Watching funny TV shows

-Browsing reddit

-Watching motivational bodybuilding videos over and over again

-Chewing gum

Any other ideas?

 I've been curious about this. I'm currently planning my next comp prep, and I was wondering what you guys' protocol usually looks like. In my research, I found that that long-run (6 weeks, in this case) carbohydrate depletion increases the effectiveness of many lipid metabolism, especially the beta oxidation Acyl CoA dehydrogenases. In turn, the enzyme  Flavin adenine dinucleotid (FAD) is known to 'boost' the ability of glutamate to be transaminated (a transamination is a chemical transfer between an amino acid and an alpha-keto acid) by alanine transaminase. To me, this at least suggests that ingestion of carbohydrates following a period of severe depletion boosts lipid metabolism through the actions of Acyl CoA dehydrogenase, as well as the ability of non-essential amino acids to be used in glycolysis prior to the start of the tricarbolyxic acid cycle. 

In light of this evidence, during my last carb depletion period, I had 4 weeks during which I ingested no more than 50g of carbohydrates daily, followed by 2 weeks of severe carbohydrate depletion (no more than traces daily), followed by 10 days during which carbohydrates represented over 50% of my daily intake with 35% of proteins and 15% of dietary fats. At this point I was 2 weeks out. When I started consuming carbohydrates again, I had noticeable increases in strength and musculature, although this is obviously only anecdotal evidence. 

However, I'm looking for more science/personal experience reports on how you guys do it. :)

 




 If there is no sugar in the blood, then neither glycolysis nor ketosis can take place right?

I know that certain amino acids from the nitrogen pool contribute to the production of energy, but only indirectly as far as I know.

I know that glutamate is transaminated to pyruvate from the transaminate enzyme ALT. However, this cannot happen if there is no pyruvate to begin with, right?

I also know that glutamate is ultimately catalized (or rather, citrulline and aspartate are catallized) into fumarate, which produces some ATP, but it's impossible without ATP itself since ATP is used to catalize phosphate and ammonia to form carbamoyl phosphate.

So, this means that, theorically, if there is no glucose at all in the blood, no ATP is produced and the person simply dies, correct? Or is there some other mechanism that prevents this and that I'm unaware of? 

 









 I'm not sure if the title is a great way of calling that experience, but I went through that and I'm wondering if others did too.

I remember when I was a teen, before I started dieting, back when I didn't even know what the macro nutrients and micro nutrients were, I would just eat things based on whether I enjoyed their taste or not.

When I started dieting, it was hard because there were a lot of things that I recognized as best to eat for optimal health but of which I couldn't stand the taste. But over the years it slowly changed and recently I've noticed it... Things that used to taste really good to me, like pizza and chocolate, don't taste nearly as good as they used to, and things that used to not taste good at all (such as rice and some vegetables) now taste 'normal' if that makes sense. It's almost like foods in general don't really taste anything to my mouth anymore, and the only things that still taste a lot are the things that my brain associates as healthy and part of my pre-made diet. 

I don't know if any of what I typed makes sense, it's weird to explain, but I'm wondering if others have experienced this too and if there's a name for that phenomenon.  














 I have been lurking around the internet, but all I've been finding is anecdotal evidence. One guy writing that you should X dose, another saying that you use Y dose. I've read people claiming they use doses anywhere between 50 to 5-600mg daily. I've even seen one person say that metabolism is increased by 10% per 100mg. I understand how DNP affects the mitochondria of the cells, but even then this seems a little absurd to me. Furthermore, all these claims that people make are never backed up by any research. 

I was wondering if anyone has come across any serious research that determined what is the proper dosage in humans for weight loss purposes? I've been using Clenbuterol in the past, but my next comp prep cut is starting soon and I'm fed up with the side effects of Clen and am looking for an alternative product to use.

Thanks in advance! 




 **1. Introduction**

This is a guide I wrote on cutting on /r/fitness a while ago, but I figured I would re-post it since it is especially relevant here. 

In this post I want to show what is, in my humble opinion, the best dieting plan for cutting (losing fat), all backed up by scientific principles; I try to rely on anecdotal evidence (a.k.a bro science) as little as possible. The goals of this plan are:

A) To cut down on body fat

B) To maintain muscular strength and mass

C) To remain generally healthy


**2. Nutrient Breakdown**

I am not a believer that a calorie is just a calorie. Surely, as long as you respect your caloric intake based on the Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) formula, you will lose weight regardless of where your calories come from. However, this argument forgets two really important points. Firstly, the second most important factor after caloric intake, that is, **satiety**; if what you eat leaves you hungry, you are more likely to eat more and not respect your target caloric intake. Therefore, when I diet for cutting, I eat foods that makes me feel full. Secondly, losing weight and eating healthy do not necessarily go hand in hand; technically, you could lose weight by eating nothing but Twinkies, but does that mean you would be healthier? No. 

Based on these two points, my macro and micro nutrient breakdown when I'm cutting usually goes as follows: A) high dietary fiber, B) moderate protein, C) moderate complex carbohydrate, D) low simple carbohydrate, E) moderate good fat (unsaturated, polyunsaturated   omega-3) and as free of bad fat (saturated and trans) as possible, and F) high in vitamins (A, B, C) and minerals (calcium, zinc, phosphorus, etc.). Now I will explain the why behind each of these macro and micro nutrients:

A) High dietary fiber: when I said that I want to eat foods that make me full, I was referring to dietary fibers specifically. In fact, research has shown that fibers prolong and enhance the sensation of satiety (1) (18). 

B) Moderate protein: this one seems obvious, but I will explain it anyway. The process that creates new proteins in the body is one called protein biosynthesis. Thanks to this process, the amino acids contained in the proteins we eat are joined together chemically to form complete proteins, which are then used for many important processes, including muscle tissue maintenance and growth (2). However, what is less known is that too much protein can be harmful. In fact, ingesting too much protein causes the body to produce a compound known as ammonia, which can damange organ tissues (3). Therefore, proteins are important, but like for everything, moderation is key. 

C) Moderate complex carbohydrate: remember our second goal, maintaining muscular strength and mass. Carbohydrates provide with intensity during training in the form of muscle glycogen (4) and help prevent the breakdown of muscle tissue (2). Furthermore, complex carbohydrates are favored over simple ones (the latter which I explain later), due to the fact that they provide energy more consistently and in the long run (5); inversely, think of simple carbohydrates as peaks and valleys of energy that are absorbed really quickly into the bloodstream (9). However, once again, moderation is key, and too much carbohydrates can be harmful; in fact, carbohydrates increase insulin production, which in turn increase the percentage of your fat intake that is turned into body fat (6). 

D) Low simple carbohydrate: like I mentioned above, you want to limit your simple carbohydrate (sugar) intake while you are cutting, and perhaps even in general as well. Some research has shown that fructose, a simple carbohydrate found abundantly in fruits, soft drinks and most processed food products triggers the brains reward pathway (7) but not its satiety mechanisms (8), leading to something known as the sugar craving cycle (5) and which causes people, upon fructose consumption, to still feel hungry and want to ingest more. Nonetheless, there are two key moments during which you still want to consume simple carbohydrates: during the first meal of the day and post-exercise. This is because, during those times, insulin sensitivity is higher, which means that a bigger percentage of the carbohydrates you eat will be used as energy by the body. Insulin sensitivity is at its highest after a prolonged period of fasting (10) and post-workout, the latter usually being referred to as post-exercise insulin sensitivity in the literature (11). Therefore, you want to eat some simple carbohydrates for breakfast and as part of your post-workout. Also, your main source of simple carbohydrates should be fruits, as the latter are generally rich in dietary fibers, and the satiety effects of fibers may partly negate the effects of sugar by slowing down the absorption of the latter into the bloodstream (12). 

E) Moderate good fat and low (or no) bad fat intake: this is a complex topic, but I will try to keep it simple. Basically, dietary fats, even though they are highly caloric (nine calories per gram compared to four for proteins and carbohydrates), are essential for the body. To relate them to our second goal, dietary fats increase testosterone (9), a hormone that promotes growth of muscle tissue in ways that are beyond the scope of this post. The good fats increase the production of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, which picks up excess cholesterol in the blood and bring it back to the liver where it can be broken down (13). Certain of the good fats, like omega-3, also have a plethora of health benefits that once again go beyond the scope of what is discussed here; they prevent certain aging-related diseases and regulate metabolism, among other things (14). Inversely, the bad fats increase low-density lipoprotein cholesterol production, which does basically the opposite of HDL cholesterol and, over time, can lead to coronary artery disease (13). Long story short, a moderate fat intake is important and represents between 20 and 30% of daily caloric intake (9).

F) High vitamin and mineral intake: this is more of a common sense argument, but since you are cutting and therefore eating less, each calorie that you eat is more important in terms of the vitamins and minerals it contains. This is sadly another topic that goes beyond the scope of this post, but vitamins and minerals are important for general health, and are involved in various processes that relate to muscular tissue maintenance and growth (15) (16). Therefore, a healthy cutting diet is one that should be centered on foods that are rich in vitamins and minerals. 

**Sample dieting plan**

In light of everything that I have discussed above, this is what a sample dieting plan for a 6 ft, 200 pound, 25% body fat male in his mid-twenties and who exercises 3 to 4 times a week should look like. 

Firstly, The TDEE formula places that mans maintenance caloric intake at around 2500, and if he wants to lose 1 lb. of fat per week, he needs to be a daily caloric deficit of 500 (as a pound of adipose tissue contains 3500 calories), which places him at 2000 calories daily. You could go up to a 1000 calorie deficit without losing muscle tissue (9), but I personally find that a 500 calorie deficit is a good start for people who are not used to dieting and have more limited knowledge of nutrition. 

Secondly, I assume that this man would be eating 4 meals day, although this is mostly a matter of preference, and there is no general consensus among scientists as to what kind of meal of meal frequency is optimal for general health and weight loss (17). 

Finally, his macro nutrient breakdown would be 40% protein, 40% carbohydrate and 20% fat. This means 200g of protein, 200g of carbohydrate and 45g of fat. Furthermore, about one third to half of the carbohydrates for meal 1 and meal 3 (post workout) are simple ones, and fibers are consumed in various amounts every meal. 

Meal 1

37g old fashioned oatmeal, dry (139cal, 5prot, 25scarb, 3fat)

202g raspberries, raw (105cal, 3prot, 24carb, 1fat)

1 whole egg, hard-boiled (78cal, 6prot, 0carb, 5fat)

10 large egg whites, hard-boiled (170cal, 36prot, 0carb, 1fat)

Meal 2

141g sweet potatoes, boiled without skin (107cal, 2prot, 25carb, 0.5fat)

175g peas, unsalted, boiled (137cal, 9prot, 25carb, 0.5fat)

125g chicken breast, cooked, without skin (200 cal, 39prot, 0carb, 5fat)

10g unsalted nuts (59cal, 2prot, 2carb, 5fat)

Meal 3 (post-workout) (same as meal 1)

37g old fashioned oatmeal, dry (139cal, 5prot, 25scarb, 3fat)

202g raspberries, raw (105cal, 3prot, 24carb, 1fat)

1 whole egg, hard-boiled (78cal, 6prot, 0carb, 5fat)

10 large egg whites, hard-boiled (170cal, 36prot, 0carb, 1fat)

Meal 4

98g yam, boiled, unsalted (100cal, 1prot, 25carb, 0fat)

50g Atlantic salmon, cooked (103cal, 11prot, 0carb, 6fat)

35g avocados, raw (56cal, 1prot, 3carb, 5fat)

125g sweet potatoes, boiled, without skin (95cal, 2prot, 22carb, 0fat)

9 large egg whites, hard boiled (153cal, 32prot, 2carb, 1fat)


**Refeed days**


Firstly, refeed days are not cheat meals. They are **high carbohydrate, moderate protein, low fat days**, and all of the dieting principles mentioned earlier in this post still apply to them. 

According to bodybuilder and Nutritional Sciences PhD Layne Norton (9), refeed days should happen every 6 to 12 days, and increasingly more often the longer you have been cutting.

Through complex interactions with the brain and other parts of the human body, the hormone leptin affects appetite and metabolism. It does so notably by 'countering' the effects of certain neurotransmitters in the brain known as endocannabinoids. Decreased leptin production is associated with increased appetite and decreased metabolism; when someone has been cutting for a long time, their leptin production is decreased, which is why it becomes increasingly harder to keep losing fat despite being at a daily caloric deficit.

Here's what the research says on leptin and refeed days:

A) You should increase your caloric intake up to maintenance level (or maybe a little more if you're the 'hard gainer' body type); if you're losing 1lb a week, this is a 500 calorie increase, and more than that is probably not necessarily and might even have negative effects (19);

B) Carbohydrate consumption is associated with an increase in leptin production, but not dietary fat (20) (21);

C) As research has shown (22), an increase in carbohydrate consumption is associated with an increase in insulin levels, which in turn increases the rate at which fat is transported into the body's adipose tissue. This is because the higher the insulin levels, and the more active the enzymes responsible for breaking down fats into fatty acids are (23). Therefore, on refeed days, fat consumption should be kept to minimal amounts;

D) Simple carbohydrates, such as glucose and fructose, have no impact on leptin levels (5).

**Other things to avoid for optimal dieting**

Alcohol: on top of being highly caloric (seven calories per gram) and containing no nutrients, here's why you should avoid drinking for optimal dieting:

A) It disrupts the body's ability to repair and maintain muscle tissue, by slowing down the production of human growth hormone during deep sleep (26).

B) It slows down metabolism, by disrupting the citric acid cycle, one of the body's main metabolic pathways (27). This is complex, but simply put, alcohol is seen as a poison, and the body prioritizes its oxidation over that of fats, proteins and carbohydrates, which means that less of the macro nutrients you ingest are turned into energy, and inversely, more are turned into stored fat (28). 

C) It disrupts the enzymes that synthesize testosterone, thereby slowing down its production (29). 

D) It depletes the body's reserves of vitamins and minerals more quickly than normal (30). Like mentioned above, many vitamins and minerals are involved not only in general health, but also in various processes that relate to muscle tissue growth and maintenance. 

Cocoa: while cocoa has many health benefits (31), it is also highly caloric, high in dietary fats, and contains oxalic acid, which inhibits the absorption of minerals and vitamins by the body (32). I personally use carob over cocoa, as it is naturally sweeter, which means that you need less added sugar to get the same sweet taste, is richer in vitamins and minerals, and is free of oxalic acid (33).

 What is, in your experience, the best electrolyte supplement? 

Last time I went on a 2 week no carb period for my comp prep, I had serious mood issues, and I've realized that it is quite possibly due to electrolyte issues, based on the research I've read and on the fact that that a lot of people who go on ketogenic diets seem to experience the same thing. However, I have some specifications.

I would prefer if my electrolyte supplement was:

-free of carbohydrates (no carb diet)

-free of stimulants (I'm already using Clen HCL for cutting, don't want to get a heart attack)

-particularly high in potassium (same reason as for why I want it free of stims, otherwise I'll just keep buying potassium tablets, but that'd be a nice plus)

Does anyone know of a good electrolyte supplement that meets these requirements?  




 I made a [visual organizer](http://i.imgur.com/94M5HSP.jpg) that explains why.

As you can see the process is fairly simple. Fats are transported through the bloodstream as lipoproteins (as they cannot do so on their own) and then used by various parts of the body for various purposes. Excess fats (triglycerides) that cannot be used for anything are then stored and then regenerated in the body's tissue cells (adipocytes).

Carbs are broken down into pyruvate (pyruvic acid) and then further broken down into the molecule acetyl co-enzyme A. Through a process known as lipogenesis, acetyl co-enzyme A is then transformed into fats (fatty acids and triglycerides).

Proteins are broken down into various amino acids, including pyruvate.

Therefore, while proteins and carbohydrates are not directly stored as fat, when consumed in excess they increase the rate at which triglycerides are turned into stored fat through lipogenesis.

This is also why ketogenic (fat-based) diets work; in absence of glycolysis, acetyl coA is formed through ketosis, meaning that ketone bodies (beta-Hydroxybutyric acid and acetoacetate) synthesized from fatty acids are used to create energy (ATP) for the body instead.  



















 He is basically saying that alcohol can give cancer. Do you agree, askscience?  














 Ok, I might be talking straight out of my ass here, because I haven't done any research on the subject. But this is a question I've been asking myself. From what I understand, the research found a significant correlation between leptin production and carb intake, but not between leptin and fat and other nutrients. This is why, for example, Layne Norton says that when you've been cutting for a long time, you should have a refeed day every 6-12 days where you eat at maintenance caloric intake instead of on a deficit and your diet is high carb low fat (due to the fact that insulin increases adipose uptake of fatty acids). You can check out what he says [here](http://www.simplyshredded.com/layne-norton-the-most-effective-cutting-diet.html).

Anyway, aren't refeed days a form of carb cycling in a way? You manipulate your carb and calorie intakes for the purpose of replenishing leptin serum production. Now this is only anecdotal evidence, but carb cycling has worked for me and for a lot of other people from what I've heard. I've been wondering if this could be because of the sudden changes in carb intake from alternating no carb days with high carb ones; maybe that affects leptin production, which partly explains why it works? Anyway, like I said, I haven't found any research on the subject, but this is something I've been wondering. 

TL;DR my question is basically: does carb cycling affect leptin production in the same way that refeed days do?  



















 **1. Introduction**

In this post I want to show what is, in my humble opinion, the best dieting plan for cutting (losing fat), all backed up by scientific principles; I try to rely on anecdotal evidence (a.k.a bro science) as little as possible. The goals of this plan are:

A) To cut down on body fat

B) To maintain muscular strength and mass

C) To remain generally healthy


**2. Nutrient Breakdown**

I am not a believer that a calorie is just a calorie. Surely, as long as you respect your caloric intake based on the Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) formula, you will lose weight regardless of where your calories come from. However, this argument forgets two really important points. Firstly, the second most important factor after caloric intake, that is, **satiety**; if what you eat leaves you hungry, you are more likely to eat more and not respect your target caloric intake. Therefore, when I diet for cutting, I eat foods that makes me feel full. Secondly, losing weight and eating healthy do not necessarily go hand in hand; technically, you could lose weight by eating nothing but Twinkies, but does that mean you would be healthier? No. 

Based on these two points, my macro and micro nutrient breakdown when I'm cutting usually goes as follows: A) high dietary fiber, B) moderate protein, C) moderate complex carbohydrate, D) low simple carbohydrate, E) moderate good fat (unsaturated, polyunsaturated   omega-3) and as free of bad fat (saturated and trans) as possible, and F) high in vitamins (A, B, C) and minerals (calcium, zinc, phosphorus, etc.). Now I will explain the why behind each of these macro and micro nutrients:

A) High dietary fiber: when I said that I want to eat foods that make me full, I was referring to dietary fibers specifically. In fact, research has shown that fibers prolong and enhance the sensation of satiety (1) (18). 

B) Moderate protein: this one seems obvious, but I will explain it anyway. The process that creates new proteins in the body is one called protein biosynthesis. Thanks to this process, the amino acids contained in the proteins we eat are joined together chemically to form complete proteins, which are then used for many important processes, including muscle tissue maintenance and growth (2). However, what is less known is that too much protein can be harmful. In fact, ingesting too much protein causes the body to produce a compound known as ammonia, which can damange organ tissues (3). Therefore, proteins are important, but like for everything, moderation is key. 

C) Moderate complex carbohydrate: remember our second goal, maintaining muscular strength and mass. Carbohydrates provide with intensity during training in the form of muscle glycogen (4) and help prevent the breakdown of muscle tissue (2). Furthermore, complex carbohydrates are favored over simple ones (the latter which I explain later), due to the fact that they provide energy more consistently and in the long run (5); inversely, think of simple carbohydrates as peaks and valleys of energy that are absorbed really quickly into the bloodstream (9). However, once again, moderation is key, and too much carbohydrates can be harmful; in fact, carbohydrates increase insulin production, which in turn increase the percentage of your fat intake that is turned into body fat (6). 

D) Low simple carbohydrate: like I mentioned above, you want to limit your simple carbohydrate (sugar) intake while you are cutting, and perhaps even in general as well. Some research has shown that fructose, a simple carbohydrate found abundantly in fruits, soft drinks and most processed food products triggers the brains reward pathway (7) but not its satiety mechanisms (8), leading to something known as the sugar craving cycle (5) and which causes people, upon fructose consumption, to still feel hungry and want to ingest more. Nonetheless, there are two key moments during which you still want to consume simple carbohydrates: during the first meal of the day and post-exercise. This is because, during those times, insulin sensitivity is higher, which means that a bigger percentage of the carbohydrates you eat will be used as energy by the body. Insulin sensitivity is at its highest after a prolonged period of fasting (10) and post-workout, the latter usually being referred to as post-exercise insulin sensitivity in the literature (11). Therefore, you want to eat some simple carbohydrates for breakfast and as part of your post-workout. Also, your main source of simple carbohydrates should be fruits, as the latter are generally rich in dietary fibers, and the satiety effects of fibers may partly negate the effects of sugar by slowing down the absorption of the latter into the bloodstream (12). 

E) Moderate good fat and low (or no) bad fat intake: this is a complex topic, but I will try to keep it simple. Basically, dietary fats, even though they are highly caloric (nine calories per gram compared to four for proteins and carbohydrates), are essential for the body. To relate them to our second goal, dietary fats increase testosterone (9), a hormone that promotes growth of muscle tissue in ways that are beyond the scope of this post. The good fats increase the production of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, which picks up excess cholesterol in the blood and bring it back to the liver where it can be broken down (13). Certain of the good fats, like omega-3, also have a plethora of health benefits that once again go beyond the scope of what is discussed here; they prevent certain aging-related diseases and regulate metabolism, among other things (14). Inversely, the bad fats increase low-density lipoprotein cholesterol production, which does basically the opposite of HDL cholesterol and, over time, can lead to coronary artery disease (13). Long story short, a moderate fat intake is important and represents between 20 and 30% of daily caloric intake (9).

F) High vitamin and mineral intake: this is more of a common sense argument, but since you are cutting and therefore eating less, each calorie that you eat is more important in terms of the vitamins and minerals it contains. This is sadly another topic that goes beyond the scope of this post, but vitamins and minerals are important for general health, and are involved in various processes that relate to muscular tissue maintenance and growth (15) (16). Therefore, a healthy cutting diet is one that should be centered on foods that are rich in vitamins and minerals. 

**Sample dieting plan**

You could go up to a 1000 calorie deficit without losing muscle tissue (9), but I personally find that a 500 calorie deficit is a good start for people who are not used to dieting and have more limited knowledge of nutrition.

ingredients except carob chips and blend/pulse together. 

3. Stir in 1/4 cup carob chip in chocolate batter. 

4. Pour brownie mixture into prepared baking pan. Spread remaining carob chips on top of black bean brownie mixture. 

5. Bake for 20-25 min. until toothpick can be inserted into middle of mixture and come out clean.

6. Let cool down for about 1 hour, then put in fridge. 

**Why I use carob over chocolate:**

-Carob is naturally sweeter, so less added sugar is needed to get the same sweet taste;

-Carob contains less fat (high carb and high fat do not mix well together, as carbs increase insulin production and insulin production increases adipose tissue uptake of fatty acids);

-Carob has more vitamins and minerals, and less oxalic acid, the latter which can inhibit absorption of certain minerals by the body. 














 Basically, I'm a bit weird compared to a lot of guys, in the sense that my 'sexual awareness' only appeared when I was 19, compared to most of my male friends who started talking about girls when they were 14-15 and some earlier than that. When I was high school, I had a lot of friends or people that I would hang out with daily, some were guys, some were girls, but to me, they were just that, friends or acquaintances and nothing more. I never thought that I was attracted to guys, and I'm not, but I was never aware of my attraction to girls until I was about 19. It came really suddenly too: I was in a bar, and a girl that I didn't know that well started dancing with me and we kissed, and after that I started thinking about, about her body touching mine, and about what all that stuff meant. Before that, I was completely oblivious to sexuality and relationships. I don't know why it was like that. But no one really told me about it, no one teased me about it or anything like that when I was in high school. I guess people just assumed I hadn't met the right person yet.

Now how is this a problem? Well the problem is a girl that I consider one of my best friends if not the best - we've known each other since we were 12 - and that I now find myself somehow really attracted to. We do everything together. We go to the gym together, run together, have dinners and watch movies together, often hang out at each other's place, etc.. She even tells me about the stuff she does with her boyfriend and we talk about a lot of intimate things. But it was never a big deal because we've known each other for a long time and really get along with and share a similar view of the world and hobbies. Well, it was never a big deal until now, that is. Recently I realized that she wasn't just a friend, that she was also a girl, and a pretty attractive one at that. And I'm having thoughts that I find inappropriate, first, because she's my friend and you're not supposed to be thinking of sleeping with your friends, and also because she has a boyfriend, who is also a good friend of mine and someone I see everyday at the gym. She says that I've been acting weird lately and that I've been keeping something from her, and it's true, but the thing is, how do you go about telling someone that you shouldn't hang out anymore because you have thoughts of having sex with them? And also, I don't wanna lose her friendship, it's precious to me, but at the same time I'm having sexual thoughts and I'm finding that they're increasingly harder to control, and I don't really know what to do.

Tl;dr I've started to have sexual thoughts about my girl friend who's also one of my best friends that I've known for 9 years.  
























 For how long did you do it? What complementary exercises did you do along with the squats? I know it works the upper body too, but since the back and pecs aren't hit as hard, did you also have compound back and chest exercises? Like maybe bench press and rows? Thanks in advance!! 




 So my understanding of chemistry in general is fairly limited, so hopefully the chemistry people can chime in and help me with this.

I know that when the TCA occurs, the process of dehydrogenation takes place, which requires the action of the co-enzyme NAD (as it's a redox reaction). I also know that as ethanol is being converted to acetate, the action of NAD is also required, as it gets converted back and forth to NAD and NADH during that process (since it's also a redox reaction).  Basically, when carbon dioxide is oxidized from citric acid, the electrons transfer to NDA+ to create NADH. 

So, technically, that means that when alcohol enters the liver, there should be an overlap, right? Based on logic, that also means alcohol leads to an increase in fat storage, because the TCA transforms fat into energy, and if it does so at a lesser rate because of alcohol (due to NAD co-enzyme overlap), then there is also an increase in adipose uptake of triglycerides as a result (since they aren't used by the body as energy).

However, I could be wrong, but if I understand correctly, it means ingestion of alcohol indirectly results in an increase in fat storage in the body? 

edit: I found the info here http://zwz.cz/f/allgood1186/1PJ5JPDV/Obrazky-metabolism-chart

edit2: by 'does it increase fat storage?' I actually mean 'does it reduce the lipolysis rate?', sorry for using a misleading expression. I wish I could edit the title now. 

edit3: not too sure why this got so big. I just asked a question and it got more or less accurately answered by at least 10 people in the comments. I wanted to know if ethanol ingestion affected the lipolysis rate. It does. There isn't any more to this lol.  









 My understanding of chemistry is not that good, but I understand that alcohol can only be broken down by enzymes in the liver known as alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH). Those enzymes are also responsible for catalyzing the chemical reactions of certain functional groups (such as hydroxil) within molecules during the body's citric acid cycle (TCA), which is one of the three main metabolic pathways. When alcohol reaches the liver, the ADH have to start breaking down alcohol, and as a result the TCA is disrupted, which causes an increase in fat storage. What I don't understand: why? I don't understand how the fact that ADHs have to break down ethanol disrupts the TCA.  














 Which one do you guys prefer?

One of my friends who's a kin student says that the latter should be avoided because most people don't have the shoulder flexibility necessary to do it properly and you can easily strain your rotator cuff muscles.

Yet I've been doing it for years and never had any injuries. I've done the military press too. I like both, but find that the behind the neck one stimulates my triceps more.  




 I know it's mostly a matter of preference, that it mostly comes down to caloric intake.

Still, some prefer one of these to the other 2. I'm among those who prefer the low to no carb, moderate protein and moderate fat diet. For me, fulfilling a small carb craving used to almost always lead to a much bigger one, which made it hard to respect my target caloric intake, so I stopped eating all carb foods except vegetables. And since then dieting has been easy. 

I only eat high carb and low fat on my refeed days, once every 2 weeks. I have a friend who functions very well on a moderate carb and moderate diet. Which one works best for you guys? I'm curious to know.  









 It's my 16th day of 0 carb. The 2 first weeks weren't so bad, but now people are asking me why I tell them to fuck off when they ask me why I'm so short tempered lol.

I've tried a lot of things. Listening to relaxing music, taking warm baths, watching funny movies, and it's helped to an extent, but there are still times when I feel like throwing my fist into a wall. 

I've tried asking my coach, and said that you just have to deal with it, that's it part of the 'carb cleansing process'. -_-

So, any tips guys? What do you usually do to help with the bad mood on low carb days? 


 









 I've seen a lot of people on this sub say that not only is it fine to have cheat meals, but that it's also a good thing. I would like to argue that this is not true at all, and let me explain why.

Firstly, the idea that it's actually a good thing to have days during which you 'binge eat' even when you're cutting comes from the research on leptin, the mother of all fat burning hormones.

Through complex interactions with the brain and other parts of the human body, leptin affects appetite and metabolism. It does so notably by 'countering' the effects of certain neurotransmitters in the brain known as endocannabinoids (1). Decreased leptin production is associated with increased appetite and decreased metabolism; when someone has been cutting for a long time, their leptin production is decreased, as leptin production is dependent on caloric intake (2), which is why it becomes increasingly harder to keep losing fat despite being at a daily caloric deficit.

In order to solve this problem, scientists working with athletes for whom weight is a concern have come up with something known as the 'refeed method', which consists in having days where caloric intake is significantly higher in order to increase leptin production. However, those 'refeed days' are not what people on this sub perceive as 'cheat days'; instead, **they are low fat, moderate protein, high carbohydrate days.**

Here's what the research says on those refeed days:

-You should increase your caloric intake up to maintenance level; if you're losing 1lb a week, this is a 500 calorie increase, and more than that is probably not necessary and might even have negative effects (3).

-Carbohydrate consumption is associated with an increase in leptin production, **but not dietary fat** (4)(5).

-As research has shown (6), an increase in carbohydrate consumption is associated with an increase in insulin levels, which in turn increases the rate at which fat is transported into the body's adipose tissue. This is because the higher the insulin levels, and the more active the enzymes responsible for breaking down fats into fatty acids are (7). Therefore, on refeed days, fat consumption should be kept to minimal amounts; 

-Simple carbohydrates, such as glucose and fructose, have no impact on leptin levels (8).

What does this all mean? Well, **no research has ever said that it's ever fine to 'binge eat' or to consume bad fats and simple carbohydrates in large amounts.** Refeed days should be days where you eat at maintenance level, and where your diet is a low to no fat, moderate protein, high carb one. According to Nutritional Sciences PhD and bodybuilder Layne Norton (9), refeed days should initially happen once every 2 weeks, and as you progress into your dieting process, should become more frequent up to once every 6 days. But they certainly aren't an excuse to eat unhealthy or to not count calories. In fact, from a nutritional point of view, nothing really justifies doing such things, ever.

I apologize if I'm shattering your food dreams, or being a party pooper, but this is the cold hard truth.  




 As far as I know, where it comes to refeed periods, there's two methods: 

1) having a relatively long (1-2 weeks) period of caloric maintenance at various points throughout the process of caloric deficit

2) having much shorter (3 days or less) periods of significant caloric surplus (500 cal.) increasingly often as the person progresses through the process of caloric deficit

Personally, I've only tried the second method, and I've had moderate results. In this [research paper](http://jn.nutrition.org/content/130/12/3127S.short), they found that meal-induced increase in leptin production takes 4-7 hours to occur, which seems to suggest that having short periods of caloric surplus is better than having longer periods of caloric maintenance. 

However, I'm looking to try the first method as well anyway, because I know that there's sometimes a difference between theory and practice, but I would like to get feedback before I do. How do you guys usually go about your re-feeding periods? 

Also, in [this study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1087161/) and [this study](http://www.pnas.org/content/98/11/6402), they found that high levels of EFA (particularly Arachidonic acid, which is found notably in fish and meat) increase production of the cannabinoid neurotransmitter Anandamide as well as lipogenesis in rats (the two are obviously related). I'm no expert on the topic, but since increased leptin production also leads to reduced production of Anandamide (source [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18516053)), does that mean that EFA intake should also be reduced during the refeed periods in order to maximize their effectiveness? I'm looking for feedback on that as well, so I can figure out what percentage of my caloric intake fat should represent.

 http://paindoesnthurt.com/fat-loss-plateau-1-leptin/

Thought I would share this with you guys. This is a great read, simply explained, and backed up by actual research. It summarizes the research on leptin hormone (a.k.a the appetite hormone) and weight loss. 

Basically, since leptin is synthesized primarily from fat cells, the lower your body fat percentage and the lower your leptin production. Leptin counters the effects of naturally occurring THC-like substances in the brain known as endocannabinoids, which reduce metabolism and increase appetite. Therefore, the lower your leptin production, the harder it becomes to keep losing body fat.

The author outlines methods such as refeed days or periods and which allows the person to manipulate leptin production in order to break through weight loss plateaus.  




 I posted this in r/relationships, but didn't really get the help I was looking for. So I'm posting here. I figured, here I'm probably more likely to find people who have had similar experiences. So here goes:

 Basically, the TL;DR version of this post is that I have a compulsive need for counting all the calories that I eat, every meal and every day. I know my anxiety is not rational, that not counting calories all the time isn't that big of a deal, but not knowing how many calories what I eat contains causes me anxiety and extreme discomfort.

It started when I was 15. Back then, I was playing football, and my coach had told the team that, in order to get more muscular and stronger, we needed to eat in surplus. I really wanted to succeed, so I started learning about nutrition, asked my mom to buy me a food scale and started calorie-counting and weighting all my food.

When I was in my last year of high school, an injury pretty much ended my chances of playing in college, so I quit. But by then, counting calories and lifting weights had become a habit, so I started doing bodybuilding instead. Around this time, I was spending a lot of time reading 'bro science' on the internet and I quickly realized that calorie-counting could be applied not just to getting more muscular and stronger, but also to all aspects of one's physique: to prepare for a running competition, to get bigger and stronger, to cut down on fat, etc.. Around that time, I became quite a bit of a nutrition junkie. I started reading on actual research on nutrition and health and all that stuff.

I always thought calorie-counting was a good habit, and it never was a problem. But I'm almost 21 now, and all my friends are teasing me about the fact that I've never really had a girlfriend, that I never really talk about girls as more than friends or acquaintances. Because of that, a couple months ago I started socializing more, I started getting out there so as to increase my chances of meeting someone that I get along with.

The problem is, socializing involves eating without being able to calorie-count all the time, and that prospect causes me extreme mental discomfort. I realized that only recently. For example, 2 weeks ago, my family was having a family meeting at a restaurant, and I didn't go because I was afraid of the anxiety eating food that I couldn't calorie-count would cause me. Also, 2 days ago, I was gonna ask out one of my classmates in college, but I backed out at the last second because I realized that any part of the date that involved eating somewhere would cause me to feel unwell.
Like I said, I know it's not rational. I know that if you calorie-count like 80% of the time, you are fine. But not being able to know how many calories are contained in what I eat causes me anxiety. Also, I find the stuff that they serve in most restaurants and fast food chains to be disgusting, and I don't tell people because I'm scared that they'll think I'm weird or something. Personally, I rarely eat anything other than chicken, brown rice, sweet potatoes, eggs, nuts and lettuce. And my parents think that it's 'not normal' but I pay for my own food for the most part, so they can't really have a say in what I eat.

I've realized that my calorie-counting habit, no matter how good it is, has started to impact my social life negatively in various ways, and I don't know what to do about it. I don't know how to stop, and that is causing me almost as much anxiety as not being able to count calories, so I'm stuck in vicious circle of anxiety that I don't really know how to escape.

Edit : I've read all the comments so far. Thanks for the amazing support. I'm not too sure what to say. I'll re-edit when I am.  




 Ladies, may I ask why?

Very serious question. Please don't judge or make fun. 

As someone who was once at as high as 25% and is now sitting at 10-12%, I am actually offended by this thought.

Are you telling me that I ever dropped below 10%, which I plan to do in the future, I would be perceived as ugly? 

 









 My cutting diet consists in 2000 calories, distributed equally across the 4 following meals (which, as you will notice, are really just four times the same meal):

200g Chicken, roasted, without skin (330 cal, 62 prot, 7 fat)

15g Unsalted mixed nuts (89 cals, 3 prot, 8 fat)

71g Brown rice, cooked, medium grain (81 cals, 1.7 prot, 17 carb, 1.7 prot)

50g of lettuce, raw (8.5 cals, 0.5 prot, 1.5 carb)

For a total of 508.5 calories, 67.1 prot, 18.5 carb and 15.6 fat per meal. The overall total is 2034 calories, 1078.4 from prot, 296 from carb, and 561.6 from fat. 

That means 1908.8 of the calories come from the 3 main macronutrients. 

Why this diet for cutting? They say that as long it fits your macros, it doesn't matter; this is certainly true. However, let me explain to you why my diet works better for me, and I'll let you judge whether it could work just as well for you or not: 

-**Counting the calories of and weighting a bunch of different food products is time-consuming and more complicated**, opening up more room for calculation mistakes that might end up making the entire dieting process less effective. On the other hand, this diet plan took me less than 15 min. to make and is extremely simple to follow daily. The whole dieting process is amazingly effortless.  

-**When it comes to cutting, the second most important thing after counting calories is increasing your dietary fiber intake**. This is because fibers are what makes you feel 'full' and satisfied after you've had food, meaning you feel less hungry with less calories. Brown rice happens to be one of the best sources of dietary fiber around, and lettuce contains quite a bit of fiber too.

-**Nuts are one of the healthiest and fiber-richest sources of healthy fats that exist.** They contain many vitamins that are important for humans. They are also very low in Cholesterol, something that cannot be said for many fat-based food products. It's true that they contain quite a bit of saturated fat, but this is not an issue as long as you count your macros and eat them in reasonable quantities. 

-**Lettuce is ridiculously low in calories**, and not only it is rich in dietary fibers, like I've mentioned above, it also contains just about every vitamin and mineral that humans need in order to remain healthy.

-**As you can see, my diet contains no simple carbohydrates, which are colloquially known as sugar. From my own experience, and I'm sure you can relate, sugar is addictive in a way.** More often than not, when you fulfill a small sugar craving, it leads to an even bigger one, and the next thing you know, you've eaten more than you were supposed to and you are now above your target caloric intake. Yes, the research on 'sugar addiction' is controversial and inconclusive, but personally, anecdotal evidence based on personal experience was more than enough to justify removing simple carbohydrate foods from my diet entirely. In the past, resisting sugar cravings was a struggle for me, and when I first started not eating sugar anymore, I went through hell. However, over time, it got easier, and many months later, I don't crave sugar anymore and I find that it has made dieting much easier. The months of mental suffering were definitely worth it!

-**High protein and low carbohydrate diets can make you increase muscular mass and strength, contrary to what some think.** In the absence of much carbohydrates, the body becomes much more efficient at using stored muscle glycogen and at performing despite far fewer carbohydrates and less insulin. **So, no, not eating much carbohydrates does't mean that you'll lose all your hard-earned gym gains.**

TL;DR The diet that has worked best for me is chicken, rice, nuts and lettuce only all day everyday.  









 Have you ever wondered why losing weight seems to become harder the longer you do it? I have certainly wondered too, and the research that I've done has helped me find both an explanation and somewhat of a solution for that problem, which is what this thread is about.

Most people don't know this, but much of the weight loss research of the past two decades has been done on the hormone known as 'leptin'. It was discovered in the nineties through experiments done on rats. Rats who didn't have the gene responsible for leptin production were three times as big as other rats, quickly developed symptoms of diabetes II and couldn't control their hunger. However, when they received the gene, their size went back to normal, the symptoms disappeared, and they stopped eating everything in their way. Since then, a lot of research has been done on the hormone.

Leptin is a hormone synthesized primarily from fat cells, which in turn come from the food you eat. Its main purpose is to control your appetite; it's what tells your body 'stop, you've had enough!' after you've eaten a certain amount of food. It does so by countering the effects of naturally occuring THC-like substances in the brain known as endocannabinoids. You know how when you ingest or smoke THC, you wanna eat your face off afterwards? Well, endocannabinoids do the same thing but to a lesser extent. When leptin production is increased, the effects of those substances are decreased, leading to increased metabolism and reduced appetite. However, when you've been on a caloric deficit for a long time, your leptin production is significantly decreased, which is why it's harder to keep losing fat. 

In light of this evidence, many athletes and fitness celebrities for whom weight is a concern have developed a method known as the 'refeed period', which consists in eating a daily caloric surplus over a short period of time in order to make it easier to eat less and burn more fat afterwards. This is usually done in the weeks prior to a competition or fitness show. How can this be used for the average layperson who wants to lose weight? Well, by having, throughout your cutting program, days or periods during which you eat in surplus, so as to refresh your leptin production. There is also evidence which suggests that these periods of re-feeding should become more frequent the longer you've been cutting. 

In my researching, I have also found that leptin is an incredibly complex and not fully understood hormone. There seems to be other factors which affect leptin production. For example, one study from 2005 found that when patients were well rested, their leptin production was 'optimal'. Furthermore, there seems to be a link between leptin and the stress hormone, cortisol: in well-rested patients, when their leptin production was high, their cortisol production was proportionately low, suggesting that there is also a more direct link between weight loss and cortisol. In fact, other studies have found a link between cortisol and abdominal fat. 

In short, here's what I am **NOT saying** but which could easily be interpreted from what I have written:

-that you should justify your THC use as something that will help you eat your face off;

-that you should justify eating your face off as an excuse to eat a caloric surplus.

What I am **actually saying** is:

-while cutting, you should have periods where you aren't cutting, but instead eating a caloric surplus, such as one day per week or a few meals throughout the week, to make sure that your leptin production stays high.

 I know the crash period that will follow the end of my cutting period will be a brutal one.

Besides the obvious stuff, like increasing fiber intake, what are you guys' tip to not eat the face of the world when you come off the appetite suppressants?

Because of that, a couple months ago I started socializing more, I started getting out there so as to increase my chances of meeting someone that I get along with.

The problem is, socializing involves eating without being able to calorie-count all the time, and that prospect causes me extreme mental discomfort. I realized that only recently. For example, 2 weeks ago, my family was having a family meeting at a restaurant, and I didn't go because I was afraid of the anxiety eating food that I couldn't calorie-count would cause me. Also, 2 days ago, I was gonna ask out one of my classmates in college, but I backed out at the last second because I realized that any part of the date that involved eating somewhere would cause me to feel unwell.

Like I said, I know it's not rational. I know that if you calorie-count like 80% of the time, you are fine. But not being able to know how many calories are contained in what I eat causes me anxiety. Also, I find the stuff that they serve in most restaurants and fast food chains to be disgusting, and I don't tell people because I'm scared that they'll think I'm weird or something. Personally, I rarely eat anything other than chicken, brown rice, sweet potatoes, eggs, nuts and lettuce. And my parents think that it's 'not normal' but I pay for my own food for the most part, so they can't really have a say in what I eat.

I've realized that my calorie-counting habit, no matter how good it is, has started to impact my social life negatively in various ways, and I don't know what to do about it. I don't know how to stop, and that is causing me almost as much anxiety as not being able to count calories, so I'm stuck in vicious circle of anxiety that I don't really know how to escape. 









 **First, here's some facts about nutrition:**

1. When it comes to weight loss, by far the most important factor is how many calories you eat. The when, what and how don't matter much, based on what science has shown so far. There was a guy in the U.S who lost 27 pounds on a diet of Twinkies, Oreos and Doritos. How? By counting his calories. 

2. The thing that makes eating on a caloric deficit the easiest is how 'full' what you eat makes you feel. When cutting (losing fat), you wanna eat foods that will make you feel more full, so as to be able to go through your day while eating less. Inversely, if you're bulking (gaining muscular mass), you wanna eat things that don't make you feel too full, so you can eat more. Things that make you feel full are white meat, complex carb foods (such as pasta) and, most importantly, fiber-rich foods (such as oatmeal). Find a more exhaustive list [here](http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/high-fiber-food).

What does that mean? Simply put, to lose weight you need to: a) count your calories and b) eat foods that make you feel full. That's it. If you do those two things, no matter what you eat, you won't necessarily be healthy, but you WILL reach your weight goals.

So how to actually count calories? Here's how:

1. **Calculate your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) [here](http://iifym.com/tdee-calculator/).** This will calculate how many calories you need to eat in a day in order to maintain your current weight, based on your age, sex, height, weight, and time spent doing physical activity weekly. To be even more accurate, use the formula that takes into account your body fat percentage. You can estimate that based on pictures found [here](http://www.builtlean.com/2012/09/24/body-fat-percentage-men-women/). 

2. **Take the number of calories you got from the TDEE calculator, and either add or substract depending on your goal.** Generally, you wanna stay within 300 of your TDEE, unless you have advanced knowledge of nutrition. If you wanna gain mass, add 300; if you wanna lose fat, subtract the same amount. 

3. **Use a food nutrient database such as [this one](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/nutrient.htm) to make your diet.** This is a hot topic, but generally, you want your diet to be made up of 40% proteins, 40%  carbohydrates, and 20% fats (mostly essential fatty acids). Also, keep in mind, one gram of protein and carbohydrate each contain 4 calories, and one gram of fat contains 9. So if you have a 2000 calorie diet, you would be eating 200 grams of protein, 200 grams of carbohydrate and 45 grams of fat daily. Now, remember, when you eat doesn't matter nearly as much as how much you eat, so the question of how many meals you should split those quantities into doesn't matter too much. However, as a rule of thumb, between 3 and 5 meals will keep you happy and going through your day if you have lots of filling foods in your diet.

4. **Buy a food scale on Amazon.com.** A decent food scale costs less than $20 if you take into account the shipping fees, as you can see [here](http://www.amazon.com/Scales-Measuring-Tools-Cooks-Gadgets/b?ie=UTF8 node=289787). For something so useful in the long-run, $20 certainly isn't much. Now, when it comes to how you weight your food, it doesn't matter too much as long as you're consistent. I personally weight everything in grams, because that's how I get the most accurate results, but if, for example, you're weighting something post-cooking, then do that for everything else as well. If you are not consistent in your weighting practices, you will get results that are overall less accurate, and it will make your life more complicated too.

5. **Be practical in ways that make your life more simple.** When you start, try to limit yourself to simple healthy foods that are easy to prepare, weight and put together. Examples: chicken, brown rice, sweet potatoes, oatmeal, nuts, fiber-rich fruits like blueberries and raspberries, etc.. Over time, you can diversify your diet, once you've gotten more used to weighting and preparing food. Also, do things that will make it easy to prepare and weight food in the long run, like having re-usable Ziploc bags with the food name and quantity in grams written on it. For example, I eat nuts 4 times a day, once per meal, and I have 4 Ziploc plastic bags, on each of which is written 'nuts, 30g'. This way, I remember that I have to prepare 4 bags of 30g of nuts daily, just by looking at my Ziploc bags. 

Here you go. A simple guide to make calorie counting easier. Of course you're still gonna have to spend a bit of time preparing your food every day, but there's no way around that. But remember, calorie counting is by far the most important thing. You could eat literally anything, and as long you calorie-count, you will still get results. So the time spent calorie-counting is definitly worth it! Hope this helps and if you have any questions, ask away and I will do my best to answer.  




 I know it stores and transports energy across cells. I know that it's used for every muscle contraction. I know that it's bound to 3 phosphates, and that when the 3rd bound is broken down, it forms another organic compound known as adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and a free phosphate molecule in order to provide a cell with energy. Sometimes, this process leads to the formation of excess cell energy, which is stored by forming ATP from ADP and phosphate. That's about it. I'm having a hard time making sense of all of this. Can anybody explain this like I'm 5 year old? 

Thanks in advance. 



















 Let's say you do a strength program such as 5x5 P/P/L with a moderate caloric deficit (300 ish). I would think that resistance training + weight loss drugs that increase heartbeat leads to more fat loss than resistance training with cardio. I don't know for sure though. What do you guys think?  




 Just curious to see if anyone had an experience similar to the one I had.

I did this back in December, and the first time I did, I literally vomited all over the floor at the end. During the first week, I did this only, and from the second week onwards, I started addding some complementary exercises.

I like how it worked my upper body too, from keeping the bar on my back for so long and from working to keep my lungs filled with air through heavy breathing. It's actually a full body workout, even though the main thing that gets destroyed is your legs. But because of that, I added some complementary upper body exercises.

Anything I could add or improve on? 








 





























 I've been searching the web for 100, 105, 120 and 130lb dumbbells, but all I've found was either low weight dumbbells or custom 'add-weight' dumbell thingies where you can make your own dumbbell weight by adding plates to a dumbell kit. I'm looking for actual dumbbells.  
























 I would have posted on /r/steroids, but I'm not allowed to post there yet. 

I've been training for almost 6 years and I've come to a point where, as a natural bodybuilder, my diet and training really have to be on point if I want to keep making significant gains. I'm also feeling pretty down lately and going through a shitty time. Because of this, I'm really tempted to start using AAS, for some reason thinking that seeing better gains would make me feel better.

I've been educating myself for about 2 years on the subject. I know where to buy everything, how to plan, how to inject, the side effects, etc.  Basically, at this point, I've looked at the community websites, I've looked at the research, I've read it all, and it's just a matter of decision. There's also another problem... I'm only 20 year old. I've heard a lot of people say that you should at least wait until you have a couple years of dieting and training under your belt before you start using steroids, but in my case that clearly doesn't apply.

So, even though I could easily use steroids but know I shouldn't, I'm really tempted to do so. Please, help me. I need help to convince myself to stay off the gear. I know this may sound like a dumb question, but I'm literally thinking about this all the time, I even have dreams of it at night, and the urge to just buy them and get on with it is getting harder to resist every day. 



 







































 I mean, sometimes I run outside or even on a treadmill, but it's because I enjoy doing it and because I understand the importance of keeping a healthy heart... I don't do it to lose weight.

When I'm bulking, I lift weights and eat a lot.

When I'm cutting, I lift weights faster and eat a lot less. I stop eating fast digesting carbs, and eat moderate amounts of slow digesting ones. 

I find that there's no point to spend hours on a treadmill or elleptical machine to lose fat, since it's mostly your diet anyway. It's boring as hell. Also, I burn a lot of calories just by doing an intense workout like some kind of circuit training one.

Am I the only one?   














 Basically, title. I know a girl who is into fitness and bodybuilding, she does cardio and lift weights 4 days a week. But, she doesn't wanna do delt exercises because she thinks that, in the long run, it would make her too 'wide'. That's obviously plain wrong to me, but I don't know her that well and I'm not sure how to approach the discussion and bring up my point of view on the subject without coming off as a condescending person. 














 Just wanted to share this with you guys, because it's a [pretty cool study with pretty interesting findings.](http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0089431#pone-0089431-g004)

In this study, they found no correlation between post-workout Myofibrillar Protein Synthesis (MPS) and Resistance Training (RT)-induced hypertrophy.

A group of untrained men did a workout during which they also had a protein rich beverage. They found an increase in MPS both throughout and after the workout. They found no correlation, however, between MPS and RT-induced hypertrophy 6 hours after the workout. They also found no correlation between MPS and RT-induced hypertrophy after 16 weeks of RT. The authors suggest that there is no 'linear relationship between hypertrophy and changes in protein abundance'. In other words, MPS does not lead to more RT-induced hypertrophy in first time weight lifters.
