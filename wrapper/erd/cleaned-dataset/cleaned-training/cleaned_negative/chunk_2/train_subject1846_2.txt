 I often get these kinds of thoughts. I suddenly become aware of how easy it would be for me to just whip out my dick and rub it on random people. 




 Nice try. 




 Yeah I know, the problem is I need to shoot from farther because the camera lens doesn't have the greatest macro capability. 




 HAHAHAH This is incredible, you are incredible. 




 The only good thing that came out of this tragedy is that it really helped us unite with our brothers down south.

 About halfway up the thigh, I guess.

 My mantras are "I will work harder", and "Napoleon is always right." 




 Any Malaysian Airlines plane. 




 Being half awake in the morning and hearing the people around you getting ready to go to work while you get to sleep in. 




 Use it on Emma Watson, duh. I don't care how immoral or insincere it is. It's Emma freakin' Watson. 




 Hire a bunch of clowns. However many 50 million dollars can buy. Nothing else, just clowns. 




 I jack off to magazines.

 My pubes have gotten so long and I am too lazy to trim them so now everything I wear is so uncomfortable.  




 "Say my name."
"... Helsingborg."
"You're goddamn right!" 




 I wouldn't punch him. It looks like life punched him and he never fully recovered. 




 I am a big fan of Louis CK, and I would love to know more about how he was on the set of parks and rec, as Dave. What is he like in person, and while working on a show? 




 Hey Amy, big fan. I was wondering who your main influences are as a comedian, who you wanted to be like when you were first starting out? 




 Christina Terranova, to be exact

 If Warner Brothers revives the Harry Potter franchise with a new storyline, are you going to be making an appearance?

 Thanks so much, buddy! 




 I just learned of this recently in my high school history class. At the Battle of the Granicus, Alexander the Great was about to be killed by Spithridates, a satrap, from behind. As his arm was striking, Cleitus the Black severed his arm just before he could deal the finishing blow. Cleitus the Black was a commanding officer of Alexander. I did a project on the battle. It was really like out of a movie. What's ironic is, later in Alexander the Great's conquest, he killed Cleitus in a drunken quarrel. 




 She's streets ahead if you ask me. 




 Thanks!
