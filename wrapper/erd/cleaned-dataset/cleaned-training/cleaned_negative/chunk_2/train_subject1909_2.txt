 What's with all the MIRs? I know what they are, that's not what I'm asking. Why does everything have a MIR right now? It isn't a holiday or anything.  




 Valve may have had custom parts that slightly differ from all the stock counter-parts. But I do agree. If a non-glorious non-peasant who wants to join PC just googles these things, sees the most expensive model available, then when they get the device it preforms like shit.   




 The fucking end all is 10x cheaper that those pieces of shit. an i3 for $1000+ dollars! WHAT!!

Stranger has disconnected. 




 Watch cory of course. The anime takes a completely different path from the mango. Don't worry 




 Yes! When I was a kid this game was the shit! By that I mean it was shit. I knew it was then. I was a HUGE Sonic fan. I loved the 2D games this was my first 3D "Sonic" game and I realized the 2D ones were so much more fun. Shadow was so mean I didn't like him. I wanted my nice happy hedgehog back :( 




 Yep 




 \V/ 




 180,000 




 My SM is around 180000 




 Thanks! 




 Right now I have a halberd and that knight guy's lightning sword. I also have found the secret you mentioned but thanks! 




 I've done the bird thing. I can't beat it.
I've gone to Heide's Tower. Can't beat it 




 I know where it is and I have visited it multiple times but I cannot get through it. I was hoping someone could join my game and help me. 




 Don't even list it. On valves website at the very bottom in tiny text there is a number that happens to be the app number so if you insert it it takes you the HL3 page... 




 The Pursuer and The Last Giant. 




 I need a little help. I'm not to good although I have beat the first two bosses but now I can't progress. I don't know what to do. Can anyone help? 




 I am not too good and DS. I need help with Heides Castle. If you would like to help PM me. Thanks! :) 




 I'm US/Canada Central Standard 




 I will and I do have a mic. My PS3 is in another room so I won't be checking this anymore ok? 




 In forest of fallen giants where that weird trader with all the crap on her back is.
How will we meet up though? Will you place one of the call sign things? 




 Yeah 




 Yeah... 




 I don't think I've beat any. xD 




 I don't really know how to judge how far I am. 




 MoonChap and 14690 (I started a few days ago) 




 It doesn't seem like to many people play PS3. Anyone want to play? 




 I do have a mic and would love to chat sometime. I'll try to add you. PS3's friend system is the worst 0.o 




 I have about 5000
I'll PM you username 




 I sent it 




 My PC can't run anything. I am playing on PS3.
I do have steam if we could chat over that so I could learn how to play the game that would be great. 




 Same god? What do you mean? 




 Soul Memory Range?
(sorry I know nothing, thanks for helping) 




 So if I wanted to play with someone, I would just have to wait around? 




 Any way I can invite someone or get someone to come help me? 




 How do I find a summon sign? 




 Second Boss?! Who the hell is the first boss?! 




 I know and I have been there and got pretty damn far until I'm in a city like place with shittons of blood stains and messages saying stuff like "Bravery Required Ahear" and "Don't fight alone" I wen't up a ladder and there is some crazy ass armored dude flying across the screen so I ran away so I didn't die. 




 I am new to DS as a series and started with Dark Souls 2. How do I get to play with someone? There are some enemies I can't beat without help. 




 Okay, so I'm definitely going Polaroid 




 Need help making a decision on a VERY interesting run. I started as Azazel now i have gilitine, holy water, holy mantle, revenge fly, that floating spider spawner thingey, and all together six maximum heart containers. I just killed mom. Do I go Negative or Polaroid?

 I REALLY need parts. Unfortunately they cost lots of money which I don't have. I have only upgraded my PC once. At the moment I have a Core 2 Duo, 1TB HDD (The only good bit) 4GB of memory, whatever the heck intel mobo that the pc came with, and Intel G41 Express Chipset. It can't run anything at more than 30 FPS. I never have had a good PC but I don't use consoles solely because I lack the money to buy the console or games, and they're awful. I have started a fund so any money I don't need goes in. Currently it is $25. I would cry tears of joy if I could win this card to help me ascend a little higher up. Thank You for reading OP. If you want to steam message me just PM me and I will tell you details. 




 This would have been a good post if you didn't use the term "gamer-girl" This makes it sound like you think you will get likes because you are a girl. If you just titled it "First PC Build to Ascend from Consoles" it would be a lot less annoying. Also, we can see your fingernails. We can tell you are a girl. 




 Okay, I don't really know what I was expecting. Thanks for the response. 









 So, I'm making a build. I have no money. There is no way on earth I can afford to buy it all at once. My PC ATM is really awful.
(Intel Core 2 Duo E7400 @ 2.80GHz, Intel G41 Express Chipset, 4.00GB Dual-Channel DDR2, Intel Corporation DG41RQ) and I am going to make an upgrade... eventually. I am going to buy the parts one by one and slowly replace my pc. (Like that boat paradox, if you know what I'm talking about) I want to buy parts that can replace my parts now until I have replaced every part. Can you guys help me pick really cheap parts that are usable and that could fit in my pc now? 

Sincerely, someone whos pc is still better than a console but still is shit, Michael... 




 pm me? 









 Think about what you are doing. There are starving peasants in Africa that can't get a pc because amazon and new egg don't ship to Africa and you are talking like what you have is bad. Shame on you. (btw when you upgrade can you give me parts?) 




 I'm pretty sure that's my best buy o.0 




 Throw away that shit mod brother. I too have an awful computer. This is the mod that lets me play this great game. http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/15123/? 




 For those who don't know the three dollar bill gives you the rainbow tears. Do you guys love it or hate it. With this item there isn't really an in between. I believe the item is great if you git it at the beginning of a run. From Middle/End, it is unpredictable and will probably get you killed eventually. 




 It takes me at most 2 hours. If Portal took you 5 hours Portal 2 will take you 10. 









 My favorite doctor is the newest, Peter Capaldi. He just came on the scene and I am already in love with him. His character is more dark and powerful than the other doctors, so you never know what he is going to do. Claras character perfectly compliments his, always keeping him in check and often taking matters into her own hands. The writing this season has been a little chiche but is still great. Capaldi is making Doctor Who better no matter what the 9 year old girls say who hate him because he is old.

I've been wanting Shovel Knight for a while, but whenever I had the money, it wasn't on sale so I bought something else that was cheaper so I could get more bang for my buck. Now it is on sale and I don't have the money .


 




 books. People are making unofficial minecraft books. Go to walmart and you can find a ton of them. It is pretty awful how many there are.  









 Wanna all join the fun maps server? 




 In a few years. Everyone will play on the NerdCubed fan servers. There will be a documentary about our accomplishments. And the stars of it? Captain_Cone, Hendlton, train_subject1909, Divexz, and account-temp. (Probably not account-temp. His name isn't classy enough) 




 Yes! PM each other our steam names? 




 TF2 is still really popular, yet I haven't seen one person on the servers in a long time. 




 I believe I am practicing patience. Three years of patience and peasantry.  




 I even picked out the whole build. It was steal crap but we don't have money.  How many years until I can join the glorious master race. 




 The college kids get a free scholarship and books and tons of other stuff.  It's unfair that someone gets a scholarship for throwing a ball when they don't care about education at all. While intelligent children are going to low quality community colleges. 









 I haven't had the money to spend on games but now I do. Should I wait until it goes on a bigger sale or get in now?
