 Yes folks this is an alt account(My main was shadowbanned), yes I'm too lazy to make a new meme.  




 I often see stocks taking big dives or surging but am unable to locate any news to go along with it from sources like the AP or CNN.  Is there some source most novice investors don't know about or don't have access to that the professionals do?
