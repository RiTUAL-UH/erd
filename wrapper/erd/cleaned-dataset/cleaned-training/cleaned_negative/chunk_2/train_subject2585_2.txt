 I kinda enjoyed the ending, you deserve to have some fun. Although i'm puzzled on how the heads didn't rot. 




 What the fuck, what is wrong with your dad 




 As interesting as it is I don't get, there wasn't enough clues or anything like that. 




 How the hot dog am I suppose to a see a blue glow if I haven't already and people who haven't read this might stay away from it because they don't know why it glows. How am I gonna drag my family to the mountains, they're not gonna believe me oh ho ho she made another horror story. Not intending to be rude either, but i'm just saying. 




 Dude that's messed up, but I hope to hear more of your story soon. 




 Zombie, OOooh what if she's a zombie 




 Well all I can say is..... what? I can't even right now, just what, what. 




 I would have locked my door, ran into the closet with the gun, and had the police on speed dial. 




 Yeah, were you?
 




 I was thinking the same thing 




 She's too adorable! Awww the feels. 




 You should have smashed those garden gnomes or at least buried them.
 




 What how could you leave her like that? Even if she was freaking out you would have been better off with her. 




 Wait, wait, wait so these things are actually real? 




 Nope just evil nurses.
