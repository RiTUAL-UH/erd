 Mine is an 08. 














 Your friend, sir, is a bad ass. 









 Congrats man stay strong! 




 I'm so sorry for your loss.  









 I'm 27. Legend of the hidden temple was a popular gameshow for kids in the early/mid 90s. 




 As someone who comes from an entirely Jewish family, I just want to say thank you. 














 Captain Power and one of his nemeses (whose name I cant remeber...lord dread, maybe?) 




 Yeah I'm on medication. It took years to figure out what worked. But life is pretty good now. I hope your friend gets the help he needs. Tell him I'm rooting for him. I'll definitely let you know if I get his drawing as a tattoo. Does he have any other drawings? 









 You are truly a saint.
