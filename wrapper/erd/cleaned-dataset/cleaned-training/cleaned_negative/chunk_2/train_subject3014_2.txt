 Comment for later 




 I guess it depends on where you live. Pretty much all of the schools near me have drug/bullying problems, nothing major but enough to garner attention. The short time I did go to a "real" school wasn't bad at all though. In fact I rather enjoyed the whole experience! All my friends who were home-schooled and went to school are very happy. 




 When I was younger my parents had a lot of input about what I was doing for school work. These past couple of years I've been overseeing myself mostly. No tutors per say, but my mom knows a lot of teachers and she sometimes gets them to do something like, a weekly math class for a month or so. 




 Worth it? Just from interacting with teens your own age everyday? It's cool that you stayed home-schooled for so long, a couple of my friends decided to go to school a little younger than that. Most of them went to school at around 11 or 12 years old 




 I am 16 and I'm from The United States of America. Sorry about that, I'll add that to the description!

 Melee (weapon) as Mlee

Bichon Fris (dog) as Becon Fise, and before that I used to call them "Bacon Fries". 




 I heard you had an incident with a soybean field when you were younger, is this true? 




 I guess I'll have to buy a gamepad now... Dangit valve 




 I've got no game pad, guess I can't be part of the beta :( 




 We can only hope they actually release the third announcement.... 




 Me, in an orange t-shirt and brown shorts playing tag with my cousins. I remember this because it was *the moment* I realized I existed. I know it sounds weird, but at that moment I stopped playing for a second and thought: "I'm here"

I then went on to win that game of tag. 




 The fact that no one knows if there's an afterlife of any kind. Thinking about this used to REALLY freak me out when I was younger, I mean full on panic attacks. It still makes me sick to my stomach when I think about it now.

We don't know and we'll never know what happens to our souls/thoughts when we die. 




 How much did you have to be goaded in doing an AMA? 




 Finally! Me and my cousin have been making weird and wonderful flavor combos for ages. We've tried at least 2 dozen different things. Some of our favorites include  


  Potato chips + Cake frosting  
Jell-O + Mashed potatoes   
Asparagus + Raspberry jelly  
Bananas + Maple syrup  
Tomatoes + Baked Beans  

And cinnamon, lots and lots of cinnamon. We put that on almost everything: Pizza, salad, eggs, soup, sandwiches, hamburgers and even on fruit! 
 




 This very much reminded me of [The Pearl] (http://lostpedia.wikia.com/wiki/The_Pearl) station from Lost 




 Oh! This is actually the one I was looking for! 




 Cool. Thanks for the information! 




 [This] (http://candies.aniwey.net/) game and this [one.] (http://orteil.dashnet.org/experiments/cookie/) They're not exactly point and click type games. I'm not sure if there is a genre for this kind of game. 




 Oh, I didn't know that! Thanks!
