 I think you posted the wrong link as the HL doesn't match link story. 




 I have noticed that short HL's get more attention. I suspect this is because of the short attention span most of us exhibit here at reddit.   




 I assume you're directing that to the writer of the article "Adrin Blomfield" since I plagiarized the HL from the article I can not in good conscience accept your complement. But I can up vote you. 




 How do you know that it's not a guy?

 unix and some databases store their dates as an "epoch date" which is the number of seconds since Jan 1, 1970.
If a date field ends up as just zeros, that date would get interpreted as Jan 1, 1970 00:00 GMT. And when it gets adjusted to your particular time zone, that throws it back into the previous day.
