 *Sigh*

Father Magoo would rather not bother Himself with such trivialities. 




 My Son, what do you mean by "love"? 




 *Sigh*

Please, my Son, hold your tongue. You are speaking in the presence of a Father.

A Father Magoo.

...

Father Magoo has spoken.

     "In the Realm of the Garden of Men and Manlets, Father Magoo has spoken. So it is. So it shall be. " 




 *Sigh*

...

Yes, my Son. 




 200mg Ephedrine, 2 grams of caffiene, handful of aspirin pills.

So it is Written. 




 Put the knife down, my Son. This is not how you become a Magoo.

To answer your question, cut.  




 Thank you, my Son, for informing the Children of the Realm of the Garden of Men of this Atrocity. Father Magoo cannot keep all of His Children in line. It is too bad. I had high hopes that he would become a Magoo. 

*Sigh* 




 It warms My heart to see one of the Children of the Realm of the Garden of Men and Manlets become a Man. My Son, might Father Magoo ask you a question?

...

That was just a courtesy; I'm not asking. What college are you going to, my Son? 




 Please, my Son, stop this Trolling. Trolling will *not* be tolerated!

Father Magoo has spoken.

     "In the Realm of the Garden of Men and Manlets, Father Magoo has spoken. So it is. So it shall be. " 




 Children of the Realm of the Garden of Men and Manlets, Father Magoo has found it in His heart to bless you with his Presence. You may ask Him anything. 




 Please, my Son, stop this Trolling. Trolling will *not* be tolerated!

Father Magoo has spoken.

 "In the Realm of the Garden of Men and Manlets, Father Magoo has spoken. So it is. So it shall be. " 




 cool 




 *Sigh*

Please, my Son, hold your tongue. You are speaking in the presence of a Father. 

A Father Magoo.

...

Father Magoo has spoken. 

     "In the Realm of the Garden of Men and Manlets, Father Magoo has spoken. So it is. So it shall be. " 




 Father Magoo would never do this. 




 Go straight up to her face and say, "I wanna fuck you like an animal." Then grab her shoulders firmly, lick her face, and whisper in her ear, "I wanna feel you from the inside." 




 wait what friends  




 Goddammit all to hell. I thought my Geralt would have a threesome with Triss and Yennifer, but they decided to chain him up and leave him. They will pay! 




 get off reddit and play them all right now

...

right now

...

OP if you're still there, I will know that you have defied The Father Magoo. 




 Buy The Witcher 3 or I'm not Father Magoo 




 Goat Simulator  




 no this is Father Magoo

duh 




 almost as funny as the crossdressing elf 




 right in the pussy. 




 "And so it was written that on the third day of the sixth month of the two-thousand and fifteenth year after the birth of some dude, Orlitoq shall not have partaken of the entertainment form known to many as Witcher 3."

wait what 




 This depresses me, my Son. You are better than this. 




 My Son...

*sigh*

Please stop with the bad language. It does not suit you, my Child. 




 My Son, that set of quotation marks should go after the period, not before.  




 become a tranny and strut your stuff in dem high heels

...

wait don't really do this
 




 "Of the games in the Witcher franchise, I have played the first, and second, but not yet have I played the latest."

wait what 




 Nothing can kill Father Magoo. Not even Himself. Do not worry, Children of the Garden of Men. 




 wait what 




 My Son, I am not fucking emo.

My Children, please do not follow this Broscientologist's advice. 




 My Son, do not question the Actions of the Father. 

The Father Magoo. 




 "Of the three Witcher games, not all have been played by me; specifically the most recent."

wait what
 




 I am Father Magoo. 

What do you think, my Son? 




 "I own the first and second Witcher games, but have not yet bought, or played, the third."

wait what
 









 "Game not played yet: Witcher 3."

wait what 




 look yourself directly in the mirror (make eye contact with your reflection), and slap yourself as hard as you can while maintaining eye contact (make sure to be shirtless). repeat until self-confidence is gained.

/thread 




 I mean it looks like you crashed it... 




 "The game Witcher 3, I have not yet played it."

wait what 




 Say: "I wanna fuck you like an animal. I wanna feel you from the inside." 

It'll work.

Trust me. 




 ...

um...

...

I...

I don't...

*cries silently* 




 "There is a game which I have not yet played. It is called Witcher 3."

wait what 




 "I have not played Witcher 3 yet"

wait what 




 cool 




 "Have not played the game"

wait what 




 no. buy buy buy. must sink all money on dlc. 




 lolwhut 




 lolwhut 




 I saw this exceptionally hot woman (easy 10) at Trader Joe's and I stopped walking and just stared. I wasn't trying to stare; it was like she put me in a trance. I could not stop staring, and I've had dreams about her every night since the sighting. Has something like this ever happened to you? How do I stop the dreams? 




 "Daddy, can I have some of that stuff?"

*sigh*

"Son, you really shouldn-"

"PLEASE!"

*sigh*

"Alright, son. Alright." 




 #420gainzs 









 he's obviously a novice. only advanced cutters should be cutting their lower body. he better not take his cutting hobby too fast or he just might hurt himself! 




 lolwhut 




 I heard it really doesn't have much of a story. That's why I'm asking. 




 I just bought The Handsome Collection for my Xbox One, and am wondering whether or not to buy and complete the original Borderlands for the 360 before Borderlands 2. Also, the "Pre-Sequel!" is the prequel to Borderlands 3, not 2, right? 









 Do you only get an ability point, or do other things happen also? 














 it's digital  




 yes, the game is tied to your account, so you can download it on any xbox. 




 ,let me know! and if you've liked this and you wanna see more, click right here to see more! 









 but mommy says I'm "special" 









 Wolfenstein: The Old Blood

I'm playing it on the hardest difficulty and I'm only at 25% completion 10 hours in.

If you haven't played The New Order yet, get the Wolfenstein bundle. 









 lmfao 




 IIFYM  




 yes, both Metro games and Wolfenstein The New Order and its prequel The Old Blood are very good 




 Yep, just went on this sub to see if anyone else was having this issue. 









 Looks like there's going to be a "Disappointed Grandma" meme... 




 Yes, you count net carbs. 




 wait, I didn't know there was such a thing as too much alcohol... 




 no... 




 I lift alone, and if I fail a rep, I count on some random guy to spot me. I have no friends. *cries silently*  




 most of my calories are from an 8 ounce block of sharp cheddar cheese 




 you really don't need any supplements. just eat at a calorie surplus and run a good novice routine like ICF 5x5 




 Hold on just give me a sec while I check my urination log... 




 Cut definitely   














 Alexei Fyodorovich Karamazov. AKA: Alyosha, Alyoshka, Alyoshenka, Alyoshechka, Alexeichik, Lyosha, and Lyoshenka.  









 Yeah I like short women. They make me feel tall. hehe 









 Thanks. I will. 190-proof Everclear is very tasty. But I will use a chaser, of course (151-proof Everclear). 




 Thanks. This really means a lot. I'm actually suffering from a very serious depression, and was just about to slam a bottle of Everclear with a bottle of psychiatric medication, but this post stopped me. Now I know I'm good at something. I can't thank you enough. You saved my life. I promise to continue to shitpost until the end of my days. Thanks again. 









 I really don't want to be leaking cum all day.

I'm really sorry, but I can't help but laugh. 




 okie dokie  




 lol 




 I used to really like the show, but season 3 was a chore to watch. I mean seriously, the big cliffhanger is Claire telling Francis, "I'm leaving you." If this is not a soap opera, I don't know what is. 




 lolwhut 




 The only difference between bulking and cutting is diet (and maybe a slightly lesser workload when cutting, but that's about it). 




 keto 




 EC, injecting Everclear, that's about it 




 so I don't have to inconvenience myself with taking them off for anything except deadlifts?  




 either face the wrath of your teacher and get a failing grade, or use your "sick" days to get your act together. those are really the only two ways of going about this. 









 The Brothers Karamazov 




 Then go to a state where it is legal.

Use 151-proof Everclear as your chaser. 




 Rich Piana is 100% natty. Anyone who says otherwise is just jealous.  




 Yes, Prozac is fine, but make sure to take the whole bottle at once with a fifth of Everclear for optimal effectiveness.  




 190-proof Everclear. Drink it all.
 



















 my Son must be Resurrected. 



















 srs 



















 or will uninstalling make me lose all my progress? 














 It is life changing! 














 How dare they!!!! 




 A woman at a grocery store smiled at me and raised her eyebrows. Does this mean she's attracted to me?
 




 Seriously, there is no gameplay to be found whatsoever. 









 yeah let's pretend Judgement doesn't exist
