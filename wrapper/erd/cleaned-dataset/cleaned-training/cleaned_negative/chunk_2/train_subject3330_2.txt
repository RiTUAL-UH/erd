 Its your plans for the day using your preferred calendar.

If you have nothing on your calendar today then it will show no events. 

Create something for tomorrow at say 6pm and it will give you a notification / reminder close to that time. 

Or if you check your agenda manually with that option it will show up. 

TLDR; you have nothing planned in your calender today.

 Nothing... Nothing at all... that what gave her the time to come up with this. 




 Oh cool, yeah noticed the 4 horsemen show up after the first completion.

Wasnt aware there was more than that... The game doesn't really explain itself very well. 




 Yeah I got bored of it after a couple of hours.
Beat it a few times with different characters, tried out a bit of the items and combinations, did a few of the challenges... But it got old rather fast.

I'll go back to it every now and then I guess as it's still a fun time killer. 




 I liked the episode about steroids where Robbie eats these small spiky creatures to get buff and winds up covered in spikes and being super aggressive...

 Cook in bulk and freeze portions to take to work over three days, after that you should have enough to alternate between for the next week or two.  Saving you both time and money if you don't like to cook. 

If freezing doesn't work for you just make enough for the following day and keep in the fridge. Stirfrys, pastas etc are quick, cheap and offer plenty of variety. 

Or get up earlier than you usually would  to prepare a lunch. Sandwiches and the like. 

Not only will you save money and eat better, you'll also learn new skills in cooking which is always a good thing later in life. 

Limit yourself to buying lunch to once a week.

Don't like any of the above advice? Then continue with what you're doing. You'll either get another job making more money or you'll change your lifestyle.  




 This and limit yourself to one "big purchase" per month. No impulse buys. 




 Yeah that happens when you masterbate at your desk all day while wearing a pedometer on your wrist.

 For some reason it annoys me when people use the word peruse, as most of the time it's not used correctly...

 Peruse: 
examine carefully or at length. / read (something), typically in a thorough or careful way

So you read everything in the "on this day" or did you actually mean you skimmed through till you found something of interest? 




 You leave potato and Vodka on shelf for Father Frost to keep family safe.

Only no potato, must choose family member to sacrifice so other can live.

Such is life.

 Meh, I completed multiple playthroughs so I'm burnt out on the game.
Prob wont touch it again for quite a while.

Guess it's good news for those who havent played it or have been holding off waiting for a patch.

 Honestly, people will talk it up as being impressive but it is nothing more than using primitive shapes as a brush.

It's the same as using shaped brushes in any other software be it ms-paint or photoshop.

If you can use them you can do this. 




 I cant watch this while at work, will definitely check it out when I get home.

Is there anywhere I can check out all the submissions that didnt make it in? 




 When you kill one, it is a tragedy.

It'll be a course on how to search,  navigate and retrieve relevant information from the archives of the early Internet.

 I remember this being a short story, pretty sure I read it when I was a kid... Think it was by Paul Jennings or something like that?

 Google Wallet: Heres a neat feature, use it if you want.

Apple Pay: The future of money is here, you never knew you wanted this, this will change everything... so on and so forth. 




 Witnessing the Next Step in Money. Maybe.

There have been payment options with your phone via NFC etc. available for quite a while now, just because Apple is now entering the ring does not mean they are the best or on the forefront.

 Exactly, makeup is just fancy overpriced face paint. 




 Yeah I also ordered from Yatango as soon as it became available... Shortly after they changed the pricing upwards and demanded I pay the difference or cancel... Then they say the order is delayed for a further 30 days... then recently they said possibly another 30 days.

I cancelled, got a full refund then ordered from a Melbourne based ebay seller on Thursday for $300. It arrived yesterday. 

Yatango is horrible when it comes to importing.  




 You glorious bastard.

 The Apple watch is just the start

Uhh they're a bit behind there, Smart Watches have been around a while now, with the latest being the Moto360 touting Android Wear.

But hey, anything apple is on the forefront of technology right?
