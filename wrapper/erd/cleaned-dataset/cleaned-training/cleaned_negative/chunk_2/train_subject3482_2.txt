 There is no meaning to life.  There is only enjoyment, experience and  opportunity. 




 They openly admitted building 7 came down as a precaution, so it was planned.  In regards to flight 93, the official story is not believable.  You should add the "plane" at the Pentagon to your list.

 




 It would depend on whether or not your availability is limited because of them.  I was never limited because of them, so, they didn't come up in conversation. 




 This will not qualify as sexual abuse.  It is, perhaps, abusive in a different way.  Seems he used it more as punishment from what you've posted.

 Find a really good picture of them together and get a canvas made like [this](http://photos.walmart.com/walmart/storepage/storePageId=Wall+Art/).  They're fast and not expensive. 




 I know from personal experience that this works.  But keep adding the dark chocolate or else you'll end up a nasty slate gray like my aunt.  She's dead now but she's that same gray color.

 No, they left it out because you could still see the wires of the contortionist that did the scene.  They digitally removed it for the 2000 release. 




 I Spit on Your Grave is a controversial 1978 rape and revenge film. The film received a limited release, with a wider release in 1980. Prominent film critics condemned the film for its graphic violence and lengthy depictions of gang rape, and the motion picture remains controversial to this day. The film was named in 2010 one of Time's Top 10 Ridiculously Violent Movies.

Yeah, I'll pass on that one.

 I lived in Grants Pass for many years because I loved it so much.  It's a great place to raise a family.  The weather is great with no humidity.  Camping is fantastic and of course, the wild and scenic Rogue River.  And there are Dutch Bros. which I also like.

 It can be done, but it's more difficult and can get very expensive if there are two children.  Lots of housework, cooking, laundry, baths and such to do after you get home from work.  It's two jobs in one.  They're better off being raised by a loving parent. 




 You'd rather your children be raised by strangers than you or your wife?

 I've never thought it fair that only the rich can live in nice homes on the beach or in the most beautiful mountain-view areas.  Sometimes I think it would be more fair for people to switch every two years so we all get the opportunity to enjoy what the world has to offer sometime in our lives.

 I do not want my tax dollars going to sterilize someone because they need the money.  This is a terrible idea, with the next step being forced sterilization.  Birth control, not sterilization, is the answer.

 There is absolutely no need to surveille, record and store the personal and private business of hundreds of millions of citizens for the potential actions of a few.  There is no guarantee whatsoever that they will observe any citizens' rights now, or in the future.  They aren't observing the laws now and are lying to us about it.  If you trust what any politician tells you then you deserve what you will get.

 Stop reading the news.  Just stop yourself from receiving all the negative input that we're bombarded with every single day.  It can become overwhelming.  Take a vacation from it.  Knowing all the bad things going on in the world serves no practical use in our everyday lives.  Put yourself to some good use. Volunteer somewhere, take a class at college just because you like the subject. I don't know, just do some things that you enjoy.  Now, about death; it doesn't matter that we're all going to come to the end of this existence, what matters is that you're here now and you got the opportunity to live, love, do, go and just be.

 He sits in his garage night after night waiting for me to come home.  As soon as I get out of my car he comes out into his yard and just watches me go inside, just like he does when I leave.  There's a window in his garage and I've peeked in when he's away.  On the table is a pair of binoculars.  This is why I have a 95 lb. German Shepard.  Just try to come inside creepy, white-haired blubber man, I double dare you.

 After spending two days writing a fantastic proposal where time was of the essence, I finished it and handed it my supervisor, sure we'd the contract because it was that good.  After hearing nothing for two days, I finally inquired about its' acceptance.  His response was, "Oh, yeah, that.  I haven't read it yet, but next time for sure." 




 James Rosen, chief Washington correspondent for Fox News spied on by the Justice Dept. here - http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/05/20/james_rosen_spied_on_his_case_is_even_worse_than_the_ap_reporters.html

CBS confirms reporter Sharyl Attkissons computer breached here - http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-06-14/lifestyle/39967790_1_cbs-news-computer-intruder

No, you aren't wrong, it isn't confirmed.  However, "the intrusions were detected in December while Attkisson was reporting almost exclusively on the governments response to the terrorist attacks on the U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya.  Attkisson has previously investigated the Justice Departments gun-tracking operation known as Fast and Furious. 




 Remember Sharyl Attkisson, the reporter who was spied on?  There's an abuse of the system by the Justice Dept. 




 That's the scariest thing I've read all day.  Remember, we are not all equal in intelligence, competence, critical thinking skills or emotional control.  No way would I join the local militia group. 




 We have a right to know about any information collected on us, with or without our knowledge.  Maybe Snowden figured making this info available to us is what it was going to take to wake up America.  He was right, and I consider the release of this information, at great potential harm to himself, to be an act of honor on his part. 




 This flag is not a cross that represents any of those things.  Your ideas do not relate to my statement at all. You can ascribe anything you want to them, it doesn't change their representation or use.  Perhaps you need to stop judging things based on centuries old practices. 




 How do church crosses in any way relate to this flag or have a bad history?  Church crosses represent belief in a religion, nothing else should be ascribed to them.

 Some groups use the Southern Cross as one of the symbols associated with their organizations, including groups such as the Ku Klux Klan.  According to Civil War historian and native Southerner Shelby Foote, the flag traditionally represented the South's resistance to Northern political dominance; it became racially charged during the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s, when fighting against desegregation suddenly became the focal point of that resistance.

 They do this every year in Aug./Sept. but they're moving everything up these days to take advantage of end-of-year sales. 




 "For better or worse" was the promise you made.  Wait until things are better for her and then make an adjustment in your relationship.  Then you can both pursue your different paths. 




 Yeah, some days are harder than others, but through sheer determination I trudge along.  I know this is a temporary thing and something will change eventually.  I look forward to that, but luckily I'm a stubborn one and won't let it get the best of me. 




 Feelings of failure or inadequacy keep us looking back.  Why did they leave me?  Why wasn't I good enough?  What did I do wrong?  Could I have fixed it?  When in reality, it was probably nothing specific we did.  We're different people as we grow and change and aren't always suited to each other during certain phases of our lives.  There's probably something in a past relationship you miss and look to remind yourself of.  Just because we aren't with them doesn't mean the feelings disappeared.  It's ok to look back every now and then, just remember you're not who you used to be and have grown since then. 




 Work part-time and do both.  That way you can raise a healthy family, have a happy marriage, keep your sanity and contribute in the workplace the way you want to. 




 Never, ever get personally or intimately involved with a coworker.  Just count it as illegal in your life.
