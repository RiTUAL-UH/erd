 First slap my wife has given me. 

Newly married huh :) ? 




 Hi Ralph 




 Hi Ralph 




 hi Ralph 




  Sound like you narrowed it down.Never skimp on the psu.What psu from amazon out of curiosity?

https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00ALK3QRS/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8 psc=1

I know the TX/HX line are said to be better, but that was about my budget limit (the PSU that popped was a super-cheap Winpower 750W that lasted 5 years+).  




  Did the computer just start actiing up,or did it act up from the get go with the new psu.Reason I ask is that the blown psu may have damaged the mobo.

That's my worry. The PC was fine, then the PSU blew up, so I ordered another, THEN it started randomly shutting-down/powering up only after fitting the new PSU. I've ran a full memtest86+ scan, the RAM passed, no errors. No HD errors, temperatures are all fine, benchmarked the video-card, checked Event Viewer, no problems. So I'm hoping it's a bad PSU (Amazon are sending me another tomorrow), but my big worry is something on the mobo or CPU is damaged. If I have the same reboot problem after a 2nd new PSU I guess it's time for a new mobo :( 




  .Do you have a multimeter.Google paperclip psu test.I wouldint continue using the psu untill tested properly.Do you have another psu to see what happens

No multimeter I'm afraid. And no, no spare PSU, this is a replacement for the unit that blew up (PC suddenly powered off, on restart there was a loud crack   a smell of smoke). I'll look up the paper-clip test, thanks :) 




 Edit: replacement PSU works fine (4 days uptime so far)

Win 7 64 Pro, Gigabyte  GA-EP43T-UD3L mobo, Corsair  CX750M modular PSU. 3 X SATA drives (1 is SSD), 1 SATA DVD burner. SIW/BIOS/SpeedFan shows the +12V line is outputting only 0.83-2.5V http://i.imgur.com/BSbIh6Y.png. Temperatures normal, all sockets reseated/checked.

  Are the mods actually going to enforce the rules here? 

yup, removed, thanks for letting us know 




 I'm flattered :) 



















 well there was a phone-booth handy,   I felt like a change ... tada, "The Janitor" 




 we try to avoid that word in here :) 




 too complex a search-term, just use "power", sort by new, voila :) Reddit search isn't as intuitive as Google

  A rule was introduced a year or two ago hat users are only allowed to mod three default subs. The exception to the rule is /u/train_subject3554

4 defaults, not 3, and yes I WAS exempt from that rule (to handle spam), but admin reversed their decision and made me drop defaults until I now only moderate 4 defaults

  Regenerative braking takes the kinetic energy and turns it back into electricity which is stored in the battery by using the motor as a generator, instead of wasting it all as heat you get to recover some of the energy you've used

TIL, thank you so much :) 




  but on a hill climb they're going to be doing a lot of quick acceleration followed by braking, which I assume is regenerative

how could braking be regenerative (I'm genuinely curious/ignorant)? 




 mwahaha, reload my comment, I (coincidentally) amended it as your reply came in 









   now this post is at an end,

 yup, but he's stepped down from some subs, claiming pressure of work,   I'd hate to lose mod_mailer, it's so darn useful 




 excellent, can you do the same for mod_mailer now please :) ?

 I feel exactly the same, the lags on my 2012 Nexus 7 with Lollipop is terrible. If I factory-reset to kitkat is there any way of blocking the final update to lollipop?  Because even the notification that lollipop was ready to install seemed to cause my tablet to lag

edit: just got 5.1 OTA   my tablet is MUCH more responsive!
