 Losing two weeks of data collection during a critical research period or two weeks of a key experiment that took months or years to set up will have repercussions for years

...And I thought shutting off the National Zoo's panda cam was bad.   




 It's crazy that a guy like Culberson can be so into NASA and yet so ignorant when it comes to environmental science.  









 I feel like a story about gecko-inspired gloves comes out every month. But apparently this one actually works (!). Crazy video.

 "We look at these old Archaean crusts, for instance, and we dont see the features that characterize subduction," Rey says.

It's a model that confirms physical evidence. Read the article (and the study, for that matter).  














 Yup. The NASA Centennial Challenge might help them fix that...
