 Its just a question of being smart and not inviting trouble. i used the strap on my camera to attach it to my forearm for safety, but its more important just to not draw attention to yourself or invite unwanted trouble. If you look like a tourist, you are a target. If you look like a seasoned travel without a penny to your name, people ignore you. Just don't make it obvious you own valuable things! 




 That is generally the rule, but I actually really like Kathmandu! I was followed by a drug dealer (they are depressingly common in the sub-continent) and I'm sure the intention was to rob me as westerners are generally assumed to be rich wherever you go! 




 Thank you!  




 Networking with other travellers is easy, in generally most travellers eat and sleep in the same places and are usually very willing to chat to new people and share stories, experiences or advice! Most international travellers use English as a common language, so it helps if you are fluent!

Do you mean you are from South-East Asia, or you want to travel South-East Asia? I've tried my best to give good advice on most things in this thread, have a read of some of my comments, I hope they help! Feel free to ask any other questions though, I am happy to share advice with others who want to see more of the world! :) 




 haha, agreed! I have tried food from all over this world and New York Pizzas do kick ass!! They don't quite measure up to Cambodian chicken sandwiches though! France is probably slightly cheaper than the UK, both are expensive but France is nicer. Both the English and the French are rude as a rule, so watch out! Thats party why I moved to New Zealand, the people are actually friendly here!! 




 Thanks! You don't need to worry too much about travelling if you are a young woman though, I answered another couple of questions along those lines. Basically it is safe in most parts of the world to travel solo as a woman, in some places though you should be a little more mindful of how you dress, i.e minimum bare skin and nothing tight fitting or revealing, and just be a bit more mindful about where you go (stick to crowded or busy places) and where you go at night. These are just basic safety precautions anyway, you just need to pay a little extra attention if you are a woman. Lots of young women do travel solo though, so don't rule it out! 

Happy travels! :)

I hope you find it useful, I am happy to offer advice to anyone planning some travel! 









 Thanks for the tip about the subreddits! I have answered lots of questions about what you want to do, read a few of my comments and that should answer most of your questions! I am happy to offer advice though! South East Asia is a good call, check out Thailand, Cambodia and Viet Nam. They can all be done on a budget but be warned, there is quite a bit of poverty, especially in Cambodia and the touts are sometimes quite aggressive, so it is not for the faint hearted.

Your parents are justified and right to be worried, it is a big deal! I am extremely grateful to my parents for supporting me and trusting me to have the brains and the balls to pull it off. World travel is not for everyone, you need to be an independent, self-aware person but you learn that while travelling. It is normal to feel overwhelmed at the start of a journey or trip, so watch out for that! Your parents are right to worry and you should be glad they do, they just need to be able to trust to you be smart and brave. 




 Depends where you are. If you're European then see more or Europe, if you are American or Canadian, go to New Zealand or the European mainland! If you are adventurous go to Thailand or Viet Nam! If you are reckless go to India!! 




 I travelled breifly accross America, I chose to spend my time and budget in Asia and New Zealand though. I went to New York and Los Angeles. I like New York and would go back. You couldn't pay me to go back to Los Angeles.

If you don't mind me saying, it is an unfortunate fact that a disproportionally low percentage of Americans bother with international travel, which is a shame. Of  course there is a lot to see in America, but more of your countryfolk should see more of the world, if you don't mind me saying! 




 No, sorry! If you think it would be worthwhile I could keep one next time! 




 It is worth seriously thinking about it! There are surprisingly good few reasons not to! If I could do it at 18 on such a small budget anyone can!! At least give it some serious thought, and I am happy to give advice! 




 No not really. You meet other travellers from all over the world all time and I made some great friends from all over the place! Obviously you miss your family and friends etc, but its totally worth it. Travelling alone does make you much more independent. 




 I didn't have one best place, I loved Wanaka New Zealand though, as well as Northern Viet Nam and Khumjung which is a tiny village deep in the Himalayas. The worst place I went was Los Angeles, easily, although New Delhi was no picnic. 




 One backpack is all you need. Just take a few changes of clothes and a medical kit, everything else is optional.

You are talking about 'inter-railing', you used to be able to get good prices but it is much more expensive these days, it depends on your budget. I never did europe by train so I don't know much about it, sorry! I got round most of Europe by flying, it can be done very cheap!  




 I haven't decided yet. I loved Asia so much I thought I might head back in that direction! 




 Nope! 




 Flights are the only expensive thing, but theres plenty of apps and websites and travel agents who can do you a good deal. Try the app Skyscanner if you have a smart phone. I personally wouldn't recommend the UK, but I am biased as I grew up there and just emigrated to New Zealand! Europe is awesome, lots and lots to see, but expensive. If you can afford it, try Italy, Germany, France and Norway. 




 I did it alone because it gave me much greater freedom and I didn't know anyone who wanted to go as far or travel as wide as I did!! Travelling alone gives you much more freedom, for example if you are bored of one town you can take a bus to wherever the hell you want, you don't have to get anyones agreement or permission. Besides, you meet so many people on the road I was never lonely for a second, and if you meet sufficiently cool people you can team up and travel with them for a while!

Make sure you pick a good travelling companion, time on the road can stress out even a close friendship! You need someone who understands and listens to your needs and above all will care about you if you are upset or ill. Expect arguments, don't let them ruin your travels!  




 I worked solidly from when I was 16 to just before I left just after I turned 18 




 1. The trip all told cost me around 6-7000 GBP

2. The trip lasted just over 9 months.

3. It depends where you want to go! I would hugely recommend New Zealand to anyone, it is as beautiful as it looks in LOTR films! I also loved Viet Nam and Laos. If you are a little more adventurous I would hugely recommend Nepal!

4. I have shared loads of tips in this thread, read a few comments. If you have any questions I haven't answered feel free to PM me!!

5. Meeting people really isn't difficult, I made some great friends with people from all over the world. Meeting fellow travellers is very easy as most tend to eat and sleep in the same places and all are keen to chat about shared experiences or share advice on where to go and not go. I also did my upmost to talk and help locals as much as I could, which is a lot more fun! I once spend an afternoon in Northern Viet Nam drinking Whiskey with a group of elderly men who couldn't speak a word of english, it was such a great laugh!!

6. I stayed in all sorts of places! stuck to hostels in western countries for the sake of my budget, in Asia guest houses are cheap and plentiful! I also stayed with locals in some places like Nepal, which was very cool! Staying safe is a matter of having the brains and the balls to avoid trouble and stand up for yourself if its unavoidable. I never got myself in too deep, I can look mean when I need to, which would have been hard to believe if you had known me before I left! You learn fast how to look after yourself when travelling alone, and it can be a very strange or seriously cool feeling knowing you are completely responsible for your own well being and no one on the same continent as you knows who you are or what your name is.

I hope this helps! If you have any other questions I am happy to answer them!! 




 I took as little as possible with me, in fact the thing that took up most room in my backpack was my medical kit! That is the most important thing, you will need bandages, malaria pills, rehydration sachets, more bandages, a good disinfectant like Iodine and some extra bandages. Other than that clothes(you don't need many, I took 2 pairs of shorts and 5 shirts), a good camera, a diary (writing a diary on the road is hugely rewarding, mine is now my most treasured possession) and a good book, which it is common practice to trade with other travellers once you have read it. 

I started planning simply by deciding that I definitely wanted to see the world and which bits of the world I wanted to see! I settled on a route that took me to New Zealand, South-East Asia and India. That was it for planning though, I deliberately didn't plan too much to give myself extra freedom to do what I like when I was there, best way to do it!

Travelling as a women isn't a problem, you can still go to most places without having to worry. There are a couple of extra considerations, like making sure you dress sensibly: Keep bare skin and tight fitting clothes to a minimum so as not to attract unwanted attention, and just pay extra attention to where you go after dark. This is being over-cautious to a degree, as almost everywhere is safe (or not abnormally unsafe) for women travellers, but maybe bare this in mind on the Indian sub-continent or Middle East. Also in many countries women are expected to dress modestly out of religious deference, but it always greatly got on my nerves when people looked down there noses at me for religious reasons.

If you want any more advice feel free to PM me! :) 




 I worked solidly from when I was 16 to when I was 18, it can be done very cheaply though if you shop around, the only things that cost any real money is flights and insurance (you **must** have insurance!!) I recommend South-East Asia if you haven't done much travelling before, its a lot of fun, theres plenty of other travellers and its cheap! 




 I stayed in all sorts of places, stuck to hostels while in western countries for the sake of my budget, but once in Asia guest houses are cheap and plentiful. In more remote places I stayed with locals, mostly in Nepal and India. Feel free to PM me! I am happy to give advice to people, I only got as far as I did thanks to the kindness and advice of others, so I am always happy to pay it forward! 




 Thank you, it certainly was an awesome experience, but instead of envying me, emulate me! If I can do it on such a small budget and at such an age, anyone can! Its is worth giving consideration to, and I would be happy to offer any advice! 




 It depends where you are. In many places giving gifts is considered a great compliment and a good way to repay a local for kindness shown. I gave all sorts of things as gifts, such as foreign currency, my photographs, my books and drawings I made while travelling. 




 My answer won't be what you expect, but the best meal I had on the road was a chicken sandwich and a sprite in Sihanoukville, Cambodia. I have no idea how they cook the chicken, but I have yet to have a tastier meal!! Kangaroo steak is also tasty, as is crocodile and yak meat. Do not eat snake, its disgusting!  




 Yes, I feel it changed me and my perspectives hugely. I was a much stronger, more independent man when I came back from travelling, all my old friends commented at one time or another how I had changed, apparently I had a stronger walk when I came home, which I was quite flattered by! I did gain a much better perspective on the world and what people can do to one another under certain circumstances. For me I reflected a lot on the nature of Capitalism and Religion, I won't rant about either but you certainly get a lot of perspective on both once you see enough of the world.

Plus I lost a ridiculous amount of weight, I barely existed by the time I got home! 




 It has been on my list for a long time, although it is slightly out of my budget. You should try Cambodia and Viet Nam! 




 I have several favourite experiences! Climbing through the Himalayas was incredible, Northern Viet Nam was also awesome, especially drinking with the locals who didn't speak a word of english! Travelling did change me enormously, I had a great deal more self respect when I got back and am much more independent now, plus being a lot more wise to how the world works in some places. You do look differently at western culture and capitalism after leaving it for an extended period of time! 




 I did try to do an AMA as an expat a few months ago but the mods deleted it! 

[Here is the New Zealand immigrations website](http://www.immigration.govt.nz/)

[Here is a list of employment areas they are currently seeking in New Zealand](http://www.newzealandnow.govt.nz/working-in-nz) 




 Nope! 




 roughing it just means eating basic food (you can eat very well in Asia on a minimal budget! The trick is to eat where the locals eat!) and basic accommodation. The cheapest room I stayed in was in Namche in Nepal, cost 50 ruppees, thats about 20 english pennies or 35 american cents. A little competition I sometimes played with fellow travellers was who had got the cheapest room. I always won! (I did tip extra when I left!)

I started in England and travelled to: USA, New Zealand, Australia, Thailand, Cambodia, Viet Nam, Laos, Thailand again, India, Nepal, India again, Doha, Italy, Vatican City, England 




 That was roughing it, but you can do some decent travelling on much less though! 




 It all came to around 7000 GBP, which isn't that bad considering. 

There were many times when I felt at risk, I injured myself in many crazy ways (falling off motorbikes   skateboards) I also swam with sharks and poisonous jellyfish (without meaning to, and came within 2 feet of a 12 foot Nurse Shark, no cages, nothing) I saw dead bodies in India with needles still in their arms and was followed by a drug dealer in Kathmandu, but the only place I genuinely feared for my life was when I got lost in Los Angeles at night. 




 I alright thanks 




 I was never bored! I explored wherever I was, read lots, met fellow travellers and locals etc. I would occasionally team up with other travellers to travel with for a while, sometimes I would deliberately stray off the beaten track! 




 Where are you going, where are you from? I actually wouldn't mind a travelling companion this time around, private message me if your interested! I will most likely be heading to South East Asia again or maybe India! 




 Thank you, I don't know you either but you just made me smile! 




 Not a huge amount of trouble. I broke a bone in my foot and added several scars to my skin, I also ended up in hospital in Laos but never had any legal trouble. I nearly got attacked in Kathmandu but I can look scary when I need to 




 I emigrated as I really loved the country and didn't see a future for me in England! Google 'WWOOF New Zealand', the idea is you work for anyone (usually farm owners etc) in exchange for food and shelter. Great if your low on cash and an excellent way to meet very cool people! I actually originally came here on a working holiday visa myself, although I used WWOOF rather than get paid work, as if you get a job somewhere you still have to pay for somewhere to live and food etc. I live in Wellington and there are plenty of jobs about though, useful websites are [seek](http://www.seek.co.nz/) or [trademe](http://www.trademe.co.nz/jobs) 




 What I did depended on where I was and how I was feeling. Sometimes I would team up with other travellers, sometimes I would deliberately go off the beaten track. I made a habit of talking to locals as much as I could wherever I was and made some good friends from all over the world! I would usually stay in a place 2 or 3 nights until I got restless then ask other travellers or locals where they recommend I go next, its a cool way to live! To counter culture-shock or homesickness I would usually try to eat western food about twice a week and kept in touch by email with people at home. I got hooked on chicken sandwiches in South-East Asia, I have no idea how they cook them but I have yet to have a meal that tastes better than a chicken sandwich in Cambodia!!

Yes I am from England originally, but I live in New Zealand now. Are you American or Canadian? My advice before going to London would be to abandon any romantic ideas about the place, its hardly a land of fairytales! I never liked going to London, although there are a few places worth seeing, like the museums and Tower of London etc. My advice would be to see a bit of England outside London, I grew up in the countryside in a county called Norfolk, I recommend it! Stephen Fry is also from Norfolk! 




 My parents were actually very supportive, for which I am hugely grateful! Theres not many parents that would let there kids hit the road on their own (and in all fairness, its not something anyone can do), but my parents trusted me to have the brains and the balls to get it done and supported me throughout, for which I am grateful beyond words. 




 If you ever go to Thailand, watch out! Not all is as it seems... 




 I worked pretty much solidly from as soon as I was 16 until just before I left when I was 18. All told the trip cost around about 7000 GBP. It can be done a lot cheaper though, you could travel South East Asia on a shoestring budget without much trouble, as well as India, although prepare for serious culture shock! The only expensive things are flights and travel insurance (you have to have travel insurance!!) but you can get good deals on both if you shop around! 




 Thanks! What sort of non-touristy things? 




 Haha, cheers! I deliberately didn't plan ahead so I could move as freely as possible, stayed for about 3 months in New Zealand, then about a month a piece for everywhere I went in Asia. I would stay in one town or city for 2 or 3 days, then ask other travellers where they recommend I go next! 




 Ah brilliant, good tip! I have been researching doing a trans-siberian rail journey, and have always wanted to visit Ulaan Bataar! Any advice you could give me would be very much appreciated!! 




 I went travelling after leaving college (I'm english, college means something else in America) then went to University afterwards. I've just finished uni.

Yes travelling does pretty much force you to grow up fast, especially if you are travelling alone. It is a strange feeling knowing you are entirely responsible for your own well being and that no one on the same continent as you knows your name or who you are. I became extremely independent and had a great deal more self respect when I got home. People said I had a different, stronger walk when I came home, which I found quite flattering! I suppose world travel does look good to a perspective employer, shows that you are a very organised, self-reliant person. I've never really thought about it from that perspective!

My parents were actually really supportive, which I am hugely grateful for! I know many parents wouldn't dream of letting their child loose on the streets of Asia alone, but my parents trusted me to have the common sense and balls to pull it off. I cannot put into words how grateful I am to them for that. 




 I'm a guy, I answered a couple of other questions about the difference between travelling as a guy than as a girl, you can still travel almost anywhere if your a girl, just as long as your smart and don't take unnecessary risks or attract unwanted attention.

My coolest experience...thats not an easy thing to answer!! Trekking in the Himalayas was unbelievable, you can't even imagine what it's like until your there! Exploring the Angkor temples was pretty epic, and jungle trekking near the Burmese/Thailand border was pretty awesome as well! Good to hear your planning a trip, if you feel like you could do with some advice feel free to PM me, I only got as far as I did thanks to the kindness of others so I like to pay it forward! 




 Hmm, I would actually advice against moving somewhere without seeing more of the world, its actually not a good idea as you probably have romantic ideas about what its like then when you get there you will probably be disappointed. So many people go to India then leave after 2 or 3 days because of this, I know someone who booked a 6 month trip to India, then went home after 48 hours!! Culture shock is a real thing and it can be huge, especally if you haven't ventured outside the western world!

I recommend you and the Mrs take a holiday in Thailand, Google Koh Samui or Koh Chang, it would be an awesome trip for you and wouldn't be too huge a culture shock! 




 Its not advisable, I'm sure pictures exist somewhere though! bribes weren't big, $2 here, $5 there. 




 I didn't spend much time in America, I chose to spend more time exploring Asia. I visited New York and Los Angeles. I would go to New York again, you couldn't pay me to go back to Los Angeles! 




 There probably aren't many good reasons why you can't still do it! You don't have to be gone for years and it can be done quite inexpensively these days! I would definitely encourage you to at least think about taking a trip, you don't have to go round the world, just venture outside your comfort zone, you will find it so rewarding!

Language barriers weren't really an issue, my trick was to learn the basic phrases like "hello" "thank you" "yes" "no" etc when i went to a new country, but most people at least understand basic english or sign language. One of my fond memories from the road was drinking in a remote roadside 'bar' (for want of a better word) in Viet Nam drinking whiskey with a group of old Vietnamese men. We had no clue what the other was saying but had a brilliant laugh anyway!  




 I actually bought myself an SLR while travelling, and I'm very glad I did! I got a Lumix DMC-FZ28, ideal for travelling as its compact, hardy and does all the usual photographical tricks without any extra bulk or gear. Taking a huge DSLR and a massive lens is totally pointless as it is pretty much guaranteed to get lost, stolen or damaged, but travelling with a camera is a must, especially if you have an eye for taking good photos, and there are plenty of compact, inexpensive cameras out there, like my trusty Lumix! 




 I meant being given preferential treatment because I was white was very uncomfortable. 




 Well obviously I couldn't go everywhere I would have like on my time frame and budget. I visited: USA, New Zealand, Australia, Thailand, Cambodia, Viet Nam, Laos, Thailand again, India, Nepal, India again, Doha, Italy, Vatican City, England. 

By "around the entire world" I meant in a literal sense I circumnavigated the globe, not visit every country or continent. 




 Yeah, it is a pretty accurate depiction of *aspects* of India, although obviously nothing is like experiencing these things for yourself. 




 I would definitely encourage you to at least seriously consider travelling! You're only young once and the world is worth seeing!!

Things to consider: obviously cost is a big factor. How much you have depends where you can go and for how long, places like India and parts of South East Asia are cheap enough once your there, but flights and travel insurance (you have to have travel insurance!!) are pricey, not to say you can't get good deals though!

If you can get yourself to Bangkok though, you're sorted! Travelling south-east Asia isn't difficult as plenty of westerners do it so its very easy to meet other travellers and see lots of awesome things, most people understand english and travel options are plentiful and cheap! India is also a cheap and rewarding place to travel, although it most certainly is not for the faint hearted. You can expect a big culture shock when arriving in India and if you fly into Delhi or Mumbai expect to hate it passionately at least for the first day or two. Once you get out of the cities though there is a huge amount to see and lots to experience!

If you happen to be female you need to take a few extra considerations, mainly just obvious things like be careful how you dress and where you go at night. Generally though keep bare skin and tight clothing to a minimum and stick to crowded places are good advice, and being female is not a good reason not to travel, plenty of women travel solo without a problem, just avoid certain arabic countries such as UAE or Qatar, who regrettably still have a very medieval attitude to women.




Obviously there are loads more things to consider with something this big, if you have any questions feel free to PM me though and I will do my best to answer! I only got as far as I did because of the kindness of others, so I feel its important to pay it forward! 




 Tough one to answer, probably either the Himalayas, the Taj Mahal or Angkor.  




 Keeping in touch via email or the internet is pretty easy and most places have a connection. Obviously you miss people being away for so long but its so worth it and you become far more independent when travelling alone. 




 Touts. buying souvenirs is usually okay from street venders, but never book hotel rooms or any kind of travel arrangements from anyone who is not either employed by the hotel/travel bureau or travel agency. Also you should never buy anything or give money to child beggars. This sounds awful I know, but the gruesome fact is in a lot of places children are deliberately denied and education and forced into poverty as child beggars earn more money. In some places children are even deliberately disfigured or blinded, it can be genuinely upsetting and disturbing.  




 Its usually pretty clear when someone wants bribing, but important not to offer a bribe to the wrong person, that can land you in serious trouble! Certain places it is simply expected, on the border between Laos and Viet Nam it is the norm, there are even hand-writen signs up saying how much standard bribes are. Bribes are only necessary for tourists though. In some places it is the opposite, for example on the border between Nepal and India being white gets you a lot of preferential treatment, the border guards refused to search my guitar bag, because I was white. I was on a local bus and one of only 3 other white people, it was a seriously uncomfortable experience! 




 I worked solidly from when I was 16 to when I was 18. It was a relatively cheap trip, cost me about 7000 GBP all told. 




 Nice one, 14 months is pretty hardcore!! I've not decided yet, I'm either booking a flight to Delhi or Bangkok then going to make it up from there! 




 Thats a valid question, yes I am a man. It's an interesting point, in a lot of places your gender doesn't make a difference, but unfortunately in some places it does. For example, in India I travelled for a short time with a girl I met while travelling, and when we went into a shop or to a market together, the shop owners would only address me, even if she asked a question, the norm being that as a man, even though we barely new each other and were the same age, I was still responsible for her, because she was a girl. It was very strange. In most of the world (the exceptions being those governed by religious bodies such as many arabic countries) it is safe to travel as a woman, although obvious more care must be taken on matters of clothing and personal safety. If you happen to be a woman and planning some travel of the beaten path, always wear sensible clothing and nothing skin tight, and be sure to pay attention to where you go and when, i.e sticking to crowded places and be careful where you go after dark. It is an unfortunate state of affairs that this is still the case in some places, but it is important to be mindful of these things nonetheless. 




 Europe is cool, but very expensive!! Cheap accommodation is very hard to come by in most of Europe, especially the parts that are considered 'touristy'. I try not to use any networking sites while travelling, I find it is best just to talk to other travellers about where to go, what to do etc. It depends how much you want to spend and how comfortable you want to be, for Europe I recommend the website laterooms.com, usually good for finding cheap hotels etc. Places of the beaten track... try Norway, especially the north (make sure you go in summer!) and Bruges. Depends what you want to see!  




 All the predictable stuff. You have to provide a police check (and have a clean record) and proof of any qualifications you have. If you are deemed valuable (for example have good qualifications or useful skills) it is easy enough to get a residency visa. You have to remain a resident for a few years, during which you have to work, then you get full citizenship. I am still just a permanent resident of New Zealand, I think I have to do some kind of test in a year or two before I am aloud to be a citizen.  




 My long term goals fit quite easily around my travelling, as I try not to have any long term goals other than be happy! After I finished travelling I went to University in England whilst at the same time starting my emigration process to New Zealand. Now my emigration is underway and education is finished and I have a spare bit of cash on the hip, I decided to hit the road again!

Okay, a list of countries I visited in order, I started in England by the way: USA, New Zealand, Australia, Thailand, Cambodia, Viet Nam, Laos, Thailand again, India, Nepal, India again, Doha, Italy, Vatican City, England.

Epiphanies, excellent question! a lot of people ask similar questions about travelling, usually something along the lines of "did you find yourself". This is a misunderstand of what travel is about (usually spouted by people who spend a summer in Australia or Florida and then say they '*found themselves*'). It is true that during travelling you can, or have to develop a totally new persona, especially if travelling alone. It is also true that if you stray far enough from the beaten path and explore not only the beautiful, but also the grotesque and the despicable, you do start to ask certain questions about the human psyche, good and evil and, in my case, the nature of religion. So in a broad interpretation, with enough time on the road you can discover more about the workings of the mind and the parameters of your own sanity. However, the one thing the people who talk of discovering themselves fail to take into account is what happens if you dont like the man you find? 




 I used an international credit card, easy enough to get! It is always important to keep a stash of a few different currencies though, just in case! 




 The Great Pyramids of Giza, as they are the only one of the seven wonders of the ancient world that still exist! 




 It can be, I managed to do it relatively stress free. The emigration process takes a long time (obviously it varies country to country) but the biggest issue I faced was shipping all my stuff across the world and saying goodbye to important people I left behind. Its easy enough to stay in touch though and shipping stuff can be easy enough, depending how much money you can spend on it! 




 Nah its not more expensive, it all depends on how you do it! If you are willing to sacrifice **ALL** your creature comforts it can be done quite cheap, depends where you go!

The most remote place I reached was tiny isolated mountain villages in the Himalayas, one called Khumjung and another called Tengbouche, which has a famous monastery. It was a wonderful place to be, the scenery was just beyond imagination, it was breathtaking (literally as there was only 30% normal O2 levels at times!)

Visas are easy to sort out, the only countries I visited that demand visas in advance were India ($60 US in advance) and Viet Nam ($40 USD in advance) Usually just showing up on the border and bribing the border police works (I once had to bribe the same border guard twice on the border between Viet Nam and Laos!) I have a british passport which is still well respected, its not hard to sort visas out. The only thing is if you have an Israeli stamp in your passport a lot of Arab countries will not allow you a visa, so watch out for that! 

Language barriers are easy, you simply learn a few useful phrases like hello, thank you, yes, no etc but english is a universal tongue, most people will understand what you are saying if you are patient.

My emigration process to New Zealand has been fairly smooth, although they have just changed the rules, I'm not sure what it's like now. I have a University Degree which makes things easier. 




 Lots and lots of flying, the most fun was flying in a tiny twin-engine from Kathmandu, Nepal into Lukla, which is officially one of the most dangerous airports in the world as it is carved into the side of a mountain with a too-short runway, which the decided to fix by making it extremely steep so the planes just drop off the end! It felt a lot like the scene from Aliens when their spaceship is dropped onto the planet! Anyway...

I used lots of local transport, especially in Viet Nam and India, the worst journey being 40 hours from Kathmandu to Delhi on a local bus, an experience I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy! Other than that there was a couple of motorbikes (I fell of one going down a mountain in Nepal, still have the scars!) and a skateboard (fell of that one going down a volcano in New Zealand, still have several scars from that!!) 




 Varanasi, India was seriously freeky, I answered another question about that [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14dbv0/i_travelled_around_the_entire_world_solo_when_i/c7c1udp). I'm not sure about creepy, but I visited the S21 jail and killing fields in Cambodia which was extremely sobering and frankly deeply disturbing (do a google search, theres loads of info about Cambodia's Khmar Rouge history). 




 Tough one to answer! I broke a bone in my foot and was stuck in Wanaka, New Zealand for a few weeks on crutches and could not have been happier. So happy in fact I emigrated to New Zealand! If you haven't been to New Zealand, go for the good of your soul, especially South Island! Other than that, I spent some time deep in the Himalayas which was an incredible experience, and northern Viet nam, also an awesome place and awesome people!! 




 Varanasi, India. Insane place! It is the holiest city in hinduism as it is right on the Ganges and is said to be the ultimate place to die if you are a Hindu, so there is a hell of a lot of dead people about! Right on the river bank there are what are called 'Burning Ghats', which is were the bodies of the dead are cremated in the open air, as many as 200 a day per temple. However, bodies of children, cows or people with infectious decease, such as leprosy or malaria are not aloud to be burned, so are simply weighed down and dumped in the Ganges. Yet, it is also considered spiritually cleansing to bathe in the Ganges in Varanasi, so while you can have 20-30 bodies all burning away right on the river and the constant dumping of human and animal remains into the river, you have hundreds of people all along the river bathing. Insane. 




 I was raised in england (I now live in New Zealand) and the legal age to start employment is 16 in england. I applied for work the day after my 16th birthday and pretty much worked none stop up until just before I left, which was about a month after I turned 18. All in all the trip cost me about 7000 GBP for a nine month journey, but that was doing almost everything on the cheap. Totally worth it! 




 I am now 22 and about to do it again. The journey took nine months and was planned, financed and undertaken entirely by myself. If you are planned a bit of travel or backpacking I would be happy to offer my advice, especially if you are a young traveller or on a limited budget, or if you feel like doing something incredibly adventurous, heroic and foolhardy!

 I have a faint scar on my right elbow and shoulder I got from skateboarding down the side of a volcano in New Zealand, having never ridden a skateboard before and a clear scar up my right shin from falling off a motorbike driving down a mountain in Nepal, having never driven a motorbike before! I'm not sure, do I get epic or dumbass points for these? 




 its cool bro, I hate being wrong as well. Just to reiterate: This is men playing without pads http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIZQdf_zw3Y

Because we are not poofy americans, we tackle hard in NZ without pads, but have fun with your pillowfighting! 




 [I don't know who told you the tackles aren't as heavy in rugby, but they were talking shit.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5KkpW79o4w) And saying they are different so can't be compared...just what? I say rugby is less wimpy much as kittens are more wimpy than chainsaws. 




 Sorry I couldn't hear you through all that padding... 




 If I may be so brave: Rugby. 




 I sympathise with your point of view and you are of course right in much of what you say. There are christian-run soup kitchens and clinics and all variety of aid available, especially in the western world. However there are also all of these same things organised and put into motion by secular people and charities. Personally I find this form of rewardless altruism far more moving than a religious charity giving stance, but I digress. The unfortunate truth is the Catholic Church is a lot more picky about whom it grants aid to than any secular charity. Oxfam provide famine relief, support and aid to all manner of people in all manner of situations completely regardless of who or what they are, even entering war zones to do so. The same, regrettably, can not be said of the Church.

Disclaimer: Please don't look at this response as an attack on you or aggression of any sort, I am merely attempting to address and discuss your argument, and I respect your point of view.  




 you managed to fill all that space without actually saying anything. Impressive. 




 Not sure if sarcasm... 




 Please allow me to be the first to say you are an idiot and you're fooling no one. 




 I think you will find most atheists (yes, there are a lot of mindless plonkers on this site who just like to poke fun) can see there is some good done in the name of religion. However, we also see the amount of evil done in the name of religion. Being open-minded is about balanced and objectivity. Yes the church obviously gives a great deal of aid to the world, but they do a lot of harm, and have caused untold suffering. weigh up both sides, as many other people do, and come to your own conclusion. merely saying both sides look like idiots only shows your ignorance. I refer you to [this comment.](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/13rd6i/til_the_catholic_church_is_the_largest/c76phgr) 




 Lets break this down. First thing to notice is the word 'non-governmental'. Lets face it, there are very few non-governemental aid organisations, and since we grant the Catholic Church their own sovereign state (Vatican City), how can they be considered non-governmental? They simply can't, and I would be interested to see their percentage of wealth and capitol spend on aid compared to that of other countries or charities. I dare say it would not stack up quiet so well.

Second. All other charities in the world, save those dreaded few sponsored by religion, help those in need and in famine, they make no demands upon the suffering, they simply give aid. It is commonplace (I am not just ranting, I have seen this for myself) for christian charity to only be given to christian people, that is to say if you do not believe in Jesus and the christian doctrine (or the wickedness of condoms) you simply are not aloud aid. No other charity includes indoctrination as part of its charity, and this should not be considered anything but wicked. Also, lets just quickly look at where the catholic cash-bags come from. Before modern globalisation the Catholic Church was by far the most insidious imperialist nation in the world, and the cash flowed in from all corners of the impoverished world. Look at the damage done by Christianity in Africa. Other charity organisations take money from those who can afford to give and apply it to the poor. The Catholics look at the money they already took from the poor and think they aught to give some back.

Third, let us examine the inference of this claim. This is wikipedia, it does not make this statement true. I highly doubt it is compared to organisations such as Oxfam, who I have worked alongside.

EDIT: Instead of just downvoting me, why not offer a response? I will reasonably address any sensible response to this comment. 




 She was one of my ex-girlfriends best mates. Nice girl! 




 just thought I would say, I know her! 




 On the same note, I could circumcise myself with scissors if i wanted to. Just because something is possible, doesn't mean it is to be done! 




 You can see in this picture I think how uncomfortable Goering felt sitting next to Hess, whom he considered (probably accurately) to be insane. 




 Maybe the world doesn't need religion to be the basis for a government? Maybe? 




 Its called American Politics. That ain't democracy chaps!

 To get the ball rolling I will share possibly my best story: I once woke up in a graveyard about 2 miles from the place I had been getting drunk. Not entirely sure why I was there but I didn't feel all too healthy! 

I also got kicked out of the same Irish Bar twice in one night in Auckland, then found an ATM receipt for $150 in my pocket with no money and no clue where the money went!

 This is a topic I have given a great deal of thought to (as have many people, obviously) and have come to my own conclussions which I will atempt to elaborate fairly, so please no one mistake my for a fire and brimstone /r/athiesm-ist.

The idea of an afterlife, or of somehow in any respect surviving ones own death, is obviously a hugely thought over and discussed point, possibly the most in history. It seems to rely however on there being something in the body (some might call it 'soul' or 'spirit') that is somehow separate from the whole. When a human dies, the physical body decays, inevitably. Therefore, something must exist beyond physical realms. Furthermore, this spiritual something must carry and bare hallmarks of the individual it 'belongs to'. Forgive my cynicism, but such a thing, as far as all material evidence and cold logic is concerned, does not exist, furthermore most likely *cannot* exist in this physical world we inhabit. 

The idea of surviving ones own death is, to the best of my beliefs, the pinnacle of wishful thinking, as anyone can see. Obviously most people would sincerely wish to live past there death, or more so that loved ones might who have already died, and this leads us to hypothesise on ways that it may be possible, giving rise to various things that is a whole different discussion in itself.

Some may say this view is cynical or I must be a pretty miserable/depressed person to hold such a view. However I see this life, and my youth, as hugely significant and precious beyond words because I know it will never come again, I have one chance to live a full and worthy life, I better not waste it! I encourage at every opportunity anyone else to think on the issue along those lines. Obviously given the choice almost everyone would want to have an afterlife, but consider for a moment that one day you will breath your last, and that will be the end. Doesn't that fill you with the appreciation for the miracle that is the body you inhabit and how amazing and precious it is, to be alive.
