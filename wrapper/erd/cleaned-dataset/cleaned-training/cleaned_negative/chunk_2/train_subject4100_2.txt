 This is real. I'd love to give you some sort of proof, but any other picture I put up can easily be considered photoshopped if you already think this one is. I'd do more than that for you, but I have a final to worry about, so you'll have to wait if you're eager.

And yeah, I have a final I'm supposed to be pulling an all-nighter for right now, and the biggest thing I've accomplished so far is getting one of our facebook posts on the front page of reddit. I'll be successful one day.


One day. 




 It's a guy. To the left of the picture. 




 Yeah, this is referring to Plano, TX. There's definitely an abundance of those kids here. We tend to refer to Plano as a city in it's own little bubble.

I grew up here too. 














 I wouldn't normally say this, but considering there's 10 slots open, I'd love for *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2* to get at least a nod for a Best Picture nominee. 









 Sorry.

 Not exactly at the bottom. Bikini Bottom's somewhere in the middle of the sea. If you remember clearly, Rock Bottom was one of the dark cities in the sea where Spongebob couldn't bear to be.


...I just realized how badly I need to start studying for my exam. 




 You'd be surprised how often I see that joke annoy the hell out of girls. I wouldn't be taking this a bit seriously if I didn't see that happening. 




 I'm commenting this again here so people will hopefully see it:

To everyone pointing out the hypocrisy of men when they call out girls for stuff like this: I wrote a earlier here explaining how I hate diagrams like this because it's the exact way of thinking a guy can have towards a girl *and* the broad-mindedness a girl can have towards a guy. I deleted it because it was getting downvoted for whatever reason. I call out my guy friends everytime they make another borderline pathetic "make me a sandwich" joke, and I make damn sure I respect everyone I have the pleasure to meet; man or woman.

But in case guys haven't noticed this either: *we* are part of the problem as well. 




 I just lost my front page virginity.

 You can't expect a band to sing about masturbation and being bored for 15+ years. They're around 30-40 years old now. Their music will change as they do, along with any other band that actually grows up. 




 I don't know about you, but reading this random submission on Reddit just slapped me in the face to get back up and work on my goals. Reading those words from his dad gave me hope in fulfilling my goals to be as good of a father as I can be in the near future. 

Sometimes people could really benefit from reading something as simple as a letter like this. Don't feel urged to ignore that and accuse a person you don't know of something he probably didn't intend for in the first place. 




 Reading this reminded me of all the sacrifices my dad has made for me as I've grown up. I can't wait to get married and be the best father ever to my unborn son. There's nothing I want more in life than to give to him what my dad's given to me.

Thanks for sharing this. Your father sounded like he was one hell of a genuine guy. I'm going to start working towards my future now, which means getting back to studying for this exam tomorrow. 









 I have no questions. I just wanted to thank you for being one of my role models through my four years of high school. I never thought a sitcom  could hit me so close and stick with me throughout all these years. JD and Turk are pretty much the reason I can be proud to say I have a bromance myself today. 

Thanks for everything. You're a genius. All I wanted to say. 




 This might not mean much coming off the internet from a random redditor, but it's never too late if you try. If you want something, go get it. 




 Don't.

 I was on a parking garage when I heard the tornado sirens. Unfortunately, no tornadoes were around at all, but it felt wicked to be in the middle of a storm like that. I was pretty ecstatic about it.  My advice: go out there even if it's just a thunderstorm.

 Oh, wait. 




 How was it like looking at yourself almost exactly as you looked 25 years ago? It would be so surreal for me to see a moving, acting, younger version myself.

I read the AMA in your voice, by the way. 




 Edited. 




 They're still up there for me. Don't know what's going on. but in any case, I took screenshots beforehand. I figured they'd probably come in handy if we are able to take some sort of legal action.

 I'm trying to find a way to contact the person that made the page. I'll send them this link and see if they can keep screenshots of everything. Thanks! 









 I don't listen to you guys much, other than your Umbrella cover, but my brother has always been a huge fan. Just wanted to say thanks for coming out and doing this. It's always awesome to see someone from a big band come out and take the heat from people on the internet to answer questions for their fans. 

My question is, I'm aspiring to be an artist sometime in the future as well. Either through music or film. What advice would you give for someone who doesn't necessarily want the fame or the big life, but to at least be heard for what he does?

Thanks! 




 I may not listen to All Time Low, but my younger brother happens to be one of their biggest fans, and he's always been the one to pick up after the shit his friends do, and look after his friends because of the stupid stuff that they do. He's the one who makes sure our family stays sane in times of tension, and he's always been there for anyone he loves. My brother is 16 years old, and I can already see more balls in him than I can see in you, if I was even to be given an entire biography on your predictably sad life. I'm willing to bet on that. 

Don't bring your useless throwaway account into this community and attempt to be a Negative Nancy to people who have a taste in music that you don't like. Don't attack someone on a personal level because they're different from you and have not done a single thing to you in their life. People like you make me sick. 




 Sorry for the incredibly late response. Studying took me over the past two days. But hopefully you read this.

Okay, so these passages were the passages I knew people would ask about, and there is good reason to. If I read something like this, I'd surely feel threatened too. So why is it in the Qur'an? The defenders of the Qur'an will always tell you you have to look into the context, but that's an overly stated and under-explained argument, in my opinion. I'll try giving you the full reasoning.

The Qur'an was not released as a book back in it's time. The Prophet Muhammad was given, so we believe, these passages over a series of an Islamic lunar month (which you may know today as Ramadan). They were speeches given to him by an angel named Jibrail who made him memorize these passages. This was a time of war for him and his people. It wasn't a great time for them either. People didn't like that Muhammad was speaking of the idols they worshipped as false, and that he was asking them to see that there is one creator of the universe. It turned into the dark ages for them. Muhammad's many family members and friends were actually killed and tortured for the sake of angering him. These conflicts escalated, and during that time, people looked to him for guidance because he's been their leader this far. They trusted him. 

The passages you gave (2.191-93) was given as speeches to him to guide his people down the right path as they entered this war. And the thing is, these attackers could have murdered their families beforehand, yet this passage specifically ensured that the Muslims kill only when they're being attacked. If anyone surrendered at all, then show no hostility to them. This passage wasn't given as an order to kill any disbeliever anyone sees, but an order to fight with defense against an army in a time of crisis.

To make the best metaphor I can out of this, imagine your parent's parenting history put into a book. Should I have gone back and read that your mom said "I'm going to beat you", I'd be all 'WHOAA. CALL CHILDRENS AID. NOW.'

The exception is when I would have to go back and read the history of what was happening at that moment, when you probably did something to get her mad. The main thing the Quran has in common with what one learns from his parents is that they both have issues that deal with everything. There's violence, and peace, but all of them are told through interconnected stories to bring through one message: be a good person. 

As for believing in god or going to hell, I have my thoughts on it as well. We all interpret our religions our own way, and I think that these people would have had the proff right there for them. They've seen Muhammad cut a moon in half, and miracles that would be unbelievable. The disbelievers in the time of this scripture tended to be unkind people, and I think the Qur'an, as well as any other scripture, stated that if one has seen the truth, but chooses not to believe it, would await whatever judgement that god sets on him. In the end, I honestly think it comes down to be a good person, and to help humanity. The Quran gave passageways that explained not to ever forcefully place an ideology, even Islam, onto a person, and Muhammad carried this out by making Constitutions with monks and christian villages that established freedom of religion. But that's just my two cents on it.

I'll end this with another passage that can hopefully sum up howthe Quran is not a book of rules and guidelines on a list, but rather a series of stories from times of hardship and basic human problems and the morals we must overall learn from them, whether we believe in a God or not. 

  If anyone slew a person unless it be for murder or for spreading mischief in the land it would be as if he slew the whole humanity: and if anyone saved a life it would be as if he saved the life of the whole humanity.

This was one passageway that allowed me to choose this religion if I'm going to believe in a god. I like the fact that it's struggling for the better of humanity as a whole.

Let me know if i made anything unclear. Again, sorry for being so late!

 




 Wow man. You're a douchebag. 




 Your friend was trying to match it together to make it seem as if God really did just want us to decrypt the science out of the book. My view is basically the assumption you made of the Quran being a metaphorical book of signs. And by the way, please don't hesitate to ask me on any passage, nasty or not! I want to do the best I can at explaining those too. And thanks for being respectful while making criticism. :) 




 Which is why i read it first. I simply said translation to clarify that I read it in Arabic. Sorry for the misunderstanding. :\ 




 I do think that is a valid assertion, like the many subreddits we have here, people see things in their own ways, and people fit text with meanings to see something in their way. I've done this myself.

To make it clear, nothing ever convinced me that God (or Allah) is real. I am not at a point where I know for sure that there is a god. I was faced with a simple question: whether there is a God or not. From everything I've known and experienced, I chose to *believe*. Choosing Islam was a second step. Basically, it supported what I *wanted*: belief in a divine creator, and the fact that religion and science can come together. I gave it the most recognition. It made sense to me. This won't be the case with everyone. 




 I think I spoke in the wrong way. I was trying to state that it was brought up in a metaphorical way. Agreeing with what you said.

I think in order for humans to understand something so great, metaphorical poetry was necessary. It's a way to connect. The Quran is not a book of science, but a book of understanding the picture. Science is the anatomy which we have been told to study. 




 I like this. 




 I don't think you understood the part where I said during my agnostic phase, I was studying everywhere about this. Agnosticism = knowledge. I get it. AMA still relevant. 

And sorry, but r/atheism isn't some secret club where you need to present yourself in a certain way to be 'accepted' by the community. People come, people talk, regardless of belief, if it's on the topic of atheism. I came here to hopefully give people a better idea of what a religious guy can be like. I'm not an asshole. I came to talk like one would at a bar. Thanks.
