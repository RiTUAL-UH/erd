 Hi, reddit! Inviting everyone to take a look at this paperwork-slaying app for travelers. Input the info about your destination and the general purpose of your visit and get a full, up-to-date detailed list of documents you need to have sorted out before you go + all the special requirements. A good opportunity to save yourself some time on research.

I took part in creating this app and would appreciate feedback, both as a developer and as a baby traveler gearing up for the first abroad tour.

 Same. I'll start using cases the day I have to face any negative consequences of not using one. So far so good. 




 I've heard lots of people complain about it and ask to switch places in buses, trains and other vehicles that have several sets of seats facing various directions. 





























 Because I'm pining for takoyaki again. 














 My team has finished a new game - it's a mix between racing game and driving simulator, depending on the game mode you choose. Full-featured version available for free. Feedback is highly appreciated, especially on graphics and animation - we did our best to polish them.
