 Senior animal trainer Mike Alexander and a team of four experts spent a total of 19 weeks preparing the critters for their film debut. Once the animals became accustomed to sitting with the trainers (each squirrel was trained one-on-one), they were taught to pick up a nut and place it in a metal bowl. The bowl was eventually replaced by a conveyor belt for the film.

 Maybe he was a perfectionist, or maybe he wanted to cut costs . The one guy who played the dwarf was paid 1 million dollars (thats right). Which may or may not be cheaper than hiring 100 of actors and applying make up on them. 




 Well, in an era when Star Trek and Star Wars were pretty famous ... im pretty sure people would have watched this too and grow a liking 









 It's a live action movie adapted from manga. 




 I think Two Faces Of January is one of his best films. It also has a great performance from Oscar Isaac.

 You know its a great game when people talk about it even 3 years later 









 The Question mark is confusing me . 














 Works just fine :D 









 *while playing LoL* 




 AND SOME OTHER THINGS. 




 **THIS.** 




 Zero hope is bit of an overstatement. Look at Nic Cage for example. Although having a shitty year, he has given a great performance in Joe ... which is a good movie IMO. 



















 L.A Confidential . 









 That's the third part . I have only watched the first and second. They were pretty good IMO .

 You really want to play Bronson , don't ya ??

 Am i the only one who liked Two Faces Of January or is it really that bad ??

Probably would land a #12 or #13 spot IMO. 




 So , remake of Man on Wire ?? 




 YES !! 









 Let's be optimistic. 




 Why wouldn't he ??

 Ricky "Ticky" Bobby 




 *Puns* 




 OP has relevant username. 




 This seems like a reasonable explanation. 




 Quality is what matters more than anything . TWD seems to be going downhill on quality everyday IMO. 




 annoying and unnecessary (i mean the mid season breaks) 




 What do you guys think about these current tv shows making a habit of running mid season finales ?? Shows like "The Walking Dead" and "The Flash" seem to follow this. 









 Gotta agree with you.
 









 Does real life run on 15 fps ??

 Try harder pls. 




 *Extreme Gaming*... Surely lives up to it's name.

 Skyfall nearly edges Casino Royale as the better movie. 




 It's a pretty bad poster but ,  it's got Samuel.L.Jackson and Colin Firth so it might be a pretty good popcorn flick. 




 This comment would either get down-voted to oblivion in other threads or either stand glorious like you.

 I think it is one of the best and most ambitious sci-fi movie of it's time.I loved the movie.The ending was perfect.It was more like a ending after the ending,which i liked.

If contact would have been made now ... it would have been a smash hit.
