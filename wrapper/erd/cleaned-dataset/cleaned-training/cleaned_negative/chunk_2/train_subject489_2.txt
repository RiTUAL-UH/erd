 looks like a healthy relationship 




 what advice did it give you? 




 you should probably add what youre talking about 




 well if it helps  




 am i the only one who could always avoid this kind of situations? 




 someone's jelly over here 




 so awkward 




 So this was just random? 




 Sorry english is not my first language..

I just wanted to say that they are showing how the iPhone has the feature which samsung was advertising strongly on their S5 and apple is just showing that it is also possible with the iPhone without even mentioning it directly.. Its not an attack (couldnt find another word) they're just making fun of them 




 It's just a small thing I noticed, but I think you guys might like it. In the new iPhone 5s "Powerful" commercial you can see how some guy is using his iPhone to measure his pulse with just the flashlight and the camera (there are tons of apps for this) which is clearly a little attack towards Samsungs new Heartbeat Monitor

 yay we are as good as the us 




 yeah but why cant i just watch them in my photos app?  




 can't save/show gifs..  




 They have 3 Million iPhone 5c left.. 




 So what youre saying is "i can't tell what i want, but others also can't"? 




 As I said, those things have been proven wrong, thats not just my opinion (Look here: http://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/ttugs/i_was_in_the_library_the_other_day_and_i/c4psdtb)

It is also surprisingly that all of the people asking about the goal of feminism are feminists. (The posts linked to in the sidebar) so most of you guys dont even know what you are fighting for? 




 Most of those discussions are leading to one single post, which is proven wrong by different people in the same threads.
 




 So, I'm just wondering .. what would you feminists consider a perfectly fine social world? When is your "movement" done? What is the ideal situation to live in? I'm just curious about your mission and whether you have a goal.  




 thats not making any sense at all 




 LeBlanc shits on him
