 Are the mega evolutions likely to be final smashes? 




 Do the 3ds pictures just look like this because it is supposed to be "3d" or will they actually have a different appearance than the wii u game?

 Can I reserve Static? 




 Any other set is good!

 I'll be on tomorrow if that's better?

 Okay! I'll add you and you can come now! And apple is the best neighbor! She was in my town since release day  




 I can have her in boxes whenever it's a good time. 




 Could I have two of each type?  




 How many hybrids can I have? 




 Do you have any of these pictures? Gwen, Savannah, Antonio, Simon, Rooney, Limberg, Anabelle, Flo 




 I have apple moving soon. What items and hybrids do you have? 




 Oh nevermind. Lol 




 Wait, was there something to cram for? 




 If a villager moves out of my town, and I get a different version of the same villager from another town to move in, will they act like they remember me? 




 Okay, I'll be right over! 




 I'll take her if you get no response! 




  town* in the first line 




 So I pretty much played out my tone a few months ago and got bored, and I'm thinking of restarting my town. I want to get back into the game. However, I put a lot of work into this town and love all my villagers. Should I restart?
