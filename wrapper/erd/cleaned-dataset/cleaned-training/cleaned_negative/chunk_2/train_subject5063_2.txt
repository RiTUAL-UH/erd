 Holy shit that's disturbing.  




 Voiced by Stephen Colbert.  




 But can I do it in 5 days?  




 Fuck cords. Bluetooth is where it's at.  




 What's even more disgusting is that you know that the lender shaved his pubes with it too and now they're pube buddies.  









 Actually 13 grams of fiber plus 6 grams of Erythritol (what I assume is a sugar alcohol) So 25-19=6 grams of carbs per bar. 1 being sugar.  



















 Thanks! 10 years experience running quality title and now I'm going to have to look outside of the industry I love until things start moving again.  




 I add 2 Tbsp of hazelnut fiber creamer.

 Texas: I know lots of people who have gotten the axe from different projects lately.  




 Octopus be all like

 Ill have those niggers voting Democratic for the next 200years.Lyndon B. Johnson to two governors on Air Force One -


TheseNegroes, theyre getting pretty uppity these days and thats a problem for us since theyve got something now they never had before, the political pull to back up their uppityness. Now weve got to do something about this, weve got to give them a little something, just enough to quiet them down, not enough to make a difference.LBJ

 We like to gaze into the window of your soul and see all of the disappointment of your childhood that will someday come to bear on us. It's like reading the future.

 I didn't know there was an epidemic of people getting killed because someone was holding a phone to their ear.  




 It's normally kept underground in a hermetically sealed vault until the time after the apocalypse when the chosen shall be guided to it so they can discover its secrets and repopulate and rule the Earth and bring tyranny to weak men.  




 I thought it was during the exorcism of Jonah Hill.  




 Yes, everybody has heard those things.  




 That is all, Dicknoses.  




 That's why we have some in reserves. It's like what welfare was originally intended for.  




 I tried to book Hotmail for a bachelorette party.  



















 Getting real tired of Piggy's bullshit, I am.  




 Get it? French mime? Je-sius, people.  




 Oppenmeimer.  




 Quest bars have 25 grams of carbs per bar.  




 Nice to know there are still people out there that are as enlightened and pure as the driven snow as you are.  




 I think it's a great idea! I'd meet up with you!  




 Please write a book for the rest of us who have no idea what we're doing in life! Take it as far as you can!  




 And I'm not saying I'm not either and I'll bet you have a little racism in you too. The woman who attacked him was a filthy animal not because of her race but because of her actions.  




 No. He thinks that the woman who viciously attacked him on the street was sub-human scum. And she is!  




 Where? Are they hiring?  




 Horrific! I'm going to ask my doctor for that pill tomorrow.  




 Any particular reason? Are sugar alcohols bad? Regular protein bars taste like crap. 




 Are [these](http://www.atkins.com/products) acceptable to eat as treats when I get sugar cravings and am cutting while still working out?  It seems like they provide lots of protein while only having net 3 grams or so of carbs.  Has anyone had any experience with these or sworn off them for any reason?  Would you highly recommend against them? 



















 So he has to estimate his own earnings?  That sucks.  




 One that has enough money to be able to pay a kid to lick her clit. A young one doesn't have either the disposable income or willingness to pay someone.  




 Mmmm...  That 95 year-old clit.  




 I've heard lots of arguments, pro and con, and it seems like people sometimes advocate this out of spite that someone else got their money unjustly. I want to know the actual hows and whys of putting actual money in my pocket enabling me, as a middle class person, to get richer.  




 Huh, interesting. I'm not sure that the mirror image thing is necessary but the heads up thing is cool. I've learned to listen to TV more than watch. You just have to have a familiarity with the general settings and characters.  




 They're dumb and they make bad life decisions. Source: was one.  




 Per time honored tradition: no one gives a fuck about your opinion of Texas. Or mine.  




 He should've had two drinks.  




 Sell me one of your melons!  




 I watch (well, listen to) Netflix in my car as I'm driving so suck it cops!  Come and get me!  




 Then I guess you chose "leave it".  




 And then you just sit there in your own filth wiping your diseased, sticky hands all over the seat for the next person to discover the choco-doodoo apocalypse you created for their date slacks?  OK.  




 Gold. I can't get enough gold.  




 It was a reaction to the shitshow aftermath of Haight Ashbury.  




 I think you might have missed the fan in the pic. Understandable.  




 Life experience is a bitch.  




 Yeah. Never had an issue with sensitivity here as an uncircumcised man.  




 It's also uncomfortable for me to have an exposed scab I picked off rubbing against clothing.  




 Huh. Dear diary, today I learnt...  




 I don't have to use lube unless I want to and it feels awesome! Having to go wet everytime would suck.  




 So no masturbating with a soft cloth?  Fuck that.  




 How do you know it's enhanced if you've never experienced being circumcised?  You're just going off someone else's word. Also, my circumcised dick doesn't get cold so that's not an issue.  




 We have a QA tester here.  




 Her tits are starting into my soul.  




 Well, I can 100% say that I just read the most fucked story I will read this millenia. 

I came here because I saw a beautiful boat and stayed for the mind rape.  




 Give it 2 years.  




 Everyone I know on different projects is looking. It's 1986 all over again. Muricans are about to find out how much of their fake- ass $18 trillion economy was propped up by fracking.  




 I hope so.  Hope they're suffering as much as I am. 




 I think I just stepped up my... arts and culture... game.

 Why April Fool's Day? 




 What do you do with it? 









 Reminds me of how Brits passive aggressively speak up about someone cutting in the queue in front of them.  




 You... You can just do that?  




 Are you English?  




 For what it's worth, I don't think you deserved to be on the worst dressed list.  




 You know you can block that shit.

If you really want to...  




 The only way I can do them now!  









 I have no problem with bench because it involves pushing straight out without bending at the wrist. Bent wrist push-ups are another story.  




 Exactly. No more bending at the wrist and applying pressure but you can push out straight like a bench press easily. Guess that would mean handstands on your fists?  




 I was really excited until I remembered that I have the same thing. Can barely do a real pushup anymore...  









 Skinny pajama jeans.  




 Yes!  We just ask that you wash it and keep abreast of any foul smells.  




 Was hoping this was a picture of Harrison Ford riding a bicycle.

 This conversation was private!!

 Sorry... about privates.  




 HA! Gotta have priorities!  




 LOL!  I have to put a lotion on my balls that turns into a powder so they won't stick to my leg during the summer. No wonder we hide our parts.  




 LOL! Sub $90! #Just1986Things  




 Ayyyy  me too! But they're still fucking weird.  




 Then you are one of the lucky ones.  




 When you get home squat over a mirror and tell me what alien life form you keep in that crotch.  




 He wants to remind you not to let your butthole run cold and that he's here to help warm it up.  




 Not so goofy now, are they?  




 Here's a secret you can tell your gal pals: They're never flaccid until they hit the air.  




 Obviously jacking off on the back of the unsuspecting guy in front of him!  




 Obama did what on Reddit?  




 M'usty  




 Seems like the Dems didn't have much motivating them to get off their ass and support their Congress person. A ton of non-votes to gridlock Obamas policies.

 Oh hai, Satan!  




 2010 and 2014 never happened! 2010 and 2014 never happened!  




 2010 and 2014 never happened! 2010 and 2014 never happened!  




 Well, at least now you have a gym nickname!  




 I once shit myself in school because I went so hard in my reading circle!  




 Gorilla warfare!  




 Compromise these days is when Republicans agree to do things the Democrat way. Never mind the 2010 and 2014 elections when Democrats were wasted in landslides across the nation in every kind of office.  




 RIP in peace 2010 and 2014. 




 I would say because most people don't watch Sesame Street.  




 People on a channel you don't like can't be funny! 




 Why? They're awesome.  




 What makes that particular user base so special?  




 Selma.  




 Then this 40 year-old 12 year-old will take one please.  




 We in the US have A George Lopez we'd like to get disappeared.
