 Oh ok. Well I haven't tried it yet, but it seems the last 3 are kind of hard. And if you have been programming for less than a year, I wouldn't feel bad. The author of the article is a little pretentious. 

If it is difficult for you, then  that's means it is a great example for you to work through. I'm sure people here would be happy to help! If you figure it out you will feel great and will learn in the process 




 You mean it was too easy? 




 LPT if you can't do this now, create a quick repo with a readme.md that contains the 5 problems. I already made a repository so I can come back to these problems later, and the questions are in my readme file.

 Welcome to Reddit, newbie :) 




  These are two different things.

That's my point... you lumped it together. And

 Long story short, I've been writing "apps" since a decade before they were called "apps" and long before you had pubic hair

And another way you make yourself look like a d-bag by rubber stamping your authority. It sounds like you are over-compensating for something. Someone with 15 years experience doesn't tell you they have 15 years of experience unless:

* Their experience came into question
* They are lying
* They are insecure and worried no one will take them seriously

It can't be the first option, because you mentioned your experience before we even began talking. You entered a conversation and jumped in with an irrelevant opinion, and bragging of your experience. You reek with artificial superiority.

But please tell me how you were doing X while I was doing something only a child does. That really makes you appear mature and above childish arguments. 




 Who the hell refers to iOS apps as 'web apps'? Web app implies an app through a browser. So anything that gets information from the web is a 'web app'? Well that's new! (sarcasm)

 Edit: They are called fucking Fig Newtons, I'm reading it off the box you idiot.

wtf?

And I like how you bragged and gloated "I'm the shit and know more than you (even though I didn't even ask what you know) and I've been doing this for 15 years" - when your rant wasn't even relevant, neither was your AMAZING experience in 'app' development. Like who gives a crap? We are talking about naming conventions of the OS versions. If you didn't come off like a pompous douchebag, I probably wouldn't have said anything. 

At least I don't claim to know everything. I simply attacked your statements. At no point did I say, "I know more than you" or did I say I have "x years of experience and I am and expert in the field". You put yourself on a pedestal, so I tried to knock you on your pretentious ass. Maybe if you were more clear wtf you meant the first time around (and weren't a complete tool), then we wouldn't be here right now. 




 Opinion? Can you please tell me what web apps are coded in Objective C or Swift? Most web apps aren't even written nowadays in Java anyway (even though you could).

Either way you were complaining about *Android*, which has nothing to do with web apps or web sites. 

I Googled nothing. And again, your rant is irrelevant and seems to show your ignorance and blatant Android hating based on nothing. 

Have you ever even written an Android app? Sounds like you have not, which makes your rant really stupid. I say you have not written an Android app because you said:

 I've written websites and web apps for 15 years

As if that somehow makes you qualified to give an opinion on coding Android or iOS.

And: WHO GIVES A CRAP?? 




 Yes I guess this is more of a "TIL something I should have known 3 years ago" 




 Dude no one gives a crap about your rant here... go complain on /r/shittyprogramming or something. 

 TL;DR ~ I've coded both. I've written websites and web apps for 15 years. I've written apps since before you even knew the word was associated with something other than that small meal you eat before your actual meal.

Um who was talking about 'both'? And what do websites and web apps have to do with Android and iOS (and who was talking about iOS anyway?)

Last I checked Android is written in Java, iOS in Obj-C/Swift - web apps are written in CSS/HTML/Javascript/PHP/C#/etc. So either you are full of crap or too lazy to actually say what you mean. 




 right 









 That's hilarious. So much so that I almost gilded you. 




  instead of just rolling over for public unions.

Except that's what they've done for decades, and that's why we are where we are. 




 For those who defend Chicago Teacher's salaries with the 'cost of living' - New York City teachers get paid about the same (slightly less actually) than Chicago teachers. **However, the cost of living in NYC is 50% higher than in Chicago**.

I'm calling BS on this 'cost of living' justification nonsense. 




  The cost of living is also above the national average. Relatively decent pay also prevents people from going to improved settings.

Not compared to other major cities where teachers make *less* money than Chicago, and their cost of living is *higher*. Chicago teachers have it **very well**, even the more so when accounting for cost of living. 

Example - cost of living is much higher in New York - yet they make less than Chicago teachers. In fact, if you account for living expenses, it makes Chicago salaries almost 50% higher than New York. 




 Because its not the CTA 




 I DECLARE SHENANIGANS 




 I agree 




 The article says the same thing - which means it's not giving us proper information. You cannot survive without water for 5 days. Period. So something is missing. I read the article and learned nothing new. My point stands. 




 Um you can't survive 5 days without water... 




 [Anyone can learn to code](http://www.Anyonecanlearntocode.com)

I don't know too much about it, but the one person I know seems to have done pretty well. He wasn't job ready, but he was ready for an internship when he was finished. Also while he was working at the internship, he helped out at the boot camp. 




 Ok but I don't think this forum is for people who care about the financial state of Apple. Not a very interesting answer - although possibly true. 




 I messaged my friend (who had the internship and now a job). I don't know the name. Will get back to you. 




 Why? That wouldn't make for a better product. Who cares which manufacture the chips come from? 




 Tell you I'm pro-life, anti same-sex marriage, and of course, a Republican 




  Would you mind pointing out testimonials of people who went from zero to employed in 60 days? I can't wrap my mind around that, so I'd appreciate some narratives to guide me through that.

No no, 60 days is nuts. I have a friend I personally know who went to a bootcamp that took somewhere between 4-6 months. He then got an internship, and then got a job. It was a Ruby/rails bootcamp in Chicago. I'm trying to get the name of it. Will report back. 









 3 months even for 1 language is completely unrealistic. HTML/CSS/Javascript in 3 months? Possibly. Maybe. But doubtful. The boot camp that I know of is longer than three months, and seems to have good job placement. It's small and has a lot of individual attention.  




  And some bootcamps are worth 10x more than my CS degree

Well there are two years of garbage (humanities english history math you probably will never use, even in CS..). The other two years is a lot of concepts, and coding that you end up having to teach yourself anyway. 

My statement was a bit of an exaggeration, especially if we are talking about a 3 month program. 




 Why does everyone love Uub so much?  




 Except that long hair is not genetic... you either choose to cut your hair, or choose not to... 




 I always see a lot of anti-bootcampers here. I think we need to make sure we make that distinction that *some* bootcamps are complete garbage. And *some* bootcamps are worth 10x more than my CS degree. 

It's really not that complicated. Research your bootcamp before signing up. There are some really bad ones, and some really good ones. 

No need to argue here.

 Haha I know, but the first link I found about sec was [this one](http://askubuntu.com/questions/20414/find-and-replace-text-within-a-file-using-commands) 




 **Below is what I wanted to post, but decided not to:**

This seems really simple, and I feel like I'm going to be embarrassed when I find out how to do this:

I want to take a file, to a find/replace using sed - however I don't want to make changes to the existing file - I want to keep the original file, but create a new file (or overwrite an existing file).

This is an example I found, but it does it in place:

    sed -i 's/original/new/g' file.txt

However in this case, file.txt has now been changed. I want to keep file.txt as-is, and create a new file `newFile.txt` instead.

Help?

That was what I typed out for my original post. After re-reading the Posting Guidelines, I decided I had not tried hard enough to figure out the answer on my own. 

Well guess what? Two minutes later I found exactly what I needed. 

Lesson: Sometimes you need to try a little harder before posting and asking for help.

 Thanks for the input, will take your advice. I'll fix up the site tonight. last question - in my html for the image reference, should I use the URL, or the local file location? I noticed you used url, but that is only because you wanted to show what it looked like. 




  img{
     width: 100%;
     max-width: 900px; /*or whatever number you fancy*/
 }

So that makes it look better in the browser, but now on my phone it seems to default to 900px (which is wider than the phone). 

Why does that happen? 




 So on the phone I want it to expand to the edges, but on desktop, if it expands to the edges its simply too large. 

I guess ideally I would want the picture to expand to a max number of pixels, which I think someone else has made that suggestion. 

EDIT: I like how you restructured the CSS. Thanks!
I am actually changing the picture to a different Rabbi, which has a ratio that is taller, and not wider.

EDIT: Although why the specific sizes for the text? Why not just use h1, h2, h3 etc?  




 Yea I know about bootstrap, but I haven't gotten into it yet. I will learn it at some point, but for now I want to know how to do this with just CSS. I shouldn't need a framework to accomplish such a simple task. 




 As long as Nestle keeps making my Nespresso, I'm good. 




 [Here](http://www.askyourlor.com) is a simple website that I am working on. I want it to display some text, and then a picture. The problem I am having is that it either looks great on mobile or desktop: but not both.

I'm using the 

     meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"

line to help with mobile (although I don't completely understand what it does). However the following code seems to make the picture too large on desktop:

        img {
            max-width: 100%;
        }

If I change the max-width to 60%, then it looks great on desktop, but the pic is then too small on mobile (it doesn't go all the way to the edges). 

Any help out there?
EDIT: Any other suggestions on my website are completely welcomed. And don't ask about the content.  




 Best comment so far 




 Ah I see. Well Saturday is impossible for me. WOuld I be able to come on Thursday and print out the tickets? 




 Lol so I gotta fly to Vegas in order to sell these tickets? 




 So what information are you adding here? That is a cancellation policy in case you don't pick it up. That's not what really what we are interested in. 




 It says this about Free Transfer Ticket -

 Why is there no Transfer button on my event in My Account?
Could be one of these:

 The venue doesn't offer Ticket Transfer yet (we're working on that)
The artist or venue turned Ticket Transfer off for that event/section

So it's possible that you can't. Will you be able to return the ticket? That's what I'm wondering. Their policy says up to 7 days, but this event could be excluded.

I have an Amex Business Plat card, and they can protect returns up to a certain amount (not sure how much).

EDIT: Amex will only cover up to $300. 




 What is the current rate of warming? 




 I thought the "Big 4" was Federer, Nadal, Djokovic, and Murray. 




 Powerball odds are around 1 in 170 million. I would probably say there won't be more than 10 million people trying to get the ticket at exactly 3 pm (and that is probably a gross overestimation). There are 500 tickets. So odds are 500 in 10,000,000, or 5 in 100,000, or really, 1 in 20,000. 

1 in 20,000 is significantly better than 1 in 170,000,000. 

So your odds of getting one of these tickets is 8500 times greater than winning the Powerball. 




 Interesting so that leaves Ticketmaster out. I wonder if that is for all tickets, or for TicketMaster only? 




 those 8000 are probably all promised to people already. Someone else noted that maybe you can't resell. Is that true? 




 what are you quoting? 




 So tickets go on sale at 3pm ET. Three places to get them:

* Ticketmaster.com
* Mgmgrand.com/mayweather
* Calling 800-745-300 (only 9 digits?)

So I guess the questions would be:

* Way to have the best odds of getting a ticket (there are only 500)
* Which ticket will have the *lowest* demand?
* Which ticket will give you the best return (total return, not percentage)

Since there are only 500 tickets going on sale, it will be almost impossible to get them, even if you go to the website at exactly 3pm. 

My theory - call 1 minute early to the phone number, and visit both websites at exactly 3. There is a chance those website won't be able to hand the load, and only those on the phone will get the tickets.

Is it even worth trying?

 You failed because you proposed a solution without even knowing what the data is. 




 Ok maybe, but def not what we have in mind - 1000 people walking around with headphones looking at art.  




 I should have specified - we want to *do* something - Art Institute is just walking around. I was thinking something sport or fun - not cultural. 




 It's a jpg for crying out loud. 




 I definately got a bit lucky. I got an internship for the team I currently work for, because I family friend of mine got me the interview (but not the job). After the summer they offered me a position for $75k. I'm not sure if my family friend had something to do with the salary, as it's corporate, and it's not like he can just throw money at me.

Anyway I have friends straight out of college who went to Seattle and got $100k, so $60-$70k sounds reasonable. Have you tried looking at Motorolla in the burbs? Boeing? CME? I don't know if the BA degree would hold you back after 5 years, but probably did when you first got a job.

As for helping you out, I only know of a position for a serious Oracle DB expert.  




 I work for a company with around 1000 people and we are looking for a venue for a summer party. We want a place where we can do something (not just hang around) outside - and somewhere we can go inside if the weather is bad.

Does such a place exist? We are located in the loop. 




 I am learning webdev on the side from my full time Java job - is photoshop really something you need to know? I am lost in the /s. 




 Ok I was thinking this was a redemption when buying tickets with miles - like the transferring to United and then buying a ticket with miles. I see that this is a bit different, and probably still not useful. 









 Had to zoom to 400% to read the article. That alone makes this a /r/shittyprogramming candidate 




 Just for some more data about Chicago -
I am a bit overpaid, but I make $75k (in the city) out of college only 4 months ago (I am also older, not sure if that changes anything).

I know that Motorolla (suburbs) pays at around $60k for some interns. HERE pays $50k for interns.

Just some numbers to think about. 




 at least this is the most upvoted comment 




  it's about the prisons wringing every last drop of money out of these guys

Um last I checked we *lose* money for keeping men in jail...

I stopped reading right there. 




 I had to add 'text-align: left' to the 'inner' class. The bullets were lined up, but the text was centered - so some of the text started next to the bullet, and some lines the text started far away (since there was little text to display, and it was centered).

I've just been googling everything I need to learn for CSS, but maybe some structured and detailed tutorials is what I need. Thanks for the help!

PS - didn't use codepen before - very helpful.

EDIT: my first codepen post- here is a demo of what change I had to make to your suggestion:

 Great answer! I tried the Flexbox version and it worked exactly how I wanted. Will try without Flexbox and report back. 




 Screw IE. 




 What is wrong with the design of the site? So hard to follow. I just wanted a simple top 10 list with names. Instead we go fancy yet annoyingly impossible to read graphs.  




 Elixir? 




 Holy cow flexbox is easy. Is flexbox not compatible with a lot of browsers? why not use it? 




 Jesus CSS is a pain in the ass. I'm learning it now. All I want to do is have a list of text (ul list), that is centered - but left aligned. So either I get bullets all the way on the left side of the screen, or bullets in the center, but completely scattered (they are not aligned vertically).

Cannot get this to work for the life of me. 









 I think I can guarantee the line number, or at least I can guarantee what the line will begin with (connection ... etc).

Yea I'm just wondering what too I can use. I have sed but not awk on Cmder. I have never used sec, but maybe that will work.  




 I like how OP specified that this is homework (not sarcasm). 




 Hi all!

I was wondering what is the best way to do the following (on Windows)

I have 4 .twb files (Tableau workbook - basically xml). Sometimes I will make changes to one workbook, and I want to copy the changes over the the other 3. The only difference between the workbooks is that they have different connection information. So really there is only a one line difference.

    connection authentication = myAuth schema='mySchema'

and so on. This line is different in each file, but everything else is the same.

How would I go about propagating all the changes from the first xml file to all four files - taking into account that the one particular line should not change for each file? 

Familiar with Java, so is there a simple library that can do this? Or maybe there is some script (scripting in windows?) I can write? I have Cmder, so maybe there is some utility for that I could use. Just need some direction. 




  Unfortunately I'd rather have the world be completely fucked climate wise in 100 years when I am dead than to have to live in a caliphate when I am old.

Both of those scenarios are hypothetical. 




 Would you say that is more of a stylistic thing, or there is a good reason for that? I agree with you that exceptions should be exceptions- but practically speaking I don't see why not use a try/catch for index out of bounds. 




 I'm calling bullshit on that one. 




 Because Europe is proving to have sustained a viable economic model? Greece? Spain? France? Even Denmark is showing signs that it's economic is not viable long-term. Not to mention comparisons to countries that are 1/60th of USA is not really a valid comparison. 

And you should read up on Sweden. They aren't doing so hot. 




 Regardless of their attitude, the 1%, **on average**, pay a higher effective tax rate (even when you include state, payroll, medicare etc) than the poor, the middle, and even upper middle class.
