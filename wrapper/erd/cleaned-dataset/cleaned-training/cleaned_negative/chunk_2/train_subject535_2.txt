 My Xbox one is no longer sending a single to my Sound bar over the digital optical cable, I'm wondering if anyone else has had this sort of problem and is there a solution? 
  
I've already tried replacing the optical cable and I confirmed the speaker works with my X360.

I don't have access to many articles on Wiley Online Library, and this unfortunately is one of them.  
  
If anyone could help me out it would be greatly appreciated.  


















































































































 I've recently acquired a decent suede leather jacket, and I'm wondering if anyone has any advice/experience in taking care and maintaining the jacket.
