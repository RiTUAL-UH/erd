 i know it's sad.   




 Agree.  Enters 8 non-major events and wins 5.  Competitive in Masters and British but still  gets no credit.  He will get number 15 but then it will be what about number 16.

 I've had a back spasm. It's unbelievably painful.  You just fall to the ground and hope it ends soon.  




 Unfortunately I do not.   




 I have that same putter. Love it! 




 All heroes die after Trinity event. We all knew it but why do they need to promo the ending? 




 agreed.  He's exactly right. 




 Congratulations. I've done it a couple times  and I might as well have beaten Tiger Woods. I felt so proud.  




 Funny and accurate 




 Thanks! 




 She reminds me of Jem from the 1980s

 Apologize.  I actually looked to see if it was posted didn't see it. I will delete it. Thanks for heads up.  




 I apologize if I pushed the rules.  Just letting everyone know it released today and that unlike previous game it does have in-app purchases PopCap is calling "micro-transactions."  Thanks for letting me know.  Have a good rest of the day.  PS.  I love the game and so do my children. 




 It comes out today and it has numerous in app purchase opportunities unlike the original game.  I can editorialize about anything I choose whether you agree or not.

 I found it entertaining  




 I read Justice League, Phantom Stranger, Justice League Dark and Pandora book.  Since the Trinity War started, the two main books are Justice League and Justice League Dark.   




 100% agree.   wins, two top 10 finishes in majors.  year isn't even over yet but Tiger's lost it.  Imbeciles.   




 Cartman's going to be pissed 




 Amen!   




 I had that book as a kid.  Bet my it's still at my parents house.   




 Thanks! 




 That's amazing to look at the amount money that golf generates today compared to 59 years ago.  Jack to only make that amount of money is insane.  




 You're welcome. They look tough! 




 That's damn funny 




 Chris Berman and golf don't mix.  actually, Chris Berman and anything don't mix 




 These are fantastic.  Thank you!   




 I'm a DC guy so don't know much other than the original movie.  Agree this Loki better than the original (sorry couldn't resist) 




 My 7 year old sons favorite movie.  




 i do as well.  Apparently, winning 5 tournaments thus far in 2013 is not enough.   




 agree with you 




 This was by far the best Flash Point series 




 Underwhelming but fitting is a perfect description.  




 Got 3 boys 7,9   12. They all play and love it. Best dad bonding on experience. 




 People who shouldn't play the game.  




 That's nasty 




 How'd you hit it? 




 My apologies 




 They're as bad if not worse than the NCAA 




 Takes a set of balls to do that 




 What a deal 




 And write bad movies. Who would have thought? 




 Agreed 




 The mask part 3 




 New 52 




 Scariest thing I've ever seen 




 i will take a lifetime supply please 




 funny 




 i want one.  i want one .  i want one 




 OR THE POST CAN PROVIDE THOSE THAT WOULD HAVE NOT OTHERWISE KNOWN THAT IGN WAS COUNTING DOWN THE TOP 25 WII GAMES OF 2010 THE OPPORTUNITY TO NOW FOLLOW THE COUNTDOWN. 




 sorry, I was under the assumption it was all 25 games.  my fault.   




 read slow and read carefully.  it's a wild ride that i am still not sure if I liked or disliked.   




 Sad so very sad 




 Go fuck yourself you lazy piece of shit.  




 I loved the whole run of ex machina.  social and political commentary is well done regardless of your political or social persuasion. 




 Tiger Woods would be proud! 




 beautiful!!!  Lucky Kids! 




 the official r/comicbooks is a good list to start but I would also recommend Judd Winick's "Barry Ween," Bill Willingham's "Fables," Green Lantern saga by Geoff Johns starting with "Green Lantern Re-Birth," Brian K. Vaughn's "Ex-Machina," Grant Morrison's "All Star Superman," Brad Metzler's "Identity Crisis."

I could do this all day so let me know if you need more suggestions. Y-the Last Man by Brian K Vaughn is a great comic book to begin with because it is captivating from page one.
 




 fantastic find 




  The interview (or portions of it) have been all over various news outlets.  I am not making the assumption about Batman and Superman being together in a movie. I'm just providing a portion of the interview that everyone seems to be focusing on, "We talked about it."  Read the full interview. 




 I can't wait for this to be released.  It's been too long 




 agreed.  Winick's run at DC has been less than stellar but Barry Ween is his Starman.   




 awesome! 




 sorry, didn't see it but I guess more publicity for this brave little boy the better 




 Similar but yet different.  




 who doesn't like big boobs? 




 Locke   Key is a great suggestions.  Also Image Comics' Chew and Morning Glories are very good and relatively new so easy to jump in to. 




 I can tell you attended a top notch community college using the verbiage "Dude" and "I dunno". I guess English is not a prerequisite for obtaining a journalism "degree" at the University of Phoenix or other online school you may have attended in your esteemed collegiate career. 




 Shocking you would use your real name since I have read some of them.  The one maybe two two original articles that you have written during your esteemed journalistic career.  The rest I read on my blog three days prior to you posting them on Geeks of Doom.  I guess it takes a while to duplicate.

 You just proved my point, "Dragon*Con states in it's official policy that if you attend the convention you will be photographed and wave any legal right to ban such photography."  

How many other people took a picture of Tron girl?  How do you prove that was your photo?  I assume other dragon-con attendees had cameras and took pictures as well.  Perhaps, you were the only attendee allowed to carry a camera?  Maybe you were the official photographer of dragon-con?  

By the way, hard hitting journalism Woodward:  http://geeksofdoom.com/author/techgonzo/.  looks like zero original content to me.  just posting other stories on Geeks of Doom.  

Although, your hard-hitting, investigative stories featured in the Nashville Scene are surely Pulitzer worthy.  

As Judge Smails in CADDYSHACK said, "Well, the world needs ditch diggers, too" 




 It's nice to have an objective moderator.  Who knows what would happen if a reddit moderator was subjective in it decisions?  I guess different rules apply for gfest than every other redditor in this specific genre.   




 Still haven't addresses the legalities of the photo?  You keep ignoring that aspect for some reason.  I guess it's subjective when it comes to journalistic legalities.  It's easy to be the tough guy from a blog but like any cyber-bully as soon as you get in over your head and demonstrate to the world your ignorance you run and hide.   




 First you proved my point.  We are not the same person because I do not know what post you speak of.  

Still didn't address the legality issues.  They teach you that in journalism school?  

Fortunately, Law school, 10 years working for the speaker of the House and President of the Senate and now a decade of professional lobbying taught me how to play by the legal rules.

Also, congrats on your journalism career.  Seems to be going well for you.  Everyone hopes to graduate from journalism school and have a sexy Tron photo as their claim to fame.  hard hitting shit 




 I do attempt to post original content with each post and I do not just post from gfest if you like at my profile.  I give my personal take on that image, story, etc.  I notice that 'tchd' has numerous posts in other reddits that are nothing more than picture without comment.  If i just upload an image (via imgur) like him and then post it (similar to 75 percent of the folks on reddit), am I abiding by the rules?  Will I not be singled out?  Will a thread be blocked that personally attacks me without merit or fact?  Seems to me 'tchd' is cyber-bullying for his own gain.   




 I apologize for my friend not giving you proper credit for your Power Girl photo. 

By the way the photo has been all over the web without your name on it. 

How do I even know you took the photo?  Are you the only one that took the photo of this woman in a Power Girl outfit?  Are there 35 photos of the same woman by different photographers? Do you have a signed contract or waiver of liability from this woman that specifically spells out the licensing of the photo?  Does this woman know that you profited off her photo?  Did she give you written permission to utilize her photo for any type of media?  These are the questions that should be asked, prior to claiming ownership of a photograph taken outside of a closed, credible shoot.  

I feel sorry for you.  I've never seen someone so obsessed with something so trivial.  Unfortunately, It underscores your age and most likely professional capabilities.  Thus, why you are clamoring for attention over a photo of a woman in a Power Girl outfit. It's really quite sad.  




 Nightwingblows and I are not the same person.  I have been reading comic books for nearly 40 years and love every aspect of the comic culture.  I Don't believe (or nightwingblows) spam we just put up content we feel others will enjoy.

 I am married with four children and have a career.  I do the blog for fun, nothing more. I apologize if anyone has been offended by the blog or it's content.  It's a hobby for an old man (compared to most folks on here) that very much enjoys comics and comic related material. 

 It's funny because as you get older and become a parent you try your best to teach your children how to develop into a human being that respects all people and not to single someone out and/or bully for personal gain. When I see a reddit post such as this it reminds me that this practice continues on past childhood. 




 Sources are at bottom of post.  with the exception of the girl post all the others bullets were confirmed by WB, Zach Snyder, Darren Aronofsky and/or David Goyer. Don't mean to span just put up content i feel others will enjoy.  I do the blog for fun, nothing more.   




 I've always planned on reading thus book kept putting it off good review.  Getting it tomorrow 




 Now you are all just being picky.  We've all brought home worse at one-time or another. 




 great list KBPrince0.  Thanks!  Looking forward to heading to these sites to read. 




 I have 52 issues of countdown that I will be happy to give away to some unsuspecting kids.  It will be the scariest thing they get all night.  




 well said 




 Eric Cartman would be proud 




 You mean Marvel's Whore? 




 These prints are wonderful and very creative.  I am definitely getting the Batman/Penguin for my office 




 it was everything i hoped for and more.  Time Travel episode was excellent, "looks like we are going to have to go around again." 




 I hope Apple TV is good this time around 




 I agree Bruce Wayne has, is and should always be Batman.  DC is just confusing the the fans with too many titles with too many different Bat-men 




 The complaint is that Dick Grayson is the Batman in the new JLA 




 I think it is amazing.  Love the rough sketch. powerful. 




 my new religious philosophy 




 From his lips to God's ears 




 sorry.  should have posted the deviantart link.  here it is - http://mikepmitchell.deviantart.com/art/Darkwing-Duck-175589621?q=sort%3Atime+gallery%3Amikepmitchell qo=0
 




 still the greatest picture i have ever seen 




 if you read comics and are following the DCU right now then you should not be upset with the post.  DC released the image for a reason.  not a spoiler.   




 Craig McCracken created the Powerpuff girls not Genndy Tartakovsky Although they met in school and have been very good friends ever since.  Even collaborating on some projects.  McCraken also created Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends.  Tartakovsky created Dexter, Samurai Jack and the original star wars clone wars cartoon. 




 Seaside Florida is the best in my opinion 




 Hulk meets the mask 




 Depending on your age and sensitivity some of these may be offensive but all good places to wet your comic whistle: Bone, Rasl, Preacher, Y-The Last Man, 100 Bullets, Invincible, Walking Dead, Mouse Guard, Boys, Ex Machina, American Jesus, Wormwood, Fables, etc. 




 These aren't so much independents but are outside the typical comic book genre and most importantly are fantastic reads. Bone, Rasl, Preacher, Y-The Last Man, 100 Bullets, Invincible, Walking Dead, Mouse Guard, Boys, Ex Machina, American Jesus, Wormwood, Fables, etc. 




 Thanks for the review.  very well done.   




 Fantastic.  




 My library books are overdue and i need to pay off my fine 




 Blackest Night ran in three books.  Blackest Night was a stand alone book but also the story continued in Green Lantern and Green Lantern Corp.  




 My fingers are crossed that the Ryan Reynolds Costume will not look as bad as it did in the picture.   




 he's fantastic.  love his art.   




 no offense taken.  good to chat with you.  least we both love comics.   




 This is how you pull apart Legos http://enveeapparel.wordpress.com/tag/legos/
 




 yes, i read the book.  I read any comic or graphic novel.  I like the premise of the book.  Millar hooked me with Superman Red Son and American Jesus.   




 I like the book.  Didn't know it was posted already.   




 Sorry, did see it on the board before my post. Apologize if I re-reddited  




 He's weird looking 




 I'd sprinkle some of my Fairy dust on her 




 Becareful.  His poop is really dark matter and it is real heavy  




 Story reads wonderfully.  Superboy needs to carve out his own identity.  He now seems regulated to a background character despite his re-birth.  I also love the Robin/Superboy team-ups. 




 this will help.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman_%28Earth-Two%29
 




 I agree with you 100 percent about the content of this series, but the cover is nice 




 Fry Bitch! 




 poor bastard.  I have four kids too.   




 This is what I read when I log into reddit this morning, "Hopefully I'm not the only person here who finds that site's "breaking news" updates to be tedious and uninteresting, among other complaints." 

It put me in a bad mood.  Hard to swallow when one hypocritical person (Inquiry FM) takes it upon themselves for no reason to start a negative reddit against a blog. 

With that being said, If i offended you I apologize.   




 So it's OK for you to link people to your hour-long podcast, but it is not OK to link people to content on another page?  Seems reasonable.  Or maybe you are just jealous that Gfest blog gets thousands upon thousands of unique visitors a day and it looks like your podcast traffic consists of one unique visitor a day, which would be you. 




 I don't care one way or another about your thoughts on gfest but it seems hypocritical when you are promoting your shitty podcast (Inquiry FM.) to reddit.  FYI, the acoustics in your parents basement don't help the podcast. 




 Well hello Tobias Russell, how is the Bluth family today? 




 sad, sad, I had one of those... 




 i've wasted hours, days, weeks.... 




 Definetly worth the read.  Jack Horner arc is fantastic and the new jack (jack frost - his son) has been very good as well. No jump the shark.  Hood art and good writing.  




 Freaking amazing.   




 I miss it.  BKV never disappoints.  




 Great post! Great list.  Huge Batman fan excited to read a few of these titles. 




 blow job 




 i want one! 




 Amen! 




 dead-on 




 She's nasty regardless 




 fantastic.  I couldn't even make a square 




 need a citizen petition to start a referendum to ensure big tit s are not a crime.  I will be happy do the casting for the TV ads.  




 Chick magnet 




 Despite what the jackass named crunchmuncher posted below, I like the posts and information.  Thank you. 




 Can't Freakin Wait! 




 These are fantastic 




 Did it pop out of her stomach? 




 awesome and true 




 I second the last post 




 I like spicy food 




 The graphics remind me of playing the old Atari 2600 but very creative and well done 




 I'd pay whatever took to kick him in the balls.  




 I LOVE THIS 




 Wonder the pulp tasted? 




 i am laughing but i feel bad about doing so 




 I hard you were good in Precious Miss Sidibe 




 well done 




 i'd hit jake before i was forced to hit that 




 Three Blind Mice, baby! 




 beautifully done.  old suit too.  way better than the new one. 




 i've caught the fever as well 




 I love this comic.  Damn funny.   




 wonderfully cleverl 




 Sweeet 




 Well written and well drawn.  Kudos for developing such a wonderful story 




 Agree, terrible pick for Wonder Woman despite what, Morgue, the overly obsessed Tori Black fan believes.   




 I didn't think you could make Wonder Woman less relevant but DC is working hard to do just that. 




 I heard Steve Jobs got married recently, but he lost is iPhone at a bar on the honeymoon
 




 Love that book. My boys love it too.  




 I hope Robot Santa brings this to me for Christmas 




 I don't even watch soccer and that's damn funny 




 completely awesome
