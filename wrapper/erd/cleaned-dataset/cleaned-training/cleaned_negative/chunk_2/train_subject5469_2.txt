 Over the past year I have been noting rainfall records broken worldwide. People describing these events use the words: torrential, apocalyptic, unusual, extraordinary. I remember an elderly Japanese lady describing one such event (in Japan last year) in this way "The water was coming down so hard I could barely breathe, I felt like I was breathing water."

As stated, I started noting a drastic increase in these events last year- out of past 40 years of serious weather watching. 

[Here is the post I made on it 2013](http://www.reddit.com/r/StormComing/comments/1jzh7q/unheard_of_rains_861388_2013_a_few_samples/).

And here is just the last *7 Days*: 

[Months of Rain Flood Burlington in mere hours](http://www.reddit.com/r/StormComing/comments/2cw4gi/flash_flood_months_of_rain_flood_burlington_in/)

[Mudslides: California Torrential Rain Storm was a nearly 500-year event, officials say](http://www.reddit.com/r/StormComing/comments/2cw3ai/mudslides_california_torrential_rain_storm_was_a/)

[Heavy rains flood downtown Albuquerque](http://www.reddit.com/r/StormComing/comments/2ciw14/heavy_rains_flood_downtown_albuquerque/)

[Floods in Kalyan; 1,500 evacuated | 8in. Rain in several hours.](http://www.reddit.com/r/StormComing/comments/2cav53/floods_in_kalyan_1500_evacuated_8in_rain_in/)

[One dead, homes evacuated after torrential rains in American Samoa](http://www.reddit.com/r/StormComing/comments/2cauh9/one_dead_homes_evacuated_after_torrential_rains/)

[India landslide triggered by heavy rain kills at least 30 - World](http://www.reddit.com/r/StormComing/comments/2casl0/india_landslide_triggered_by_heavy_rain_kills_at/)

Seven Days; *Eight* extraordinary rain events worldwide. In my experience this is utterly unprecedented. One '500 year' rain event is striking enough in a year. The past 2 years we have had multiple 100 and 500 year rainfalls over just a matter of a month or two.

----------------------

Note from Kolby:

The anomalous movement of the Jet Stream continues to reflect the findings of Jennifer Francis (Rutgers) and her associates. 

In a nutshell: that warming in the Arctic is creating deeper meandering loops in the Jet Stream (Rossby Theory) and that this is *slowing* the Jet Stream, leading to 'stuck' highs and cut off lows. In other words, weather systems that would quickly pass or not be as intense are now intense and longer lasting. For example: two weeks of intense rain instead of an hour or a day. These deeper loops are also pulling in weather systems from deeper south or farther north.

Great little explanatory video: http://youtu.be/_nzwJg4Ebzo

In this case, it is superheated air being pulled up into the UK from Spain by a deep 'loop' in the Jet Stream.

"There are fears about violent winds, high waves and tides and torrential rain that we have never experienced before," Satoshi Ebihara, the Japanese weather agency's chief forecaster, told journalists at a Monday news conference.
