 A recent study showed that it is natural for nostrils to have differing air intake volumes under normal conditions. The findings suggest this aids in identification of scents, as the reactions occur differently at a higher volume and an lower volume.

Edit: [Nature.com Article](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v402/n6757/full/402035a0.html)

"The flow of air is greater into one nostril than into the other because there is a slight turbinate swelling in one. The nostril that takes in more air switches from the left to the right one and back again every few hours, but the effect of this switching on the sense of smell has been unclear. Here we show that this difference in airflow between the nostrils causes each nostril to be optimally sensitized to different odorants, so that each nostril conveys a slightly different olfactory image to the brain."

 In 2007 Atheist/Agnostic was 4%. So I could see in the 1980/90s it could have been around 2%.

It also might be that, with increasing acceptance in US society, more people are comfortable stating that they are Atheist/Agnostic. 




 From the survey, the unaffiliated category which is 22.8% of Americans, consists of:

3.1% Atheist

4.0% Agnostic

This last group, while they are included in the unaffiliated group affirm that **religion is either very important or somewhat important in their lives**

 Just the opposite. "Texas seceded from the United States in 1861, and joined the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. It replaced the pro-Union governor, Sam Houston, in the process. During the war, slavery in Texas was little affected, and prices for slaves remained high until the last few months of the war. The number of slaves in the state increased dramatically as the Union Army occupied parts of Arkansas and Louisiana. Slaveholders in those areas often moved their slaves to Texas to avoid having them emancipated. By 1865 there were an estimated 250,000 slaves in Texas."

 In terms of pure heliocentric velocity, the current champions are two probes called Helios I and II that were launched in 1974 and 1976. They entered orbits that took them closer to the Sun than the planet Mercury.

The nearer you orbit to a huge mass like the Sun the faster you have to move, and the Helios sisters moved very fast indeed. Both hit orbital velocities in excess of **70 km/s**  or about 150,000 miles per hour.

the speed of light = **299,792 km/s**

 "Doxing" is a neologism that has evolved over its brief history. It comes from a spelling alteration of the abbreviation "docs" (for "documents") and refers to "compiling and releasing a dossier of personal information on someone". Essentially, doxing is revealing and releasing records of an individual, which were previously private, to the public.

 Kenebrew is represented by civil rights attorney Hank Sherrod, who last year represented Robert Bryant of Kelso, Tennessee.

Sherrod argued that Madison County deputies in the summer of 2012 conspired to stalk, beat and falsely arrest Bryant. Bryant sued Sheriff Dorning and eight deputies, including Countess, in federal court last year.

The county settled with Bryant for $625,000 last year and the FBI then announced it was investigating the deputies.

This lawsuit invokes the Bryant case and related newspaper articles to argue that Dorning and the Madison County Sheriff's Department have a record of ignoring or even covering up police misconduct.

"Deputies under [Sheriff] Dorning's command have learned that their justifications for using force and other unlawful actions will never be questioned," reads the Kenebrew suit, "and that they can act with impunity."

 "I see no chance for Russia now to move from Putin's brutal dictatorship into something that will be even (as) mild as we had 10 years ago," he said, predicting it could take a violent mass uprising if change was to come.

 Tonsils - they had been considered totally useless and were removed if they got infected. Today we know tonsils fight bacteria as part of our immune system. However, it is thought that they have lost their primary role and are thus vestigial.

 The human ear has many vestigial traits. For example, there's a  group of muscles attached to our ears that, for most monkeys, are used to move the ears like satellite dishes trying to pick up a signal. For us they just sit there  not moving anything  suggesting that they've lost their biological function. Except for some of you that can "wiggle" your ears.

That post reminded me of these disturbing fairy tales.  




 OK - - I looked up the moral. I kid you not ... this is what I found ... 

The last line of the fairy tale  its moral  is as follows: "**Lucky people, so tis said, Are blessed by Fortune whilst in bed.**"

 TIL the nurse that owns the cat is just very possessive and insanely jealous of her cat giving affection to others 




 There are 10 of these disturbing fairy tales in the article.

**Sleeping Beauty** - In one of the very earliest versions of this classic story, published in 1634 by Giambattista Basile as Sun, Moon, and Talia, the princess does not prick her finger on a spindle, but rather gets a sliver of flax stuck under her fingernail. She falls down, apparently dead, but her father cannot face the idea of losing her, so he lays her body on a bed in one of his estates. Later, a king out hunting in the woods finds her, and since he cant wake her up, rapes her while shes unconscious, then heads home to his own country. Some time after that, still unconscious, she gives birth to two children, and one of them accidentally sucks the splinter out of her finger, so she wakes up. The king who raped her is already married, but he burns his wife alive so he and Talia can be together. Dont worry, the wife tries to kill and eat the babies first, so its all morally sound.

  according to the CDC 86 cases of measles were reported in the year 2000. ... The whole measles thing by itself is a joke and not a real threat to America.

[From January 1 to January 30, 2015, 102 people from 14 states were reported to have measles](http://www.cdc.gov/measles/cases-outbreaks.html)
"The United States experienced a record number of measles cases **during 2014, with 644 cases from 27 states reported to CDC**'s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD). This is the greatest number of cases since measles elimination was documented in the U.S. in 2000."

* The majority of the people who got measles were unvaccinated.
* Measles is still common in many parts of the world including countries in Europe, Asia, the Pacific, and Africa.
* Travelers with measles continue to bring the disease into the U.S.
* Measles can spread when it reaches a community in the U.S. where groups of people are unvaccinated.

[Chart: US Measles Cases by Year](http://www.cdc.gov/measles/images/measles-cases-616px.jpg) 




 Did you look at the [World Map of the measles outbreaks in 2013](http://www.measlesrubellainitiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/mmr_outbreaks_cropped-640x360.png)?

It's not about skin color - it's about geography.  




 No - the contagion vectors come from outside the Americas.

The spread is due to pools of non-immunized children that are exposed and quickly transmit it to others.

If the children were immunized, the virus brought in from Europe or Africa would not spread.  




 Here's some of the misinformation being spread: 

**Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.)** said individuals who come to the U.S. illegally may be responsible for the recent measles outbreak, contending they dont undergo the stringent health screening others do when they enter the country. I dont think there is any health care professional who has examined the facts who could honestly say that Americans have not died because the disease is brought into America by illegal aliens who are not properly health care screened as lawful immigrants are.

**Rush Limbaugh** - The children coming across the southern U.S. border "were never examined after they got here and quarantined if they had a disease. They were just sent out across the country. Many of them had measles ... We now have an outbreak of it all because of our immigration policy."
