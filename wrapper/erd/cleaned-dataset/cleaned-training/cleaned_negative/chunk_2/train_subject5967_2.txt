 Hey guys,

My room mate is about to try a Soylent diet to lose some weight. He's not a goose, he knows about caloric requirements and nutritional requirements, that's not a problem.

I was wondering if any of you have tried it before? 




 Haha, you're right, I don't do it in that order, it just rolls off the tongue better saying it that way. 




 There has been instances where Buzzfeed has stolen content from reddit. The joke is more specifically targeted at threads in AskReddit where the answers could be made into one of Buzzfeeds stupid articles. So a thread like "What cute thing does your SO do?" could be stolen to make a "25 things that your SO could do to be cute" clickbait monstrosity. 




 I'm still weird like that though. I still love the smell of second hand smoke, but I hate the smell of smokers. There are two completely different aromas there. That being said, I won't let anyone smoke in my car, so there are some hard limits. 




 As an ex smoker, I feel the exact same way. Knowing how repulsive being a smoker is definitely helps me from relapsing. It's totally the same with over eating. If being fat were considered sexy, it would be so much more difficult to lose weight. 




 Not just the habits that are instilled, but also the information provided in general. Do you know anyone who refuses to try to lose weight because 'exercise is hard', they don't even know how that is a non sequitur. I was in that camp too not that long ago, I'd always just assumed that weight loss cant be achieved without exercise.. 




 I personally don't mind them, I think stigmatising overeating worked for me. But I can totally see why others wouldn't want those places to exist.

That being said, here is a thought exercise. Let's say there was a subreddit created called /r/smokerhate. All they did there was shame smokers and post stupid smoker logic. Would you have the same opinion of it as you do about /r/fatpeoplehate? 




 Same goes to you, I liked it the way it was. I remember back in high school psychology reading about a bodily function clock, which dictates when your body has the highest/lowest blood pressure, etc. That body clock also regulates when your body ceases bowel movements. That's why its not typical to wake up needing to go number 2

Edit: I fucking [found it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_rhythm) 




 Having read the book, YES! The book is so much more interesting than the movie. The POV stories from all around the world would make for an amazing episodic story. 




 Haha, I checked none of the boxes for Tyrion. 




 Are you nuts? That mother fucker is super effective against the first two gym trainers. That shit is a solid choice. 




 But a day before 9/11 is still 2 months after the twin tower attacks in NYC, how could I stop it?

A little Australian date formatting joke for you all, enjoy. 




 That was a tongue in cheek comment :P

I'm not worried, I'm just curious if anyone else has experienced it 




 I drink shit loads of water, it's pretty much all I drink. In fact the amount I drink hasn't changed since I started 




 Hello internet friends,

Yeah... So. I'm a man of routine. Alarm goes off at 6:15 am then I'm off to do the 3 S's (Shower, Shit and Shave **not in that order _**). Every Monday morning I would weigh myself right after the second S, so I can get the most accurate reading. About a month or so into my new diet I noticed that I couldn't do the morning movement right after I woke up, now it occurs 2 hours later, like clock work.

Has this happened to anyone else? I'm obviously not ready to call a doctor or anything, but it's frustrating because now my weigh in readings are not going to be as accurate as I'd like. I'm wondering if it has anything to do with the fact that I'm getting better sleep now than I was before. Same number of hours, but definitely more uninterrupted sleep (weightloss = better sleep, yay)

Edit: Clarification on the SSS rule 




 Dinner which wasn't prepared by myself or a chef. 




 I honestly don't know, I feel like I need to buy new clothes but the way I'm losing weight, I'll need to do it again in a few months. Luckily being a guy means I can get away with more baggy clothes. That being said, it's still a bad look lol 




 This reminds me of my first week. I did some snap calculations as to how little i'll need to eat for me to lose weight. So I did some guess-timation on my lunch and dinners for the week. 5 days in I was *convinced* that I was eating too much. So I subscribed to Lite N Easy (weight watchers), which was due to arrive in the next week. I was certain that I couldn't set a 2000 calorie limit correctly.

I guess I was wrong, because on the 7th day I recorded a 3.3 lbs loss! I was never more happy to cancel that Lite N Easy order :D 




  It was the same when you gained the weight in the first place - it crept up on you. 

Oh god, this is so true. I wish it wasn't though .

It has reminded me that I'll probably never stop doing weekly weigh ins.
 




 sandwich. 




  "women only want to date rich men" and "women don't want to **hate** men who are broke or balls deep in **depth**"

I know these are obviously typos, but I still had a giggle.

I totally agree with you, the distinction is important. I certainly don't want to date someone who isn't responsible with their finances or job situation. If you're studying, thats different but if you are just lazy, then no fucking thank you.

 




 Yeah the majority of my mates are men, I had a really close female friend but we had a falling out over something really stupid and she hasn't talked to me since. I made fun of her favourite football team not making it into the finals. Not even kidding, 10 years of friendship down the toilet over that. 




 I started taking the train to work. 

Not even joking, going from a 35-70 minute drive to and from work in heavy traffic to a 45 minute train ride to and from work has done **wonders** to my anger.

Fuck traffic, other than that I don't really have anger issues. 




 I make enough money that I could buy everything every time, but I wont. I think you're better off working off a 'shouting' system. Meet up for coffee? Ill get this one, you can get the next :)

Alternatively, at dinner just pay your own way. Fuck these gender roles, you're an adult right? Buy your own damn stuff. It's fine to spend money on your SO every now and again, but I don't understand the guy paying for everything, thats just silly. 




 I appreciate a movie more if it makes sense scientifically. If it's overt in its ignorance, I take issue with it.

The^neutrinos^are^mutating... 




 Ok, cynicism aside - my question is about what he *would* play if he *were* tapped for a Marvel movie. 




  You sound worse

That's not very nice /u/citizensssnips.

 




 Why? 




 Question in the title.

I saw some brief rumors about him potentially playing the heir apparent to Tony Stark as Iron Man. The kid is currently 13 years old, so if he were to take over from RDJ after Avengers pt 4, he would be 18~ years old.

What do you think he could play in future movies? 




 I saw the movie, loved it. I then read the comics, loved it. I then rewatched the movie and loved it even more.

Those criticisms are not fair, the reception of an adaptation shouldn't be measured on its accuracy to the source material, it should be on it's own unbiased merit. I really liked the changed ending in the movie, it felt natural and it made sense.

Stellar movie, 10/10 would watch again. Especially the extended addition. It is easily Snyders best film, sorry 300 : 




 Yes! The dude who does the voice over does an amazing job 




 Thanks for linking this sub. I've been following the Martian progress (loved the books) for ages. I'm glad we're finally getting snippets of information! SO EXCITED! 




 That's the catch 22 of this subreddit. It's an amazing support network with shit loads of awesome information... But daily usage can make your progress seem slower since you're constantly thinking about your loss.

 




 I still **love** it, over the past 11 weeks I've only had drinks twice. Once for a bucks and once for a 30th birthday party. Otherwise I've been sober. I miss having a beer with dinner, but the way I rationalise it is "I've drank enough beer in my life, I need a hiatus".

I won't be a teetotaler for the rest of my life, just until I get my weight back in check. 




 It does make sense, I thought it was weird that the camera stayed so long on this unknown extra. That's the exact thing D D would do for a cameo. 




 Nice one man! I **guarantee** that in a few weeks time, you'll think "Damn, why didn't I start this earlier". The old proverb holds true.

**"The best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago, the second best time is right now."** 




 It's only slow because you're focusing on it too much, let your changes become part of a daily routine and time will go super fast. 




 Yep, I'm going to be visiting another friend interstate at the end of June who I've not seen in months too. By then I should be down to 40 lbs :D 




 I take pictures at every month interval. The 2 month photos show some change, but not much. Not enough (in my mind) to warrant asking "did you lose weight". Obviously I'm wrong, my friend had no idea that I'd been losing weight :) 




 Thanks! It's been surprisingly easy. Turns out that eating like this is how normal people eat and they do it every day without thinking. 




 What I eat for lunch pretty much hasn't changed, my biggest problem was dinner and how much beer I drank.

Looking back on it now, it was an insane amount. So much so that I would bet the large part of my weight loss is from cutting out beer and drinking water/coffee. 




 Hey guys,

I'm currently in my 11th week of my weight loss journey and my change of diet no longer feels foreign, it's now *just how I eat*.

I'm 31 lbs down from my starting weight of 285. I've struggled to notice the difference in the mirror, despite my belt going down some notches and my shirts feeling looser than normal.

Tonight was a good night, I bumped into a friend that I've not seen in months. "Holy shit train_subject5967, have you lost weight?", "Yeah, I've lost a few Kilos ;)", "I almost didn't recognise you!".

A simple exchange like that, I'm still buzzing. That was an objective and unsolicited view of my progress, really made my night.

Do not fret my friends, if you're just starting out and are frustrated at the speed of your progress. Trust me when I say this - it goes **insanely** quickly. These 11 weeks have been a blur. Just keep at it and everything gets easier with every passing second :D

 




 Any secret to it? Or did it just kinda happen the way it happened?

You carry it really well! 




 See the problem is that for the past 10 years I've been playing competitive 8 ball, I'm quite good.

I don't bring my A game with anyone I play unless they also play competitively. It's not a 'letting them win' thing, its a 'I love playing pool, so I want my friends to want to play with me' thing.

So I'm not letting people win, but I'm turning down my game to like a 5/10 




 My friends? No, as long as they're happy I couldn't care less how they go about their week days. I have friends who are in retail and some who are doctors and lawyers. I never feel better than anyone.  




 I'm 27 years old and the last time I cried was almost 10 years ago. I had a physical altercation with my father and broke down at a mates house. I felt so embarrassed since he had mates around. But he was a really good friend, who sat me down away from them and supported me. 

Once I calmed down, i went back and joined his mates and had a laugh. No one mentioned it again. It was good because he saw me at my worst and so did his mates and no one judged me.  




 It depends on the relationship and who breaks up with who. When I was younger, i dated this amazing girl who after almost 2 years, broke it off with me. I was inconsolable. It has been around 8 years since then and I still think about her. Hurt like hell.

Other times, I've not felt as much. The most recent was a 10 month relationship with a nice enough girl, who had a whole host of anxiety problems. I enjoyed her company, she got along with my friends and was a very bright individual. But those anxiety problems were just too much to deal with in the end and I came to realise that I couldn't keep dating her (there is a lot more to the break up, I can elaborate if you want). So I ended it. Instead of feeling upset about it, I felt relieved. It was strange actually. 




 It was a sad day where my stuffed jaguar named Jag was put into storage. 




 Why the hell not? It's lovely and warm and there's plenty of room :) 




 Glad I could help. If you can't tell, my favourite character is Carl Drogo. 




 Kissing. I mean seriously. You don't just passionately press your faces together. There is more to it. 




 I'm so sick of this shit, I hate it when people call her 'Dany'. Do they not realised that Dany is a title given to Khaleesi by the Dothraki? It means princess.

Some people are so fucking ignorant. 




 And last but not least, Jons "death" could be used as a plot device which relieves him of his Nightwatch duties and frees him up for other storylines without making him a deserter.

This is one of the biggest pieces of evidence for his resurrection. I remember when Mel had that show only conversation with Thoros about how he ressed Beric, I was thinking "Oh, I see. Now that Mel knows about resurrection, it wont be a shock when she does it to Jon", clever. 




 It wasn't just that, there was all of this circle jerk by the writers and director about how the episode was "The best they've ever done" and it ended up being rather subpar in the context of the show.

Happy cake day btw :P 




 Nice job man, hows the loose skin situation? 




 Same with quitting drinking. I was buying 1-2 slabs of beer per week (not including drinks when I went out on the weekends) which could be upwards of $150 per week on booze. That's insane.  




 Its been almost 3 months for me and I couldn't agree more! I've cooked every since dinner since that 3 month start and I can't even stand the sight of fast food. Give me a fresh and juice steak over mcdonalds any day of the week.

I work in the city and there are so many places to get a awesome lunch. The cafe in my work lobby makes a awesome minestrone soup in house..... Fuck it, I'm getting that today for lunch :D 




 I'm kicking myself that I didn't start sooner. I really am. It's really not that hard to start, I'm a stubborn mother fucker so I just focus my stubbornness into my change of life style. 




 I don't weigh daily but I do experience what you're showing here. For example, I record my weigh ins every Monday morning right before I get ready for work. Yesterday (Sunday) I weighed myself and saw I had lose 1.2kgs from the previous monday (yay). Knowing that, I did my official weigh in the following morning and I had apparently gained 2 kilograms from the previous week. WTF body, your mass retention is just plain silly.

I obviously didn't gain 2kgs of fat overnight, so fuck you body, I'm recording yesterdays loss. 




 I love making my friends and family laugh. So in that regard, I care about social media.

If I tell a joke which gives someone a laugh and brightens their morning, then I consider the effort worth while. 




 Excellent action movie, really surprised me since it had been in development hell for so many years. 10/10, best movie of 2015.

That aside, I don't get all of the feminism/anti-feminism shit which has sprouted up from the ethos. Why can't people just enjoy something for what it is instead of finding meaning which serves their personal agenda?  

I feel like I'm on the wrong website to ask such a question lol 




 I have a 5 inch wide burn scar on my left calf muscle which was caused by a hysterical woman and a motorcycle. Interested?

I grew up on a fairly large property and had been motorbike riding since I was a youngster. One day when I was 17, I had a few mates around and they begged me to give them a dink (aussie slang for riding a bike tandem). I said yes and explained to them a simple rule for riding tandem. **Lean the way I lean**. Balance is everything when riding a motorbike.

So anyway for the next 45 minutes or so I was giving my mates the time of their lives, everyone was really excited. There was one girl left who hadn't had a ride and was rather shy about it. She eventually got the courage to get on the back and go for a ride. I'm not a dick, I went extra slow for her, I know she was nervous. As we go along she starts to get more confident asking me to go faster. So I oblige her. 

This is where everything goes pear shaped. We get to the final bend of my circuit which is a fairly tight turn on wet grass. I take the corner at a liberal speed and lean into the turn, she *forgets* the golden rule about leaning and leans the opposite direction which causes massive under steer and we end up crashing into the ground. It was a relatively slow impact so no broken bones. 

Let me explain what's wrong about this picture. There I am, 17 years old with a girl latched onto my back with a 120kg motorbike pinning me down, which has its *red hot* exhaust pipe pinned against my left calf muscle. I'm screaming bloody murder for this girl to let go of me so I can get out from under the bike and her screaming even louder, seemingly unable to let go of me out of sheer terror.

It took her around 30 agonising seconds to finally let go of me so I could get out from underneath the bike. I have had a few bits of pain in my day but that one was the worst of them. Not only that, but the pain of recovery over the next few months was horrible too. I don't really dink my mates around anymore, that was a shit time. Not as much a *stupid* story, I'm told it was hilarious though. 




 It is, it doesn't look like much when written down. But when it's pronounced, the letters all flow well.

It's like *sequestered*, Q is a really awesome letter. 




 I love that word, I think the noun sounds better than the verb though. **Defenestration**, I recall learning that word while wikipedia hopping. How the fuck is there a word for such a specific act? lol 




 This one comes up often and unexpectedly. 




 Good one, I use this one often for work. Feels classy as fuck. 




 Dude, that word is a god damn nightmare. It's like *comparable*, there are so many moving parts that trying to spell or pronounce it can make you look stupid. 




 *shudder* 




 Mine is **frivolity**. 

It rolls off the tongue so well, using it in a sentence instantly classes the place up. Of course I see the irony of being the OP in a seemingly frivolous askreddit thread. 




 If you're weird like me, you'll hear/see a word and suddenly think "that is such a cool word". That word then becomes your favourite word for the day. This word could be considered 'cool' because of its meaning, the way its pronounced or even because of the definition. 

That being said, what is your favourite word for the day?

**Edit: Let's get meta, does anyone know if there's a word for 'finding words pleasing'? I'm sure it's some sort of sexual kink.** 




 I'm putting my money on the fact that this comment is complete and utter hyperbole.

I hate to play the pessimist, but experience tells me that every time you hear a comment from an actor for an upcoming episode, it has been crafted in such a way as to build hype, rather than prepare the audience for an event.

Remember the hype around last seasons final episode? It was being built up as a ground breaking piece of television. Remember how anticlimactic it was for us?

Scary^Spooky^Skeletons 




 As long as you factor it into your budget, then it's perfectly fine. 




 (Posted on 5-20-15, weight: 230.6) (shamelessly using this post as a "before" shot)

That's not shameless at all, that's actually quite clever. I text my weigh in results to myself every week so I have them stored and readily accessible.

GJ on the self control 




 In my head a;ldkfjaf! I have fought for every single pound I have lost, thank you very much. You dont know me, or my body. My PCOS has made it damn-near impossible to lose weight; but Ive powered through. Ive given up all of those cookies and donuts I see you grab in the breakroom. This 23 lbs was NOT EASY!!!

Does this person know all this background information? I mean, I know he/she has made a snap judgement about how difficult your weight loss was, but what does your success look like to them? They probably see a happy person who is proud of their weight loss and assume that you're able to lose the weight easily.

I'm not saying that they're assumption was correct, but I wouldn't get too frustrated with someone for not knowing the whole story about you. Some people have an easy time losing weight.

Congratulations on 23lbs lost though :) 




 Pure curiosity here. Does anyone like the sand snakes and the Dorne plot as a whole? I can see reddit has made up its hive mind in some threads but are there any positives anyone has taken away from these new characters?

Edit: Do not down vote someone just because you disagree, that's not how reddit works. 




 Hey guys,

I know this might sound like a silly question, but is an elevated heart rate from non physical exercise still burning calories like exercising would do?

I ask because I play competition 8 ball and at times, it can get the heart rate up. I put myself in late so I end up playing the clutch games for the night. A combination of nerves and excitement can actually lead to a sustained heart rate of 168~. My question is, does that elevated heart rate equate to calories burned in the same way exercise would even though what I'm doing isn't physically exhausting?

Edit for clarification: I'm quite sure that the two are not comparable, I'm just after the specifics if any 









 Hey guys,

I've since changed my exercise regime. I was previously trying to walk every day but I was finding this wholly unsustainable. I've since decided to do 45-60 minutes of fast walking (with jogging intervals of 5 minutes) every Saturday and Sunday. Already I can see how this is far better in the long run, I feel much better. It was at the stage where some week days I'd get home from work, I would have to get changed, do my workout, cook dinner, eat it and then I only had like 5 minutes before I had to be somewhere. It was getting a bit hectic.


**How often do you exercise every week? What exercise do you do? How do you rationlise what you do and how often you do it?** 




 I was wondering why the hoodie I wear every day in the colder months feels weird. I kept trying to roll the sleeves up and they just wouldn't stay up. The sleeves are also longer for some reason. Also, the bottom of the zipper seems further away than normal.

Some seriously strange witchcraft is going on here guys. I think I'll need to buy a new hoodie, this one is suddenly defective. 




 This may help others get jump started and may re-spark your own efforts!

**What event(s), feeling, realisation, etc started your efforts?**

I've been procrastinating losing this weight for years. My maternal grandfather died of a heart attack at 38 and his son (my maternal uncle) survived a heart attack at 38. Turns out I have some form of congenital heart condition on my mothers side.

That itself didn't stop me from digging this hole I'm in, but the cognitive dissonance is strong with me. "I'll lose my weight soon.", "I won't have to get healthy for another 10+ years".

As you can see that is a horrible loop to be stuck in. Something else happened. A few months ago I was reading a 50 year study done on the mortality rate of smoking cessation. I had myself quit smoking back in mid 2013 and was curious as to my chances of dodging a proverbial bullet.

Statistically speak, it turns out I had.

The study showed that the subjects who were heavy smokers in their teens and 20s (I'm 27 and I've been mostly smoking since 16), who quit by 30 lived (on average)  as long as those who never smoked.

What a relief to hear, I kinda knew instinctively that was the case but it was a good little pick me up. But then the realisation came crashing down.

"Awesome! I'm likely to reach 80 due to quitting. **Wait, no I'm fucking not. I'm not going to reach 50 the way I'm living**"

I put the booze down, cut down what I ate, became more active and I've been losing weight ever since. Fuck you complacency, I'm in charge now. I'm using my ingrained stubbornness against my own vices. I don't know why this time is different than every other time, but it fucking is.

 




 Hey guys,

I know for a lot of newer people (and some veterans) getting motivated is such a hard thing to do. Most of the time the motivation comes far too late in a persons life. To those who are struggling, I would highly recommend watching [Fed Up](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fed_Up_(film)), it is a documentary which came out last year about the effects of the sugar industry in the world and the impact of obesity in any society.

It goes into great detail about daily diet and processed food, it also covers the history behind the way lots of laws are currently set up. This documentary is currently available on Netflix, I hope it gives you all a push to realise what the right thing to do is.

The truth of the matter is frightening, it's important that we all know it.
 




 While it's obvious which will be ranked the worst (god damn it, Jai Courtney. You were so good in Spartacus -.-), I'm genuinly curious as to how others view the other movies by comparison. 

I would rank them (using shorthand for the movie titles):

**1) Die Hard 1**

**2) Die Hard 3**

**3) Die Hard 4**

**4) Die Hard 2**

**5) Die Hard 5**

I honestly don't get a lot of the hate I see for Die Hard 4, it was a clear winner over the second one and in my opinion it's close behind Die Hard 3. I liked the fish out of water situation of McLane being thrown into a plot concerning cyber terrorism and I think Justin Long was a good foil for Willis. 

What is your order? Please, **PLEASE** don't just downvote people you disagree with, it runs rampant in this subreddit. Downvoting should **only** be done when someone adds nothing to the discussion. 




 Hey guys, 

I had the chance to rewatch Mel Gibson's film Apocalypto recently and it reminded me of how good of a film maker Gibson can be. What a movie. The characters, the setting, the intrigue and the action were all amazing. I was then shocked to see how it was critically received, 65% on RT is a great injustice to the quality of the film. It's a curious reaction from critics since 2006 was the year of the majority of the controversy which Mel Gibson was involved with.

To add to this, the movie garnered big support from the film industry.  

[Actor Robert Duvall called it "maybe the best movie I've seen in 25 years". Director Quentin Tarantino said, "I think it's a masterpiece. It was perhaps the best film of that year. I think it was the best artistic film of that year." Actor Edward James Olmos said, "I was totally caught off guard. It's arguably the best movie I've seen in years. I was blown away." In 2013, director Spike Lee put the film on his list of all-time essential films.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalypto#Critical_response)

So what did you think of the movie? Did you feel it was overrated or underrated? Were Mel Gibson's personal troubles part of the reason for such a luke warm reception? 




 Hey guys,

So last month I had a bucks and I'd been off booze and had been eating healthy for the past 6 weeks. But, come on, its my best mates bucks party. I'm going to celebrate the shit outta that and I most certainly did.

I had some guilt the following day until I actually read the report of my daily activity from my fitbit. [Holy shit did it tell a story](http://i.imgur.com/0JPbTxT.png). I had not realised how active we were. The fact that we were up at 9am till 3am with all sorts of activities during the day countered quite a bit of the unhealthy consumption that accompanied it.


Either way, have a cheat once and a while people! It helps maintain your sanity!
 




 I've read a few studies about the effects of sleep on weight loss and a common finding was that those who had solid sleep were capable of losing more than those who didn't sleep well.

How much sleep do you guys get and how do you think it's affected your weight loss?

Edit: I currently get between 6-7 hours sleep per night, but I'm starting to think that isn't enough lol. I'm not overly tired and I know that the 6-7 hours I get are solid 









 Story time!

I've been struggling with my weight most of my adult life, it became worst during my early 20s. I loved beer, loved food, loved smoking and hated exercise. A recipe for disaster indeed. 2 months ago I had enough. It wasn't a depression thing, I had become *comfortable* with my weight and I had been overall happy irrespective of it. That comfort with being a fat person lead me to just not care anymore about my weight. 

This led to a sort of apathy towards my romantic life and my weight. I didn't care how much I drank or how much I ate. That all changed 2 months ago. Several small events lead me to start. I stopped drinking, cut my portions dramatically and started exercising. I did plenty of research. /r/loseit, /r/progresspics and /r/fitness really helped. **Shoutout to you sexy mother fuckers**. I'm on an 1800-2000 cal budget and I walk 3-4 times a week 30-45 mins. I'm really looking forward to losing more weight, I can't wait to start jogging.

So here we are. 2 months in and 24 pounds down. This isn't a diet. This is a permanent fix to my broken world. I would like to thank everyone for posting as you have been, it really helps.

It may not show, but there is some serious progress in these pictures. I'll post again in a little bit. Enjoy

[**27m 5"10 SW: 285, CW: 261 GW: 220, 24lbs lost**](http://i.imgur.com/SsNNEjr.jpg)


 









 Hey guys,

I'm at week 7 (yay!) since I started my journey and it seems that my weekly weigh ins vary all over the place. I weigh myself every Monday morning at 6:15am naked, after I go to the bathroom. SW: 284.9 5"10 27 y/o male. I'm on a 1800-2000 diet, for the first 5 weeks I was walking 30-40 mins each day (less now because autumn is cold as shit). My diet has not changed.

Here are the results:

- Week 0: 284.9 lbs (first weigh in)

- Week 1: 281.6 lbs **3.3 lbs loss**

- Week 2: 277.2 lbs **4.4 lbs loss**

- Week 3: 274.1 lbs **3.1 lbs loss**

- Week 4: 267.7 lbs **6.4 lbs loss**

- Week 5: 267.7 lbs **0 lbs loss**

- Week 6: 265.3 lbs **2.4 lbs loss**

- Week 7: 264.4 lbs **0.9 lbs loss**

So as you can see there is quite a variation between each week. Obviously, early on I was shedding lots of water weight. Has anyone else experienced losses like this?

I'm going to start going walking again tonight, hopefully it isn't as cold as it has been .



 














 Hey guys,

I know that its not possible to burn fat from specific areas, but is it known the order of which the body burns from? 




 Hey guys,

There were many reasons for my decision to get my arse into gear and lose this weight. One of the more tangible ones occurred a week or so before I started. I went to kmart to get some miscellaneous items and thought to myself "Oh, I need a new belt too, my old one broke.". So being in a hurry, I quickly grabbed the largest sized belt I could and bought everything.

When I got home I tried to wear it, but I was shocked to see that I couldn't even get the ends of the belt to reach around me. What a fucking downer, especially since in my haste I didn't keep the receipt. Its been almost 6 weeks since that day and I've been working my arse off to undo all of the years since.

Today I found that belt (which I thought I threw out) and decided to try to put it on.

I'm on the **Second. Fucking. Notch.** Fuck yeah, what an excellent piece of validation. It's go time bitches. 

Also, as of this morning I hit my 20 lbs mark. Flair-eon I choose you. 




 Hey guys,

Last week I bought a Fitbit Charger HR, I've been happy with the helpful statistics and the rather robust app. It even has a good calorie counting portion of the app :)

For example, yesterday (a normal 'sedentary' work day) with a 30 minute walk stacked up 7800~ steps and I burned 3762 total calories. So with my standard 1800 calorie died, thats one mother fucker of a deficit. And that wasn't even a standard work out. I burned 2 times as many calroies during Sundays workout (which was more typical), which would've pushed me well over 4000 calories burned for the day.

Has anyone else had some interested results from their Fitbit? 









 Hey guys,

This morning was the week 5 weigh in and I was surprised to see that today my weight had not changed. Literally zero gain or loss. Since I'm a heavy lurker around here, I'm very much aware of how plateaus can occur and not to freak out and revert to my old habits. All I can do is keep to my new habits by eating correct and exercising and wait for the plateau to break.

How quickly did you hit a stall in your loss? How did you overcome it? How long did it take?

**Edit: Ok, so maybe its too soon for me to call my week without gain a 'plateau'. Lets discuss my questions then :)**

 




 Hey guys,

For years I've been doing this, I'll have a big dinner(5-6pm) then not eat again till lunch the next day with nearly zero snacking, this being the 18-20 hour fasting strategy. This was for no reason other than laziness and not normally feeling hungry in the mornings. Then after some googling, I discovered that this 'intermittent fasting' is a legitimate technique for weight loss and appetite management.

Since I've started my weight loss journey I've been following this self taught system and it seems to be working wonders. I do get hungry at around 10-11pm but I'm a stubborn bastard and I won't let it get the better of me. 

What are you experiences/opinions of intermittent fasting? 









 What a last week it has been! I started with my first weigh in on Monday 9th March at **284.9**. I cut out beer, halved my portions and started walking everyday. In the first week I was not sure if my diet was working at all. I (stupidly) was weighing myself every day and with no change at the 5th day I was convinced that I'd not calculated my caloric deficit correctly, then...

**WHOOSH**

- *Monday 16th March* came, the weigh in, **281.6**. I lost a little bit under 3 pounds in the first week. Which gave me more motivation than anything. What a damn feeling. I kept going on with this diet and exercise plan, everyday feeling better than the last. Here are the weigh ins.

- *Monday 23rd March*, **277.2**. I lost even more this week (4.4 pounds), mostly water weight I'm sure.

- *Monday 30th March*, **274.1**. Lost 3.1 pounds, slowing down a little bit. I thought *ok, water weight gone. It's been 3 weeks, time to slow down surely.*

**FUCKING WHOOSH**

- *Monday 6th April*, **267.7**.  Lost **6.4** pounds, thats 17.2 pounds in a month! I had to weigh myself 5-6 times I couldn't believe it. I'll be putting up progress pics in a month or so once it starts to show better :)

Thank you all at /r/loseit and /r/progresspics, helped me get motivated so well. You guys rock. 









 Post away guys, I want to hear all of your favourite NSVs, I know everyone has several that shocked them.

I know I'm only just starting my journey, but I've noticed several things. I'm not sweating as bad during the day during normal activities, I have energy I've not had in years and I've not slept this fully in the longest of times (may have had sleep apnea) 




 As of this morning I weighed in at 274.3, thats 10 pounds in 3 weeks. Almost 5kgs, after never having really tried to lose weight in the past I had no idea how quickly it could be done.

I walk everyday but I know confidently that the main source of this has been my control of my portions and cutting beer out of the equation. Thanks to this subreddit as well as /r/fitness and /r/progresspics. Motivation was very easy to gain from these subreddits.

Don't think I wont keep you guys updated. As an additional NSV, I'm now able to pinch the top layer of skin off my gut, I can actually feel my body breaking down the fat and my skin loosening. Good times ensue. 



















 I don't actually have a team I want to win! I know that sounds weird but since both will be awesome competition in the finals, I have no horse in this race.

This means that I can just sit back and enjoy the game! What a corker its going to be :) 




 ...Makes me nauseous. I know I've only just started my journey but with the boys bringing lots of fast food over to my place on the weekend, the smell and look of it made me feel sick. Its a good thing, I have zero cravings for it. A nice juicy steak with fresh salad and some mustard... Oh sweet jesus, now thats a fucking meal. 




 Its so hard to imagine that I could burn away something as tangible as a whole brick worth of weight in 2 weeks.

Yikes this is going to be a fun bunch of months.

Edit: For the sake of context. SW:285 GW: 220, 27 y/o 5"11 male

There is no secret to my regime. I quit drinking (I used to drink **a lot** of beer), halved my portions, drink only water (save for a coffee here and there), stopped eating take out and aside from a cheat day my diet has not really changed (meaning same similar foods, just less). I also walk 4kms per day. I use RuntasticPro to keep track of my exercise. [Here are the basic stats from the last 15 days](http://i.imgur.com/CeRa1FR.png) 









 Australia vs Pakistan at Adelaide oval! What a quarterfinal this will be!

Are we going to see some Starc magic? A massive Warner/Finch opening? Perhaps a historic batting appearance for Smith (praise be to him)?

Whose going to be man of the match? Bat or field first?

TAKING A HALF DAY OFF WORK TO WATCH THE GAME AT HOME WITH THE BOYS, WOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! 














 Hey so ive just started my weight loss effort, im a 27 yo male, sw 285 gw 220, 5"11. Weeks ago I initially started by cutting back on beer, then cut my portions down. Then i started walking 4kms a day, stopped drinking beer, started drinking lots of water and added more fruits and vegis. Its been a week since my first weigh in and.. ive lost 3.3 pounds. Way more than i expected since my diet has been kind off the cuff guessing as far as calories goes. im certainly not under eating, though i do get some hunger, nothing which isnt manageable.

I was just wondering if this ammount of loss is typical for someone my size whose just started? Should i tweek my diet to have more calories? My intention was to avoid the loose skin problem by loosing weigh in a more paitent manner.

That being said, i feel great! 




 Hey guys,

Its a concern for all of us who are hoping to lose that weight, I've read up and down about how you pretty much can't do anything about the majority of the loose skin. You can stay well hydrated and exfoliate. But aside from age, gender or genetic factors, you're going to experience loose skin.

I've just started my journey and I was after some clarification as to what is a good rate of loss to best counter loose skin.

I'm a 27 y/o male, 5"11 285lbs. Target weight of 210 lbs.

Bonus points if anyone similar size to me has an experience to share on the subject :)

Edit: I should add that this issue isn't going to stop me from losing my weight, no way. 



















 Hello friends,

I've been doing some research into my own diet and exercise regime. One of things I've calculated is my BMR (base metabolic rate), its around 2300 kcal. Further investigation showed that since thats the BASE rate, I needed to factor in activity levels. So with the daily exercise I've been doing (45 minutes of 6 kmph walking), that metabolic rate jumps up to around 3900 kcal. Does that mean that on a 2500 kcal diet I'd be burning around 1400 kcal per day just from my diet plus what ever I burn from the actual exercise?

This is all very new to me, be gentle.

Edit: Those numbers were estimates off memory. But for contexts sake ill give you some info (im a metric system person so these should be right :P). I'm 27, male, 5"11, 285lb and I'm not sure on body fat %, havn't measured it. 




 Question in the title, what show baffles you as to why its so popular.

 




 What a game. Seriously what a fucking game. I knew going into Sunday that Sri Lanka would put up a fight, but this was an amazing one.

After a very strong batting performance by us, I was convinced it would be a strong win. 376 is a safe score? Right?

Almost wrong, you guys really showed heart out there. I have to agree with Pup there, I wasn't convinced in our win until the last wicket went down. The highs and lows of that game was doing some serious work on my blood pressure, at least until Englands game yesterday #lolengland

This is truly an amazing time for cricket and I look forward to our probable face off again in the qualifiers :D
