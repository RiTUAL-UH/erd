 Oh, you 




 One of my favorite tony twist moments, I dont remember the year but Its opening game of the season. The Blues win 1 zip over the Sabers on the strength of goal that goes in off of Tony Twists skate.  Post game interview Tony gets asked, how does it feel to be the top scorer on the team? Youre on a pace to score 82 goals!

 I don't know if i would say it's better in terms of pure production but it's up there and it's certainly a more complete overall record. 




 Dunno if you've checked out the new Killer Mike record but in my mind it's probably the best work that El-P has ever done.

 I wouldn't hold my breath for later this year but Del and Dan the Automator do release updates from time to time. They are working on it. 




 My brother lives in a building nearby and sent me these.

 I see it as a cultural construct; a place to put the others who dont belong.  Hell was invented by people who were very sure they were not going there.

Unless you're willing to accept double predestination I don't think you can reconcile the christian concept of grace with the existence of hell. The Biblical support for the idea of hell is dicey at best.
