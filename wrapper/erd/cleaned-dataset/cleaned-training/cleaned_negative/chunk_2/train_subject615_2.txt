 I would like some opionions on this new series...I`m conflicted about watching it...Any comments? 









 1) The Sopranos (it`a an absolute must)
2) Game of Thrones
3) The Big Bang Theory
4) Two and a Half Men (no Ashton seasons, only the Charlie Sheen ones)
5) How I met Your Mother (`though the last season is kinda dissapointing) 




 Ok, if you haven`t noticed, I`m a few days old on reddit so...I haven`t had the time to read all the things that have been written on this matter....
 




 Money beats being selective any day...I know, they don`t need it..but still, the rich will always want to be richer... 




 Finally! Someone who had the guts to say it! I applaude your courage! I`m with you on this matter....I like Sandy but this movie kinda ruined her as an actress for me...over hyped! 









 I actually start to care about Christie and Alaks story this season. Last season they were more part of their parents story but they really are coming into their on in this season. 




 Thanks a lot! 




 I hope there is...I am kinda sick of all this drama with them two...let it be over with and let the show `come back to normal` like in the first 2 seasons!!! 




 Seriously? that`s too much though!! 




 ooo...ok, i`m so sorry, i did not know about that! i`ll never do it again!!! sorry!! 




 Yep...apparently...
