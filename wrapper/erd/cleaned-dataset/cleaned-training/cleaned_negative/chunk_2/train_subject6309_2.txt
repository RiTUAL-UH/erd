 PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN!!! (It is beautifully musky, damp, swampy and just altogether Disney! 




 I have a kiddo that sounds just like this kid ,Cameron. I agree with what everyone has said about positive reinforcement, but all of that can take time.

I would suggest a simple change. Do not ask, tell. 
For example, rather than saying " I'd like you to stop talking", say "Cameron, stop talking" or you could put a more positive spin on it and say "Cameron, this is important. You'll want to hear this."

Also, try to have as many of these conversations in private, unless he is shouting out during your instruction. 




 I drink a good deal of wine the first week as well ;)
