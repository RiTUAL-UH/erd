 Everyone here complains about being lonely, but they resent seeing people happy and in a relationship anyways! 




 what's that?
 




 actually safest with him :) 














 I have this one outfit with a hood and an awesome bra that makes me look like a monster haha! But it's winter in Canada and it's cold now so i can't wear tutu's and stuff, I actually need shorts. 




 These are awesome!! haha :) I love seeing themes! I honestly never get pictures when i'm at raves, I do nothing but dance and glove, so this time I got a picture before i went! i'm jealous you have such an awesome pic durring the event! 




 thanks for defending me! You understood exactly. I didn't claim it was original and I know others dress similarly because it's a pretty typical attire at raves now, but I still think it can be made into a lot of fun and creativity. You can't see it in the picture but i'm also wearing a homemade mask and light up bow. So it's crafting too!  




 I invite anyone to post their costumes below!!! I love seeing new ideas! 









 A quick, to the point answer. Something I appreciate :) thanks! that's pretty cool 









 I think overbites are cute for some reason! But Olivia Wilde is a good example. Maybe i have less to worry about than i previously assumed haha 




 You look better without them, it draws the attention to your eyes which are very nice :) 




 well that's my smile so.... bummer.
