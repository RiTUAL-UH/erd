 The VA estimates that an average of 18 veterans per day commit suicide, or 1 out of 5 suicides in the U.S. 




 A one-day attack on US soil eleven years ago unleashed a never-ending campaign of violence around the world from the target and its allies. Is it really a challenge to understand that continuous bombings and civilian-killing assaults over many years, in many Muslim countries, will generate the same desire for aggression and vengeance against the US?

Why can't *YOU* understand this? 




 If Obama is really the peace president

When was Obama ever a "peace president?" 




 Here's the headline and story.  You be the judge: [Romney Says Remarks on Voters Help Clarify Position - Mr. Romney said he stands by comments that he said demonstrates his belief in the power of free enterprise rather than a growing reliance on largess from the federal treasury.](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/19/us/politics/in-leaked-video-romney-says-middle-east-peace-process-likely-to-remain-unsolved-problem.html?_r=0) 




 I posted a story at r/politics yesterday from the New York Times w/ a headline written by the NYT and they pulled it b/c they said it was "editorialized." 




 Because otherwise some people in the military-industrial complex will [lose their jobs](http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/defense-industry-is-reshaping-itself-in-a-multitude-of-ways/2012/09/19/736c31ac-fdc0-11e1-b153-218509a954e1_story.html?hpid=z3). 




 We wanted to attack Camp Phoenix to kill the Americans but were stopped by the Afghan police, and we had to attack the police, said protester Ajmal Hotak, a 26-year-old shopkeeper.

 [From the AP](http://www.stripes.com/news/africa/us-officials-attack-on-consulate-in-libya-may-have-been-planned-1.189017):  US officials say attack on consulate in Libya may have been planned 




 Huh?  I said the attacks were planned and used the movie to rile up the mob.  That's exactly what happened. 




 The whole article is worth a read to give you some insight into the mind of a neocon.  It's clear, he really believes his own rhetoric. 




 [From USA Today](http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/story/2012/09/12/obama-tightens-security-after-diplomats-killed-in-libya/57752828/1): Days of planning and online promotion by hard-line Islamist leaders helped whip up the mobs that stormed the U.S. Embassy in Egypt and launched a deadly attack on the U.S. Embassy in Libya that killed an ambassador and three others. 




 Do you remember that we recently bombed Libya for months?  Do you think this may have had something to do w/ stirring up some angst against the U.S.?  Do you remember when Hillary Clinton said, "We came, we saw, he died" after CIA-backed rebels beat and sodomized Ghadaffi to death?  Also, did you happen to notice that the attacks fell on 09/11?  These were coordinated attacks against the American Empire that simply used this Muslim movie nonsense to rile up the mob. 




 I just noticed that this article was written by Ron Paul hater James Kirchick.  'Nuff said. 




 **The GOP bent over backwards to accommodate [Ron Paul] at its convention**, airing a 3-minute video tribute in honor of his career (something it did for no other primary contender), included a platform plank calling for an audit of the Federal Reserve (a Paul hobbyhorse), and offered him a speaking slot provided that he endorse Romney - hardly an unreasonable request considering that the event is, after all, a nominating convention.

WTF? 




 You are just dumb. 




 In the hierarchy of evil, consigning someone who has been convicted of nothing to a cage year after year after year, until they die, is high up on the list. And in that regard, this latest episode demonstrates not only the ongoing travesty of the US's war on terror policies, but also the dishonesty of the attempt to exonerate Obama for those policies. 




 ReneFonck is a well-known troll.  Don't feed him. 




 The United States is not at war with Afghanistan for humanitarian reasons.

It is there because Afghanistan borders Iran to the West and China to the East: two countries in the Pentagons sights. And it is there because Afghanistan is a transport route for oil from the stans of the former Soviet Union down to the Arabian Sea. 




 What's the difference? 




 Nice catch.  I didn't notice that. 




 Dempsey also met with Lt. Gen. Robert Caslen, head of the Office of Security Cooperation in Iraq, according to Dempsey's spokesman, Col. David Lapan. **That office is an arm of the U.S. Embassy and is responsible for facilitating Iraqi arms purchases and training the Iraqis how to use and maintain the weapons.** 




 1. Mitt Romney is much less qualified to be president than Ron Paul, who understands the Constitution and Bill of Rights. 




 The reason for the silence about such matters, and the reason commentary of this sort sparks such anger and hostility, is two-fold: first, the US likes to think of terror as something only "others" engage in, not itself, and more so; second, supporters of Barack Obama, the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, simply do not want to think about him as someone who orders attacks on those rescuing his victims or funeral attendees gathered to mourn them.

That, however, is precisely what he is, as this mountain of evidence conclusively establishes.
 




 I'm assuming "other items" is just a euphemism for hookers. 




 Faced with our undeniable momentum and his own failure, the enemy is increasingly forced to resort to spectacular attacks. I am confident that these recent attacks were carefully crafted to drive a wedge between us and our Afghan partners. This is a common theme in the latter stages of a counterinsurgency operation. We saw the same thing in Iraq after the balance had tipped in our favor."

 I don't remember Sarah Palin weeping at her first campaign event. 




 In a June 2011 foreign policy speech, Ryan heralded so-called American Exceptionalism and criticized isolationism, argued that America is the greatest force for human freedom the world has ever seen, leaving out the fact that the US props up dictatorships all around the world and engages in near constant aggression and violence.

 Do you really think it is consistent to say that an industry is privatized when it is "controlled by the federal government?" 




 Your entire comment is nonsensical and uninformed. 




 The trend of privatizing every aspect of American life

This is complete fantasy.  The trend is exactly the opposite (see healthcare, auto industry, mortgage industry, etc.). 




 What are you talking about?  We were about to go to war with the USSR in August of 1945? 




 If nuclear holocaust inflicted upon innocent civilians for the purpose of securing a diplomatic result is not terrorism, then there is no such thing. 




 because I think **we can all agree** that entering WWII and attempting to finish WWII (at whatever cost) was just.

Sorry, there was nothing "just" about WWII (or any other war for that matter).

 




 Whatever else is true, its impossible to evade the fact that Endless War will inevitably degrade the citizenry of the country that engages in it. A country which venerates its military above all other institutions, which demands that its soldiers be spoken of only with religious-like worship, and which continuously indoctrinates its population to believe that endless violence against numerous countries is necessary and just  all by instilling intense fear of the minorities who are the target of that endless violence  will be a country filled with citizens convinced of the virtues and nobility of aggression. 




 resulting in MILLIONS of deaths.

This statistic is a tall tale made up after the war to justify the use of the atomic bomb.  Do me a favor, and read [*The Decision To Use The Atomic Bomb*](http://www.amazon.com/The-Decision-Use-Atomic-Bomb/dp/067976285X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1344430481 sr=8-1 keywords=the+decision+to+use+the+atomic+bomb) by historian Gal Alperovitz.  After doing so, you won't believe all of the lies you were taught in junior high. 




 Yes, of course.  And so should you. 




 You're justifying the mass murder of hundreds of thousands of civilians by citing Ken Burns?  I stand by my original assessment of your character. 




 US pullout

Huh? 




 Telepathy? 




 They're both equally lame. 




 And that makes it morally acceptable to incinerate 300,000 civilians. Wow, what a twisted moral code you must have. 




 If Hiroshima was such an important military target, why hadn't it already been leveled by conventional bombing? 




 Here are some releveant quotes from an [article](http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/phil-strongman-hiroshima-is-a-war-crime-that-haunts-my-family-67-years-on-8008821.html) you should read:  General Eisenhower opposed it, "Japan was already defeated dropping the bomb was completely unnecessary." The Pacific Fleet commander Admiral Nimitz agreed: "The Japanese had, in fact, already sued for peace. The atomic bomb played no decisive part, from a purely military point of view, in their defeat." Admiral Leahy, President Truman's Chief of Staff, concurred: the atomic attacks were "of no material assistance in our war against Japan. The Japanese were already ready to surrender" 




 That's ridiculous. A statement like that tells me that you've never read anything about Hiroshima and are simply regurgitating the mythology you learned in 6th grade.  Hiroshima and Nagasaki were targeted largely b/c there were significant *civilian* populations and b/c they had not been destroyed already w/ conventional bombing.  Military considerations were of little or no importance in the targeting decisions. 




 They were war crimes.  Both of those bombing campaigns deliberately targeted civilians for destruction rather than military forces. 




 Between the two bombs, Harry Truman killed upwards of 300,000 civilians when the war was already won and Japan was attempting to surrender.  If you don't believe me, then see [these quotes](http://www.doug-long.com/quotes.htm) by U.S. military leaders. 




 It wasn't a war crime?  Please explain. 




 Mr. Romney says he wants to increase that to 15 per year, which, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates, would increase the annual budget to $33.5 billion a year, nearly doubling costs over the next 30 years to $1.005 trillion. 




 I wonder who in the CIA wrote this press release for the "rebels?" 




 Marion C. Blakey is president and CEO of the Aerospace Industries Association. 




 So this is supposed to make me so angry with Obama that I'll vote for Romney? 




 I've never claimed to be "patriotic" in the sense you mean: unquestioning support for every action our govt and military take. 




 Why don't you educate me rather than just throwing out a meaningless insult? 




 I'm a keen observer of what happens when a U.S. official, especially the former director of the CIA, issues an ultimatum of this kind.  Just ask Moammar Gadhafi. 




 It sounds to me like the CIA is getting ready to send in the drones. 




 Here's the full quote: "I would say if you want to be able to protect yourself and your family, you better get the hell out now."

So he's basically threatening to kill Assad and his family, right? 




 That's no my interpretion.  It's the intepretation of the [CBS News reporter](https://twitter.com/bkappCBS/status/229954334669017088/photo/1). 




 I wonder how many of Romney's 5 military-aged sons will volunteer to fight in his wars? 




 Takes one to know one... 




 The military has not tortured anyone legally, you are thinking about the CIA.

So, I guess you're saying the CIA is and has always been running Bagram Prison, Gitmo and Abu Ghraib where torture was routine? And, I don't think it was the CIA who tortured the Afghan taxi driver to death in the documentary *[Taxi To The Dark Side](http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/taxi-to-the-dark-side/)*.

President Roosevelt ordered the bombing of Japan

Actually, it was Truman, not the deceased Roosevelt, who ordered the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

Japan (who was far from defeated).

Then I guess you [disagree with Gen. Eisenhower](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower) who said about Truman's decision to drop the bombs:  "I was against it on two counts. **First, the Japanese were ready to surrender**, and it wasn't necessary to hit them with that awful thing. Second, I hated to see our country be the first to use such a weapon."

[Admiral Leahy](http://www.doug-long.com/quotes.htm): "It is my opinion that the use of this barbarous weapon at Hiroshima and Nagasaki was of no material assistance in our war against Japan. **The Japanese were already defeated** and ready to surrender because of the effective sea blockade and the successful bombing with conventional weapons."

[Gen. MacArthur](http://www.doug-long.com/quotes.htm): [MacArthur] replied that he saw **no military justification for the dropping of the bomb**. The war might have ended weeks earlier, he said, if the United States had agreed, as it later did anyway, to the retention of the institution of the emperor."

hatred of the military

I hate pointless mass killing and destruction.  Unfortunately, the U.S. military is an eager participant in both of these activities.  The U.S. military does not protect freedom, it endangers it. If I'm wrong, tell me how I am more free today than I was prior to 9/11 or the Iraq War.
 




 Sorry, but the U.S. military does what most people would consider "abhorrent" things every day.  You routinely attack countries who do not threaten America nor ever could, you've killed literally millions of people in unnecessary foreign conflicts around the globe, you have tortured and continue to torture helpless individuals at secret prisons at the behest of the President, and, to top that off, you dropped city-destroying nuclear bombs on a nation that was already defeated in WWII.  Look at your real history, not the fanciful mythology you've been brainwashed with, and my guess is that a military acting on its own won't seem like such a far-fetched idea.  




 The military would not do it on their own

I guess you have more confidence in the benevolent intentions of our military than I do.  We'll just have to agree to disagree. 




 You do realize the military doesn't attack countries without direction from Obama, right?

You are aware that according to the U.S. Constitution only Congress can declare war, right?
 




 Yeah, right. 




 "It makes no sense to spend money to destroy a facility that you have spent money to build in the first place," said Daud Kalakani, another Afghan lawmaker. 




 Why don't you ask Indonesia or Ethiopia how well off they would be without the US military?

Huh?  I've never heard that our military saved Ethiopia and Indonesia.  You'll have to educate me on that one.

yes we do fight..we do it well.

This just isn't borne out by the facts.  The U.S. military hasn't won a war since WW2.  It lost in Iraq and will lose in Afghanistan.  There is a difference between sowing destruction and death and victory.

criticize the way those liberties are provided

Liberties are natural rights.  Govt doesn't provide liberty.  Govt can only reduce or destroy liberty.

Better men than you or I have died to give you liberty and while criticism is the duty of all in a democracy

U.S. military personnel do not die to preserve liberty or democracy and haven't since (arguably) the American Revolution.  In fact, their actions abroad only serve to reduce liberty and democracy at home (see the TSA and our pointless elections).   They die normally to preserve the financial interests of certain elite groups such as the oil industry or the military-industrial-Congressional complex.  If you don't believe me, then just read [*War is a Racket* by Smedley Butler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_is_a_Racket).
 




 Then again who would save the world after the next disaster or stop some other country from falling apart. 

We *create* disasters (see Iraq, Pakistan, Somalia, Yemen, Afghanistan, etc.), we don't stop them.  The world w/b a much safer place were we to bring our military back to our shores and drastically reduce the size of our forces.

If we didn't have those bases half the world would've fallen apart because we couldn't get to them fast enough.

I don't know which countries you're referring to where we've prevented them from falling apart.  Iraq? Soviet Union? Yugoslavia? Sudan? Mali? Afghanistan? Pakistan? 




 we gave those countries back

We're still there.  They don't have their countries back.  [Ask the people of Okinawa.](http://www.stripes.com/news/protests-greet-arrival-of-controversial-ospreys-in-japan-1.183689)

if we wanted to rule and take over another country there is not 1 country out there who could stop us. 

Actually, Iraq just did exactly that and Afghanistan is in the process of doing so right now. 




 name one country that we have annexed or taken in the last 50 year.

We tried to annex Iraq (remember the 100s of bases George W. Bush wanted?) and we're trying to continue our "enduring presence" in Afghanistan.  We still occupy Guam, Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Japan, Germany, Italy, England, Djibouti and God knows how many other countries.

I have traveled extensively in many countries and have never seen any place where the presence of the U.S. military has had a positive effect.  Of course, nearly every country has benefited from American innovcation and technology, but this would have occured independently from American occupation and bombing.

places where American influence has a been such a good thing

This argument has been used by every imperial power in the last 150 years.  Ignore the trail of destruction, look, they now have basketball courts and flush toilets! Whatever "good" America may have done, is it really worth the piles of corpses we leave behind? 




 Perhaps you're not familiar with the Iraq War and its predecessors.  You may want to check the period from 1990 to the present day. 




 Do you ever think *you* may have been "brainwashed" by either the US govt, the US military or both?  When I read your post, it's almost as if you're describing yourself:

After so much of the same propaganda it becomes reality to them.

America is not some benevolent force spreading its goodness around the world.  The America of today is a brutal, violent imperial force that has sown a field of destruction and death around the globe for decades.  This is why they hate us. 




 Did you ever ask **why** those Saudis attacked the US?  Do you think it may have been b/c the US military had bases in their country and was using them to incessantly bomb Iraq?  Or, did they attack America b/c we have R rated movies and listen to Brittany Spears (i.e., 'They hate us for our freedom'), as George W. Bush postulated? 




 He killed a million people.  Is that one of the "bad breaks" you're referring to? 




 Check out the comment by "Keith_Vlasak". 




 I guess in a world where war means peace and freedom means slavery, then yes, George W. Bush is a "moral voice" who reflected the "decency" of most Americans. 




 Sorry for posting, but it's instructive to know how these people think. 




 supporting the Libyan rebels

My guess is that the U.S. pilots who bombed Libya and killed Libyans may be eligible for the award as well.  What do you think? 




 but as president he has to continue the business that is part of being the president 

You mean killing people who have never threatened our country nor ever could? 




 The Afghan Surge was ordered by Obama, not the Monster Bush.  The drone strikes in Pakistan have overwhelmingly been ordered by Obama, not the Monster Bush.  If you are unaware of this, please consult the Internet. 




 See, Obama says he's against massacring people, but one day after saying so, he kills more people than the Batman theater killer.  Get it? 




 Well, I guess this op-ed makes up for the million people he killed in Iraq. 




 Just wait until someone suddenly discovers that Al-Qaeda is using Namibia as a terrorist sanctuary.  




 At a dinner co-hosted by the governor and the congresswoman, Deputy Secretary Carter congratulated the people of Guam on the 68th anniversary of their Liberation Day.

 Didn't Rand just give up on his own father?

 That'll definitely make me vote for Romney. /s 




 I thought we were fighting them over there so we didn't have to fight them here? 




 Paul on Tuesday agreed with that advice, saying Romneys tax returns have become too much of a distraction.

Its a shame. The important issue is [what] the two candidates seem to agree on. They dont really disagree with militarism overseas, they dont disagree with the Federal Reserve system and the bailouts, and they dont disagree on basically whether the role of federal government is wealth redistribution through welfare. So instead, theyre talking about tax returns and that to me is so disappointing, he said. Its all a charade, I think its all contrived to not have a debate. 




 Mitt Romneys father was placed in nomination for president in 1964 and 1968 despite having no chance to win either time. Romneys father refused to endorse the 1964 nominee before or after the convention. 




 Romney came to Aspen between resort fundraising stops in the Hamptons and Jackson Hole. 




 This isn't a base and it isn't for us.

Oh to be naive again... 




 They seem to be doing a pretty good job against every branch of the U.S. military. 




 Yes, I'm sure there will be no U.S. military personnel within the confines of the Afghan intelligence building. 




 Didn't we elect a new president a few years ago?  Or, is George W. Bush still president? 




 Read your own post.  Of us two, who exactly is the "mindless hater?" 




 Yes, I dislike the fact that our president kills innocent people virtually every day.  And so should you. 




 The ones who wanted to learn some basic economics, perhaps?

 I wonder how many military suicides there would be if Obama ended his wars... 




 Rand wants to eliminate tax "loopholes."  This is the equivalent of raising taxes and Ron Paul has said as much.

Rand wants more *govt* spending on infrastructure.  This is exactly what Obama advocated when rallying support for his $800 billion "stimulus" program.  And nowhere in the interview does Rand ever state that he wants to *decrease* govt spending of any kind.  Ron always brings up reducing spending, particularly overseas.

Rand wants to make sure the behemoth and unconstitutional govt programs Social Security and Medicare are around for another 75 years.  Whenever Ron is asked about these programs, he always states that we need to transition out of them, not keep them around for another century.

And BTW, no one likes a tattletale.

 




 One last thing is worth mentioning from the documents published today:  Anyone with any doubt that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is dangerous to the United States is contradicting U.S. intelligence. **Violence between Israelis and the Palestinians, moreover is making Sunni extremists more willing to participate in attacks against US or Israeli interests, the CIA wrote in February 2001**. It is not the only piece of information revealed by the new documents that will be deeply uncomfortable for the Bush administration and hawks across the country. 




 "These deaths are grim reminders that our Military...is still in active combat **in defense of our country**. We are privileged to have such heroes in our midst," [said Maj. Gen. Robert E.

 From the comments: "I think that being friendly toward Rand Paul and (to some degree) inviting him 'inside the tent' is absolutely the smartest thing Romney's advisers have done since Romney has become the presumptive nominee. **Kudos to** them for this, and to **Rand Paul for being a team player."** 




 But, The Surge worked?  Right? 




 From the story pic, looks like RP's going full-on tribal for the Tampa fest. 




 Great comment.  Thanks.

 "You can find condoms in Haiti," Moscou said, "but many people can't afford them, and supplies run out. People now understand that you need to use them." 




 I agree.  It sounds like the Jack Hunter argument. 




 Whatever else is true, having the military held in such higher esteem than all other American institutions is an obviously dangerous state of affairs for a democracy.  




 So Ron Paul supporters are not "principled?"  This coming from a self-described "team player?" 




 Rands endorsement of GOP nominee Mitt Romney clearly shows that in spite of those who try to marginalize him, he has keen set of political instincts and is very much aware that a successful national run will require more than just his fathers loyal following, said one Republican strategist close to Paul-world.

Wanna bet this quote is from Jesse Benton? 




 Rand Paul in a single stroke has made credible all the things that his father's supporters suspected of him: He's a conservative politician first, someone who has gone into politics to serve his own interests.

 It's not. 




 How has spending billions on our military "prevented" or "won" wars?  We've been at war constantly since WWII and haven't won a single war since then either. 




 Yes, the deaths millions of people around the globe were definitely worth getting American women in the workplace.  Sorry, I forgot about that one. 




 You mean the war where Harry Truman dropped nuclear bombs to intentionally destroy entire cities and their civilian populations?  Yeah, Americans should be real proud of that atrocity.

I'm assuming you're joking about Kosovo so I won't address that one. 




 But people do take you seriously, right? 




 Name a good one. 




 This all has to do with a policy led by a president who does not believe in American exceptionalism, McCain said.

 That is the imperial mind at work. Its premises are often embraced implicitly rather than knowingly: American lives are inherently more valuable; foreign lives are expendable in pursuit of American interests; the U.S. has the inalienable right to take action in other countries that nobody is allowed to take in the U.S.  




 It won't work.

 I'm glad you agree. 




 "Credit" for what?  Killing people? 




 The Museum of Modern Art in New York arranged for a public premiere in June 1946, but minutes before the show, two military policemen confiscated the print. 




 The Afghan army has been given billions of dollars worth of American training and weaponry over the past decade; yet we're told that only 1 percent of these forces are now capable of undertaking operations on their own. But the opponents of the occupation -- without these billions, without a bristling international military alliance behind them -- have somehow managed to wield a military force that grows more effective with each passing year. 




 Unsurprisingly, then, when I asked Paul supporters whether they would be voting for Romney this year, every single one of them said definitely not, and they insisted other Paul supporters they know wouldnt either. 




 7 "suspects", 8 civilians. 




 I wonder if any Afghans will be included in these negotiations.

 Best analysis so far from the Christian Science Monitor: **[Why Ron Paul's 2012 effort may not really be over](http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/DC-Decoder/Decoder-Wire/2012/0514/Why-Ron-Paul-s-2012-effort-may-not-really-be-over)** - The Ron Paul campaign won't run ads in upcoming primaries, but Paul is still out to make his mark at the GOP's August convention. That means getting supporters elected as delegates and even picking up some 'stealth' delegates. 




 Fair enough. 




 This story has other "useful information [and] anaylsis."  It should not be consolidated under the official campaign announcement. 




 I like how the writer had to add this hearsay to the story:
