 The same goes with video games? Do you play them in chronological order or when they were made? Example:Kingdom Hearts or Metroid?  




 For example Star Wars. Do you watch New hope, Empire, Return and then the prequels? Or prequels first?  




 One of my favorites is "graffiti is for fags"  




 Graffiti found in the bathroom stalls or on the walls.  




 Reminds me of the Facebook girl meme.
