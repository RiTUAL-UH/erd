 That's not a problem with the disorderly conduct law; that is a problem with the police illegally applying the law. They had no cause to arrest these people nor many others that they do the same thing to. Unfortunately, the NYPD will rarely ever punish them but any citizen that does suffer this unconstitutional treatment can sue the NYPD and the city. There is also the Civilian Complaint Review Board and the Internal Affairs Bureau (both of which are usually useless). I recommend suing as your best bet.

I'd like to say that I don't see abuses of power often but that would be a lie. Almost every day I am court I see some level of abuse of power. It can range from outright lying on the stand to searching someone without cause. And for the record there is no law against dancing per se. 




 Okay this is a little tough to explain. Everyone in the justice system knows that disorderly conduct is a completely bullshit law. These people's charges were dismissed and based on the info provided in the article probably by the prosecutor before they even saw the judge. Most of the time in NYC if you are charged with only disorderly conduct the charges will be dismissed or you can receive an ACD (adjournment in contemplation of dismissal). An ACD means that if you do not get in trouble again for 6 months the charges are dismissed and sealed. 

Disorderly conduct has been challenged multiple times as unconstitutional but the courts have consistently upheld its validity. It is written in such a way that it does not violate the first amendment, according to the courts. 

As a defense attorney I am not so sure I want this statute to disappear. The reason for that is because it is only considered a violation which is not a crime under NY law. Often times when prosecutors can't or won't dismiss a bad case they will offer the disorderly conduct plea even when disorderly conduct has nothing to do with the original charges. Or sometimes they offer it even in a good case if there is a reason they feel the defendant does not deserve the punishment he or she is possibly facing. This plea allows your client to avoid a criminal record and avoid risking losing at trial. Some defense attorney are a little too willing to have their clients take these pleas but I can definitely say that there are times it is overwhelmingly beneficial for my client to take it.

I'd be happy to answer any questions I can about it.  




 It seems they were arrested for disorderly conduct, [New York Penal Law 240.20(5)](http://law.onecle.com/new-york/penal/PEN0240.20_240.20.html) . The NYPD does this all the time. The only difference here is that instead of young black or Hispanic males it was a middle aged white couple. 




 Well played sir. lol

 There isn't a plaintiff in any criminal case. 




 Las Vegas? 




 There is [Pacer](http://www.pacer.gov/) but I am pretty sure that a case that old won't be on Pacer but you can request case information from the court [Document Retrieval](http://www.mad.uscourts.gov/caseinfo/records-search.htm)  




 He really lived up to the stereotype too: "Haines never returned to film and instead started a successful interior design business with his life partner and was supported by friends in Hollywood."

 I am much more disturbed by the other two incidents than this one. This one seems to be set off by a non race related reason: "he was stopped by U.S. border patrol agents after residual radiation from a medical procedure hed recently undergone triggered an alarm at a checkpoint" 




 I'm not sure if you are joking but I don't think that's her in the picture. It looks like a mannequin.

 Fun fact: The Tom's Diner Suzanne Vega named the song after is the same diner that Seinfeld used for the outside of Monk's Cafe. And it is actually called Tom's Restaurant. It's on the corner of 112th and Broadway.
