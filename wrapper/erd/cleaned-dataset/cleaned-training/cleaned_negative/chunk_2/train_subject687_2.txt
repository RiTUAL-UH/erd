 This brightened my day up... I hope it happens for real. 




 lol... this actually made my day a bit better. 









 Yeah, in some areas, the blood reached above my ankle... it was so amazing. 




 /r/april30th2015 ... people are unsubscribing... 




            !!!!! 




 lol 




            !!!!! 









 Wow... I didn't know it actually happened in real life! 




 It's like the opposite of a buy. You make money when the stock goes down, and lose when it goes up. 




 Thanks 




 He'll come back soon :) 




 In bed! {:D 
























 ERROR 




 It's an honor. 









 Yeah.... I can only hope someone trolls the troll :) 




 Great news... I probably won't have to delete it :) My situation isn't as bad as I thought. 




 I'm a victim 




 Usually trolls don't work successfully on me... most trolls can't succeed, and I often figure out how to turn the troll on them. But today one did... ooooo the anger... how it burns! 




 What does he do to people? Isn't that illegal? Is he coming after us now for talking about him? 




 I was wrong :( 




 Ok

 A858 









 I think that's why she stopped posting... *she found out.* 




 YEEEehh heh heh heh {:-D 




 Well, it certainly wasn't a bad thing. I guess my posts just weren't funny enough, or a mod hated me.... I really don't care though, I mean, there are many more funny subreddits out there like /r/jokes and /r/humor which give good karma :) 




 I'm not sure... though it might be. 




 Ooops, My bad... 




 Ouch... 



















 I bet it's just one cute innocent-minded girl encoding her thoughts ;-) 




 That water is crystal clean :) 














 What if A858 is a girl? 




 DOOT DOOT.... A858 is actually a girl... I believe. 




 DOOT DOOT 




 Oh no... it'll be much worse, my friend. 




 :) 




 lol... it's a fake tear ;-) 




 I will :) 




 Is it you? 




 OH GOD! MY SKIN! WHERE DID IT GO!!?? {:'-D 




 He actually saved the whole world. Believe it or not, the fact that he was sent back in time changed history. Thanks to his time travel, Earth rotated 42 milliseconds faster on it's axis while he was here, thus preventing the tip of the solar emission from hitting Earth. According to calculations, had 20141220 not traveled back in time, Earth would not have rotated faster, and at the time of the solar storm, the tip would have hit Earth, taking all the lights out. Therefore, this was not all a lie. The truth is.... we have been saved. 












































 I'll be honest.... I kind of believed there was a possibility for the lights to go out, though I doubted it would be as severe as described. And yes, part of me wanted this big change. But oh well, there's both good and bad about the lights not going out.


Good: I won't have to suffer a slow and tortourous death

Bad: Life stays the same



Overall, I must say this was a good experience. It was very smartly played, as very few people can actually get me to fall for believing something like this. Consider this: I didn't even believe the world would end back in December 2012! Yet, part of me believed the lights would go out now in 2015.



Well, I guess things resume back to normal.... and I'll be able to create my **Space-Pizza Subreddit**! :)

**EDIT:** I'm currently about 3 hours too early... oops, apologies :/ 









 It's obviously impossible... skeletons are *in* us. Without them, we would all be a blob of flesh and muscle on the floor unable to stand up or move. Skeletons are not a threat to humans. 




 Can someone please explain to me the situation here? 





























 I've got nothing more to say.

 Hi, I was wondering if anyone knew how to position that box(all the way at the bottom of subreddits) to be in the center? On my subreddit it's to the left, but I would like it to be in the center. I actually have never taken any CSS class before and only get my styles by editting others' stylesheets, so I am inexperienced. My subreddit is named /r/CrazyCows . Thanks in advance for the help.  



















 The Praxis of My Method, underscored by all necessary humilities and good graces.
Let's jump right into it and grab as many electron rings as we slide down the pipeline of letters, doers, willers, thinkers, feelers, wishers, commanders and demanders...
The state of mastership is to be at all times consciously and positively in receptive and gracious attitude. Open to all good and positive powers to flow through you is a paramount condition, and to direct them in the proper channles of good thoughts, words and deeds the further fruitage of the tree of eternity (the fully restored cosmic ego).
All around us, at all times, are the titanic forces of the entire universe, unique in our present positions, which seek forever to enter into and transmute you and themselves according to laws which can be discovered and harnessed for the good purposes of uplifting the estate of life and sustaining the vitality of being. These transmissions from the infinity expanse of complex diverse forms and minds encounter no resistance when in proper channels from the Master/Mistress of their own Destiny. To find the hidden music of the moment is to establish the master rhythm with the body and from the body back to the world. It relinquishes the dependency on the fetal impressions of the mother and the world at time of conception, pregnancy and delivery (the first causes of all subsequent causal reactions and responses) as well as memory dependence on negative and adverse surroundings, coincidences and influences. This establishment of the master rhythm was accomplished in a variety of elementary procedures in the ancient schools, be they Hebrew baptism, the Babylonian-Dravidian heat tests, the Egyptian endurance tests, or even the somewhat less known tradition of live burial for purposes of feeling the earth itself in full exposure to the earth itself, vaguely popular amongst certain lesser known mystery cults.
Only those who can read this and already understand the value of it without having to do it will be sufficiently advanced to proceed with deeper lessons. Atavistic remonstrance is worth it's weight in immediate experience. Don't re-invent the wheel itself.
In the Great Work of Mastery, the main and the only object is to attain communion with the harmonious creative power of the world and consciously joining the forces for solving the destinies of the Evolution towards Immortal Oneness.
The first steps along this infinite journey involve a mastery of thoughts and through the thoughts a mastering of the body; the dynamic so established releases hidden potentials through the energetic activation of previously energy-starved processes.
Many definitions of mastery exist: to overpower, to subdue, to rule, to possess dominion, superiority and victory of beings conscious of it.
Consider further that man is generally in a state of slavery of one sort or another. Everywhere you look you see people in one state of involuntary bondage after another, and all of them creating more chains to bind those who are not bound like themselves.
This slavery is produced by ignorance on any of the planes of manifestation (the short list being physical, emotional, intellectual and psychic) and any combination there of. Ignorance is imbalance at best, and many other horrible things at worst.
Competition amongst the slaves of the world for the supposed benefits of further bondage has resulted in an almost penal atmosphere, wherein every breath brings anxiety and fear, and thus agitates and depletes the reserves of energy for the body and the mind to function as a healthy union of the forces.
This condition, of pandemic psychosocial slavery is one that must be overpowered, must be subdued, has to have a ruling decision made over it, and be possessed by the dominion of a new system, superior and victorious for Man and the Forces alike, to bring about the revitalizing and vast expansion of expressions of each, to sustain the world and even turn deserts into paradise.
And towards a paradise on Earth one has lent the ears that heard that the words mystic, occult and magick get thrown around pretty commonly today, and so I wanted to recapitulate how I am wont to believe them to mean.
Mysticism is born from careful observation of impressions through supersensitive channels, both biological, psychological and technological. It can be a state of mind alone, but it is also the observation of that state of mind in the midst of being it.
Occultism thus becomes the correct interpretation of that which can't be seen at the same time what is seen is also interpreted as the effects, causes, or side-effects of the invisible properties and objects of the world. It is engaged through a soulful conscious discrimination between assembling data.
Magick must follow suite and make manifest the practical application of mysticism and occultism; the powers of creation, destruction and transmutation in action at the behest of a will possessed of self-solidarity and worldliness to make things happen or not happen according the truth the magician holds at heart.
Yes, so in measure the mother of invention herself embraces those moments when her offspring manifest the 3 overmentalities. In a word or thrice spoken lesser worlds, finding no other solution to the problem of YOU, decided to feed yourself back to yourself and make you even more YOU, which solved two problems with one philosophy's stone. You couldn't escape yourself, and the world learned all about you while containing you completely in a binding of self-other-self-grammar.
The attempts of the limp world to contain you only fail because it is now seen as a foreign taste which now has to get you to like it too, and you only will if the world becomes you itself, which it will make small concessions too, and progressively, if conditions are correct your central sphere of influence will now have a probability-spreading shell of orbiting factors that serve you because they became you, and being you can't speak to you in anything other than your own voice, so they are themselves mute, and you face the second entrapment.
The breakdown of those orbiting elements in their exposure to an external world that is now less familiar with your ultimate self, is slowly becoming familiar with your extant orbiting self-satellites, and since the world still has to trap you and them it binds them in the same procedure it used to bind you in the beginning. Take heart, the world CANNOT learn, it can only grow and repeat.
Thus you reach the third extension, and the snapping of the leash, that of the world's reflexes becoming your own, and now you can interact with the world through decaying aspects of your own history and new aspects of your present and future, safely for the first time, because now the world can only see itself in you.
Fortunately you think now of an "orange" and the taste of it, and the funny architecture of it, and remember all the arrangements of situations that presented the orange to you, and foresee all the memories of the orange as it is. New tones enter your life and your satellites learn new forms of communication and the amount of acquired information about your universe expands exponentially, taking you to a new level, wherein you become self sustaining in a way that the world no longer can effect.
Thus you have attained a harmonized consciousness. Eternal satisfactions are not yet too far ahead. 




 Is this subreddit dead and abandoned? 







































 THE OUTER MARKER"


WILL YOU PLEASE REPEAT."
"771 PLEASE SAY AGAIN. "



 
































































 Just imagine.... no more communication(well, cell phones only last until their battery lasts), no more reddit, no running water, no school, no lights at night(oooo spooky :P), etc.

EDIT: This horror lasts for over 5 years. 









 I heard it's the sea-floor of reddit... is that true? 



















 Alright, here's my personal conflict with the horrid SAT. It basically ruined my image.... both to colleges and classmates. I got rejected from most colleges, despite my 4.0 GPA(weighted)/3.8(unweighted).... just because of that stupid SAT score. My classmates made fun of me too. The day of the test, I was very sick and it resulted in a very low score despite having taken(and **wasted over $1000** on SAT prep) 2 SAT prep courses, wasted 2 summers studying hard, and sacrificing regular school studying. All the hard work just to be ruined by this one day.
