 What is the french police force trained exclusively on call of duty? "we should equip our sharpshooters with submachine guns" makes sense... 




 Check your local walmart. Mine has boxes of 30 for $9.97.
ZQ SS109 62gr. FMJ for  $0.30 a round. Don't help the gougers out anymore.

 Sorry for the disregard, everyone, stopped at the local hardware store and picked up 3 different o-ring sizes (don't ask me which, i just eyeballed them off the wall basically). Slipped the largest one i got on there nice and tight and, what do you know, slop gone. Thanks for saving me the $35 folks.
