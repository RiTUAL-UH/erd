 This.  Even that bigfoot show, people tune in just to see if they spot the bigfoot.  I mean come on!  If they did it would be on the news, they wouldn't wait for it to air on the show! 




 Wait in line to make sure you're first buying a ticket, let a pretty person go in front of you. Buy all the rest of the tickets. A date without having to ask!



*im sorry* 









 Me at every bar:   It's all downhill and I usually take rail.

 I have no hands 




 Yes they do.  I was in Mexico and I asked for ketchup and got horse radish  




 Any interesting scripts you read in awhile that were completely idiotic? 




 What part?   Cities? Duluth are? Iron range?

It was hailing today!

 I will go on Craigslist in certain cities where a friend resides.  I go to the "missed connections" and post a pretty detailed description in hopes that friend will come across it.   It has only worked twice and when they respond to the email I tell them it's me.

 I bet the conversation went like this:

Her: Hey Brad we rescued some kittens from a disaster.  They are so cute!  I sent you a pic.

You:  Oh it looks adorable!  *This will not get any karma tho*  Can you send another one?  

Her: Sure!  

You:  *Fuck it's blurry and not that cute looking*  Can you send another?

Her:  Ya?  Here's me holding one. 

You: *Fuck ya*  Thanks!

 Hate to break it to ya man, I knew I saw her somewhere else.  She even talks about being a model when she was younger in the thread. [http://www.reddit.com/r/gonewild/comments/yladd/first_time_poster_do_you_like_magic/](http://holidaygifgiver.com/media/images/gifs/450/450_original.gif) 




 Wow, I grew up in a house which was in the country.  I would walk to a field and just hang out all day.   Just using my imagination and being whoever I wanted out there.   Seeing this picture, completely made me smile.   I'm going through a rough time right now and you just made me feel normal.   Thank you.  




 Yes, This would be a Spider's Paradise.    














 *Boing!* 




 Aww ya!  Snack time!


I'm Jk ha.  Sorry  




 Everyone these are not mine!   They are someone's from my newsfeed!   Everyone has been telling him to put up more.   It seems he only post them to Facebook.   

I agree they do need better quality shots.   I just wanted people to see some unappreciated talent

 From the thumbnail I thought i was some little guy standing on his hind legs with buggy eyes.    




 Just ordered the liquid cocaine shot and..wow that should get me ready for the night  









 Alright Reddit, I'm heading downtown now to go bar hopping.   I will be alone for the most part.  I want you to give me drink ideas!  Something that you like or I should try.   I will order and try each one and report back with brief opinion on each drink.   


 




 Mine likes to snag the couch spot whenever I get up.  http://imgur.com/zeVFT 




 They are so cute!  I bet you could fit at least 11 in your wallet! 




 I live in MN and every car you purchase comes with this sticker. 




 Gizmo! 




 Come on now... Nobody accepts American Express. 




 Sometimes I will buy a pack of smokes for the weekend if I know Im going to be drinking.   I don't smoke otherwise.   Anyway last Saturday night my friends and I were outside a bar having a cig and a homeless guy walked up to us and asked for a cig.  My friends kinda ignored him and I just flat out offered him my pack with the lighter.   He started tearing up and he thanked me as if I saved him from his poverty life.  It gave me such a weird feeling overall.  I mean those won't help him in life, but even hurt him more.   It just confused me.  :( I hope he's ok.     









 It reminds me of my ex. 




 It is a parody everyone.  Nevermind, faith restored in Jack Black! 









 you r fukd 




 I bet that was so gratifying when you pulled the ends and you got that slight suction feeling.   




 My roommate has a pet ferret.  We would do "ferret bombs" where you would run up to someone lying on the couch with the ferret and stick it under their shirt or up their pant leg.  Next you would grab a squeeek toy and squeeze the shit out of it making that god awful noise.   This would drive the ferret crazy which would lead to biting and burrowing.   Man I can't wait for school start again :/ 




 **TITLE CLEARLY DOES NOT SAY "IT ALL"** 









 [Mine ended quite fast](http://imgur.com/GHGs8) 




 There is 2.5 servings in that bottle.  Now if you look at the table below it's broken down to 8 fl oz and per Bottle.  So at 8 fl oz there is 0 calories, but somehow at Per bottle there is now 5 calories?  Basically  0 x 2.5 = 5  




 I actually broke one open at my grandmas when I was little.  Played with the stuff for about an hour.   It was amazing.   Grandma flipped the fuck out tho! 




 [They already did](http://i.imgur.com/FTdA6.jpg)

 Holy shit do I feel embarrassed for him.  Def not the right move.  We get the apology, but be a fkn man.  Just stop being an asshole and everything will go back to normal. 




 Every time I hear 1 million moms I think it's some awesome porno I somehow missed in my life.   So this idea needs to come true. 




 He will def be getting a hand job by the end of july and bjs by the end of august. 




 So you can't take out a helicopter like that...

 Going to ride off cardstocks comment:

First off, front page wow.  Second, my younger sister is 18.  So, if you are surprised she knows what a blunt is well shes...18.  Third,  I would still jam that whole thing in my mouth.  :D  

P.s.  She likes reading the comments and she said haters gonna hate. 




 She set it on a blanket.   I dunno why she did that, but I would still eat it.
