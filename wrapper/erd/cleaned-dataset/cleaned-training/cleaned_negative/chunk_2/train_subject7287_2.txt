 There is this girl and every time I see her it feels like my heart is about to fly out of my chest. Is this love or just infatuation?  




 You tried so hard to be right. You're wrong though, dead wrong. 




 Good luck man, sounds like fun. 




 I'll definitely look into that. Thanks for the advice 




 Thanks. What did you major in if you don't mind me asking?
