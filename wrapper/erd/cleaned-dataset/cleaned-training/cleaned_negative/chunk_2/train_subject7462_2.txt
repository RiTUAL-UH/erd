METEOR OUTBURST: Radars in Canada are reporting a major outburst of Draconid meteors commencing at 16 UT on Oct. 8th. "Radar rates are at 1000 meteors per hour," says Bill Cooke of NASA' Meteoroid Environment Office. "This is greater than last year's outburst, and 5x the 2005 level." 

Cooke encourages northern sky watchers, especially in Europe where night is falling, to be alert for Draconid activity.  Because radars are sensitive to very small meteoroids, there is no guarantee that this radar outburst will translate into meteors visible to the human eye.  On the other hand, a brilliant display could be in progress.  The only way to know is to go outside and look.  Check http://spaceweather.com for more information and updates.

 I feel your pain.   Four years ago I came down with a case of shingles on my face.  This is one of more unpleasant diseases. Shingles is what us cantankerous old farts get when we get overstressed.  The  other prerequisite is that you must have had chicken pox as a kid.  Who hasn't?  It started out as a vague toothache so I  went to a dentist first and he missed it. Prescribed me painkillers and antibiotic. Next came jaw ache, ear ache, head ache, you name them. Then sores started to break out on my face and tongue. Went to a walk in clinic next day and the totally disinterested doctor on duty missed to.  More pain killers and cream.  Went to the emergency the next day and the admitting nurse took one look at me and told me what I got.  Got a prescription for antiviral med and appointment with ophthalmologist.  Next day I developed double vision. Back to emergency.  Seven hours later after a blood test and a cat scan it was confirmed that both neurons are functioning.  Another visit
to ophthalmologist confirmed that one of the eye steering muscles / nerves is affected.  This will settle down eventually.  If the stupid dentist diagnosed
me properly I would be ok by now.  Instead I have to put up with this for
weeks, maybe months. Guys,  if you ever had chicken pox get familiar with
symptoms of shingles (herpes zoster).  If caught early the treatment is more
effective. My double vision persisted for six months.  Feeling that someone slammed me with a bag full of door knobs comes and goes.
