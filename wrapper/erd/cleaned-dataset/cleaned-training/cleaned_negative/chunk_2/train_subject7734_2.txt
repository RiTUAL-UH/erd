 Of course this isn't across the board but it seems in English speaking groups and some closely related it is impossible to notice. 




 That was one of my worst fears before hand. I didn't have a drink the first 2 days. Since then over 2 weeks I have tied one on about 5 times. That means about 12-18 beers each night. I still haven't given in which blows my mind. I thought it was impossible. I honestly think I am just finally fucking done with these things. It feels great.

How has it been for you?

 









 Thanks for reading. I know this isn't mind blowing or some great story but I am glad this sub exists so I am able to get it off my chest to some people who it means something to. 
























 side note. What is myspace now? A wall of instructions? 




 The only side effect I have come across so far is being a bit spaced out and super super vivid dreams. No nightmares just super realistic mundane everyday shit with all of the people I know and in all the places I know them. Every night since my first day of being a non-smoker I have smoked in my dreams. Yet, in my dream I knew it was wrong and it was not good. I have woken up each morning thinking I had cheated. 

So far chantix has helped me deal with what I could not. Cravings. Now it's all mental. I have an argument with myself about 20 times daily. It's usually me trying to convince myself to just have one after a trigger. Not happening. I am able to get past that withing 5 minutes. I started carrying around those [plastic floss sticks](http://img.dxcdn.com/productimages/sku_47578_2.jpg). They are a great way to get the oral fixation out of the way and keep my teeth clean.

I have smoked since I was 14. I am just about to turn 35. The past ten years I was up to a 1.5-2.5 a day depending on circumstances. I feels so strong that I am on day 4 and am actually proud of myself for once in many many years. 

Thank you for reading my quick rant. 









 Oh, and no variations on any others.  









 The main thing I am anxious about is what it's like to have that last cigarette on Tuesday night.  










































































 Alfonso on blow is not somebody I would want to run into.  



















 I sure hope that I can. 














 I even tried taking them with two different cameras. I also tried uploading separate older pics on my laptop and they work but these wont. Anyone else experience this? 


































 Anything goes...except child support and menthol cigarettes.

Creative is always good, but not needed. You got a phone bill or car insurance bill that is behind? Maybe you want to see a concert/show and can't swing it right now (thanks josh) let me know. 

Don't be ashamed to ask for help, okay?

Edit: One electric bill shut off notice and one swedish drinker taken care of. Cheers guys. I love all of you fucking booze faces.

I see that the specs seem to be pretty much okay but I am worried about build quality. I really like the way my xps has a flat screen as opposed to one of those edged screens. 

Thank you for any assistance. 









 I know everything in this world serves a purpose...but come on. Ticks too. 




 Can you give me any spots I should check out?  




 Can you give me any spots to check out? I have nothing but time and don't mind a good drive. Thank you.  

















































 Such as, "Hey, can you go grab the water strainer" or "I need you to finely dice this pound of flour" or "go get the bacon stretcher"

Lets hear your best. 














 Have you been utilizing it or did you hide it and have since forgotten about it?  




 I own a pompano 120 if that helps. 




 I am yet to join an event only because they seem so rigid. 
































































 They cost more to make than they are worth, right?  



















 Lets all try and figure it out. 





























 Looking for a few people to join. I am the Chester area. 

 


































 Yesterday I finally caught a large mouth while out on my kayak. I ran into a guy on his bass boat and we got to talking. I was dragging a worm across the bottom by the weeds and my freaking pole went nuts. 

When I finally got him about 10 feet from my kayak he took my pole about a foot into the water. The guy who is an avid bass fisherman was actually amped/ "Holy shit dude that a biggy"

This fish finally came up and jumped over the tip of my kayak. Coolest looking thing. It was such a rush. 

Sadly I was not able to get a picture and as I was pulling it up next to me it got loose. :( The dude on the boat said it was probably a 6-7 pounder.

I know to most of you this is old news in a bucket but for me it was like christmas morning. 

Anyway I just wanted to tell my tale of it. 




 It's some new show on NBC and I figured you guys would like to know. Now, drink your piss. 




 Anyone down for a quick trip tomorrow at around 6pm at Seldens? 














 I wont mention any bands myself as to not make this a circle jerk of taste in music. Have you ever dealt with this? Do you constantly deal with this?  




 Well, I plugged the sucker in and windows couldn't find the driver. I am using a windows 7 64 bit laptop. So, I went and found the driver(s). The first one installed just fine but the second one (legacy software download) didnt. It said a a time out error. Anyway I go and download audacity because I have fiddled with it over the years and know it is a really stripped down program that some buddies of mine would use when we would write songs. Now I am able to choose the audiobox from the output/speaker menu in Audacity but it is nowhere in the input/mic menu. Does this make any sense to any of you? I am sorry for putting this in the regular askreddit sub but if any of you know a really specific sub for this please let me know and I will move it over there. I am just dying to get some of these songs down on (tape?)

 I will be bringing my kayak and fishing gear for the lake t the campground. Any tips etc? Am I able to get a fishing pass/license for a day or two or do I need to get a full license?  
























 My backyard leads directly into a state forest and there are many stone wall property barriers strewn about.  









 Gear can really ring up after a bit when I'm at the local shop. I love supporting them, but I would love to find a good site that can give me a break here and there. 





























 Does that make sense? I've seen it down before. 




 My girlfriend has seats right behind home plate and I want to see how awesome her seats are. I don't get it with my basic cable package. Any ideas? I am having no luck. I went to the nesn website but I can't figure out if the streaming is actually live or not...or if they will even be showing the game. 
























 I will work out the tangles, okay? 

















































 I just got into it last year and I am looking forward to this season. Anyone out there wanna join me and a buddy tomorrow? It's a long shot but I would love some tips on bait, lures and techniques.  




 I am a recreational kayaker/angler and would love to meet up with some of you for this upcoming season. I created a subreddit @ [r/connecticutkayakers](http://www.reddit.com/r/connecticutkayakers/) for us to plan trips, give location pointers and share pictures/videos. I personally am going to be out for the the next few days after work and this weekend is shaping up to be great. 




 I have been revisiting my youth and honestly it started with listening to the Kids Soundtrack again after almost 20 years. Yes, Dinosaur Junior and KRecords. What else you guys got? 









 I am planning on asking for a raise and would like to be able to use this as some reference. 

















































 Please. 

















































 It's a simple return. Just one w-2 


































 Yah, so? 
























 Yep, spring is ruined.  




 Anyone know what thread it came from? 




 I'll grab some beers and my fishing gear and snag some trout on a big lake. Who's in? 
























 Has anyone heard them yet this year? Was tonight the turning point? I am just waiting for the freaking hornets to start crawling out and messing my entire day up.
