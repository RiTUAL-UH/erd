 Back in the day, one of the williams sisters said that they could take on any male in a game of tennis.  The world ranked #200 male took the challenge and won easily.

 every car is black/white/grey.

We had to look forEVER to find the right car that wasn't black/white/silver.  Like a year or more (used car).

Here's a cool time lapse of cars in San Diego where they are all separated into color. http://vimeo.com/82038912 look at how many white/grey/black cars then count the rest of them.

There's like 2-3 seconds of blue and one pure yellow (sentra on the top) and one orange (WRX). 




 [not that rare](http://i.imgur.com/sAsSfgh.jpg) I love mine, get compliments all the time.

What I never see are sport coupes.

 I added a 500w amp and one 10" sub and it's fine. 




 They might make a case if something that is directly connected to the mod if it goes wrong. Like the maf, or the o2 sensor goes out with a intake and exhaust mod.  




 Maybe add a little more fluid abd check the level of your pads. 




 It's got a hole in the top for one but I've not seen anything that goes in it. Our unit makes smoothies like a champ.  It's the only button we use 




 I think it refers to when you are walking down the sidewalk and you are on the "outside" of the two of you, closer to the street.  This is more dangerous for you and safer for her.

[Exhaust vs stock on a 370z](http://370zexhaust.com/370z-stillen-exhaust-dyno.jpg) 




 Well, they have individual dyno readings of 19hp from the exhaust and about 15hp from the intake.  I've not seen a unit that has a dyno of both (and only both) vs stock.

It's seems far fetched, but they have some data to back it up. 




 P85D, D means dual motor.  so it's AWD with launch assist so it doesn't blindly put the power where it doesn't need it. 




 That's why they need to get the hydrogen fuel cell's working at this level.  You can just pump more hydrogen into it to generate more electricity and have a long range, fast refill and just as powerful of a car.

 they usually are trying to smash it in to some other moving thing which is tough.

If all you are doing is smashing it in to a wall...that's much easier. 




 It could have an embargo against releasing reviews until the day it's released, like assassins creed unity  




 Wait 6 months after it comes out, it'll be 1/2 price

$85/mo but I use it for some business work so I can expense it. 




 Back when game distribution wasn't that good, you had to pre-order games in order to ensure that when it came out, you could actually get a copy.  Now you can get virtually every new release in a digital download format, therefore there is an unlimited supply of games.

So, with that being said there is actually 0 reason to pre order a game.  Games will go on sale after they are released.  all pre orders do now is just give game companies money for stuff they haven't done yet.  They know they can just rush games out, un polished, buggy, and patch it up later if need be.  But they don't need to do that, because they'll just work on the next half baked big IP game and shovel in more money from those pre orders. 




 I thought we were stopping the whole pre-order thing now? 




 Stillen Gen 3 will get you the most HP/$ for sure.

I like the sound of the [Stillen Exhaust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw41sSRZ4mU) as well. 

Both of those combined should give you a 30+hp boost for about $2k total.

If you go big, then you can go with a supercharger or Twin turbo kit, but those can be upwards of $10k and get you to 500+ hp at the crank 




 Which is why I don't own a XB1, and won't buy any racing games on the PS4 until GT7. 

Maybe they'll have the G27 figured out by then. 




 I'm really disappointed in Sony that they have snubbed everyone but Thrustmaster.  That's the real issue.  I've spoken with people at Logitech directly (at E3 and PAX) and they say that it doesn't have the little chip inside it to make the unit be recognized as a legit device.

They say they are working on it, but damn, they've been out for a year and nothing.

I'm sure they've done all they can, but Sony isn't letting them have the rights to it for some reason.  




 Don't use so much throttle?  You are in control of how high the engine revs in a manual transmission 




 They just bought 10 Barrel out of Bend Oregon too.  They are scrambling to buy up anyone willing to sell it would seem 




 [The Shark Cannon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MktPVfMrFmg) from Armed and Dangerous was pretty damn good too.

 Did the slave cylinder fail taking out the clutch like mine did after 57k miles?

I got the stillen flywheel and clutch kit combo.  It's a little harder to drive slower and it has a little chatter now but I like it.

I'll be looking into a supercharger later, so that's the reason I upgraded

 How do you know you will like the game or it will be complete when it's released?  They have your money, what incentive do they have to make it extra polished? 




 Yeah I remember. But up until the last few episodes, I was always pulling for Walt. 




 Don't you feel due to the nerves in your arm leading up your spine?  What if you weren't attached to the spine? 




 There is a lot of discussion around the length of time you may or may not be conscious.

But what would it FEEL like?  Would there be pain?  Sounds like a silly question, but if you have no spinal cord attached to your head, what pain could you feel?   




 I get why they were against him, but they didn't see all the work, planning and shit he went through to set them up and their future family for life. 




 I don't think I ever hated him.  I was rooting for him the entire time.  I was pissed when his family found out and just flat out turned and rejected him after all he had done for them.  So much work, so much pain, so much death...all for the family.  And they want nothing to do with him.  Fuck that family. 




 he bounced up and down, but when he hit it the weight transfered up, the car had very little contact with the road. When he came back down, the tires griped again and jerked in a direction he wasn't prepared for and lost control. 




 If you can see a bump in the road 500 feet in front of you, you have not quite 2 seconds to react at 200mph.

at 200mph, the bumps in the road they hit you probably wouldn't even notice a 55mph.  It looked like it had a couple of little hills back to back which threw the car off balance and it would take one hell of a driver to keep it under control.  




 Tracks are bumpy too, you just get a feel for where they are and know how to negotiate them.

The bump that was in this vid probably wasn't even noticeable at 55mph. 

 




 Yeah, the 458 I rented was just a normal seat belt.  It wasn't a racing version, just a normal 458 Italia. 




 Xray says nothing broken

 My house in Lynnwood was $425k and it's easily twice that size and brand new everything.  Why is Bellingham so spendy? 




 You can setup an auto trader alert to email you results daily with very specific criteria.  I did that for my g37 and my wife's veloster.  We got exactly what we wanted. We just had to wait.

 Yup.  Works great.  $15 




 They played even more songs when they played the Neptune in July.   




 A really good one too.  Saw you at deck the hall ball and when you played the Neptune here in Seattle 




 Pepsi points were the zenith of these.  I worked as a bottle returns person at a grocery store in 1996 when pepsi points were around.  No one really collected them with any regularity.  So when people brought their cans and bottles in to recycle, I would take them to the back, cut off all the points (they were on the outside labels plastic bottles and on the cardboard cases of cans) and keep them, then sort them where they needed to go.

I had THOUSANDS of points at the end of the summer and got SO much crap most of it was pretty decent. 




 I guess the article was worded weird.  It should have clarified that the force it takes to fight against gravity increases.

 Hold a 10lb barbell directly over your head. Then keep your arm locked, and slowly lower it in 15 degree increments. See how much harder it is to keep it stable the closer you get to 90 degrees.

Now your shoulder is your neck, and the barbell is your head. 

Your tendons will stretch over time under the added stress and the condition will get worse and worse.

I get a general ache in my upper back from to much phone time. I have a special "pillow" that helps me undo the damage it causes. I rest on it for 10 min a couple days a week to help counter it.

 more specifically, the circle is the only shape that exists that wont pass through itself.  Any other shape (reasonable man sized shape) can fall through in one configuration or another. 




 Ah. I've only watch like 6-7 of the first season.  It's like the office, but public servant version.  I never was able to get into either of the office shows 




 Can I just get a abridged version of Park and Rec where it's JUST the Ron Swanson parts?

I don't feel like burning through 6-7 seasons just so I can see his few scenes. 




 you MIGHT have to take a pic of the grill to get the full effect. 

People that don't know what those are won't know the extent to how far down those go.

try framing the pic so the bottom of the grill is the bottom of the frame and the hood is open with the bottom of the windshield is at the top.

 60/hr.  Not bad. but 1200/mo...meh.  

Thanks for the info though. 




 The big fancy hotels will cater to the business crowd where the bill expensed to a large company or the people that can normally afford 200+ a night don't mind (too much).  


There's a saying..."The more you pay, the less you get".  Take the Porsche 911 GT3 RS.  It's a stripped down light-weight, no frills version of the GT3, but it costs a lot more. 

 




 with all that, what's your definition of "good profit" for 20 hours of work a month. 




 what factors makes your 9 units more profitable than others? 




 Wife = BS in Biochem with 5 yrs exp.  Had to look for 6 months to get a job that pays ok. She works (worked) at Amgen, but through a staffing company that pays her 55k/yr when a direct amgen employee was about 80k.

Friend of wife = MS in Biochem with 8 yrs exp making 48k/yr here.

The market is flooded here and companies are taking advantage.  Go elsewhere or do something else.

 




 That's supply and demand right there. 




 It's close enough to where I don't care.  It makes it a little more unique. customizing your car is fun.

lying about it being imported from Japan...that's douche canoe territory. 




 There is a difference between a Skyline, and a Skyline GT-R (R3x).  I don't think they make a Skyline GT-R since the new platform in 2003.  It's just Skyline 350GT (G35) or the GT-R (R35).

If the kid has GT-R badges, then that's stupid.  If he swapped Infiniti for Skyline...there's nothing wrong with that. 




 R35=USDM GT-R  Similar platform to the G series, but not that close.  the G35 and the Skyline 350GT are VERY close. 




 go on... 




 Fully loaded Optima with the 2.0L Turbo...That would have been my car of choice for the price.

The Tc was basically a less girly Celica. 




 Technically it IS a Skyline, but it's not an R35 by any means. Just because it was "imported" doesn't make it any better (even if it were true).  If I had a 280hp car in High school, i'd feel pretty damn proud of it too.

 Well, to be honest, it's exactly what we intend to do.  Use the capital we've saved, invest it and (hopefully) get a lot more back in the next few years.  Once we have that new return, invest that and accelerate the income generation even more.  In the next 20 years, retire on pure residual income.  




 If you have the know how to setup the production facility, the distribution network, the sales channels, the regulatory compliance, etc. Then go do it yourself.  Be the boss and reap all of the profits.

I feel you in your specific chemical scenario.  My wife is a biochemist.  The business of chemistry and biochemistry is way more lucrative for the business people than the chemists that create the actual content their selling.

As such, she's quitting and we're opening our own business (not chemistry related). 




 I did the same thing at Best Buy.  I was a hourly department manager (not a supervisor, only one in the store) and there were 4-5 Assistant store managers.  

I was making $21/hr + up to 40% bonuses.  They were flat 55-60k/yr + x% bonuses.

They weren't making their numbers to get bonuses, working 50hrs a week (60 for the holidays) and I was at 40 hrs/wk hitting max bonus numbers and had OT when I needed to work more.

After I left, one of the AM's "demoted" herself to my spot.  Same money, less work load.

I have the same thing. I can work 10 hours for weeks on end because I'm good at what I do.  Sometimes it's 70 hours though.  As long as the results are there, I get paid.
