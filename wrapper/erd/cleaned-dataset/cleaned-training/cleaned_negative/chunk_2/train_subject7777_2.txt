RIPOSTE! 




 I always get the last bar of a song I didn't complete looping in my head because of this effect.  On a bad day I have a two-song commute. 




 Slow, SLOW clap.

 I can't remember what it's called.
Bonus points if you can recite the proof. 




 Any other good links on them?

 Bound in human flesh and inked in blood, this crossword puzzle was only mildly difficult.

I couldn't figure out that last word though, started with n and ended with u. 




 He should write a highly controversial book about his experiences called 9 Kampf 




 Which album was it though?

 This must be the 6th time I've seen this.  Still not any good.

 Dude I have so much closure now.  3 









 *Delightfully* Insipid.  Bravo. 




 I feel weird for not going to college but still understanding that as though it's in plain english.  WOO ARMCHAIR PATHOLOGY!

EDIT:  Thanks for being offended that I read about stuff in my spare time?  Y'all are silly. 




 Upvoted everything because Wolfman supremacy. 




 SKOOMA.  NOT EVEN ONCE. 




 Don't worry, gonewild will surely deliver you a ludicrous amount of karma. 




 Hahahaha where at? 




 Saw this meme again.
It was terrible.

 Would not want to be stuck wandering these blocks on a first acid trip. 




 Tried to clone myself, got a chimp with Nicolas Cage face. 




 Actually that's not true, it only affects your bone color.

Some are born trisexual. 




 Hawaii and Arizona do not follow daylight-savings time because they recognize that it is a fraud, and a clear and present danger to the spacetime continuum.

When a program shows at 8:00pm Mountain Time during DST, the conflicting signals cause electrical arcs to surge from the ground in Arizona an hour into the future, killing anyone not wearing crocs or rain boots.  This is much like Tesla's experiments with pulling power out of the vacuum using a wet paper bag and a magnetron.  It was far too dangerous and the program was pulled. 




 Cue shitstorm in 2.. 1.. 




 Aww I wasn't trying to insult, that part was definitely not intentional.
I read a lot of things. 




 It's a good thing that dude's command center is already lifted off.. 




 Neither.  Looked at your post history and noticed you hang out in the biology fora.  Good shit. 




 Bought a ticket.

Thanks.
Maybe I'll see you there and not know it.  You know how that shite goes.

 I just have trouble with the full tilt cerebellar slosh when I'm tripping, oop.

 Just curious as to what you think is happening when you *don't* want to be sardined by lower-echelon drunkards.

Edit:  Thanks for responding y'all.  To those that swung back, sorry, I just figured it'd be better if I specified that I wasn't fishing for the standard fare. 




 I usually stop thinking about it when I recall that.. he took a beating to get to where he was on more than one occasion, which means he's more dedicated to the experiment of government than I am.

At that point, I can't really knock him - even if I think whatever he's working on might be blas. 




 I think that the parliamentary style should apply:

"NO CONFIDENCE"

That's where I'm really at, to be frank. 




 I was getting ready for work and watched about half, listened to the other half.  Stuff like that gets me thinking in the morning before I have to go think for someone else on the clock [whoops, I'm not doing that right now..] 




 It did allow me to read up on Presidential Candidates, but then had no coverage of John Lewis' positions on major subjects for the congressional seat race, which is then further confusing. 




 It's a sample ballot provided by the AJC, ostensibly meant to allow you to COMPARE candidates.  Doesn't really work if there's just an incumbent. 









 Why am I seeing this captcha?


Because:  **SOON**
