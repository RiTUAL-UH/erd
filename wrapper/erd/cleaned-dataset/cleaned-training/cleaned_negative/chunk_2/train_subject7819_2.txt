 Vincent is upset somewhere.  














 Mayweather seems confident going into May 2nd. I doubt the losing thought has not crossed his mind though.  









 With the Boston Marathon coming up I wanted to see how shoes are made, this focuses on Asics but their generally made the same way. 









 Lol 




 I just bought the Nimbus 17s for 119.00 at Eastbay. 




 Where can I buy these shoes at a decent price? The lowest price on the 17s I have found is $127 total out the door new. Does anyone have insight on a lower price or discount? 




 It's almost become like a machine, follow the Zebra and hang on, granted if your not in shape you won't last. I think it's neat though, there so many different ways to win. Example, in basketball they created Hack a Shaq which would prove positive for the opposition in regaining possession without giving up time and points.  




 Interesting how it's become about the records. 









 I've used it but does it work for enabling/disabling mobile hotspot?  




 What about turning my ringer on when I receive a phone call, and mute after call ends? 




 Are there any that automatically toggle my mobile hotspot on when I leave home, and off when I return. 




 Seriously,  Paul needs more respect, this is despicable.  














 8-9 May, approximately 250 with registration, tolls, gas, and Lake House Stay. 




  8-9 May 




 Yeah we still need four, the smallest leg is 11 miles. 




 We have 8, I'm sure we'll find 4 more, just a little stressful this close to race day.

 Mark will leave his imprint in the league, he's done a great job so far, I can only wait to see what's next.

 As long as Mike, Dan or Will don't win, this season will be a success.  




 I want tickets, maybe Probst will pick me. 




 That's about a quarter of the season ouch.

 He wants more playing time this year, he's up an coming. 




 Wow seriously 




 Lol 



















 Their just waiting to be voted out, not making any moves.  




 Shirin is dangerous.  




 Interested to see what monkey wrench Jen throws. 




 I read someone does this for living?  Seriously who? 




 He's all of them photo shopped together.  




 I mean seriously.  




 Just the tide turning, hopefully Rodney is aware enough that Joe smells blood. 




 They need the Survivor Auction.  




 No 




 I'm hoping she still wins, but the cards aren't looking so good. Survivor has a luck aspect and at the moment it's going Will and Mikes way. 




 She's hanging on by a thread.  




 He's no sham. 




 Vote for you. 




 Who looks more gassed, Will or Dan? 




 Will dives like a gazelle.  




 Me 



















 If you can't beat them sue them, is that the new way to success.  




 Seriously, I feel Manny is going to psyche himself out. 




 10 miles in 80 minutes.  




 It seems like she's moments away from coming unhinged.  




 I don't see Will doing well in this challenge,  still don't know what he brings to the tribe.  




 Off to a great start and a lot of potential.

 Move will to the Blue Collar. 




 They need to get rid of the coat tail Will. 




 Ratings, perhaps more viewers will tune in to catch a glimpse of what transpired.  




 Wouldn't it be considered an offensive foul the way that Harden drives into people even though clear lanes exist? With his eurostep moves he could be on his way to injury just as Ginobili and Parker wore down. 




 Thanks

 Geolocation? 




 I feel the Yankees are going to wear on him and try to make him quit. 




 Tom Brady was picked up in the 6th, there has to be some gems left in the 7th. 









 This seems interesting, just trying to figure out the motive. 









 And Will can't do much of anything.  




 Sierra will make it to the end and be shut out, no self awareness.  




 Seriously, how was the ticket appropriate?  




 Ah typo, meant Boy Meets World, good one, chuckled.  




 Great show, still remember this as a kid. 




 Seriously will this be the theme all the way up to the fight?

 The image was captured last week at the re-launching of the TIDAL music streaming service. While this is but a moment in time, it does provide a very useful body language teaching moment. 

Madonna is standing in a modified fig-leaf position. She is of course, a very alpha personality - yet in THIS particular moment, she's definitely feeling more beta and with a lower confidence level than she's been on many an occasion. 

Deadmau5 is standing with his hands in his back pockets and his thumbs-forward. This is a good alpha-beta hybrid stance and shows a high-confidence, but not one that is too high or too assertive.

Kanye West is standing with his arms crossed in front of his chest and without his hands visible. This signals he's defensive, closed-minded and - when we correlate this with his facial expression - we can say that Kanye is also feeling threatened and impatient. He wants out of this spot-light. He feels very beta and acquiescent to Jay Z's alpha, intelligence and relatively superior social skills. 

Jay Z has his hands behind his back. We cannot tell how they are clasped, yet we can say this is a very confident, alpha stance. It sends signals of leadership and strength - yet as with all alpha signals, if this is over-displayed (for longer durations) - it will transmit signals of hyper-alpha mindsets, arrogance, aloofness, and condescending emotional tones. It's not surprising that he's standing this way since he's the principle business actor of the new Tidal music-streaming service, but he should not remain this way for too long.

 Stretches 3,000 miles. 




 You'd  think the NFL would test for both simultaneously.

 Thanks. 




 Collector's item. 




 The service is not worth it. A lot of bugs are yet to be worked out. Sling TV works a lot like cable, you can't replay what you want and have to watch what's playing live. 




 I have seen some news organizations give credit and link back to the OP at the end of their article, that's why readers keep coming back because their not trying to be shady. 




 Where's Shia LeBoeuf?  




 I don't necessarily think their shortcomings just a different way of learning/thinking, maybe in the next century docs will find a way to turn on/off the switch you mention.  




 Wow amazing. 




 Yep thanks for your advice, no one mentioned litigation. We are provided with a ABA therapist already, private insurance so we do get collaborate and have things to work on at home, just want it to carry into the classroom, except there is so much pushback. Thanks for the education, you must be well versed in special education laws... 




 Yes I feel that my child needs one, we hired one through our insurance provider so there is no cost to the district, we just want for the BCBA to provide services and collaborate one day a week in school. One day a week is that so difficult? This is to ensure what their teaching my son is being done right, which so far has not been the case. Just food for thought.  









 We spoke with the IEP team and our private ABA therapist is allowed in the classroom for observation, but I want for the therapist to collaborate with the school and provide services to my son as well. I don't know how Florida and Maryland Special Education laws could vary. 




 Thanks

 That's what matters right. 




 Wow eye opening thanks for the article.

 Interesting point of view, what would the court base their decision on? 




 I'm sure with the notoriety a policy will be written or maybe not but agree, a sick move. 




 Agreed, the Principal doesn't want people who haven't earned the letter to wear one.  




 Their almost at break even, paying 50 dollars per Pay Per View is pricey, maybe their trying the Netflix model which has worked pretty well. 




 What happened to "In Bill We Trust"? 




 I'm interested, live in Texas.  




 How can I sign up for what you do? That's some good pay and your home nightly. 




 I'm human.  




 Funny movie.  




 Thanks haven't seen this one, it looks insightful.

 Nice rebuttal.  




 No one wants any casualties.  




 I know they deserve a slow demise but will they, is the public to attached to the brand to buy anything they sell?

 Great work, it's neat.

 Yes its time.
