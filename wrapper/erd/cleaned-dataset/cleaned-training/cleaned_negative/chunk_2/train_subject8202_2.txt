 You would miss Fox Sports 1   2, Pac 12 network, Big Ten network, CBS Sports Network. You would also miss any regional sports network in your area, going by your Umass flair you would miss NESN and CSN New England. Out of all of these the only networks listed here with "good" games would be FS1 and the Pac12 and B1G networks (which you already said you don't get). The RSN and CBSSN have some games but I think you can afford to not have them as it's usually lower tier games  




 let's be real if fox news was around at the time they would be defending the racists as trying to stop "traditional America" from being destroyed by the evil federal government and "activist judges"  




 the title implies that the merger got federal approval, and most people  on this site don't read the article just the title  




 Click bait:  this is the state of California approving the merger, not the FCC, Justice Department, or the Federal Trade Commission

 We're in D3 now as part of the [Southern Athletic Association](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Athletic_Association) so we wouldn't play them, besides I don't think we have any real history with Rienhardt (funny enough my brother goes there). I think our new rival might be Oglethorpe 




 Well our main rival has always been Shorter University across town, but sense they moved up to D2 I don't know if that will continue  




 No I'm good at it. I FUCKING HATE Florida and Virginia Tech.

 I'm very uneasy about this plan. Seems like it's giving the state and the governor too much power.  




 As I told the other person My comment wasn't directed at funding SC State. It was aimed at the fact that /u/SCRx seemed to imply that the state of SC struggles to fund all of it's public universities because of the fact that the state doesn't bring in much money from its low taxes. So I proposed the crazy idea of raising taxes to fund education in general, not SC State.

 I haven't cared about this story since day one. The man is a human being, their are many instances of a persons memories being incorrect do to the fog of the incident, or just random crap that happens as time goes by. Heck some Holocaust survivor stories have turned out not to be true. So I don't blame Brian one bit and think that he is being shat on way too much. He is the best among the evening news anchors and I will continue to watch him.  




 umm, hears a crazy thought why doesn't the state raise taxes in order to help pay for this massive school system?

 Today 5 more counties started offering gay marriage licenses after not doing so yesterday. 

Also it sounds like the governor has a sound head on his shoulders (never thought I would say that of an Alabama politician). 
It is important for people across the country to know that the governor of Alabama today is not the governor of Alabama 50 years ago. 

**and**

I dont want Alabama to be seen as it was 50 years ago when a federal law was defied. Im not going to do that, Im trying to move this state forward.

Of note: It is the 50th anniversary of the March on Selma in about 3 weeks, I think this is fresh on his and other Alabamans minds right now.

 I didn't speak to him but a saw Jerry Springer a few rows ahead of me at a Cubs game. Same with Shaq saw him on the sidelines of the chick-fil-a bowl a few years back. I did however say hello once to congressman John Lewis of Atlanta once as I passed him in the airport.

 Also top voted comment on the article is as follows 


**Thomas:**
I walked into his chambers and could feel his steely eyes staring me down. His imposing figure loomed over me as I pressed my back against the wall. Roy dropped his judicial robes to the floor to reveal his well maintained body in all of its glory. His firm member showed a passion. It betrayed by his stone faced expression.
"I always wondered if you wore anything while you were on the bench..." I whispered.
"Shut up" Roy said as he advanced. He grabbed my shoulders forcefully and spun me around, bending me over his large mahogany desk. He drove himself into me from behind causing me to help slightly as I gripped the papers on his desk, moving them from the orderly piles there to be clenched in a fit of pain and passion.
"Oh, Roy!" I called out. "Shut up, Tommy" he insisted through gritted teeth.
Such was my first time.

**Response from Gary:** 
pervert

**Thomas reply:** 
Just when I thought my body could take no more, as I gasped and panted on the verge of collapse, Gary came in wearing a tight, wet T-shirt with a grin on his face.
"No, I can't..."I sputtered.
"You can." Roy said firmly.
"And you will." Gary said.
I lay back, ready to take whatever fate had brought me.
It was like kissing God.

**Gary again:** 
I take great satisfaction in knowing Hell is in your future.

**Thomas reply:**
"I take great satisfaction in knowing Hell is in your future." Gary said as he forced himself into my mouth. He arched his back as he did so before looking back down to me. "Now accept thy Lord..."
 




 this is fucking awesome  




 how do I do that?  




 You don't have to click the link, the headline is all you really need.  




 yes I know it's a christian site but I wanted to share the bigotry/crazy

edit: For those that don't want to give the site clicks the headline is all you really need, also he said this on his facebook page so this is not an "official" order yet. It should also be noted the the governor said yesterday that he would not seek charges against judges who issue marriage licenses to gay couples. So once again Moore is alone in this fight.

 Best quote from the article:
Asked if he believes a transgender woman is a woman, Artiles said, I am not going to get into that. I have not spent much time thinking about that.

So clearly, he is the foremost authority to author a bill specifically about that subject 




 I'll wear the hate with honor, I can be /u/EmperorofOrange and you can be /u/wake_is_great. I'll poke you when ever I'm bored   




 I live in the Atlanta area. Mom has no interest in her school's team (Clemson) and Dad is an extremely jaded UVA fan because of their struggles over the last 15 years so it was hard for me to be a fan of either of them because I was never exposed to them when I was young. So I just latched onto the two big schools here. 




 I know :D 




 I really like airports as well!! I like just exploring the place and just taking in the sheer size of the place. I also like watching planes move about and seeing the organized chaos of it all.  




 I hate beer and sweet tea. I can't stand coffee unless its loaded with cream, sweetener, or flavoring (or one of those pricey fancy Starbucks drinks). Also we recently got a Cookout and I don't see what all the hype is about, it tastes shitty to me (with exception to the milkshakes). And while I'm at it Chick-fil-A is just average fast food, people around here treat it like gospel

 First I'm hearing about it, good to know. It that's the case then the $1 billion could definitely be used on public transportation (lord knows Atlanta needs it)

 Have two tests today and got only 4 hours of sleep last night, and after class I work til 5pm, so today will be a little rough  




 The design laid out here is definitely an improvement over what is there now. But I still can't help but wonder if this money would be better served either on public transportation or widening 400 past McFarland  




 I honestly think that at this point he is secretly gay, how else do you explain a man so hell bent on stopping gay marriage?

 He'll issue marriage licenses as he will be required to because of Federal Court rulings. However he will not officiate wedding ceremonies as he fells that they go against god. Other local media sources says that all wedding ceremonies will end so that gays can't have ceremonies in the courthouse

 I personally am not that much of a beer drinker - or really alcohol drinker to be honest - and have a negative opinion of alcohol in general because my mother is an alcoholic so I don't drink much of the stuff. Of course it helps I've never really found a "real" alcohol product that I liked (the only alcohol that I like are mixed drinks - daiquiris and the like - and Bailey's )  




 I'm still baffled that ALA-FUCKING-BAMA beat Georgia in getting gay marriage  




 It's the KFC Double Down Dog, available in the [Philippines] ( http://news.yahoo.com/kfc-unleashes-double-down-dog-philippines-084419953.html) 




 what was the rule that was changed?  




 Mad Men, I find it incredibly boring  




 I heard that it was the Women's Temperance Movement (the same people who pushed for prohibition) that campaigned to make it illegal  




 I haven't been to that many games involving my teams, the worst experience that I can remember having is at the peach bowl (it was either 2002 or 2004). We live in the Atlanta area and my dad gets tickets through work every year to the game. So we usually don't have a stake in either team. We had some extra tickets and their was this family of Tennessee fans that needed tickets. My mom was like "oh they look like a nice clean cut family, why don't we sell our extra tickets to them". We did and they were so thankful, get to are seats in the Dome and they are right next to us. Well the moment the game starts these people turn into the most obnoxious drunk fans I have ever experienced. They were shouting so much that the people in front of us had to ask them to shut up because they were shouting right into their ears. The last straw was when the wife spilt beer on the guy in front of her, security was called and they were escorted out. We have never sold extra tickets to anyone since.  




 I'm not trying to trivialize the issue, what I'm criticizing is that the NFL is all of a sudden caring about this issue and saying that they are going to do more and donate money to charities. When in reality  they are spending so little on domestic violence considering they make $10 billon a year. I'm also criticizing the fact that they partnered with NOmore, an organization that is not a nonprofit and is completely fake seeming to only be for branding http://deadspin.com/do-the-nfls-anti-domestic-violence-initiatives-actually-1682681513 




 Don't worry it was at an NCAA approved transaction

 How did you become a Bayor fan in France 




 Watch Pete Carroll try to explain the last play call https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjUzsaQ9a_E 




 Maybe so but at least Always did it of their own accord and aren't doing it because of a PR disaster ^cough NFL NOmore.org ^cough and the Always also came across more natural and sincere than the NOmore ads which again are nothing but PR. But people see things differently so I can see where you are coming from 




 I don't follow CBB that much, did your team regress or something?  




 I don't think it was an entirely bad idea, it may have just been poor execution (pardon the pun). I think the idea is that instead of promoting their product they are promoting household safety, like the Always commercial isn't promoting their product but treating women with dignity and not ostracizing women/girls.

 well then 




 But the thing is that it's just an NFL PR move and nothing more. If the Ray Rice fiasco hadn't happened you wouldn't be seeing any of these ads.

 for me it's that one, the Fiat one, and clash of clans 




 Clash of clans afford a superbowl ad with Liam Nelson? It was awesome though
