 Title says it all - Please **VOTE!!!** 





























 I recently read this quote from our president:

 A few timid people who fear progress, will try to give you new and strange names for what we are doing. Sometimes they will call it fascism; sometimes communism; and sometimes socialism. 




 But in so doing, they are trying to make very complex, something that is really very simple, and very practical. 


--------------

And I read what they say about him:


* People everywhere are growing impatient.  On the right  organized by some of the most powerful industrialists charging that the presidents actions are only making things worse.

  That the president has become a dictator, defying the constitution, encouraging class warfare. Saying the president is hell-bent on socialism. There can only be one capital, they say; Washington or Moscow. There can only be one flag. The stars and stripes, or the flag of the godless Soviets. His enemies only referred to him as that man in the White House. Because they cannot bear to say his name. 

  On the left socialist and some communist took to the street denouncing the president as a captive of capitalism; incapable of bringing about real change.

---------------------

Hearing this makes me wonder what they will say about Obama in the history books in the years to come.

What are your thoughts about what they say now and do you believe he will be remembered differently or just like what the say now? I mean has any other president been so hated at the time, ever end up being considered a great president after all the smoke clears or is Obama stuck with the hatred forever? 



















 I have been negligent in sending out thanks for all the support and cards you have sent me and my 92 year old mom. She laughs and smiles when I bring her the cards. It has been rough but all of you have made things more bearable.

It's amazing how the support comes from every corner of the world. I just can not express my appreciation in this challenging time.

She is still in the care facility and her mental capacity has returned. But physically she is still extremely weak. We are hopeful that she will keep getting stronger and eventually may be able to bring her home.

Your support means everything to both me and her. 

Thank you. Thank you so much.

 The time has come and in this last crucial week /r/democrats will be dedicated solely to election issues and getting out the vote.

The only reason democrats lose in the midterms is because of voter turnout. 

**It's time to get off our asses and rally our base to make their voices heard.**

Many important contests are in a virtual tie. We can make a difference if we just get out and vote.

And don't tell me your vote doesn't count. That is the lamest excuse I have ever heard. It counts now more than ever.

* **Effective until November 4th, all posts in /r/democrats must be election and get out the vote related. We can do this. It's time to do your part!** 


































 My mom is 92 and very hard of hearing and bedridden. She has to have the TV full-blast for her to hear it. I'm looking for something wireless that I can plug into her TV sound she can listen to it through an earbud or headphones. She will have the TV at the foot of her bed.

Nothing fancy is needed at. Just something that will give her basic loud sound without other having to hear it. 
























 In the episode "Birthday Month," Axe Cop say he was born in 2004. How can he only be 10 years old?

And yes I know it's a cartoon but it seems weird he would only be 10 years old. 



















 They keep panning to fans dressed in panda bear costumes. What is that all about?


**EDIT: Question answered** 














 Most states cut off voter registration 30 days before the election. Tomorrow is that day.

**REGISTER NOW - And I mean today!**

**Last chance!** 














 We have one of your countrymen starving out there and we want to get this guy a pizza. I live in the US and could not find a way to order and pay for one. 

If one of you can get him a pizza, I will send you the money to reimburse you.

Here is his post in our subreddit /r/Assistance:

http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/2i7xwv/havent_eaten_since_monday/

I promise I will reimburse you. And I never break a promise.  














 I'm late at sending out thanks to you all. Mom got really sick and has been in the hospital this last week. Up until today it did not look good. Her mental state was gone. I was fearing the worst.

But today when I visited her, she was back. She was asking questions and  her mind was obviously back. I brought the cards you sent for her birthday that are still coming in and she loved them. From Germany, New Zealand, cities throughout the US, Australia and so many other places. She was reading them and smiling. Medicine that could not have come from anywhere else and it was working great.

Thank you all for keeping my mom happy and alive. Say some prayers that her recovery continues. Bless you all! :D

There are many people who are in Nursing Homes that are not Seniors Citizens , But cant take care of theirselfs because they are handicapped .The sad part is most of their families passed away and there was no one else to look after them. They need everyday items, like soaps, shampoo,lotion , socks, slippers, underwear   person body care items.. I hope to post a Amazon/Walmart wishlist. I am also going to be collecting new   used items. If anyone has any other ideas to share that will be great. . Thanks again. : )

And yes Christmas is just around the corner. :D 



































































































 I seem to remember ISIS's black flag being flown over the embassy. Was it ISIS that attacked our embassy and killed our people?

If so, doesn't this warrant going after the people responsible? 




 It's all over but the voting. Who do you think took the prize? And maybe say why. 







































 Today I went to my sister's house for my mom's birthday. I kind of hate going to stuff like that because I always have to hear all that right-wing extremist crap. I mean they make FOX News look liberal. Especially my evil brother. The ignorance that comes out of his mouth is excruciating. I gave up long ago trying discuss anything with him.

So they are going on and on about the football player that beat his wife and the black guy that got killed in Ferguson and somehow made it about how unfair they were being to white people. How they got there I will never know. I was just biting my tongue but finally mentioned Zimmerman. The conversation went on without my participation but it was just so vile and ignorant. Talking about how unfair Zimmerman was treated and what a piece of shit the kid that got killed was. And how the black guy that got killed in Ferguson ruined that cops's life.
After several minutes of listening to this garbage, I finally just stood up and said:

"Yea..., those fucking niggers!"

Everyone just went silent and gasped. Even though for the last 20 minutes, that's what they had been basically saying. They thought it was horrible how I paraphrased it for them. They were not happy with me today. But I was giggling to myself how I actually out-extremed the extremists. 














 You may have noticed I have been pretty absent  here the last couple weeks. It's because I have the flu. And this thing just doesn't seem to want to go away.

Please by all that is holy - 

**GO GET YOUR FLU SHOT!!!**

This thing is the worst.

Here is a government site that will give you locations to get yours:

Please don't wait. This thing sucks. I'll see ya again soon when I get well. God forbid you get this damn thing. 




 Hearing that Scotland is voting to leave the UK is kind of surprising to some of us less UK-knowledgeable Americans. Could you give us the basics of who and what makes up the UK? 




 Some races are very close and upsets are very possible if we join together and just vote. But to do so, you need to register and do it soon.

**PLEASE REGISTER NOW!**

I will gladly find out how and where you can register in your state if you just tell me your city and state. 

**And please vote in November.** 



















 I've had it with ATT. Not because of the price or any other service. But because they continually manipulate and lies to me. Each month for the last six months I had to make that dreaded call to ask why my bill went up $20.  I would win the argument but then they would do it again the next month. 

Anyway, I need a new internet and TV service. Who should I get? 









 A really nice redditor provided us with this link on how to add an address to your Amazon wishlist. It was soooooo helpful. It saved the mods so many headaches trying to explain to people how to do that. They made it in pictures that was so simple anyone could understand it. Check it out:

* https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B37BFyksMPvcNUpNeW9VT0N2TGc/edit

What we really could use is the same thing that explains how to make an Amazon wishlist from scratch. It would be aimned at people who are not good at computers and have never made an Amazon wishlist before. Come Christmas we are running both subs and it is an insane amount of work for us. Explaining the wishlist consumes way too much of our time. The format with the pictures like the one above would be most preferred. 

Is there anyone who would be willing to make this for us? 

P.S. Christmas is closer than you think. :D 




 I promised to buy a needy Canadian some coffee. But every frickin' place I try to order it from will not send it to Canada  from the US. It doesn't have to come from the US. It can be sent from Canada to Canada. I just have to pay for it from the US.

Not looking for anything fancy. Just some plain old regular coffee. I've been trying for hours with no success. It's such a simple thing but is turning into a major hassle. Can you give me an online site that will allow me to send this poor woman some coffee?

----------------------

**EDIT:**

**Thank you all for your help. I finally found a place to do it. :D** 




 I run /r/santaslittlehelpers where we require requests to include am Amazon wishlist. We spend so much of our time coaching people in how to make a wishlist. Some of these users can barely send an email. It is so frustrating and time consuming for us.

We of course had the problem of them not adding their shipping address until a very kind redditor gave us this link to show them how:

*https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B37BFyksMPvcNUpNeW9VT0N2TGc/edit

It really helped out. Now we are looking for the same kind of thing that explains with pictures, how to make a basic wishlist.

Is there one in existence or would someone be willing to make one for us? 

Our subscribers last year provided over $20,000 of gifts from Amazon to those in need so you could see how frustrating it gets instructing so many to make a basic wishlist. To have a link we could give them that would explain it in the simplest of terms, with pictures like the link above, would be awesome beyond awesome.

Anyone out there know of one or would be willing to create one? 





























 I'm curious if people of reddit would consider this as an abuse of presidential powers. So many of you questioned  whether the president can legally authorize the killing of a U.S. citizen fighting for a foreign terrorist group in the past.

If so, what would make this case different than the other ones he targeted. If not, do you think he should be powerless if he can't get at him to bring back to America for trial? 












































 Yes. In fact your votes are the only ones that matter.
Elections are not decided by republicans or democrats. Their votes basically cancel each other out. They sway from one side back and forth, but rarely are the deciding factor.

In most presidential elections, the percentage difference is around 5%. If all the people who say their vote doesn't matter would vote, then they would matter. They would easily sway the vote one way or the other. The direction our country takes can easily be changed by a small percentage that does not vote. The very people who say their vote does not count.

**In practical reality, your votes are the only ones that do count.** 














 Last year saw the launch of our sister-sub, /r/SantaLittleHelpers. It was a smashing success and you awesome people made the difference for so. so many people.

We are currently working behind the scenes to not only supply Christmas for thousands, but to have the time of our lives doing it.

**We need your ideas for events, contests and just fun things to do over the six weeks we will be operating.**

Myself and others will be donating prizes for contests but we are looking for fun ways that keep us all in the spirit of Christmas. Please be creative. Of course we want to bring Christmas to those that who otherwise wouldn't have it. But we want to have fun while doing it. Looking forward to hearing your ideas.

Oh and by-the-way, here is our video from last year, in case you missed it.

We seriously want it to make it look like Santa had an acid trip there. So we are looking for someone to decorate the place up for us. Here is a real chance to show your creativity and help us bring Christmas joy to the world. Anyone feel like taking up the challenge?

 My eye sight sucks and I need an illuminated keyboard that is easy to read. The one I got before totally sucks because the keys are too close together and I am constantly accidentally hitting caps locks. And the shift key is sticky as hell. I absolutely hate it. 

So I am breaking down and getting a new one. I am not a gamer. Just an average smuck on a computer. Would love a recommendation for a medium priced keyboard to make this old man a little less grumpy.

 Something real slow and that uses simple chords. But real pretty when sung solo by a male? An old classic is preferable but not required.

It would be a toward the end song. You know when everyone is tired and ready to call it a night.

Almost like a lullaby type slow.

---------------------

Totally awesome suggestions. Keep 'em coming itf you would. Some of these may not be the ending lullabye but some that I will still want to work in.

But this is the song I think I'm going to go with. Tell me if you agree:

 I can think of no better way to allow legislation that the people want than to have votes on issues in a proposition style election like the states have. I imagine we would have to change the constitution to allow it but doesn't it make sense?
I've just never heard anyone suggest it before. 
























 This our true friend and a couple of the nurses won't let anyone visit here. She'll be gone in few days and it won't make any difference. Shouldn't she be allowed to be comforted by her friends in her last days?

 People need to tag their posts in our subreddit. It is a quite simple task:

* http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/29ifmv/how_to_add_a_tag/

But the option to add a tag isn't showing up for some all of a sudden. It's worked perfectly fine in the past. They just click that option pictured here:


* http://i.imgur.com/UO28rZh.jpg


But some say it isn't  showing up for them. We've not had this problem in over a year of using it. Any speculation on what has caused the problem? Is it maybe it's just a temporary glitch? 




 It seems people are having trouble adding a tag.

Just click the add tag option under your post you just made:

Click on the proper tag (or type one yourself) and press **save**

That's it. It's two clicks and **save**
