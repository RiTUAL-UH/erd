 Canon DSLRs suffer from automated gain control. When the sound in the room is quiet it boosts the gain automatically. So what happens is when you talk it might sound normal, but in between lines the sound of the room or the room tone becomes louder as auto gain control rises. Even with a Rode mic it does the same thing. Magic Lantern gives you a few set gain options and disables auto Gain. 

Your best bet for a long term solution is to get an external audio recorder like a Zoom H4n and sync the audio and video up later. H4n's have decent on board mics that are far superior to the rode mic and you have the option to plug in two additional mics via XLR ports in the future when you can afford a decent shotgun mic or Lavaliere.

 When I made films in high school I forgot quite a few things. So you are so far ahead of where I was. You kept pretty good continuity and had plenty of coverage. That being said, start asking yourself what the shot looks like. Change up the shot size.

For example, a great way to show how alone and vulnerable the kid is is to take the camera all the way to the other end of the hall (an extreme long shot) and show how empty and big the hallway is. Take this approach across the film. Use camera distance to convey emotion. Close-ups are more intense and can be used to show extreme emotions or build tension. And don't be afraid of coming from a different angle than just eye-level.  Anyway, that's my two cents. Good work!
