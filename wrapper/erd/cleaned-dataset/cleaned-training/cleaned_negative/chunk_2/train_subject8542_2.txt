 I'm probably a tad late for this one, but I'll post anyway.
Not even my story, either, but my Parents'.

I was 12, and I was staying out at a friends place a few miles away, my sister was also out at her friends just down the street.

Must have been about 11pm, my parents were sat on the sofa downstairs, watching TV and getting ready to go to sleep, when they heard a small thumping upstairs from my room, then nothing.

A minute or two later, down the stairs came 5 or 6 little bouncy balls (You know, the kind which are tiny, choking hazards to children and bounce like motherfuckers)

Now, in order for the bouncies that were in my room to come down the stairs, they'd have to roll out of my room, down a corridor, turn left twice and then bounce down.

Here's the funny bit.

*Mine were still in my room*

 My sister didn't own any. She wasn't awesome enough. 




 I'd imagine just holding it out if your arms are long enough (Or if the chainsaw is shorter), then stabbing yourself with it.

 Making a Re-entry, Commander Shepard style 




 I'm in Warehousing and Transport. I like the transport side of things, but the warehousing is monotonous and boring as all hell. But it gets stuff shipped countrywide, so I guess I'm doing a good job. 




 If it's just a quick, write a list and you get whatever's on that list..

House for me. House overseas for the parents, when they retire, Spain most likely.
House for my sister and her boyfriend, just to shut 'em up

Clear all current loans. Buy a new car for me, nothing flash, though!

Buy a bunch of tailored clothes, because I'm sick of wearing Jeans and graphic tees. :( 




 It's been 5 years, but every time your name comes up on the Instant Messenger and we talk, the memories come flooding back.

I don't think I'll ever be fully over you.. It's probably why I'm not even slightly interested in dating still.
 




 Well, as I open the most played playlist on my phone..

 Been using 'em a while now. Very good. Using speedtest.net I get 9MBS. I'm pretty sure we're signed up for the 10MB service, too. 

Though I recall they used to provide a 16MB service, we might have signed up for that. 




 I've never actually been, but I've driven past it a few times when heading to the Academy for a gig.

I'll have to drop in sometime. 




 Coolio55

*cringe*

train_subject8542 is set in stone now, been using this since I was 15. 




 White Russians, or Vodka + Coke. They're only if I've got some money to throw, though.

Otherwise it's just a bottle of cider for me! 




 Pet Puppies seems to work, but I quite like Watch Ponies myself.

[](/hahaha"Because Ponies are awesome.") 




 Aye, could be. I've raid healed on a druid (85) in ToC before, but druids and paladins are totally different. xD 




 I can heal... when I eventually get back to playing properly. 
Might need a little bit of practice in Raid healing, though.

If not, I can powerlevel my hunter.. I have a _lot_ of experience with them 




 Not sure. I saw the stream pause for a few seconds during the Audience Questions, but otherwise it seemed pretty seamless. 




 This took too long to write up.  
[](/twicrazy"Clock...is.. TICKING!") 









 I can't even get back to the proper sign in page now, I've just logged out and I get the e-mail sign up form.

Try signing out of facebook, maybe? I don't have one. 




 I signed up with just my e-mail. There's a small link under the "Sign up with Facebook" button saying "Sign up with e-mail" 




 Totally up for it, but my sister's 18th is the same night. Next time! 




 Underwear by Royal Republic 




 Lots of shit flinging going on in here.

What the fuck, did I go to a school where the kids were _mostly_ normal?

Weirdest kid in our school was a Jehovah's Witness. Liked to poke everyone he met. He came knocking on my door the other day. Poked me in the nose for old times' sake and wandered off. 




 22 in a few weeks here. Full time Warehouser/Van Driver/Techie for 5 years, Engineer's Assistant for a year before that.

I keep the Ponies and IRL seperate. Moreso after my sister spilled the beans on my Pony music listening habits to facebook. Coworkers saw and ribbed me for a few days.  




 When it comes to society breakdown, or invasion - us brits are screwed. xP I wouldn't even know where to begin looking to find a firearm.

I got lots of sharp pointy things. Do they count? (I'm an avid weapon collector. Got various axes, swords and daggers mounted in my room) 




 Sorry. I mean I'd just forget the doors were smaller, and bash my head on the top of the doorframe.

I type like I talk. :D 




 Hide in the woods. As long as I was quiet about it, I doubt they'd come looking for me. Take a lot of tinned food and see how long I'd last. Sneak out and scavenge shops for more tinned, precooked food.

I'd be a terrible fugitive. 




 I'd say the same, but only if I was a pony myself. Those doors are tiny, I would slip up and twat my head on a door many times.

[](/hahaha"Because Ponies are awesome.") 




 What?! Sweet is outdated?

Fuck. 




 Hell, I still kind of like them. Their new album I can quite happily listen to. I listen to music to fill the day, I don't listen for imperfections, or genius.

It's a band (or a person) who's picked up an instrument, or sang, put it on a CD so I can listen to it.

I'm not gonna give anyone shit for listening to anything.

Haters gonna hate. 




 Could be, though I'm not sure how they'd get in the space between my floor and the kitchen roof.

Hell, how they'd even get in the house is a question in itself, I have a dumb, lovable dog and 2 bastard cats which attack anything that moves. 




 Every single night, about 1am-ish, there's a scratching in my floor. It doesn't wake me up, I just hear it if I'm awake.
 
At first, I thought it was my dog, scratching at something downstairs, but one night, I was downstairs and I heard the scratching above me.

I've been hearing it since I moved in, about 13 years ago. I want to know what it is! 




 [](/derpwizard)I derp'd 
 




 I saw some "Malteaster" chocolates in Mid November. Kinda did a double take at the petrol station I was at. 




 Not sure. Being a site writer on a fansite, I should really know these things.

"Pinkie Pie tries babysitting Cake's twin toddlers but finds it harder than she thought."

back to the subreddit! [](/hahaha) 




 Just wait 'til Saturday. It's gonna be brilliant! [](/ppboring) 




 When I was 14 or something and still used myspace, I believed that the 9/11 terrorist attacks were an inside job.

Yeah - I grew out of that pretty quick. 




 [](/flutteryay) Not all warehousers are assholes. 

I'm a warehouser.  It's all about personal taste. 




 I'll be outside with a giant swizzle straw! [](/party) 




 It's like a great big black hole.
Once you're in, you never leave.

This is not a bad thing [](/hahaha"I wouldn't want to, anyway!") 




 My brain says I should be ashamed, but my heart is currently fist pumping. 




 Well, you've all knocked us Mancs off the top spot.

I'm not sure whether to be ashamed or proud of this. 




 [](/hahaha) Happy New Year from the UK, Everypony! I may had had one too many doughnuts...

[](/punchdrunk) 




 My brain broke even trying to read this.
[](/derp)

I tried 5 times. 




 [](/hahaha"I want to go to the Future!")Maybe in 10 years, when we have some amazing paper.

 




 Currently [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JETHNPLV7Tk).
It'll probably stick for a while too. 




 I have two peices of advice for you. 

Try to avoid Salford at night, and for the love of god, don't mention Scousers unless you're taking the piss out of them. Or Southerners for that matter. 




 Good. Channel that rage.

Right into that there Dragon's neck. 




 Ow! Arrow!
It came from the sky! **IT WAS THE DRAGONBORN!** 




 After wasting weeks and weeks on heroic mode, I started to really dislike "AS YOUR PATHETIC MAGIC BETRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYS YOOOOU"

I was a hunter too, so it didn't even affect me! 




 Yep. Dropped the parents off at my Aunts and I stayed back. With the girls it's shopping and gossip, with the guys, it's football and beer, and there'll be about 10 kids running and screaming.

I just want to chill out and chill with friends, talk shiny things and play video games. 




 The Fire isn't even available here in the UK, I've got the Kindle 4 (non-touch) 




 Slow as in slow to change page? I got the download off EQD and it seems to be running fine!  




 Got my kindle for Christmas too.

[This is going to take a looooong time to read.](http://i.imgur.com/y6KyT.jpg) 




 KFC do breakfasts?
Shit, I've never seen them. What are they offering? 




 I'm not sure. My daft mate left the reciept in from Argos, was 20 or something. Still bloody awesome. I love it, been after one for a while. 




 If you're only 10 minutes away, it's not too bad. Though the campsite has some great craic going on. 




 Download Festival Tickets (:D!) and a laser projector to make pretty patterns on the roof.

 




 Last week, I'd gone to bed quite late, despite having to get up early the next day. The parents and the sister knew I was going to be doing a looooong drive down to London to deliver stuff - rest was vital.

It's 2am. "Can you come pick me up? I'm in Manchester, I don't want to wait for a bus.."

I promptly told her to shove it and went back to sleep. 




 "Dude. Do you wanna go play ball or go for a run or something?"

**"SHIT YEAH"** 




 I love him. Every time I fight him, I always /y "TIMMAY!" back at him. 




 Ooooooh. Yeah, I've been posting a fair bit in the past few days. 




 You do? What did I say or do for you to remember me? D: 




 Recommended, essential reading - I don't care! Gimmie!  




 I masturbated during my grandmother's funeral.

*Well.* 




 I'm not sure if I like bananas.. 




 As a Mancunian - I have no idea.

At least we're winning in something other than football! All we need now is Masturbation as an olympic sport, and we'll be champs. 




  I masturbated during my grandmother's funeral.

How the hell did you manage that..? 




 Fall in your dream. Wake up. Dangling from a rope god know how high up.

Pants wil be shat in. 




 Yes. I was in a LD for just under 2 years, and the times when we met were the best I ever had. I'm in England, she was in Belgium. Nothing like getting tacklehuggedkissed at the train platform. 




 There might be nanobots inside, be careful! We don't want another "Mummy" situation. 




 I have the client downloaded at home, and I made my account last night. I'm just wondering, is there a free trial period?

Also, I'm looking forward to playing. I haven't read much into it, as I signed up and downloaded last night on a whim after seeing a billboard ad on the way home from work 




 I should really get on more.. Steam Sales has me hooked again. Still only at ilvl 365, so I can't queue for LFR yet. 

Soon. 




 serious procrastination. if there's something I need to do, I'll put it off. Everything. Ever.

I should be working now 




 I'm coo' with it. I get back from work and it's a new bunch of games. :D 




 Graham Linehan was tweeting a few links. Caught me hook, line and sinker. 




 not widely used, but try posting this to /r/missingpersons too! 




 [Malukah - The Dragonborn Comes (and Skyrim Main Theme)](http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t rct=j q=malukah source=web cd=2 sqi=2 ved=0CC8QtwIwAQ url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D4z9TdDCWN7g ei=kmvuTuHmDcP08QOloZ2JCg usg=AFQjCNFDtSaSTtBGx8DlZwHNIj0ocdPoaA sig2=m1Ilolbz9jEL-4JH6MUzGw)

Coooool. 




 It's like a horrible car crash. It's horrible, but you gotta look at it. 




 There's a good amount of pony subreddits. A pretty daft amount, now I think about it. 

There's a subreddit for each character, the main sub, the NSFW sub, the sad sub, the stoner pony (stony) sub.. I could go on.

Maybe they're all posting at the same time. 




 There are some of the fans (myself included) who aren't pony nutcases, and I generally keep my pony antics in /r/mylittlepony, but there are always fans who let it leak a bit too much, though. 




 You're makin' that sound like a bad thing, Sugahcube.[](/squintyjack) 




 Aaaw! Why do BC's look so awesome when you put them in a neckerchief? 

I'm going to get one and see if mine will chill with it. 




 Okie-dokie-lokie, I'll drop you a PM with my address. 




 Cool! Do you wish to initiate the mailings, or shall I? 




 I have Skyrim already. :P 




 If it helps any, I'm English and I love visiting historical sites.

Should've said, really: I'd love to travel to far flung places, as well! I might jump in my car and visit a few of the English sites, and I'm definitely going to head to Ireland at some point. I've always wanted to visit Giant's Causeway 




 ISHYGDDT

(I seriously hope you guys don't do this.)
 




 Sure am! I'll drop you a PM with my e-mail 




 Whenever I go to the city centre, I usually park in a little car park just past Salford Central. Just off New Bailey Street, before it becomes Bridge Street

If you've got a satnav, put in Browncross Street. If not, when you go under the bridge with Salford Central, turn left down the side street just after Stephensons. 

Parked there a while back for a few quid, though it's a bit of a walk for the Arena.  




 I didn't get one..

:( 




 Indeed! I'll PM you my e-mail 




 I had a terrible time with Sky. The first month we had, we had fantastic speed, then for about 5 or 6 months after that, the speed we had was abysmal. I was lucky if I could download a 3 or 4 MB file within a few hours

I lost my temper with it so many times I ended up buying a 3G dongle 'til my dad saw sense with it. 




 Nokia.

I fell off the wagon and got an iPhone, then realised my mistake. I'm on my N8 now. Admittedly, Symbian is a pile of balls, but it makes phone calls, sends messages and lets me dick about on Reddit and Google+ just fine. 




 I lived on that for months. Had a horrible comedown. :( I'm a sucker for citrus energy drinks. 




 I think Youtube has issues with popular videos. It might stick at a number for a long time. 

Usually when I check it again a week later or something, It'll be (somewhat) accurate 




 Up for writing to anywhere, really! Get a grasp on how other people live their lives compared to mine.

I'm a bit of a technophile, and I love games and gaming in general. If I'm not working or gaming, I'll probably be lurking on the internet, or in the pub.  




 Unfortunately, I'm on the piss in Newcastle for the work's annual christmas do.

Maybe next time! 




 I have been swayed! I'm going to finish Skyrim tonight (I'm on the last quest for the main story now) and I shall resub tomorrow, maybe. 




 Aye, true. But still. xD I'll finish Skyrim and see if I can get back in the swing of things with my holycow 




 Picking up, huh? :) Might be tempted to resub, though I'm trying to kick my habit of playing games all day every day, and I've still got Skyrim to finish! 




 I was visiting Florida back in '04 and was in Orlando. After hearing many hurricane warnings, we headed back to the hotel (we were on a ground floor outside facing room), closed the windows and put a towel or 5 against the front door.

Slept straight though it. Totally missed it. As ol' blighty never gets any extreme weather, I was kinda gutted 




 At my desk at work. Bolton - England. 

Dullest town in England, I assure you. :P 




 Indeed you may!

Also, obligatory /r/tattoos subreddit plug. :D 




 Hah. Maybe. :P No rush, though! Don't go crazy on behalf of me. :P 

I'm a little broke at the moment, so I'm cutting back on stuff. WoW being one of them. 




 Fair enough! If you hit 85 before december, drop me a message - I'll come heal a dungeon or two for yous :D 




 I played for a little while - though I've gone off WoW recently. I've got a few days left of gametime, but then my sub runs out. If you're in the 85's, I'll come heal some dungeons for you, see if I still got it. :D 




 My lights are working a-ok, but you just reminded me that one of my Reverse lights are out.

I shall fiddle with it later, thanks for the reminder! :D 




 Not completely finished yet - Still need to get it coloured in.

Paul is an awesome artist, but his waiting list is huuuge! I'll try and get a clearer picture for when it's finished.

the dragon is a personal character of mine. [Jen Philpot](http://jocarra.deviantart.com) was the artist who drew the original picture. Paul modified it a little so it'd fit my arm
