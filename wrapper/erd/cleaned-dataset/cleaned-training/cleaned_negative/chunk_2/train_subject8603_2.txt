 Dumb and Dumberer was a prequel. He's talking about the sequel.  




 Had a really bad trip and experiencing an eternity in an unexpected hell. It felt like years had passed in a few moments. Also minutes before, having a girl narrate exactly what I was feeling as it was happening. Drugs are bad, kids.

 Very dreamlike.

 Am I the only person here who has read Uzumaki by Junji Ito? 




 I would imagine it going something like this. http://youtu.be/oolu-k3tY-g?t=45s 




 I was literally JUST thinking about making this comic. Made [this](http://i.imgur.com/PVxdX.jpg) earlier today before I even read your post. I start off by boiling about 1/2 a cup of water, adding only about 3 tbsp of natural peanut butter and adding garlic powder, sesame oil, soy sauce, and Sriracha, and when I'm feeling a little cheery, a bit of vodka. Its so god damn delicious. 




 Awesome! Totally worked this time. You are a god amongst men. 




 Not working D: 




 Oh god,  definitely. My roommate's girlfriend tried using it like any other cooking oil and she almost burned down our apartment. The smell was awful.  




 I use it in tons of different Asian style recipes. It's great for quickly adding a nutty sesame flavor, and is quite potent in a few drops. I also use it a lot for when I marinate stuff. 

Quick dipping sauce recipe for pot stickers and dumplings 
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 1/4 cup water
- few drops of sesame oil
- 1tsp of brown sugar 




 Definitely use a natural peanut butter over the kiddy sugary kind. I probably should edit that.  




 If you got it, by all means use it. The recipe works either way.  




 A few days covered in the fridge. Keep it in some tupperware and it should last you a week or so. If you make a really good batch, it shouldn't have to last that long ;D 




 Try some roasted red pepper. Maybe even throw in some sriracha. 




 My local grocery store's cheapest can of tahini is exorbitantly expensive at about $15 (even with a pretty good Arabic population) and might not be as easily found in some places. I also went through the supply I did buy rather quickly. It could be found online for pretty cheap, so I might just do that in the future and revise this recipe, but for now, this is a quick and dirty way to get hummus without having to pay too much for it at the grocery store. Its also far and away a better alternative then most recipes I see that don't use tahini. 




 I used unmixed, unsweetened peanut butter in this recipe. Using something like Jif or Peter Pan adds a little more sweetness, but I wouldn't go out of my way to add sugar to the hummus.  




 Its a pretty good approximation, especially if you use something similar to Naturally More peanut butter where you have to mix in the oils before you eat it. Something premixed like Jif or Peter Pan is going to have a lot more sugar and probably make your hummus sweeter, but not so much that its inedible. 




 I haven't tried it without. It might be totally fine, but that's how I've been making it and I think its supposed to add a nutty flavor. If you're allergic to peanuts, it might be worth seeking out actual tahini, but from experience, it does come at a premium.
