 I also like to eat steak with a salad folk.    




 What about me?   Can't I get at least two minutes of hate anymore?   I don't get [no respect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCVR_ajL_Eo).   






































































































































































































































































































































































































































































 Nothing beats Mossad's dental plan though.    They even cover cab rides to and from appointments.   




 [No respect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCVR_ajL_Eo)! 




 Come on, everyone knows you only got to be a moderator via magic powers.   You hypnotized people into making you a moderator.    

Just like me.  
 




 The guy from 60 Minutes I miss the most is Ed Bradley.   He was great.  




 With a side of butt hurt.  




 I'm /u/Bechus, and AL is /u/ProbablyHittingOnYou.    




 Team..... Can't they just use the proper name: Mossad Golem Project Ice Cream Foundation.     




 That guy is such a big old evil agent of Mossad.    I heard he ate a live baby once.   




 Dude, I'm just with Mossad.   To find out if Rito is an arm of the NSA you'll need to check with /u/Agentlame.   CIA can be contacted via /u/Karmanaut.    /u/Bipolarbear0 is the representative of the Walmart Agency.   




 I'm sorry, but shilling for a gaming company only gets you a T-shirt.    The hats are only for employees of intelligence services.    And our space lizard overlords.   




 For the record, I was [cast as Tyrion Lannister](http://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/24w9xh/nsapril_revolution_leader_uhonestduanes_shadowban/chbahp0?context=3) and I'm not giving that part up.    They can be Cersei, but she isn't really a member of House Lannister anymore, since she married Robert.  They're the weird people who sleep with their siblings.  
 




 Who would want to control such a place?   I have better things to do with my time.   Like root out spam infestations.   




 Let's get these things straight.   I work for Mossad.   /u/Agentlame is an NSA wunderkind.    

As if either of us would stoop to work for the crappy CIA.   Do we look like /u/Karmanaut?  




 All down votes for me are currently counting as up votes.  Thanks the counter measures built into Reddit.   So, thank you for your unwitting support.  




 Oh, I am sure the admins are on it.   As it is right now now...... all votes for me, regardless of their being up or down votes, currently count as up votes.  The more they down vote me, the more comment-karma I earn.  

It's kind of funny to watch.   




 We asked him to remove his Bird Mask.  After repeated requests we discovered the horrible truth: It's not a mask.   




 But, you're an evil /r/History moderator.  You would think that.    Oy vey.  




 I love /u/Agentlame too.   That guy is great.   He makes the best brownies for the /r/Food mod team pot luck breakfasts.   




 This is a useless discussion to have in that subreddit.   These are people who think everything is slavery and rape except for actual slavery and rape.   Which they are sure aren't all that bad really.  

Which means logical communication with them is inherently impossible.   




 That is a good idea.   I will look into maintaining a list. 




 I've added it to several subreddits I mod.  I was an early adopter of it.  It's a very decent tool.  




 Slaves do not get paid hundreds of thousands of dollars each year.   That's why Universal Health care is not slavery.     Slaves are not highly paid.    




 Probably just burning sulfur.  Nothing to worry about.  




 Thank you.  Added those to the list.   




 In /r/Cancer we see a lot of  phony "I'm sick, I need money" spam submissions.  To the point that we were forced to ban fund raising entirely.   99% of them are really spammers or scammers.     




 The subreddits I mod do a lot of that.     It's a good way to limit the impact of the spammers.   But they still need to be reported to /r/spam.    




 When you have a young subreddit, you have to submit a lot of content yourself.    Also mention is **when appropriate** in comments in other subreddits.    

* Advertise it via places like /r/newsubreddits and via a nicely worded one-time self-posts in related subreddits.   One-time means one-time.   If you do more than that, the mods of those subreddits may take offense and the users may start to think you are just being a jerk/spammer.   
* You can also politely ask other mod-teams to list you on their sidebar.  But sometimes they will say no.   Be gracious when they decline your request.  If they think your a jerk, then they may block you entirely. 
* Ask some users who you see submitting similar content elsewhere to also submit to your subreddit.   If you like them a lot, maybe ask them to be a mod.  

And continue to submit content to it. This is the most important thing.   The more stuff you submit, the more people may take notice of it.   If there is no new content, then even if somebody discovers it months later, they won't come back again.    




 Let's cut this on to the chase.

Question: Does believing the earth is 6000 years old make you "an idiot"?     

Answer:  Yes, it does.   




 You know Hitler and Elvis share a second floor walk up in Cleveland.  But they had to evict Jim Morrison for not paying his share of the rent.   




 So far reddit moderators are still going undetected by society-at-large.    The plan is working.    




 For our purposes it is the same picture.   Removed! 




 Yes, it is.  This repeat submission has been removed.  




 The Duggar family, even without all the weird religion and stuff, is still just weird.  To be honest, revelations like this about a family of 19 kids.... not a huge surprise.   These are very weird people.  

Throw in the very, very Mormon beliefs, the TV show, the extreme right wing politics, and it all was bound to spin out of control into something very bad.     I don't know if it could have been prevented with all that crazy spinning all around.   




 Are you the Warl.....  Hummm.... might kill me like a Warlizard.  Never mind.   




 I'm sorry, but this submission has been removed.  This is a repeat submission of this top-200 post:

Thank you. 
 




 I am pretty sure I threw cannon balls.  




 I went threw counting the zero-day-old accounts.  I am sure I got them.  




 Bans have been handed out to the god-damned dirty rotten spammer ++++.
