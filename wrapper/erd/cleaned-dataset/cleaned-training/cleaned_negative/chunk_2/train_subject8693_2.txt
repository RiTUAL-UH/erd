 Why in the fuck do people think quoting themselves is a classy thing to do? Its asinine.

 I will wear my crown with honor, while I sip on the tears of homeless orphans. 




 If I had the means to care for them, I'd dognap all of them...their just too damn cute! 




 This breaks my heart. 




 I'm happy to help, just hit me up whenever you've got a question and I'll help as much as I can :) 




 Happy to help :) 




 I think body spray would work, just use as little as possible on your hands. a bath would probably work in the same way, I just don't know how long after the bath their natural odors would return. Which I think is why my vet told me to try the cologne/perfume/spray route first, because it completely masks their natural scents for a good amount of time. you may also need to do it for a few days, but once a day only. my two fought like hell when I first introduced them, and I did it for I think 2-3 days. the fighting gradually toned down and they became best friends :)

I'd suggest cleaning the cage too, help remove some of the male's scent. Don't worry about toys and stuff that aren't washable, they shouldn't be too big of a problem. But if you want, try and remove them after you neutralize their scents, and put the toys back after a couple days. Make up for the lack of stimulation by handling them more, both at the same time. I did the same with mine. 




 Something that worked for me when I introduced a new friend to my little man, is to put a dab of cologne or perfume on your hand and pet them both. the tiniest amount possible and rub it over both hands. it neutralizes both scents and helps ease them into spending time together. 




 I love you Mr. Burgundy. 




 Pity your parent's didn't feel the same way.

 




 I blame the children in my basement.

That's what everyone calls it... 




 Many thanks. *Bows*  




 The whole point of a quote is something someone said in the moment, that others find significance with. You can't quote yourself, this is embarrassing. Posting this confirms with everyone that your a degenerate cock-weasel sporting a trilby.

 Imagine how the little girl feels. 




 *Long Hard Road out of Hell* is amazing. 




 Jeffrey Dahmer and his mother are sitting down to a home-cooked meal at his place. 

**Mom**- *"Jeff, I don't much care for your friends"* **Jeffrey**- *"Than just eat the vegetables ma."* 




 I'll take that as a compliment. :) 









 In Jenna Jameson's autobiography she mentions that Manson is "well endowed" after hooking up with him after the premiere of Howard Stern's *Private Parts*. 




 Yeah, but once you get his routine down pat and had the necessary accoutrements, Sephiroth became an experience horse you could beat over and over for dem sweet level-ups. 




 I opened the gofundme account because I saw someone else use it and I wasn't sure how to go about the business of accepting help from people online.

What exactly is suspicious about my post? Honestly? I said something that went against the flow of the thread. Do you value heard mentality that much on this sub? 




 On the plus side, he's got a child-free future ahead of him with which to perfect his craft with. 




 You wasted you're roommates money by spoiling their food, but you think its completely fine to come on here and ask someone else to put up more money for something that is supposed to be a gift? You're on here looking for a hand-out when being stupid is the reason you have no food, possibly pulling chances away from other people here who may not have a damn thing to eat. People who are looking toward the generosity of others to fill their stomachs as well as their hearts.

You are a dick. 




 Lucifer. 




 What? No cutesy little response back to show me how your the king or some shit? How your ideals give you some untold keen insight into the universe? How you stand alone in a dwindling majority against all the baddies you need to justify your "life"? 




 What does that have to do with anything? Or did you just take the most personal thing from my history and decide to post it for shits and giggles? Discussion or stupid insults are one thing, Throwing the fact my family isn't well off in my face is another all together. 




 I feel like, given all the work they did on the rest of her...those claws seem poorly built.  




 Excellent repost OP. I was gonna offer to put my dick up your ass, but I can see you used your own. Impressive. 




 Not trying to be a fuddy-duddy. But that is not OCD in any way, shape, or form. People who have it sometimes find it aggravating how nonchalantly its thrown around, like its no big deal. When its considered the 5th most debilitating mental disorder. 




 While your in flight your least favorite song plays in your head. The longer you fly, the louder it gets and the slower it plays.

 This is the greatest thing I've ever seen on Reddit, I tell you what. 




 I'd love to talk with you. 




 Fuck that's dark.
