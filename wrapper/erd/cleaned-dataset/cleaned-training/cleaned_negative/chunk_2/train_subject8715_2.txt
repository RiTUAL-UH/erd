 I posted this last night, but it was so late that I didn't really get a response.

10 Team 1pt PPR
Trade Away: Percy Harvin
Receive: Alshon, Reggie Bush

I'm just wary of Harvin's durability and I like Alshon better long-term.

His Alshon for my Harvin

I know Alshon isn't playing well right now, but I feel better about him long term. Thoughts? 




 WR 2 is definitely my big weakness, but no one is biting on a trade. Just have to ride it out I guess.

Thanks!

WR and the flex are definitely a problem for me. I left a few players off here because I'm working the waiver wire tomorrow.

I have two flex spots to figure out this week. Candidates are Doug Martin, Bernard Pierce, Kelvin Benjamin, and Greg Jennings.

Pierce had a solid week, but obviously the other three did not... 




 It's a Wonderful Life. It's a beautiful movie and it is one of the few "classic" movies that nearly everyone will watch and love because of its charm.
