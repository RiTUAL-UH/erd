 Or in the future 2016, 2017, 2018.  




 Hobbies, Interests, ect.  




 Just curious.  




 Just wondering.  




 Little Talks, Mountain Sound, Your Bones by Of Monsters and Men  




 But it's beyond humiliating.  




 What emotion and which scene or scenes did this for you?

 True thanks  




 "You're spreading negative vibes." 




 Movies by myself  




 Ashy space dust  




 I wrote a large scale film in the form of a treatment but other than that no shorts with friends.  




 To be a great filmmaker  




 An in depth plot summary of a film.  




 Random, but Terrance Howard, he just seems like a down to earth guy that you can trust. Since I know him personally and everything :p not really.  




 What Lies Beneath (2000) 




 A treatment I wrote for a huge blockbuster trilogy, wish I could get it seen or on the front page :/  




 Filming of The Lord of the Rings 




 Justin Bieber, he gets a lot of shit for just being him but what has he done to earn that? Making music some people don't like is the biggest reason people don't like him.  




 It's alright, nothing greaaat. The movie Signs is very alien if you haven't seen that. I consider that one great.  




 Extraterrestrial (2014) was an adventure movie with a shocking ending, and Dark Skies (2013) was suspenseful. Both about aliens.   




 I want to be a great filmmaker, so we'll see ~ 




 I love dogs and I hate having to have a job. Wish I was traveling.  




 Social skills. 




 What Happens in Vegas, for some reason that movie is just silly and gets me laughing.
