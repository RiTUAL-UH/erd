 Its kinda lame they re-used so many stuff from the other trailer.

Still hyped though! 




 Well, that is the least touched game on my desktop i think, and i have only played a few PvP's. So i can't really tell if it's pay to win. 

It's pretty fun though, but i prefer the old aoe (:

everything besides sc2 casually though. 




 AHWWWW man, I LOVE SC2!!! 




 This series is soooo nerve wrecking 0__o 




 are there any vods anywhere? (:
 




 Yo buddy, caps lock button is right above the shift key on the left. 




 I DON'T KNOW KEV! 




 well that took a nosedive 




 Darn, missed it, can i watch a vod somewhere? (:
EDIT: already found it, thank you for casting that! hope you liked it (:
oh and you pronounced my name really funny but no worries, the 'oe' sounds doesn't exist in English(: 




 may i ask why you made this?  




 Submitted mine!  




 This is from quite a while ago, and it is embarrasing to watch for me now, but i think this was the closest game in my still short SC2 career, hope you like it (:
