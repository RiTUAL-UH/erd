 I watched the first episode of the season and the second made no sense. So I looked at the order of episodes on the wiki and it's completely different from Netflix. 

Edit: I'm also down a few drinks so sorry for the grammar.  









 I really want an open air truck but the broncos are too expensive, the wranglers are too common, and there aren't any clean scouts around these parts. Is there any other type of open truck?  









 What did he do to you? I know that he spreads the party school rep, but that doesn't really seem like enough for most people I've talked to to dislike him.  














 The weight room in my high school has an assisted pull up machine. I have never seen one of those before in my life. Have I just not been looking hard enough or is it a rarity?  














 So yesterday I was weightlifting and one of the guys I was lifting with wanted me to do deadlifts. The form he showed me felt off but I went with it, legs straight and at shoulder width back bent when picking up the weight. After a few reps I felt a twinge on the lower right side of my back, initially I didn't realize what it was because it wasn't excessively painful, but I soon stopped when I realized ehat was happening. Since then I've had sort of a dull soreness in that lower right area of my back. I can't really feel it when I'm standing or lying flat on my back. Yesterday it seemed to go away when I was taking a hot shower. I really don't want to deal with a doctor but I also really don't want to screw up my back permanently. I know for certain that I won't use anymore free weights or do back exercises until I've researched proper form.

**tl;dr** Was deadlifting with straight legs and bent back yesterday and felt slight twinge. Today I have a sort of dull pain on the right side of my lower back that goes away when standing or lying flat. What do I do?

**edit**

I did a sort of stretching exercise and if I lift my knee so thet it's at a 90 degree angle while my body is turned to the right of my waist then when I put it down I feel a popping in my back.  









 My only riding experience is the MSF course. I was just offered a great deal on an FZ6 but I'm worried that it might be too much bike. I am a big guy, ~260 lbs so I have been looking for something bigger than a 250. My other options are an SV650 naked, and a ninja 500. I know the SV650 is tame for a 650 so I'm not as worried about grabbing too much throttle and launching myself to my death. 









 I really want to watch Common Law which aired for one season during the summer of 2012. It's a USA show so I'm surprised that it's not on instant.  


































 I've got two pairs of prescription ray ban sunglasses and now I need a non script pair for when I wear contacts, not looking to spend another $200. 



















 I'm visiting SoCal and it seems like every other driver is looking at their damn phone, nobody signals their lane changes, everybody is going a good 10-20 mph over the limit, and there is debris everywhere. Holy fucking Jesus this place is insane. I feel bad for you CA riders. I could not ride here.

/rant. 









 We're staying about an hour south of SB but I'm going to go check out SBCC this week. Our entire group is coming. What can two high school seniors and four middle aged parents do in SB for a day? 









 How's it ride? How hard is it to build?  Is it comfortable for longer rides? 


[For those that don't know what I'm talking about](http://www.rycamotors.com) 














 So I saw some scratches on my car today located below the driver's side headlight.

http://imgur.com/a/eN8rO#0

I don't know what did it. There have always been scratches there, but I'm not sure if they were that bad. I feel like if I was hit/sideswiped at some point,  or conversely,  scratched someone else unknowingly then I there would be scratches above those. I do tend to pull forward pretty far when I park so it could be damage from a bush but I'm not sure. Any ideas? 
























 Are aviators and wayfarers still cool? 









 I'll be moving soon for college. The campus is sketchy to say the least... There are at least two days out of the year that I know for a fact I won't be able to keep my bike on campus, and there's still a lot of vandalism and theft and shit year round. Have any of you used a storage unit as a garage? I want to at least be able to take the bike out on weekends. I don't see why there would be any problems, but before I try to figure out the logistics I'd like r/motorcycle's opinion. 




 I'm not looking for anything difficult. Just looking for swooping curves and straights to really open the car up on. Preferably out in the country.  









 I had a Facebook friend "come out" as a polygamist today. He had recently been married but they got divorced. He is now in a relationship with a couple he met online.  



















 I tried to watch Dallas, the remake of the show about the oil family, and I made it about halfway through the first season before I gave up. My mistake may have been trying to binge it, but it felt like it was just dragging on and a bit overly dramatic. Should I give it another try?

 So I'll be attending a CCC in fall with the goal of transferring to a UC and becoming a resident. My parents will be sending me the maximum amount of money possible without claiming me as a dependent so that I can pay off tuition and housing. Now, my question is, once I become a resident can they claim me as a dependent again without putting me in danger of losing my in state tuition or residency?  




 I'm 18 and have about 100 lbs to lose, but the thought of having saggy skin for the rest of my life concerns me. I'm going to lose the weight regardless because that's a bigger issue, but as long as I'm at the very beginning stages of weight loss, are there any preventative measures I can take? I know I should take it slow, but I also want to lose as much as possible before college starts in august. 














 We've been debating for about 15 minutes now. I say no, he says yes, and the internet seems undecided. Unfortunately we're not able to test our respective hypotheses at the moment.  



















 I've never really understood it because nobody is actively promoting rape or saying it's ok, and rarely do people defend rapists. But the term "rape culture" implies (to me) that most of society is actively promoting, committing,  and defending rape. 




 I really wanted to go to a mid-top tier UC as a freshman, but alas it proved to be too hard to do as an out of state applicant. I have made the decision to attend SBCC and attempt to transfer to UCSB, USC, UCLA, or any other solid California school. In an attempt to squeeze the most enjoyment out of my few years of higher education I have also decided to stay in a private dorm (Tropicana Gardens). My concern is that I was going through some posts regarding SBCC on this sub, and it seems like SBCC students are discriminated against. Apparently they are even forced to wear a wrist band to get into Isla Vista (wtf? I didn't realize that IV is a gated community). Will being a CC student cause me much grief? I'm mainly going to SBCC so that I can transfer into a good school, but I'd be lying if I said that stuff like Deltopia didn't help me make my choice. I don't want to get kicked out of parties or hassled for being a CC student. So, what's the deal? Will I be able to live happily alongside you guys? 




 So I'm going to be visiting SB with my parents during spring break to check out Isla Vista, SBCC, and downtown SB. I'm looking for a place where I can rent a scooter or a small motorcycle so that I can kind of explore without my parents. The only place that comes up on google is Moto Loco, but their website doesn't seem to confirm that they rent any motorized two wheeled vehicles. Any ideas? 




 It is one of the best war documentaries that I have ever seen. It's as powerful as Restrepo. The premise is that a tight knit group of childhood friends enlist in the National Guard together. They are deployed to Afghanistan in 2008. The movie starts with them preparing for their deployment, but by far the most powerful part is that they interview the family members as well as the soldiers during their deployment. Finally, it follows their transition back into society and their struggle with PTSD. It'll make you want to cry, it'll make you want to laugh, and it'll make you angry.  

















































 So there's a really cool tour company located in Hawaii that I'm very interested in working at for a summer. A youtuber that I follow is friends with the owner and he is frequently featured in videos. I wouldn't work as a tour guide obviously, but if I sent him a resume with my qualifications and said that I'd be willing to do any job for near minimum wage, do you think I would get a response?

A bit about me, I'm in college and my work experience is limited. I'm studying business/marketing. 














 I was talking to a Hawaiian friend and he was complaining thaf nobody sells spam musubi here. Now I want to try it. 









 So I'm wondering if these are symptoms of depression and/or anxiety. [I posted a related question here yesterday](http://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1y1mg7/can_depression_cause_you_to_blur_or_confuse/)

So about six months ago a thought popped into my head. I won't say what it is because it makes me uncomfortable. Basically the thought was, what if I'm a (x)? From there it started spiraling out of control.  I couldn't get the idea that I'm a (x) out of my head. At first it was no big deal, but eventually whenever I started planning for my future (college, after college, etc) the thought would pop into my head and I would tell myself that I couldn't do the things I want to do for fear that I'm a (x) and won't be able to control myself. That made me sad, but I pushed on. Around two months ago (when i was at the peak of my depression) I had a horrible intrusive thought related to the idea that I'm a (x). Basically in reality the course of events went one way, but the intrusive thought took them another way. However, in the past day or so I haven't been able to separate the two in my memory. Consciously I know that one is false and the other is true,  but something in me keeps trying to convince me that the intrusive thought is reality,  which it is not. It's really messing with my head. 

I decided to test this problem I have with keeping reality and my thoughts separate. Minor stuff was easy. If I told myself that on Monday I went out to lunch with John when in reality I went with James, could always pick out the lie. Same with very major stuff like when I tried to convince myself that I didn't get a traffic ticket two years ago. But there were some things that happened anywhere from two months to two years ago that I consciously know which one is the truth and which is the lie, but something in me says otherwise. 


**TL; DR** 

Consciously I can separate truth from reality,  but somethinv between my conscious and my subconscious is trying to convince me that something I imagined is reality. 









 I suspect I have depression. I plan on getting checked or tested or whatever, but something peculiar has been happening to me recently. I seem to be mixing a memory with an intrusive thought that happened at the same time (a month and a half ago) as the event I'm remembering. Now, I know which one happened and which one was the intrusive thought, but they're slowly becoming less separate and I fear that if this continues that I wont be able to distinguish them in 5, 10, 20 years from now. Now, the event in question happened during a two week span in which I was more depressed than I had ever felt in my life. Like I was seriously fucked up. I had a lump in my throat the whole time, intrusive thoughts were happening multiple times a day, I was nervous the entire time, I nearly had panic attacks. It was the first time I had ever thought to myself "Fuck... I need to get help". I was even crying when I was by myself which is very unusual for me. Now, my second question is, once I'm on meds, or my depression is gone, will it be easier to distinguish memories? One of the reasons I'm sure that I have depression is that I'm only 18, yet all of my memories have been blurring together. Like on thursday I couldn't remember whether several events had happened on monday, tuesday, or wednesday.

 I've never been baptized or anything like that either. 





























 Tell me about the time you went dancing with the green fairy. 














 I've never owned a motorcycle but I've been wanting one for a while. Accidental broadcast has convinced me that owning a DS would be the bee's knees. I've got no more than 2750 to spend. Is there anything that's smaller than 500cc, reliable, and fun in that price range? I'm looking to do ~80% commuting and 20% trail, sand, forest type exploring. 

There's a '99 WR400F on Craigslist in my price range if you think that's worth getting.  









 Their [Ninja Cafe Racer Kit](http://bluecollarbobbers.com/kawasaki-ninja-250-cafe-racer-aka-gpx-250r) intrigues me. How is the quality and ease of installation? 






















































 In the past if two countries were going to war with each other it was very easy for the respective Gov'ts to spread propaganda that demonizes the other country and it's citizens. Today I communicate with Europeans, Asians, and South Americans on reddit every day. I predict that most if not all of the wars involving first world countries for the rest of civilization as we know it will be fought against insurgents and disconnected third world countries. 









 I usually listen to the KNRQ morning show on 103.7 but lately I've been wanting to mix it up.  I don't really care about the music,  at least in the morning, I mainly listen for the banter. 









 She still doesn't think it's a good idea, but she agrees that squids inflate the crash data. [The findings can be found here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_findings_in_the_Hurt_Report)

Some interesting points:

23) Motorcycle riders with previous recent traffic citations and accidents are overrepresented in the accident data.

24) The motorcycle riders involved in accidents are essentially without training; 92% were self-taught or learned from family or friends. Motorcycle rider training experience reduces accident involvement and is related to reduced injuries in the event of accidents.

27) Almost half of the fatal accidents show alcohol involvement.

35) Motorcycle riders in these accidents were significantly without motorcycle license, without any license, or with license revoked.

43) Seventy-three percent of the accident-involved motorcycle riders used no eye protection.

44) Approximately 50% of the motorcycle riders in traffic were using safety helmets but only 40% of the accident-involved motorcycle riders were wearing helmets at the time of the accident.

55) Less than 10% of the motorcycle riders involved in these accidents had insurance of any kind to provide medical care or replace property. 







































 I started a circlejerk. Damn you, Reddit.

 The term "mass shooting" has become synonymous with aimless killing, usually involving schools, or someone firing into a crowd. But I've noticed that recently many shootings that would have been reported on as gang violence five years ago are being called mass shootings. The same goes for murders perpetrated in a public place.  









 Victor Pride from [Bold and Determined](http://boldanddetermined.com/) does a great job of introducing people to nootropics, or life hacks as he calls them. He does an especially good job of [introducing people to Modafinil](http://boldanddetermined.com/2012/07/12/become-mighty-modafinil/). Here's the issue, he makes it seem like using nootropics, especially modafinil, will turn you into a Greek God capable of taking on armies and solving the riddles of the universe. He makes it seem like if you pop some modafinil today, then tomorrow you'll wake up as a billionaire. The issue is that when Victor Pride tells some kid that using Modafinil is going to be like using NZT-48, and it isn't, that kid is either going to tell everyone and their mother that nootropics are modern day snake oil, or he's going to try something stronger, like a high dose of adderall. I think that while he introduces people to nootropics, he is ultimately going to cause harm to the nootropics community. You've heard *my* opinion on the matter, but I'm genuinely curious to know what you think. I'm also curious to know if you think newcomers should be warned about him. 




 I've been saving up for a while now to get my first bike. I really want a WR250R, but they are so expensive used that I think I might just get another bike and trade it in when I get more funds. I found this Buell Blast:

http://www.cycletrader.com/listing/2009-Buell-Blast-110572701

I like the looks of the bike and I've come to the realization that I won't have any use for a D/S until I move to California in nine months, so maybe a street bike is just what I need. My concerns with the Buell is that they've been discontinued so parts will become scarcer and scarcer, I'm not sure how easy it is to get them serviced, and I'm not sure if it's as good a first bike as say a Ninja 300 or 500 or a CBR250R. I'd like your thoughts on the matter though. Buy this and ride it while I save up for a WR250R or just wait until I can afford the bike I want? 




 My evidence:

- The Mother has never been referred to in present tense by the narrator

- Whenever future Ted talks about her he sounds kind of sad. Definitely the whimsical, romantic Ted we've come to know and love.

- The last episode is titled "Last Forever"

- At the end of the last episode Ted makes a comment to the mother. "Nothing good happens after 2 AM (future Ted then interjects to say to his son, "except for you, luke)" before they set off to the hospital. After 2 AM.

- The producers decided on the ending early on. No matter how much they changed the plot around it wouldn't mess with an ending that results in her death.

- at the end of the "Time Travelers" episode Ted is seen pleading for more time with the mother. He wants 45 more days.

- The mother never narrates.

- She is never in any flash forward beyond 10 years or so. 




 Hey all! I'm new to this sub, but we recently had a men's rights victory at my school that I felt like sharing. My school has a daycare center that students are allowed to volunteer at. They receive credit for volunteering and if they do it for more than two semesters they become a paid employee. In the years prior to this school year, male student volunteers were not allowed to change diapers or escort the kids to the bathroom, even the boys. One of the male students saw the inequality in this and petitioned the parents of the daycare children to allow male students to change diapers and escort kids to the bathroom. He succeeded! 





























 Especially when it comes to things you wouldn't think to look up when driving in another state. Like lane splitting in CA or no right on red in NY. 




 I did it today but I'm starting to think it was illegal. Here's a drawing I made if the turn:
