 Because I think he's an utter turd as a director. He hasn't made a good movie let alone a great one. Clerks was okay at the time, but trying to watch that again recently was painful. I didn't really like Chasing Amy, I thought it had a few funny bits but was very pretentious...and the rest of his catalogue looks like one piece of shit after another. A lot of my friends agree, but he definitely has an audience he's tapped into who think he's really great. Can anyone explain??
