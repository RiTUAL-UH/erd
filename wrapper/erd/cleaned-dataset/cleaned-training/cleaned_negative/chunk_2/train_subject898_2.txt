 Don't take medication. It'll just create a need for it in your body that will increase your anxiety in the long run. Just pray, serve, be with people and exercise if you can. Realize that everything in your life is in the hands of Christ. Be Still And Know That I Am God.

 I believe in Christ and I can't go very many minutes without thinking about Him. But I just wanted to say, this weekend my coworkers have invited me to a tailgate where everyone seems to intend on getting drunk, and I think I will too. There also may be marijuana of which I will partake as well. I'm telling you all this because I really do believe in the Salvation of Jesus but I feel that I often times am on highs and lows, times where I am obedient and times where I openly disobey God. Please don't attack, but help me understand. Am I not saved? Being up and down like this? I just don't know what to say really.

 Yeah, GTA V's audience is far more expansive than CoD's. They might have been able to do a fraction of GTA's sales if they didn't pump out copypastas every year. Rockstar actually cares about their audience. Hence why they've never had an article written on them about trying to break sales records. That should come in hindsight if you really care about your audience.

 I feel that every iteration of whatever racing series (Forza Motorsport, Gran Turismo etc.) all demo the amazing amount of detail put into the car models, yet they completely neglect some of the most fun parts of racing games - crashes. 

You have games such as Burnout that focus on that part of racing, yet it is on a grand end of the spectrum of racing games and takes a common part of cars and places it to the highest level. As entertaining as it is, it would be enjoyable to see what other game developers are capable of in the realm of car crashes and overall vehicle physics.

You have independent games such as [Beam NG](http://www.beamng.com/content/) that are experimenting with the limits of car destruction simulation and real time automobile malleability, which is exciting, novel and fresh. The only thing that comes as a shock is why more racing game developers haven't researched technology such as this and brought racing simulation to new level beyond current damage models. In some ways, when I play a racing game without realistic crashes, it's like playing a football game without tackles.  




 Tradition 




 I totally feel that. I felt like the maps were more open and the kills very satisfying. Twas the only multiplayer game that I played that I was totally satisfied with playing alone.  




 I've also got something funny to say....somewhere around here... 




 Who are these people, and how do you plan on differentiating them as you drop said bombs?

 In all honesty, these pics seem about right. Propaganda is not exclusive to every other country that isn't the United States. American soldiers are just as susceptible, if not, more so likely, to do some fucked up shit, just like every other human being. Down with the machine!

 I hate how everything in our society is so hypocritical. Bad things happen everyday, people say fuck and shit and niggerfaggot alike, yet our media will run an entire story about a celebrity or coach who uses profanity as if they opened fire at a god damned navy yard. The News is owned and blatantly retarded, yet all these nursing homes hobos won't stop letting it overflow their grey matter.  




 Sheep up Wakel! 




 why the fuck would you trust the government? are you deaf and blind? at least you can copy paste wiki pages. 




 why didn't they just let us do it in the first place? since the register gives out cash anyway?

 0.3.0.3 update was released on the 4th of September and I didn't know if it automatically updated or I had to download a patch through the game or external website? 




 I find death animations to be oddly distracting and repetitive. Is there a way to turn them off and use only ragdoll?  




 How do you think it should occur? All opinions are welcome. 














 I pray, I believe, I forgive, I read my Bible. I don't always go to church. I work full time as a nurse at a hospital. I work second shift and spend most of my time either sleeping, working, and free time late at night. My nights after work usually involve being with friends, or playing video games at home. I still struggle with pornography and various other daily sins that sometimes I do commit, and sometimes don't commit. I ask forgiveness and attempt to move forward. I just don't really know what I'm doing with my life anymore, because it seems like now that I'm working, time is flying by so fast. I feel like I've accomplished nothing for the Kingdom of Christ, other than trying to represent Him the best I can at work, I suppose. I don't get to see the body of Christ very often, and lately I've just been wondering if I am even fully following Christ. I just don't really know what to say or do anymore... 




 my origin name is JoelTheTroll  - add me or PM me if you want to play. I'm just getting started on PC and would love some friends to get started with, especially starting BF4 soon. I also need some advice on which mic setup to get. Thanks :) 



















 It works fine once you set it as primary in singleplayer but once i get to multiplayer it turns off at the beginning of a match and i have to unplug and plug it back in and i just don't get what is happening? 














 I purchased the game but have no idea really how to update or do much of anything technical. help? 














 I know this is probably posted a million times but I could use some prayers. I struggle with pornography and I just don't understand how to completely overcome it. There will be periods of time where I'll go on without doing it and I'll convince myself that it is gone forever, then temptation comes at me even harder, and I fall. I pray. I meditate. I even attempted to deliver myself from an unclean spirit that I thought may be hindering me (of which I'm still uncertain) and I can only ever last for maybe 2 weeks at the maximum. I want to overcome this because I want to show God that I'm ready for a serious relationship with him and possibly a wife, if he'll permit it. But I feel so held back. I feel accused by it, and then I feel weak. I turn to Jesus and know that  I am redeemed but I always feel like I'm such a let down to Jesus. I very much want to cleanse myself of this so that I can show God I'm ready and mature. But I suppose all I can ask for is prayers.  




 This is a very general, basic question...answer individually as you deem true.

But, I'll give you a specific example of my life...I am a new nurse at my local hospital and there is a particular female that I have began to find very attractive. Her outer beauty of course. But her personality is just so boisterous and exuberant. She is just a fantastic joy to listen to and a very positive energy. And I think what created the greatest attraction was when she would openly talk about Jesus in such a confident manor amidst fellow employees. The only unfortunate part is that, though our interactions have been positive and a possible chemistry is there, I feel that our jobs are so busy. We hardly have time to truly create a foundational friendship. This leaves me in a very silly situation. Logic tells me, don't be moronic and rushingly ask her out before you really know her and end up looking like a fool. But instinct tells me, if I wait too long and don't establish some sort of relationship, I will miss my chance and regret it. I'm not sure what to say really, because I know my issue is really a generally mild topic. I'm just at a strange point in my life where I have begun my career and it takes up a majority of my time, and I feel that my primary time to mingle will be in my work environment and I truly would enjoy having someone to share my life with. I know I'm probably wayyyy over thinking it, but I have no idea how to approach this situation, or if I should even give it a second thought. An odd duality of all or nothing. Maybe you can Pray that God give me a clear mind? 




 The Bible tells us that there's a constant war going on around us. A war that involves the spiritual heavenly hosts and principalities of darkness. I personally feel that this says so much in regards to the Christian faith. I feel that this says so much more than just going to church every Sunday and putting on a smile for our white suburban brothers at a midweek bible study. The bible is essentially saying there are beings that have existed, spiritually, in our world, or realm, for an uncounted number of lifetimes. The beings have seen nation rise and nation fall. These beings are the ultimate researchers on the human condition and can predict what you're going to do before you even decide that you will do it. Some of these creations have even sat at the foot of God's throne.
I suppose where my issue is, is in my own life. I, like many Christians, battle against Sin and the world daily. I pray. I read the Bible. I try to represent Christ the best I can. I fail many times. I know there is much more going on in our world than just what we see with our eyes and speak with our mouths. But at times, I wonder if I will ever truly understand or partake in this supernatural battle that rages on. I'm a nurse at a hospital who helps people daily, sure, but its still just a job at times. I then proceed home and fiddle on my computer and maybe be with friends. It's a relatively monotonous life, that has been replicated one billion times over in many other countries and timelines. 

I guess my biggest question is: Can I expect to experience God on a supernatural level, the kind that changes lives, or is my meandering lifestyle going to hold me back from truly seeing what I know is out there until the day my soul leaves body? 




 Wonder, Miracle, Beauty movies?  Suggest your favorite, if you'd be so kind.  
























 It truly is a fascinating piece of literature that fits within Biblical canon and timeline. It covers interesting topics such as End Times, detail on Fallen Angels interbreeding with human woman - creating giants (Nephilim mentioned in Genesis 6:4 and in Daniel, of whom were a primary cause of God's Flood) - and also covering "The Just One", commonly perceived as Christ. Below are also some references towards Enoch in the Bible. 

**Hebrews 11:5** - 5 By faith Enoch was taken from this life, so that he did not experience death: He could not be found, because God had taken him away. For before he was taken, he was commended as one who pleased God.

**Genesis 4:17-18** - 17 Cain made love to his wife, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch. Cain was then building a city, and he named it after his son Enoch. 18 To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael was the father of Methushael, and Methushael was the father of Lamech.

**Genesis 5:18-19** - 18 When Jared had lived 162 years, he became the father of Enoch. 19 After he became the father of Enoch, Jared lived 800 years and had other sons and daughters.

**Genesis 5:21-24** - 21 When Enoch had lived 65 years, he became the father of Methuselah. 22 After he became the father of Methuselah, Enoch walked faithfully with God 300 years and had other sons and daughters. 23 Altogether, Enoch lived a total of 365 years. 24 Enoch walked faithfully with God; then he was no more, because God took him away.

**1 Chronicles 1:3** - 3 Enoch, Methuselah, Lamech, Noah.

**Luke 3:37** - 37 the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch,

the son of Jared, the son of Mahalalel,

the son of Kenan,


What are you thoughts as to why it was not included in The Bible?

 And why do people hate it? 
























 I ask this because, the majority of the time we come across something related to secret societies, such as the Illuminati, they are presented as a "Satanic" group and oppose the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth. Since the majority of the users in here are in opposition to this group, can I ask if your beliefs align with the Christian Theology?

Edit: Interesting that there is a lot of anti "religion" perspectives. Understandable. But when you examine the four Gospels and the example Jesus set within that narrative, some will note that Jesus too was against meaningless religion. He despised the Pharisees that had manipulated Judaism at that time for their own personal gain. It appears that what Jesus really came to do was demonstrate and create a way for individuals to be in direct communion with God. Jesus was liberating the people from religion and leading them to relationship and faith. When examining the source documents of the accounts with Jesus, one can immediately identify a paradoxical teaching that is prevalent between what Jesus said and what some modern religious establishments teach. In a way, The Illuminati, or Satan, would actually support the binding and legalism that some current "Christian" groups hold over there followers. While Satan has infiltrated religion, he fears the masses beginning to understand the relationship that can be had with God through Jesus.  









 What is its context? Why is it so harsh? Does it apply to modern day followers? 









 I think hearing about some people's low points in their faith or before they found Christ and how they bounced back through the power of Christ would encourage a lot of people who at times don't feel worthy of God's Love. But of course, God's Love is ever extending :) 




 I'm incredibly excited for GTA V coming out but I also feel as if though I shouldn't be and give up games all together. Any thoughts? 




 I have accepted Christ as my Lord and savior many years ago, but as many do, I have some questions. Lately, when I spend way too much time on Youtube, I get a really mixed message on Salvation. 

I watch these [videos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYINqTN1SBw) that tend to make me feel as if though I still am condemned, even after years of walking with Christ. I obviously haven't been perfect, and it's a daily struggle. But I just need some clarification on the life that Jesus excepts from me. When I watch these videos, it often times makes me terrified that I'm not doing enough. 

I've always been taught that Grace trumps the Law, but lately I'm feeling very condemned by the message of Law that's being presented. 

My life consists of working at a retirement home and daily reading my scriptures and praying. I still struggle with various sins and I just don't know what to think anymore. I am constantly bombarded with the message that I haven't done enough but also the message that only through Christ's sacrifice are we sufficient before God. When I come across opportunities to talk to people about Jesus, I do. Should I be doing more? Should I leave the working world? I feel condemned and I just need truth and encouragement.

TL;DR - I'm getting mixed messages 



















 I'm surprised more games don't use the awesome [Euphoria Animation System](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6F3lT1v79I) that can be seen in games like Max Payne 3 and Star Wars: The Force Unleashed. With the repetition that comes with seeing the same death animations in games like Call of Duty through the use of Motion Capture, you would think that more development studios would utilize the novelty and variety of Euphoria Animation. It's one of the primary reasons I always looked forward to most of the recent iterations in the Rockstar franchise. The level of visceral movement that is procedurally generated from the Euphoria engine leaves me wanting more after every experience and I would love to see how it will shape this generation and next generation games' animation development. Thoughts?

 The Year: 2064

 

Grandpa walks into the living room to see his 6 year old grandson is laughing, laying prone in front of some sort of handheld gaming device while his

eyes are in REM. (Rapid Eye Movement)

 

"Hey buddy whaddya playin there?", asks grandpa looking at his grandson in confusion

 

 

Grandson quickly comes out of his REM and looks at his grandpa cheerfully and replies, "My Nintendo Synfesis Gwandpa!" With a lisp :) (Nintendo Synthesis)

 

 

Grandpa's confusion quickly subsides with a smile of relief and replies, "ohhh, Nintendo? Shoot, I used to have a

Game Boy back in the day. Played the heck outta that thing"

 

 

"Grandpaaaa, dis isn't da same as a silwy Game Boyy", Grandson says laughingly annoyed.

 

 

"Whaddya talkin' abouuut? Lemme see that thing", retorts grandpa with confidence.

 

 

"We can pway together!" Excitedly replies grandson. Grandson proceeds to hand grandpa another one of the devices.

The device is merely a 3x3in rectangular chrome device with a rounded spherical bottom. Similar to a three dimensional ellipse

divided in half with central a flat surface.

 

Grandpa examines it oddly, looking on all sides, "Where's the D-Pad?...How do I turn this thing on?"

 

 

Giggling, grandson exclaims, "You just have to holwd it with boff hands gwandpaaa"

 

 

"Oh, okay", grandpa says as he places both hands on the device, "What're we even 'playing' anyway?"

 

 

"Caww of Duty: Stormfront!", excitedly replies grandson as he quickly gets comfortable and places both hands on the device,

at which point you begin to hear a low binaural beat begin to build within the system and slowly growing louder.

 

 

"Well CoD's kinda gay -- but What the heck is that sound?", asks grandpa in confusion.

 

 

"It's startin' up Gwandpa", replies grandson with a big innocent smile.

 

 

As the noise begins to grow grandpa's mind begins to wonder into nostalgic memories, "Oh...well you know when I was your age,

I would play Pokemon none stop. I swear, I had the best line-up ever. My Dragonite was level 100 -- " Suddenly,

within the blink of an eye grandpa is transported to a drop ship transport about to land in the middle of a barren planet war zone. He looks around

in frantic fear and confusion, seeing he is surrounded by a dozen other future soldiers preparing to fight. Everyone is strapped into their seats with

metal chest harnesses, wearing futuristic black and grey military protective equipment and wielding heavy assault rifles. The ship is severely turbulent

as it draws nearer to the surface of the battle. "What the hell is happening!? Where am I?!!!", cries Grandpa

to all of the nameless soldiers he is seated next to. All of which seem have their wits about them.

 

 

"Private! Get your shit together! Now is not the time to lose it!", commands what appears to be the Sergent of the ship's unit.

 

 

Grandpa is shocked in fear facing the Sergent, who returns his body to the upright position of his harnessed seat while someone next to grandpa gestures

the Catholic cross across their chest as they kiss their Christian pendant. Grandson then reveals his smiling face and waves "Hi, gwandpaaa!", says grandson

with cheer.

 

 

"Oh my God! What the hell is happeningggg!!!??" screams grandpa.

 

 

"We got to take the Cwompound, gwandpa" replies grandson as he rocks his head from side to side joyfully.

 

 

"What!!? What the hell are you talking about? What is this!!?, exclaims grandpa in utter fear and calamity.

 

 

"Just fowwow me grandpa!" laughs grandson as the ship comes to a sudden halt.

 

 

"OhGodFUCK! What is hap-!" grandpa is screaming as The harnesses suddenly rise, and the side hatch of this ship immediately burst open. The noise quickly grows ten-fold, with near by explosions and dust flying so thick that its barely visible to see more than 20 feet in front of oneself.

 

"Alright Men! Into eternity we fly!" shouts the Sergent as he throws his hand forward giving the command to charge. Large amounts of similar ships can be

seen landing, and leaving near their drop zone.The terrain is virtually flat as the dust bowl continues to fog any view besides what lies ahead.

 Hundreds of soldiers are running into the clouds of fog.

Many of which are being mowed down by continued chain

gun fire and blown to pieces by explosions and artillery.

 

Grandpa, standing in the haul doorway of the drop ship stares in disbelief at what he is witnessing when suddenly he feels quick jab to his

right leg and a grab

at his hand from grandson exclaiming, "Come on gwandpa, follow meeee". Grandson begins to run haphazardly into the fray of smoke.

 

"Wait! NO!" Grandpa yells as he suddenly becomes aware of his grandson sprinting into a firefight. Grandpa proceeds to sprint after him. As he runs blindly in grandson's last known direction,

all he can see is random soldiers faces gliding with him in his run as well as the amount of vigor and strength he now has that was not previously existent in his normal body's elder state.

This revelation is quickly forgotten as nearly as soon as he sees more soldiers passing by him in the haze, they are quickly swept down by bursts and flashes of light and blasts from

whistling bombs from above. Dirt and debris began to soil grandpa's clothing.

A sudden cut back to grandpa and grandson in the living room shows both of them experiencing REM with grandpa's mouth wide open making odd screaming noises and grandson smiling and giggling.

Cut back to the battlefield, the only usable cover are large boulders that randomly appear through the haze. A large explosion in the distance knocks grandpa down to the ground, the heat from the blast causes his face

to be flushed in even more sweat. Grandpa scrambles on all fours to the nearest boulder that is nearly 12ft high and sizable enough

to cover four men. Large numbers of other soldiers continue to pass by on both sides. Grandpa presses his body tightly against the boulder next to soldiers of which are poised to return fire with no direct leader.

On grandpa's side is a medic attempting to revive an unconscious soldier with CPR and various medicinal shot administrations that only require the grasp of a trigger to instill into the skin. This is to no avail.

 

"God damn it, wake up!" Screams the medic to the dead soldier, of whom has a severe burns and lacerations to the entire front of the body.

 

The soldier on grandpa's other side nearest the edge of cover pops out and shoots blindly into the fog screaming, "Motherfuckerrrrsss!".

A stray bullet flies in and goes directly between the soldiers neck and clavicle. He collapses in front of grandpa grasping his neck as blood begins to spray out of his artery

with each heart beat. Grandpa's face is stricken with shock as he lets out a girlish screech.

 

"Fuckin' pull him over here!" Demands the medic. With slight hesitation, grandpa begins to drag the hemorrhaging soldier closer to cover and the medic. As he lets go, the medic screams for

grandpa to, "Hold pressure on it!". As grandpa places his hands in a viscous pool of blood, his clothes and face are quickly covered in red spurts and drops with each diminishing amount of

circulation. A sudden cut back to the living room shows a paralleled horror on grandpa's face.

 

"Stay with me!" screams the medic as he scrambles through his pack for more gauze pads. The nameless soldier is looking directly in to the eyes of Grandpa as the soldier takes his last

liquid filled breaths and his eyes leave focus past grandpa and into the distance. The pressure from the open vessel that grandpa is rigorously holding begins to halt completely and the soldier's eyes slowly fade shut.

Covered in blood and earth, grandpa stares deeply in astonishment at the man that is lifeless in his arms. Grandpa hears no sound around him.

 

 

"Whatchya doin' gwandpa???", abruptly questions grandson of which pulls grandpa from his haze in disbelief that his grandson was standing before him, let alone smiling. The assault rifle almost larger than he was.

"We gotta' take the compownd, gwandpa. Hurwy up!" Grandson grabs grandpa's hand and pulls him up off his knees and they begin to race in the direction that all the other soldiers are heading.

In the distance, the flashes from the machine guns can be seen quickly approaching. As they came closer, the number of bodies increased as well as the number falling soldiers all around them.

Grandpa sees a large trench system approaching, and grandson jumping into it. In fear for his grandson's life, he races into the trench. He follows his grandson's lead and keeps his head down.

They are now progressing through a large labyrinthine trench and begin to follow a small group of about eight allied soldiers. The gun fire and explosions are constant and it is nearly suicide to lift

attempt a view outside of what was becoming a mass grave. The dust was not as nearly as dense within the trench system and soldiers could be seen attempting to enter the trench only to be laced with crossfire. The artillery fire

was creating large amounts of debris and, at times, human extremities to soar through the air.  

 

 

"They're fuckin' killin' us out there! We need to take that compound!" Exclaims the drop ship Sergent, as he slides to meet his team within the trench.

 

 

Grandpa's heart is in a constant state of continuous adrenaline and his pupils are fixed on following his grandson and the other soldiers in any direction they choose to progress.

 

"Don't worwy gwandpa, I know where I'm gowing. I beat this pwart yestawday", reassures grandson. Grandpa continues to follow in complete amazement and horror.

They suddenly approach within 25 meters, the flank of a larger artillery gun and anti-air guns that combined blasts create vibrations so dense that, with each explosive blast, the ground is shaken to its core and human

ears enter into utter shell shock ringing and tinnitus. Grandson abruptly throws up  his fist, giving the command to halt. Grandpa stares in focus and silence as he sees the enemy is completely unaware, garbed in

ghillie suit uniforms that match the gray and tanned tones of this alien world. Grandson motions for half of the assembled team to approach the artillery nest from a branching trench path, creating an alternative

angle of attack.

 

Without hesitation, grandson turns around to grandpa and says, "You eva shwot one-a deez?", revealing a missile launcher and tossing it at grandpa who nearly stumbles upon catching it. Grandpa stares in bewilderment.

"It's swimple, just aim and shwoot." Giggles grandson as he motions the remaining men to ready their rifles. "On my cwommand", says grandson. Grandpa quickly shakes himself out of his emotional paralysis and readys the launcher on

his shoulder, looking down the display system. Which aumatically targets the largest artillery canon, stating "FIR RDY". The artillery team continues their foundation shattering battery and the team of soldiers lead by

grandson have their rifles aimed at the ready directly towards the enemy nest and grandpa is sitting shaking with a rocket launcher reluctantly pointed at an unknown adversary. Time comes to a near crawl and the beads of sweat

roll down grandpa's jittering face....

 

"COVERWING FIYA!!!" Commands grandson with all the air in his little lungs as he and the rest of the team light up the air with assault rifle rounds into the naive opposing forces. At that moment, grandpa, reflexively pulls the launching

trigger and a missile expels a huge back draft that pushes the dust around the trench out in all directions and in the blink of an eye the projectile burst forward and then 100 ft straight into the air. The recoil cascades

grandpa onto his back. All he can see is nameless soldiers unloading clips in a congruent direction and his grandson laughing as he hip fires his gun using a shoulder strap. Without warning, like a comet, the projectile hurdles

directly downward and a bright flash of blinding white light and silence is all that can be sensed. Everyone takes cover and awaits visual clarity. Of which is obtained after a large gust of particles are pushed past the entire squad

through the cravas of the trench. All that remains is a massive thick smoke cloud, forming out of a crater in the ground where the artillery nest was previously located. As grandpa began to gain his bearring, white ash began to settle

over them like snow.

 

"Nice shwot, gwandpa!" exclaims grandson as all the soldiers cry out in victory. Amongst the shear epicness of the entire situation, grandpa manages to release a small smirk on his mug as the chills of success reverberate throughout his spine.

 Grandpa looks at his grandson, as he begins to climb to the edge of the trench and stand before his fellow soldiers. "We have twaken down deir defwenses. Now we must bwing down their stwonghold! Fowwow me to Victorweee!!!"

Grandson cries as he lifts his guns over his head with both arms. Every soldier, including grandpa cannot help but roar with courage.

 

*CRACK*

 

Is all that is heard. Grandson stumbles at his perch, and places his hand on his chest revealing crimson painting his fingers.

 

"Noooooo!!" Screams grandpa as he rushes to bottom of the trench and catches his grandson as he falls. All is silent as every soldier stares onward at grandpa holding his fatally wounded grandson in his embracing arms. Tears glisten down his face,

unable to vocalize his grief past his disbelief.

 

"Gwandpa", whispers grandson in grandpa's ear.

 

"Yes", quickly relishes grandpa - at his kin's every word.

 

 

"GAME OVERRRRRRRRRRR", interrupts an ominous and robotic voice heard over top all the game world. At which the entire environment begins to suddenly breakdown around grandpa and he and grandson are rapidly whisked back to the their living room.

 

Grandpa looks onward in a stupor, completely motionless for several seconds when grandson interrupts, "What do ya fink gwandpa??" Pausing, and taking a few curious sniffs of the air, "What's dat smell?"

 

 

Cuts to an exiting add line from Nintendo stating, "Nintendo Synthesis - It'll make your grandpa shit his fuckin' pants" 




 A colossal planetary orb overlooks our home. Nearly at the climax of its Kiss with the rock we call Earth. Some of the most amazing shades of blue you'll ever see. Colors you don't find here. Colors artists attempt, and fail to replicate. It only peaks every 68 years, but you can always see it coming months in advance. A new star in the sky at first, then within half a year's time, the harvest moon dawns forth its peak. Some call it our planet's passing lover, some call it the thief, because it always drags our moon with it for a time before gravity can set itself right - which it always does. But when it does come, its always an exciting time here. The world seems to come together for nearly a year in the common endeavor to appreciate what some hold as God's passing eye. It pushes the rain away from certain areas, and you always know it's closest when the clouds gather and the water just won't stop falling. And then comes the twilit days and shadowless nights. By the time the sun hits noon, the sky is eclipsed, and the blue hues don't miss anything after sun down. It truly is an experience that all should share in at least one lifetime.

Sheel and I laid under the aquatic nightlight, atop our favorite get away spot overlooking our village - Of which was celebrating Peak Banquet. The festival lights gave illusion that the night's excitement was nearly at its apex, paralleling the sapphire that penetrated our night. I felt almost invigorated by the energy the blue bulb in the sky was giving off. And when we got away from all the noise, its song can be heard through energetic vibrations that hum only soft enough for those who listen closely - those who seek to hear. And as we laid there, holding hands, I could feel the vastness of the cosmic sphere reverberating through us both, nearly enhancing through our physical connection.

"They say it's getting closer, you know", Sheel gently let out. In my near hypnosis, I nearly missed what she'd said.

"Ah... You don't buy into that Collision Course fear do you?" I rattled off in nearly the same words I've heard from my parents time and time again. She paused for a long while, her eyes reflecting equally beautiful seas of blue back at the monster in the sky.

"I don't know...my father's been doing a lot of work at the observatory lately, and he says...something's changed." Her gaze never broke from the atmosphere, and I had no words to say. "He says at this rate, this might be the last cycle before...The Event. Silence filled the air as what she said began to pass over me. Fireworks could be seen popping and fading in sparkling reds and yellows near village square. The irony of it all nearly brought a smile to my face. We laid there quietly, looking directly at what some held in highest form of natural phenomenon and beauty, and by the same means, could very well bring about our end. But the fear, the fear had not over taken me. I knew I was exactly where I was suppose to be. Sheel grasped my hand even tighter, we looked into each others' eyes, and all I could hear was that gentle hum. 




 Can this fraud go on any longer? Can this self perpetuating cycle of debt sustain itself? I know no one can predict the future but does anyone have any predictions about the future of our beloved "centralized banking system"? Will their reign cease to fall? Or will it collapse in upon itself? 









 My life is pretty boring. I work 2-11pm and then go hang out with friends until 4AM, the majority of which aren't Christians. I try to hang out with some Christian friends but often time find myself bored because they think having fun is watching a Disney movie or something. I then sleep until I have to go back to work again. My life is boring and I don't know how to reinvigorate my Faith and life. Could use prayer and guidance.  









 I watched a video about an African pastor who had an out of body experience (OBE) in which he died and saw [Heaven and Hell](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA7mtcJ748U) and was brought back to life. The angel told him that if he died right now he would go to Hell because he did not forgive his wife of what she had done in the past. This filled me with a lot of fear, as I wondered what other Sins I may be committing that could detrimentally send me to Hell if I did not make myself right with God and how I go about that. It confused me, as well, making me thankful that Jesus presented this pastor with his separating Sin but wonder where the line is drawn where we are covered by grace but also held accountable? 

I know this crosses the barrier of works vs grace, but I need some Biblical encouragement and clarification. Maybe some personal experiences? 




 I feel like I'm in a constant battle with sin and am constantly losing. I need encouragement, because at times I fear the loss of my salvation. I try to be good, but i make so many mistakes. Sometimes I wonder if i was ever saved at all. But i truly do believe and understand Christ forgives all sins and try to live a good life but I sometimes hide from God, in a world of sin. I just need prayer for this struggle. Encouraging words and thank you.  




 I live in the basement and my room has a bathroom on the other side of the room. In the dream, I thought I saw strange lights coming from the bathroom. Wearing only my undies, I went over to investigate. As I approached the door, I can hear a vibratory noise growing louder with every closing step. In a bold curiosity, I burst open the door to witness three shadowy figures standing side by side in my bathroom, one substantially taller in the center of them. The vibrational noise was nearly deafening and originated from a black portal that stretched the length of the wall. It was wide enough for one person to enter through at a time and had a purple energetic hue pulsating around it. In fear of these featureless entities, I immediately fall backwards out of the bathroom grasping the knob, pulling the door closed. Nearly instantly, I snap out of my shock and am determined that whatever they are doing is malevolent. Being already on the floor, I thrust my body into the door to stop whatever it is they are doing. Now there is a large gust of energy and sound that is pressing back to keep me from entering. I am barely able to peak my head in as my hair flies back from the propulsive forces. I witness the two smaller entities begin to depart by stepping casually through the portal. In utter terror, I am left beholding the larger creature standing before me. He proceeds to slowly turn, that which I consider to be the shape of his head, in my direction. I lay pressed against the door and forceful winds, vulnerable and powerless as to his next action. Suddenly, he projects a grotesque  image of a mummified face, wrappings loosely hanging off, and shoots this illusion in my direction with a swift breath. I am abruptly overtaken with a fearful paralysis that casts me to the ground, shutting the door.  That's when I wake up.  









 If a lot of people on here believe 9/11 was an inside job, who should be held responsible? Just like any other crime, who would have benefited the most from this particular string of events? I know many companies benefit from war, but are there any particular individuals that are highly connected? 




 ...and why there are no alternative theories besides creationism? 









 Its a beautiful woman with a green background and she has a beast with a snake body but with a ton of different animal heads. It's an amazing picture but i can't find it anywhere on the internet. Any ideas of who it is or a link? Thank you 




 Often times when I feel spiritually moved and sometimes without feeling internally emotional, I experience a vibration or chills that reverberate through my body. I experience this often times and most commonly only when I am partaking in or thinking about something related to Jesus or God. Does anyone else have experiences of "feelings" that they usually equate with the presence or stirring of The Holy Spirit?

 only I understand the complexities of dish-doing 














 Often times from the teens to mid 20s, I've noticed women are more interested in the a-hole or the one who doesn't pay them as much attention. Does this perspective change in women as they get older and look back and wish they would have dated that nice guy? And if so, at what point do most girls then find the nice guy more appealing? 




 With oil controlling the market and primarily how most cars are fueled, what do you foresee the future of automobiles and overall transportation developing towards?     Flying cars is an acceptable answer 














 If he hypothetically didn't die and the news is just presenting him as dead, won't they easily be contradicted when he strikes again? If his wallet was found at the scene of the burning building, how was his ID identified at the U.S./Mexican border? Was the character of Dorner a creation of the media to distract us from something? There just seems to be a lot of contradictions that I am not understanding.  














 What are the riches that we receive in Heaven? I've realized I am nothing without God, and I have put my faith in salvation in Jesus as He who has given me the grace to enter His Father's kingdom. My only issue is that sometimes I do not always go "without sin" and I am ashamed of this. I'd ask that you pray for me about this. I am also curious as to what are the riches of Heaven that we receive? Do some of us get a gold mansion and others end up in a cardboard box? I would be okay with being homeless in Heaven than a landlord in Hell. Once again, I'd ask that you would pray that I would see no pleasure in Sin and love God through obedience, and if you can help me to understand my overlying question, thanks! Jesus is endless gracious :) 




 This is the internet. Fuck you --- Shun shunnnnn shhhhunnnn. Obama. Huffington Post. Papa Johns. Everyone better share MY interests! MY INTERESTS! MINE!!!!!!!!! ME ME ME ME MEEEeeeee  









 I see a lot of evil in this world, especially in the corruption of the United States government. Don't get me wrong, I understand the power of prayer and the coming of Jesus one day, but is it wrong of me to want to make a change with violence? Our forefathers were Christian, and they fought for their independence from tyranny a few hundred years ago. Is it such a bad thing to want to take a stand against the direction that I see our nation heading towards? Some may not see our country going in the direction of evil and tyranny that I perceive but I can feel it in my bones and feel it necessary to make some sort of serious change or resistance in the future. Any thoughts? Please consider what I'm saying, because countries like Germany and China have disarmed their citizens prior to enslaving them in past and I see it coming soon. It's obvious Satan has infiltrated our government long ago. I just need some serious discourse. Thank you.  



















 At times when I read the Gospels I feel this amazing sense of freedom from sin when Jesus preaches his purpose and in the later books that speak about works NOT being what gets you to Heaven. But then I see other scriptures that talk very highly of repentance and completely ridding your life of sin or else you will go to Hell. It creates this confusion, or paradox that leaves me stranded in my Faith. There are certain sins that I struggle with daily, and am trying to overcome. Yet because I have not overcame them, I feel various preaches condemning me to Hell, even though I have faith that Jesus is my representative before God and has justified me. I don't use Jesus to reason why I should continue sinning, I just fall sometimes and I can't comprehend this mixed message of Law vs Grace.  




 I've been having difficulty lately as a new RN grad to find a job that doesn't require at least 6 months of experience and I was recently hired as an RN in a local nursing home. Apparently I will be one of the only RN's they have and their pay is, from what I heard, "an insult to RNs" - 15$/hr. Which for me is fine, as its a pay increase from minimum wage and I need the experience. Any advise from other nurses who worked in the assisted living field?  












































 2 interceptions in his first two drives in a needed win for a playoff spot against Washington. And a huge turnover in the last drive that could have pushed them into the post season. I'm sick of Romo, its time for a change.  









 such as the federal reserve, etc. Don't know much about them, but they have such an impact on one of the greatest topics within our countries politics. 




 You would think there wouldn't be so much insecurity and scrutiny about something that all men have and have no control over  




 why or why not? 




 Don't spare the details. How you felt, what it looked like, why you did it. All killers are welcome 




 ...particularly a female :D 









 I work at a bar so my sleep schedule is already pretty off. I sleep in everyday and stay up late normally. But lately, as we enter winter, I sleep in longer and longer. What's even weirder is sometimes I'll wake up, have a hearty breakfast and want to go right back to sleep for a few more hours. I'm also struggling finding a real job out of college and I don't know if that is creating a depression inside myself that also adds to my desire to sleep. But I'm also just generally interested in the normal changes that happen to the human body entering into the winter months. Thanks  




 Crisis 2 wasn't as great a hit as they anticipated, mainly due to it's CoD style compromised gameplay. I just don't anticipate Crisis 3 to do any better due to in part that it seems like it being rushed out the door.  




 there are other good musical artists out there. Wait...he must be atheist? no? liberal? no? ahhhhh, wait, wait, a white, college educated, cat lover?....I'm stumped 




 I keep hearing the US economy is about to implode and I hear it is smart to put your assets in Gold and Silver rather than paper generated money. Is this pointing to the idea of a debt based economy that we all just put our faith into? Also, how would I go about purchasing gold and silver? 




 BORRRRRRINGGGGGGG 












































 make that 7 




 I always find that as soon as I demonstrate an interest towards a female, she seems to hold very little interest. But the girl that I don't care about and pick on, most commonly has interest in me? It just seems to be a cruel cycle.  



















 I know a lot of games have deadlines and I'm curious to hear from the perspective of the developers who are forced to put out a product long before they feel it is ready or satisfactory. Thanks :) 




 I'm curious as to their purposes and how and what the body uses them for. Also, in what order and when does your body break down your own body's tissues for energy? Maybe you could also relate this to working out so people have a good idea of what workouts burn fat/and build muscle and maybe proper nutrition? I know its a lot, and tackle this as you see fit. Thank you ahead of time 




 For most Christian men, masturbation is a struggle. Lust is accompanies it. About three weeks ago I stopped looking at porn/masturbating and felt incredibly strong in my faith. Oddly enough, the temptations became stronger as I felt my hormones rising daily. My hope was to have a wet dream - so I'd feel blameless etc etc. I didn't and just today I suddenly gave in and now I feel super guilty. But people alert me that guilt is not from God, and that it's not through anything we do that gets us to Heaven but through Christ alone and what He did on the cross. So, why do I still feel this incredibly amount of guilt when I should, quite possibly, be joyous that even in my lows, Jesus still loves me?

Thanks

PS - also, I gave in kind of after I felt that I had received what I wanted, which was a passing grade on a huge certification exam. I told myself that didn't play into it and that I just wanted to love and obey God, but I feel that after getting what I wanted, my selfish motives were presented 10 fold. Thoughts/prayers? and thnx

EDIT: Sorry if im not politically correct about terms. Just being honest 














 When I asked my father about the recent bombings, he responds by saying that he hopes they kill all of those muslim radicals. I try to explain to him that the situation is a lot more complicated than that and that Israel is more so to blame than Pakistan and that Israel is just as horrible to Pakistani people, he just brushes me off. He tries to quote the news but I attempt to explain to him that the news is going to paint our allies in a good light because the news is run by Israel and his immediate response is , "oh, you're an Antisemite". And it's just so frustrating trying to have a conversation with him because he sees everything from the perspective of a closed minded american who sits on his couch and watches football all day. I just don't feel educated on the topic enough to present my points out reasonably. Can someone help me to justify that Israel isn't as good as we make them out to be and why we're even allies with them?

EDIT: Palestine....shows how much I know.... 














 I met this non-Christian girl and we hit it off very well initially. It went so well as for me to, in some ways, set aside my belief that Christians have to marry other Christians, as I thought it would be too closed minded for me to give up an opportunity with someone like her. She is very kind, beautiful and loving and we had a great time the first few times we hung out. She then, randomly, alerted me over text message that she is in a 2 year relationship that is now long distance, but obviously still wanted to be friends. When I heard that, I actually cried, it was embarrassing, and I was at work and my boss saw me and let me go home. I thought I'd probably never hear from her much after that but she would still contact me in the mornings via text to see how my day was going and we went on a hike where I was able to share the gospel with her and very briefly express my feelings and desire to maintain friendship (tho I want more). As much as I figured the relationship would remain platonic, the generally flirtatious messages were still being sent from her. Eventually I felt as though she was tapering me out of her life, as I didn't receive any messages for a few days. But then, just yesterday she invited me over to watch a movie with her. We did so and nothing happened but at this point I just don't know how to take her. Because in her mind, she might think she has cleared the air with me and can play the innocent card if I confront her about our purposes together, but I can't help but feel as if though she is using me just for attention/back up in case things with her boy friend don't work out. I on the other hand struggle deeply because, I want to do the things of God and love her unconditionally without expectation, and not even focus on a relationship, but my internal fleshly desires want something more and its really confusing/tearing me up inside. I constantly feel like there are things unsaid between us, and I am afraid to be completely honest with her as I fear that I will ruin what we have or what God is using me for in her life. At the root, I know that the only relationship I require is in Christ, but I am struggling deeply and could use some wise interpretations as to what is occurring. Thank you.
