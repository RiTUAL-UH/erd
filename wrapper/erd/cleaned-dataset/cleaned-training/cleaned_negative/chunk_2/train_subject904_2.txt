 Well my hope was that since its in the second person, you make that choice. What would YOU do in that situation. 




 Damnit Abigail. Get your shit together!
 




 makes sense. western jets are indeed, the coolest shit to ever have. ever. 




 I hate to tell you, but i've read a nosleep with the EXACT same plot, but I believe there was only one clone of the original... 




 Yeah, OP, i get you want this and i think its nice, but the truth is, they cant (and wont, i dont blame them) change a whole system that is already made, just to make crafting a bit more challenging.

Also, in some ways i dont like your idea. If you think to dayz epoch, it is very hard to build there. That has its problems, as it creates an extreme gap between the group of 10 guys with a cinder fortress and the noobs in the tent that get gunned down every five minutes.
 




 Even in dayz, kos city, i make it my goal to not have to put anyone down. Dont get me wrong, i die a lot, but i plan to be the friendliest guy you will meet. 




 Yeah the garand is the one im praying for.

 I would personally rather see more practical weapons. The xm2010 is rare as hell as is, and same for the m82. Desert eagles i guess, but they shouldn't be abundant. As for the tar and famas. The famas is an exotic weapon and should be rare. And the tar would probably be the civilian version (iwi tavor) and not have to be ultra rare 




 Alright so nearly every gun on earth... Don't forget, this is America.
