 *Ensure ..... I highly doubt he's going back in time to buy insurance. That's just way to convoluted for any time travel paradox.
Edit: Although it could make him rich with the payouts..... 




 His probablity logic is not off. They have a higher chance of having a smurf on their team because there is 5 people that you don't know if they are or not but only 4 on your team. So smurf chances are stacked in their favour unless as he suggested you are a smurf yourself. Of course that doesn't diminish the odds of the four on your team of course, but still higher chance on theirs. 




 I don't think mmo's which are a different type of game in all honesty but still a game with major updates, content and balancing still don't require you to be a certain pvp rank or have completed so much content to be a QA tester. So why should it be different for riot? 




 Quality assurance tester. 




 I don't think that Is the point the op is trying to get across. I completely agree hiring people based on their skill of the game is just silly, if it is true of course. That aside I have never heard of this from any game before other than their usually being a stipulation of a love for the game in question.
Edit: For spelling. 




 I'm sure that isn't supposed to be possible, in ranked at least, in normals I'm not sure. 




 I am not entirely sure because I don't use target champs only. But I would imagine Riot had intended to not use both at the same time because that would make poking through the wave incredibly easy and thus would have set attack move to override target champ only. As I said not entirely sure but it makes sense to me.
