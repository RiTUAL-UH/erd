 I FUCKED UP REDDIT. I FUCKING FUCKED UP. THIS IS WHAT I GET. 

FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK. 

A spider came down on his web from my ceiling and ONTO MY FUCKING LAP PILLOW. He landed on the pillow and began crawling across it, I was frozen in place unable to fucking move by this unsettling and surprising move. 

Out of a rush of panic and delirium i used MY FUCKING HANDS to squish him into the pillow. But the pillow isn't a hard surface, there isn't enough surface friction there, I don't know if I killed him because I CANT FIND HIS GUTS OR CORPSE. 

And to make matters worse I think he is a spiderling babe, so THERES PROBABLY MILLIONS OF THEM PLOTTING REVENGE. 

I'm so fucked reddit. I gotta burn my apartment down. MY CAT IS NO FUCKING HELP. FAT CAT ASSHOLE. 

I'm gonna try and find him, but my carpet is brown and my shorts/ and recliner are both black. FUCK. I'll try and update as the situation progresses into the early morning. Not sleeping tonight. 

**UPDATE: Well reddit, I can't find anything. I can't find the spider's remains or his guts or his live body. Save yourself reddit. I'm a goner. I think maybe I will buy a hotel tonight. I'll bring my cat, as lazy and fat as he is, I don't want him to be killed. This is the end, I'm sure of it.**

Update: Still not found. Hard to sleep. Got a hotel with my cat the next two nights and set a bug bomb off in the apartment...

**TL;DR  can't find the spider i did or did not kill, may have to leave all my possessions and move...tonight**

 This was a great forgotten film I feel like. It wasn't the best of movies, but it had some good acting, a solid story, and enough weirdness to say the time was well spent watching this creation. 

So here's the discussion: What other forgotten films do you think are good? (or films no well known by the general movie buff) 




 It's still the strangest movie I've ever seen.  





























 Thanks to /u/KingCaspianX for counting down the last 200 with me!

 They were working not 20 minutes ago. When a video ended I went to start another one and VLC crashed immediately. I went to try the last video file that worked but it crashed too. I tried using my other video players but they all crash immediately.  HDC, VLC, Realplayer, itunes, they all crash when i start to play a video file- audio files they play fine. 

I do not know why it started doing that so suddenly. It happened yesterday too, but I ran a malwarebytes scan and got rid of some malware and then it started working again. However, I ran malware again and it found nothing today. So I am confused. 

I have windows 7, 64bit, 8GB Ram 

All my graphics card drivers are up to date. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the video players. Any suggestions?  














 Does anyone think that this lady probably had a bothan husband? The way she conveys the information is so sad and filled with such sorrow. 

I'm willing to bet one of the dead bothans was her lover.

 I have Windows 7, 64 bit

8GB RAM

I have had VLC for a long time, it's fully updated and the newest version. I began using it a few hours ago to watch a television show .avi file and another was a .mkv file. It worked fine as it has always worked fine.
Then I decided to listen to some music. So I listened to an audio file on the VLC player. When I was finished I went back to the video file and VLC crashed. It kept crashing upon trying to open a video file. It still plays music files .mp3 but not mp4, .avi. or .mkv files. It just crashes immediately.
I tried uninstalling and reinstalling which did not work, as well as resetting all the preferences. Troubleshooted some stuff on youtube/google but couldn't find anything that was like this issue.

In addition, I tried installing older versions to no avail. I also ran a virus scan, but nothing changed.

EDIT: Fixed it. I ran Malwarebytes and it removed some malware and now VLC runs again. Weird. Keeping this thread up in case someone encounters same issues. I had originally run Avast Virus Scanner and it found nothing so I figured it was okay.

 Last thread was great! Wonderful counting by everyone, especially the last 300.

 I am seeking assistance to obtain a mural painted on work building to help liven up the surrounding community a bit. It also goes to support a local artist in Columbus, Ohio. It also helps the artist attend art school.

   'I've got your permit right here!' And thus began the best movie ever filmed. Kung Fury, a short film, about a cop who becomes Kung Fury, master Kung-Fu martial artist, via lightning/cobra strike. 
He protects the city of Miami from crime with his super awesome one liners and impenetrable forces. This adventure he must hack time with the help of his friend Hackerman to rid the world of Hitler, who wants the pwoer of Kung Fury for himself. 
         
Written   directed by David Sandberg, it was originally a trailer turned into short film. Made with the help of an amazing kickstarting campaign what David Sandberg has accomplished here is nothing short of brilliance in animation   filmmaking. After my first viewing, I thought it would be better if it could be a feature length film. Then I realized, I could just watch the film three times in a row and it would fulfill that need. 

 This film has everything you could ever want from an over the top, cheesy one liner 80's flick. 

1. Laser-Raptors

2. Hitler, the villain

3. Triceracop- Half mancop/Half Triceratop

4. David Hasselhoff singing 80s style music 

5. Cheesy one-liners 

6. Arcade machines with lasers trying to kill people 

7. Thor 

8. Barbarianna   Katana, Viking Age warrior women with machine guns

9. The Nintendo Power Glove hacking time with 80s computers 'breaking' time. 

10. T-Rex Vs Golden Metal Eagle monster fight with small t-rex arms vs small eagle legs. 

11. Anime sequence with cobras as spirit animals.

12.  Amazing action sequence where Kung Fury takes on Hitler's minions. This scene is perhaps one of the greater achievements of the film. It reminded me of playing Mega Man   Sonic where the POV moves horizontally. Simply genius. 

13. Cheesy product placement. 

**14. And finally paying homage to Laser Unicorns with the beginning arcade game being laser unicorns and a laser unicorn seen in the anime sequence when Fury goes to 'heaven'.**



 Every so often a film comes along, once in a lifetime, where it makes you rethink your entire life. This is that film. The greatest film ever made.  I salute this film. And now will go watch it again. 

**Also, watch the film in 144P or the lowest setting on youtube if you can. It's better than HD. HD is good, but to get the full effect, go for the lowest setting in quality.** 













































































































 I have an HP All in one. It is old I got it in 2011. I have used it to play two games in the past: Ultima Online and Dark Age of Camelot. It's always worked fine playing UO, never any overheating problems. I've never had any problems with Dark Age of Camelot until today. I went to re-download the game and play after haven't played for about a year...

When I go to patch the game, which takes some time to patch 3 GBs... my GPU gets up to around 80 degrees and the computer shuts off so I have to wait for it to cool down. I have a fan pointed at my computer to help, but it doesn't help so much. I don't have my computer connected to a TV or anything. 

What could have changed in the past year that my computer would start overheating playing a game I've played for years on this machine? What can I do to ensure it won't overheat without having to buy anything at this juncture? 

My drivers are all up to date. I have ATI Radeon HD 5570 









 Does anyone know if they have an ETA on when they are coming back up? It's a free server.  
























 One of my favorite films growing up. It's not a particularly good film, but it is pretty awesome. It's such a different superhero type movie. 
[Anyone remember this movie?](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099365/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_1)

   I watched this movie again today. I figured it would be different than the last I watched it which was when I was 15/16. I liked it a lot then and I loved it even more now. 

  I understand the director has made really terrible films since this starting with The Village; however, Unbreakable is quite amazing. I enjoyed the acting from Samuel L Jackson. I think, besides a few other roles it may have been his best acting job. I liked the cinematography and the music. It gave each character a theme much like superhero films. For Bruce Willis, his character had cool colors always around him, greens   blues. While the supposed supervillain was immersed in purple. I liked that contrast. 

I think what I enjoyed most in the movie was this idea of understanding our place in this world. 

I liked watching it in contrast with the influx of all the comic book movies that are popular right now. This is so different from them, even more different than Nolan's Batman films. His Batman's films attempted a sense of more realism I think, but this film captures it ...differently, much more dramatic less action. 

What are some movies similar to this? I can't think of any. It's unique.  




























































































































 Why couldn't they beam Spock/Khan back to the Enterprise while they are fighting? Chekov says it is become he can't get a lock because they are moving. But..in Star Trek (2009), he beams Kirk and Sulu back on board when they are falling without a parachute. So they were moving a lot faster/worse then, why can't he simply do the same this time when all they are doing is fighting?

Also...wasn't Kirk dead too long for them to save him. I mean, he was dead for what 30 minutes? That's...I don't understand this. So..Khan's blood can effectively raise the dead? Why don't they just harvest his blood? 




 I've seen 1, 2 and 3. I enjoyed 1 actually because it was more in space n shit. I liked Wrath of Khan a lot and the search for spock was interesting to say the least but wasn't really as good as 2, but it was better than 1. 

I read the synopsis for 4..and ..humpback whales? It just seems kind of strange. So out of 4, 5, and 6 which one is seen as next best from 2? 









 I heard some stuff about insurance money 10 million dollars not to play golf ever again. But that was over a year ago. He was a solid golfer, I loved watching him play.  





























 What order should I read middle earth books in? 

I have read The Hobbit   Lord of the Rings. 

Here's what other books I have. 

Children of Hurin, Lost Tales Part 1, Lost Tales Part 2, The Silmarillion,   The Lays of Belariand
