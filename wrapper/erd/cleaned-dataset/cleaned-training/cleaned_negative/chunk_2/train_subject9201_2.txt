 What *is* popularity? Does it accurately show the preferences of people who have been on rpggeek.com who were arsed enough to vote? Close enough. Does it accurately represent what rpgs are played most around the world? No. Does it accurately represent what rpgs people *want* to play around the world? No. Does it accurately represent how much money is being spent on each game? No. Does it accurately represent what games someone could expect to see being played if they walked in to a random gaming store? No. Does it accurately represent what you would see being played if you walked into a random gamer's house on game night? No. 

In fact, every single one of those questions would have a different ranking. All being "correct", and yet all being different, despite representing the same basic thing. Without a goal, the data has no meaning. With a goal, the data has a bias. Decide which way you want to be wrong. 

I can actually give you a *real* answer though. D D5e is doing really well, and is *mostly* replacing all other forms of D D for a large majority of people who like D D. Mostly because it is new, and is "good enough" to not piss people off. Hype isn't really a major driving force in its success. It is not better or worse than Dungeon World. They are also not mutually exclusive. There are people who like both, people who like one and not the other, and people who don't like either. None of those people are wrong. 




 I generally think these lists are garbage, and don't really think they represent anything accurately (I know way too much about data collection/interpretation). 

However, seeing Pathfinder all the way down at 33 brings a tear of joy to my eye, and so god bless this list for that. 




 Here are some of my favorites:

[Deadzone](http://www.manticgames.com/games/deadzone.html) (kickstarter for new stuff [here](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1744629938/deadzone-infestation-sci-fi-skirmish-game) ): Miniatures skirmish wargame. I'm not going to list all the wargames I like, but this one not only has a pretty low buy in, but also uses a pretty small table space (relatively), and has super cool terrain bits.

[Zombicide](http://zombicide.com/en/): Cooperative miniatures strategy game where you play as people trying to survive a zombie apocalypse. 

[Mars Attacks](http://www.manticgames.com/games/mars-attacks-the-miniatures-game.html): Miniatures game based on the movie (sorta). Can actually be combined with Deadzone, funnily enough.

[Netrunner](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/android-netrunner-the-card-game/): Cyberpunk card game. 




 Exactly what I thought when I saw it. I'd watch that movie though. 




 Each box is full of staples that you will most likely use in many lists for that army, and jacks/beasts that can be magnetized. 

I've been playing Warmachine for a few years, with an army of some size for at least half the factions, and these boxes are such a great deal that I have bought/pre-ordered every single one. For some of the boxes I already have some of the units (like bane thralls, gun mages, choir, etc), but the box is still a good deal even if I just threw those models in the garbage (except Cygnar, where it's only an okay deal if I throw the doubles in the garbage). If I can use two, I'm going to keep them, but a lot of them I'm going to give away to some people I'm trying to get into the hobby.

Keep in mind though, I got mine at about $97, so ymmv. I did the math though, and even if you are paying the full retail of $130, you are still getting a good deal (assuming you need the models). Cygnar is probably the least good deal (discount-wise), as you could buy everything that comes in the box individually (minus the mini-rulebook, another nice bonus to the box) for about $140 from somewhere like discountgamesstore. Skorne *was* probably the best (I don't even like Skorne and I had to have it). 




 I add Fate to just about every game I run. 5e is pretty easy. Anything true about a character works like an Aspect (all the things in their racial description and background, for instance), and just bump the number of Inspiration points they can have at a time to 3 (they are now Fate points, but you don't have to tell them that). Reward them like you would Fate points, and tell them they can use them to take advantage of "aspects" of their character. 

Games I've done this successfully with: Paranoia, Iron Kingdoms, Stars Without Number, Gamma World, Rogue Trader, D D5e, Shadowrun, and Numenera.

Funny thing is, I've never ran a Fate game on its own, and I haven't liked any of the Fate games I've played in. I technically don't like Fate by itself. Really I just hate the "well, how about you word it *this* way, that would make it a better Aspect" thing that happens, it makes you sound like an ass, and it makes people not used to that kind of game hate the game. Sometimes crappy aspects are perfectly fine, especially when you are just starting out. 




 I definitely start low and ramp up higher as the group gets used to my style of GMing (and the game system, if they are new to it). I would say I start in the 2-3 range, and end in the 7-10 range. It's a bigger range at the top, because I don't ever have just one option for success. 

1 group in 100 might do *everything* right, but most are going to have to make tough choices about what gets done well. Groups that don't care usually have everything go wrong, with maybe one thing working out in a way that isn't a complete disaster.

 I started with Mercs (bought a full Searforge army right off the bat) and I don't regret it at all. I can't say it's for everyone, but it's served me well.  




 Models acquired this way will stare at their owner with judging eyes all the time. They also will make every win they have taste bitter with shame, and losses all the more crushing served with a side order of guilt. 




 A dark wash and some highlighting would really help bring out the details, but I love the color choices. 

I'm just kidding, she's four. Great job!

Thin your paints... or something. 




 I would have pegged the Prince of Persia as a GURPS man. And you think you know a person... 




 There is an official alternative option for initiative in the DMG that is basically this. I do it often in more narrative focused games. 




 Sounds like fun. 

I've been running games since 1996, and I still get nervous when I start a new campaign. You'll get past that and to the fun fast enough. 




 Best of luck to you. There is some serious hate for GMs for hire, which is crazy. I think it's great, and in fact, when I stop blowing all my money on miniatures, I might hit you up (don't hold your breath though, wargaming addiction is a tough habit to kick). 




 Not only is it not copyrightable, if it was, your idea would probably be taken. Dice have been around for thousands of years, and even just in the last decade there have been probably a thousand games with different dice mechanics. 

The good news? No one is going to steal your idea. Ideas are cheap, and common. Even the good ones. The work you put into an idea is what you sell, because that's what is worth something. 

Bad news: No one cares about your "unique" idea. There are thousands of people with dreams and ideas that think about how cool it is that they had this nifty idea. Very few actually put in the blood, sweat, tears, time, and financial backing to make those ideas into something that other people can appreciate. 

Best of luck to you though.

 I had an idea in middle school for running an rpg campaign where the races were different kinds of food. Human's were burgers, halflings were sliders, gnomes were hot dogs, orcs were bbq ribs, elves were I think tacos, dwarves were pizza, half-orcs were pulled pork sandwiches, and half-elves were burritos. Pretty sure it hasn't been done yet, and I'm pretty sure it was about 10 minutes before lunch time when I thought of it. Speaking of, is it too late for dinner, or too early for breakfast? 




 Yep. I haven't run a full game of it yet, but it has a pretty good "job" generator section that's pretty good. Made by the same people who made the most recent Firefly rpg, and it apparently uses the same engine. 




 I've never played the Payday games, but there is an [RPG based on the TV show Leverage](http://www.margaretweis.com/index.php/shop#!/~/product/id=9555048). 




 [Not helpful, but relevant.](http://oglaf.com/kingshaped/) 




 I'm just curious, in what way did you think it was limited? 




 *edit: My science is bad and I feel bad.  




 Utter rubbish. What textbook did you get that out of? One from the 70s? You might want to try a more recent one, one not written by racists.  




 I feel bad for non-American cultures when aliens get here firing lasers. They just won't know what hit'em. 




 My favorites: 

The Infinite Improbability Drive from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

The BTL or "Better Than Light" Drive from Spaceship Zero.

Warhammer40k's Warp (basically the same as Event Horizon).

The space travel from the Ender's Game series. This one is basically just a ship that travels really fast, but because it approaches the speed of light, time slows down for the people on the ship, but not for people who aren't traveling. Which means it seems like a 1 year trip to you, if you are the one travelling, but it might take you 20 years to get there.  




 [This](http://www.artplaymix.com/portfolio/paizo_hijinx-mag1.gif) was a thing. Might not be what you are looking for, but if you want to check it out, it's for sale [here](http://paizo.com/products/btpy7z7f?Dungeon-Issue-99-with-Polyhedron-158). 




 I just picked up the All-in-one box for Legion. I saw I have the option between the two Strider units, and I thought I'd see which I should assemble them as. I have zero other legion.

I'm looking to eventually get p/eAbsylonia, pLylyth, and eThagrosh if that helps.

*edit: Also, what's the best way to do 15pt using the All-in-One box? 




 It's just a starter adventure and pre-mades for the new Unleashed book. It's the same as what's in the adventure kit, except digital. Map tiles / minis not included.

 If only it was for something other than Pathfinder. 




 If they are souls in mechanikal bodies, with full human intelligence (something jacks don't really have), you might want to look at the Convergence of Cyriss Clockwork Vessel stuff for the IKRPG in No Quarter #48.  




 I was just thinking about this again today, and I think I'd settle for having a Searforge Junior Warcaster. Preferably female.

If she had 3 focus, she could run two bunnies and have 1 upkeep going. 




 [This is a great idea. I'm so glad I thought of it.](http://i.imgur.com/snLplqq.jpg) 




 If it's just paint by numbers, the person who said that must be able to do [this](http://www.coolminiornot.com/), right?

It's only paint by numbers if you don't care how good the results are.  




 [These guys](https://www.vendio.com/stores/Docs_Games_Store) can get you what you need when your local dealer can't deliver. 




 Ooze wall is good. Crawling Ooze Wall sounds perfect to me.  




 Your second theory has been my theory since I first heard about this.

Every pusher in the world knows to make the first hit free.
