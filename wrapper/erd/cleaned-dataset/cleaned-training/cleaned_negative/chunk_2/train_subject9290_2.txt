 Just so I'm clear, I'm not asking for the most painful way to kill off your least favorite character. I'm asking what are good ways for a character to exit a show permanently.

Tag spoilers, of course. 









 I'm thinking of picking up Banks' Culture series. Do you recommend it as a must-read, or as an OK series, or not at all? 




 What books made you happy or euphoric (not amused or laughing) to have read them?

Some books that I liked are:

* The Stranger, by Camus
* The Unbearable Lightness of Being, by Kundera

I'm not looking for any horror, tragedy, or romance books, though.

 There are some long-running manga that either:

* Drags the main story to run as long as possible
* Starts new arcs that are not related to the beginning of the manga

What are manga that:

* Has a clear beginning, middle, and end
* The end is concludes the story from the beginning
* Doesn't drag 




 For anime that have a remake or a second adaptation, do you watch the original/first adaptation or the remake/second adaptation?

For example:

* Space Battleship Yamato
* Sailor Moon 




 And why do you keep watching it? 




 To be a good cross-genre novel, does it need to portray each genre well separately, or does it result in a wholly different genre than the parent genres? 




 And if so, what is the best example that you know of?
