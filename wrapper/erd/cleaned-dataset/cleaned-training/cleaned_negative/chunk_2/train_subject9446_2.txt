 * Bad things cause bad things
* Killing human beings without remorse is bad
* Video games can cause you to kill human beings without remorse

therefore:

* Video games can be bad.

I implore you to make a morality judgement on this. 




 They were already mentally prepared to kill people. 

That is an awfully casual way to say such an awful thing. 




 You should care about what any *compos mentis* older human being has to say. May I ask how old you are?

I'm surprised you mentioned the word 'love'. How would you respond if I accused your reaction to Lucas' thesis as being the result not of love but of fear? 

The meaning of the quotation will become clearer after a little more question and answer between us. 




 That the thought of men being made to play Doom^TM and then being given a gun (or an Xbox controller) and being asked to kill **human beings** doesn't trouble you. 

 









 I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and presume you're a troll.
 




 What he thinks... means nothing

To criticise with compassion is more skillful than to criticise with hatred. Hatred blinds. Someone doesn't need to be a degree-laden 'psychiatrist' to have meaningful things to say. George Lucas has created beautiful films (American Graffiti), and has self-consciously exploited the study of personality archetypes as successfully as anyone else (Star Wars). But more important than that - he is an elder of our tribe. Something tells me you had forgotten that. Correct me if I'm wrong.

All bodies pass through the universal substance, as it were into and out of a rushing stream; cohering and cooperating with the whole, as do our physical members with one another. How many a Chrysippus, a Socrates, an Epictetus has been engulfed by time! Remember this where you have to do with any man or thing whatsoever. 




 Has anyone else reported Foldit or Eyewire causing the 'blue screen of death'? Or is it just coincidence? 




 That website has a .mil ending. 

Doom^TM is ugliness layered upon ugliness. The words 'modern military' conjure up images of Americans killing Pakistani families with Xbox controllers. And yes that is going on. 




 Linking it there shouldn't discount my arguments (which you can respond to if being logical should take your fancy. lol!). If I had submitted it to /r/getUndisciplined however...  




 So that's what they mean when they say 'butthurt'... 




 You can subscribe to religious ethics without realising you are subscribing to religious ethics.

 **Protestant work ethic** *n.* the view that to be successful through hard work is a person's duty and responsibility, which, according to Max Weber's analysis, first evolved in Protestant Europe through the teachings of Calvin. 




 Another reason it is called that is that the video game industry obeys that holiest of capitalist maxims - thou shalt not kill the cash cow. (Sometimes Moses reminds me of myself...) 




 Thought so; you were just blustering.  




 You should look at /u/rawkuts's example. I hope she is able to change some of your views too. 




 Very good. 




 How much of it do I have to play before I 'help science'? 




 * I know I'm not the only one who thinks it's a ridiculous name so you're wrong there.

* Why is it called that? and Does it involve killing?

* Just because someone is a good artist doesn't make them a good person. I'd rather have Eminem as an associate than a son-in-law. And by 'old school games' I take it you're not referring to chess? 




 Wrong, wrong, wrong.

I was trying to discourage those, (perhaps you fall into this category, perhaps not), who stumble blindly in the hell-realm that is addiction to video-games. I know a man who is in his thirties and plays video games. People mock him behind his back about it, and he has admitted to me that he feels 'shame' (his word) about his habit. True story. I, out of compassion, would like to save others from his fate.

And, **I was trying to encourage** the rays of hope out there, (One must never abandon hope. It was not without reason some Catholic theologians called despair 'the one unforgivable sin'), the comparatively enlightened video game apologist (like rawkuts) into singing in this chillest of chill lands. 

I don't know what you are or aren't envious of. I can assure you however that the video game prison looks less attractive from the outside than from within.

Perhaps drugs can help one ['to strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield'](http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/174659), perhaps they can't. One thing for sure is that they make for a better [Lotos](http://www.bartleby.com/42/638.html) than does video games. 

Edit: added brackets for clarity 




 Is there greater wisdom than: 'Forgive them, Father. They know not what they do'? If there is, is that what you were employing with your snide dismissal of Lucas in your second paragraph? You might think I'm being facetious but this exchange, I believe, highlights precisely the foibles that civilised fellow-produce-of-the-Big-Bang and enlightened 'fellow passengers to the grave' shouldn't have. 




 What on earth do you know about Buddhist teachings on ego and pride?

 It wasn't merely smug condescension. When I was a philosophy undergraduate at university they said the SEP was often more advanced than our purposes required. Equating an unknown Reddit user with an undergraduate philosophy student is not condescension (unless, perhaps it occurs in a sub such as /r/Academia). 




 Best comment yet. Still looking at your first link. The first comment to make me think of delta-ing someone. (Such a shame that it looks like a dunce's cap, though. Why couldn't they have picked any other letter?) 




 a) The science seems to state that video games do have a negative effect - http://www.psychology.iastate.edu/faculty/caa/abstracts/2010-2014/10ASISBSRS.pdf. Read that and see if you then disagree. 

b) Other things being bad does not mean that video games are good.

c) I think you missed some of the subtlety of my original explicatory comment. I said that any good engendered by games is nullified by the pallid tone in which they cast 'reality'. Perhaps you'd like to tell me more about Spec Ops. My prejudices are telling me that, going on the first two words alone, the game is not one made by a devotee of Francis of Assisi or the Lord Buddha! Please disabuse me.  




 The suggestion that an American soldier could possibly not be morally corrupted I consider risible. (If that's 'rude or hostile to other users', then sobeit. I'd find it rude and hostile to humanity for me not to say it.) 




 Everything is conditioning. I parse from your comment then that you subscribe to the 'Protestant work ethic'. I'd say that someone or something 'corrupted' you into thinking that. Additionally if I found other assumptions of yours that I believe don't cohere with reality I believe I would attribute them to either corruption or ignorance. 




 An overly jaundiced take on proceedings. 




 Sorry I had overlooked that. Some things strike different people as needing to be justified.

Here's one: [Violent Video Game Effects on Aggression, Empathy, and Prosocial
Behavior in Eastern and Western Countries: A Meta-Analytic Review.](http://www.psychology.iastate.edu/faculty/caa/abstracts/2010-2014/10ASISBSRS.pdf) 




 You truly don't see this?

Yes. It might help you to understand where I'm coming from if I told you that I'm beyond Good and Evil inasmuch as I think instead in regards to that which is *kusala* and *akusala* or 'skillful' and 'unskillful'. The idea that some people know more and are wiser than others is non-negotiable and incontrovertible to my mind.

Relevant: 

"Abandon what is unskillful, monks. It is possible to abandon what is unskillful. If it were not possible to abandon what is unskillful, I would not say to you, 'Abandon what is unskillful.' But because it is possible to abandon what is unskillful, I say to you, 'Abandon what is unskillful.' If this abandoning of what is unskillful were conducive to harm and pain, I would not say to you, 'Abandon what is unskillful.' But because this abandoning of what is unskillful is conducive to benefit and pleasure, I say to you, 'Abandon what is unskillful.'

"Develop what is skillful, monks. It is possible to develop what is skillful. If it were not possible to develop what is skillful, I would not say to you, 'Develop what is skillful.' But because it is possible to develop what is skillful, I say to you, 'Develop what is skillful.' If this development of what is skillful were conducive to harm and pain, I would not say to you, 'Develop what is skillful.' But because this development of what is skillful is conducive to benefit and pleasure, I say to you, 'Develop what is skillful.'"

 * I think my point was that video games become **more powerful** by virtue of their being **less open to interpretation**. I've not played Final Fantasy 10 (DAE think that is a ridiculous name. Like, 'Last of the Mohicans 2: Back with a vengeance!'). Is there a conscientious objector option or does one have to contort oneself into 'killer mode'?

* It wasn't an arbitrary statement/belief, sadly. I'm trying to help people. The lives that I will 'save' and the potential I will emancipate is worth my time. Of course it would be better if nothing had to be 'put down', that better world does not exist. Here in this world is suffering and dissipation. There are those things that lead to suffering and dissipation. And there are those who encourage, and those who discourage, those things that lead to suffering and dissipation. Often the opposite of dissipation leads to suffering. As often, and arguably more dangerous, is when the opposite of suffering leads to dissipation which then leads to increased suffering.

* Eminem has talent. I wonder what his 'Elegy for a Gamer' would sound like. Full of withering criticisms, no doubt! 




 *  I can't imagine anyone who wakes up in the morning and vows to devote themselves that day to the common good of all sentient beings

 There are people who do that. There are people who make the vow to do such a thing in a public ceremony. It is not uncommon in parts of the world.

* You are a 'moral relativist'. I am not. I am an 'enlightenment humanist' and, from the sounds of it, you are not. Our views of the world are incompatible.

* Hamlet may have said that but it is obvious he didn't believe it. 




 Was it the 'poverty of imagination' one?

May I ask that you not remove the comments of anyone who insults me. The insulting doesn't bother me, but the removal of potentially cogent content does. 




 I have played them and consider the time I spent on them time wasted. I do have acquaintances who play video games. I have noticed it having a detrimental effect on their 'lives'. A coldness, flabbiness, bareness characterised by grim companions and ethical indifference. 




 Poems can teach wisdom and represent beauty. Video games are more like sport without exercise. 

'When you pick up the controller something switches off in the heart.' 




 The 'I'd wager' prefix flags the conjectural basis of my comment. A conjecture not without reason however. I know, and have sources to prove, that commercial video games have been used to train killers in the past ([Marines being made to 'play' 'DOOM'](http://imgur.com/a/iImUQ#8WNhipK)), I can't think of any that have been made to instil caring into nurses or competence and compassion into doctors and surgeons. 




 Note my 'otherwise healthy' bit. 




 'Violence' and 'rampant capitalism' are 'life-skills'. I just don't think they're particularly noble ones.

 If it makes someone happy, how is that a bad thing?

You don't believe that such a thing as corruption exists?

[In 1904, Elizabeth "Lizzie" Magie designed a board game to demonstrate the tragic effects of land-grabbing.

Anyone interested in traveling a non-trivial distance has to pony up for a railroad ticket. Anyone desiring light and water had better open their wallet.

 Reddit has a real-world application (research and propagandising, for example) which makes it disanalagous with video games. 




 What's your point? 




 How is what you choose to spend your time on morally superior to what a person who plays video games chooses?

Because I try to engage with things that are helpful, salubrious, or improving (- 'That makes better; spec. that improves the mind, understanding, or character; that makes agricultural improvements.) I believe that she who plays video games does not do so for reasons as noble as my motivators. 




 http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/action/#NatActAge

http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/personal-autonomy/

Are these helpful or would you rather something more basic? 









 I can't imagine anyone who wakes up in the morning and vows to devote themselves that day to the common good of all sentient beings would decide to spend the day playing board games in front of the television. 

Nonetheless, I will say a few words in their favour. Board games at least (usually?) require human contact so they have that going for them. 

With television, the consumption of the content can obtain with the agent's agency comparably intact. I am presented something, and then   I am beholden to no-one (not event the writer or director or leading lady) as to what opinions, and conclusions I have. I can 'make of it' what I like. With a video game I have to acquiesce with its creator to consume the content. Whatsoever she considers a door, I have to see as a door. Whatsoever she considers a task, I must consider a task. Whatsoever she considers the goal, I must assume as the goal. Whilst, one cannot 'fail' at 'The Godfather' (1972: Paramount Pictures) through being aghast at the characters' misdeeds, one could never possibly win at 'The Godfather: The Game' (2010: EA Games) without having to replicate (via your *avatar*) acts 'fearsome' and cruel.

An insect is capable of making the sort of decisions involved in Tetris. A human life wasted on such things is a sad thing however. If I was feeling poetic I'd say (after [Blake](http://www.poetryloverspage.com/poets/blake/to_see_world.html), of course)

      A Tetris brick that falls right down

      Touches the heartstrings without a sound. 




 * I am trying to say "it's so immoral you cannot justify using it". 

* Life has bigger, bolder, more pressing, and more puzzling puzzles than any video game. Ergo, those bigger, bolder, more pressing, and more puzzling puzzles will provide better braining training. 




 * The first article you quoted was awful. 

 So the fact that video game players are better at
'using a joystick and looking one way while reaching in a different direction' shows they are better at 'laparoscopic surgery'? I'm glad that no one actually believes that playing video games makes one a qualified surgeon. I'd wager that the surgeons who play video games would be worse surgeons than those that don't because they would take life less seriously and value human life less.

* 'Brain flexibility'? What kind of newspeak is this? I'd rather have a strong intellect, or a keen perception than a flexible brain. Quisling had a flexible brain. If I was a military general, I'd like recruits with 'flexible brains'. All the better to turn them from men to animals.

 And, surprise, surprise! Look who funded the study:

This research was supported by Air Force Office of Scientific Research (www.afosr.af.mil) grant FA9550-10-1-0268, Army Research Laboratory (www.arl.army.mil) grant

* I think the acid test to that would be if on your deathbed you wished you had played more video games. If you're telling me you believe you would, you have either my disbelief or my contempt and pity. 




 I think I also anticipated some of your thrust with my 'otherwise healthy' caveat in my explicatory comment above. 




 To state that one has the choice between 'seeking entertainment' and 'silently contemplating the mysteries of the universe' is a false dilemma and shows, if I might be so bold, a poverty of imagination.

Do I believe that with this precious human life, with so many different things to do, finding ways simply to 'pass the time' is a waste of time? Yes I do. The time will pass whatever we do. It is our responsibility to use it well. 




 * I have played, seen, and can name a video game.

* I am talking about the universe in which this 'morality system' takes place. If one were to 'save a tribe of villagers from a volcano' on a video game one would, on one level of consciousness, associate saving tribes of villagers from a volcano with what you did whilst playing that game. The necessary meaninglessness of the video game world (i.e. its video game-ness) has a toxic influence on a 'morality system' that has to exist in the world outside the game console, television and gamer ecology. The difference between saving a tribe of villagers and not saving a tribe of villagers on a video game has no effect on the number of lives lost (except perhaps that of the 'gamer', but that's an argument for elsewhere). The difference between saving a tribe of villagers and not saving a tribe of villagers - in real life - does have an effect that can be equated in terms of suffering caused and human lives lost. The 'morality system' cannot be equivalent or comparable between the two 'worlds'.

* 'Brutality beyond the minimum' is a phrase that has been forged by video games, I'm sure. I'll leave you to work out the irony. Correct me if I'm wrong.

* I don't think 'concomitantly' is a particularly difficult word. Let me know if you still don't understand what it means.

* It was George Lucas. His comments can be read here: http://www.theverge.com/2013/6/13/4427444/lucas-spielberg-storytelling-in-games-its-not-going-to-be-shakespeare-usc  




 In your examples the simulators are being used qua medicine/therapy not qua games. My argument is that in cases where they are 'merely games' they have no utility. 




 *All* video games. 




 In and of itself, no.

 **The Ladder of St. Augustine**

BY HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW

* * *
     
     
     Saint Augustine! well hast thou said,
     
      That of our vices we can frame

     A ladder, if we will but tread
     
      Beneath our feet each deed of shame!


     All common things, each day's events,
     
      That with the hour begin and end,

     Our pleasures and our discontents,
     
      Are rounds by which we may ascend.


     The low desire, the base design,
     
      That makes another's virtues less;

     The revel of the ruddy wine,
     
      And all occasions of excess;


     The longing for ignoble things;
     
      The strife for triumph more than truth;

     The hardening of the heart, that brings
     
      Irreverence for the dreams of youth;


     All thoughts of ill; all evil deeds,
     
      That have their root in thoughts of ill;

     Whatever hinders or impedes
     
      The action of the nobler will; 

     

     All these must first be trampled down
     
      Beneath our feet, if we would gain

     In the bright fields of fair renown
     
      The right of eminent domain.

     

     We have not wings, we cannot soar;
     
      But we have feet to scale and climb

     By slow degrees, by more and more,
     
      The cloudy summits of our time.

     

     The mighty pyramids of stone
     
      That wedge-like cleave the desert airs,

     When nearer seen, and better known,
     
      Are but gigantic flights of stairs.

     

     The distant mountains, that uprear
     
      Their solid bastions to the skies,

     Are crossed by pathways, that appear
     
      As we to higher levels rise.

     

     The heights by great men reached and kept
     
      Were not attained by sudden flight,

     But they, while their companions slept,
     
      Were toiling upward in the night.

     

     Standing on what too long we bore
     
      With shoulders bent and downcast eyes,

     We may discern  unseen before 
     
      A path to higher destinies,

     

     Nor doom the irrevocable Past
     
      As wholly wasted, wholly vain,

     If, rising on its wrecks, at last
     
      To something nobler we attain. 



















 **A GURU - WOULD I TRUST ONE? (Analytical Meditation)**

- Did I educate myself, who taught me the things I know? 


- Could I have learned to talk, read, write without relying on a teacher? 


- Could a sceptical 6-year old ever learn to read, without having a positive and open attitude? 


- Is it possible that other people know more than me? 


- Do trustworthy people exist at all? 


- What qualities would I expect of a real spiritual teacher? 


- Would I recognise a real spiritual teacher when I met one? 


- Would I like to have a spiritual teacher to make good progress or just to get rid of the responsibilities for my own life?

**Dumur**: How was the new edition of Nietzsche's Complete Philosophical Works established?

**Deleuze**: The problem was to reclassify the posthumous notesthe Nachlassin accordance with the dates Nietzsche had written them, and to place them after the works with which they were contemporaneous. Some of them had been used in an abusive way after Nietzsche's death to compose The Will to Power. So it was essential to reestablish the exact chronology. This explains why the first volume, The Gay Science, is more than half composed of previously unpublished fragments dating from 1881-1882. Our conception of Nietzsche's thought as well as his creative process may be profoundly altered as a result. The new edition will appear simultaneously in Italy, Germany, and France. But we owe the texts to the work of two Italians, Colli and Montinari.

**Dumur**: How do you explain that Italians rather than Germans did the job?

**Deleuze**: Maybe the Germans were not in a good position to do it. They already had numerous editions, which they were fond of, despite the arbitrary organization of the notes. Also, Nietzsche's manuscripts were in Weimar, East Germanywhere the Italians were better received than any West German could have hoped to be. Finally, the Germans were undoubtedly embarrassed at having accepted the edition of The Will to Power created by Nietzsche's sister. Elizabeth Forster-Nietzsche put together an extremely harmful work that privileges many Nazi interpretations. She didn't falsify the texts, but we know well enough that there are other ways to distort an author's thinking, even if it is merely an arbitrary selection from among his papers. Nietzschean concepts like those of "force" or "master" are complex enough to be betrayed by a selection such as hers.

**Dumur**: Will the translations be new?

**Deleuze**: Completely new. This is especially important for those writings toward the end (there have been some poor readings, for which Elizabeth Nietzsche and Peter Gast are responsible). The first two volumes to be published, The Gay Science and Human, All Too Human, have been translated by Pierre Klossowski and Robert Rovini. This doesn't mean that the prior translations by Henri Albert, and by Genevieve Bianquis, were badnot at all. But if they were determined to publish Nietzsche's notes with his works, they had to begin from scratch and unify the terminology. On that note, interestingly enough, Nietzsche was first introduced in France not by the "right," but by Charles Andler and Henri Albert, who represented a whole socialist tradition with anarchical colorings.

**Dumur**: Do you think a "return to Nietzsche" is taking place in France today? And if so, why is it?

**Deleuze**: It's difficult to say. Maybe there has been a change, or maybe the change is taking place now, with respect to the modes of thought which have been so familiar to us since the Liberation. We were used to thinking dialectically, historically. Today it seems the tide has turned from dialectical thinking toward structuralism, for example, as well as other systems of thought.

Foucault insists on the importance of the techniques of interpretation. It's possible that in the actual idea of interpretation is something which goes beyond the dialectical opposition between "knowing" and "transforming" the world. Freud is the great interpreter, so is Nietzsche, but in a different way. Nietzsche's idea is that things and actions are already interpretations. So to interpret is to interpret interpretations, and thus to change things, "to change life." What is clear for Nietzsche is that society cannot be an ultimate authority. The ultimate authority is creation, it is art: or rather, art represents the absence and the impossibility of an ultimate authority. From the very beginning of his work, Nietzsche posits that there exist ends "just a little higher" than those of the State, than those of society. He inserts his entire corpus in a dimension which is neither historical, even understood dialectically, nor eternal. What he calls this new dimension which operates both in time and against time is the untimely. It is in this that life as interpretation finds its source. Maybe the reason for the "return to Nietzsche" is a rediscovery of the untimely, that dimension which is distinct both from classical philosophy in its "timeless" enterprise and from dialectical philosophy in its understanding of history: a singular element of upheaval.

**Dumur**: Could we then say this is a return to individualism?

**Deleuze**: Yes, but a bizarre individualism, in which modern consciousness undoubtedly recognizes itself to some degree. Because in Nietzsche, this individualism is accompanied by a lively critique of the notions of "self" and "I." For Nietzsche there is a kind of dissolution of the self. The reaction against oppressive structures is no longer done, for him, in the name of a "self" or an "I." On the contrary, it is as though the "self" and the "I" were accomplices of those structures.

Must we say that the return to Nietzsche implies a kind of aestheticism, a renunciation of politics, an "individualism" as depersonalized as it is depoliticized? Maybe not. Politics, too, is in the business of interpretation. The untimely, which we just discussed, is never reducible to the political-historical element. But it happens from time to time that, at certain great moments, they coincide. When people die of hunger in India, such a disaster is political-historical. But when the people struggle for their liberation, there is always a coincidence of poetic acts and historical events or political actions, the glorious incarnation of something sublime or untimely. Such great coincidences are Nasser's burst of laughter when he nationalized Suez, or Castro's gestures, and that other burst of laughter, Giap's television interview. Here we have something that reminds us of Rimbaud's or Nietzsche's imperatives and which puts one over on Marxan artistic joy that comes to coincide with historical struggle. There are creators in politics, and creative movements, that are poised for a moment in history. Hitler, on the contrary, lacked to a singular degree any Nietzschean element. Hitler is not Zarathoustra. Nor is Trujillo. They represented what Nietzsche calls "the monkey of Zarathoustra." As Nietzsche said, if one wants to be "a master," it is not enough to come to power. More often than not it is the "slaves" who come to power, and who keep it, and who remain slaves while they keep it.

The masters according to Nietzsche are the untimely, those who create, who destroy in order to create, not to preserve. Nietzsche says that under the huge earth-shattering events are tiny silent events, which he likens to the creation of new worlds: there once again you see the presence of the poetic under the historical. In France, for instance, there are no earth-shattering events right now. They are far away, and horrible, in Vietnam. But we still have tiny imperceptible events, which maybe announce an exodus from today's desert. Maybe the return to Nietzsche is one of those "tiny events" and already a reinterpretation of the world.

     Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed 

    The dear repose for limbs with travel tired;

    But then begins a journey in my head 

    To work my mind, when bodys works expird:

    For then my thoughtsfrom far where I abide 

    Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee, 

    And keep my drooping eyelids open wide, 

    Looking on darkness which the blind do see: 

    Save that my souls imaginary sight 

    Presents thy shadow to my sightless view, 

    Which, like a jewel hung in ghastly night, 

    Makes black night beauteous and her old face new.

    Lo! thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind, 

    For thee, and for myself no quiet find. 
 



















 At that sound the bent shape of the king sprang suddenly erect. Tall and proud he seemed again; and rising in his stirrups he cried in a loud voice, more clear than any there had ever heard a mortal man achieve before:

  Arise, arise, Riders of Thoden!

  Fell deeds awake: fire and slaughter!

  Spear shall be shaken, shield be splintered,

  A sword-day, a red day, ere the sun rises!

  Ride now, ride now! Ride to Gondor!

With that he seized a great horn from Guthlf his banner-bearer, and he blew such a blast upon it that it burst asunder. And straightway all the horns in the host were lifted up in music, and the blowing of the horns of Rohan in that hour was like a storm upon the plain and a thunder in the mountains.

   Ride now, ride now! Ride to Gondor!

Suddenly the king cried to Snowmane and the horse sprang away. Behind him his banner blew in the wind, white horse upon a field of green, but he outpaced it. After him thundered the knights of his house, but he was ever before them. omer rode there, the white horsetail on his helm floating in his speed, and the front of the first ored roared like a breaker foaming to the shore, but Thoden could not be overtaken. Fey he seemed, or the battle-fury of his fathers ran like new fire in his veins, and he was borne up on Snowmane like a god of old, even as rome the Great in the battle of the Valar when the world was young. His golden shield was uncovered, and lo! it shone like an image of the Sun, and the grass flamed into green about the white feet of his steed. For morning came, morning and a wind from the sea; and darkness was removed, and the hosts of Mordor wailed, and terror took them, and they fled, and died, and the hoofs of wrath rode over them. And then all the host of Rohan burst into song, and they sang as they slew, for the joy of battle was on them, and the sound of their singing that was fair and terrible came even to the City. 



















 *"If you started in the wrong way," I said in answer to the investigator's questions, "everything that happened
would be a proof of the conspiracy against you. It would all be selfvalidating. You couldn't draw a breath
without knowing it was part of the plot."*

*"So you think you know where madness lies?"*

*My answer was a convinced and heartfelt, "Yes."*

*"And you couldn't control it?"*

*"No I couldn't control it. If one began with fear and hate as the major premise, one would have to go on the
conclusion."*

*"Would you be able," my wife asked, " to fix your attention on what The Tibetan Book of the Dead calls the
Clear Light?"*

*I was doubtful.*

*"Would it keep the evil away, if you could hold it? Or would you not be able to hold it?"*

*I considered the question for some time. "Perhaps," I answered at last, "perhaps I could  but only if there were
somebody there to tell me about the Clear Light. One couldn't do it by oneself. That's the point, I suppose, of the
Tibetan ritual  somebody sitting there all the time and telling you what's what."*

[Aldous Huxley, 'Doors of Perception', 5758]


**I. General Introduction**


A psychedelic experience is a journey to new realms of consciousness. The scope and content of the experience
is limitless, but its characteristic features are the transcendence of verbal concepts, of spacetime dimensions,
and of the ego or identity. Such experiences of enlarged consciousness can occur in a variety of ways: sensory
deprivation, yoga exercises, disciplined meditation, religious or aesthetic ecstasies, or spontaneously. Most
recently they have become available to anyone through the ingestion of psychedelic drugs such as LSD,
psilocybin, mescaline, DMT, etc. [This is the statement of an ideal, not an actual situation, in 1964. The
psychedelic drugs are in the United States classified as "experimental" drugs. That is, they are not available on a
prescription basis, but only to "qualified investigators." The Federal Food and Drug Administration has defined
"qualified investigators" to mean psychiatrists working in a mental hospital setting, whose research is sponsored
by either state or federal agencies.]

Of course, the drug dose does not produce the transcendent experience. It merely acts as a chemical key  it
opens the mind, frees the nervous system of its ordinary patterns and structures. The nature of the experience
depends almost entirely on set and setting. Set denotes the preparation of the individual, including his
personality structure and his mood at the time. Setting is physical  the weather, the room's atmosphere; social 
feelings of persons present towards one another; and cultural  prevailing views as to what is real. It is for this
reason that manuals or guidebooks are necessary. Their purpose is to enable a person to understand the new
realities of the expanded consciousness, to serve as road maps for new interior territories which modern science
has made accessible.

Different explorers draw different maps. Other manuals are to be written based on different models  scientific,
aesthetic, therapeutic. The Tibetan model, on which this manual is based, is designed to teach the person to
direct and control awareness in such a way as to reach that level of understanding variously called liberation,
illumination, or enlightenment. If the manual is read several times before a session is attempted, and if a trusted
person is there to remind and refresh the memory of the voyager during the experience, the consciousness will
be freed from the games which comprise "personality" and from positivenegative hallucinations which often
accompany states of expanded awareness. The Tibetan Book of the Dead was called in its own language the
Bardo Thodol, which means "Liberation by Hearing on the AfterDeath Plane." The book stresses over and over
that the free consciousness has only to hear and remember the teachings in order to be liberated.

The Tibetan Book of the Dead is ostensibly a book describing the experiences to be expected at the moment of
death, during an intermediate phase lasting fortynine (seven times seven) days, and during rebirth into another
bodily frame. This however is merely the exoteric framework which the Tibetan Buddhists used to cloak their
mystical teachings. The language and symbolism of death rituals of Bonism, the traditional preBuddhist
Tibetan religion, were skillfully blended with Buddhist conceptions. The esoteric meaning, as it has been
interpreted in this manual, is that it is death and rebirth that is described, not of the body. Lama Govinda
indicates this clearly in his introduction when he writes: "It is a book for the living as well as the dying." The
book's esoteric meaning is often concealed beneath many layers of symbolism. It was not intended for general
reading. It was designed to be understood only by one who was to be initiated personally by a guru into the
Buddhist mystical doctrines, into the premortemdeath rebirth experience. These doctrines have been kept a
closely guarded secret for many centuries, for fear that naive or careless application would do harm. In
translating such an esoteric text, therefore, there are two steps: one, the rendering of the original text into
English; and two, the practical interpretation of the text for its uses. In publishing this practical interpretation for
use in the psychedelic drug session, we are in a sense breaking with the tradition of secrecy and thus
contravening the teachings of the lamagurus.

However, this step is justified on the grounds that the manual will not be understood by anyone who has not had
a consciousnessexpanding experience and that there are signs that the lamas themselves, after their recent
diaspora, wish to make their teachings available to a wider public. 




      Joyful to have
     Such a human birth,
     Difficult to find,
     Free and well-favored.	

     But death is real,
     Comes without warning.
     This body
     Will be a corpse.

     Unalterable
     Are the laws of karma;
     Cause and effect
     Cannot be escaped.	

     Samsara
     Is an ocean of suffering,
     Unendurable,
     Unbearably intense.
