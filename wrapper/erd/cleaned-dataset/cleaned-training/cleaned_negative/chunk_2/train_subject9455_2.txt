 This was excellent information. Thanks for your replies. If an experimentalist happens to read this please tell us of your experiences. 




 I'm interested in research as well. Though I can't say I would know what to expect. Should I be able to fit some time in for research one semester I will certainly do it. What was research like for you as an undergraduate?
