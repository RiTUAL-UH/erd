 Yep.  Right in the article:

 Discouraging bullying for gender identity is great.  Eliminating all forms and reasons for bullying would be even better.

 I remember hearing Japanese pronouncing Sacramento as Sacrament. Your explanation seems right.  They know, for example, that the English word is not guide-o and that the appended *o* is due to following Japanese rules.  In the case of Tront they've omitted not only the final *o* but have over-corrected to achieve *tr*. 




 We would only be renting and have no children.  We would only be using public transportation.

Are there any places in the hill country where we could meet a fair number of English speakers? 




 Thanks again.  Varanasi was one of the places I visited many years ago.  Mostly what I remember is the Ganges and the ghats,both the bathing ghats and the burning ghats.  Good luck with your research. 




 Thanks for the advice.  So having them on call means paying for their services when you use them, right? 




 My months in India confirm what you say about no in-between.  

We have no expectations of Western standards.

What places in the northeast do you like?  Does Lucknow qualify? How about Ranchi?  I really loved Darjeeling but I wouldn't expect many English speakers there. 




 Thanks so much for a full response.  We appreciate all your tips.  You may be *hungry* but don't seem *foolish*. 




 Thanks.  As we have friends in Bangalore, that sounds like the best choice.  And we could do without air conditioning since the climate is moderate.   




 Thanks.  Are there plenty of English speakers in all those cities?  What's your main reason for saying South or West? 




 I recently had a couple of visits to my VA medical center and was handled at least as well as at my previous HMO.  Even asked about getting a future appointment moved up and they said come in tomorrow around 10am.  I showed up at 8:30 and was quickly registered.  Sure I waited for the procedure but I got out of there about 2pm after a CT scan and was happy with the whole procedure.  They were actually more efficient than the HMO but the HMO experience was years ago. 




 so that they can defend **against** it...  Right? 




 I had been having increasing lower back pain for a couple of months.  My physician did nothing except give the okay for me to take nightly ibuprofen and acetaminophen.  Spent $25 for a brief session with a chiropractor at my local gym and he relieved most of the pain in that session.  Probably the best $25 I ever spent. 




 The table is not intended to represent the true tax burden to either the corporation or the individual in the listed country. 
 




 These pieces are all worth reading but I found the one by Roger Schank especially compelling: 

To learn to predict well, one needs to be educated about how to predict and one needs to make predictions and to examine what went wrong when those predictions fail. Curiously the schools teach none of this.

The idea that kids can make predictions is not a really radical point. My point is that prediction has to be the curriculum and not be ancillary to the curriculum.

 




 Kale and chard are good too.  Tasting the greens is something to relish, not avoid.  Just go at it gradually. 




 If we really believed that accountability works, wouldn't we have accountability for all public servants? Why do we not require our legislators to make "Adequate Yearly Progress"? We have the data from their congressional districts, do we not? There is crime data, health care data, poverty figures, and drug use statistics for every state and federal legislative district. Why, exactly, do we not establish annual targets for our legislators to meet? 

Excellent interview.
 




 Thanks for the advice. 




 No offense taken.  Thanks for your perspective from the repair side. 




 Where in the world is killing a giraffe not like shooting fish in a barrel? 




 Yeah, I hadn't understood a triple entendre correctly.  Three-word pun it is. 




 A really old triple I enjoyed was the suggestion of what to call a cattle ranch that a man is setting up for his boys:  Focus.  (Where the sons raise meat.) 




 President Obama tells us that he's asked the Pentagon whether the conditions of confinement of Bradley Manning, the soldier charged with leaking state secrets, "are appropriate and are meeting our basic standards. They assure me that they are."


If Obama believes that, he'll believe anything. I would hope he would know better than to ask the perpetrators whether they've been behaving appropriately.

Even if you believe Manning deserves punishment, this is unconscionable.

 Yeah, the yellow pins on your world map look like they're near AU/NZ but they don't indicate actual distances or travel time.

We had 3 months each in AU and NZ in 2007.  Well worth the time.  Especially NZ.  Their maps had scenic roads marked but I told them I would be better to mark unscenic roads since they only had a couple in the entire country. 




 Did you mean to skip New Zealand and Australia when

 Not at all persuasive for me.  I found it superficial. 




 As far as I'm concerned it Ith'nt kuil.  Reminds me of the programming language APL -- so dense a person can't figure out their code an hour after they wrote it. 




 Put a half-gallon pitcher of water in the fridge with 3 or 4 herbal teabags in it.  (My favorites are licorice and spice.)  Just enough flavor and the cost is low.

 I found the emphasis to be more on the time it takes to arrive at forgiveness than whether to forgive at all.  Reminds me of hearing one of the South African members of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission saying that Americans are much too quick to offer what amounts to a shallow forgiveness. 




 Wow, we're all over the place with our comments here.  Connoisseurs recommending fine Scotch, two-buck Chuck fans, Miller Lite as a worthy purchase.  (As a drinker of stout, something like Miller Lite ranks with Kool-Aid.)

I remember reading some wine reviewer who said box wines were perfectly okay, just depending on what's in them, as is the same with bottles.

I asked my local Grocery Outlet to stock 5-liter Merlot or Cabernet Sauvignon.  Some while later I found a pallet of Almaden Shiraz for $5.99 a box.  Sorry to say I only bought 4 boxes because there hasn't been any more.  I should have bought the whole pallet. 




 How can you think critical thinking skills are exempt from genetic influence? 




 But while fertility is determined by culture, an individuals predisposition toward religion is likely to be influenced by genetics, in addition to their upbringing.

If there's a religiosity gene, maybe there's a gene that influences the desire for more children. 




 You've got some extra unnecessary redundancy there. 




 There are some issues that cross political boundaries -- accountability, transparency and oversight.  Even moderate Republicans can support some version of these.  The devil is in the details though, so they can be twisted into their evil twins -- bureaucracy, loss of control, nanny-state regulations.

We need to use framing and repetition to promote our version of those issues.  The right wing has mastered framing and repetition.  We should take a note from their play book.

 The headline isn't the OP's, it's from the original article. 




 The real Dominant Paradigm -- the one held by the overwhelming majority of people on the planet -- is more decentralized and amorphous, yet is grounded in shared values that merit enunciation. These include: a belief in the virtues of community; a desire to be part of something greater than oneself; a reciprocal relationship with nature and life's essential resources; an aversion to open hostilities and devastating warfare; an interest in the wellbeing of others as a precondition of personal prosperity; an adherence to culturally-transcendent principles such as the Golden Rule; and a willingness to work hard in return for an equitable existence. 




 1.	On the first legislative day of a new Congress, the Senate may, by majority vote, end a filibuster on a rules change and adopt new rules.

2.	There should only be one opportunity to filibuster any given measure or nomination, so motions to proceed and motions to refer to conference should not be subject to filibuster.

3.	Secret "holds" should be eliminated.

4.	The amount of delay time after cloture is invoked on a bill should be reduced.

5.	There should be no post-cloture debate on nominations.

6.	Instead of requiring that those seeking to break a filibuster muster a specified number of votes, the burden should be shifted to require those filibustering to produce a specified number of votes to continue the filibuster.

7.	Those waging a filibuster should be required to continuously hold the floor and debate.

8.	Once all Senators have had a reasonable opportunity to express their views, every measure or nomination should be brought to a yes or no vote in a timely manner.

 Some cities are using alternative voting, usually some instant runoff system.  I'm hopeful that successes at lower levels could spread upwards.

Some years ago I read/heard an interview with a guy, I think Kalle Lasn of Adbusters, who had worked with anti-tobacco advertising that was successful in reducing the incidence of young people taking up smoking.  You may remember the ads with a cigarette that looked glamorous until it drooped in a display of impotence.  He wanted to do similar things with social issues but was prevented by the media's ability to deny advocacy advertising.  When the interviewer pointed out that even if he were allowed to create such ads, the money backing them would be a pittance against what the monied powers could amass.  Kalle (or whoever) replied that they didn't need to blanket the airways -- with just a foot in the door they could do serious damage to the conventional wisdom.

 Many years ago I heard of a man who single-handedly killed a leopard.  I don't remember if there was any explanation of how he did it but the 'fact' of it was common knowledge among his coworkers.

Seems like a wolf would be easier because of lacking the raking ability of the hind claws. 




 Nope, California. 




 All I know is from spending 3 months there in 2007.  We paid way too much for internet time (5-10 NZ$ per hour).  But if you were there permanently you wouldn't have to pay by the hour. 




 A lot of you youngsters aren't nearly radical enough for me.  Quite a few of us senior citizens in my community are progressive. 




 I'm nave enough to think there are some cross-partisan issues that promise a broad appeal.  **Transparency, accountability, oversight.**  I realize the far right doesn't like these but they line up with notions we learned in Civics class about how democracy is supposed to work.  

Voting reform is important and would increase the percentage of voters if they thought their vote made a difference.  [Range Voting](http://rangevoting.org/) has impressed me the best but almost any alternative to winner-take-all would be an improvement.

Changing the ability of media to deny advocacy advertising would open a wedge for some creative [culture jamming](http://www.adbusters.org/).

There would be plenty of opposition to these kinds of issues but at least they ought not to splinter any movement of ours internally.

 In all the comments about moving, nobody has mentioned New Zealand.  Too far away? 




 Rationality, the idea that individual's purchase decisions are based on value or perceived value in a product, and that firms are motivated by profit-seeking is rarely far from the truth.


What do you think of behavioral economics?  I've only read Dan Ariely, Barry Schwartz, Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein.  But they leave me persuaded that there's a lot more irrationality than you seem to think. 




 Nothing in the headline was just my opinion.  It's all from the article. 




 Robert Reich is a **political economist** and his article is titled **The Big Economic Story**.  So maybe there's some overlap between politics and economics. 




  We knew that, politically, once you get it into law, it becomes almost impossible to remove it. Thats not a bad legacy. The fact that we were able to lay the trap does feel pretty good, to tell you the truth.


Disgusting.
 




 Unifying and simple, yes.  How about transparency, accountability and oversight?  These should have appeal across the spectrum.

 We're talking about a major political party, which will control much of Congress next year, possibly undermining the strength of the country -- on purpose, in public, without apology or shame -- for no other reason than to give themselves a campaign advantage in 2012.

Maybe now would be a good time to pause and ask a straightforward question: are Americans O.K. with this?
 




 Do these fit in here? -- months of the year in the modern calendar, days of the week. 




 About some doctors in the Nazi death camps:

They would do what they could to help, except for the most important thing of all, which is they wouldnt question the existence of the entire death camp itself. So they would find themselves working within the rules, however they could, to try to improve conditions marginally. And in retrospect, of course, thats just not sufficient. And as a longtime activist, I see myself and other activists doing the same thing, that what we do is we do everything that is allowed by those in power to attempt to stop their destruction. But the problem is, whenever we figure out a way to use their rules to actually stop them, they change the rules.
 




 Hey, in 1968 I voted for Eldridge Cleaver.  And in 2008, Cynthia McKinney.  No turn to the right for me. 




 I'm one of those who thought so.  I also thought the country was too smart to elect Reagan president.

So now I'm one of the old generation.  Not all of us are in your way. 




 This is unconscionable:

Now they are using their political power and control over the media to attack Social Security. 

This effort is being led by billionaire investment banker Peter Peterson. Mr. Peterson has personally profited to the tune of tens of millions of dollars from the "fund managers' tax subsidy," an obscure provision of the tax code that allows billionaires to pay a lower tax rate than schoolteachers and firefighters. However, Peterson believes in giving back. He has committed $1 billion to an effort that is intended to take away the Social Security benefits that people have worked and paid for.
 




 It's worth reading all 20 of his points, not just #16 that all the comments mention so far.

 Absolutely we need broader cultural change, a paradigm shift. I wasn't looking for a magical solution.  Anyway, you don't think introducing it in middle school is a bad idea, do you? 




 The OP said *sometimes* so your fix didn't correct much. 




 Start introducing it in middle school. 




 One automaton, two automata, three automata, four... 




 My generation has devised a system in which one man can make enough money in a year to pay the salaries of every police officer, firefighter, and public school teacher in the city of Chicago, while paying a lower percentage in taxes than the people cleaning his offices. That's why many of you young people don't have a job. 




 No need to disdain the girl for saying no.   




 "some idea" != "exactly" 




 The Republicans have done their best to make this election about fear and hate. That is their brand of sand.

Democrats are cooperating nicely, by refusing to engage in a values debate.

The only question is, why?

For many people the answer is simple: voters don't really have a choice; the political process is nothing more than a Kabuki dance in which both sides represent corporate America and the uber-rich, while playing their respective roles in public.

That answer is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Believing it makes it so.

But even if it's true, we, the people are the only power capable of changing that reality. We can start by refusing to drink the sand.

 I had a monkey as a kid, a vervet.  One of her traits was that she was extremely jealous.  She would scold anyone she thought was getting too much of my attention and even bite them if she could.  Since then I've thought that monkeys aren't very good pets.

Was Abu jealous? 




 For a religion that is pretty much free of greedy, powermad leaders, look at [Unitarianism](http://uua.org/).

 Man, what a lot of great advice here.  Follow even half of it and you'll be in good shape.

About starting young:  I once heard a comparison between someone who saves a fixed amount over a period of 30 years from the age of 35 until 65 vs someone who saves the same amount over an 11-year period from 19 to 35, and then keeps the money in investments.  At age 65 the early saver has about **twice** the amount as the late starter.

The distinction between needs and wants is critical.  Keep a list and when you see something you want, make it a point not to buy it right away but add it to the list and review and prioritize the whole list before buying anything big.  Make sure the list includes all the responsible stuff such as the 6-month or 12-month emergency fund.

When you're in a store being tempted by some shiny toy, take of picture of it.  You'll find an even more tempting toy soon -- take a picture of that too.  Soon you'll have a photo collection of ephemeral wants that will make you smile embarrassedly like reading your diary from third grade.  




 No one mentioned giving up A/C.  Even without reading the article you can see it's talking about "lavish use" and "reducing our dependence."

 More than my trimmed-down selection. :) 




 After decades of hyper-militant consumerism and its attending alienation, and a national consciousness spun from pure capitalist bullshit and mirrors, it is testimony to the American people that they can still see to piss straight, much less recognize any sort of truth whatsoever. Yet, a portion of Americans are beginning to grasp the truth about what has happened to their country -- that it has been bought and paid for by an elite class in a nation that is supposed to be classless. 




 The ruling class holds all the money, not to mention the media that informs the populace as to what is going on in our country. It controls our health care, our banking and retirement funds. It controls our education or lack of education, and it controls the price, quantity and quality of the food we eat. It controls the quality of the air we breathe, and soon, through pollution credits, even the price they will pay for that air. Most importantly, it holds concentrated legal and governmental authority, not to mention the machinery of both parties to grant itself more authority. 




 We no longer take effective action, because it has become impossible to identify what we might do to change anything. Instead, we react to events. That is what the ruling class wants, because if we are reactive, then outcomes can be controlled by controlling the stimuli. 




 You never hear them say it, but neo-conservatives understand that they have a mean streak down inside. They also know if they want to share in the national plunder, they must win hearts and minds. They must look pious and sound right while lying through their teeth and picking our pockets. In other words, they have an astute grasp of American politics and business -- which are the same thing, of course. 




 I have seldom met an American who understood how the ruling class got so rich. Simply put, it was through constant cultivation of bigger and more labyrinthine government, creating legal and technical complexities to sluice money nationally and globally in their direction, and to cover their asses in the process. 




 America has always had a ruling class, and it has always bullshitted the world that it doesn't. But at least the ruling class of the past was interesting and varied, because diverse sorts of Americans were getting rich. 




 Nobody in Washington disputed the ruling class's right to dictate policy. After all, the political class agreed with the ruling class's major premise: The public does not know shit, never has, never will. 




 Both parties forced banks to make high rate home loans to people who people who did not qualify, because the inflated home values during the expanding bubble would make billions for big investors who knew when to get out. Should they stay too long at the fair and go bust, they would set up the howl of "too big to fail." 




 This political class stands between all of us down here and the tiny minority in the ruling class waaaaaay up there, wherever the hell up there is. No use to squint. You can't see it from where we are. That comes in mighty handy in denying the existence of a ruling class. 




 Reaching out to independents or "moderate" Republicans couldn't hurt though, huh? 




 Thanks, I'll check it out. 




 All I've read so far is the talk by Jonathan Haidt.  I found it to be outstanding and it makes me want to read all the others. 




 Redditculous. 




 If war were undisguisedly as nasty and brutish as it truly is, it might also tend to be short.  Soldiers freed from illusions might mutiny, as many did in Vietnam, or desert and go home.  But this modern, cushier kind of pseudo-war is different.  


The odd thing is that no one seems to question the relative cushiness of this life at war (nor the inequity of the hardscrabble civilian life left behind) -- least of all those best able to observe firsthand the contrast between our garrisons and the humble equipment and living conditions of Afghans, both friend and foe.  Rather, the contrast seems to inspire many soldiers with renewed appreciation of "our American way of life" and a determination to "do good things" for the Afghan people, just as many feel they did for the people of Iraq.  


Most infantry missions are "presence patrols," described by one officer as "walking around in places where we won't get shot at just to show the Afs [Afghans] that we're keeping them safe."  


In a typical mess-up on the actual terrain of Afghanistan, Army experts previously in charge of this base had already had a million-dollar suspension bridge built over a river some distance away, but hadn't thought to secure land rights, so no road leads to it.  Now the local American agriculture specialist wants to introduce alfalfa to these waterless, rocky mountains to feed herds of cattle principally pastured in his mind.

 That's one theory but not the likeliest one.  There are [others](http://www.randomhouse.com/wotd/index.pperl?date=20000913). 




 It would appear that this applies to politicians pretty much all the time. 




 I don't care if you went into a stall just to spread disinfectant on your hands -- when you come out of a stall, ffs wash your hands.  The symbolism of the thing is as important as the real health aspect.  I wouldn't want your shoe on my dining table even if it's brand new out of the box and has been disinfected. 




 time appears to be running out on monoculture and many other standard practices of agribusiness, just as it is on so many of the thoughtless ways the civilized world does business. One clue to this: When a problem arises, we fight back with more of the same, except in higher - more lethal - doses. Indeed, that impulse, to *fight back*, to turn everything into a war, rather than to study, ponder and revere our obstacles, is the ultimate manifestation of our unawareness. 




 How about making all error messages selectable so the user can do a cut-and-past with them? 




 You appreciate being able to help others -- wouldn't some of your friends appreciate hearing about your dark thoughts?  Could you try it with one of them who is most likely to listen without trying to fix anything?  

Maybe it doesn't help to remind yourself that you're denying others the very thing you like to provide for them.  But a two-way would likely be more deeply satisfying than a one-way.
