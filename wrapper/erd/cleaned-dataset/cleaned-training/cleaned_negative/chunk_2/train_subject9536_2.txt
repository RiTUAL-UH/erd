 I know a couple games that we have done before. 

The first is beer dodgeball, which could be it's own event all together. It's played like regular dodgeball but when you get hit, you have to chug a beer in order to get back in. Once you've finished the beer you are allowed to continue playing. Once you throw up, you're out. Great way to get really drunk. 

The second game isn't so much a game but it could be made into one, Dunk-a-Roos. You fill a trash can with water and ice. Next you get a beer ready to shotgun. Then you dunk you're head in the water for 10-20 seconds. Then you shotgun you're beer. Like I said not really a game but it's an awesome thing to do especially on a hot day when your fraternity is having a day party. For an added thrill, have some brother hold your feet up when you dunk your head in like a keg stand.
