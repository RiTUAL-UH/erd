 Best: Lighting JR on fire during their interview

https://juicemakesugar.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/kanejrfire.gif 




 But reasoning changes and they can very well change their minds on certain talents that they have previously said no to.  They can also bring in older guys like they have with Rhyno or Kendrick to give a little boost to the star power there and give these up and comers established wrestlers to work with. 




 "It's time to clean the plates!" 




 What am I supposed to be looking for?  Every match listed [was announced last night](/spoiler) 




 By bringing in more big named indie talents to have those names as well as the normal development guys.  They have people like Uhaa Nation, Samoa Joe, etc coming in 




 True... the right mix of main roster and NXT women's wrestlers will make for an amazing match.   




 Actually Naomi, Nikki, and Alicia Fox are all good in the ring.  They just get put with others that aren't as good which holds them back. 




 It is meant to be that they are going to go for a back body drop  




 I care 




 I get why they let him go,  but ken Anderson 




 Because they stopped him wrestling 




 Like the hhh trunks or the scsa ones 




 It's not a myth but it's not super common knowledge 




 Yup Patterson put it right in that son of a plumber's pooper 




 But it's THE MOST ELECTRIFYING MOVE IN AAAAAAALLLLLLL OF ENTERTAINMENT! 




 Vince and Pat Patterson used to spit roast Dusty Rhodes 




 Wow! Dick much? 




 Except for Cena if I'm not mistaken 




 Some say Puppet H is hitting it on Road Dogg to this day 




 That's not what I meant by protected.  I meant it's protected in that it is rarely kicked out of, with the exception of big matches (i.e. Taker at Wrestlemania matches) 




 Tombstone, Stone Cold Stunner, Rock Bottom.  Pretty much moves that only get kicked out of in big time matches 




 That is all this guy does when he posts and comments 




 You're an idiot... they are putting these guys in competitive matches with cena that showcase them and that they can hang with the top guy in the company.  You don't have to lose to someone to put them over.  Yes it can be done that way but it's not the only way.  But I don't expect you to take anything anyone says as legit unless they 100% agree with what you are saying so I guess I am wasting my time on a lost cause that is you. 




 Cum on Nicki! 




 Lobster Head! 




 Replace Sheamus with Neville

 I like how I get downvoted for enjoying a joke.  Sorry I'm not a puppet like y'all 




 Nice.. you get my upvote good sir 




 Yeah Jarret started fucking Angle's wife (well ex I believe at the time) and then they turned it into a storyline in TNA and they got married irl 




 This is legit the one thing that I had missed last night that I wanted to see... thank you 




 aka a "Gassy Canadian" 




 Because it's TNA and they are a sinking ship.  They are just falling hard.  And now there is GFW which has grabbed guys like Sanada and they are on the fast track to being better than TNA in terms of a company that is run well and in having a better product. 




 RIP you fat greasy mustard tiger 




 I knew, when this happened, that it wouldn't be long till someone did a Brazzers meme/gif/picture of it.  Very good stuff there

 Jesus Christ, what is with the fire crotch tat on that chick in the middle? lol 




 Not as good as Doink... hell not even as good as Dink 









 C'mon. The Red is a ~~good~~ song! 




 This has been posted so many times already 




 So that one match made the whole PPV a disappointment?  You say you're disappointed but then only talk about one storyline.  What about the BRC v New Day match, or the awesome I Quit match, or the Ryback v Wyatt match? 




 Mini-Shield-Reunion 




 You had me hooked until Chevelle.  God they are a horrible band 




 That is just awesome 




 Pepperoni, chicken fingers (not even the good ones) and the other two I forget 




 Roman Reigns for [Maybelline](http://i.imgur.com/MVKnrLJ.jpg) 




 You have obviously never had Merrimack water.  Makes Manchester water taste like Evian 




 Five Star Frog Splash, or any top rope splash for that matter 




 I loved the Angle/Joe feud at that point... such great stuff 




 Randy Orton's Kmart commercial

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YteUshVwCFU 




 I agree completely 




 Don't be a negative nancy 




 The curbstomp in theory is a good move... it just rarely if ever looks good when he hits it.  The set up is never believable in that his opponents would never irl just sit in that position long enough for him to set up and hit it.  




 I like how you just make up some bs about him being put in a comic tag team.   You have no clue what will happen with his character so stop jumping to conclusions 




 I was a fan before that... a Rosebud Hipster so to speak lol 




 "WHAT THE FUCK IS A HI-DIDDLY-DO!"  "NED FLANDERS IS YOUR HOOKUP, HOLLAR IF YA HEAR ME!" 




 Between injuries and being at times too outspoken I think they feel they may not be able to rely on him.  And I wouldn't say he is excellent in the ring.  He is good, but not excellent.  He can sell very well which he has going for him. 




 I never said anything about wwe being better or tna's being better.   Tna women's wrestlers could be the best in the world,  but if they aren't given the chance to go out there and give it their all then it doesn't matter if they are there.  




 It's supposed to be a play on tna changing people's names when they come in.   so William pumpkin smasher is Billy Corgan of the smashing pumpkins who is now doing creative

 And God said unto Abraham, you shalt kill your son Isaac.  And Abraham replied "OH MY GOD!" 




 Who the hell is Jorah Mormont? 




 Well Bryan obviously, but who is this CM Punk you speak of? 




 Whoever doesn't get RKO'd by Orton

 The jumping enzuguiri/kick that Roillins does when his opponent flips him on the ropes 




 At least they put the king "gimmick" on a Brit.  Nothing was more cringe worthy than Booker T and his fake British accent as King Bookah 




 Because Ryback embodies things that Wyatt doesn't like.   




 Vintage divorces John! 




 How does buying TNA change anything?  WWE had Gail Kim, Kong, Taryn.. and nothing was any different.  It's not in who you have, it's in how you handle who you have. 




 I stand by my words, and don't plan on taking them back lol 




 Rosa Mendes, Cameron, Pre-Kendrick Eva Marie 




 I like how the writer includes King Mo in the list of "important" people that left.  Like King Mo did anything for their product. 




 Ricky Steamboat is one I have never heard anything bad said about 




 How in god's name is Eric Young coming off as legit psycho?  He has hands down the worst heel characters.  The world elite thing was ridiculous and now he is this hairy angry man.  He is one of those wrestlers that will always be better as a face. 




 Don't be a maa facka...  




 Ziggler is a poor man's Mr Perfect

Summer Rae is a poor man's Maryse

 




 Don't appologize... I was just messing with you too lol.  I got what you were going at lol, especially given your username 




 The slow pan up from behind on Mark Henry during his entrance.  Always a good way to accentuate his size and stature.  




 Uhaa Nation 




 Jumped up and tore his anus 




 Mehaa Republic 




 I'm implying activities that Hornswoggle has been engaging in while not on television.  Nothing sexual in what I stated.  So the better question is what are "you" implying? 




 "It was me r/squaredcircle!  It was me, u/MetsFan4Ever all along!" 




 The movie [Small Soldiers](http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20090323014200/smallsoldiers/images/a/a5/3160383925_42e04a99fc.jpg) 




 Kip Ziggles vs. "The Hennigma" Joey Axel 




 A good one?

 I'm afraid I've got some bad news!  It seems that our beloved boss Mr McMahon will be stepping down as CEO of the company and will be replaced by Mr Kevin Dunn.  Thank you very much! 




 Things Hornswoggle has been doing in his absence from TV 




 Jimmy Snuka was from Fiji 




 Terra? 




 Make sure you watch Live in Fuckin Dublin... great stuff there 




 LOLCENAWINS exists because some jabroni online decided they would try to be cool and create something because they were upset that someone was scripted winning matches. 




 after I did... you just said it better 




 The underhook facebuster... simple enough 




 Wyatt has been getting feuds, solid promo time, and a Mania match with Taker.  That is thriving.  Reigns won the Rumble and faced Lesnar for the title at Mania and is still in the title picture.  That is thriving.  Rusev had an extremely long undefeated streak and held the US title and is having matches with the top dog of the company.  That is thriving. 




 It was intended to be because he was bad mouthing the authority and so they were cutting his microphone to stifle him 




 So the fact that we have so many talents from NXT thriving on the main roster means nothing?
