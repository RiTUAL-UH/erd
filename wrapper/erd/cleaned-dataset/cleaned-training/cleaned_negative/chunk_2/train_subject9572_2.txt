 No pun intended. 




 I just asked my wife and she said, sure I'd do it.  She is tech oriented but that kind of blew me away. 




 Most impressive is the material from which the mirrors are made and the process used to form/polish the secondary's and tertieary's surfaces.  




 I'd say that's a pretty good estimate.  Imagine a plasma tornado 2 to 3 times the size of the Earth. Kind of makes an F5 Earth bound tornado seem tame. 




 I wonder how accurate and reliable this test is.  Any data available?

 Amazing how they captured the crashing sounds of the CME ;-) 




 Well put. 




 I concur with what you're saying, but one point of correction:

 Many particles, such as electrons, are considered "point particles" in that they have zero dimension and take up exactly zero space. They have zero mass as well, and as such, travel at the speed of light.

That is not correct. You may be thinking of a photon. An electron does have mass and does not travel at the speed of light, maybe close but not equal to c.  




 Agreed.  A great many of the empirical tests they ran in '59 would now be run through simulation on a computer. 




 Not sure, but I'd like to know. 




 No, the headline is correct - the first thief reports the (implied second) theft to the police.  Reread the story. 




 I have them an use their color options on occasion.  I agree with Algorab.  The app definitely needs an upgrade.  

I cannot find a way to make the timer in the app be permanently set.  The timer appears to need a confirmation each cycle to retain its on/off timing settings - what good is that?  Anyone have better luck than me with the timer? 




 I don't think a shuttle was docked with the ISS when this photo was taken.  The photo appears to have been taken on 4 Jan 2012 and the last shuttle (Atlantis) docked with ISS on 10 July 2011. http://www.space.com/12230-shuttle-atlantis-space-station-final-docking.html

 According to Flava the amount is fair because the movies in question were downloaded a total of 6,632 times.  




 It represents the search for knowledge, for things larger than ourselves, and for our origins.  Plus the things you find there are just fucking amazing. 




 Correction: Except for the mass that has recently been pulled in from outside of the black hole.  But that is insignificant relative to the mass within the singularity. 




 Yes, all of the mass is located within the singularity, not distributed throughout the black hole.

 I find it very surprising Apple's graphics chipsets don't support H.264 encoding in Macs as late as early 2011 given 1) how firmly Apple supported this standard and 2) the chipset is in iPads but not Macs.  Does Air Parrot perform the same function in software?

 Favorite part of S05E01: Jesse comes up with the idea to use a magnet.  




 Good question.  I would guess the overall mass of the proton is the determined by the quarks' direct interactions with the Higgs field plus the mass equivalent of the interaction energy between the quarks interacting with the Higgs field.  Otherwise the proton's mass would just reflect the measly sum of the three quarks' mass.

 I have a V shaped scar on my side just below my ribs. Happened when as an 8 year old I was climbing a tree with a friend.  He was out on the end of a branch and i was near the trunk on the same branch.  He climbed out a bit too far and branch gave way. We both fell.  He fell into a mud puddle and I fell onto a wire fence which impaled me in my side.  Luckily no internal organs were damaged but I received 32 stitches in the shape of a V.  I'm amazed I don't have a fear of heights and still like to climb. 




 Ah, I see it is but from another paper (NY Times vs CNN). I checked for the same link before I posted but didn't check for other similar links. My bad. 
 




 Yes it does, but it didn't here. Some people who check the LosAngeles sub reddit may not have visited the other sub reddits that contain this link.

 Check out the D8 interview. My wife attended and during the Q A at 1:26:35 she asked Jobs a good question about DHCP. 
 




 Good answer - thanks. 




 That would make much more sense. 




 That was a request, not a demand. 




 Camera settings were: 200 mm, f/40 1.6 sec, ISO 6400.  I used three layers of 5% visible light transmission window tinting film.  I think that means there was only 0.05 * 0.05 * 0.05 = 0.000125 (0.0125%) transmission.  That would explain why I needed such a high ISO setting and exposure time. 




 The Milky Way looks WAY to small relative to the Earth.

 Western Canada is in the path of the partial eclipse so at least you get to see something (see animation above). 




 Interesting.  I've tried this with other color balloons and red seems to work best.  Some other colors don't pop at all.  That would imply red absorbs this laser light better than other colors. 




 Electronista has more info on this http://www.electronista.com/articles/12/05/11/domestic.shipments.ups.fedex.unaffected/.  You could be referring to this statement in the article:

A reveal will take place on May 7th that will aim to provoke conversation on what being in business means to Australians. 




 My wife noticed it while we were catching up on season 6.  She had just interviewed Robert and he showed us the products he's invented.  I wouldn't be surprised if there are other TV commercials of his products on Dexter episodes. 




 Good point, I should've posted that.  Robert was very careful about spoilers. 




 She clearly is a non technical person who should not attempt to convey technical concepts. 




 They have to shut down the LHC every winter because its high energy requirements are not compatible with the sourrounding population's higher energy needs during the winter (i.e. not enough power to do both).

 Freaking weirdest funeral procession I have ever seen, probably due to North Korean editing. Commentators are over the top with emotion. The background moaning is a bit much and clearly looped. 




 yep 




 The light source in the middle of the Einstein ring is a luminous red galaxy (LRG) as stated in the text, not just a single star.  It looks like a star since it's so far away and all of the stars in the galaxy appear to be collapsed to a single blob. Sniperchild is correct that the galaxy has a black hole in the middle, as almost all galaxies do.   




 ditto 




 A single atom does not have sufficient density to form a black hole because an atom is mostly empty space - very small nucleus surrounded by a relatively large cloud of light electrons. You have to get rid of the electron cloud and compress the nuclei of multiple atoms to get a sufficiently high density. 




 The point of the article is that a mass of 3x the sun is sufficient, but just barely, to form a black hole.  This does not mean that all stars with a mass of 3x that of our sun are or become black holes.  It requires special conditions for a black hole of such a low mass to develop from gravitational collapse of a star.  Also, black holes with a mass much less than our sun are postulated to exist.  These primordial black holes do not form from the gravitational collapse of a star but are remnants from the big bang.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primordial_black_hole 




 These are pretty cool, but Day 25 with the dual deer heads looks like a law suit waiting to happen.

 One word: Cajones! 




 Not clear why he would need to be arrested for the investigation, unless he isn't cooperating with the authorities. 




 I believe Vegas is starting to take bets on this one. You could really score big time with this precise knowledge! 




 Well stated.  

I'm convinced that in addition to science   technology influencing scifi, the converse is true as well.  I'd like to think people who make decisions that affect society in significant ways are influenced by the type of messages Star Trek delivers.  But even if not, positive change can come in small ways by people like us. 




 Yeah, I noticed that.  I think his/her thought was in the right place even if the words were not. 




 I hear you. 




 And the white one is still to be released.

 Agreed, and is that a button I see in the upper right? 




 Yes he is - no fluff on what he says. 




 Oh, that's a softball.  Batter up!... 




 Found the resolution  - only 500 x 500.  You can get an enlarged version at 665 x 665 but still poor.   




 Still looking for it.  Will post when I can find it. 




 You're right - we know of no planets within a 100 light years that could support life capable of receiving our broadcasts.

However, SETI isn't about someone else receiving our broadcasts - it's about us receiving someone else's broadcasts.  If some day they are received, those transmissions will likely have been traveling much longer than 100 years. 




 I see that it has been posted elsewhere in reddit, but I don't see it repeated in TechNewsToday.  Did I miss another post?

 That umbrella would be toast if it were a real lightning strike, but it seems to be intact. 




 Tell him to imagine himself poised precariously on a ledge 20 stories above the street. Then tell him he has the potential to release a lot of energy by simply jumping and plummeting to his death. Lots of blood, broken bones and a high probability of losing his life. Where did it all come from? Potential energy that was turned into kinetic energy then impact. Then  ask if he believes in potential energy. 




 Yes, the Very Long Baseline Array is impressive, but it is an interferometer with lots of spatial ambiguity.  This array would yield more of a focused main beam with very low sidelobes.  That is one of the reasons the individual arrays are somewhat randomly rather than periodically placed.  

The toy comparison was a bit charged.  I am completely enthralled by the LHC and can't wait for full power operation.  I was only indicating it is small in size compared to this array. 




 That's like saying "The pixel on a CCD would fit comfortably in this period."  But that's not the entire sensor.  Sure the central region would fit in the LHC, but the entire collection of arrays spans over 3000 km (see the end of the video).  The LHC at about 9 km in diameter is tiny compared to the entire array.  This array would derive its very fine spatial resolution from its large dimension.  That is what makes it impressive, not the central region by itself.  

Admittedly, this array may never be built.  But the scope would be impressive and the performance unprecedented if it were. 




 Our Sun is quite a dynamic star. 




 Yeah, that's annoying.  SAI seems to enjoy spreading these things over many pages, probably to get more hits. 




 Yes, but in addition the odd shaped earth shows the strength of gravity varying around the globe with the yellow and red areas being the strongest and the blue areas being the weakest.
