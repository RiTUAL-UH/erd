 This is very sad considering that most mental illness can be cured with proper medication  









 Of course there's money  




 Wow thanks for sharing that I mean some architects are in it for the money. But I think you found your passion. Keep it up!  









 So what will happen ? Will you get back the amount that they charge you with?  




 How much did you get it for ?  




 This just tells us that life is more than what we learn in school. Giving up something you love and never regretting your decision is the most noble thing a person can do. Im pretty sure cameron lyle would make a great impact not only to the person he saved but also to alot of people going through the same thing  




 Ok thanks and im sorry  



















 interesting cars
