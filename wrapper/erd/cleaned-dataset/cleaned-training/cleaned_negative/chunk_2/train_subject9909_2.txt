 Out of the night that covers me,

Black as the pit from pole to pole,

I thank whatever gods may be

For my unconquerable soul.

-

In the fell clutch of circumstance

I have not winced nor cried aloud.

Under the bludgeonings of chance

My head is bloody, but unbowed.

-

Beyond this place of wrath and tears

Looms but the Horror of the shade,

And yet the menace of the years

Finds and shall find me unafraid.

-

It matters not how strait the gate,

How charged with punishments the scroll,

I am the master of my fate,

I am the captain of my soul.

-

 Romans, Greeks Persians, and so on Eastward. I would expect only urbanized peoples to have this social ritual due to the increased expediency of human interaction in close quarters, as opposed to most days in rural life.

 Look at all these great posts with active discussion. I was just rolling down looking around, adding tabs to go read them and I muttered out loud... I love this sub. My eye had caught how many had lots of comments and I knew most would be productive to the participants.

My wife was walking to the kitchen for a glass of OJ and was like, "hmm?"

I just wanted to say that even just viewing the activity here makes me feel on top of things, which is all some of us want so I and mine can jump on a good opportunity to help or flee. 









 [The interview is wonderful](http://www.grindtv.com/outdoor/excursions/post/husband-wife-row-pacific-ocean-high-fat-diet/). I found it on Facebook through a [Fat Head](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcNPfZlrZs) fan group.

 **You are now the fastest pair and mixed pair to ever row across the Pacific, the first couple to row from California to Hawaii, the first Finnish person to row across any ocean, and Trulia is in an ongoing acquisition by Zillow for $3.5 billion in stock. You must feel on top of the world. So whats next for you?**

 I try not to cling on to any accomplishments or results, whether they are good or bad. I like moving forward, staying active, and building new things. After catching up on sleep a bit, my life will hopefully include more of all those things. But probably no more rowing for a while!

What do you think?

The page isn't clear whether they mean support or legal eligibility, but its just a facebook meme so I don't expect much. Legal eligibility is ludicrous in my opinion. Restricting the field of candidates like that is asking for trouble.

More and more, I'm thinking a president just needs to have the priorities, principles, and political support. The first two make him a candidate, the third gets him in. Service in the armed forces supports the third part. Military service definitely puts people in a hotbed social environment where many will decide who they are and what they believe - galvanizing them to stick to what they discover for life. This, the ingrained posture, vocal respect, and personal grooming habits are what draw civilian voters to military candidates.

Obviously, none of these are specially reserved to candidates from our armed services.

What seems to set them apart is first-hand knowledge of the place where so much of our tax money goes, where people say our freedoms have been won, and where many of our American heroes come from. The mainstream calls every soldier a hero - but this isn't the case. [You know it isn't.](http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/12/the-tragedy-of-the-american-military/383516/) Military culture is filled with rascals and fools, pompous jerks and outright destructive personalities. Civilians have a problem relating to what they see, and do not spend enough time reading about or talking with service members to understand the full picture. Assuming the people who rise tot the top and then put in a lot for president know the financial and internal political situation is unreasonable, but you never see them tested publicly.

Many have not served, but why can't they prove to voters that being inside the armed services isn't the same as *knowing* the armed services? 





























 [Matterport](http://matterport.com/) is a new product and related service which enables the rapid scanning of a building's interior, [viewable online in browser.](https://matterport.com/try/)

This [blog post](http://www.valueoc.com/2015/01/05/2015-year-matterport/) sings some pretty high praises, so I thought I'd ask here.

The website for OC Matterport, mentioned in the blog, works ok in IE. Doesn't work in Chrome, so I found [their Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/ocmatterport/timeline).

I have been following Matterport for a while. They use Microsoft Kinect sensors and custom software. Packages for scanning from the company start at $299. The device costs $4,500 and Matterport controls their own hosting services with year plans valued at increments of $500 (three tiers).

That means the company has to scan at least 130 homes of minimal size per year with one full time employee. I wonder how fast the price of OC Matterport increases.

 Anyone seen the irony of statists protesting, saying that their rights are being oppressed and they need more protection... even though by many definitions they think their rights come from the government? So how are their rights being crossed if they are not legislated, yet? How can they conceive of asking for a right before it is voted on?

[This started bugging me after I watched this clip of Monty Python's Life of Brian.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFBOQzSk14c) Their intent may be to joke at the whole situation or just one perspective, I don't know for sure.

Of course I'm not talking about illegal stuff happening which are obvious offenses against people's objective rights as humans. 




 If a company is to form to manage and adjudicate contracts, it must verify the language, assets, and persons in each case. The person traditionally given this responsibility is the lawyer - or a notary. Notaries usually have all the powers of a lawyer except the ability to try a case before a court of law. 

Do you think a law company will employ notaries directly [as the French government does](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notaire), or should they be hired directly by private citizens to review contracts [as Americans do.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notary)

Seeing as a company would have to review the contract before agreeing to it anyway, I see companies putting out standard contracts forms like Legalzoom but keeping notaries on hand for custom work. This then enables them to let customers use either self-reporting or freelance notaries for basic and rote contracts. 














 I do not have children, yet, but my coworker and I had a discussion about his teenage son who is grasping internet security more slowly than hoped. The father's approach has been largely hands-off, but he realizes this isn't working. The child has a small gaming addiction, has lost money on scam trades, and has riddled his laptop with viruses to the point when it was brought into a specialist he commented it was the worst he'd ever seen.

Most of us grew up alongside the early internet. We can tell a sketchy website from a respectable one. We know the premise of scams enough to weed out most offensive encounters. Most importantly, we know to ask questions of communities and be generally cautious. Some of us even know to RTFM.

A brief search yielded to me only product pages and advice against revealing personal information. Nothing about not clicking the flashing "10,000th VISITOR" buttons (and their devious descendants) or giving out gaming account info.

Are there any subs or resources on Reddit for this? Are there any very good books on the topic? 









 A lot of black scribbles, red eyes, and fearsomeness. 









  ...we need a way to ensure that scientists publicly announce which studies they are going to run, what methods they will use, and how they will analyze the data, before running their studies.

I just read this article on [preregistration](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/2012/04/14/fixing-science-systems-and-politics/#.VHYQQTHF-rg) and wanted to ask Redditors what they thought about it and what is already happening in the field. That article is from 2012, but the author recently linked it in an article stating he still supports it. Reform in the science community is needed.

 With that much land, having a plan is necessary.

Do you have a plan? I noticed all the garden plots in the video, but most seemed to have been turned into lawn.

 I am just west of Baltimore, Md and am leaving my apartment in the middle of the lease. The lease dictates I pay rent for two months after I leave or until the apartment is occupied, whichever comes first and the rent will be pro-rated until occupied. I have one full months rent as security, but would like to make sure I escape the second. I can harp on my specific apartment, but the office can't push it due to fair housing laws.

I was in a junior apt. You get a wall between living/dining and the bedroom, but not an actual door.

One issue is that the area is close to areas of ill repute, but we don't have these problems in the apartment complex.

What websites should I use, make sure I submit reviews to, and whats the best way to get this in front of college kids? I just had the idea I should ask what colleges my building-mates attend.

Thanks in advance.

 Lets talk healthcare.

What websites do you use? Maybe there is a news service (or even a single story) you find helpful.

I've got to start somewhere, we need to vote with our dollars. But the websites I have found are all focused on sucking you into their plan (I can't blame them for following Always Be Closing) so they aren't much help unless I give them all my information. 









  ["As a Republican, Johnson was twice elected governor of New Mexico. As a Libertarian, success is defined as getting 1 percent of the vote... There are also plenty of Republicans in competitive races who deserve to have a Libertarian candidate running against them. Rand Paul isnt one of them."](http://rare.us/story/gary-johnsons-foolish-rand-stand/)

The point of this article is that running a strong Libertarian Party candidate would spoil Rand Paul on the issues. It would undermine his support just enough for Rand to lose. Rand is certainly going to be the most sensible person on the stage if no LP candidate runs. If we want better now instead of best never, then the LP should just butt out this year - or at least high profile candidates should not run.

If libertarians want best now rather than better, then I'd love to hear your plan and where you are going to get a billion dollar war chest from. Also how will you get your candidate to shake the hand of every eligible voter in the US - that is what it would take for them to even consider an LP candidate *right now*. No LP candidate will have the media coverage, name recognition, or party machinery to make a dent in the (I am being quite honest) wasteland of American intelligence on politics. You need those multipliers as a matter of fact.

The point is not for Rand to win using the %1.76 of the vote he might get, that is obviously not the case. **The point is to support him. Give him the volunteers. Give him the money. That is how he can win in 2016.**

All the volunteers and money going to the LP doesn't have the multipliers Rand has going for him - meaning the media coverage, the hype, and the support of the Republican Party.

_________________________________________________

I don't expect everyone supports Rand Paul in this sub. I am not taking for granted that this is a Republican sub and not a libertarian one. As a matter of discussing political strategy that should not matter. I want to hear if you want LP to run a strong candidate to spoil Rand in the primary. I want to hear if you think I am missing something. 




 You'll be scratching your chin and suddenly feel *that* hair.

We all get them, ingrowns, split hairs, infected follicles, acne, and... those thicker not-quite-normal hairs which you know are just the most wrong thing. They make us feel freaky and human. We pull them out (some come out so easily!), we cut them down, we stare at the goopy, dense, roots before flicking them off into the trash.

Does this mostly affect electric shavers? Regular groomers?

Whats the longest franken-hair you ever did see? Whats the most amount of hairs coming out of one follicle you ever pulled? 






















































 [Today Reddit found out about Silvio Gesell](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxdPIOUTd2k) via [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2i9sqm/til_a_man_called_silvio_gesell_once_created_free/). [The video has been seen previously on this sub](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/1mgs6h/silvio_gesell_currency_and_the_economics_of_money/). The phenomena is generally known as [The Wrgl Experiment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%C3%B6rgl#The_W.C3.B6rgl_Experiment).

Silvio Gesell's amazing shrinking money was like fruit.

Humans can trade in whatever means they wish. Most articles are traded today to indirectly gain goods and services later. We don't trade baskets for sheep, we trade baskets for dollars and then go trade dollars for sheep.

In a world of competing currencies, some are better stores of value than others. In a world of competing tradeable articles, most currencies fluctuate in value more than goods.

But fruit is not one of these goods. Fruit is only useful once it has reached a certain maturity, has certain provisions for care and preparation, and reduces in value over time - just like Gesell's currency.

There is a time and place for every money, but I think it is very funny to think of a whole town trading in fruit and would love for someone to show me who - if anyone or everyone - got the thin end of the pear in this case. Take us to the core of the issue. Explain how this currant-cy was actually a detriment; or maybe that this is a case of the right recipe at the right lime.

 I think Microsoft has been moving to hardware for some time - or at least hardware technology licensing - but only came to develop the Surface device with the hopes that public schools would use them in coming years.

Most of us remember taking plenty of state-run tests in grade school. Gaining information on students and schools has been a top-level topic for public school advocates and large publishers for about a decade. These groups got together recently to attempt to bring their vision of a 21st century school to fruition. All the ["future classroom"](http://youtu.be/mPUfwX4Nqy8) videos made by Microsoft, Pearson, HP, or non-profits have tablets and large interactive screens. Microsoft has [their vision](http://youtu.be/aJu6GvA7jN8) in heavy research, as seen in this [lab visit](http://youtu.be/rJ1p5SD3sOM)... well... part of it.

The other part is already in your hands.

Top publishers and education non-profits came together to create the Common Core standards for the United States. The Bill   Melinda Gates Foundation is the largest among the non-profits associated with the standards. These were created and then passed to the states via grant competitions. [The standards are picking up flak,](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peter-greene/how-the-common-core-lost-_b_5694139.html) but not only for how unworkable they are in the classroom. The standards also required legalizing and creating a series of databases for each state in which every school and child is tracked. They call it infant to workforce data tracking.

Some people out there have plans to put a tablet in every schoolchild's hands for the whole day.

As we have seen with the NSA, big data is a big topic and gets a lot of funding - yet officials there say they have no good ways of finding those needles of notable info once they collect the haystack of chatter. The education industry didn't get that message before anteing in but they can just go back to creating the old style books. Microsoft is close to turning a profit and has created an competitive piece of hardware which has not turned a profit yet (that I know of) and the company has no graceful way to slide out of the hardware market right now.

And those grant competitions? Billions of dollars were handed out which baited state and county school boards into spending increasing amounts of their budgets to keep up with the change in curriculum. Reports of boards being advised to buy stacks of books, only to have them go unused, can be found in every state which decided to chase the new standards. Many local school boards have been pretty sleepy, and some have been sleep-building expensive (and usually unnecessary) new school complexes. Their budgets are tight and teachers have been denied cost of living increases in a great many places.

That said, many parents are buying their children tablets, anyway, so if the state says each child needs a school tablet then who do you think would be made to buy them when the infrastructure to make schools able to use them is shriveling coffers?

With Common Core lying on the chopping block and all the other funding problems public and private education has, we can look at the picture with some more insight and try to figure out where Nadella will take the Surface - even if gradeschool education was not a goal in the first place.

So what do I take from this? What compromises or design choices did MS make in the first models that are no longer there, now? RT is gone, for one. Such a constricted OS doesn't make much sense for an adult, but for a child...

P.S. Yes, I don't like the standards, myself. I tried to give information here, and not any more opinion than that I think the Common Core standards are going to be discarded.

 HEMA, Historical European Martial Arts, is the study and practice of the ways of war and duels from Western culture.

Free for spectators, Longpoint is a HEMA tournament taking place at Turf Valley Resort near Ellicott City, MD. The pools of competitors have been whittled at for two days already - come and see the best of the best.

Watch talented men and women compete with synthetic and steel longswords, messers (a single-handed sword), single-stick (literally a rattan stick - fun and people wear little armor), and do cuttings (technique display with sharp swords).

I'm helping staff tables, but have trained in longsword. This is an amazing activity. We get into padded armor (not like sumo suits, think fencing) and the scoring system benefits those who can make a hit without getting hit back and those who completely control the exchange. You will see fast sword work, suspenseful moments, and skilled throws. You will also see tanks whose blows are terrifying and ladies who can take on any challengers.

 Why bother with flags of convenience? The information and assurances ports want guaranteed by a nation can be guaranteed in other ways.

I searched to see if this has been talked about here, and didn't see anything. Just had a thought and busted this out to talk about is and share.

TL;DR Steps  
1. Fly the black and gold to represent a ship as not registered with a nation.  
2. Use the internet or private resources to .  
3. ???? (Make trades and produce to enrich yourself through the market)  
4. Profit!

Is there a *need* for this? Maybe not a dire current need, but there is certainly a desire to remove one's property from the liability of registering to a state. Flags of convenience may not always be available so planning them away is prudent, profitable, and interesting.

##[Excerpt: *A GUIDE TO SHIP REGISTRATION* by the Government of New Zealand](http://www.maritimenz.govt.nz/Publications-and-forms/Commercial-operations/Ship-registration/A-guide-to-Ship-Registration.pdf)

 The registration of ships is a time-honoured practice. It began principally as a means of controlling ships entitled to carry 
cargoes within the seaborne empires of Europe. In more recent times, however, **it has proved a convenient means of 
establishing title to the property in a vessel** - in other words, who owns it. At the same time, **registration has served to 
determine which country's law governs the operation of a ship and the behaviour of those onboard** - key concepts which 
today play an important part in the international law of the sea. 
 
 Basically, **registration confers nationality on a ship and brings it within the jurisdiction of the law of the flag state**. Thus, a New 
Zealand registered ship is bound by New Zealand law - both its shipping and other applicable provisions - though the vessel 
may venture well outside the territorial limits of New Zealand. **A New Zealand ship abroad is accorded the protection of the 
Government of New Zealand**, much as a New Zealand citizen is while travelling overseas. **A vessel's bona fides are established 
by its registration papers** just as a passport establishes them for a person. **Registration may also determine criminal jurisdiction 
in the event of any incident or accident in international waters.**
 
 Further, registration facilitates financial dealings in ships - their sale and purchase and the raising of mortgages - and **brings 
back to the owner responsibility for any liabilities incurred**. It does so by evidencing title to a ship and thus declaring to all the 
world who owns a particular vessel.

 Emphasis mine.

Flying a flag of Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Belize, Bolivia, Cambodia, the Cayman Islands, North Korea, Georgia, Honduras, Lebanon, Malta, Mongolia, Panama, and Saint Vincent or the Grenadines is not going to afford the ship much protection in fact, flying these [makes you a target for inspection.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_convenience#Port_state_targeting)


* We live in the age of information. Independent ships can list themselves openly on the internet through a self-hosted internet site (which companies can glean and aggregate information from) or use a beacon to broadcast the relevant information locally.

* If states [want to impose regulations on ships](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_convenience#Environmental_effects), there are solutions. Ships can be registered into standards associations and companies.

* The ancap flag does not resemble any of the [International maritime signal flags](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_maritime_signal_flags), but I have not checked all of admiralty.

Just like bitcoin and other innovations in the realm of decentralization - there needs to be options for systems and applications. 

















































  Nearly 2/3 of all recent education graduates in Ontario are unemployed or underemployed the following year. British Columbia certifies nearly 3 times the number of teachers it needs each year. Even fast growing Alberta has seen many of its school boards laying off teachers in recent years.


 The question of what is a fair salary and remuneration package for public school teachers is a difficult one. I dont have an answer for it either. I do know that the masses of unemployed recent teaching graduates implies that the total remuneration package for teachers is above the market-clearing level. Schools do not want to hire more teachers because they cannot afford them. Incidentally this is one reason why the teachers union and school administrators cannot meet eye-to-eye on the issue of class sizes. Teachers want smaller classes, but administrators cannot afford to hire the number of teachers necessary for this at the current remuneration packages.

 These fresh graduates  bright eyed and bushy tailed  want to make a difference in a childs life. They cannot find work because of a union that has negotiated wages above the market clearing level.

  Let unemployed teachers replace unionized ones during a strike at a wage rate they negotiate with school administrators. If the teachers on strike are worth the money and conditions they demand, the school administration will be all too happy to reach a settlement with them to get them back in their class. And if not? In that case wed have a pretty strong signal that the remuneration package they received in the past was too generous.

 http://www.zotloeterer.com/welcome/

http://www.kourispower.com/

The Zotloeterer Turbine system and Kourispower system appear very similar, and I want to introduce you to them and explain the differences. **This is interesting because Kouris' original and only patents are different from what he is trying to sell now.** This is a personal and unprofessional work, and I have no connection or contact with either group aside from possibly sending an email to the Zotloeterer group a decade ago.

* A [vortex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vortex) forms when fluid rotates around an axis. Both system uses an outlet positioned to enable a vortex.

* The differences in systems come from how the water is coerced into forming a vortex and how power is generated. I will use "paddle" to refer to the exposed turbine of the Zotloeterer design and "turbine" for the submerged turbine of the original Kouris design. It seems "impeller" is a misnomer for a turbine in-line with the flow of water and filling the cross-section of a pipe.

##The Point

The installation called the Marysville Pilot Power Plant in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwqwLoc93ZI) and [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPIWSVhVHL0) is *not* the Kouris patented design. It does not primarily utilize the power generation feature detailed in the patent documents. Nothing you can see but the pipes and dam resemble the patented work. It uses a paddle and generator resembling the Zotloeterer design. Kouris says there is an impeller in the outlet pipe, as well, but obfuscates the matter. He concedes the impeller is a failed idea, but **I conclude** he keeps it to maintain a semblance of patent control.

Kouris also has a [two-episode feature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxxHdOmHEes list=PLD3902BBECFFF27CF) on Youtube. If you look at the patent and press release dates from Zotloeterer and then watch this, you can see a little problem. I don't know the guy, but I'd say Kouris is a liar. He uses poor terminology and doesn't have a scientific explanation that makes sense. All his language evades resembling the Zotloeterer system. That's sad, because the technology is good and admitting he doesn't have a patent isn't the worst thing in the world (unless he has a big ego that doesn't let him). Because Kouris has an inspirational origin story for the turbine design, but not the paddle design, I think it is safe to say he discovered Zotloeterer designs and copied the core concept.

Kouris says in the video his vortex uses the power of centripetal force but evades saying "gravity" and his brochure says ["operated using the kinetic energy created by the earth's rotation"](http://www.kourispower.com/wp-content/uploads/brochure20.jpg). The Zotloeterer Turbine is marketed as using "gravitational force," which it does (both do). Water falls because of gravity, a vortex just makes it also move horizontally on the way down. Unless Kouris thinks that the earth's spin pushes water out of springs and makes rain fall (both wrong), it sounds like he thinks vortexes form because the earth spins (very wrong).

Look at [this mock up of Kouris' original, patented, design](http://youtu.be/QZSq3alBS_o?t=9m45s) versus [this Zotloeterer concept](http://www.zotloeterer.com/attachments/Image/Fliessgewaesserstrukturen-2011.jpg?1391875144099). I saw the in-line concept in 2003 in high school - about when Kouris modified his plans. In that clip, Kouris is talking about the new design *with the old, discarded one onscreen.*

In the rest of this post, we can see all the reasons why Kouris left the old design behind.

##Structures

The *patented* Kourispower system exists freestanding in the middle of any standing water - generally a dam. A pipe outlet runs from a few feet under the surface of the water, straight down, and then out the bottom of the dam. A vortex forms as water is able to approach the outlet from every surface direction. [image](http://imgur.com/8tPZs7c)

The Zotloeterer system basin is located to the side of a stream with weirs. Water enters through an off-center inlet and exits by falling out the bottom through a central hole outlet. A vortex forms above the outlet through the assistance of the off-center inlet; this enables the basin to be placed out of the immediate path of the flowing water.

I realize the distinction may not be clear. Consider the placement and benefits of each system. Zotloeterer turbines are *to the side* of a *flowing water*. They are part of a living stream or river. Kourispower turbines are placed *in the middle* of *standing, dammed water*. They are scantly different from the internals of the Hoover Dam... except now there is a cool (and kinda dangerous) vortex! WOO STRAYA!

##Power Generation

Zotloeterer systems normally use a paddle on a shaft hanging below a generator as the power generation feature. Since there is only one axle, there is less to break and less to make. The generator is suspended above the basin with the paddle over the outlet, so it is spun by the vortex. Recent patent documents describe a feature which places the generator *in the paddle*. This makes it so that it is not an axle, but a pipe with a wire, that is lowered into the vortex. The paddle-generator appears small and fit for third-world applications where simplicity and being self-contained is traded for power production.

The Kourispower system patent details placing a turbine into the outlet pipe. The vortex does not drive the feature; the vortex was thought to increase the flow past the turbine compared to simply having a submerged pipe. This is similar to a traditional hydroelectric dam operation, but was intended to increase the flow enough that the system can generate relevant amount of power at smaller scales. The flow is not faster, and the turbine experiences less efficiency.

##Watts

 GWVPPs are hydro power plants for low head from 0,7 up to 2m and for a flow rate from 0,05 up to 20m/s and for a power range from 0,5 up to 160kW.

##Pros and Cons

|Kourispower|Zotloeterer|
|:-----------|:----------|
|Creates open vortex on surface of standing water|Vortex is contained in concrete basin|
|Requires fish ladders/ minces fish that go through turbine|Fish are proven to be safe to traverse basin and weirs|
|Requires dam to create still water for stable vortex in addition to head|Requires only head, usually from weirs|
|Problematic to screen from debris without interrupting vortex|Vortex can take small debris, large debris screen is before inlet|
|Susceptible to debris clogging|Flush gate can be operated to clear screen for large debris|
|Maintenance requires draining dam to below outlet|Inlet can be closed for work, moving parts above water|

##Patents

Both groups list where they are patented [K](http://www.kourispower.com/about/) / [Z](http://www.zotloeterer.com/welcome/gravitation-water-vortex-power-plants/patents/), but Zotloeterer goes a step above and has most of what you need to recreate their design posted, published, or in the patents. This is always useful for dreaming, scheming, or if they don't return your emails. I think patents are a little frivolous and prevent people from freely improving on other's work, but I don't think that is a discussion for this sub.

I had fun writing and formatting this, and I hope you enjoy it [and the formatting](http://reddittext.com/).
