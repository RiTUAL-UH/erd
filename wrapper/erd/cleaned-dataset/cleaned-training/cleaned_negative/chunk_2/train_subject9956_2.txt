 After playing a real obscene number of hours in Kerbal Space Program, I got into Simple Rockets pretty well, even landed on the Smoon and Smars - it is a bit easier thanks to being 2D - but I can't seem to be able to match velocity with rendezvoused-with ships. Docking was one of my favourite activities in KSP and I was quite good at it, but afaik there is nothing like relative velocity nullifying marker in SR. I managed to dock only once, and it was not very graceful, which is displeasing.
I don't know how to use that grey thing. 




 It was on Reddit some months ago, it was a project of a group of students of Spanish language. I need it quickl, thanks. 









 a) Every so often I experience a bug where the ship starts to rotate (using reaction wheels, it consumes power) by itself and only SAS keeps it in check and I can't get rid of it (not even by reloading). I suspect it has something to do with using physical/time warp or SAS toggling while rotating. Does anyone else experience this? How to get rid of it?

b) Is it possible to jettison an engine without having it set as an action group? 




 The beginning of the conversation is lost (it began at Omegle, it was basically that he is a Messianic Jew and he believes in the creation by Yahweh). This is copy paste of our email conversation (without names, emails and greetings); I would like to know what do you think of my reasoning, if I should improve something. Thanks.

 E.g. if I was dreaming about riding a rollercoaster which was about to smash into a wall, a cat jumping on me in the real world would project itself into the dream as the impact.

My brain doesn't have any way to predict the future, does it?

I don't think that the message needs to be spelled out. In this form it is quite obvious.

Aside from the message, it is extremely well done. 




 Hello!
I am quite fond of KSP, and this caught my eye as something I would surely enjoy (building bases/ships/...). It is on sale, however, I can't spend money on it this month. I would be very thankful to whoever would be so generous as to gift me,  and I make sure to pay it forward in the future. :)

 It was an issue we came upon today in school while discussing animal mistreatment. 









 This question occured me today - do the turning radars at KSP point at some specific point or trajectory in space? Is is possible that there are some undiscovered easter eggs? 







































 Fellow froods and froodesses!
Every Earth year on May the 25th, we hold a tradition of visibly carrying towels around with us, because on this date, there is a regular increase in flying saucers fly-bys, though we can't see them easily due to SEP field, and we have to be prepared for sudden untold adventures, Earth demolitions or serendipitious petunia materalizations.

In every case, this act also serves as a homage to Douglas Noel Adams, who ~~wrote~~ received from extraterrestrial beings this utterly extraordinary trilogy in five parts, and decided to share it with us.

Whatever happens this day, don't panic. Or every other day, for that matter...

Just reading this makes me sick. They use religion as an excuse to slaughter each another. It is surreal. 




 I am interested in reading Krauss's book Universe from Nothing, and I'd like to know if the recent discovery of gravity waves affect that hypothesis in any way, and how?

If this question makes no sense, I am sorry, I am no scientist. 


































 Ever since 0.23.5, I am often experiencing a weird time warp/gravity physics bug, where all parts of my vessel except the main part (capsule or whatever) go limp (as if in a freefall without horizontal speed), it becomes fixed (meaning it doesn't move and it is not affected by neither pressing keys or burning) and the trajectory changes rapidly even when not burning. When I try to time warp again it says that the time warp cannot be used under acceleration, or it disassembles rapidly. 

It happens in orbit around Kerbin. 




 I've seen a mod that adds giant asteroids (FSAA or something like that) as parts, but no mods that make them appear like vanilla asteroids. I understand that they would be virtually unmovable, but cool bases could be built on them. Is there any engine constraint preventing this? 














 I have passed both levels in practice tests, but I have a dilemma. I was almost bored when doing B2, but I am not very sure I can pass C1 again, though I did good in the practice test. 




 I run it on an old notebook (to process one chunk of data lasts several hours) and I don't know if I actually contribute to anything. And I heard some skepticims about whether one should run it. 

























































































 It seems to make the game a lot more realistic, if harder. Or there could be an option to toggle KSP/realistic gameplay.

What is the reason for not having incorporated it in the game yet? 









 Today I decided to play Ace of Spades Classic once again, so I go to a server and join the blue team. After changing several maps, one turns up where blue team is having its ass kicked really hard, when a message suddenly appear in the chat:

 We may not be winning in the game, but we are winning in our hearts.

Thank you, random stranger, for encouraging me a little.

 Come on sucker, lick my battery! 




 Do you think it had some connection to THE box or to Rainbow Power? Surely if she was studying somethingunrelated, they could just make her sitting and reading silently? 


































 She's an indoor cat, and we don't plan her to have kittens anyway, so we're going to get her spayed. I googled about it and what are the benefits, but I still feel bad about how drastic it seems and that she won't be able to reproduce. It is just sad :( 









 I sometimes go there to see what retarded things people say there, and it never fails me laugh. But it also enrages me a little, when I what turds can people spew of their mouths, and how ignorant some of them are - religion serves them as an excuse to not seek reason, to abandon critical thinking, to embarras themselves. Cattle do not see the stars and think they are special in the universe. In comparsion with immersity of the universe, we are uncomparably less than nothing.

I hope there won't be a shortage of people who publicly present reason, science, atheism etc. to people, because I have a grave feeling that it might actually be possible for the world to become a place where non-believers would be put ot death, if there would be no vocal opposition.

Just wanted to get this off my chest, carry on, or discuss it, if you wish. 














 I am watching Frozen right now (had heard that it is a nice progressive fairy tale) and it is well known that Disney movies work for majority of people, they can make people smile and cry at every age. Why exactly is that? 









 What if all those things with right arm are just a running joke to tease us, just like with the snail? Are there some solid pieces of evidence implying that he is really going to lsoe his arm?

I just watch the series, I haven't read comics or anything other yet. 














 [In the newest infostorm](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/265-Kerbal-Space-Program-Asteroid-Redirect-Mission-The-FAQ) there was this passage.

 **What is this Claw thing?**

The Advanced Grappling Device, or claw, is your primary means of capturing an asteroid. The Claw works very much like a docking port, however, it doesnt require a mate node to dock to. That means it can grab on to almost any object. Once grabbed on, you can even transfer fuel from the grabbed objects (provided they have any). 

Does this mean that regular docking ports become less useful? This wording implies that I can just launch a fuel tank tank with a probe on it into orbit and suck from it with this claw thingy. 














 I posted some shops to /r/photoshopbattles a few times, but I actually enjoy more cutting people/things out than think what witty should I do with it. 





























 A few weeks ago I have read an article about possible human colonies floating in Venusian atmoshere, and a question occured to me whether something like that would be possible to build in atmosphere of some Kerbol system planets?

I read on the wiki that lighter probes don't even need a parachute on Jool, so I don't think it would be completely impossible. What do you Kerbal rocket scientist think?

 I do it just as a hobby, don't get any money. 
























 Life would have been much easier.

**Edit:**

Utterly meaningless coincidence: 

Bartledanian books are 100 000 words long. According to the [Words to Pages](http://www.wordstopages.com/) converter, a book with 100 000 words written in Arial font size 12 with double spacing would have 365.3 pages. That is almost exactly the same number as number of days in a year. 









 Whoever posts best inspirational quote wins and I'll send them the key. 




 Just because it is so nice and quiet here 









 I get that you can carry 1000 books in a reader everywhere, but paper books are flexible, have "personality", last potentially a very long time and frankly, do you really need to read 15 books at a time? 




 No posts. I am not longer interested in it, so anyone else can take care of it. 


































 I know there is no point to it without mods beside satisfying feel, but i would like to ask you what do you think should be there, how big it should be and so on.

EDIT: Without mods of any kind

 I think we should get a bot which would after typing something like "BibleVerse: Part XX:XX" respond with corresponind verse from standard King James Bible.

Commenters on this sub often adress some verses, so this could be useful. I wonder whether this idea have been proposed before, if it was, i am sorry.

Same could be done for other holy books too.  




 It's because of authority of the person who said them? Or because the quotee formulated the idea so well that a quoter feel they don't need to add anything?

And why some people hate quotes so much?

 



















 I was on Minmus with Bill and Bob. On the top of a lander there was a rolling probe, so i rolled it about 1,5 km away, did some measurements and flew with Jeb to collect data (well, more slid than flew).

When i was a few tens of meters from it, i switched to probe to slightly angle it for convenience. When i wanted to switch back, there was no Jeb.

He disappeared.

I was confused at first and looked for him all over, but he simply vanished. I went to Astronaut Complex and he is listed as MIA.

What the hell?

BTW when i planted the flag i named it Jebediah's Vision after that creepypasta; coincidence much? 




 [SteamID](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197997373039)

It released yesterday, but i don't have any money. It is on sale now. I would be very grateful and make sure to pay it forward later. 




 I play on lowest setting due to my old PC, but i was thinking if i could afford to make my game a bit prettier without losing performance. 









 After almost 300 hours of playtime i found out how to rotate parts in 5 steps and how to clone. I feel stupid. I was thinking how people make Death Stars and bowling balls and lithobraking stuff and it never occured to me to google it.
If i did not watch some Manley's video i wouldn't know it... I thought i figured the game by myself. Well, i have a lot to learn yet.

Edit: And of course the rest of controls too, i forget to mention it. 




 I am browsing interwebs and what i don't see like announcement that the Octodad sequel finally came out! I am extremely happy, but i remember i ran out of my allowance for this month and will have to wait and buy it when it will be not on sale anymore.

So please, if someone could give it to me, i would be very grateful and make sure to pay it forward later.

 I am pleased. I love oatmeal. I think i am going to make myself a cup. 




 The question of money would be put aside, because people would realize the utmost importance of expanding into space, so all materials and workforce would be for "free" (people could even volunteer for working on some tasks like manufacturing parts, which would then be send to ~~World Space Center~~ Starfleet from all over the world; those who participate in programme would get all they need from governments) 


































 Note: I am a fan of 2005's Doctor Who. I am not planning on watching older series, i am quite content with the new.

I must say it is one of the best series i've seen. About a year ago i started to hear from my friends how good it is, they posted DW related things on Facebook and i am naturally quite open-minded, so i put it on my imaginary "To watch" list, but i did not rush in any way, actually, it was one of my new classmates who gave me needed push.

First episodes were feeling like it was a cheap TV production - it probably was, and i do not complain - and it got better with time. I love series which have consistent universe, and DW satisfied me in this way.

Not everyone may see it same, but i like how they put homosexuality in there every so often - i am not a homosexual or in LGBT community, but i am happy for those people, i support them (of course i like gay jokes and so on, but that is different). I also felt some atheist themes in the series, that was pleasant too. I also very like the Doctor's "no guns" policy, it's not something you can see very often today.

I sure am going to continue watching, though i call myself just a fan (don't really have urge to call myself whoovian yet; maybe this will be my backup fandom)

 There is always someone who hasn't seen something yet. 




 I flew to the Mun and collected high amount of scientific data, but i underestimated needed power to get back to Kerbin, and poor Kerbal must have EVAed (of course with data) and set himself on stable orbit. So i send first rescue - it was a probe with four solar panels, i don't know how, but i managed to position the way that no light could reach them, thus rendering probe dead. For my second try i attached two 1x6 automatic panels to it and i even managed to get rendezvous orbit - but in the wrong way! Now i am going for my third try. Wish me luck!

EDIT: Finally! That was insane, it took 4 tries before i managed to pick up poor Kerbal, and then i had to position vessel hanging on a parachute so he won't fall off his seat (another valuable lesson - always using capsules). 









 If i add an addon, will it render my vanilla profile save unusable in vanilla again, even if i don't use modded parts? 




 I have googled a bit, but i can't see nothing. 














 What is the point in rescuing Kerbals?

Have you ever collided with a piece of debris from your earlier launches?

Do you consider mods cheating? 




 I landed dozen or so manned modules on Mun, i learned to dock on orbit (i started to build a space station) and i got a few new upgrades.
