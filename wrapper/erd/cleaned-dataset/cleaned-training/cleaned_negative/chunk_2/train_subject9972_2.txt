 I added new device - mobile phone around same time 7 days ago and I still can't accept trade offers. Do I have to wait until day ends or what? Also, can you check how many days you have left until you can trade.

Thanks! :) 




 What if it's not valid/duplicate? Will it say so like in online mode? 




 As stated above, shoot with literally anything except Dead Island epidemic or ship or gun monkeys. Please. 




 Bureau XCOM, Darkness, keys, whatever, just post here 














 Since I'm staying on vacation until late August and won't have access to steam, I'm looking for someone who can purchase BTA/non BTA 2K bundle and save it for me until I get home. I am mostly looking for Bureau XCOM and maybe Darkness 2. So whoever can purchase me bta bundle and save it for me aswell as Deponia Complete Journey, I would greatly appreciate it. Write me here, and we can discuss the price asap. 

Thanks :) 




 Is there active PES 2013 community or is it better to wait for 2015 to come out? Not really a huge fan of 2014. 




 So, I'm staying on a vaication for a while where I don't have acces to internet on my PC. I have internet on mobile, and I'm wondering will my steam offline mode on PC brake if I login on steam on my mobile?

 I'm new to this game and I can't seem to understand how to attack with your troops other troops that came via sea. I'm fighting during third mission "We will endure" and it's so hard to attack ( don't know how), while in the meantime, I don't even have baracks built.

 




 As stated, please don't lowball and please for the love of God don't offer me Dead Island Epidemic. 









 Is there active community on PC now and should I get Fifa 14 now, or just wait for the Fifa 15? 

Is there overall active PC community regarding FIFA ? 




 So in a few days, I'm going on a long vaication where I won't have access to internet on my PC for a while. ( 1-2 months at the most ). 

So, regardin steam and its offline mode, how does it works, does it have any limits on how long can I use it? Is it restricted in any sort? 

And what happens with achivements and playhours?

 I've never been able to access steam market since I never bought anything from steam store/market itself.
My question is, if I buy steam card now, and activate it, will I be able to use market without any kinds of restrictions considering buying/selling on market, or will I have somekind of cooldown before I'm able to do that?

 Are there enough people to play FIFA 14 on PC, online and stuff like that? 









 I think I'm almost done with the game, and I'm packed up with potions ( full of everything ) have 300+ gold left, and I came to the point where I had to check if my difficulty didn't lower it self while I was playing. 

The game is really great, I love it so far, but I feel that it could've been more challenging. 

What do you think about it? 




 pls, I'm very confused 




 My current specs are following: 

CPU; AMD ATHLON II X4 640 @ 3.00GHz QuadCore

Memory; 8GB RAM DDR3 1333MHz "Kingston"PC10666 CL9

Harddrive; 500GB Sata

Graphic card; ATi RADEON Sapphire HD7850 1GB GDDR5

Motherboard: FOXCONN A78AX 3.0

I want to upgrade my processor ( + motherboard since this one doesn't support AM3+ ) so, what do you think I should get with this configuration with around 300$? 

I'm playing on 1920x1080.

Should I get an SSD too?

 




 What's the Length of the game with and without side-quests? 




 Is there any video to show how good this game is and why is it actually good game? 

I mean how to make someone love the game if you know what I mean. 




 CPU; AMD ATHLON II X4 640 @ 3.00GHz QuadCore

Memory; 8GB RAM DDR3 1333MHz "Kingston"PC10666 CL9

Harddrive; 500GB Sata

Graphic card; ATi RADEON Sapphire HD7850 1GB GDDR5

I'm playing on 1920x1080.

This is my currently build, and I'm afraid to buy Dayz thinking it wouldn't perform properly due to bad optimisations. 

Should this be enough to run the game without a hitch?

And I kinda want the game so leaving for a bit until they potentionally fix the optimisation is kinda not an option, since they may up the price a little bit then and stuff like that ...
