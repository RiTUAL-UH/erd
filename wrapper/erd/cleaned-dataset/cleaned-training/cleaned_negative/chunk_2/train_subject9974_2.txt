 If we were all defined by our extremists, I reckon we would be in quite a pickle. KKK members and white supremacists certainly aren't the norm in our faith, just like extremists aren't the norm in yours.

I was in Afghanistan. I have seen firsthand the difference between radicals, and everyday Muslims. I still do not understand why so many are so willing to propogate some kind of "new crusades". 




 I found conviction in my beliefs by finding conviction in His word. I have never had any experience of God. No feelings, no eerie emotions. I do believe his word because he has, by grace, enabled me to believe it.  




 Hello, Afghanistan veteran here.

I am curious to know whether you think the war/military intervention has made Iraq better or worse, from personal experience?

1. How has the country changed since Saddam's regime fell, in your personal experience?

2. How has U.S. intervention affected you personally?

3. What are your opinions about the war and the soldiers who fought it? 




 I think they are basically the same thing as Tacoma's in the U.S  









 Ah, toyota hilux's. I haven't seen one of those since Afghanistan. 




 As a Reformed Presbyterian I would answer the question by saying we do not have free will. Our will is limited in scope and ability. 

Yes, I believe in predestination. 




 Reason is not a conservative publication. 









 I am in the Army. I spend varying lengths of time away from my wife, from days at a time to over a year. Sometimes we can skype, sometimes call, we have written letters, sometimes we cannot talk for weeks at a time.  









 Maybe you missed the news breaking that our government has been actively spying on us... 









 1984 is amazing. Be prepared to realize you are living right in the middle of it. 




 Good night.. I love how they always justify it with "every other developed country has hate speech laws". If our neighbors hate liberty, so must we! 




 It puts the fragility of life into perspective. Though I am only in my twenties, the attitude of bullettproof youth is all gone. Experiences like that tend to make you grow up quickly too. I think I am more mature than many of my civilian peers because I have come to realize the things most of them think are important, are not important at all. 




  "You give them credibility when you silence yourself,"

Now that is what I am talking about. 









 *To Kill A Mockingbird* taught me what true masculinity should look like, what meekness was, and how courageous it was to stand up for lost causes. It taught me that justice is not dependent on what our peers think it is. Atticus Finch is still my role model. One day, if we have a son, my wife and I have agreed to name him Atticus. 









 I was in Afghanistan at 22. Watched a friend die up close. 

I would say that whole experience has shaped and defined me in a way not much else could. 




 Bring them a gift. Donuts or coffee.

BTW, I wish I could meet them. I am a soldier. I would love to give them a cup of coffee and tell them I recognize and respect their humanity, even if they do not respect mine.

 Adidas and Puma were started by rival brothers. Both brothers were diehard nazis. Both companies contributed to clothing the nazis. 




 I am a soldier. Yes, absolutely fulfilling. I get sent to crapholes all around the world, work retarded hours, gripe and complain about every minute of it. But I would not trade it for the world.
 




 I love MC Lars's stuff. He is a English geek who became a hip hop artist, using hip-hop to teach literature.

[Here](http://youtu.be/1ucYtOk_8Qo) is his TEDx talk entitled *The hip-hop of Shakespeare*

And [here](http://youtu.be/lR7NmXdEMCg) is one of my favorite songs by him, an adaptation of Poe's *Annabel Lee* into hip-hop.

Be forewarned, he is quirky as hell. 




 [This interview](http://youtu.be/qzKzu86Agg0) by ReasonTV with Mike Rowe on the high cost of college.


And [this poem by Jesse Parent](http://youtu.be/KcIwZ1Dth0c) entitled "To The Boys Who May One Day Date My Daughter" 




 [*FRESH*](http://www.freshthemovie.com) really made me think about where my food is coming from. As a result, I try to be more conscious about how my food was made. 

Plus it introduced me to Joel Salatin and his ideas, who is now one of my heroes. 




 There really is not a quick way to earn money. The best bet is to pick up an extra job and pay it off chunk by chunk. It may take awhile, but it is the only stable solution. 




 And the statists call our economics "magical". 









 Nobody at your unit can help you. You have to talk to your branch manager.  




 They pay the service provider to air their ads because that exposes their product to a large group of consumers.

Paying the consumers directly to watch an ad to convince them to buy the product is an incredibly roundabout and expensive way of doing it. It would cost a huge sum of money to reach the amount of people just one ad on a regular television program reaches.  




 Some of it has to do with the fact that places like Thailand have extremely unregulated sex workers. If you were looking for things that were frowned upon by developed society (age) you would obviously go somewhere where there is not a ton of regulation of that market. 




 Some denominations continued using wine, and the producers of sacramental wine were able to get exemptions.

Other denominations who were at the head of the prohibitionist movement switched to using grape juice. One of the fellows who started Welch's grape juice company was a vehement advocate for teetotaling, and tried to advocate for grape juice being used at the communion table. 

That divide still exists today. Many of the more fundamentalist Christian denominations who advocate teetotalism use grape juice instead of wine at the Table. 




 Tom Cruise or Steve Carell. Both classy and hilarious guys. 

I hate late night shows like Letterman, but anytime either of those gentlemen are guests I have to tune in. 




 Left Hand Brewing's Nitro Milk Stout. 




 There is nothing wrong with this. Joining the military is an act of voluntary association. You agree to their rules. 

I agree with ending the drug war, but if an employer includes restricting drug use in an employment contract, and you agree to that contract, you are held to that contract. 




 Awesome! Our library staff here on Fort Drum is incredible. 




 That is the point of stand up comedy. If they got up there and gave accurate, totally unexaggerated representations of the people in their lives, it would not be funny at all. So they exaggerate, make stereotypes, and *make jokes*. 




 Not a librarian, but I just wanted to say I have a tremendous amount of respect for y'all. No matter where I have lived (literally all over as a military servicemember) the local library has always welcomed me with open arms. I think data and information management is such a ncessity in a developed society. Folks do not know how important y'all are.


So thank you! 




 With steak.

Because I am a man. 




 Because you are a gigolo who takes working lunches? 




 Ah, I see. Is it British slang? 




 Fine. I joined the Army. I am originally from South Alabama, they moved me to Northern New York. I have learned to like it though. Been here three years, became very active in the community, have friends, still miss boiled peanuts. 




 Tobacco pipe smoking. 




 Could you explain what a sarnie is? 




 **OP**

1. I am in the Army. I work in a motorpool helping maintain trucks. 

2. I bring an old green stanley lunchbox with me to work everyday. It is usually filled with a bar of lava soap, moonpies or little debbie cakes, two sandwiches (usually bologna or salami on white bread), chips or a small green thermos of soup, and a can of coca-cola. I also bring a gallon jug of sweet tea that I consume throughout the work day and whatever book I am currently reading.  I get about an hour lunch break. I scrub my hands, sit down in my office, and eat at a back desk, taking my time.

3. I usually use my lunchbreak to either listen to a podcast (either *This American Life*, *How Stuff Works*, or *Planet Money*), or reading a bit of whatever book I am currently working on. After my break I am usually energized to finish the rest of the day (which tends to be long). 




 1. What is your vocation?

2. Describe a typical workday lunch ritual for you.

3. Do you use your lunch break for anything other than quickly scarfing down substinence? 




 She paints, makes crafts, volunteers at our local USO, volunteers for the military family readiness group, and teaches classes to new Army wives. 




 A Maglite. 

A large bag of marshmallows.

 Because I do not go to parties. And if I did, they would not be parties with dancing. They would probably be scrabble parties. Or maybe jeapordy parties. Perhaps I would even get crazy and attend one of my book club's parties. But never *ever* a dancing party. 




 Does humanity have a good track record when it comes to reacting peacefully to people who are different than them? 




 It depends on how quickly the state were dismantled. 

The first step is to stop forcing people to pay into Social Security in the first place. 














 Samwise sounded more like Spock. 




 You listed many pros, but I think you forgot a con.

There is the possibility you would see Hillary naked one day. Think about that for a minute.

 Most religious people have absolutely no problem talking about sex.

 Firefly. 




 I am not with it at all. I don't really like pop culture, so I just kind of ignore it. 




 Not exactly. Ukraine is a totally seperate country. Ukraine was a part of the USSR, but when the USSR dissolved Ukraine won independence.

Now Crimea, which was a small state within Ukraine, has voted to leave Ukraine and annex to Russia. Ukraine is still a totally seperate nation though. 




 Yeah, I still have no clue either. It seems totally bogus to me, whatever it was. 




 Welding. If you get certified, you can bring in some serious side hustle.  




 Nothing unbelievably. All of my skills are quite believable.

 




 Are you asking for Australians to comment on their favorite American foods, or are you an Australian who wishes for Americans to comment on their favorite American foods? 




 Afghanistan has to be on the list. 

I was there. The mountains are breathtaking. They have a rich and multifaceted culture that has been hijacked by religious extremism. Their economy, liberty, human rights etc are awful. 




 Basically I am asking how important you think it is to work a vocation that is totally your dream, as opposed to learning a skill you love some parts of and dislike other parts of. 

Weigh in, how do you approach the idea of vocational fulfillment? 




 I just finished the episode, and I was floored by how sucked into this stuff people get.. Normal people leaving their jobs for a get rich scheme.. I dunno, it really surprised me. 




 What are some examples of market economies in which individuals were close to totally free markets, and those markets worked?

I am just looking for tangible examples of laissez faire working. Can y'all help? 




 There is not one value. Mature and responsible manhood is a combination of various attributes. 




 My workshop. I have a minifridge stocked with craft beer. The walls are decorated with various tin signs, beer neons, gun and ammuniton ads. My tools are laid around, but not in a disorganized way. Unfinished projects, currently a bookshelf, lie on the other half. I have a lived in recliner I picked up from a garage sale over by the minifridge.  




 Bootcamp will be the easiest part of your military career. Do not be an individual. Blend in, be quiet, do not stand out and you will be fine.

Remember, when you get to your first unit, nobody will give a shit how good you were in boot camp. So just get through it.  




 Probably a pavlovian effect created by years of advertising.

In other words, you have been programmed to react that way by years of watching someone drink coke on televison and making that sound. 

If you are unfamiliar with classical conditioning [this Wikipedia article](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning) explains it. 




 It is hard to explain. Each department has a lot of independence. They are not exactly in the same chain of command. More like several cooperating entities with their own chains of command. 




 Kind of. They have different roles. If a crime happens within the city, and is confined to the city, it is usually the local PD who takes care of it. If it is a county wide thing, a crime involving several cities, or outside of city limits, the Sheriff will usually handle it. If it js a statewide thing, or something on state land, the troopers get it. 

That being said, there is a ton of cooperation between departments. There is also conflict. Sometimes Sheriff's and Deputies overstep their bounds in city limits, and vice versa. It is a more organic relationship.  




 Sheriff's Dept. is the *county* police forcr, local PD's are the *city's* police force, and State Troopers are the *state's* police force.
 




 What if there were a travel show in which the host visited notable libraries around the world? The Vatican Library,The Library of Congress, The Admont Library etc. There could even be episodes where famous authors take the host to their favorite libraries. Along the way the host could comment on notable rare books, library histories, ways in which libraries have contributed to their local communities, and other things. 

I mean c'mon people, we have a travel show called *Booze Traveller*, but we cannot make a good travel show about books? 




 *Das Kapital* is on my reading list, I have been a little intimidated by it though, it is quite the beast. 




 Well they would if they were communists. But they are not. 


China is communist in the same way the U.S. is capitalist, i.e. not at all. Do you believe the U.S. is an actual capitalist country? No. We are a mixed economy. We are a hybrid of semi-free markets and government intervention. China, N. Korea etc are the same way. They started out totally communist. Now they are hybrid states, centralized totalitarian authority states mixed with some form of limited market economy. 




 This makes literally zero sense. Marx and Engels's *Communist Manifesto* is the founding document of Communism. 




 Dry ice. Nitrogen cooling. Both would cool your items very quickly. 




 Yes I am aware. But obviously other nations have nuclear weapons. If we were a stateless society, how could we protect ourselves from other nations with nuclear weapons. 




 I am a pretty staunch libertarian, strong advocate for decentralization, and near ancap. I have a few reservations though. Perhaps y'all could help me.

1. What happens to nukes in Ancapistan? Obviously worldwide anarchism is not going to happen overnight, so even if the U.S. becomes a voluntary society, Russia, China etc will still have powerful weapons, and might seek to take advantage of what they see as a vulnerable situation. How do we as a society of individuals protect ourselves against these weapons? Also, what happens to the nukes the U.S government owns once it disbands?

2. Along those lines, how does a voluntary society protect itself from a sadistic individual obtaining a WMD? Say someone gets the money and ability to buy a powerful weapon. How do we stop him from killing thousands?

3. If the U.S. government disbanded, do you not see it as likely that another nation would try to use coercive force to take over? How could we possibly arm ourselves well enough to prevent that without a professional military.


These are just a few of my reservations. I definitely think liberty wins, and that ancap ideals can be implemented over a small scale, but I have a really hard time seeing it as a large scale option... 




 Gerbils, hamsters, ferrets, guinea pigs... all domesticated rodents. 




 I agree with what you are saying. Leftist descriptors are mostly slurs nowadays. Some libertarians do not understand the ideas behind leftist philosophy. This coming from a diehard capitalist.  




 I obviously disagree with them on fundamental issues, but the ignorance of many Americans about Socialism and Communism really bugs me. 


 









 Can someone recommend some libertarian debate videos? Anything liberty-related. 









 Can someone give me an easy explanation of the differences between socialist anarchism and anarcho-syndicalism? 




 Hey y'all. 

I am an active duty soldier nearing the end of my enlistment. I am seriously considering the railroad as a post-military career. Maybe y'all can help me with some questions.

1. I am currently a shop supply specialist. I oversee the order of parts for the motorpool, schedule services, keep track of inventory etc. A lot of supply and maintenance management. How do these skills translate into railroading?

2. Are the hours as bad as I hear? Being in the military has gotten me used to long hours, being away from my family, but I have heard many horror stories about railroading. 

3. How are the benefits? 
 




 I know y'all probably get a lot of these posts. I am sorry! 

I am interested in podcasts about 

Libertarianism

Art and literature

History

Social issues

Travel

Science fiction and fantasy


  




 As the title says I am an avowed laissez faire capitalist libertarian looking to engage some socialists respectfully. I have some honest questions, I am not trying to argue or pick a fight, just looking for a civil conversation.

1. What do you think the biggest misconceptions are about socialism?

2. What is your opinion as a full socialist about mixed economies (like the U.S) where the market is neither totally free or totally socialist?

3. Do you see any difference between laissez faire capitalism and crony capitalism?

4. What books or media would you recommend to me so I can honestly understand the socialist perspective?

5. What would change in the U.S if it became a fully socialist country?

6. What things do people think would change in the U.S. if it were a socialist country, but would actually remain the same. 


Sorry to lump my questions all together, I did not know of a better way. 

Thanks! 




 1. How long have you been a Wobbly/how did you become a Wobbly?

2. What has the IWW done to improve your life?

3. How do IWW members view other consolodated unions? It seems there are many who want "one big union" but they are all fragmented.

4. How has the IWW changed to fit modern workers needs in your opinion?

5. Do you think the IWW is on the decline? 




 **My 5 Questions:**

1. How long have you been a Wobbly/how did you become a Wobbly?

 I am super obsessed with wanting to try [this](http://buy.rogue.com/rogue-sriracha-hot-stout-beer/). Has anyone here tried it? What is it like? 




 I get the basic idea, I know what Socialism is about, and I know that "libertarian" originally refered to socialists. I still don't get it.

1. Is libertarian socialism any different than regular socialism? How?

2. What the heck is anarcho-socialism about? Isn't the state a fundamental piece in the socialist theory?


Any other info would be great. 









 Hey y'all. I am going to be making a venison roast as the centerpiece for Christmas dinner this year. I am currently thinking about marinating it in red wine and black pepper then roasting it, but I thought I would ask Reddit for tips. Should I go in a different direction? 




 Do you see yourselves as counterculture or antiestablishment in realms of your life other than politics? 









 How much of an effect did the Treaty of Versailles have on the rise of Hitler? If the Treaty were more fair to Germany would the Nazi Party have still been able to take control? 









 Anything related to the labor movement, labor strikes, unionization etc. Books on these topics are pretty hard to find... 




 Worka that deal with political campaigns, political intrigue, fiction geared around politicians etc.  




 Can y'all recommend good fiction set during the Bolshevik Revolution/rise of Soviet Empire? 




 Basically self-explanatory. How much does readership factor into dateability for you? 




 I am looking to broaden my horizons. Please recommend rap/hip-hop for me? 

Something educated. Proper wordsmiths speaking about social issues/important issues. 

Nothing about partying, drugs, sex, etc. None of those things interest me.

I am not tryong to come off abrasive, I am genuinely looking to expand my horizons, but I need substance. 




 If you were to start dating a man who had PTSD
How soon should he tell you? It becomes a core part of the victim's identity.
How big of a factor would PTSD be when deciding whether to continue dating that person?
Do you personally feel that you would be able to date someone you knew from the beginning had PTSD?
There are no wrong answers, I am just curious as to opinions on this issue. Again, this is geared to be about someone you just recently started seeing/barely know yet.

 Do any of y'all keep a regular journal? If so, what kind? 




 I am an Anglican leaning Presbyterian who wants to implement a greater Advent awareness in my familiy's devotions. We are going to start using the BCP lectionary and Collects. What other things can we implement to deepen our Advent experience? 




 Which beer do you think goes well with Christmas? It does not have to be a seasonal beer necessarily, but any beer that tastes Christmasy to you.

For me it is actually Ommegang Witte. I know many see it as a refreshing summer beer (which it can be) but the spices and fruity overtones fit the holidays for me. 




 I am really into technical artwork, mechanical blueprints and cutaway art of machinery. Is there anywhere on the web I can gorge on scifi pics of imagined machines? 














 I think most of us feel the Army has made our lives better in some way. I am curious what life skills y'all would say the Army/deployment have given you? What specific ways have the Army made you a better person? 




 Putting together a playlist for a long ride, and I am curious what are some of y'alls favorite road trip songs? 




 For example, parents who leave children in hot cars, feeding kids horrible food and contributing to major health problems etc.

If so, is there a solution? 




 Honestly I was disappointed.. It was not content. I loved the idea, background, and setting. I think it was style. It was too short, too quick.. I barely had interaction with the setting, characters, or background. The "hook" was done poorly I thought. Things like that have to be done with subtlety, especially in short stories. It needed more buildup, more subtle shifting towards the two possible outside worlds..


**TL;DR** - Great idea, great setting, would have been better reworked as a novel with more time and depth. Barely three stars. 




 New guy here trying to get into GP. Please inform me?

Also, where does AMA Road racing and flat track racing fit into the picture? Is the AMA Road racing series completely unrelated to GP?  




 Does anyone know how I can find detailed technical manuals/drawings of various models of bikes? Is there a consolidated resource like this? 




 Just curious if any of y'all keep a journal for tobacco? I have been smoking pipes for a few years now, and I love trying new blends. I usually annotate the characteristics of new things I try, along with what kind of pipe I used, if I paired it with a beer or bourbon etc..

If you do keep a pipe/tobacco journal what layout do you use? 




 Can y'all give me some suggestions? I love vintage sound, I love pedal steel and old school sound engineering. I also like some more cowpunkish stuff. 

I love Nikki Lane, Justin Townes Earle, Willie Nelson, Haggard, Hank III's traditional stuff, and Jamey Johnson among others. 









 I am curious to learn more about liberty mindfulness in the Democratic Party.

1. Who were some liberty minded Democrats of the past?

2. Are there any liberty minded Democrats today?

3. What were some historic stands that Democrats took for liberty? 




 I am in a rented apartment, and rather than pay the exorbitant repair fee to the landlord, I figured I would just spackle it up and paint it myself. The issue is that my walls have textured paint, something like orange peel, and I do not know how to replicate the texture. Can someone offer advice? The scratches are not huge, and I just need to blend them in to the rest of the wall. 




 1. What is the general opinion amongst Marxists regarding Lenin?

2. Were the RSFSR and subsequent USSR successful communist systems? Are they good examples of what most modern day communists would like to see Capitalist countries imitate? 




 Do communist refute self ownership? How do communists view the relationship between an individual and his own self? 




 1. Did the TechnoCore remind anyone else of Asimov's MultiVac?

2. Did anyone else think Brawne Lamia came off sounding annoyingky similar to a 50's noir pulp-fiction detective character?

All in all it was a great book. 




 This sub is full of recommendations for *The Name of The Wind*. It's been on my TR list for a long time, but after hearing all the hype I moved it to the top of my list. I was very disappointed. Kvothe was really unbelievable for me. He was just too flawless. The magic system seemed heavily borrowed from Earth sea. I didn't hate it, I'm actually really interested to read the new book about Auri (the underthing was my favorite part) but the book only got three stars from me. 




 What are some good SF F websites to browse? I'm interested in SF F news, commentary, artwork, etc anything SF F related really.

What are the best places to check out?
