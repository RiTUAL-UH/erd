 It's a tragedy how Christian Fundamentalist extremists have managed to sully the phrase "Christian" in barely more than a generation.

"Christian" used to be a noble and honorable appellation, and in its traditional definition remains so.

However, given all of the scandals, scams, hucksterism, fraud, and extremist right-wing political activism we've seen among Evangelical Protestants in the last 30 or so years, "Christian" has picked up very negative connotations such as to imply ignorance, smug self-delusion, and false righteousness.

It should never have been this way, but there was too much money and power to be had. 


 




 The most foolish and self-destructive move the American Catholic Church ever made was to ally with frothing Fundamentalist Evangelicals on "Culture War" issues.

It's cost the Church so much in the credibility department (especially among Catholics) that I wonder if the damage can ever be undone.

 "right-to-rise society"

I wouldn't be surprised if this becomes a new Republican catch phrase. I see Rove's hand here.

Remember how Rove sold GWB as a "reformer with results" and a "compassionate conservative"?

"Right-to-rise" is both alliterative and has a slight tinge of dog-whistle. 




 Hopefully this will hasten the decline of social conservatism. 




  I was interested in Rand, but my inbox got filled with requests for money.

Ever notice how Ron and Rand Paul ***constantly beg*** for that "worthless fiat currency" they so deride?

 




  I'm more of a Democrat than anything

Yep. Because Democrats always run around snarking about "SJWs" and whining about "feminists."

Everyone believes you.

 




 The LIBERTY!^TM Brigades are here! 




 If you want a similar deal, I'm sure Ron would still be willing to take your "worthless fiat currency" in exchange for it, just like he's done for all his true believers for decades.

You act in your own "informed, rational self-interest," right? Give Paul a call! I'm sure he'll be willing to work with you. He might even throw in a racist newsletter for your troubles!





 




 Ron Paul has been "consistent" in courting, then scamming money from White Nationalists and Neo-Confederates for decades (if that's what you mean by "consistent.")

This story was just pulled by the Mods from the /r/politics "New" queue as "Not US Politics." Decide for yourself if their characterization is accurate: the users of /r/politics aren't able to.

Here's the full text of the article:

In a 2010 radio interview, Frazier Glenn Miller, the man suspected of killing three people Sunday at a Jewish community center and a Jewish retirement center in Kansas, said he was interested in the tea party, voiced support for then-Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, and spoke approvingly of Ron Paul, the Texas Republican congressman and presidential candidate. In late April 2010, Miller, a former Ku Klux Klan Grand Dragon, was a guest on The David Pakman Show, a nationally syndicated left-of-center radio and television program. At the time, Miller was running for US Senate as an independent in his home state of Missouri with the slogan "It's the Jews, Stupid," and Pakman pressed Miller on his extreme views.

During the interview, Miller was unabashed about his anti-Semitic positions. When asked whether he thought the United States would be better off if Hitler had succeeded, Miller responded, "Absolutely, the whole world wouldHitler would have created a paradise on Earth, particularly for white people. But he would have been fair to other people as well." He added, "Germans are blamed collectively because of the alleged so-called Holocaust."

Not surprisingly, Miller denigrated most American politicians, but cited one positively: "If I had my way [all US senators] would be in jail right now for treason, if not hung from a sturdy oak treeRon Paul is the only independent politician, representative in Washington." He also spoke highly of another conservative: "Patrick Buchanan, he's a great man, he's a great historian, he's one of the very few journalists who has the courage to speak out against Jewish domination in the country." Miller called Howard Stern "a Jew liar." When asked whether he supported the tea party, Miller replied, "The school's still out on them. They're a new movement. I'm watching them closely. I suspect, however, they'll be infiltrated by the Jews and therefore led into defeat."

During the interview, Pakman asked Miller whom he would "elect, deport, and waterboard"given the choices of President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, and former Fed chair Alan Greenspan. Miller answered, "I like Obama more than the other two, by far." He chose to elect Obama, deport Greenspan, and waterboard Biden. Miller said, "I have a great deal of admiration [for] Louis Farrakhan," and he called Ahmadinejad "a great man" because he "has guts and he tells the truth about the Jews."

"I'm a convicted felon and I'm proud of it," Miller boasted, noting that he "was convicted of declaring war on the federal government and possession of illegal weapons." He added that Jews "were responsible for my conviction that prompted me to go underground and declare warMorris Dees mainly, he's a Jew that runs the Southern Poverty Law Center." (The SPLC monitors hate groups.)

In November 2013, Pakman had an exchange of emails with Miller in which Miller noted that he was "close friends" with Craig Cobb, a white supremacist who had attempted to form an all-white town in Leith, North Dakota. According to Miller, the two had worked together "on several White Nationalist projects, including the Aryan Alternative newspaper." Referring to the recent news that a DNA test indicated that Cobb had African ancestry, Miller told Pakman, "I can't believe a man as intelligent as you, actually believes Craig Cobb is an octoroon. Surely, you know it's just another jewsmedia fraud."

 I'm noticed that some of  the news sources the Censorship Mods arbitrarily banned (oops, *sorry,* "filtered") have been getting through.

Did the Admins have to have a little talk with that petulant crew of self-appointed authoritarian censors over at r/politics?

What say you, our dear Censorship Mods? Did those "Community Outreach" purges of yours finally catch up with you? 




 This comment was deleted on at least one other subreddit. Hopefully this redacted version will pass muster. Please give it you consideration, and add your thoughts in the comments.
______________________


In response to another redditor's query: **"What are some trends on reddit that should die?"**

Censorship.

In some reedits, censorship of legitimate news sources, users, and user comments based on the whim of rogue, self-appointed Moderators is now the norm, not the rare exception.

Yes, /u/[REDACTED] , /u/[REDACTED] , /u/[REDACTED]r , /u/[REDACTED] , and /u/[REDACTED](among others,) you Censorship Mods over at /r/[REDACTED] ban users and sources at individual whim. This has been well documented and will only become a larger issue until the Admins of reddit deal with the censorship dictates you Neo-Mods have forced upon the largest political message board on the Internet.

You deem sources "unacceptable" and they are pulled before they even hit the /r/[REDACTED]/new newsfeed.

As a redditor, I don't need some vigilante Mods deciding what is and what is not acceptable to their whim and censoring content "for our own Good." There are tens of millions of redditors, and we don't need authoritarian control over the means of our communication. We can decide for ourselves, thank you very much.

Salon is banned on /r/[REDACTED]. Wonkette is also banned. For a brief time, until reddit outrage grew too large to ignore and the Censorship Mods were forced to backtrack, Mother Jones was banned. (Mother Jones is the media outfit that broke the "Mitt Romney 47%" story, the biggest political story of 2012.) But the Censorship Mods were forced to back down when it blew up in their faces; they were made to undo their unjustified and partisan ban of Mother Jones. Other of their arbitrary bans remain in place to this day.

What sources are you not able to see, fellow reddit users, because the /r/[REDACTED] Neo-Mods have decided that they know better than you do what is and what is not news and/or politics? (Hint: more than you think.)

Reddit exists because of the free flow of information. When self-appointed guardians of what is valid and what is not seize control to impose their spiteful will by force upon an unwilling community, they are violating the very premise of reddit. This is why Admin intervention is needed: this Censorship train needs to be stopped in its tracks before it becomes a trend among other would-be authoritarian Mods.

The "Digg Patriots" destroyed digg; we cannot stand by as "Reddit Patriots" force the same fate on Reddit.

Don't let the Censorship Mods win. 





















































































































































 He said something about "primate nocturnal" or something and declared it was his natural right to devirginize my new wife.

I know he's right, because he is richer and better and smarter than me. But does anyone know what he's talking about?

This is a disappointing start to our marriage. I can't make ice in the Liberty trailer, so the Liberty champagne I had specially chilled for our honeymoon night went warm while we used the ice to keep her swelling and bruising down.

She just arrived here from abroad last week. I hope this incident doesn't skew her perspective on LibertyWorld, where the natural rights of Propertarians reign supreme, and they harvest our Flowers of Freedom at will. 









 Please share your stories. 



















 And why do they seem so happy to do so, even as they continue to lose ground every year? Is the American Right's "flag-and-eagle-porn" really that effective?

Any ideas? 



















 When did you first realize that Ron Paul was not in fact "a Champion of the Constitution" but nothing more than a Neo-Confederate grifter who exploits the paranoid fears of White Supremacists?

Did you fall for the "Hey, he's 'Grandpa Peace 'n Pot!'" rebranding that started online in the mid-2000s to cover up Ron Paul's past and his decades-long associations with the *Turner Diaries* crowd?

How long did it take you to get out of the Cult of Paul? Are people you know still in?

Please share your personal stories.  



















 That's right  it's [Ron Paul!](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7018/6560359999_b98a55fc71.jpg)

 Why or why not? 






















































 I dont know what the future holds for the Republican Party.

The Republicans, desperate to win at all costs, deliberately targeted both the malignantly ignorant, the dangerously paranoid, and all combinations thereof. This segment remains prized for both their malleability and their susceptibility to flag-and-eagle porn. Single issue voters, who will often vote in direct opposition to their own interests for the sake of litmus test issues, are really all the Republicans have left.

Beginning with President Nixon continuing right up until today, the Republican apparatus has catered ever more to these loons to secure victory. As a result, the paranoid and proudly ignorant now make up the largest segment of the Republican coalition, and traditional Eisenhower/Rockefeller Republicans are not only excoriated as "RINOs," they're viewed as prize game.

The Party now finds itself in trouble: it can no longer win national elections due to this self-cultivated demographic albatross, yet they now have no chance of winning without those voters. It's not merely a matter of their individual votes: these are the activists who man Republican phone banks, donate money, walk the precincts, and hand out lawn signs.

There really is no place for a sensible American conservative to seek shelter these days. The Libertarians are even more tied to the extremist American Right and its bizarre "black helicopter" conspiracy fantasies than the Republicans are, so there is really no refuge for a sane Republican moderate.
