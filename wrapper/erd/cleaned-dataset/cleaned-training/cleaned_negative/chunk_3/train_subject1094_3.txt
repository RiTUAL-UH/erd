Thanks for the heads up dude!

 A fascinating look into the world of escorts. There is a documentary about Madame Claude but it's in French. Couldn't find the English version.

http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xirw9v_les-meres-maquerelles-madame-claude-2_news 




 "During a meeting in Denmark in March, the FBI had Siggi sign over eight hard drives containing his WikiLeaks files. When Siggi asked them about Sabu, the agents just smiled and gave him $5,000 to cover his cost of living, then sent him on his way. He never heard from them again."

Secrets that I am sure a hostile spy agency/government would have bought for millions sold for a mere 5k. How pathetic...

 From my understanding of the article, gun violence in PG-13 movies has more than tripled since 1985 and that the increasing presence of guns in popular movies can raise the "weapons effect" on both individuals and society.

 I agree with you. Some companies are even worse than Apple, if not much worse. Nevertheless, I personally think its a quite interesting insight on the people involved in making our expensive gadgets, whether its Apple or another company.

 From the article The Internal Revenue Service is responsible for collecting this penalty from individuals who indicate on their annual tax filings that they have not purchased coverage. The agency can take the penalty out of a filers refund, but beyond that, its ability to recoup those dollars is extremely limited. The IRS cannot, for example, send agents to peoples homes or put liens on their houses. In the health-care law, Congress specifically curtailed the ability to enforce this penalty, giving the IRS fewer ways to collect it than there are for other tax fines. 




 Thank you, canteloupy. That is quite appalling. I find it very demeaning to women living under such conditions.

 While I agree with you that the treatment of women and LGBT in Islamic countries is beyond horrible. The practice is unfortunately not limited to Muslim countries - we still have these issues in other religions and other western countries.

Also, wearing the Burqa is something that predates all three main religions (Judaism, Christianity and Islam): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purdah

I would also like to see these "billboards that are sometimes used to slut shame women" - I am curios as I have never heard or seen such billboards.

 Well, the NSA is worlds largest single employer of mathematicians. So, I don't think it's that very hard for them to find the stuff they're looking for. I presume the bulk of the data and their ability to hack literally anything is astounding.

 For the sake of clarity (and following the rules of /r/worldnews) BBC slightly changed the title from the one submitted in this story. Though it still has the original title "French outrage over US spying claims" on their frontpage: http://i.imgur.com/Vi4z4vR.jpg?1  




 RIP brothers. Blue skies, black death. 




 Thank you, nallen. However, there is definitely something wrong. Reading the comments more than a few users are complaining that the link is not working for them. Would appreciate if you guys can verify it and remove the story if it is indeed broken. Its quite a terrible UX clicking on broken links. 




 That's weird. It's working fine for me. Sorry about that. 




 There was a study recently published in PNAS titled "Brief meditation training induces smoking reduction" (free) http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1311887110 - sounds quite promising. 

From the article: "Among smokers, 2 wk of meditation training (5 h in total) produced a significant reduction in smoking of 60%; no reduction was found in the relaxation control."

 Hey dude - (sent a message but not sure if it went through)

The title and the quote in the story is copy/pasted letter by letter from the story itself.

On a side note, I never edit titles on this subreddit or any other subreddit. I strongly believe its misleading.

Have a great weekend!

 The data roaming rip-off is blatant and sometimes quite brutal. How can a megabyte of data be so expensive when you're in a neighboring EU country?

 I can't find a statistic/confirmed number on this but from Wikipedia regarding his first spell at the blues 

 In terms of spending, Mourinho carried on where his predecessor Claudio Ranieri left off, as, bankrolled by Roman Abramovich, he spent in excess of 70 million in transfer fees on players

 Here is Reagan's response: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VA4W1wDMAk and in-depth details from Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Air_Lines_Flight_007 




 Policymakers need to wake up and realize that software patents have inhibited innovation. It's nearly impossible today to build a piece of software that doesn't at least violate a handful of software patents, if not more. For the sake of innovation this dysfunctional patent system needs to be abolished. 




 I hope Hollande listens to the French public. He should recall his country's previous experience in relation to France's involvement in Syria post WWII. Which has played a major role in the current Syrian civil war: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Mandate_for_Syria_and_Lebanon#States_created_during_the_French_Mandate 




 This is really what you call democracy in action. It is a victory for the British public and a lesson for other nations to learn from. 

I think many of us in the west have had enough of getting involved in other nations civil wars without a real clear idea of what we're getting our soldiers into. Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya are all witness to this. 




 That is exactly what I was just reading "UK house prices rise at brisk pace, says Nationwide" http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23886149 




 Democracy and common sense prevail. Even though his position is to go to war, I praise Mr. Cameron for bringing this to a vote. And to the UK members of parliament who listened to the view of their people. It's terrible what is happening in Syria but history has proven that dropping more bombs won't bring a war to an end, it might just do the opposite by inflaming the whole of the Middle East.
