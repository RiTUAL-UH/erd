 Nope. It's not an action movie. 




 1. -
2. True Romance
3. The Raid 2 




 V for Vendetta and The Dark Knight Returns. I'd just love to see a really liberal Alan Moore character clash with Frank Miller's fascist Batman. 




 You're a mutie, Harry. 




 I felt just a lovely Spielbergian vibe that I dug so much. I really think it's one of the stronger movies. 




 And its sequel. 




 What's that in? 




 Firstly, Age of Ultron had nothing to do with the comic and the other three aren't even out yet. Secondly, I said credited, not named after. As in the actual credits say "Based on Iron Man: Extremis" or something. 




 No, in the credits for both Days of Future Past and The Wolverine, they say "Based on Days of Future Past by Chris Claremont and John Byrne" and "Based on Wolverine by Chris Claremont and Frank Miller". They'll likely do this again for Apocalypse and Fantastic Four. 




 I hope most sequels are team up movies. Wouldn't it be great to see Doctor Strange have a small role in Spider-Man 2? 




 I dislike most of the final battles in the movies. I feel **most** of them don't hold much emotional weight.

Exceptions are probably Age of Ultron, The Winter Soldier and (maybe) Guardians of the Galaxy. Iron Man is the worst, Stane turns from someone truly menacing to a cartoon villain. 




 I know the franchise is predominantly for children, but the current IDW Transformers comics are the shit. 




 Nah. He likes Luke Cage, Spider-Woman and Daredevil. Probably because they overlap with other genres better.  




 Tim Sale and Alex Maleev both have drawb a great Daredevil 




 Didn't she fail to keep that up? 




 The Fast and the Fury Road would be pretty badass.  




 I said I didn't like one aspect of Guardians of the Galaxy, a day later I was on -30 and got alerts asking whether or not I had a healthy relationship with my mother. I don't think that's acceptable. 




 I don't know how common this is, but I used to think Carlito's Way was directed by Scorsese.  




 I would like to see you the proposed book club idea come to fruition. 




 Not dark, but Interstellar involves time warping and is quite serious.  




 Not the best writing, but Natalie Portman in the Thor films. She just looks like she doesn't care. 




 At least TV is getting some variety. This Autumn we'll have Preacher, two Walking Dead shows, iZombie, Constaintine, Sex Criminals and a few more shows are coming down the line by Matt Fraction and Kelly Sue DeComick. This is probably a better place for comic adaptations due to their serialised nature.

Films for We3, Y: The Last Man and Wytches have been announced, but I doubt much will happen with them. :( 




 Beyond what? 




 I think you mean Superhero fatigue. People don't get "book fatigued". Would you really object if every comic book movie is A History of Violence or V For Vendetta tier and came out every three-four months? 




 This becomes so clear on the rewatch of Season 4 in particular.  




 I've got to remember that one. 




 The many studied at the school of Grant Morrison and came out with all the wrong lessons. It's like he heard what Morrison had to say and ventured in the opposite direction. M 




 Bendis is at his best when he's given complete freedom. No consequences and very little continuity let his dialogue and plotting shine. When he's leading events or restricted by what has been happening in other books over the years, his writing is less interesting.

Millar on the other hand needs restrictions. Give him structure and focus and he can come up with a masterpiece such as Superman: Red Son, but sometimes he gets wrapped up in ultraviolence and rape when it feels like toning it down would really help the story. I feel that's what they're doing with his film adaptations - they filter out a lot of his crap, but that's really what his editors should be doing. 




 Lots of Mark Millar and Bendis there I must note. TBH, those big battles tend to take away from the personality and meaning from the comic. Look at House of M, which is a surprisingly poignant and touching event, but it just descends into a series of splash pages towards the end. 




 Thrills. 




 Mind if I use this? 




 Starlin bringing his grandiose style to the big screen would be great. IMO he also writes the definitive Batman. 




 No-one better than Vaughan' for a Runaways movie. He created and perfected the characters.

Which other comic writers are experienced with TV and Film? i can think of Bendis, JMS and (maybe) Gaiman. 




 How is Fight Club 2? I was gonna pick it up in trade.  




 For me, it'd be Jason Aaron on Black Panther or Bendis on Spider-Man.

Aaron is used to writing tough badasses and his brief run on the Black Panther comics proved that. In three issues, he gave an in-depth understanding of both Wakandan and Skrull cultures and some truly epic battles. I'm sure he'd be able to replicate that for the big screen.

As for Bendis on Spider-Man, has any writer had such a definitive run on a character that they didn't create? (Maybe Frank Miller) He added so much to the mythos in his retelling and his stylised dialogue is perfect for film. With his inclusion in the film, he could bring along his cast of characters from Ultimate Spider-Man - who doesn't want to see a live-action Kong or Ganke (can you do Ganke without Miles?). 









 I love Truth: Red, White and Black. A really great read. If were introducing Bradley, it means that we're not too far away from Patriot and the Young Avengers.  




 You seem to be misunderstanding Rotten Tomatoes - it is only a gage of what percentage of critics liked it, not how good it is. That would be for a site like Metacritic (where it sits at a very healthy 66%). Most critics who liked it gave it a very positive review, but some struggled to overlook the flaws. Take a movie like Star Trek (2009) - it's a very enjoyable movie that most people liked (hence the 92%), but nobody who liked both it and The Wolf of Wall Street (77%) would argue it's a better movie. It's really just a way of figuring out the odds of you liking a movie and collecting the scores in one place and don't forget that 74% is still a very good score. I think, if you're looking for a place to gage how good a movie is, look towards IMDb. Although it is skewed towards films enjoyed by a teenaged and early twenties demographic, it is a better measure of how good a movie is overall as that's what it is trying to achieve, unlike Rotten Tomatoes. On IMDb, Age of Ultron has an 8.1, putting it in the top 400 movies.

**TL;DR** RT isn't for measuring how good a movie is and most critics liked it - a lot.  




 Is Groot still an alien monarch in the films? 




 This just doesn't make sense to me. I've been wanting to read Punisher MAX for ages, but the TPBs are so expensive.  




 This just doesn't make sense to me. I've been wanting to read Punisher MAX for ages, but the TPBs are so expensive.  




 What about his Ultimates? 




 Is any of the stuff before worth reading at all? 




 Sometimes, I just can't believe Reddit. 

Do you want to know why i don't like LotR?

* The characters are uninteresting and dull (with the exception of Boromir).
* There's way too many characters. It wasn't hard to follow, I just didn't want to.
* (Only really a problem with the Fellowship) The first one seemed to be aimed at young children with lots of childish jokes and dumb slapstick and dialogue - which then seemed really odd because of some of the darker things in that movie.
* The action is really boring. I spent so much time waiting for something interesting, but it never came.
* It's so slow and so long. There's just so much that doesn't need to be there (like the last 40 minutes of RotK). You could say these moments enhance the world, but it already is so rich and vast those moments just drag.
* The lack of an interesting villain. I don't even know why I should care at times.
* The plot revolves around a MacGuffin and is full of Deus ex Machinas (an army of ghosts? WTF?).
* Too much exposition. 
* Too many subplots that just don't matter to me. Why should I care if Aragon found love or didn't or whatever? I don't care about Aragon.
* There isn't actually that much plot there. Just look at how little Sam and Frodo's story progresses from the end of the Fellowship to their encounter with Gollem in RotK. If you cut out all of their story up to that point, you could still follow along just fine.

Things I did like:

* I respect how well made it is. 
* Good acting. 
* The landscape and environment is just beautiful. 
* Middle-Earth was a pretty rich world by the end of it. 




 Is it reading all of the stuff that came before? i'm very interested in delving into this universe and I don't know whether it'd be worth reading all of it, or just a few. 




 Disappointed to see LotR scoring so I highly. I know it's a controversial opinion on /r/Movies but I really don't LotR. 




 Adam Warlock. I can see him as a wise and powerful guy. 




 Saga, Sex Criminals, Sandman, Wytches, Southern Bastards, Y: The Last Man, Afterlife with Archie and We3 quickly come to mind. 




 So like Vertigo or Image or what-have-you.  




 Or eat. 




 Tony was an interesting new status quo, shame it didn't last long. 




 Excellent, isn't it? IMO, E for Extinction stands as both a great X-Men story and a great Grant Morrison story. 




 Do Tarantino movies count? If so, the Candyland sequence in Django Unchained is jaw dropping. 




 So, the majority of my problems with Nolan movies are Jonathan's fault? 




 I love how this is one of the most iconic pages from the event, yet it wasn't even in the main series. 




 My bad. I actually noticed that on my shelf after writing it. I guess his art isn't great (unless he did the Thanos Quest?). 




 Not really a fan of Theron, but I love the idea of an older woman in the role. There aren't very many good action roles for women over 40 (which Chalize will be when Captain Marvel comes put), so I think it would be great if Marvel decided to help diversify on another level. Fighting sexism and ageism in the industry is a commendable cause, why not got for the trifecta and hire Pam Grier?

Damn, I'd love to see Pam Grier in a Marvel movie.  




 Ultimate Ben is in love with her. 




 His brief run on Thanos (2003) was also excellent, shame it's kind of gone downhill since then. His art can be great though, look at his work on Batman: The Cult. 




 Thanos (2003). It leads into Annihilation if you like it.  




 Are you sure it's not Laurence Fishburne? 




 Shall we expect news on that soon? 




 What's happened to the Titans show? 




 It's not even accurate. This is the second sequel. 




 Also: where's Pepper? Is she completely gone from this franchise now? 




 I'm loving the cynical choice of giving RDJ the first credit. 




 True Detective style time jumps would be awesome.  




 I hope we see more of the 2003 New Mutants than the 80s team. I want to see Prodigy on the big screen.  




 Gotta read his Batman or Marvel Colours work. All of that is absolutely beautiful and can easily reduce one to tears. 




 Hundreds of variants, millions of copies sold, antihero leads and constant rereleases. Anyone else getting dj vu? 




 Don't be a hero? Don't be a fool with your life? 




 Replace Mr Fantastic with the Maker. 




 Beak is my favourite - you just can't help but feel sorry for him.  




 If they do Iron Lad, it better be a time-travelling Kang the Conqueror like in the comics. 




 Bodes well for Civil War and Infinity War. 




 I always sa that as the characters not the movie. I'd struggle to believe that the man who made Jackie Brown could make a racist movie. 




 She was a villain though, then Charlie Day proceeds to try and kill her.  




 That would be a plus of a hard reboot (which I am totally in favour of). 




 Yes. Why? 




 I know, but it is hard to accept any point about racism made by John Wayne and no one in that movie makes a point disagreeing with him. 




 Sexist is the wrong word, but woman are almost always put in the background in action movies. They're typically motivation for men, love interests or there is one woman who kicks ass and no others. They typically are never afforded complex characters as men are.  




 I read that in Luke Cage's voice. 




 I have a similar feeling about racism in The Searchers. Knowing that the Duke was actually a racist, makes it hard to believe that it was just his character talking in that movie. 




 Most modern action movies are inherently sexist. The only ones that I can think of that aren't are the Fast   Furious films. 




 I wish I had a daughter to share Korra and Leslie Knope with. Such great characters. 




 * Seven Samurai
* The Magnificent Seven
* A Bug's Life
* 13 Assassins 




 Stop downvoting this guy. I think he's refer to the 1940s serial. 




 I forgot about Wolverine. It is actually really good. The art - whilst kind of cartoonish - is pretty awesome. Logan looks how I imagine he normally should - rough and tough, rather than the short Superman-esque build I found him looking like in the Avengers books of that era. 









 Front Line, New Avengers, The Confession, Young Avengers/Runaways, The Amazing Spider-Man, Captian America, Winter Soldier - Winter Kills and maybe Iron Man. 

Frankly, apart from Front Line and New Avengers, the others only really are good if you've been reading the character's own series. 









 I must ask if they're doing a hard reboot or a soft reboot. 




 Toy Story 3 




 I can't wait. Any series leading into the new ones or is it a complete reboot? 




 Dick was a better father. 




 I really can't recommend this. Setting aside my feelings for the event - I abhor the main series, but there are some great tie-ins - it's far too expensive to consider getting anything beyond the main series. It'll cost $7 to just get the main series and $112 for the whole event, whereas a Marvel Unlimited subscription is $10/month for all the comics in the event and 13K more.  It just makes more sense, despite the few bonuses that come with Comixology (better smart panels for example). 




 Marvel and DCs current offerings are much more readable, so I'm more lax about that.  




 For me it was Andy giving away his toys and moving on. It was like saying goodbye. 




 Goodfellas, Casino, The Wolf of Wall Street and either The Departed or Taxi Driver. 




 Better than She's the Man. 




 I really like this order, but it's missing a lot of key series. NYX, New X-Men/Mutants, Mike Carey's X-Men, the Vulcan Saga, Origin II, Logan and chunks of Aaron's Wolverine and it is filled with a lot of mediocre books. 




 No pictures of Tatum? I can't wait to see what he looks like playing a character that's quite unconventional for him. 




 No one has mentioned Scarface? 




 I know that movie sucked and he's more of a DC guy, but I'm certainly not adverse to Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson.  




 I love the new team, as a black guy, I love seeing the Falcon and War Machine on the team (even better given the fact they're played by Anthony Mackie and Don Cheadle). That, along with the fact there are twice the number of female team members, really means they've created a much more diverse team so I instantly approve.

Here's hoping Falcon takes other Hawkguy's role as the clown. I think Mackie is perfect for it. 




 I hope it's Doc Strange. I love their relationship, especially when Bendis writes them.  




 3.8... 




 An Incredible Heracles TV series would be awesome. Heracules the Mighty accompanied by Amadeus Cho (with Pup in tow). The theme song writes itself. 




 The main series and Silver Surfer mini were pretty pretty. 




 What do you mean? Immensely popular, but have strong critics? 




 I agree with you. I was actually expanding on your point. Lol

Digge's is so disappoining, starting with the famous death is Guardian Devil, DD was having a massive breakdown that Bendis, Mack and Brubaker handled fantastically handled and Digge just ruined. 




 Worse than everyone who came before Miller? Worse than everyone who came between Nocenti and Smith? 




 I felt it was just randomly thrown into an action sequence. I feel it would have been better in the montage after he escapes the miners or just a sequence of him riding. 




 The dialogue. There's no subtext whatsoever and the characters often just state their emotions. Also, it's a Sci-Fi movie with no David Bowie and that's a sin. L 




 I love this movie so much, so it pains me to say it's too long. 




 Whiplash
