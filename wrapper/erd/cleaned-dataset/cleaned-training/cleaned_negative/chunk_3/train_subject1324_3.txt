 You have ruined my life... Well the next ten minutes, but still

 An upvote to you sir

 It's cool not Corey

 Well in that case, no. No wives involved in this crime 




 That's what cops say to catch people who think that!

 Not enough to count for anything 




 My partner in crime! 




 Well, nobody really knows yet. That's the fun part...
