 This post is a turtle, so what's up with all the fucking bears??? 




 As a single mother, this made my jaw drop. I would never, in a million years, even consider doing something like this!!!  




 It's like, " Oh girl, I just got my child support in, lets go to the club... The comedy club..." What??? 









 Such a dapper fellow. 




 It's still good for a laugh... :) 




 Oh! I had to put in my hearing aid! Got it! 




 At a what? 




 I laughed waaaay too hard at this!!! Thank you!!! 




 I completely agree! Nothing but smiles and tears with this one! 
Heart = Warmed 




 Haha! No! I eat them by two's... 




 Everything I do must be done in even numbers. It seriously pisses me off when I'm eating M Ms and there's an odd number in the bag, or anything else for that matter!! 




 Such a happy puppy! 




 This makes me happy! 




 AWE! Thank you! 




 Yes! She does! But not for breakfast... 




 Tears! OMG! TEARS!!! That was horribly hilarious!!! 




 Every time 




 You keep leaving her at my house, she won't be your puppy for much longer... ;) 




 We just tack her leash to the ceiling... She works great as a fan! 




 That made me laugh out loud!!!  




 Love it! 




 She's the cutest thing I've ever seen! 




 This is Riley. My bf's 7 week old golden retriever. I am just crazy about her!!
