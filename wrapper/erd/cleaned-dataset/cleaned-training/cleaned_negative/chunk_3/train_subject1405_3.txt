 my mistake, the chicken should be part of Step 4 









 Ingredients

1.5 cups of quinoa

1 can of chicken (5 ounces)

broccoli (optional)

2 minced cloves of garlic (about two teaspoons)

2 eggs

cup of milk

at least 1.5 cups of shredded cheddar (I tend to bump this up to 2-2.5 cups)

2-4 tablespoons of sriracha (or a quarter cup)

optionalsprinkle panko for topping.

 

Instructions

1. Briefly saute your veggies. In this case, its broccoli and garlic.

2. Cook the quinoa. I like using a rice cooker to do this.

3. Preheat oven to 350 F. Butter or spray your casserole dish, a 139 works best, make sure its relatively deep like an inch and a half or so.

4. Whisk eggs and milk in a large bowl. Throw in the quinoa, most of the cheese (youll want to have some cheese remaining to sprinkle on the top as it all bakes), sriracha, chicken, and veg and mix well. 

5. Pour into casserole dish. Sprinkle remaining cheese or panko over the top and bake for 30-35 minutes. Once the cheese/panko is brown, its ready to be pulled out and serve.

 more annoyed with a criteria that creates a backline of three centerbacks and a rightback, feel it lends itself to unnecessary confusion 









 And, if you're interested, a friend of mine is pursuing more work in area: https://experiment.com/projects/why-the-long-face-functional-morphology-of-a-unique-fossil-porpoise 












































 I can't help but see him as a perfect CAM, when he's pushed out wide he can still excel but the probability of him being ineffectual rise for the reasons mentioned in the article 






































































































































 I like how Dos Santos is committed to the 4-3-3, but I don't think that the Fury have the midfield linchpin it needs--Donatelli   Ubiparipovic have been good all season but the team needs an anchor 





























 BBQ Chickpea Burgers, http://train_subject1405.wordpress.com/2014/08/29/foodiesphere-bbq-chickpea-burgers/

Like most recipes of mine, this is modified. I cant stand vegans (at least when they talk about being vegan) but there are some great vegan recipes out there that can easily be altered to be real people food.

 

Ingredients

can of chickpeas/garbanzo beans

1/4 cup sunflower seeds

1/4 cup flax seeds

1/4 sesame seeds

2 eggs

2 cloves of garlic

1 red pepper

1/2 red onion

1 carrot (or about 12 baby carrots)

1 cup of BBQ sauce

1-1.5 cups of Panko

 

Step 1: Finely chop the garlic, pepper, onion, carrot, and chickpeas. I used a small food processor. You want it to look kinda goopy and it will be wet. I did the veg first, put it into a large bowl, and then did the chickpeas second mixing the two together in the bowl.

Step 2: Once the veg and chickpeas are well mixed, throw in the BBQ sauce, Panko, eggs, and seeds. Mix these all together. Add more Panko (or breadcrumbs) if you feel you need to thicken it.

Step 3: I have an old George Foreman grill that I use for burgers because I dont have an outdoor grill and I despise pan frying. Roll up the mixture into balls only slightly larger than a golf ball. Plop them down on the grill and let them flatten and cook. Maybe 3-5 minutes for each group or until theyre nice and brown on the outside.

You could probably bake these in an oven as well. Guess would be 350 degrees on a cookie sheet lined with aluminum foil for 15-25 minutes flipping them at least once so theyre brown on both sides.


This should make between 10-15 patties. I would estimate the prep time at around 15 minutes   the cook time at between 20-25. I found eating three to be very filling. 









 it's not looking good for them   even worse for their chances of turning their season around 




 hope it's useful. I'm trying to make it a regular thing so we all can keep tabs on teams we may not follow 




 not much at all really, he's been mostly been a bench option this Fall.  














 I really don't see an issue here. Also think terming buying into MLS as a 'defection' is needlessly adversarial 




 I think you could ask a slew of self-identifying libertarians   they would distance themselves from liberalism. But I can see you're point, though it doesn't really seem to add anything to the author's purpose 



















 I don't think anyone is trying to be malicious or abusive of the rules, just a reminder will do   let us all continue to enjoy content we might not have found on our own 




 "I can't believe the ref allowed San Antonio to throw himself at our 'keeper. Just goes to prove the Scorpions play rugby while we play real soccer." --Faux Wynalda 









 Jake Nutting will be covering as much of the Rowdies as possible for "12," so I'm sure there will be more positives coming 





































































 I like seeing a list like this but I'm resistant to MLS reserve teams being part of it (affiliate teams, fine, but the reserves feels kinda bs-y) 




 sorry, didn't see the overlap. thx for the catch 







































 did you see that match where MNU had white socks? Not okay. But I at collars.  









 what about a third kit that tries to revamp the retro kit of the Minnesota Kicks the team had? 




 32 would be a nice change up but I'd still want the away to be blue 










































































 perhaps it's only a blip, but I've concerns about the declining attendance in Ft. Lauderdale 









 Detroit City FC use this as their anthem. It'd be nice to get a local tune in the chant rotation--something Replacements maybe, Doomtree 















































































 watching it over again, most of the ball is over the line as it rolls along but it never completely goes over. I think it was the right call but Eddies are completely justified in being miffed, that goal would've changed the game entirely 









 Pasher looked to be more of a leftwinger/forward in those highlights, which was mostly of his time in Finland's 3rd tier. I think he played for Lansing United this year in the NPSL. Great video finds 
























 well, I play chess rather poorly   love beer (Untappd: danielcasey). I'd be up for it 









 where were you thinking of doing this? 




 love this crest, the dry-fit shirts are screaming to be rec league jerseys
