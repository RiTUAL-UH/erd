 The survivors can design the memorial. 




 We all know the cinematic tropes in cinema for the various accents of the world as expressed by Hollywood films. However, as somebody who hasn't experienced as much foreign cinema as he'd like, I'd love to pose a question to you, non-Americans of Reddit. How are the various accents of the United States (Southeastern, Boston, Californian, et al) portrayed in the culture of your country?  









 Also, ants can carry them off in the night. 





























 I've long been of the belief that cat declawing is an awful thing to do to the animals. The bulk of evidence I've seen seems to agree with this point of view, and it's been gaining a lot of supporters as of late.

HOWEVER: it would seem as though the American Veterinary Medical Association and several other reputable veterinary groups disagree with this assertion. While I tend to agree with scientific and medical establishments, there's no doubt that there's money to be made on declawing, so it seems as though they've got something at stake here. Add to that that the American anti-declawing movement originated in hippy-esque circles which aren't really known for their adherence to science, and I have doubts. 

I was wondering where the skeptic community falls on this issue and if there were any resources out there that might make a case for declawing not being harmful.

 Okay, so this is a long shot, but there was an incredibly catchy music video played at the beginning of the Dub Your Own Hentai track with surprisingly high production values and showing surprisingly little in the way of nudity. Does anyone happen to have it? 




 So they've been handing out those buttons for free Momocon passes if you should happen to find your match. Why not have a Reddit thread to try to find our opposites?

I'll start. Mine is 624 
























 As a disabled man, getting around the con is somewhat difficult. I feel that having a room in a host hotel would alleviate this to a degree, but no matter how early I check, they seem to be booked up. What's the most reliable way of getting a room at one of the big five? 









 This is going to be big, people. 







































 Until the 80s, the US had been a leading participant in the World's Fairs, and many of those held on US soil have become regional and national cultural touchstones. Why has the US seemingly dropped all involvement in World's Fairs? 




 They're both about evil shadowy groups of supernatural baddies conspiring to take over humanity and they both have persistent screen captions as an integral, tangible part of the universe. Fringe is simply Kill la Kill's Boston.

Karma, plz. 














 It doesn't make sense to me. The best I can figure is that COMPNOR needed an enemy for the widespread human majority to hate and aliens were a convenient target.  









 It may be due to the rose colored fog of nostalgia pervading the game, but for me, Metal Gear Solid's music just felt so much more atmospheric and evocative than the music in Metal Gear Solid 2 and its' successors. It could just be due to how much I fell in love with the game, but MGS1's duel music and cutscene music just stuck with me so much more. Am I alone in this assessment? I get that it's all completely down to taste and there are no wrong answers, but I'm dying to know how everyone else feels about this. 









 In the BioShock series, the city of Rapture is shown to be an astounding testament to mankind's technical expertise and the tenacity of the "utopian" vision of Andrew Ryan.

In the viral game Something in the Sea, we are shown that the initial construction of Rapture (with stage I being completed in late 1946) is financed by shell companies such as Warden Yarn who buy large quantities of materiel from Scarlet Sovereign with these contracts then being reneged upon receipt of the raw materials. 

This presents a problem, however. With Ryan disappeared to Rapture and his shell companies on the surface surely made pariahs by his lack of payment on large contracts, he was surely cut off from receiving raw materials from sources on the surface. However, we're told that Rapture continued to expand until 1951. This surely would have required a vast amount of material well in excess of the sums we're shown in the Scarlet Sovereign receipts. Further, any civic planner worth a damn would have a setup for procuring additional materials for repairs and expansion to keep pace with population growth.

Now, as we're not shown any sort of method by which Rapture can quarry stone or mine ores and the trees in Arcadia are surely insufficient for providing lumber in addition to oxygenating the city, I've got to wonder: where did the additional raw materials for Raptures maintenance and expansion come from?  




 Everyone stopped moving and it's just really annoying and inconvenient.  









 I know that Cerberus owns many front organizations and cover businesses and was originally a branch of Alliance intelligence, but how do they possibly have the dosh to acquire and cultivate all of their scientific and military talent? How do they finance their fleets of warships and dropships and improbable androids with complex smart AI? 

Inquiring minds demand answers! 









 I'm going to momocon for the first time on Saturday, and I'm curious as to whether or not they have a disability services booth or something similar as Dragoncon has. As a guy in a wheelchair, the disability services badges have always been a huge help in letting me enjoy panels, and I'm hoping momocon has something similar. However, I couldn't find it on their website. 




 Additionally, how is Lenin viewed in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Ukraine, the Baltic states and other former Soviet republics?

 Wat do? 




 My girlfriend and I are looking for rooms as we were bumped from our previously arranged accommodations. We'd prefer something close and for some privacy, both because I'm in a wheelchair. What are our chances of finding something this late? 




 I have a tremendous fondness for 9x18mm and the general idea of compact-ish combloc pistols really holds a dear place in my heart and in my hands. However, no gun store or pawn shop seems to have them and I prefer to avoid dealing with online purchases - even though they seem to lack these pistols as well. 

And so, I turn to /r/gunsforsale. I would like to offer some delicious leafy green cashy money to anybody in the Gainesville, GA area who might be willing to sell me one of these weapons. I am highly negotiable on prices, and I can start at $120 for a PA-63. More for a Makarov PM or CZ-82. I also have a genuine Soviet Tokarev without importer stamps that I could be persuaded to trade, if you prefer. 

Shoot me a reply if you're interested! 









 I am currently unemployed and in the Atlanta area - just north of the city, OTP, and I'm looking for work. On the writing front, I've written gaming reviews and articles for massvio.com and gamegeex.com, as well as reams of unpublished poetry and short form fiction. I'll write just about anything, really, though articles are my forte.

As for voice acting, I'm just breaking into it though I have - as a matter of curiosity - received some informal coaching and advice on the matter from Mike Dowling, audio lead at Obsidian Entertainment. 

Really, I'm willing to do anything else that pays as long as it isn't too physical, as I'm a paraplegic amputee. However I am much more capable than most people would think. Don't be shy, drop me a PM!

I'd put my resume here, but I haven't got any prior work history beyond my writing and I tend to keep my portfolio closed to all but serious enquirers. I assure you, however, that I am highly qualified for a wide variety of tasks. Should you chose to grant me some form of interview, I promise you'll come away from the experience quite impressed. Of this, you can rest assured.

 Do we do trading in this subreddit? I have a ton of Soviet Cold War militaria in storage (that I intend to get pictures of as soon as I can get to it) that I'd love to let circulate. I've held on to them for quite some time and I have quite a few duplicates.

Two sets of Soviet uniform pants and jacket - one enlisted, one officer's.

A Soviet pilotka cap.

A Soviet militsiya visor cap.

Several medals and miscellaneous objects that I need to inventory.

An East German helmet, field jacket, and AK magazine pouch.

And more! If you're curious, ask me as to what all I have and what I'm willing to trade. 














 I like to take a light touch with management in regards to this place, but people have been complaining about the "childhood fears" trend ruining the overall quality of the place. I will begin treating as we do copypasta and removing it while referring the posters of such submissions to relevant subreddits. Thank you all for your cooperation. If this policy is unwelcome, please voice your opinions below. I can always undo this if people want the childhood crap to stay, but I personally agree with the complaints and find them well grounded.  



















 December 26 and we can put the LD out of our R! She won't be here in time for Christmas, but I really don't care in the slightest. After a year and a half of being at opposite ends of the United States, she's finally moving here. I just wanted to share my elation with you all.

EDIT: A big thanks to everyone congratulating us. I hope our success can inspire you all to stick in there for as long as it takes. I know we weren't as far apart or as long separated as many of you, but it's still a relief that she'll be coming home at last.

EDIT 2: It got bumped up a day. I just ordered tickets... AND SHE'LL BE HERE FOR CHRISTMAS! SO MUCH HAPPY. 









 In 1863, the Union Army of the Potomac under Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker and Maj. Gen. George G. Meade is routed at Gettysburg, dissolving in a disorganized retreat from Confederate military forces under General Robert E. Lee after a decisive Confederate cavalry raid by General JEB Stuart breaks the Union forces in the area. 

With the road to Washington wide open, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States of America, signs the Confederate drafted Instrument of Surrender which recognizes the right of the Confederate States of America to exist and protects the legal right of states to leave the Union as they so choose. Over night, Confederate governments spring up in the border states and the economic and military power of the United States slides slowly into irrelevance. After several decades of Union losses and Confederate gains in the West and in the Caribbean and Mexico, the Confederacy enters the 20th century as the dominant power in North America.

In the 1930s, the South falls on hard economic times as the world plunges into the Great Depression. The South's former slaves, freed by act of President Gustave Tutant Beauregard in 1917 in reaction to fears of reaction by anarchist radicals, are still horribly oppressed and are now denied even the meager wages of the sharecropping farms that have gone under in reaction to decreased demand from factories in Europe and the border states of the Confederacy. Uniting with prominent Southern Communists and dissatisfied veterans of the Confederate actions against Mexico in World War I, they march on Richmond and seize the capitol, executing President Thomas Hardwick and installing a vanguard party, headed by a Stalinst strongman to oversee the Confederacy. 

On 5, May 1932, The Confederate States are reorganized into The Soviet Confederacy of America; a Workers' state in direct alliance with the Soviet Union. All they need now... is a flag.

tl;dr - supposing in an alternate history, the Confederacy stuck around long enough to be overthrown by commies. What would their flag look like?


I've always loved the symbolism of Communist countries and the Confederate States of America. Had I an eye for design and a better computer, I'd puzzle out what this flag might look like myself. I don't. What I do have, though, is imagination. With this short, plothole riddled alternate history yarn, I hope that /r/vexillology can whip up a flag that would bring this improbable nation more vividly into the imagination. Thanks! 





























 In the 2005 film adaptation, I believe the original intent of the book has been altered somewhat. When we first see a tripod, a tremendous noise is heard emanating from its carapace. I believe this to be the flatulence of the alien pilots, who have left their homeworld to pass wind in order to be polite. I have evidence to back up my theory.

1. The plants: these aren't for terraforming, as one might think. The aliens just have bad hygeine and the mushrooms that grow in their bathrooms left spores that follow them to Earth.

2. The fact that everyone is screaming and running away. I don't know about you, but I'd love to hang out with a giant alien robot... unless it was farting.

My final evidence is the most important fact on which this theory hinges. At the end, all the tripods collapse and the aliens within fall out and die. To me, this clearly shows that their own fumes were so noxious that it killed them.

I'll take my internet points, now. 









 With this new subreddit, I must personally confess that I don't know as much about Leninist theory as I'd like to. While I'm researching, the fact is that in the meantime I will need dedicated mods who are well versed in the writings of Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, and V. I. Lenin to help me in running this subreddit. 

If this describes you, or if you have CSS experience and can help us design a decent page, I'd greatly appreciate your input. Apply below for modhood, comrades, and help us move the discussion forward. 




 New subscriber here, come from a fit of nostalgia that got me back into the franchise as of late. One thing I've always found appealing about the series was the soundtrack, especially in the original Metal Gear Solid.

My question here is this, though. Why did TAPPY stop handling the soundtracks? To me, the music contributed to a sense of atmosphere that none of the subsequent games could ever recapture, even when MGS4 [revisited Shadow Moses Island](/spoiler). Was a reason ever given for this or is it left as mysterious as the exclusion of the FAMAS from subsequent games? 

Again, Harry Gregson-Williams was just fine but his music made the latter games feel somewhat disconnected from the first Metal Gear Solid. It's nothing against him, he's just not TAPPY. 
























 I'm typing this on my phone, so please bare with me.

Recently, my laptop died. It had been the only way my fiance and I had of seeing each other and now that she's gone back to college, We now have no way of going to sleep together and it's really wearing on us. 

My question to you, /r/longdistance, is what you would regard as the least expensive device that can run Skype from a bed. Tablets and netbooks are in play, but not smartphones as my contract isn't up for some time. Advice? 




 In ten short - yet oh so long - hours my SO will be here in Atlanta from Berkeley. All the excite, my fellow LDR-ers. ALL THE EXCITE. 



















 Seriously. I haven't been smoking for long. I only discovered it at 21 and it's a year later but you guys have made it the best thing I've ever gotten into. So here's a self telling you guys you rock and spreading the good cheer. Peace, ents. [4] 









 It is as it is. I can't have any nut products and most of the AVB products I've seen that don't require cooking are peanut butter sandwiches and nutella and the like. I can't have any nut products whatsoever, so I have to ask: what can I put my AVB in and enjoy it with that won't send me to the ER? 




 Hello, Reddit. I am train_subject1458. I decided to do an AMA as I am getting into voice acting and I'd love very much to have a decent demo tape to use. However, I'm not necessarily the most creative sort so I thought I'd ask my favorite internet community to help me out a bit. 

So here's how we play this game. You leave me a quote - anything within reasonable length - and I'll render it for you in my glorious voice or else in my best approximation of a voice of your choosing. 

Some details, first, though. 
I am a 22 year old man from Georgia, in the United States. I can do passable high status British, genteel Southern, modern redneck, Morgan Freeman, and so many, many other voices. If you can name it, I'll give it the old college try. 

Ready? Alright, then. Let us begin.

 I am dreadfully curious about this. Apparently, my vocal skills are - according to people I know - quite good and I have a natural knack for speaking. Further, my SO frequently tells me that I should look for work in voice acting. As a fan of video games and animation, I would be delighted to do something along these lines, but I have no idea where to start. Any advice?

EDIT: [HAVE A LINK!](http://vocaroo.com/i/s09VAwAMENWP)
It's a vocaroo demo of my voice clocking it at around eight minutes as I read the Raven by Edgar Allan Poe. I have a much greater range than this, I think, but for the time being this is the sort of character that I think I'm best at portraying. 




 wut do? 


































 For me, it's Morrowind. I can't even begin to count all the times I've reinstalled that game. I love it so very dearly.

Honorable mention: Jedi Outcast. 




 I recently acquired an RAI 1911 tactical and, while I couldn't be happier with it, the slide is not to my liking. I'd always admired the look of GI-style 1911 slides and even though the sight picture is inferior, I think I'd like to trade if anyone is willing. 

My slide has some light finish wear, so I'm willing to accept less than pristine slides. If anyone is interested, please let me know!

 I'm 22 and I'm in a wheelchair. This Saturday, I'm flying across the country to see my fiancee who I've not seen in months. Now, I should be elated, but instead I can't help but be incredibly fucking nervous. Why?

The Transportation Security Administration, the people we Americans tolerate so willingly for the illusion of feeling safe are going to absolutely violate me. I am certain of this. Why? Well, they haven't got the best track record with people in general, but add to it that they [have](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zFi18ioqYk) [a](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2116881/TSA-subject-child-wheelchair-invasive-airport-security-tests-Chicago.html) [shitty history](https://gripevine.com/gripe/20731929/tsa-agents-abuse-disabled-travelers-pbi-west-palm-beach-airport) in dealing with disabled persons, I can't help but feel intimidated. I look at how we're willing to just accept this from my government as our economy continues to implode and I can't help but weep. I can't fight, but I can't help but feel I'd sympathize with and possibly even join up with a populist uprising if ever we had one. 

So my question to you is this. What would the government have to take from *you* to make you tell them that enough is enough?

 The gun show is on Saturday and I've got $250 to get a new handgun and I want your opinions. Here are my criteria:

* Steel frame
* Semi auto
* External hammer
* Manual safety
* Compact
* Affordable ammunition
* Rugged

Caliber and recoil are secondary concerns as I've got some pretty good arms on me and my shot placement is decent enough at self defense ranges so I don't need excessive stopping power. 

I should also say that I'd like something that would hide on a wheelchair fairly well. Paraplegic here, so wheelchair carry demands compactness and reliability. 

My frontrunner so far is a milsurp CZ82, but I'm open to suggestions. 









 After six months; a bad incident that cancelled one of her plane tickets and countless exams, a fuckton of heartache and thousands of hours on Skype, my fiancee has gotten her plane ticket and will be here in JUST OVER A WEEK! 

Excitements all around, ladies and gentlemen.

We shall be in the Atlanta area, if any LDR-ers are interested in hanging out.
