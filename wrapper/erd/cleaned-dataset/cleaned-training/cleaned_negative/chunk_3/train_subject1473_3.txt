 Probably has a Mercedes engine. 




 I find it kind of bizarre to see 67 ads for DeSotos and 132 for Volgas on the same site. 









 Hand built, expensive materials, fine wood and leather, state of the art technology and entertainment system, complex engineering, and custom options. 









 Infiniti G25x/35x/37x should be available in that price range has AWD. 




 You could probably buy something 5-15 years old with under 100k for $9,000 or less if it belonged to a senior citizen. 




 1980-83 Lincoln Mark VI. A smaller, boxier derivative of the earlier Mark V. It was the first and only Mark Series available as both a sedan and a coupe. Today, they are among the rarest of the Panther platform cars. 




 Honda Fit, Toyota Yaris, Mazda 2 would be a few more options. A 150k modern car can still be reliable and if you are just driving to the train station, mileage shouldn't matter as much. 




 A number of Cadillacs look RWD when they are actually FWD. The DTS, XTS, 1994-99 DeVille, 1972-78 Eldorado, and 1979-85 Eldorado. 









 Don't forget about the old non-American made vehicles there, Soviet and European mostly. Not sure how big the market for 70s-90s Soviet vehicles is in the US, but if you want a Lada 2101, Niva, Volga, or Chaika and are in the U.S., I would imagine that importing one from Cuba would be easier than from Europe since it's closer. They should be cheap when all the other collectors are in a frenzy for 50s American cars. There is also that rumor about a Mercedes 300SL Gullwing sitting under a banana tree. If the Gullwing isn't too far gone, that should be a seven-digit car.

I also wonder how cars from today, or even 20 years ago will seen to a Cuban who has been driving an old jalopy all their life. Going from driving a 57' to even an 87' car is a big change, so a 2015 model may feel space age. 




 I am planning to renounce my American citizenship within 10 years. I originally planned on going on a trip to Cuba to celebrate no longer being American, but seeing as Cuba may become open to Americans by the time I renounce it, I would like some other suggestions. I am looking to celebrate by doing something that U.S. citizens cannot do, and likely in a place where U.S. citizens cannot go. 




 Dodge St. Regis, Merkur XR4ti 









 1979 Pontiac Bonneville Brougham 




 How highly illegal is it there? In the US, most traffic violations are considered low tier misdemeanors. 




 Crown Vic, Mercury Grand Marquis, Lincoln Town Car, W body Imapla, Taurus/Sable, Saturns, 10-15 y/o Buicks. You might be able to get something a little nicer if it was built in the 80s or 90s. Aim for cars owned by elderly people, as they tend to be well maintained with low miles. 




 The 80s Quattroporte is blander, http://www.curbsideclassic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IMG_0306.jpg 









 They say desperation is the mother of creativity. 




 You mean because boxy 70s-80s American cars are colloquially known as "boxes"? 




 But the Toyota Hilux seems to be the truck that has become stereotypically associated with Middle Eastern terrorists. 









 70s-80s RWD,boxy, full-size American cars. (E.g. Caprice Classic, LTD Crown Victoria, Chrysler Fifth Avenue). Most enthusiasts disregard these cars as bland and stodgy, but I actually think they should be looked at on the same level as W123s and Volvo 240s. Just like those European cars, these cars are also boxy, conservative, slow, un-sporty, and simple to work on. I like the earlier oversized versions too, but these seem to be more notably made fun of. 









 I find it ironic that these terrorists would choose to use a Ford truck if they are so vehemently anti-American. 









 Interesting, both are cars sold in Canada, but never the US. 









 Mercedes-Benz 560SEC and 1979 Lincoln Town Coupe 




 OP didn't specify the type of title, but I guess this Passat could have come to that point where minor damage can result in being totaled because of its low value. 




 Wow! Never thought a running car that cheap could be anything other than a 35 year old, dirty, beat up, unreliable POS that makes the owner look like they live in the poorhouse. 









 Chrysler R-Body cars. 




 GG Allin 




 Today it is not unusual to see a 1980s or 90s car in regular use depending on where you are, but how common was it to see cars continue to be used at this age in the past? For example 30s cars in the 50s or 50s cars in the 70s. 




 Mercedes E class coupe 4Matic, Toyota Supra and Celica Alltrac, Nissan Skyline GTR. 




 Chrysler 300 and Mercedes W126, 1990-93 Infiniti Q45 and 1992-94 Ford Crown Victoria, 1980-89 Lincoln Town Car and Rolls-Royce Silver Spirit.

 This is the era when most on this subreddit say there were few, if any good American cars to choose from, but I dissagree. 









 As well as it's stablemates, the supercharged Olds 98 and LSS, and the supercharged Pontiac Bonneville SSEi

 Late 60's Olds Toronado or Cadillac Eldorado 




 It does seem like cars of this type are very easy to find with low miles and there are likely more nice examples than there is demand. These late 70's land yachts don't have the same cache or icon status as those from the 50's and 60's. I have noticed many are now being exported to Europe, possibly for their lower prices here and uniqueness over there. At what point in the future, if ever might this be considered an appropriate price?


Here's another similarly priced 79', but MJC cars are typically way overpriced, http://www.mjcclassiccars.com/1979-pontiac-bonneville-landau/ 









 The Olds Cutlass Supreme diesel was pretty dreadful even for it's time, especially in sedan form. 









 We have seen quite a few "what older car still looks current/has aged the best" threads, so what about the reverse? 




 Mercedes C65 AMG 




 1960 Chevrolet Impala Sport Coupe, Toyota Century, Mercedes-Benz E63 AMG S 




 Malaise era American cars. They will be easier to get going again than new cars and by then there will not be anyone alive who remembers how bad they were when new. 









 The 1.8l 90hp 4cyl engine in the R32 Nissan Skyline GXi. 




 It seems that way, especially since R32 Skylines and E30 Tourings are now legal, with more coming soon. I have seen companies claiming to have imported hundreds of cars using this rule. In say, 2004, when 1979 cars became legal to import how much did the number of 25+ year old foreign cars being imported to the US compare to the current numbers? 




 It's a shame the Olds Diesel was such a terrible engine, because diesel-powered full sized American cars seem like a good idea. How are there any still running? 




 Nice, Lexus is really stepping up their game, but having to put a front license plate on is gonna suck. 




 Actually it is because when I go into Queens and Brooklyn, I tend to see a lot of dilapidated 10-20 year old MBs, BMWs, and Lexuses that seem to be driven by people who don't have the money to maintain them, so they just become beaters and eventually lawn ornaments. Small parts for a ten year old S-Class Mercedes can go for hundreds of dollars, or at least a very high amount compared to a 10 year old midrange car. I can see the cost of parts and service, as well as gas causing a lot of problems for the low or even average income owner of an older, high mileage luxury car. Those who know better avoid these cars because of their running costs which makes them dirt cheap to buy for people who know nothing about cars and don't do research before buying. I always think of different questions that I can post here or other subreddits while I am bored or daydreaming. 
























 There seems to be far more ten year old cars that still look up to date today than there were ten years ago. 




 G25, Q45, LS430, W220, DTS 




 Acura TL, VW Phaeton 




 - BMW 3 Series
- W203/204 C-Class Mercedes
- Infiniti Q45
- 2002-08 Acura TL
- First year Jaguar XFs are getting cheap 




 I've heard about them too. These are actually US market Pontiac G8s, GTOs, and SSes that have been rebodied as utes/Maloos or converted into Commodores. They have all that is needed to comply with US regs. Everything from the Australian cars fits right on to one of the US cars since they are all rebadged Holdens. 




 The R34 is one that will not be importable until 2023, but yes, the early 90s includes some of the most sought after forbidden fruits. This is the list of federalization-eligible cars, some of which are now over 25 years old: http://www.nhtsa.gov/CARS/RULES/IMPORT/elig101012c.pdf. I once remember hearing that in 1995 less than 300 cars were imported this way. There is a W210 Mercedes with out of state plates which appears to be euro spec that I have seen around these parts from time to time. Not sure if it is a legal import, illegal import, or US model that has been converted to look like a Euro car. 
























 But I mean with the same characters and setting. 









 The shooting brake CLS and all generations of the C wagon except for the W203 are not available in the US or Canada. The CLA shooting brake is not planned to arrive on our shores either. I mean "convert" as in bring over a wagon body, take the sedan body from the US spec car off the chassis, and replace it with the wagon body. Though this may sound very hard to do and far fetched, I'm actually surprised I can't find any evidence of anyone here doing so. There is a company in Colorado that converts the Pontiac G8, GTO and Chevy SS into a Holden Ute (Australian pickup car) by doing this and I have seen pictures of S-Class sedans with SEC/CL front clips, as well as a W124 with a W210 front. With this Colorado company claiming to have done over 30 conversions and having stumbled across all sorts of Mercedes frankencars online, it surprises me that I haven't found this yet. I'm sure a CLA45, C63 or CLS63 AMG converted to a wagon would probably be a major attraction at any Cars and Coffee or European car meet over here. 




 I have seen W126s and W123 diesels with Cummins swaps in them, so why not put them in cars like the late 70s-early 80s Chevrolet Caprice, Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham, or Buick Regal. The factory diesel engines were terrible, so a Cummins or Duramax should make the cars run better than ever and be kind of badass. They are already set up to run on diesel fuel, so it shouldn't be that hard to do this kind of swap. They would make pretty cool/ironic tow vehicles. 




 I have thought about moving to Canada because of the import laws, but then I do more thinking and realize I have to choose between 15+ year old imports and more rust, colder weather, and a higher cost of living or 25+ year old imports, less or no rust depending on location, warmer weather, and a lower cost of living. 














 Does that mean I should remove it from here? 





























 Are you in Quebec, because I once saw a picture of a terribly rusty Mazda 3 with Quebec plates somewhere. It was stated that such rust on 5-15 year old Mazdas there was not uncommon. 




 One of my neighbors had a Hyundai that was smashed to oblivion and looked like it would fall apart any minute when it was only four years old but still drove it because he says his ex wife was a really bad driver. 



















 It looks so 80s. Cars with trendy, loud styling don't usually age very well. 




 Is it really that dated looking? I actually think it has aged better than most cars of its age. It would have guessed that the M45 was an 08' at newest if I knew nothing about it, which is very impressive considering that the design is now 15 years old (available in Japan before the US). 









 No, NY Metro area 




 Mercedes E and C Class, BMW 3 Series, Honda Accord are the most common. Saw an early 90s Lexus GS300 today for the first time in years here. I used to often see a 1978 Chevy Malibu that was a daily driver. Never saw another one around here, it was in really bad condition and I think it died a few months ago. 

Edit: Just remembered once seeing a Lexus LFA. 




 The Soviet W123 




 1971-72 Cadillac Eldorado 




 I have noticed that in recent years, Japan has been producing less and less cool Japan-only cars. At the same time, a U.S. based interest in certain Holdens from Australia has developed. This has led to some Pontiac G8, Chevrolet Caprice PPV, and Chevrolet SS owners applying Holden badges and parts to their cars. A smaller number have even gone to great lengths to do full HSV and Ute conversions. I have also noticed a small but growing number of Australian classics for sale in the US, including Ford XB Falcons, Holden Monaros, and 1950's Chevy and Ford Utes. So will AUDM in North America keep growing and potentially have the kind of popularity, industry, and silliness that JDM has or is it just a minor fad?

 "Older " means 20+ years 




 Malaise era cars 




 What I mean is why does an image of Chucky or a horde of zombies create a stronger initial feeling of terror than images of serial killers or large, vicious animals. 









 - Daily Turismo
- Petrolicious
- Japanrse Nostalgic Car
- Old Parked Cars
- The Street Peep 









 I'll start by saying the Mustang II would be Scrappy Doo. Both are smaller derivatives of something iconic, unloved, and the result of misguided marketing 









 e.g. McGill is the Harvard of Canada, Fred Phelps is the GG Allin of evangelists.
 














 The 1M is already appreciating. 




 Not just regular future classics, what are the cars of 1990-now that will sell for stupid money in the way that muscle cars often do? 




 25+ year old imports are legal in CA but are not smog exempt. It would be very hard, or at least expensive to make this car comply with CA smog regs. Some get inspections done at shops that will falsify results. 




 Looks like a Japanese grandma car, but still might get noticed by the most hardcore of Skyline fanboys. 




 Many have done RHD conversions with their Honda Civics and Acura Integras to make them look JDM. Like what this Buick owner did, it is a good way to waste money on something only 2% of the population will pay attention to. Conversions like this are interesting to see, but not necessarily practical to do.  




 1999-02 Mercedes E55 AMG 




 I have also seen guys who put Skyline badging on their G35s but keep the Infiniti emblem. 














 The W123 interestingly seems to be one of the few slow cars that is a regular topic on car enthusiast forums and websites. Not that there's anything wrong with that. 




 This is just theoretical. Used or modified cars would be acceptable. I have read that there are tuning companies who can manufacture chips and other parts that will make a 10-15 year old AMG or M car have HP and torque which is in some cases far higher than the Hellcat. Such a car could be purchased stock and clean for $10-30k and have $5-10k worth of upgrades done. It would be less expensive to buy and might beat a Hellcat on a track, but would be a maintenance nightmare. Still, would be interesting to see something like this happen. 
























 Reminds me of these commercials http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/ad-day-dead-mice-act-out-plays-strangest-pest-control-ads-ever-160615 



















 The 90s Civics and Accords continue to routinely top the list of most stolen cars, but I'm starting to see less of them on the road and most of the ones I do see are getting increasingly ratty. Will they still be frequently stolen in 5-10 years? 




 And hermits aren't too far removed. 



















 Got two old American land yachts for the price of one,

- http://newyork.craigslist.org/lgi/cto/4711162340.html - 1965 Chevy Impala Sport Sedan $2250 81k, a bit rough.

- http://newyork.craigslist.org/lgi/cto/4678456768.html - 1988 Lincoln Town Car $2500 68k miles, the closest you can get to mint in this price range.

- and $250 left over. 

The Metro NY craigslist is also littered with rough, high mileage 70's-90's German Cars
 




 The Korean car brands, Hyundai and Kia during the 1990's-early 2000's were seen as cheap and boring, but today make competitive cars. Daewoo had a similar image but instead, practically dropped of the map in 2003 (unless you regard the Chevy Aveo as one) rather than getting any farther.

 Velour, "Brougham" packages, more expressive colors. 









 Particularly the ES models 




 As in a luxury car that has the styling of something you would not expect to be all that luxurious. 




 How bad are Rovers really, I'm an American so I look at them on the surface as a European version of Acura. 




 I have noticed some striking similarities and differences between the two.

Similarities

- Both are large luxury sedans from non-luxury brands.
- Both have trouble holding their value and like the Phaeton, the Equus will likely be a huge bargain after it is discontinued.
- Both have relatively conservative, anonymous styling.
- Both have been slow sellers.
- Both are relatively obscure compared to their competition.
- both were intended to be halo cars.

Differences

- One is from an experienced manufacturer of luxury cars, the other isn't.
- Hyundais are generally more reliable and cheaper to maintain than Volkswagens.
- One has a V8 as it's largest engine, the other has a W12.
- Hyundai has established a "cheap" reputation with many, while Volkswagen has established an "affordable" reputation.
- The VW is hand built, the Hyundai is not.
- The material quality of the Equus may not be as good as the Phaeton. 




 While automotive technology and safety is changing quickly, it seems that cars are also aging better. 10 years ago, a 20 year old car had a harder time blending into modern traffic and was often more decrepit looking than most 20 year old cars today. 40 years ago, a a 10 year old car was probably on it's last legs and the difference between it and a new car was like night and day. Today many, if not most 10 year old cars still feel modern and have plenty of travel left.

For example, imagine a 1999 Lexus LS400 with 80,000 miles today vs. a 1960 Chevrolet Impala with 80,000 miles in 1975. Both are 15 years old, but one still looks and feels relatively modern if in good shape and will last a few more years, while the other seems ancient compared to a new car and isn't too far from hitting the junkyard. 




 - Full size 70s and 80s American Behemoths (Think Lincoln Continental, Chevrolet Caprice Classic) - Everyone seems to think they are ugly and uninspiring. I rarely see them features by the mainstream automotive media. But I think they are quite attractive and interestingly many are somehow ostentatious and conservative at the same time.
- BMW E23 - Seems to be the least loved 7 Series and least loved BMW of its era. 
- JDM luxury cars both new and old (Think Toyota Century, Toyota Crown, Nissan Cedric). I can remember Jeremy Clarkson ragging on these, as well as my first category quite a few times.
- Boxy 1980's JDM mid-level luxury cars and sport sedans, especially the ones with turbos or superchargers. Similar what I said above, but while cars like the Century have a distinct appearance and presence, most non car people outside Japan would probably assume a 1980-something Toyota Crown or Mark II GT Twin Turbo is just a regular old Camry.
- Every generation of the Mazda Cosmo.
- Hyundai Equus - It's big and looks super elegant but loses value real quickly. I could see it becoming the next VW Phaeton.
