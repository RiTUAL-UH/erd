 truth hurts 



















 And a BIG THANKS to u/chinstrap for another great week of Check-ins!  Who's doing Next week's Check-in? 
























 I'm not anti-second amendment, I'm anti-perversion of 2d amendment to defend individual gun violence as some sort of God-given right of man.  It' ain't. 




  You're not getting my point. I never said you were wrong, I said you were too biased.

That's like saying "I didn't call you an asshole, I said you were an anus."  The ignorance is in this weird and phony historic-isms to manufacture neutral meaning for a racist symbol.  It's like arguing the swastika is just a benign Sanskrit good luck symbol.

 




 All "libruls" are tired of racism and gun violence in the name of distortions of claimed "states rights" and 2d amendment perversions. 




 Um. you're re-framing racism.  They LOST that war. 




 In 2001 I celebrated 15 years of continuous sobriety, but I felt as you are expressing in this post.  I felt like I had accomplished alot; I was sponsoring; professionally, I was doing the best work of my life and not enjoying the financial rewards that I felt like I was due; I was frequently enraged; and, finally, I relapsed.  The relapse miraculously ended in 2009. My [story is fairly well documented in the Saturday Share](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/25u6cc/saturday_share_im_train_subject1576_and_i_am_an_alcoholic/) so I won't repeat it here.  My lesson: give TIME, TIME.  They like to say in AA: "don't leave the room before the miracle occurs."  This advice in my experience is totally true.  It's harder, much harder to come back and dig out of the damage--but, miracles of change in the human experience happen around us all the time, and if we're patient, within, too.

 I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; I am SOBER in Cleveland after a tough but constructive week. 














 Go for it--many of the SD sobernauts are in the rooms.  We're waiting on you! 




 Honestly, I don't get what Ohio voters are understanding about this pro-biz court.  The Ohio supremes are all about the 1%. 




 Are you working a recovery program?  Seeing a counselor?  Those things were invaluable to me when I was newly sober.  The AA 12 Steps for instance offer a systematic approach to identifying issues, and clearing away the wreckage of the past. 




 Welcome /u/dan_doomhammer to /r/stopdrinking -- so have you [tried the Baby Steps?](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/38ohrj/new_here_the_baby_steps_are_a_pretty_good_place/)  Its a post that lays out what I did to stop drinking and to get sober.  Lots of SDers use aspects of it or so I'm told, to start stopping. 

Good luck to you. 




 Welcome /u/omarhajar84 to r/stopdrinking.  So at [this link is a post called the Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which lays out exactly the next steps I took to start stopping.  I hope something there resonates for you.  To talk to the SD community in real time [try the chat at this link.](http://is.gd/rsdirc)  Good luck. 




 no problen 














 . . . mas guacamole, por favor. 




 That is exactly right.  Purely pandering. 




 This is the number one reason I will never vote for Jeb Bush.  He used the power of his office to enact a private law to intervene and prolong the "life" of this dead woman against her husband's wishes.   





























 Why don't your join us on r/stopdrinking?  We have a great sober community there and you also qualify for r/dinos--I'll send you an invite. 














 This is probably going to shock my friends on SD, but yes I believe that there are some people for whom controlled drinking works; but, I'm not that person.  Not only, am I not that person, I can't even get in the head of someone who would think controlled drinking is a good thing, although at one time I thought it would be nice to drink just fine wines--when I was in my pre-relapse home cooking phase and watching Food TV in the day when they had real cooking shows with teaching chefs.  The reality is that after 15 continuous years of sobriety my "controlled drinking" spun wildly out of control after about 2 weeks and then it took me 7 long hellish years to get back to recovery.  I have fully answered the question for myself--why would I want to?  I only ever wanted that elusive sensation that I got from drinking (or so I told myself) and after I relapsed, I discovered to my satisfaction that all I really ever could do was drink myself into stupor.  





























 The expression: Vanity Fair is a literary allusion to Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress--where the pilgrims after true spirituality are drawn to the material and absurd--debasing their quest for true connection. 




 I'm trying to remember ever meeting an alcoholic who LIKED being told what to do.  I'm sure there are one or two, but they're rare.  I love giving advice and I hate taking it; but I guarantee you that when I finally right-sized my ego, the good advice that I took worked out well for me.  

I love AA and AA meetings, but over time--not drinking, actively listening, I learned who I should listen to, and who I could discount.  Believe it or not, after awhile, people I discounted started to make a bit more sense.  Funny, that. 









 Jack London was a genius writer, and the story is autobiographical;  the Traffic track is amazing.

 Excellent choice and superb post! 
























 I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; TGIF all over the SD world and in Cleveland! 




 You are a DINO!   




 Congratulations!

 Ha!  Great dream. Alison Krauss had been in more than a few of my dreams over the years.  [The Lucky One](https://youtu.be/jcRZ_J_VgNc) 




 Congratulations on your 6 months! 




 Welcome /u/ReadyTOgetBETTER -- I hope you'll take the time to [read through the Baby Steps post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which lays out what I did to stop drinking and to get sober for some ideas that might help you.

Good luck to you. 




 This is actually an excellent point. 




 Congratulations and welcome /u/jumpthejester to r/stopdrinking.  There are lots of servers, bartenders and one of my nearby sobernaughts is a brewmaster--so it can be done.  Let me offer you the [link to the Baby Steps post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which describes what I did to stop drinking and to get sober.  It might not be such a bad place to start stopping.  Good luck. 





























 Careful, corporate MBAs will come after you.

  Yet you had no problem voting for a Senator from Indiana that made promises

I have no idea what you're referring to, unless you are alluding to the Senator from Illinois, Barack Obama--in which case please cite to the specific job-growth numbers.   




 That would be smart, but you can see there are numerous logistical challenges which was my larger point.  How do food, beverage, and restaurant suppliers access the cafe?  Underground tunnels?  Who is going to patronize this cafe`?  Pedestrians or do the planners intend to shuttle suburbanites from nearby off-square parking lots?  The practicalities begin to seem problematic. 




 You are more than welcome.  You might also think about doing the morning check-in--usually one of the top posts on the sub.  The morning check-in adapted the first idea from the Baby Steps into a daily ritual. 




 Um, where are the dumpsters going to be kept? 




 Good for you! 




 Yeah, that sounds pretty dreadful. So did I share the [Baby Steps post with you in the past?](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) These things worked for me, and I too was in a pretty dark place.  Good luck turning this around.

P.S. Rock Bottom is only a metaphor, we can always dig deeper. 




 Welcome /u/throwaway78913080 to r/stopdrinking--I like to offer the [link to the Baby Steps post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which lays out some positive next steps to start stopping drinking.  These are the things I did and which I can honestly say still keep me sober today.

Good luck to you. 









 I don't think that's the issue, here.  The issue is the promises confidently made by this Governor who wants to be president and who got his cred by "disciplining public labor unions" as a pro-growth and pro-business political paradigm.  Typically, the rhetoric doesn't match the reality. 


































 Respectfully, this is ridiculous; CLIMATE change and the POPE's encyclical is explicitly about current US Politics and if you don't know this fact you aren't reading US Politics.  Once again, this is why it's on the Washington Post's POLITICS and OPINION pages. I could have take a dozen other articles about current GOP presidential campaigns dealing "explicitly" with this encyclical.  

 






















































 I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; I'm keeping Thursday SOBER in solidarity with the SD sobernauts all around the world. 




 Thank you, Mouse, I've had a really stressful run of tough days--nothing to compare to yours--nonetheless, this was a great reminder.  TODAY is the new day.  Let's do it SOBER.   




 I agree.

Also don't be put off by beginner meetings and meetings where there are a lot of DUIs.  Lots of us came through the door on paper.  When I came back from a long multi-year relapse I was on paper for 2 years, I was no less sincere about recovery. 




 Hey [I'm just an old chunk of coal](https://youtu.be/uwxYbb5uils?t=5s) but I'm gonna be a diamond some day

I'm gonna grow and glow till I'm so blue pure perfect

I'm gonna put a smile on everybody's face

I'm gonna kneel and pray every day last I should become vain along the way

I'm just an old chunk of coal now Lord but I'm gonna be a diamond some day


I'm gonna learn the best way to walk gonna search and find a better way to talk

I'm gonna spit and polish my old rough edged self till I get rid of every single flaw

I'm gonna be the world's best friend gonna go round shaking everybody's hand

I'm gonna be the cotton pickin' rage of the age I'm gonna be a diamond some day
 




 Welcome /u/Siryn to r/stopdrinking.  I frequently share the [Baby Steps post with our subreddit newcomers](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which is at that link and which lays out exactly how I stopped drinking and how I got sober.  I hope that there is something there that makes some sense for you as possible "next" easy things to do to start stopping.  Good luck to you. 




 I'm glad you chose to vent, here.  This place is a good outlet with tons of support and lots of participants with decades of sobriety.  

 




 Welcome /u/thecuriouswine--it sounds like you have a solid plan.  Best of luck. 




 Why not come clean with your wife that you are stopping drinking?  

Try doing this for yourself: I am not drinking TODAY, help me keep this commitment, because I can't do it alone. 




 Hail new centurion! 

It totally got easier for me at a 100 days; in fact, it sounds to me like you are on the verge of a significant breakthrough if you aren't already there.  Keep doing what you're doing. 



















 They almost always are. 




 This is a brilliant bit of advice; look for healthy new lifestyle reinforcers.  For me, personally, AA meetings and counseling helped enormously in the early days.    




 I am sure you're right.  Predators are predatory, they pick and choose victims opportunistically.  Remember during a significant part of that 15 years he was in prison for other crimes. 









 Does anyone else think this cafe design looks like a fancy shed? 









 When I was newly sober I was sitting in an AA meeting when someone said: It wasn't the 5th drink that sent me over the edge, it was the first.  Someone else interjected, It wasn't the caboose that killed him, it was the engine.   




 My late mother, God bless her--was NOT a good cook.  But her pineapple upside down cake made in a cast iron skillet was food of the Gods.  Yum, must make soon.   




 You really have come a long way; I am so proud of you.  Your presence on the sub has added real grace. 




 In prison, the Sally port was the secure and controlled entry point for pick ups and deliveries.  It's where inmates would report to before transit to or from off-institution appointments. 




 This.  

And always remember, your actions will speak louder than your words. 




 Welcome /u/_CalmBlueOcean_ to r/stopdrinking.  Yeah, that's pretty awesome that you had your "psychic shift" on the traditional day that Bill W. and Dr. Bob "founded AA."  So at this [link is the Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) post which is a description of the things I did to stop drinking and to get sober.  I hope something there is helpful to you as you move forward.  Good luck and I'll see you around. 




 Cleveland-Akron.   














 Goodbye asshole. 









 Yay, Shalee! 




 Best wishes to you /u/namastesober! 









 You know what this means, right?  Blumenthal HURT the cause of his GOP interrogators. 














 I think this poor mortified woman made a spectacular mistake, but the press really gave her the Scarlet Letter.  I think they went too far.   But I agree, she's not watching my children. 




 A *down* escalator. 



















  I've gotta remember I am just not someone who can drink. I really really just can't.

I would turn this around, it's not about what I "can't do" (being an alcoholic a "can't do" is usually just a challenge "to do something I shouldn't); nope, what I CHOOSE to do is not drink TODAY, only.  I don't 'quit drinking" instead I make a renewable daily decision not to drink TODAY, only, no matter what happens good or bad.   




 Congrats on 6 months! 




 Hail new Centurion!  Keep doing what you're doing! 




 Congratulations, /u/vinylsquares!  I'm really happy for your progress. 









 He's already indicated that it should be Oprah. 









 VERY GOOD POINT, but here's the thing--in 2016 we are on the precipice of electing the next person to nominate judges and Justices to life positions on the federal court.   














 As Jon Stewart said the speech was "the most beautifully ridiculous jibber-jabber ever to pour from the mouth of a batshit billionaire. 





































































 Last night, my alcoholic brain started convincing me to drink and that death is a good reason to drink. That is when I knew I was in the danger zone today.

The alkie brain is a big fucking liar.  

I'd cling to AA meetings and my support network.  I'd jump on the [SD Chat](http://is.gd/rsdirc) and get real time support.   




 Many of us are "double-winners:" alcoholic and al anon-qualified.  Don't hesitate to seek support for dealing with your Mom at /r/alanon as well. 




 At some point in my drinking career my only "friends" were guys who drank like me.  They reinforced my drinking.  When I made the decision to stop drinking I had to extinguish the old reinforcers.  I needed new friends, new venues, and new activities--that's what I got in recovery. 




 I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; here's to basements free of storm water and zombies.   




 Sweet! 









 Bummer on the root ball.

So what's the frame size on the Gitane?  Are you going full on 70s parts drilled brakes, chain ring?  This is my [Bianchi](http://i.imgur.com/ovovgk1.jpg)

 Here's what you're missing, the Bushes are supposed to be super-close to Bill and Hillary Clinton.  Personally dissing her is a surprise. 




 I have coffee every morning at 5:30 AM at Starbucks aka SBUX with my pal the retired journalist, filmmaker and PR guy, Chris who is a doppelganger for "the Dude" in the Big Lebowski.   




 I think we should call Jeb, "Hedge." 




 I also linked to the New York Times article, today, that had more context.
