 H2O2 is hydrogen peroxide. It is different than the chlorine dioxide (ClO2) being discussed here, particularly if your father is diluting it.

 I don't know if it is safe or effective though in COPD, although "The American Cancer Society states that "there is no scientific evidence that hydrogen peroxide is a safe, effective or useful cancer treatment"[53] The therapy is not approved by the U.S. FDA."   




 yea it's just horrible.  The b*stard that is selling the stuff claims on his site "... in one year since the first book was published more than 200,000 Americans are using The Miracle Mineral Solution (MMS)." "More than 10,000 bottles of MMS are being sold each month.

 I'm an 'old people' and I'm here. I do tend to put the bbc on too though. 




 yes, what all the parents did sucked plenty. But do you really want to subject 3 children to the foster care system? 

yes the PARENTS need to pay in some very large way.

 I just think it isn't always too difficult to find enough words in common, especially if she spoke Portuguese; if he was spending time in Newark it is not unlikely he would have picked up a bit of the language. Maybe they had a third language they both spoke pieces of??  His being white tells us nothing of his origin.             

Also the use of intoxicants, even just alcohol, may lead one to the belief that the long, soulful eyes thing is communication.

I once had a long and interesting ..conversation ..with some guy I met in Paris waiting for a train to Spain. I spoke no Spanish that week, he spoke no English. We managed to converse so well we actually argued as he thought that my asking where he was from was a racist question. Lol I know this sounds bizarre, but somehow we communicated.

 get out of my shower!  

(commented somewhere in here: Another one of my shower thoughts of late is that Russia   ISIS are aligned. I should shower less often, it's scary in there.) 




 those tweets reported there sound ominous. 
 "...Mukhin also tweeted two messages in relation with the issue. First: "Guys, you now need the president, come together." A few minutes later he added: "Be brave guys - Putin moved to the next level in your game..."

 




 Mar 11, 2015 4:26am EDT
  (Reuters) - Russia is ready to hold talks on a new agreement to control conventional arms in Europe, a Russian Foreign Ministry official said on Wednesday, after Russia announced the end of its participation in the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe.

"We are ready to look at the possibility and carry out corresponding talks on a new agreement which would adequately address new realities... and take into account the interests of the Russian Federation," Mikhail Ulyanov, director of the ministry's department on arms control, told the Interfax news agency. 




 Another one of my shower thoughts of late is that Russia   ISIS are aligned.

 Point was simple. 
A drug was mentioned above which was reported to be "amazing".

While I tend to believe most reading this particular thread have the sense to not simply run to the doctor   demand a prescription based on what an anonymous voice on the internet has told them, I thought it warranted mention that not every drug is compatible with every person's situation. 

Simple. 




 my point was simply to suggest that one may wish to occasionally check on whom is doing the editing.

 oh how I do understand that! I like to think of those dreams as ...well, sort of visits.  I am sorry you lost her, I know (hey I have mom rights I get to use!), she would have enjoyed that 'dream' at least as much, if not even more, than you did:) Try to hold onto the good stuff you experience, no matter where/when/how etc. Best to you /u/LittleFalls 3

 yes usually, I am often confused during the dream itself as well:)

But sometimes! those dreams are so wonderfully real. 




 What /u/jewelsteel said makes sense. 

I want to add though that I withdraw from people when things in my life get tough. It's just what I do. This could be loss of job, financial difficulties, almost anything particularly worrisome. 

I'm fairly pedestrian, so I'm betting there are plenty of others that do the same.

I think it is in fact that, as per u/jewelsteel, "But I NEED to put all of that attention in myself, to improve my mental health and make me happier."

http://www.reproductive-health-journal.com/content/8/1/26

 "According to the WHO classification of 1995 [10] used in this study designed in November 2008, FGM/C can be divided into four types:

Type I: Excision of the prepuce and part or all of the clitoris.

Type II: Excision of the prepuce and clitoris together with partial or total excision of the labia minora.

Type III: Infibulation. Excision of part or all of the external genitalia and stitching together of the two cut sides, to varying degrees.

Type IV: Pricking, piercing, incision, stretching, scraping, or other procedures harming the clitoris or labia, or both.

Types I, II and III of FGM/C present severe health consequences that have been well documented by several authors. The immediate health complications include shock, haemorrhage, infections and psychological consequences [11-13]. The long term health risks consist of chronic pain, infections, cheloids formation, primary infertility, birth complications, danger to the new born and psychological consequences [13-18]. Even FGM/C types I and II, sometimes considered as more innocuous, may involve severe health complications. For example, they have been reported to provoke unequivocal complications like shock, haemorrhage, urogenital complications [12], obstetric complications [18] and sexual dysfunction [15].

Despite the documented adverse effects of FGM/C, a recent review article states that its overall prevalence has declined very little [19]."

 oh did you mean Justinian's plague? sorry.  




 This paper seem to place the possible origin outside of china (http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Black-Death.pdf)

"Infection and migration
Spread of the black death in Europe. 
 The plague disease, generally thought to be caused by Yersinia pestis, is enzootic (commonly present) in populations of fleas carried by ground rodents, including marmots, in various areas including Central Asia, Kurdistan, Western Asia, Northern India and Uganda.[15] 
 
Nestorian graves dating to 1338-9 near Lake Issyk Kul in Kyrgizstan have inscriptions
referring to plague and recent investigations by the Russian archeologist Chwolson show a high incidence rate and are thought by many epidemiologists to mark the outbreak of the epidemic, from which they could easily have spread to China and India.[16] 

In October 2010, medical geneticists confirmed that the plague came from China.[4] In China, the 13th century Mongol conquest disrupted farming and trading, and led to widespread famine starting in 1331 with plague arriving soon after. The population dropped from approximately 120 to 60 million.[17] The 14th-century plague killed an estimated 25 million Chinese and other Asians during the 15 years before it entered Constantinople in 1347.[18]

The disease may have traveled along the Silk Road with Mongol armies and traders or it could have come via ship.[19] By the end of 1346 reports of plague had reached the seaports of Europe: "India was depopulated, Tartary, Mesopotamia, Syria, Armenia were covered with dead bodies".[20]

Plague was reportedly first introduced to Europe at the trading city of Caffa in the Crimea in 1347. After a protracted siege, during which the Mongol army under Jani Beg was suffering the disease, they catapulted the infected corpses over the city walls to infect the inhabitants. 

The Genoese traders fled, taking the plague by ship into Sicily and the south of Europe, whence it spread north.[21] Whether or not this hypothesis is accurate, it is clear that several existing conditions such as war, famine, and weather contributed to the severity of the Black Death."

 no, and I do not generally purposely break the rules; I truly apologize to you   the rest of the mod team.  Thank you,   to you all for your most excellent moderation,   again my apologies.

 tell them it is a 'bring your own mattress' party though. 




 While I agree that this does seem a hoax post, I think your presumption that a 70 yo will be unable to understand what trees is after 1 day on reddit is mistaken.

I am not quite 70 (yet) but got off the defaults on ..think it was the 2nd day on site. I stumbled on trees (which I am not subbed to) in some roundabout way ( I do sub to /r/marijuanaenthusiasts though so maybe I was looking up an actual tree? lol idk).

70 years olds   those near/aapprox that age are often active on many sites, so the lingo thing is moot. I know a few personally.

Ageism is so unattractive. 




 "One girl said: "I turned up at the police station at 2/3am, blood all over me, soaked through my trousers to the crotch. They dismissed it as me being naughty, a nuisance."

Another told the authorities: "The Asian men felt they ran Oxford. That was exciting. People were afraid of them. I felt protected. People respected them."

Fear is not respect. Subjugating young girls may be the theory that these geniuses have developed to aid the acceptance of certain facets of a culture; these facets have no place in western societies.

 Remember when you were a child, and were told   thus believed that 'you can be anything you want to be, if you are willing to do the work' ?

Well lots of folk are 1. Not told that.  2.Not getting the education required to move on to a position of hope; neither at home nor through public education. 3. Do not innately possess, nor have it nurtured in them, the inner fire required to succeed against all odds. 

I can go on   on.  Truth is we can (almost) all survive in the wild were we not to cave in to despair, and were we to think.  Would help if one's parent(s) took one out for a walk in nature now   then, or had the sanity to think of their child(ren) as just that and not a buddy nor an albatross, and spent a lil time actually teaching them the silly things their parents taught them, and the ones before as well.  Oh gee I seem to be going on   on despite myself.

You seem to have great pride in your own accomplishments, as well you certainly should.  You were lucky as well:)  Just keep in mind please, b4 u put down the rest of us for not being as sucessfull as yourself in this world, that From those to whom much is given, much is expected..

Edit!  I am not at all in favour of teenagers   younger , nor for the record even 20-somethings, fighting our wars, or anyone else's wars. I sort of think I would rather put myself on the line than the young people I love.
