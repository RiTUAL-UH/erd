 Well, those shelves have all the SF teen dystopian fiction like Hunger Games and Divergent, right? Basically just YA fiction has taken over shelf space.  




 Right? 

The other thing funny about these articles is they get written for every genre. "SF has triumphed!" "Superhero comics have triumphed!" "Crime thriller have triumphed!" 

Okay, guys, everything is winning! 




 What I posted in the r/books thread: 

 I like ASOIAF and a lot of other things mentioned here, but honestly this feels like an article that's written every 5 years. "Is Game of Thrones the triumph of fantasy?" "Is Harry Potter the triumph of fantasy?" "Is Peter Jackson's LOTR the triumph of fantasy?" "Is Terry Pratchett being the best-selling UK author in the 90s the triumph of fantasy?" etc.

 Basically, there's always one or two fantasy books/TV shows/films that break out into the mainstream every couple years. That's been true for a loooong time. But the genre itself never provides a lot of popular products at the same time.

 I even specifically remember a lot of "Fantasy has taken over YA for good!" articles during Harry Potter/His Dark Materials, but then like 5 years later it was all dystopian SF (Hunger Games/Divergent/etc.) and now it's dominated by sappy realism ala John Green and Rainbow Rowell. Basically, cycles move quickly.

Fantasy has been considered pretty legitimate for a while now in the literary world. Not sure there is much new in 2015 other than one popular TV show.  




 because he writes so quickly and doesn't spend that much time editing them. I like him (see username), but, yeah. You publish 1-2 books a year, they are going to be more hit or miss than a writer who spends 5-10 years on every novel.  




 This is a really common question here, but honestly ideas are a dime a dozen. It's the execution that always is the hardest and what counts the most.

 Yes, it's nonsense. The problems with all of these articles is that the numbers are just basically made up, because the actual numbers are all over the map. Trad publishing debuts can range anywhere from a mere 3k to 2 million in advances (there was a literary debut novel that got 2 million a couple years ago). Self-publishing authors mostly earn zero dollars, but those who do earn can range from 1 dollar a month to, who knows, 400k a month. 

Without knowing the work itself or the market you are looking at, there's no way to know what your potential money will be. 

 














 Oh sorry it didn't come up in search, must have been submitted with stuff on the end of the actual link 














 haha. Maybe the "walkers" refers to those things old people use 




 That all makes sense, but winter is coming was just my shorthand for how much winter and the white walkers are hyped up as the major threat (and I think they still will be in books 6/7) yet take forever to happen. 

It's not just the starks saying it. The first books have everyone talking about needing to prepare for winter, get grain stored away, etc.  




 I mean honestly, I haven't read enough of all three to make a big case here. Only 2-3 books from each.  









 Of those two, Dostoevsky because he is more dark and existential (but Gogol over both) 




 Right? I mean, are you telling me Italo Calvino and George Saunders aren't cool, entertaining, and fun to read?  




 Dunno, seems self-publishers are almost all reliant on Amazon which has been known to change terms and restructure algorithims at the drop of a hate. Didn't they slash royalty rates on audiobooks recently with basically no notice?  




 All I'm saying is that Book 1 made it seem like winter (and white walkers) would be the main battle the characters would face over the series. Instead, it's barely even talked about until the ends of books 4/5. Just kind of funny, not a big criticism. It's like if LOTR started out talking about Sauron and the rings then forgot about both until halfway through Return of the King 




 ***SPOILER ALERT***

haha come on, the winter of snow piling up hundreds of feet, everyone being locked down, the white walkers finally coming.... none of that has happened yet. 

And even the stuff you are talking about only happens at the VERY end of the 4/5 simultaneous books.  









 Something like a million books get self-published each year, but only a few thousand novels get published through actual presses. So, yeah, odds are most people calling themselves authors are just selfpublished.  




 If you don't think that there are lots of entertaining books with cool stuff in them shelved in literary fiction, and lots of wanky bullshit in the genre sections, you just haven't read many books.  














 ** SPOILER ALERT ***

lol right but that means we won't actually see any real winter until book 6. Book 5 is still people preparing for it.  




 Kind of like when Martin told us "Winter is coming!" in book 1 then, lol, April Fools, it doesn't even happen until book 6... maybe! 
























 Well, by that logic nothing should ever cost anything since some things are free. Youtube and so on are supported in part by ads though. 


 To me it just feels as if the pricing of audiobooks (and also books to a certain extent) is stuck in some kind of premium category of entertainment, while it today with everything being digital it is not really different from any other form of entertainment.

People say this on here a lot but I don't understand it. Books operate basically the exact same as other mediusm as far as I can tell. 

* You have Netflix for movies, and you have Oyster for books at same price. 

* You can pay 20 something for a DVD of a film or 15 for a CD of music and you can pay 15 or so for a paper book (more for fancy hardcover). 

* You can get a digital DVD/CD/ebook for a few bucks cheaper than the physical version. 

* You can watch some limited content free on YouTube, and there is tons of free fiction on web journals. 

All that said, an audiobook subscription service seems like a good idea. An audio counterpart to Netflix/Hulu/Oyster makes sense to me.  




 Are you saying you read 90% of the book, but not the last chapter?  




  also more expensive than going and seeing a movie.

huh? Most movies are 2 hours and most movie tickets cost more than 8 bucks. Also, most audiobooks are more like $2 an hour, and movie tickets are waaaaaay more than $4 bucks at least where I live.  




 $4 an hour is really cheap for entertainment. Movie tickets cost more than that. Concert tickets cost way more. A professional sporting event costs way way more. 

As to why it costs more than a paperbook.... not sure. Probably because the voice actor has to be paid too.  




 Goodreads. Amazon tends to have ever few reviews, unless the book is very famous, and has more scam and fake reviews. 

But I read professional book reviews over either.  









 I think the first 70 pages or so are easily the hardest part of IJ. If you push through, it gets easier to read. The book is intentionally confusing at first (it starts at the chronological end of the narrative)

But if you don't like it, no reason to force yourself to read.  














 Impressed that you read every one! 

(I'd rank Marlon James and VaderMeer much higher personally) 



















 Depends what you mean by "common." Mandarin has the most speakers by total number, but you'd be far more likely to run into an English speaker in most countries in the world. All of the Mandarin speakers are concentrated in China and a couple neighboring countries, while English is the primary or secondary language of a huge number of countries and more or less the "global language" still.  




 You should read everything in the language it was written in if you have the choice... meaning if you speak that language. 

Otherwise read in the language you are most comfortable with.  














 Ideas, in books, come in the form of words. Changing words absolutely changes the meaning of ideas.  




 My point is that it's very easy to believe that people will make apps that do more than just censor a few curse words.  




 I can think of a couple recent mainstream adult novels that were anthropomorphic

* The Bees by Laline Paull (came out last year, about, well, bees)

* Albert of Adelaide by Howard L. Anderson (2012, about Australian animals)

I haven't read either so can't comment on the quality, but both were literary fiction published by big houses. Clearly an anthropomorphic novel CAN be sold. (As others note, it's even more common to find SF/F books with anthropomorphism.) I'm sure it is harder to sell, but on the other hand there are less people doing them
 




   More importantly, Clean Reader can censor words, but it can't censor ideas.

Why on earth do you think that future apps won't do this? 

There were news stories about a woman who rewrote Harry Potter to be about Christianity instead of wizards and witches, removing all the "evil" witchcraft. 

I could easily see future apps being designed to filter out ideas or to cut out portions of a novel that the app makers don't like. Say, The Jungle, which ends with a pro-socialist message. Surely some conservative would be down to read that book with the ending cut off, and a future app might oblige him.  




 Great book! 
























 Even if he isn't comparing his exact work, he's saying the style of writing he prefers is superior to another style 




 Except this is one writer saying his style of writing is better than another writers.  




 I would say the hallmark of bad writing is being boring. Most of the other stuff people say isn't true. By which I mean, there are great books without round characters, great books without plots, great books that are heavily stylized and/or with very little style, yada yada. Any of that kind of thing can be done as long as the work is interesting. 

A hallmark of mediocore writing is that it's not memorable, to me at least. So a book that's interesting superficially while reading, but which you never think about again isn't really "good" writing in my book. (for me most "airport fiction" / beach read books fall into that category).  




  My idea is "simple": after an author dies his books must be given for free in digital editions, while the physical copies must be sold at a price that covers the costs of the production, plus an income for the editors and all the work that is behind it. 

Isn't this basically how things already work except instead of "right at death" it happens after copyright runs out. Once that happens, Gutenberg and other places give it out for free digitally and cheap paperback companies like Dover Thrift sell paper books for like 1-3 bucks. 

Basically you just want a shorter copyright? 

 digital distribution doesn't have costs.. 

This really isn't true. But again, once copyright is finished places like Project Gutenberg make free digital copies.

 I'd like to know if my idea is in some way feasible

A post on reddit isn't going to change international copyright laws  




 While James Joyce is vastly superior to Coelho so... 














 I'm not sure what to think of this, a lot depends on if the company HELPS you crowdfund. 

Meaning, do they have a dedicated base of users who you wouldn't have access to otherwise? Or are they bascially asking you to do your own kickstarter and then saying they will take a cut if it works?  




 Unless you only read books by Stephen King and JK Rowling, most of the authors you read are probably not making much money. Most authors do not earn enough to live on from writing even if they are best selling authors. 

 i don't see how writing a book is any different from completing an album. 

I agree, but aren't most paperback books about the price of an album? And much cheaper than most concert tickets? 




 That's really rare though. Most ebooks from big publishers on amazon are between 4 and 8 bucks from what I've seen.

I agree that ebooks should be a few dollars cheaper than print books, but I think they basically always are. If the paper book cost less it's probably because Amazon or whatever site you were on discounted the paper book but not the ebook. 




  Wealthy people have such an advantage because they can afford to purchase all the new books that come out at full price.

There are more public domain books than you can read in a life

There are more free articles online than you can read in a life

There are libraries in every town with free books

 




 You dont have to be writing high art to not want it censored.

Question: would you be fine having your work with your name in it sold through an app that inserted racial epithets throughout? 




 Some people actually do have principles and beliefs and care about more than just sales 




 Okay, I didn't realize you were going off about DRM. A few things: 

- "authors" do NOT have the power to stop any shop selling their goods, unless they are self-publishers I guess. Authors sign contracts with publishers, who sign contracts with distributors, who sell to retailers. As I noted before, many authors wanted to pull books from Amazon during the recent Amazon fight but couldn't because they'd signed those rights away. 

- In general, I'm not a fan of DRM. But DRM is hardly unique to "authors." All digital products can, and frequently do, have DRM. Conversely, many publishers don't use DRM at all. 

 In other words, authors can stop their ebook from being sold by "White Power Books" for the same reason there is no such thing as a 'used ebook store'. 

Well, no. As I noted above, authors sign contracts. If you sign with a publisher who sells books to White Power Cafe or ebooks to WhitePowerCafe.com, you are shit out of luck really. All you can do is complain and ask for them to be pulled, but you can't legally make that happen.  




 Let me ask you: would you think authors would be wrong to complain about an app that inserted sexist or racist terms into their work? Would they be bullies for asking the app makers to not do that? 




  Would it be bullying if the service in question was, say, a same-sex dating app and the media firestorm was from the conservative press?

If someone developed an app that inserted Satanic references, gay marriage, and, what else do Christians hate these days?, global warming into Christian novels, and Christian authors got upset about it I would not say they were bullies. I mean, I think it would be pretty funny because gay marriage is cool and climate change is real, but conservative authors would be in their rights to say they don't want the app used on their books. 

 If you can change the names and none of the logic and up with a radically different conclusion, then maybe you should reconsider how honestly you've arrived at your opinions.

Haha, dude, whatever our disagreements here, your "change the names" example was COMPLETELY unrelated. Here Christian conservatives are attempting to change the words of artists and the artists are upset. That has nothing to do with a same-sex dating app that Christians hate because they are homophobic. 

No author is saying that all books should have profanity! No one is saying that Christian books shouldn't be allowed to exist! 




 It seems like you have a problem with words, because this is not "bullying" and these people are not "victims."  




 Who is calling for new regulations? 

Why do these threads always turn into silly straw men arguments? 

There are plenty of things that are within someone's legal rights that they rightly get criticized for. What it really seems like is that people like you think that everyone should shut up and never ever speak out against racism, sexism, censorship, or anything else.  




 All the whining about "reader's rights to their property" is so absurd in this case to me. 

Look, there are one million books published a year. There is a near infinite back catalog of books published in human history. You don't like a book because of the language? Don't buy it! Buy any of the millions of books that don't use those words. You're "rights" are not being infringed that a book exists with words you don't like! 

This simply isn't a problem that needs fixing! Go read a different book. Jebus.  




  The fact is that bread companies don't have the power to stop any shop from selling their goods. This is because bread companies don't have monopoly rights on their bread.

What on earth are you talking about? 

A bread company absolutely has the same rights as an author/publisher. They can enter into contracts with retail shops, or they can not. 

I seriously don't understand what you think is going on with books? What's different? 

p.s. authors do NOT have the power to stop any shop from selling their goods, they have to honor the contracts they enter into. Many authors wanted to pull books from Amazon but couldn't because they signed contracts, for example.) 

 You would be a monopolist if you had the power to stop "White Power Cafe", but because you don't have that power you aren't a monopolist.

Again, authors do NOT have that power. Even in this case, it was authors complaining that got the Clean App to take them off. They didn't legally force the app to stop it. IF there was a legal basis for it to be stopped, it would be on some intellecutal property grounds that would apply to other goods as well!

You seem to be very confused about the situation here.  




 If you have legitimate reasons to not read a book--such as actual PTSD, which is a real thing not just "feeling icky" at curse words--then you teacher will almost certainly give you some alternative. Teachers are normally pretty sensitive to that kind of thing. 

if you don't actually have any real pyschological need to avoid a book, but just don't want to see words like "penis" or "piss" then your teacher will likely roll their eyes at you. 

Again, I don't see what this has to do with Clean Reader. Trigger warnings are for things that can trigger PTSD. This app does not scrub out rape scenes or violent war scenes. It just changes curse words and some body part terms.  




  But as another redditor mentioned, what would happen if you do have a serious psychological issue that multiple psychologists/psychiatrists/etc have proven, should you still be forced to read it?

The issue here is with a teacher FORCING you to read the book, not with the author writing the scene. 

I think trigger warnings and what literature can or should be taught in school is an interesting question, but it really doesn't have anything to do with this app (unless you are suggesting that seeing the word "piss" instead of "pee" could cause serious psychological damage...) 




  Authors demanding "My book, my rules, and that includes my words. ALL of them." is no different than any monopolist making outrageous demands for using their service, because they have the power to do so

Sorry it's... totally fucking different on every single level. 

First off, this app sold ebooks through it. So authors wanted their books pulled from a store that was promoting religious censorship. 

Are you telling me that if I sold muffins and didn't want my muffins sold at a White Power cafe, that'd be a "monopolist"? 

Or if I was a rubber band maker and asked for my rubber bands not to be sold through a openly anti-gay office supply company that it would be "horrid" of me? 

Really? If I make rubber bands and don't want a company to stamp "fuck [some racial group" on them and sell them, then I can't tell them not to use my rubber bands without being some evil, "horrid" monopolist? I have a hard time believing you really think this. 
 




 But authors have the right to not sell their work through an app that censors it. So it's different than the sharpie. It's more like authors demanding their books be pulled from a Nazi bookstore.  
























 Well, I disagree. Not that Martin can't do that, but that having "rules" actually changes anything. Plenty of books with strict magic "rules" still find plenty of ways to have cheap plot twists, overly powerful spells, or other such things.  




 I'm not sure how you are using deus ex machina. The term, as I understand it, is, to quote wikipedia, 

 "a plot device whereby a seemingly unsolvable problem is suddenly and abruptly resolved by the contrived and unexpected intervention of some new event, character, ability or object. "

Stoneheart is unexpected, surely, but she doesn't solve a problem. It's not like Ned Stark is the hero of ASOIAF and just when you think he can't possibly survive, Stoneheart revives and saves his life. She's just a weird character and plot twist, but she isn't a deus ex machina. (Hell, so far she barely even impacts the plot at all. Just kills a bunch of no-names) 




 Anything, or at least any magic system, can be used as a deus ex machina. (Rowling, or whoever, can easily just have Dumbledore cast some crazy spell, or if she decides a plot point needs a certain kind of spell can just write in a silly scene where that spell is mentioned earlier. There's just as much freedom there.)

But where do you think Martin uses it that way?  




 Honestly, ASOIAF. 

I like 

A) that it's mysterious and not spelled out as bluntly as most books

B) involves sacrifice. Almost all the magic seems to be some from of "blood magic" where people have to die or at least get injured for spells to work. 

C) Competing (i.e., ice magic, fire magic, warging, etc. all seem to come from different groups and different religions)

D) Rare.  









 But let's be clear. "Viewed" here means how it can be sold and read, not the "interpretation" or "meaning." 

I'd say it was fucked up if a book store cut a novel in half and only sold half the novel to people. Maybe you DGAF if the author wants the novel sold in full, but I side with the author there.  




 You are correct. There is zero "fault" with an author not wanting their book rewritten by dumb parents. Quit literally zero.  




 Oh please, the only thing slapping anyone in the face are idiotic christians thinking it's their job to censor novels 




 Not really, because this app promotes itself for children, basically it's for parents to censor their kid's reading 




 I'm not advocating for DRM, but you can still respect an author's work without there being a law or DRM to enforce it. 

Buuuut you pay for a book, physical or e, not a word doc. And this isn't a user going through and blacking out words in their personal copy, it's more like a company that sells books in a way that authors don't consent to.  




 I've increasingly found no use for my e-reader. I prefer paper for a dozen reasons, but I'm happy to e-read... however, I have an Oyster app on my phone that's much more convenient than lugging a Kindle around. Then when I'm at home, I have paper books. 

Just no use for a Kindle except really long trips I guess.  














 Very much agree with this. Authorial consent matters. And this extends to shit like pirating people's books without permission.  




 Thanks! I try, I thought this one was good and adjuncting is a big issue especially for writers 



















 Ideas are a dime a dozen. Execution is all that counts.  




 She is one of the best short storie writers ever in my opinion 














 I would say: best idea!

 




 Yeah, it just becomes a really narrow echo-chamber kind of thing from what I've seen. 

I do use Goodreads to track my own books, but I don't review or share or comment.  




 Yeah I think it's a bad trend, at least for me. I also think it makes everyone read the same things. You want to be "in on the conversation" so everyone buys the same books and has the same opinions... 









 Also, EVERY single editor and agent who has worked in the industry for any amount of time has passed over a ton of books that ended up doing well. That's the nature of the game. 

Granted, Harry Potter is an exceptionally huge miss, but you are going to have a lot of them.  



















  I know a few people who are making serious money as self-published authors (I'm talking more than $500,000 each year)

You know three or more people who are raking in a half million a year? 

That would put you well into the top 1% 




 I totally believe he know the general endgame of book 7 from the start BUT over the course of the expanding series he's introduced all these new people and given then major narrative weight (Euron, Vicatarion, all the Dorne people, etc.) and he'll have to have them all do something. They can't all just die suddenly without impacting the plot really.  









 Most writers do NOT plan everything out. 

Or at least, most literary writers don't. Genre writers are more prone to developing detailed plot outlines.  




  "Of the top 7000 best-selling books, indie books have higher average review scores than the traditionally published suggesting quality is not a significant problem for indies."

lol lol

Look, no one in the industry takes the Author Earnings seriously. They fail basic statistics. 

But the above is really comical because fake reviews, purchased reviews, and scam reviews are RAMPANT in the self-publishing world. Of course they get hire reviews when the the reviews are all from friends, family, or people they paid to review! 

Beyond that, people who "review" a free or 99 cent ebook hold it to a lower standard than a 25 dollar hardcover. It's fair of them to do so, since they are paying way less, but they aren't reviewing the same thing in that case. 

 Also, I'll point out that the trads publish their share of crap (Twilight, 50 shades etc...)

You know that 50 Shades was self-published as fan-fiction first?  




 Everything I've read has been uniformly awful. I'm sure there is SOME good self-published work out there. I can even think of one--but only one--book that started self-published then was lauded as a traditionally published book: The Martian. (There was also Hugh Howey, but everyone I know who has read Wool says it's mediocre and not worth reading, and 50 Shades of Grey, which is considered one of the poorest written books ever published.)

But yes, of course it is low compared to traditional, for a very simple reason: numbers. 

There are something like ONE MILLION self-published books each year. Some of those are by bots and such, but the point is that there are vastly more self-published books than traditionally published books. Even if you believed there were as many good novels self-published as traditionally published, the self-published "good" ones are buried under an entire mountain of horrible ones. And there is no reliable way to find them, since the review system is a total scam with people purchasing reviews, leaving negative reviews on rivals, and begging their friends and family to review.  




 Yes this kind of thing is depressing. It's bad enough that popularity matters more than talent, but it's even worse when it's just popularity in any medium that gets you a book deal. Getting film rigths to a film series is one thing, but given the person a book deal who hasn't written a book?  




 I noted marketing! Agree though 









 He's certainly right, but that's small comfort for us now 




 It's not just your average novel though. Lots of best sellers and awardwinners had some rejections, often way more than Rowling. 

 That's why it's a big deal. In a rational, fair world, where author skill is linked to ease of getting published, you'd expect the most popular books to be identified as such from the people whose job it is to find them.

I think you make a big mistake equating "author skill" with "most popular books"! 




 I'm ready for these distinctions to die. In the past, all this stuff was separated. But now everyone readers and watches everything. You can't exist in 2015 America without watching/reading SOME fantasy (GOT/Harry Potter/LOTRetc.), science fiction (Star Wars, Star Trek, BSG), some superhero stuff (Marvel films, whatever). yada yada. 

We all read and watch it all today.  









 I'm with you! I don't think Harry Potter was pure luck. She writes pretty well and mostly the books are SMART, but which I mean they combine popular genres and they came out at a time when there weren't many big fantasy YA books or children's books. So smartly done.  




  But a shit ton of people liked it anyway.

Well one thing we should do is separate "sold" from "liked." 50 Shades became a big phenom, which means tons of people bought it just to hate read it or because it was famous and then didn't like it. 

But yes some people like it. I guess I don't think it follows that the book "did something" for those people in any real way. Or at least, I think there are 10,000 other books that could have done the exact same thing for those people. That 50 Shades became a mega hit and not the thousands of similar erotica novels is, to my mind, really just luck and marketing. It doesn't say anything about the quality of the work on any level. 

 Even if you, in your refined book taste, does not see it.

I don't think it has anything to do with refinery FWIW. I just think we should acknowledge that much of what gets popular has to do with luck, marketing, and other factors that don't relate to the work itself. I also think that fame is all about snowballing. Once something starts getting famous, it gets more and more that way. That's true of even high brow literature (say the Goldfinch the other year). Also true of films, restaurants, and a million other things. That's all. 
 




  And there's where she should totally get some real credit: World-Building

Really? I normally see even big fantasy and HP fans ding her for her lazy world building. Like even the basics of the world make no sense: there's the greatest villain ever in England, and there are magic schools and wizards all over the world yet... none of them come help? They aren't involved at all except for a silly school tournament? 

I agree with you that she deploys the tropes well. Like I said, they are fine books and way better than other mega sellers like Twilight/50 Shades/Divergent.  




  If she was such a mediocre writer, the series would've died before it was finished.

50 Shades of Gray is the best selling book around and the author literally can't write basic sentences that even make sense. (Google "worst 50 Shades sentences" if you want to see and cringe.) 

Rowling is WAAAAAY better than EL James. But a book selling really well truly isn't any measure of quality. In fact, shitty books are more likely to sell well. And mediocre writers finish bad series all the time. Hell, there are probably literally thousands of self-published novel series on Amazon that haven't even sold 100 copies. 

 The book has to have done at least one thing really well so it resonates with people.

What do you make of the fact, posted below, that Rowling's pen name novel was selling horribly until it leaked that she was the author, then it shot up to #1? Was the book not doing anything well at first then magically started doing things well without being rewritten?  




 Sure, of course it took thought/care/skill to create. They are fine books. But they are also highly formulaic and use very overused formulas. The orphan hero who learns he has a magical destiny is like THE classic hero journey trope. And /r/books sometimes has threads where people marvel at Rowling's creatures, not realizing they are almost all classic myth/fantasy creatures who've existed in a thousand other books. 

But hey, there's a reason they are formulas: they work. Most blockbuster films and bestselling books adhere to well-worn formulas. There's a reason, too, that Hollywood reboots the same characters and franchises over and over. It works and it sells.  




  because the entertainment industry isn't about producing quality work - it's about fame and power.

Well it's a business, but I think writers make a mistake blaming the industry. The problem is really readers. As you note, readers only buy books from names they know: 

 If I remember, her pen-name book was 5,000th on the best-sellers list. Until it was leaked that she authored it - then it jumped right up to number 1 for weeks on end.

If readers cared about emerging writers or unknown names, we'd all do better.  




  They're just hyped and got popular so we all love them.

The thing people forget in these conversations is that luck plays a huge factor here. There were probably dozens of books as good as, say, Twilight or Divergent even coving the same subject matters... (probably 10,000 books in the case of 50 shades) but they didn't catch on because of timing/luck/lack of marketing/ and whatever else. 

Point being, an agent is only "stupid" for passing on those books in retrospect. 9 times out of 10, Divergent would probably be a flop.  




 Harry Potter is not all that well written. It's not even very original, it just combined two highly popular British genres (high fantasy and the boarding school novel) and caught on.

But it's better than Twilight, Divergent, 50 Shades, and most of the other mega sellers that came after. They aren't great books, but they were smartly marketed and came out in a great time without much competition.  




 Agreed that isn't much rejection at all. 

Imagine if you were a NBA player drafted 12th. "No teams wanted me!" Uh... not really.  









 It's for the full body of work, but there are several names there who are among the most famous international authors.  




  and at present none of the top contenders for being the Magic-Zoroastrian warrior-messiah are in a position of power,

This is just classic Hero's journey trope stuff though. The great prince/princess always falls farthest (Snow being killed by his own men, Dany having her empire crumble and ending up in the dessert) before they rise to glory. I feel pretty confident that one or both of them will be the Azhor Azai and save everyone 




 Totally agree. The world is overpopulated and there are tons of kids who need adoptions around the world. Having a kid is pretty selfish when looking at those facts. You really need to have YOUR genes propagated in a planet of 7 billion? 

I don't look down on people who have kids mind you. But I definitely think that if one of those routes is selfish, it's having kids not deciding not to.  




 From the NY Times. 

 Marcel Proust never had a job.

 Emily Dickinson never had a job.

 Gustave Flaubert, Sartre believed, exaggerated or fabricated an epileptic condition so as to get out of law school and instead move back in with his mother.

 Vladimir Nabokov was born into vast wealth, lost most everything, eventually landed a teaching position at one university and then another, wrote arguably his best works during that time, and later retired to Montreux, Switzerland. His wife, Vra, by his account, served him as a secretary, typist, chauffeur, teaching assistant, research assistant ... and so on. 
























 Well, I don't think he'll reconcile everyone! I imagine Euron and Littlefinger will play chaos spoilers and have to be killed. And I bet the whole thing will end with an uneasy peace. 

But I bet that Dany and Jon will unite, joining the wildlings, the north, and Dany's army and dragons to fight the walkers. Dorne will probably join them (after Aegon gets defeated). Stannis will joing. 

Lannisters are already a spent force. As I said, Iron Islanders and Littlefinger (with the Vale?) will cause trouble. Aegon will have to be defeated. It won't be some easy happy thing! 
























 Oh, I think Davis is totally deserving. But we seem on the same page this year.  




 Well, those four writers are from 3 different countries and 2 continents, but I agree would be nice to go to someone like Aira or Krasznahorkai this year 




 I think you are confusing the Man Booker with the Man Booker International (they are two different prizes). The International prize was never restricted to the Commonwealth. The regular booker is now open to any book written in English, but the International prize has always been international.  




 Yeah I don't think she is named after the publisher, the publisher is named after something else.  




 US english: 

 "What do you mean, 'That's final?'" said Emma.

UK English: 

 'What do you mean, "That's final?"' said Emma.

 




 Yeah I can see that. But bookstores do have authors sign a big stack of copies everytime they do a reading so lots of signed copies floating around. (Store normally puts a sticker on it saying "signed copy" though) 


































 This seems like a trick question 









 Well, I'm not saying it's how I'd write it, but I'm saying that's what the narrative has built up. Winter is coming, Azhor Azhai prophecy, dragons (fire) vs. white walkers (ice), The Wall... so many of the huge elements of the book are about the Walkers. 

I think Martin's point WRT human treachery is that the "players" in the game of thrones are killing each other over fleeting glory and ignoring the true existential threat coming from the north.  




  As much as I agree that the Others will need to be addressed at some point, 

I don't think they will just be "addressed" I think they are the end game of the books. The others aren't just some random thing that's been mentioned, the narrative has totally  built them up as the central question. Consider: 

1) "Winter is coming" is like the most famous phrase in the book and we hear it from book one. The White Walkers bring winter. 

2) The Azhor Azhai prophecy is all about a hero saving humanity from the white walkers. Either Dany or Jon is AA reborn. 

3) The most magical and amazing element of westeros, the Wall, was built to keep out the others. 

4) The book is called A Song of Ice and Fire. Ice are the walkers, fire are the dragons (I guess). 

etc. 

Plus, Martin has said we are going to travel far north in book 6 so we'll learn a lot about them. 

 If Martin doesn't flake out and make the Others vanish entirely, then I suspect the show won't make them much more than a damp squib. 

I think you are totally wrong. I'd place money on the walkers being THE major baddies (from humanity's POV) who invade a Westeros weakend by war and are only stopped by Dany and her dragons, as well as the kingdoms uniting together. 

This doesn't mean we'll have a happy ending. Dany will probably die saving westeros, but still.  




 Yeah but the outline was very different from what happened in the books, so... 




 I like Martin, but he seemed to be kind of scrambling in the last few books and introducing all these plots lines and stories he never planned on doing. 

Now, before you say that I don't know what he had planned, remember that Martin himself has openingly admitted that: 

a) Books 4/5 weren't even supposed to exist. He was going to do a time jump for book 4 but couldn't make it work so wrote two entirely unplanned books. 

b) Admitted he struggled for years to figure out the "meeranese knot" problem with Book 5

So Martin himself is pretty open about not fully having all this planned out and getting himself into trouble.  




 Fight Club also didn't come out in the age of Twitter and facebook. 

(although i disagree that GOT is building towards who is king. It's building toward the White Walkers invading and humanity having to band together to survive)
 




 Seriously, this stuff can't be avoided at this point.  




 You've got more faith than me. Books 4 and 5 introduce a ton of plot lines that I think will take him a lot of effort and time to clear up. 

People say "oh, he can just kill everyone!' But the problem is that lots of characters have been set up as major movers and shakers and they will all have to do something meaningful before the end: Varys, Littlefinger, Bran, Dany, Jon Snow, Arya, Euron, etc. etc. 

We'll see though! 




 Yeah she's totally boring in the books. Would be easy to cut.  




 It's common for bookstores to get authors to sign copies of the books when they come to read, including Barnes and Noble. So, yes, it probably was a promotional thing at B+N. 

I've never heard of an author randomlly signing books. Not sure what that would even mean. The books are printed in one city, shipped to distributor in another, and then sent to various bookstores. They don't pass through the author's hands. 

I guess an author could go randomlly sign copies in bookstores they enter to amuse themselves though.  









 Yes, the only way I could see them working is by having them each be like 500,000 words, so "technically" 2 books but the length of 5 normal books. 

(The last ASOIAF book was over 400,000)  




 The first three books are the best, so might as well start there. But if you just want to know the plot or something, start with book 4.  




 lol 









 Well the books are best sellers so they are a cultural phenomenon too. I see people reading them all the time. Sure the show is more popular, but that doesn't necessarily mean the books can't be the definite version. For example, I'm sure more people have watched Harry Potter than read the whole series, but the books are probably still the "real" version. Ditto Lord of the Rings. 

But Game of Thrones... if the show ends the plot it will probably go down as the real version.  




 Honestly, I can't imagine how he can tie up all the plot lines in only two books 









 I thought that HBO said they wanted more BUT would respect the showrunners wishes. (Of course HBO wants more, its popular and makes them money!) 

But look, let's say GRRM somehow gets The Winds of Winter out by spring of next year, right as season 6 starts. That means he only as a year to get a book out before season 7... but even if they go 8 or 9 seasons he'd only have 2-3 years to write the book. He doesn't seem capable of doing that at this point.  














  onto a path that seems to make stuff gory because it generates PR, it seems.

Odd... I feel the show has gotten LESS gory and LESS sex-filled as it's gone on.. to it's benefit too.  




 I do wonder if the show will end up being the definitive version for the culture at large. Pretty strange to think about that happening, but it isn't totally unheard of (e.g., The Godfather film is THE Godfather, not the novel.) 









 Yeah but the early books are always easier in a series. Tying up all the loose ends (especially when Martin keeps adding subplots!) takes more time, I think.
