 we could just power them from the energy from those solar panels. Power enough for one planet vs one solar system, it should be more than enough. 



















 Hey don't look at me, I'm just an accountant. 




 It's actually incredibly logical. It's one of the most efficient ways to permanently harness power from a solar entity, and would permit a civilization to gradually scale its economic investment with its power needs. For instance, a younger spacefaring civilization would probably only require a Dyson ring, whereas a mature one would probably have a complete sphere which almost completely envelops the star, save for sustainability requirements. It also has the advantage of drawing power from the star without actually interfering with it and possibly invoking supernova, such as with a fusion solution.  









 This is actually one existing concept of the multiverse. To summarize, Einstein discovered that there is actually no such thing as "distance" or "time" as independent concepts, it's actually one cohesive unit of measure known as "space-time". It's only when viewed from insignificant dimensions like ours that space and time have distinct characteristics. This space-time is considered to be the subsequent 4th dimension to our existing 3 dimensions of point, length and height/width. 

The gravity characteristics of black holes exhibit the limits of space-time, which is why it is often portrayed in science fiction as portals into another dimension. It is posited that beyond such limits lie the entrance to a higher dimension, which some theorize as the multiverse, whether through black holes or not. 

Like you said, an entity existing in a lower dimension will be unable to observe an entity existing in a higher dimension, e.g. if you existed in the 2nd dimension you would only be able to see in a line (i.e. left and right), but not up or down (i.e. in the 3rd dimension); hence if I were above you you would not know I was there even if I were right next to you. Similarly, an entity with access to the 4th dimension could exist and interact with us in the 3rd dimension without our awareness. So an entity bearing the characteristics of "God" as defined by popular culture could very possibly be a being in a higher dimension, and it would still be internally consistent with our present theories of science.

 If they wanted to make money shorting it they could have just held it until the earnings were released properly. No need to draw more attention getting involved in this fancywhimgo.

 My breakeven for AAPL is 9% EPS growth into perpetuity. If you think it can exceed that then it's fairly priced. Having said that, to say it's undervalued is a bit of a stretch. There are other better opportunities out there. If you don't want to do any research and want a decent growth blue chip, AAPL is not bad. 




 You might think so because you haven't yet been a millionaire, but I'm afraid you might be a little naive. I have yet to meet a millionaire who was satisfied with his wealth.    The majority of millionaires who aren't already on their deathbeds or facing unrelated personal crises are actively trying to become billionaires. You'll feel the same way once you become one, trust me.  




 As much as any individual human being tries, he can only do so much. He may be an ant where others are mere atoms, but he is still an ant. Beyond that insignificant capacity, it's completely up to chance. 

If you take the time to study history, you will find that all great successes in history were at least 60% up to luck and chance. The disparity is explained by survivorship bias, where you only see the winners but not the losers. 




 It's because Buffett once said that a company's value is equal to its discounted cash flows over its lifetime. People then started harping on it without truly understanding its significance. 




 1. The identical CoC used as a growth rate simply means the CoC is growing at the CoC rate. It's purely arbitrary and just meant to reflect a non constant CoC in a simple way; doesn't really matter what growth rate is used.

2. ROIIC   ROIC has the same effect for the purpose of the table. You gotta look at the bigger picture of what the table is trying to convey, which is what you were first asking. 




 Ok.

 FCF shouldn't be taken as a hard and fast rule. It's more useful to consider the cash flows in arriving at the final FCF figure individually, and form your own opinion on the aggregate cash flows. Simply relying on the final FCF figure is not much better than simply relying on a final DCF figure. 









 I see, thanks!

 1. It's not plus, it's multiply. The 2nd CoC is just an assumption that cost of capital will grow at a constant rate over time. 

2. Yes, it's because of that. The idea is that earnings growth can be expressed as an average of a large one-time number, whereas ROIC can't be window-dressed. Hence, his example of a poor acquisition demonstrates that growth numbers alone are illusory and can hide deeper symptoms which ROIC picks out. 

It's a pretty good article, and is one of the best attempts I've seen to provide a theoretical explanation for P/E. However, it still doesn't provide a perfect practical solution to the real world. As far as I've gathered, P/E doesn't seem to be grounded in any fundamental principle, it's just a reflection of sentiment to the share. 




 I remember they were repulsed about it, it's one of the reasons why Ax is a combination of all of them rather than just one.  




  The Veggies as they were known were a peace loving extremely scientifically advanced race originating from the outer edges of the Polar Centauri galaxy, with one of their minor experiments of terracreation giving birth to the Ellimist's home world. When one of their species accidentally dropped a lab culture on the barren asteroid Seerowpedia during one of their holidays, the resultant exposure spawned the first ancestors of what we now recognize as the Yeerks.  




 Didn't they have some kind of ethics code against morphing into other humans? What was the exact reason again?

 For all intents and purposes it is riskless. Even in the most ideal arbitrage conditions you still face minute probabilities of catastrophic risk. The flip side is that the chance of it happening is so tiny that it makes the risk effectively negligible. 




 Considering how the iPhone makes up 70% of profits, and it has a whopping 40% net margin, the average is kinda tough to beat.

 You may not know this, but you cannot buy insurance for your pitchforks! Consider these scenarios:

* How many times have you waved your pitchforks in the air only to hit it against a signboard and have it break at the most critical time of the protest? 

* Mistaken for carrying lethal arms by law enforcement when holding a pitchfork?

* Shelled out-of-pocket for third party liability? 

Avoid all these problems and more with Plungers Protest! Shop smart today!!!
