 Well the point I'm trying to make is that people can't stand Congress but they like their representative. They don't seem to understand that their representative is part of the problem. Their local votes have a nationwide impact. 




 The most depressing statistic in the world: Congress has a 9 percent approval rating and yet 90 percent of incumbents were reelected in 2014.

America deserves the Congress it gets.

So much history and justifiable angst in seven words. 









 It reminds me of when Bush the old man went to a grocery store and marveled at the laser UPC system.
