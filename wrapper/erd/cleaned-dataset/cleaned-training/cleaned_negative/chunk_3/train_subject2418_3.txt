 Yeah but show the landing. They're all dead.

 Nice! How is it? My only problem is that Rip Van Winkle slept for 20 years. Do they have a 20 year?

 I had a followup interview for an in-store bank teller position. In-store meaning grocery store. The wonderfully flamboyant regional manager who was interviewing me said, "you'll need to leave the bank and entice shoppers to open accounts..." I told him that was fine. 
He continued, "you'll need to talk to them while they're shopping..." he stopped walking when we reached the salad dressing isle.
 
"What kind of salad dressing are you?" 
I realized this was not only a really goofy interview question, it was role-playing a big portion of the job I was after.

I grabbed Raspberry Vinaigrette and improv'd a bit about having a tangy and fun personality. He grabbed Cesar and said, "I'm more of a Cesar!" and he stabbed me in the back with the bottle. 

In retrospect, I think his joke would have been funnier if the salad dressing we called 'Brutus' 

I got the job.

 Yeah! Paintings show him in a jar, a tub... He also walked around in broad daylight holding a lamp; searching for an honest man.
