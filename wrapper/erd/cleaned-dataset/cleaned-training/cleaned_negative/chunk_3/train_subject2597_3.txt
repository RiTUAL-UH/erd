 So we should lower taxes so people have more spending money?  




 No skiing?  









 Just started Division 3 and the opening scene is [this view] (https://localtvkdvr.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/750px-folsom_field.jpg) 




 That was a fumble-6, not an incompletion 
 




 Insert weed joke here  




 I'm watching high school boys intently on Twitter  




 Something something Ralphie something fifth down  




 You know it'll be Kodak or Walmart  




 I have [EPS] (http://youtu.be/tbKOEJIcIKI) 




 Full time college student here, I just work weekends  




 My class actually mentioned those ports and how to handle them in that situation  




 What does it say about U of A when Colorado goes to 2OT against a team that Arizona only beat with a hail mary? 




 [Following the Boulder flood] (https://vimeo.com/77180229). It's not an adrenaline hype video, but pretty damn motivational 




 The double OT game against Cal stands out. I had about 5 heart attacks during it. 
[Highlights start 25 seconds in] (http://youtu.be/J_vsfhQHpSU) 




 2008 called, they want their Obama poster back  




 Most of Colorado already does this. Still use plastic  




 I'll give the CSU section a [nice wink] (https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/5c/3e/54/5c3e5469c8349025937ef47b30812ac1.gif) at the RMS  




 In the name of harbaugh, the M, and fucking Ohio State amen.  




 Well this is the first CSU post I did. 
Second, get the fuck off of Ralphie! 




 Trying to find them is God awful  




 Well there goes my summer  




 Winter snow accumulation? Well you've never been to Boulder. It snows one day and is gone the next. Unless it's been cold for days before snowing then the snow will just melt right off the panels on contact  




 Above average. It's enough that 20lbs isn't noticeable, or 50 in your case  














 Water level should be low enough by then  




 Go up flagstaff or sanitas and watch the Folsom field fireworks and the many others over the skyline  




 I'm sure there are, I just listed the ones I knew without searching. I was hoping people would post suggestion to make the last 70 days of off season go by  




 It's early but Paul Richardson (Seahawks) tore his ACL in his rookie season and missed the superbowl. He's come back in the past, hoping he can do it again  




 Pretty sure November 2011 is Sandusky  




 Did a quick search and it looks like a list hasn't been done in awhile, so let this be a list of cfb movies/documentaries on Netflix or online free sites. 

Off the top of my head-

Happy Valley 
30:30 the U
Rudy  




 Wisconsi, not sure if it counts since it's my flair  




 I think they should have a field day once it's done, let people come check it out and throw a ball around.  




 It's definitely enough for lighting, like you said climate control would  be the issue. However  it's cool enough sept through bowl season to not need cooling. I'd imagine they have some very efficient insulation as well. 
I believe I saw somewhere that the facility would also use a feedback loop for climate control, possibly with Folsom field. I've having issues finding it 
Edit- [here's the same company working on making levi stadium net zero] (https://joinmosaic.com/blog/levis-49er-stadium-leads-net-zero-energy-race/) 




 Sure looked like panels when I walked past.  




 The burp girl 
 




 "indoor practice facility is partnering with SunPower to install a 55,000 square foot solar panel array that will generate 850kW of electricity.  Almost half of the roof will be covered with solar panels allowing it to be a net-zero electricity facility, meaning it creates more energy than it consumes. There will even be a live dashboard that will display how much energy is being produced, and other information about the panels on the roof mounted in the facility."
[source](http://bsndenver.com/what-you-didnt-know-about-the-new-cu-facilities-part-1/). 
The climate control will be by evaportive coolers. These use 1/8th the power of air conditioning. They can be used in Boulder because of the area's low humidity. 

Edit- apparently there's a neighborhood in Boulder that is zero energy, from 2009

 You forgot [this girl] (http://i.imgur.com/SE2KeCb.gif) 




 I think redoing the west side is in discussion. They mentioned tearing down Balch Field house. I really hope they manage to keep the field house but I guess they won't need it if they can put a floor down in the practice facility for non-football events. Expanding the concourse on coors has also been in discussion, I don't see how they do that with the little room to expand outside.  




 And burn away the shame of another loss  




 How about free weed?  




 I thought I would try writing my own type of construction update as I pass by the facilities daily. 

Construction updates are all over /r/cfb so what makes this one unique? Green innovation. 
The solar panels on the indoor practice facility have started being placed. The skeleton of the structure is viewable on the [construction cam] (http://www.cubuffs.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=209458799). So why do solar panels matter? They matter because the [indoor practice facility](http://www.cusustainableexcellence.com/ipf.html), 110,000 square feet, will be the only self-sustaining indoor practice facility in the country. 

This isn't the first CU athletic facility to lead the nation in a green initiative, Folsom Field became the [first zero waste stadium in 2008] (http://www.colorado.edu/ecenter/zero-waste-football-games). This is all part of [Ralphie's Green Stampede] (http://www.cubuffs.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=1549812) that consists of many eco-friendly initiatives to keep CU as one of the greenest and most innovative universities. 

The setting of CU on the edge of the Rocky Mountains is a constant reminder of why CU leads the way in building a more sustainable future.  The new facilities will also lead Colorado football into a brighter future, with sustained success to rival that of the 90's. After all, if you build it, they will come. Well, 3 people are coming so far....  




 Bless your heart  




 Seems like a lot of reps/sets. I'd suggest knocking off some of the high reps sets  




 Any suggestions for protein that's easy on the stomach? 




 I would rethink the reps. I do 5x5 and my weights go up 5lbs a week for bench and squat. I study exercise science and high weight with few reps will get your max strength higher while lower weight at high reps is more endurance. Its fast twitch vs slow twitch muscle fibers if your interested in checking it out  




 You don't look much bigger, part of being tall, but your shape has definitely improved. More of a chest and less of a gut. Size will come 




 Because you don't have birds chirping. Call me crazy but I hate birds, mostly because they have a nest outside my window so they wake me up at dawn  




 Hopefully in the next renovation... 




 Troughs. Sorry  




 We tried this last year, didn't help  




 Plus it can get below freezing in the mountains that time of year  




 Free tickets with purchase from dispensary  




 Just need California to legalize and over half the pac would be legal. 

Pac 12- conference of pothead champions  




 [moose] (http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_28359296/moose-loose-boulder-police-scare-late-night-visitor)

Edit- apparently [this video] (https://m.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/3amojj/house_cat_doesnt_give_a_shit_about_mountain_lion/)of a mountain lion and cat happened just outside of boulder  




 Give out weed? Have a weed garden? 
Honestly it's hard to get fans to show when you're surrounded by the rocky Mountains. Having night games would help  




 But........we have weed  




 TIL how it was made. 
It would be very odd if a candidate didn't use red white and blue. Obama's campaign stood out because he was a younger guy with great marketing  




 I was referring more to the red white and blue self portraits, the hope and change. Obama's campaign was extremely visual  




 So the conservative version of  think progress? 




 Obama knew this 
Edit- referring to the red white and blue street art posters  




 Home life does more to education than education itself  




 Poor poor liberal victim. Here have some hope and change.  




 But why male models? 
Ben stiller forgot the line and was restarting the scene. It worked well  




 Leaving the hospital with the failed explosion  




 Obesity has a very simple fix, put down the fork. 
However people with obesity have reasons for over eating usually associated with lack of discipline/confidence so food because emotional support  




 Ah memories. I made it to every pearl st bar that night, with a drink at each, after starting at half fast. 

If CU starts out 5-0 with a win against Oregon, pearl st will have a real stampede  




 It's simple, we kill the batman. 

But seriously you have to find the root cause, no its  not movies or video games, and fix that. I don't know enough to know that cause  




 http://www.amazon.com/MANGROOMER-Flushable-Personal-Engineered-Executive/dp/B0090N3SKM 




 As someone in Colorado, weed.  




 That's a day's worth of food for me 




 Only half price for the first 12 months. Can't reuse edu emails either  




 I saw that shower thought too 




 Apparently they don't include new jerseys  




 Camo can be bought at many places  




 [Ironically he writes gang rape erotica] (http://nypost.com/2015/06/05/bernie-sanders-rape-fantasy-essay-reveals-left-wing-hypocrisy/)

I don't think the erotica represents his personal views, but it's kinda ironic  




 It's as if Huffington post twisted his words!

"The placement of a Confederate flag on the Capitol grounds is a state issue and I fully expect the leaders of South Carolina to debate this but the conversation should wait until after the families have had a chance to bury and mourn their loved ones," Walker said in a statement to BuzzFeed last week. 
 




 If you actually read the misleading article, he said he trust South Carolina to handle it, he never said he was for the flag.  




 [Just like Clinton] (http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/17/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-change-position-same-sex-marriage/) 




 Very misleading title. He never said he supports it. He called for it to be taken down years ago, then recently said he trusts South Carolina will handle it. 

"The placement of a Confederate flag on the Capitol grounds is a state issue and I fully expect the leaders of South Carolina to debate this but the conversation should wait until after the families have had a chance to bury and mourn their loved ones," Walker said in a statement to BuzzFeed last week. 
 




 Fixing our violent culture would decrease gun deaths, stabbing, assualts, and any other way you harm someone  









 Like when you want to return an item to Amazon but they refund you and say don't bother returning it. How do they do that? Amazing  




 Being a liberal doesn't make you a hippie, but being a hippie makes it near certain you're a liberal. Close enough?  




 Except I can leave my house and comeback with a replacement phone 30min later. Other companies require you send it in  




 That customer service though  




 1% of the world consumes 99% of the world's food  




 And the majority of preventable illnesses are obesity related. The same conditions are the top costs in healthcare.  




 Except they have a bowl already 




 I mean, they worked. 
If they actually got made into swim trunks I'd buy a pair  




 Toss up between the new uniforms and new facilities  




 Our pac bro will beat you and we're going to beat you next year with another miracle in Michigan  




 11am- wake up still hungover from watching the game at 11pm mountain against Hawaii the Thursday before. 

1130am start watching whatever games are on. 

9pm go to the bars. 

1159pm get a drink thrown in my face  




 Were spending record amounts of money per student and getting poor results. Money isn't the problem. It's students who don't care because of shitty home lives, teachers (some not all) that get lazy after getting tenure.  




 NRA fights that data collection because the data will show how much shootings occur. However that data won't show the reason behind it. The reason being the US is a violent country. Guns aren't the problem, society is.  




 [were just a violent country] (http://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2012/07/20/america-is-a-violent-country/). Fix the violence, and gun deaths will go down. If you think violence will decrease without guns you are mistaken. The US still has an above average rate of stabbing and bare hand assualts when compared to other countries  









 I'm interested in how that would work. Do you have more info? 

Edit- downvoted for being interested and wanting to learn something, never change /r/politics  









 I don't understand what you're getting at  




 Jeb Bush actually took down the flag in Florida back in 2000.  




 Changing US culture to not be as violent would be better than gun control. Most other first world countries aren't near as violent at the US.
