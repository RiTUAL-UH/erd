 I really just want a cheaper version of a brogue boot. Something inexpensive, but still durable.  




 I love [these boots](http://www.allenedmonds.com/aeonline/producti_SF0181_1_40000000001_-1_) but need a MUCH cheaper option. Like around $100-$150. I definitely want burgundy as my color, but I am definitely open to looking into other styles, materials even (doesn't have to be leather, could be suede, what are options outside of suede burgundy CDBs?) 




 my question really is just how much is your heel supposed to move
