 The first two are authentic time lapsed photos the third is a artist rendition.

 He's still young enough for behavior modification/ training maybe obedience school would help if there is no physical/ health reason for his poor behavior.  




 My 14 year-old dog started to get grumpy and I took him to the vet and explained the problem but the vet found no problems with his health, I got him home and did a complete exam and found he had a molar going bad so I took him to another vet and had the tooth pulled, he's back to normal now behavior wise. Finding the bad tooth was not easy at all. I had to push on it just right to invoke a reaction from my mutt.

 As Price was jumping back over the counter, he shot a sixty-seven year old customer who tried to stop him. After shooting the customer in the neck, Price left the bank, discharging two (2) rounds from his revolver as he fled. The shooting victim was transported by Deerfield Beach Fire Rescue to North Broward Medical Center. He remains in critical but stable condition

The bank is insured so this was a stupid move on the old guys part, foolish hero.
