 I have a cousins 21st dinner and can't order the usual water or juice without giving away the pregnancy. They know I wouldn't pass up a drink or two otherwise. 

I've seen lemon lime bitters served to children. But was recently informed they still contain alcohol. Should a glass or two with tea matter? or have you any other suggestions as to drinks that appear alcoholic but aren't? Haha.
