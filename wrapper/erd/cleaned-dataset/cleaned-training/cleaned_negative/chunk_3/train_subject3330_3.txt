 [Land on your own moon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHxicjFRnoo) 




 I am starting to hate this sub... serisouly, in between the one or two good posts each month there are countless:

TIL my favorite actor / singer / band / whatever did or was in / voiced / sang / cameod in who the fuck cares... What is there to discuss about your amazing revelation that these people, well, work?

Sick of this pop culture shlock that is this sub. 




 Sweet, nice price point and cross buy with Vita/PS4 to boot. Def downloading once I get home.

And finally something on the Vita thats not an anime JRPG or 2D indie game. 




 TIL Keith Wickham is a voice actor.

Uhhh... Great OP, anything to discuss here? 




 The way he's holding that pistol annoys me, the angle of the gun, it just looks... wrong. 




 Latvian holy land?  




 Final destination OP... You have roughly 3 days before you meet your demise from some convoluted Rube Goldberg machine of death. 




  I was 22 at the time, already had two kids.

I guess that's one way to live your life. 




 We don't tip in Australia. 




 Fathers Linguini. 




 When I first played online it threw me into a skydiving mission and then it kicked me offline, after rejoining it threw me into the middle of a race then again, kicked me offline...

I know not of this first mission you speak of.  




 It's not that there less games being made in Japan it's more that only a very small fraction of Japanese games make it to the western market.The rest don't get localized.  




 Dads Linguini? 




 If The Goonies taught me anything [this](http://i.imgur.com/I0GUFZk.jpg) is all you'll need. 




 Thats not a cat... [it's a tiny seal!](http://i.imgur.com/AUKjrTE.jpg) 




 Now... Google image search: "*Your real name* The Hedgehog" and get ready for a glimpse into the sad world of Sonic Fandom. 




 [Look at what I did, no one will ever be able to copy me with this one](http://i.imgur.com/2vXtrq9.jpg) 




 Prolapse Bird? 




 What are you people doing with your watches for this to happen? 

Are you trying to pull the straps so fucken hard that you want to cut off circulation to your hand or what?  




 [No ones in the air](http://imgur.com/tBqPVTX) 




 [Fixed it for you](http://i.imgur.com/aSASG8T.jpg), you're welcome. 




 This plot twist in history bought to you by: M Night Shyamalan. 




 [Hired Goons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YK2Mrh8HPIQ) 




 [OH YEAAHH!](http://i.imgur.com/sQuDLJv.jpg) 




 Looks like Tekken 5. 




 I just tried playing it on a website, the game wouldn't let me eat the welcome floor mat... or set it on fire. 




 I think it's like The Wheel Of Fortune and buying a vowel?

Meaning him spending $700k is the equivalent of you buying an "A"? 




 Eugenics: The practice of removing all persons named Eugene from the population.

I'm ok with this.  




 Kyle: Let me go back to bang your mom... err save us all John.

John: Ok Kyle, but remember, you're the last hope of humanity.

*Kyle Starts to take of his pants*

John: What're you doing Kyle, you know we can send people back fully clothed now.

*Kyle continues to undress*

Kyle: It... It just feels right. 




 The story is John dies along with the rest of humanity.

That is the whole premise of the series itself and the whole time travel to stop this happening dealio. 




 One of my favorite action movies, so much fun. 




 Hold the "LEFT" directional button. 




 Something something M Night Shyamalan. 




 THERE ARE NO BUGS, ONLY FEATURES. 




 Also [Time Crimes](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0480669/) 




 Optus: $99 a month for unlimited cable 7-10mbps. 

Granted I dont usually get those speeds though _ 




 OP: We need to go to Warp 4, ISP

ISP: We just cant do it OP, we dont have the power.

OP: God dammit ISP, either we go to Warp 4 now or Google Fiber will be the end of you... 




 Automata, Antonio Banderas' latest movie is about this very thing. 

It's not a great movie but is still worth a watch if you're interested in dystopian sci-fi where AI becomes self aware. 




 Reminds me of Red Dwarf and how there was an AI in almost everything electronic.

There was an episode where the vending machine had a vendetta against Rimmer. 




 Then you have the [homage to Footloose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyZzXbc0eSk) 




 Raising Cain, classic insane Lithgow. 




 Well you're on reddit... so you're not really living, more like in limbo? 




 So.... the Borg? 




 Strange,  doesn't have that text here in Australia. Best to contact Sony from this point.  




 That is for the demo / trial?  




 16th century Wolverine would not have Adamantium claws... 




 Is that a good thing or a bad thing? 









 Seriously?

The fuck man... Why would you want that sort of crap in a game?

Turn off the PS4, go outside and kill animals and kids in the real world like a normal person.

 That boy aint kawaii, I tell ya hwat desu ne.

 Plot twist: The new creature is the Brundlefly 




 But can you tell me what happens when you find a stranger in the Alps? 




 [MURICA!](http://i.imgur.com/h6LLwbs.jpg)

*Edit:* Gold for the Corn Dog or for the Big Mac? Either way much appreciated!  




 Plot twist: They re-created the Brundlefly. 




 Its a message: I print therefore I am. 




 Destroy it now, it's become self aware. 




 You're not in Guatemala now Dr Ropata. 




 Maybe not the next day.. but the next purge, you betcha.  




 India is the Mushroom Kingdom? 




 Make your own decisions, better yet just give me your money if you want to get rid of it so bad. 




 Paul Reubens, is that you? 




 "If you build it, they will come" 




 TIL about Penny Pong. Today was a good day. 




 Me and my mates used to play fake cricket on the grass out front of the state library across from melb central.

Was stupid teenage fun. 




 "And my Axe... wait, where is that thing, anyone seen it?" 




 Around 25 mins in, Operation Big City... WHAT THE FUCK AMERICA. 




 Nah he was a top bloke and knew when to call the quits. Sure he had a bad trip himself, but he didn't ruin anyone else's good time. 




 So which one did you draw as a toddler?   




 Comment. 




 Pfft, real gangsters use coins and make it hail.

It's a down economy yo. 




  AReddit user has compiled an image gallery of more than 100 video game toilets, for some reason.


Alright, which one of you was it?.. and why?  




 The dot that  is you looks like a mole on the inside of a woman's thigh and the loop is... 




 Let me quote the OP for you:

 




 Trypophobia is not a real thing, stop trying to make it happen.  




 Looks like adult [Enzo Matrix]( http://i.imgur.com/o43EDIZ.png) 




 Link or Ganon got all up in there for sure.  




 And using shrooms, an illegal class 1 drug you're ok with, but downloading a copy of a video game... that's where you draw the line?  




 [1988](http://i.imgur.com/JswhoYh.jpg) 




 Was the inspiration for "Shoot em up" as well.
Which is also a good, albeit ridiculous action movie. 




 [I really don't know what I'm doing...](http://i.imgur.com/0HaDcVD.jpg) 




 [Cat in a jacket](http://i.imgur.com/4bnyK1K.jpg) 




 That is a Cicada. 




 [My god... It's full of stars](http://i.imgur.com/zOuHZ3I.jpg) 




 2? 




 Now that you mention it... 




 A movie about a squad of  3 or  4 soldiers during a mission. The story you  can make whatever you want really. 

The default film is made from spliced footage captured from their helmet cams during the mission making one coherent story.

You could even make it in a way so you can watch each characters / soldiers feed independently showing a seperate individual story per character.

Effectively you can make it 3 or 4 movies in one go without any extra work or filming.

I think it would be a fun project at least.  




 
TL;DR

Billions of planets that are 90% the same  due to being randomly generated from limited assets. 




 Well there goes that idea. 




 Random thought, is this possible?

We know the 360 has USB pins under a sticker when the strap connects... So would it be possible to create a watch strap as I have crudely drawn that has a USB connector on it along with an additional battery built into the strap?

Forgive my lack of artistic talent...  









 I have the opposite problem, it used to work fine till the last update.

Now it's over sensitive... The screen turns on whenever I move my arm a tiny bit, even while at my desk and typing it'll turn on. 




 I would like to know more. 




 I loved  Bryans charged roundhouse kick for the same reason, the taunt he does if he connects... Especially if its the killing blow.  




 TIL the word avulsion.

Today was a good day.  




 Last pic, praising the sun!? 




 [Rather dapper young chap I must say](http://i.imgur.com/OhX4Ytb.jpg) 




 This is not from Family Guy, it's from Seth MacFarlane's Cavalcade of Cartoon Comedy. 




 Has anyone actually cared about a Tekken release since 4?
