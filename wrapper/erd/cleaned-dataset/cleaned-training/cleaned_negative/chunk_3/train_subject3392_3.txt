 The guys at work smoke pipes at work after lunch, and now that I've quit smoking,  (Two weeks! Thanks to you guys!) I feel a bit left out. Ideally I could find something with variable voltage that would work with all of the ego threaded things I have. 




 I just got an ego twist and a handful of clearos, and I'm wondering how to carry it around. It seems like it would snap in half instantly if i just had it in my jeans pocket  I was thinking about getting a metal cigar tube, but I wanted to hear what ideas you guys had.   




 What is the BAM? 




 Wow, that looks awesome!  Pricey, but I'm sure it's worth it.  What kind of atomizer or cartomizer do you use?
