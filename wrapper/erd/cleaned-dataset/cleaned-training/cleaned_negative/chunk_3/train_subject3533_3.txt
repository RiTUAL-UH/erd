 Teemo is such a butt turd licking butt. I want my oracles back ;-; The only pure enjoyment I have when fighting against a Teemo is killing him. 

(My boyfriend and I have a great relationship. :P He hates it when I give him skins, too much pride in that man. We just both dislike Teemo...) 




 If you get gifted with a skin on sale lower than 520 with a higher base price, you'll get a refund. So, technically you're not allowed to get gifted skins on sale. :(  




 Gifted my boyfriend two teemo skins... He hates me and our relationship is in ruins. Thanks teemo  




 Is it me or is the PC one only listing the base price with no sale? I've been wanting this expansion for a while. 




 THANK YOU! I didn't know which kind of tutorial video to watch :( 




 So should I just build around where I originally spawn? How do I navigate these hills? 




 I just bought the game during the Steam Community Choice sale and I'm having trouble. Any tips for a complete newbie?

 Anyone notice how when Hurt's about to press the big red button, 10 and 11 are standing side by side with Clara behind 11 and "Rose" behind 10?
