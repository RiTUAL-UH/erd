 well-spotted! Removed:

Your post will likely be removed if it:

has a title not taken from the article.

my original comment was based solely on personal knowledge, being in the UK 




 not your fault, sensationalist journalism on the part of abc.net.au 




 ONE protest, ONE 









 correct,   now he's banned 









  Hehe. How about: "Before posting, please read the Windows 10 FAQ

[done](http://i.imgur.com/3YAQMId.png)

/u/whtsnk has expressed a legitimate concerned although outright banning such questions may be over the top. 

bans ain't gonna happen, downvote/ignore   move on

So, maybe a sticky? I believe sticky posts would appear at the top whether on desktop, mobile, even with CSS disabled, correct? 

Yes, it will appear for all users, mobile or desktop. ~~I'll see to that 1 in the AM~~, another mod can handle that 1, I'm off to play golf :)
 




  Then maybe (as you seem to be a wizard) it would be possible to implement a banner that appears when hovering the Submit button?

a banner saying what? And remember such a thing would not be visible to mobile users, or those who have subreddit CSS disabled. And tooltips are my coding limit, but our CSS guru /u/xvvhiteboy  can handle such things. What I CAN do is this:

  Actually it's already on the sidebar. /u/train_subject3554 was kind enough to add the Windows 10 FAQ to the sidebar as I suggested.

[with a tooltip!](http://i.imgur.com/3pUhdtz.png) Mustn't forget the tooltip :)

 should have woken her 2 minutes earlier   said "how the HELL did we get to Alabama?" 




 is she just mega-comfortable or have you duct-taped her to the seat :) ? 




  my lab is actually the hyper af one. my Akita is actually pretty lazy... she only moves for bananas and kibble

bananas? Fussy :) My lab spent her days on her personal armchair, with a child's pacifier to comfort her (terrible pic, sorry, old)

 that bird's got balls (is that even possible?). Is that a territorial thing or something? 




 betcha the lab's the patient one ...

http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/04/28/what-you-really-need-to-know-about-baltimore-from-a-reporter-who-lived-there-for-30-years/

*Not long after I moved to Baltimore, my wifes car was stolen in front of our house, which then was just four or five blocks from North and Pennsylvania avenues, the epicenter of Mondays disturbance.  The police came and asked the usual questions before my wife piped up, What do you guys do to find stolen cars?

One of the cops responded that the cars usually turn up a few days later when the joyriders run out of gas. Then, without irony or, seemingly, malicious intent, he looked at us  a young black couple  and said: If we see a group of young black guys in a car, we pull them over. 

















































 Excellent track, I felt sorry for the [poor creature](http://i.imgur.com/bHzmDRq.png) NSFW :( 










































































 I'll take your word for that :) (film reference?) 




  doesn't England have a minors prison? Like juvenile hall here in America? 

yes, young offenders centres, commonly called "Borstal", but they too can be pretty vicious 



























































 /r/Assistance is your best bet 














 no code, nothing mysterious :) At the same time as I submitted this article, I submitted THIS:

http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/33kq2p/german_military_to_stop_using_gun_that_cant_shoot/

which apparently caused /u/LuckyBdx4's browser to crash, so I simply linked him to the same story on another site. I don't know anything about his browser issues, I'm not an Apple user, but apparently The Guardian crashes Safari for him every time he loads their site

 









 ouch :(
