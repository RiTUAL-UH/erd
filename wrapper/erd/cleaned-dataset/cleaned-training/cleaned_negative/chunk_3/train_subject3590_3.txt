  As for spices I think you would be fine if you just goto to the store and buy the following:

* Cumin
* Paprika
* Cayenne
* Cinnamon 
* Nutmeg
* dried mint
* oregano
* Bay Leaves
* thyme \ Rosemary 
* tumeric 

Perhaps also:
* Coriander
* Cardamom
* Saffron
* fennel seeds
* mustard seeds
* Cloves
 
I hate buying spices in America because you can't try them first. As far as I'm concerned they're all terrible so it doesn't make a difference if you get them from one place or another.  




 amazing left hand! The guy is clearly a huge virtuoso but I missed the ornaments that really make Balkan music what it is.  




 My advice (as an accordionist) is wake her up with a home cooked breakfast, not accordion music. . .

 Hi!

I'm making a minced mushroom filling for Iranian "sambusas" kinda like baked samosas. I'm wondering if I should sear the mushrooms whole first or if I can mince them first raw and then cook.

What I did this time:
Minced shallots   browned in butter\oliveoil 
Minced 'shrooms and added to the pan and seasoned 
I was also going to add walnuts but forgot! (woops...)

 Sound designer\accordionist here. Feedback suppressors, if you're *very* lucky address the symptom but not the overall problem. When you get to the venue you need to consider your placement in relation the speakers. Are you playing in front of the speakers? This will create feedback in nearly any system. Perhaps you're mics are gained to high. If you address these two things and it's still a problem, then you can look into some EQ - For this individually raise each band until you find the one that corresponds with the root frequency of the feedback. What band enduces feedback. Once you find it, you can bring it back until the feedback is reduced. It's much better to manually counteract it like this than to use a feedback suppressor in attempt to address it automatically (which probably won't work). I've never met a sound professional  who uses one of these devices.

 The other day I saw what looked like an engine but it had writing on it saying it was "Squad Company 5" or something like that. What purpose do these companies serve?  




 Long story short i had a FOs install apt today and mobilyan showed up. After 7 hours of calling customer support I finally reach the executive support line where I'm told that fios isn't available in my building dispite prior notices of availability. 

Later I get a call from the guy in the truck who tells me he actually came but the neighboring landlord refused to give permission to run the line past his building! I went to the restarant downstairs in the building next door where they refused to give me their LLord's contact info and mentioned that I'm not the first person to complain. I did some detective work and found the guy's address and associated phone number. I tried calling but nobody picked up. 

What should I do!?
Isn't he in violation of section 228 of public service law by denying a utility? 









 I've travelled to the furthest reaches of [Svaneti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svaneti) and yet the biggest culture shock I've ever faced is in LAS VEGAS. It's like Mars. Last time I was there, I witnessed an interaction between a young girl who had just gotten back from a rave at around 9:30 am and and older gentleman in the elevator of the Luxor. The girl said "I too so much E and now I can't remember my room number." Then she asked the older man "are you rolling?!" and he said "Have you every heard of Jesus Christ?"

 Hi all

I'm looking for a place that can add a padded hip strap (camping style) to a heavy-duty cordura instrument case of mine that must support approximate 35 lbs. 

Tips?
