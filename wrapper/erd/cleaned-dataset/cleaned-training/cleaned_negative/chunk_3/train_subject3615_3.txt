 I find no logic in comparing the wars the U.S. began after 9/11 with WWII (which was put in motion by Hitlers invasion of Poland). I find it equally offensive to simply accept the justification that there are fewer casualties in todays wars."

After 9/11 the U.S. literally raced off to war without even conducting proper, thorough investigations of what ACTUALLY took place. Evil Dick Cheney even asked Senator Tom Daschle, who was on the Intelligence Committee, [NOT to investigate 9/11 on several occassions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePOIhhd9Jr0).

Afghanistan offered to turn UBL over to U.S. authorities if the U.S. provided proof he had ordered the strikes--but the U.S. didnt even respond. Instead, the CIA began operations in Afghanistan by going  around Tora Bora throwing millions of dollars in cash to local tribes...Of course, the CIA came up empty handed.

We all know the intelligence was cooked on Iraq to give Bush/Cheney their useless, illegal war.




 




 the CIA has been doing much more than intervening in Syria--the CIA has been helping to pump in cargo planes filled with weapons since 2012

 I was impressed with Shenons *The Commission*--but definitely do understand David Ray Griffins frustration with Shenon. I think part of what Shenon has attempted to capture in *The Commission* and *A Cruel and Shocking Act* was the inner workings of the way the 9/11 Commission and the Warren Commission functioned; meaning that Shenon was not trying to reveal the truth of what happened on 11-22-63 or 9/11. Shenon was more interested in the structure of the commissions, how the information flowed and the personalities which ended up controlling the output. 

Personally, I find this approach to be obtuse--how could Shenon not find a way to follow up with some investigation at the NSA?

Everybody wins, especially the CIA. 

The only loser was the State Dept.--but blaming the victim is usually the easiest route.

The fact that it takes 5 years and $40 million to edit" the Torture Report should also tell you a lot about how CROOKED the US government is--and how incredibly NAIVE Americans are.

 A Little History...

--------------

In 1949, the CIA installed a pro-American colonel, Adib Shishakli, as the Syrian leader. He won direct American military assistance along with covert financial aid. The CIA station chief in Damascus, Miles Copeland, called the colonel "a likeable rogue" who "had not, to my certain knowledge, ever bowed down to a graven image. He had, however, committed sacrilege, blasphemy, murder, adultery and theft." He lasted four years before he was overthrown by Ba'ath Party and communist politicians and military officers. 

In March 1955, Allen Dulles predicted that the country was "ripe for a military coup d'etat" supported by the agency. In April 1956, the CIA's Kim Roosevelt and his British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) counterpart Sir George Young tried to mobilize right-wing Syrian army officers; the CIA delivered half a million Syrian pounds to the leaders of the plot. But the Suez fiasco poisoned the political climate in the Middle East, pushed Syria closer to the Soviets, and forced the Americans and the British to postpone their plan at the end of October 1956.

In the spring and summer of April 1957,they revived it. A document discovered in 2003 among the private papers of Duncan Sandys, Prime Minister Harold Macmillan's defense secretary, spells out their effort in detail.

Syria had to be "made to appear as the sponsor of plots, sabotage and violence directed against neighbouring governments," it said. CIA and SIS would manufacture "national conspiracies and various strong-arm activities" in Iraq, Lebanon, and Jordan, and blame them on Syria. They would create paramilitary factions and spark revolts among the Muslim Brotherhood in Damascus. The creation of the appearance of instability would destabilize the government; border clashes manufactured by American and British intelligence would serve as a pretext for the pro- Western armies of Iraq and Jordan to invade. The CIA and SIS envisioned that any new regime they installed would likely "rely first upon repressive measures and arbitrary exercise of power" to survive.

Roosevelt identified Abdul Hamid Serraj, the longtime chief of the Syrian intelligence service, as the most powerful man in Damascus. Serraj was to be assassinated,along with the chief of the Syrian general staff and the head of the Communist Party.

The CIA sent Rocky Stone, who had cut his teeth in the Iran operation, to serve as the new chief of station in Damascus. Accredited as a diplomat, a second secretary at the American embassy, he used promises of millions of dollars and unlimited political power to befriend officers in the Syrian army. He represented his recruits in reports to headquarters as a crack corps for an American-backed coup.

Abdul Hamid Serraj saw through Stone in a matter of weeks.
The Syrians set up a sting. "The officers with whom Stone was deal- ing took his money and then went on television and announced that they had received this money from the 'corrupt and sinister Americans' in an attempt to overthrow the legitimate government of Syria," said Curtis F. Jones, a State Department officer sent to clean up the mess Stone left behind. Serraj's forces surrounded the American embassy in Damascus, seized Stone, and interrogated him roughly. He told them everything he knew. The Syrians identified him publicly as an American spy posing as a diplomat, a veteran of the CIA's coup in Iran, and a conspirator with Syrian army officers and politicians to overthrow the government in exchange for millions of dollars in American aid.

The revelation of this "particularly clumsy CIA plot," in the words of the U.S. ambassador to Syria, Charles Yost, had consequences that reverberate today. The Syrian government formally declared Rocky Stone persona non grata. That was the first time that an American diplomat of any stripebe he a spy working undercover or a bona fide State Department officerhad been expelled from an Arab nation. In turn, the United States expelled the Syrian ambassador to Washington, the first expulsion of any foreign diplomat from Washington since World War I. The United States denounced Syria's "fabrications" and "slanders." Stone's Syrian co-conspirators, including the former president, Adib Shishakli, were sentenced to death. A purge of every military officer who had ever been associated with the American embassy followed.

 This is part of the problem--DISSENTING VOICES are being categorically stricken from the main stream media, and now from the larger subreddits as well. 

The media has become fully complicit in the Pep Rallies to go to war in Syria. Far too often we are fed headlines with unsubstantiated facts. Then a few days later the facts dissolve into dust, but the headline has served its purpose: to strike fear and hate into the U.S. taxpayers so the CIA and the NSA and the Pentagon can proceed with their bombings and their spying and their killing.
 




 Maybe the U.S. told Germany they will never get their gold back if they investigate. 




 and Why is RT--a Russian funded station--the Only channel still asking questions??? 




 Which is why I found Amy Zegarts findings to be shocking--the intelligence oversight committees between 1985-2005 ranked LAST in hearings held every year except for one. 

In the "Age of Terrorism" you would think we would demand a more public display of evidence. Instead, we know more about Casey Anthony than we do about the 9/11 terrorists. There have only been 2 criminal trials related to 9/11 in the U.S.--Zacarias Moussouai and UBLs driver (forget his name).  




 Surprising how quiet Americans are about the systemic consitutional violations conducted by the NSA since 9/11. Theres only been 1 writer (Lucy Steigerwald) that I know of who was bold enough to even suggest we think about some prosecutions (and that was for the Torture)...

I guess the CIA is considering changing up the infrastructure as well--the Wash Post had an article which Ray McGovern cited in his latest editorial over at Consortium News.  




 Most Americans dont even realize how many countries the U.S. is actively conducting operations in...

-----------------

It is time for members of Congress who truly care about rule of law, oversight and the financial security of this country to speak up. Why? Because, first and foremost, the AUMF continues to contravene congressional oversight. For example, when the Obama administration sent 100 "military advisors" to Uganda in the name of counterterrorism in 2011, Congress received a simple note from President Obama. No oversight.

More recently, after unilaterally negotiating a "status of forces" agreement with Niger, the administration sent a note to Congress saying that it was sending 100 troops to the country. This week, we sent troops to Mali. Again, no oversight.

This is the new normal. Statistics provided by Special Operations Command (pdf) indicate that special forces groups were operating in 92 different countries in March 2013. The AUMF premise, no matter how it gets tweaked, is enabling a system of eternal warfare, a reality that is not only financially untenable for a nation in deep debt, but also ethically indefensible.

http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/05/authorization-use-military-force-blank-check 




 the other problem is the massive privatization of the military-intelligence sectors--how do we have any idea what they are doing? Dana Priest and William Arkin wrote the book Top Secret America (which was also a WaPo special investigation, then a Frontline documentary)...

* Some 1,271 government organizations and 1,931 private companies work on programs related to counterterrorism, homeland security and intelligence in about 10,000 locations across the United States.

* An estimated 854,000 people, nearly 1.5 times as many people as live in Washington, D.C., hold top-secret security clearances.

* In Washington and the surrounding area, 33 building complexes for top-secret intelligence work are under construction or have been built since September 2001. Together they occupy the equivalent of almost three Pentagons or 22 U.S. Capitol buildings - about 17 million square feet of space.

 Yes, History Commons has some surprising strains. Regarding the 70s oversight committees, last year Foreign Policy published an article that was based entirely on just one page of an internal NSA history which proved the NSA was spying on Sen. Frank Church (among many other Americans). I think it was Page 83 of a 2 Volume history--what do the other pages contain (and how many total pages are there)?

GLENN HASTEDT, AUG 23 2013

A starting point to deciphering how effectively Congress has handled its intelligence oversight responsibility here is to look to existing studies of congressional oversight.  They depict a weak oversight system marked by two characteristics.  First, it is overwhelmingly reactive, rather than anticipatory: it acts as a fireman responding to a problem rather than as police officers on patrol looking for problems.  Congressional oversight is thus sporadic.  It occurs when a fire breaks out and ceases when the fire is extinguished, to return again should smoldering embers produce another fire.

This pattern is very much in evidence in intelligence community oversight.  Four major intelligence fires have been put out.   In the mid-1970s the fire was widespread illegal Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) activity within the United States including wiretapping and mail openings.  In the mid-1980s controversy centered on the Reagan administrations covert action program in Latin America.  The 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States brought forward the third congressional wave of intelligence community oversight.

Most recently we have witnessed a rapid series of fire alarms set off by disputes over the conduct of the Global War on Terrorism.  Collectively they can be seen as constituting a fourth major fire.  The first involved a secret warrantless surveillance program authorized by President George W. Bush in October 2001 giving the NSA  the authority to intercept communications between individuals on American soil and individuals abroad without judicial approval, in essence circumventing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance (FISA) Court.  The second centered on the nature of the techniques used to interrogate suspected terrorists at the Guantanamo Naval Base.  The third involved the increased use of drone aircraft to kill suspected terrorists, especially Americans.  The NSA revelations are the most current fire alarm to be set off.

Amy B. Zegart 	The Roots of Weak Congressional Intelligence Oversight 

Another senior intelligence official noted that oversight had deteriorated so much during his career that I dont even know what good oversight looks like anymore.[12] Overseers agreed. One legislator who served on a congressional intelligence committee called oversight horrible and said that improving even the intelligence budget process would mean that somebody in Congress would have to die.

These qualitative impressions are supported by two quantitative metrics most frequently used to evaluate oversight: hearing and legislative productivity. Tracking hearings held by fifteen House and Senate committees in 1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, and 2005, I found that the intelligence committees ranked at the bottom every year except one. In 2005, the House Intelligence Committee held just 23 hearings (both classified and unclassified), compared to 77 hearings in the Energy and Commerce Committee,
91 in the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, and 104 hearings held by the Foreign Affairs Committee. Intelligence committees also trailed behind others in producing legislation. In a comparison of legislative productivity among four major Senate policy committees, intelligence again ranked last. Between 1985 and 2005, the Senate Intelligence Committee considered an average of just six bills per year. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee considered an average of 118 bills per year, the Senate Banking Committee considered 161 bills, and the Senate Commerce Committee considered an average of 241 bills each year.

Zo Carpenter on January 30, 2014 

First, a brief history. After revelations about abuses by the CIA and other agencies in the 1970s, Congress struck what Stephen Vladeck, a professor of law at American University, calls a grand bargain, to accommodate the paradoxical need to submit secret programs to democratic oversight. New legal constraints on intelligence activities would be enforced not in public but instead behind the veil by the intelligence committees and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (also known as the FISA court). As Colorado Senator Mark Udall said at the Intelligence Committee hearing, This committee was created to address a severe breach of trust that developed when it was revealed that the CIA was conducting unlawful domestic searches.

The Snowden leaks indicate the bargain has broken down. In essence, the delicate balance Congress sought to strike thirty-five years ago now appears to be tipped, rather decisively, in favor of the intelligence community, Vladeck explained in an e-mail.

Intelligence officials have done some of that tipping themselves, by withholding information from the public and lawmakers. On Wednesday, Wyden said the committee had been stonewalled by intelligence officials; indeed, none of his questions received direct answers, although Wyden did receive promises from officials to get back to him by specific deadlines. Wyden also cited several incidents in which officials had given inaccurate testimony in public hearings. Last March, for example, James Clapper told Wyden that the NSA did not wittingly collect data on American citizens, a claim we now know from the Snowden leaks to be false.

Denis McDonough Supported Intelligence Oversight When Bush Was President
Posted: 10/28/2014 by Ali Watkins and Ryan Grim

In 2006, with the Bush administration resisting efforts by Congress to look into the execution of its global war on terror, the Center for American Progress published a thorough document outlining the role of transparency in democracy.

Previous Senate and House Members of the intelligence committees were notably different from their successors today," the report lamented. "They were more interested in performing their oversight function responsibly than in protecting the executive branch when a committee member was of the same party."

The paper's lead author: Denis McDonough.

Today, it's McDonough, the White House chief of staff, who is protecting the executive branch from Senate Democrats fighting to perform their oversight function.

But in 2006, Center for American Progress fellow McDonough was deeply unsatisfied with the state of intelligence oversight in the U.S. Congress. Its completely lacking and soft, he wrote in his report on the subject, and the committees are far too deferential to the executive branch.

There is also a history of Saudi money being used by the CIA (which GHW Bush was director of in 1976)...

From [Consortium News](http://www.consortiumnews.com/2000/121900b.html):

Weinberger was one of the first officials outside the White House to learn that Reagan had put the arm on **Saudi Arabia** to give the contras $1 million a month in 1984, as Congress was cutting off the CIA's covert assistance through what was known as the Boland Amendment.

Handling the contra-funding arrangements was Saudi ambassador **Prince Bandar**...
In 1985, the Saudis doubled their annual contra gift from $12 million to $25 million...


-------------------- 




 Some great tidbits in the History Commons Timeline that allow you to connect the dots--Cheney saved the Reagan-Bush presidency by defusing the Iran-Contra investigation...Cheney was then rewarded with the Sec. of Defense post under GHW Bush...I also didnt realize that David Addington was asst general counsel for the CIA during Iran-Contra (addington would become Cheneys attorney in the OVP under GW in 2001).

from http://www.consortiumnews.com/2000/110500b.html

-----------------

But the Reagan-Bush administration was not ready to tell all. Immediately, the administration and Republicans on Capitol Hill moved to counter and to contain the scandal. For his part, Bush insisted that he was not in the loop on the Iran-contra business.

Cheney to the Rescue

One of the key congressional Republicans fighting this rear-guard action was Rep. Dick Cheney of Wyoming, who became the ranking House Republican on the Iran-contra investigation. Cheney already enjoyed a favorable reputation in Washington as a steady conservative hand.

Cheney smartly exploited his relationship with Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., who was chairman of the Iran-contra panel. Hamilton cared deeply about his reputation for bipartisanship and the Republicans quickly exploited this fact.

A senior committee source said one of Cheneys top priorities was to block Democrats from deposing Vice President Bush about his Iran-contra knowledge. Cheney kept trying to intimidate Hamilton, the source said. He kept saying if we go down that road, we wont have bipartisanship.

So, Hamilton gave Bush a pass. The limited investigation also gave little attention to other sensitive areas, such as contra-drug trafficking and the public diplomacy operation. They were pared down or tossed out altogether.

Despite surrendering to Cheneys demands time and again, Hamilton failed, in the end, to get a single House Republican to sign the final report.

Only three moderate Republicans on the Senate side  Warren Rudman, William Cohen and Paul Trible  agreed to sign the report, after extracting more concessions. Cheney and the other Republicans submitted a minority report that denied that any significant wrongdoing had occurred.

The watered-down Iran-contra majority report essentially let Vice President Bush off the hook. Bushs political career was saved.

With the Iran-contra scandal contained, Bush mounted a 1988 presidential campaign that set the modern standard for negativity, race-baiting and a win-at-all-cost ethic. In 1989, Cheney became Bushs defense secretary.

 Perhaps the Saudis were helping the CIA create an enemy. After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the US defense industry needed to replace Enemy #1, the Communists...

 The U.S. has spent about [$10 TRILLION in total National Security Budget since 9/11](http://www.pogo.org/our-work/straus-military-reform-project/defense-budget/2014/americas-one-trillion-national-security-budget.html) including about $5 TRILLION on the useless wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. 

The lies of the Bush-Cheney War Criminals have all been shredded--there were no WMDs in Iraq, there were no Iraqi-Al Qaeda connections. The Bush-Cheney administration claimed Usama bin Laden (et al.) planned and carried out the attacks of 9/11--yet the administration balked when Afghanistan offered to capture and turn over UBL if the U.S. could show proof that UBL committed the 9/11 attacks. 

Instead, Bush-Cheney never provided any evidence--they sent in the CIA into Afghanistan with plenty of CASH on hand to pay off Afghan warlords to help hunt UBL in Tora Bora. Apparently throwing millions of dollars around in foreign countries doesnt always guarantee success--so the U.S. military went to war in Afghanistan. 

Back in the U.S., the Bush-Cheney War Criminals began covering up 9/11 by asking the Joint Congressional Inquiry into 9/11 NOT to investigate--in fact [Dick Cheney asked Tom Daschle NOT to investigate several times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePOIhhd9Jr0). The CIA, the FBI, the NSA all stonewalled the 9/11 Commission at every turn as well. In the end, the 9/11 Commission co-chairmen wrote a letter in the *NYT* accusing the [White House and the CIA of OBSTRUCTING the 9/11 investigation](http://www.salon.com/2008/01/02/obstruction/).

General Wesley Clark is also on the record stating the [Bush-Cheney War Criminals intended to go to War with 7 countries in 5 years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RC1Mepk_Sw). 

I dont know what exactly happened on 9/11--but I do know the U.S. government is LYING and the 9/11 Commission Report was a WHITEWASH. If you havent looked into any of these issues I would urge you do some research--because the USA seems to have become fixated on war. 

The list of countries the US has bombed and/or attempted to overthrow the government of since the end of WWII is most likely much longer than you think. Lately, I definitely worry that eventually the world is going to get sick of the US bullying its way around the globe with boots on the ground in over 100 countries.

 article was #1 in r/news, but we wouldnt want U.S. soldiers to question their fighting for democracy brainwashed mentality.

[LYING BY OMISSION](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Lying_by_omission) 




 WHY did the US go to war in Iraq? Was it because of Iraqi WMDs? Because of Iraqi connections to Al Qaeda? Because Saddam Hussein tried to assassinate GHW Bush? Or was it because Iraq had dropped the PETRO-DOLLAR in November, 2000? http://ftmdaily.com/preparing-for-the-collapse-of-the-petrodollar-system-part-3/ ...also see: General Wesley Clark (2 minutes): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RC1Mepk_Sw and...Scott Ritter with Seymour Hersh discuss Iraq (15 minutes): http://www.c-span.org/video/?c4499540/scott-ritter-claims-regime-change-us-policy-goal-towards-iraq-1990-2003 




 U.S. has literally HUNDREDS of military bases on foreign soil, Russia doesnt even have 20...

but yeah, Russia is the INVADER. 




 Thought this would be #1 on r/news--it did make it to #1 in [r/politics](http://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/2m3zdf/fbis_suicide_letter_to_dr_martin_luther_king_jr/)...

YES, J. Edgar Hoover is SUSPECT #1 in MLKs assassination.

YES, J. Edgar Hoovers name/likeness should be stripped off all federal buildings.

YES, it is an insult that this story wasnt run on the Front Page of our newspapers--but on Page 19.

YES, it is time to demand the FBI-CIA-NSA open up more files--especially the MLK-JFK-RFK assassination records. 




 CANT believe Thomas Drake cant find a publisher for his book...Thomas Drake is one of the few HEROS in the USA...turned down 600K from a private corporation--ended up getting charged by the USG, threatened with 35 years in jail, thrown into financial hell by the USG because he exposed their FRAUD. 

I wish there was a once a month videocast of 9/11 interviews of this caliber. 

Thank You, Thomas Drake.

 




 1. J. Edgar Hoovers BLACK MAIL Letter to Martin Luther King, Jr. which was just released by Beverly Gage (author and American History professor at Yale). She found it in the National Archives--the letter had been made public but it was heavily redacted.

 its definitely nice to be able to look over the docs first hand...pretty frustrating to see how redacted some of the files are still...i would encourage you to do a search (inside of 9/11 Document Archives files)...
you can also joggle between Popular and New (etc)...even search for terms like FBI or Larry Silverstein

 




 Seems like the corporate media CIA Wurlitzer is playing the usual One Note tune as well. 




 normally dont like radiocasts--but Thomas Drake is a great speaker--wish the USG didnt F him so bad...

FYI: I originally saw these posted on cryptome.org titled DoD Declassifies 9/11 Interview Documents (which is the same archive but sorted by New)

I posted [Notes from an interview with White House Deputy Chief of Staff Josh Bolten](http://www.scribd.com/doc/231427854/DH-B2-Josh-Bolten)--on page 4 it states that Dick Cheney gave the order to shoot down Flight 93, then verified it was shot down and called POTUS to let him know it was shot down.

In the comments for the Josh Bolten post, someone questioned where exactly all of these documents were coming from...the best answer was from u/pubestash:

I'm surprised this hasn't gotten more attention. Maybe its just assumed to be true here already but this is some strong evidence from official documents stating that 93 was shot down by Cheney.

These do look legit btw, here on [archives.gov](http://www.archives.gov/research/9-11/faqs.html) is the FAQ for the 9/11 commission documents and they say how NARA will be making these available online. The scribd profile is of those people scanning the documents.

 throughout the 1990s the UN conducted weapons inspections in Iraq which included satellite photos and input from intelligence agencies (CIA, Mi6, etc)...The US knew Saddam had nothing, yet the Bush-Cheney administration was salivating to go to war in Iraq. So they cooked up intelligence and Colin Powell went to the UN with a fake vial of uranium and some pentagon graphics of mobile WMD trucks...

 TIME to OPEN UP some more FBI-CIA-NSA files...Unredacted, of course. 




 Documents which define history should belong to the public, not private interests."

I would argue that all FBI-CIA-NSA files should be released unredacted no later than 8 years after creation. This would act as a deterrent to government officials abusing their power--and allow We, the People to know our true history. As taxpayers, we have also paid them to act in our interest and deserve to know the TRUTH. 




 I was surprised this wasnt the #1 news story of the day--glad it made it to #1 in r/politics...

Interesting that Beverly Gage (who found the uncensored letter) wrote a book in 2009 on the 1920 bombing of Wall Street. Even though almost 90 years had passed, Gage couldnt get the US government to release any new files. You would think a Yale history professor would have some connections...

Well, Im glad she scored big on this one...but Id love to see pressure for the release of more FBI-CIA-NSA files!!! 




 I also think its time to open up more FBI-CIA-NSA files!!!!!

Pretty depressing how often Obama has quoted MLK/JFK/RFK, yet he has failed to demand the release of their files...its almost like Obama forgot they all got WHACKED.

An interesting side note is that Beverly Gage wrote a book on the 1920 bombing of Wall Street--she couldnt get the US government to release any files...over 85 years later!!! 

[*The Day Wall Street Exploded*](http://www.amazon.com/The-Day-Wall-Street-Exploded/dp/0199759286) was first published in 2009 and included notes on sources in the back... 




 J. Edgar Hoover should be **SUSPECT #1** in MLKs death. 

Its also time to take J. Edgar Hoovers name off all federal buildings.

Army Intelligence first began spying on MLKs family back in 1917...the FBI opened their file on MLK in 1947.


 









 Maybe someday the soldiers will come to understand that they were sent to war in Iraq, Not for WMDs, Not for Iraqi connections to Al Qaeda, Not because Saddam Hussein had tried to whack GHW Bush--but because in November, 2000 Saddam Hussein had detached Iraq from the PETRO-DOLLAR.

**Saddam Turns His Back on Greenbacks
By William Dowell for TIME. Monday, Nov. 13, 2000**.

Europes dream of promoting the euro as a competitor to the U.S. dollar may get a boost from SADDAM HUSSEIN. Iraq says that from now on, it wants payments for its oil in euros, despite the fact that the battered European currency unit, which used to be worth quite a bit more than $1, has dropped to about 82[cents]. Iraq says it will no longer accept dollars for oil because it does not want to deal in the currency of the enemy.

The switch to euros would cost the U.N. a small fortune in accounting-paperwork changes. It would also reduce the interest earnings and reparations payments that Iraq is making for damage it caused during the Gulf War, a shortfall the Iraqis would have to make up.

The move hurts Iraq, the U.N. and the countries receiving reparations. So why is Saddam doing it? Diplomatic sources say switching to the euro will favor European suppliers over U.S. ones in competing for Iraqi contracts, and the p.r. boost that Baghdad would probably get in Europe would be another plus.

 They also have buildings which go [up 4 levels...and DOWN 12 floors](http://video.pbs.org/video/2365004424/).

The 9/11 Commission offices were also located in a CIA owned/managed building (source: Philip Shenon, *The Commission*)...wonder if they were SPIED ON by the CIA-NSA as well... 




 Has anything been done about the NSA spying on U.S. citizens? Have the upper brass at the NSA been read their rights? In the 70s, according to [James Bamford](https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/10/02/the-nsa-and-me/), the attorney general actually took this step. Interestingly enough, Bamford was also working with a secret 6,000 page document.

But my biggest battle with the NSA came before my book was even published. Without the agencys knowledge, I had obtained the criminal file that the Justice Department had opened on the NSA. Marked as Top Secret, the file was so sensitive that only two original copies existed. Never before or since has an entire agency been the subject of a criminal investigation. **Senior officials at the NSA were even read their Miranda rights**.

Obamas first words were basically Look forward, not back. So, NO...nothing will be done.
 




 [HERES](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1109052-senate-intelligence-report-list-of-cia-findings.html) the list that McClatchys news got in trouble for leaking...seems written with the intention of putting everyone to sleep. also troubling is the CIAs constant Propaganda Wurlitzer chiming in before the Torture Report even comes out. 




 CIA torture. The [U.S. military training Iraqis to torture](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/06/pentagon-iraqi-torture-centres-link). School of the Americas...CIA drug dealing from Italy in WWII to SE Asia to Nicaragua to Afghanistan...

The Pentagon swallowing Trillions of dollars since 9/11...shipping cargo jets filled with billions of dollars to Iraq--no receipt needed (just sign here...wink, wink). No wonder [the Pentagon wont submit to an audit](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/pentagon/#article/part2).

The CIA-FBI-ONI-Secret Service cant tell us who shot JFK, but they can sure keep hold of all those files!!!

They cant [release their 9/11 files](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/classified-pages-911-report-may-implicate-key-u-s-ally/), but they sure can spend those Billions upon Billions of dollars that rained down after [the towers exploded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUDoGuLpirc) on TV.

They cant tell if a country has WMDs or not, but they sure can jump into a useless war (and then extend it for a decade).

They couldnt find Usama bin Laden--even though they were paying the Afghan warlords millions and the Pakistanis billions.

They cant believe Americans would buy into this whole cascade of lies and willingly keep paying for more.

 














 Too much money to be made by WAR:

The [3.2 million employed by the Pentagon](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/post/the-department-of-defense-employs-1-percent-of-americans/2011/09/12/gIQAU6dTNK_blog.html) make money...

the weapons manufacturers make money...

the construction and industrial builders make money...

the energy companies make money...

the media companies make money...

the technology and software companies make money...

the transportation industry (airlines, trains, buses) makes money...

the medical device companies make money...

the pharmaceutical companies make money...

the lobbyists make money...

the bankers make money...

the attorneys make money...

the investors make money... 




 Furthermore, the 9/11 Commission Report contained at least 2 chapters which relied heavily on testimony of detainees gained using torture--which makes the evidence inadmissible. 

Once you consider the fact that the 9/11 Commission was initially funded with $3 million and 18 months to produce their report; and that the SSCI funded the Torture Report Summary with $40 million and allowed the CIA-approved attorneys 4 years to slice, dice and blackout the findings--now you might be able to understand what a WHITEWASH the 9/11 Commission was.

Call U.S. WAR, INC for an interview

 




 James Angleton, written off as a crank and a madman by his critics, had the hardest job in the CIA: keeping the enemy out. What he learned before his death was that we are our own worst enemy. 

When I ventured to his pleasant house in Arlington in late 1985, I found him coming to grips with this thought. I realize how I have wasted my existence, my professional life, he told me. He was not bitter--just uncomfortable with the thought. His entire being told him that his beloved intelligence community had been penetrated by the Soviets with agents of great skill. He understood why his colleagues in the CIA eventually grew tired of his mole hunts and his efforts to protect the place. I was always the skunk at the garden party, and even your friends tire of that, he said.

The last time I saw James Angleton, his face, always thinner than thin, had changed little, even though the cigarettes he would not give up had destroyed his lungs with cancer. The other cancer that was eating away at him was the suspicion and fear that came with his job. He was a man estranged by his career from his wife and children and dying in total emotional isolation.

Within the confines of his remarkable life were most of Americas secrets. You know how I got to be in charge of counterintelligence? I agreed not to polygraph or require detailed background checks on Allen Dulles and 60 of his closest friends. His monologue would stop only for a sip of tea or a violent fit of coughing. They were afraid that their own business dealings with Hitlers pals would come out. They were too arrogant to believe that the Russians would discover it at all. The real problem, Angleton concluded, was that there was no accountability. And without real accountability everything turned to shit.

All the trappings of Angletons legend were gone by this time, except for his love of exotic tea. But now, this man who had struck fear into most of his colleagues--the man who had been able to end a CIA career with a nod or a phone call--unassuming house seemed empty. You know, the CIA got tens of thousands of brave people killed...We played with lives as if we owned them. We gave false hope. We--I--so misjudged what happened.

I asked the old man dying how it all went so wrong. With no emotion in his voice, but with his hand trembling, Angleton replied: Fundamentally, the founding fathers of U.S. intelligence were liars. The better you lied and the more you betrayed, the more likely you would be promoted. These people attracted and promoted each other. Outside of their duplicity, the only thing they had in common was a desire for absolute power. I did things that, in looking back on my life, I regret. But I was part of it and loved being in it...Allen Dulles, Richard Helms, Carmel Offie and Frank Wisner were the grand masters. If you were in a room with them you were in a room full of people that you had to believe would deservedly end up in hell. Angleton slowly sipped his tea and then said, I guess I will see them there soon.

Angleton has been portrayed as a lunatic and even a torturer, and, as this book has documented, he did harm to many colleagues. However, I hope this book also clarifies who he really was and gives the reader a sense of the man whose lifes mission was to protect the CIA from the enemy. As he told me, Sometimes you can find the real enemy right in the mirror.

At the end, he seemed grateful for the release his lung cancer brought him. I am afraid whatever sins I have committed in my life, he said as he sipped his tea, have now come home to roost...I am fundamentally a failure. I failed to protect the CIA, because there was no real desire to secure the place from the Soviets. I never understood the great advantage the Russians had over us...As Americans we just hold no real value in secrecy. God, it was such a simple explanation.

If this was an average citizen who did this he would be charged with several different illegal acts--I hope the prosecutor increases the charges accordingly. 









 So WTF did McGovern do? He didnt even fucking enter the event--yet these thugs arrest him and pile on charges.

I rented one of these spaces from Gossett when I was a dispatcher working days or evenings. I paid Gossett $3.00 per month and was given a key to the lot. An interesting point is that the lot had an iron bar across the only entrance and exit (which were the same). The bar had a chain and lock on it. The only people having access to it were deputies with keys**."

 So, its not because the CIA is filled with psychopathic criminals who are willing to lie or kill to cover up their rampant 67 year crime spree??? 




 FYI: Even people who were on the 9/11 Commission have stated they were LIED to and [OBSTRUCTED by the White House](http://www.salon.com/2008/01/02/obstruction/) and the CIA. 

At least 2 chapters of the 9/11 cOmmission Report were based in large part on testimony gained via TORTURE--which makes the evidence" inadmissible.

Senator Bob Graham also wrote a book about how the investigation by the Senate-House Joint Intelligence Committee was never allowed to investigate fully due to Bush/Cheney/CIA/FBI foot dragging.

Anyone who has looked into the facts KNOWS that the CIA and the DIA both knew some of the hijackers were in the U.S. in January 2000--but both the DIA and the CIA failed to notify the FBI that there were al qaeda in the U.S. The DIA operation which identified the hijackers was called ABLE DANGER--both cbs and cnn ran stories on the program in August of 2005: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME0iKZdoYXs 









 So, McGovern is on a BOLO list for an arrest in which the charges were dropped...

FUCKING ridiculous.

Heres a question for Patreus: "Hey, Patreus--did the NSA OUT YOU from your CIA job...or was it your Pentagon comrades???"
 




 I guess so--it just seems to be happening more frequently...maybe reddit might give gold members preference at some point? 









 Just look at William Blums Table of Contents page from his book [*KILLING HOPE: U.S. Military and CIA Interventions since WWII*](http://williamblum.org/books/killing-hope#toc)

Most Americans simply are too brainwashed to understand our complicity in so many conflicts (and so many deaths) across the globe. Even today, the good ol U.S.A. has military or covert operations running in at least 132 countries. 

Two other excellent books to start out on would be *OVERTHROW: Americas Century of Regime Change from Hawaii to Iraq* by Stephen Kinzer and *LEGACY OF ASHES: The History of the CIA* by Tim Weiner. 

In terms of the surveillance state--theres a Frontline documentary called *Top Secret America* (2013) which gives a great look at the rapid expansion of the intelligence sector after 9/11...http://video.pbs.org/video/2365004424/

 the only other info on this document was this comment:

here on [archives.gov](http://www.archives.gov/research/9-11/faqs.html) is the FAQ for the 9/11 commission documents and they say how NARA will be making these available online. The scribd profile is of those people scanning the documents.

you can also see the whole stash of documents here: [DoD Declassifies 9/11 interview documents]

 Recently these 9/11 Commission notes came out...(declassified and placed online)...

White House Dep Chief of Staff Josh Bolten on 9/11: **Shortly after the VP confirmed the shootdown of 93, the VP placed a call to prez to let him know he did it**" (notes from interview, page 4)

 the 1998 movie *Enemy of the State* also has a 9/11 reference:  the criminal psychopath who runs the NSA...

 Bush couldnt even talk to the 9/11 Commission without Shrimp Dick Cheney going along to hold his hand. Neither were placed under oath, there were no notes allowed to be taken and it was considered an informal talk. 

But, yeah--Im sure they told the truth.

 "Those who can make you believe absurdities, can make you commit atrocities.

--Voltaire 




 The host was really trying his best to throw words into Russells mouth and stop him from finishing his points. when the host brought up 9/11 (out of the blue) I think he was just trying to bait him into making a statement which couldnt be logically discussed in the 3 minutes left on the show...so, Russell did a good job to sidestep the question by saying he is open minded on the subject. Im assuming Russell mentioned 9/11 in his book and the host wanted to drop that question in to make him look like a fool.

Russell did get one great line in: The time when people trust politicians--thats over, thats in the past." 




 I think the members of congress who questioned 9/11 were all railroaded out of office. 




 Peter Dale Scott addresses this issue in his articles, lectures and books:

----------------

In American history there are two types of events. There are ordinary events which the information systems of the country can understand and transmit. There are also deep events, or meta-events, which the mainstream information systems of the country cannot digest. I mean by a deep event one in which it is clear from the outset that there are aspects which will not be dealt with in the mainstream media, and will be studied only by those so-called conspiracy theorists who specialize in deep history.

 Russell handled him pretty well--he definitely stiff-armed a couple of questions and re-phrased them so he couldnt get painted in a corner...

If you havent seen it, the last time Russell was on bbc was worth a watch, too... 




 Atheists were much more likely to believe both republicans and democrats allow the CIA and the Pentagon to commit conspiracy after conspiracy--and then cover them up using crooked investigations and fake commissions. 




 Thanks for your work at ae911truth...just had a couple questions:

1. We know the WTC steel was quickly shipped off--much of it to be recycled in China and India--but, what were the most important pieces to analyze for a proper investigation? and what percentage of these pieces were investigators given access to? was WTC 7 handled the same as the Twin Towers? 

2. Wondering if you think the victims (and their families) have been silenced with a non-disclosure agreement which Feinbergs 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund may have contained...

**edit**: unfortunately, I wont be able to stick around for the AMA--hope someone can copy/paste these questions in the AMA...definitely will check it out later this afternoon...thanks to the mods and ae911truth--hope to see more AMAs in r/conspiracy!!! 




 theres still a lot of people coming round and realizing they have been lied to by the US government--NSA whistleblower William Binney just signed the ae911truth petition this year...(he did an interview on the Corbett Report with Richard Gage) 




 Even without the Torture Report, the evidence gained regarding 9/11 has already been tainted: 

--------------

And that the CIAs torture program ended up deceiving the 9/11 Commission. Specifically, the 9/11 Commission Report was largely based on third-hand accounts of what tortured detainees said, with two of the three parties in the communication being government employees. The 9/11 Commissioners were not allowed to speak with the detainees, or even their interrogators. Instead, they got their information third-hand. The Commission itself didnt really trust the interrogation testimony  yet published it as if it were Gospel.

New York Times investigative reporter Philip Shenon Newsweek noted in a 2009 essay in Newsweek: The 9/11 Commission appears to have ignored obvious clues throughout 2003 and 2004 that its account of the 9/11 plot and Al Qaeda's history relied heavily on information obtained from detainees who had been subjected to torture

 Theyll spend 6 years investigating--then pay $50 million to have CIA-approved attorneys shred the report down to under 500 pages...then release the watered-down version which omits the names and places... 




 I used to think Brand was an a-hole...now, I think he is respectable for the fact that he will speak his mind and doesnt just let the media run him over...Its just fucked that no one can mention 9/11 without a tear in their eye and a fucking flag wrapped around them. To question what exactly happened shouldnt be seen in a negative light. To be clear: the 9/11 question he largely just sidestepped--but it seems likely he wrote something in his book which definitely questions the Official Story.

9/11 was the Crime of the fucking Century--how many CSI and reality crime shows do people watch mindlessly every night? But to question real life crimes which actually matter is frowned upon because the media has brainwashed the citizens.

 WAR, INC Objective #1 is to stir up violence until it becomes necessary for an expanded U.S. military presence in Iraq. 

WAR, INC Objective #2 is for the U.S. military to expand its role into Syria--which will lead to Regime Change. (Insert U.S.-friendly Puppet Dictator here).
