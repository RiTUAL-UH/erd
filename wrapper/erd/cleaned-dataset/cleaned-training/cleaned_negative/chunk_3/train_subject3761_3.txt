 I can't upvote this enough.  




 I don't have to listen to you and your anarchy. 




 I wouldn't mind...it might actually be interesting seeing how this happens. The biggest of my concerns is the flags. They might just change the meaning of 50 stars is they're lazy enough.  




 _ So happy! No more grown men arguing like little girls! 




 Maximum health. And a bad ass cape.

 Well, Obama's got reddit's vote. He did an AMA *and* is encouraging us [to exit our internet hidey holes] to vote! 




 We find out in another story...he was crushed by a giant shipment of oranges and ladies in white dresses. 
Edit: I accidentally a word. 




 It's not filler nor canon. It's an extra. That's all. Fillers are put in just the anime, yet manga extras can still be in there, just not part of the plot. Fillers can end up being more relevant than extras.  




 I learned that trick from reddit-thank you for saving me from trying to use it and leaving someone with a hot, soapy, shit soup in their toilet.  




 I just literally say 'etc' if I have to because I can never remember how to say it.  




 Sent an email...got one back quickly. I let the conversation escalate before I commented though.

*Not sure where I should go with this conversation now. *
 




 This is quite an awesome build. I downloaded the world to get a better look. It's fantastic! 




 I've woken up right before my alarm and in my sleep induced drunk, I started panicking, wondering if I downloaded the right texture pack the previous night so I could get dressed, and then proceeded to look for my laptop in the bathtub. I wish I had a good excuse for that.  




 YES! Glad he won! 




 Thanks! 




 This takes patience and skill that I simply do not have. I applaud you.  




 I'm not Hispanic, but I'm rather advanced in Spanish. When I read things out loud I use proper pronounciation and accent, but there's always that idiot that says "stop acting Mexican!". So I have to dumb it down to heavy r's and d's.  




 The hill I go snowboarding at has a conveyor lift listed on the bunny hill. It must be new this year, since last year there were only ropes. Is this an actual conveyor belt for snowboarding/skiing? 




 WE NEED UPDATES!!! Unless you're dead...then that would be crazy...or this just annihilated the ending. Or Rose hacked him. Fuck...now I'm overthinking nosleep. 




 My radio likes to turn on on its own. All it does is make loud, irritating, static. Usually I don't mind...sometimes I'm even too lazy to get up and turn it off. When it does this in the middle of Rose's dialogue, I can't help but throw things at it in fear.  




 I am a native speaker and I thought that was a saying.  




 Repost of something posted 12 days ago.  




 Marilyn Manson. Horrible live.  




 Well that's a lot of nope!  




 How much are they?  




 Thank you for living a dream for those of us who stay in internet caves.  




 The curl and Gilbird says it all.  




 If I didn't know any better I would say she was a Hetalia fan. 




 Fuck cleanliness too.  




 Ugh..that's going to take a while...I guess that's payback for derping up. Thanks! 




 I accidentally changed my spawnpoint...twice. The first time I tried the command, I thought it would take me to my spawnpoint. Since I didn't go anywhere, I tried it again thinking I entered it wrong. Turns out, I changed my spawn point twice. Is there any way I can reverse this? (I'm in a superflat and have been searching the Nether for my portal. Haven't had any luck with that..) 









 One of the features of the update says that Herobrine was removed. Is Mojang trolling us or was Herobrine actually there? 




 ^_^ 




 Then a membership is definitely something I'm willing to invest in. Thanks! 




 If you have an Underground membership, can you download all of the previous CDs/order them? (LP8 is the best!) 




 "Oh shit...didn't they do that thing with Jay-z?"
Or
"Faggots. Why do you listen to that screamy emo shit?"
OR 
"FUCK YEEEEEEEEEEAH!" 




 I like guys who are just a bit too socially awkward than expected...not necessarily the type to sit at a computer all day, but more of the kind that's almost too shy to say hi to random people. (And OP's quirk: awesome.) 




 The other one is Project Diva~ 




 Would love to...but, there's a bit of an ocean in the way. But a meetup would be awesome! 




 Same here over in Wisconsin...the snow cam is so uneventful. 














 I know Hatafutte Parade, Mein Gott, Absolutely Invincible British Gentleman, and Excuse me, I'm Sorry were performed, but I'm wondering if there were any others as well.  




 I always tell people my dreams if they're interesting; and I hate being a hypocrite. But when people tell me about how 'demonic' or 'dark' their dream was, I usually get irritated. The only thing more irritating is when my friend tells me she doesn't dream and when she does it's a sign that something bad will happen and she should stay home and watch TV that day. 




 Do you get your period on both? And if so, at the same time? 




 We broke another website...overloaded. 




 Not all of them are wrapped in the plastic. I've seen them at bookstores open; they expect everyone to be mature and buy it or pirate the ebook before reading it in public. 




 I was wondering that too....it just disappeared. Nothing with 20000+ points just disappears. 




 We have a bunch of those in our science classroom. They're not plugged in though... 




 Found it again! 









 Yet the textbooks at my school are falling apart... 




 You lucky lucky female you,  




 It was! I could fly across it at a point. I took out my compass trying to find my way back to my spawn point. It told me my spawn point was right next to the huge thing! So I was dumb enough to fall out of the world...no such luck. Maybe I'll be lucky enough to come across something like that again. There were even diamonds in the caves! 




 There's trees on top too-a whole biome! 














 If someone took my bike like that, I wouldn't even be mad. They obviously deserve it more than me.  









 Licorice. It seems the whole planet loves it, and thinks Twizzlers are the best candy in the world, but I just can't seem to see how it tastes so fantastic.  




 Thanks!
 




 Okay, this seems like a really dumb question, but I was wondering if Minecraft had to be updated for anvils to be available, since I can't craft them.  




 I have that printer...it sucks shit. Can't even print out a simple document without screwing up.  




 My friend can't remember anything. It annoys the living hell out of me when she can't remember plans or something but can remember anything science and math related. If I hadn't met her brother, I would think she was full of shit. Even though sometimes I do anyways... 




 "Rowling would not rule out another book set in Voldemort-ville. But as far as "Harry's story is concerned," Rowling said, "I'm done." This is the part of the article that makes me excited.  




 What is your favorite bath and body works scent? How often do you use calculators?

Well this is a fine discovery.  




 Buy Lucky Charms (cereal).  




 Sometimes I'll be looking through a photo album and she just drifts across the page. It definitely livens things up!
 




 Pinkie's~ 




 Most certainly! 




 What's your favorite kind of chicken? (My friend's been wondering.) 









 That's Soundwave before he was copyrighted as such. 




 No problem!

 Posted! 









 In science, some kid started to explain how retarded it was that we had to study paramecium. Someone decided to reply with "Don't say retarded you fucking fag!" 




 Most certainly! 




 I am honestly impressed with this website; It has tracks from extremely well known artists to artists from overseas. Even character songs! This is definitely going into my favorites~! 




 So...I guess we broke another website.  




 The bubble wrap bag things came with Vault. I was so excited when I saw the package! 




 Whelp, I'm done eating for life.  




 But they're still sending deaf students to a concert...
