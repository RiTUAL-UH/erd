 It is highly dubious as to wether Hitler really did have one testicle, it has never been conclusively proven and frankly it does sound like propoganda to me. However, Herman Goering was shot in the testicles during the Beer Hall, or Munich Putsch in 1923 and as a result became addicted to morphine for the rest of his life.

Also Chairman Mao, China's 'Communist' leader (lets call a spade a spade, China is a Fascist state regardless of what they call themselves) suffered from an undescended testicle.

There seems to be a pattern doesn't there, fascist dictators tend to have one ball. Makes you wonder what Mussolini's package consisted of. 




 As with any new medicine, the idea of a vaccination (curing one decease by infecting another) was met with great distrust. [Here is a contemporary cartoon](http://imgur.com/ar3Bu) showing just how much people were afraid of getting vaccinated when it was first introduced. Edward Jenner (the discoverer of the smallpox vaccine) is the man standing in the middle of the cartoon. 




 I (along with the rest of the non-american western world) find it truly and deeply disturbing that this is such a prevalent view taken by Americans, and that apparently some people in the states can't tell the difference between a high-powered military-grade assault rifle and a baseball bat. There is ***NO*** justification for such a weapon to be available to the public, no rational reason whatsoever. If you want a gun for personal protection, get a pistol or two and place it in a lock box somewhere strategic in your home. If you want a high powered rifle, join the military or just grow up and be satisfied with the penis you were born with.

If you zoom in far enough you can actually see climbers, albeit climbing the glacier not the actual mountain.

For those interesting this is taken from Kalar Pathar and the new Everest Base Camp is along the bottom of the picture, under the Glacier. Everest is the peak on the left, half hidden behind a closer peak and Lohtse is the peak to the right of Everest, which is the 4th highest mountain in the world!

 Apparently it was very old glass (some of it 15cm thick) and it ruptured due to age and very cold weather. The tank contained 33 tons of water along with several animals such as sharks, turtles and rays (plus 3 lemon sharks which can grow to 10 feet in length). All the animals died and 16 people were injured, although none seriously.

'Melanie Laurent -En T'Attendant'

It's hard to define what genre this is, its the Damien Rice end of large ensemble folk music (Rice guests on the album on a few tracks). A lot of the album is french language so I have no idea what the songs are about a lot of the time, but the music is wonderful! [Here is a link to the title track.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwb8hXlUE1E)


Fun fact: Melanie Laurent is the actress who played Shoshanna in Inglorious Basterds. She is also a great musician apparently!

 The infancy of humanity. The inability to explain natural phenomena and disease. The very apparent and totalitarian presence of death, for 99% of humanities existence it was uncommon to live past 30. Consider just how much the world has changed in the past 200 years, and bare in mind humans have existed for anywhere between 100-250 million years. We are at this time in history *just* learning to open our eyes, only now after so much time are these issues, that dominated the life of every human being for millions of years, are being addressed. How is it possible to unquestionably see that this *is* the nature of religion? Simple, just look at the prolific nature of religion. There are or have been as many completely different and varied religious groups are there are grains of sand on a beach, all of them designed to offer the same explanations for the various blights of humanity.  Humans for many years *needed* religion to explain the hostile nature of the world. Now we need Doctors. 




 Brilliant one. If you think about it long enough it starts to make sense, for example it makes sense for a primitive creature to react to pain, it is something else for an animal to *avoid* pain. Deep waters indeed. 




 One day literally everyone alive today will be dead. The sun will rise and it will be completely normal day, but *everyone* that is alive now will no longer exist, and for many of us it will simply be like we never existed.

 When I reached the peak of a Himalayan mountain. It wasn't a big one, it wasn't even snowcapped, but I climbed that bastard on my own, in Converse and after an 18 day trek with a 22KG backpack on in very low oxygen. From the top I had a view of a valley with two incredible mountain ranges on either side (one of which happened to be Lhotse and Everest) all to myself. That ladies and gentlemen, is euphoria.

 This is what is know as a 'backronym', all expressions (such as '*save our souls*' etc.) being invented to fit the pre-existing acronym.

The same can be said of the original distress call 'CQD', which is a combination of the original distress call of 'CQ' ('*scu*' from the French word *scurit*), then the D was added latter to stand for '*Distress*'. A common myth is that CQD stands for '*Come Quick: Danger*'.

SOS replaced CQD as the official morse distress signal in the early part of the 20^th Century and played a role in the sinking of Titanic, as there is a story that as Titanic sank the radio operators were signalling SOS rather than CQD, and no one understood that SOS was a distress call. This is probably a myth, but still interesting. 




 By coincidence, it was watching that episode that lead me to researching the subject where I came across this photo! 




 Princip provided the spark. It is probable, perhaps certain that war would have broken out eventually, however this event sent into motion a chain of events that caused the most catastrophic consequences in human history. The entire world was rocked by two World Wars and the modern world shaped by the outcome. And it all started with two gunshots, and one man. 




 Apologies, the title is not quite accurate as a different type of bomb was dropped over Hiroshima. The Trinity test and Nagasaki bomb were implosion devices while the Hiroshima bomb was a gun-type atomic bomb. Regardless, this pictures shows the first ever detonation of a nuclear weapon. The black specs along the horizon are trees. To imagine it puts a chill through the bones. 




 Regardless, this was still the first nuclear detonation of any atomic weapon. I don't think its possible to edit Hiroshima out of the title is it? 









 Bourbon. I am a musician and recently recorded a new EP (I'm not famous before anyone asks, pretty much do it for myself and my work) and got through a Litre of Jack by the end of the recording process. Probably not healthy, but productive!

 No, that was the first attempted assassin, Nedeljko abrinovi, not Princip. After abrinovi's failed attempt Ferdinand (after stopping at Sarajavo Town Hall) took a different route to the cities hospital (where he was initially going) but the driver took a wrong turn and braked so as to reverse the car. By coincidence, this was only a few feet away from Princip (who was one of 10 assassins involved in the plot to kill Ferdinand), who took his chance and fired twice into the car, killing both Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophia (although she was not intended as a target). He was instantly arrested, which is when this photo was taken. He died in Jail three years later due to complications after his arm was amputated due to tuberculosis, probably caused by a poorly fixed broken bone in his arm from when he was arrested in Sarajevo.  




 I am not entirely sure who the photographer was, it is pretty self explanatory though. It was taken moments after the assassination, Princip is the man without a hat on the right, he attempted to shoot himself immediately after shooting Ferdinand but the gun was wrestled from him. [Here is a wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Archduke_Franz_Ferdinand_of_Austria) 




 Google 'The Bilderberg Group'. You may find it interesting. 




 Communism is a tough one to say whether it works or not, hence why there is still so much discourse on the subject even today. The trouble seems to be that all modern countries that identify themselves as communist are simply Fascist states, for example North Korea and China, though they declare themselves communist in principal (I am generalising of course and including Marxist-Lenninist politics) they can not be identified as anything but fascist. Most people seem to agree that the problem with communism is it grants too much power to too few people, as in North Korea, China and Stalinist Russia. Not to say Communism, or something close to it, can't work. Cuba is doing just fine! 









 The day will come when everyone who posts in this thread and who reads this comment will be dead, it is inevitable. Furthermore, the day will come, a long time from now but eventually the sun will rise on this world and everyone, yes everyone, alive now will be dead. But the world will keep spinning, the species will keep going, and it will be like we never existed at all.

 Hi, sorry for the late reply!

Yeah I just travelled with one backpack, the trick is to travel as light as possible, which gives you a lot more freedom to move around! I also took a guitar, but that's just because I cant go without! You don't need to travel with a laptop, its very easy almost everywhere to get online and to access computers, and a laptop is just one more thing to get broken or stolen. As far as what equipment, I'm not really sure what you mean? I didn't use any specialist equipment really, it's important to take a good and well supplied medical kit and my trusty iPod, but thats about it!

Cheap is a relative term, cheap compared to what I (being english) am used to may be reasonably priced in some places. I did get in a few scrapes but nothing *TOO* hairy, the trick is to be very smart and self-aware. You learn this quick enough, especially travelling alone. The trick is to not look like you are a person of any interest, there is a real art to being able to blend into a crowd and not catch anyones eye. If you look uncomfortable, scared or overconfident or in any way affluent you will be a target for trouble! If you look like you are in control and not-to-be-fucked-with, you will have no troubles! 




 Don't worry, I'm sure this isn't going to be standing over your bed. 




 I travelled solo around the world. I fell of a motorbike in Nepal, got a concussion from falling of a skateboard in New Zealand, trekked the Himalayas alone and got AMS (very deadly if not addressed) and had to turn back but almost broke my ankle, which would have been guaranteed death. I swam with sharks (without meaning to) and once nearly got bitten by a cobra in Vietnam. Oh, and there was also the time my bus was nearly attacked by men with AK-47s in Laos.

This is all true by the way and I have photos of most of this to prove it!

 This might seem like a strange one, but countries would certainly not exist if the everyone thought like me. After all, what is a country but another reason to form prejudice, wether positive or negative, over a perfect stranger. Try to image in it: No war, no dispute in the middle east, no conflicting militaries, no unrepresentative governments, no taxes, no restrictions upon travellers, no ruling class, no dictatorships, no reason to hate a person you have never met (other than religious grounds, but lets leave /r/atheism where it is). This is not to say that local cultures, languages, traditions and customs should be abandonded or assimilated, they should not. This is more akin to allowing people to be governers of their own destiny, and to not be collateral in political affairs. This, in my most humble opinion, is where Marx went wrong.

 Fair enough, I wasn't sure where that money came from, although it is certain that is was money given for earthquake relief, that was spent on illegal whaling. Specifically it was mostly spent I believe to repair the Nisshin Maru, the main whaling factory ship. 

I was talking to the first mate when I visited the ship yesterday and apparently they suspect the Japanese of using satellites to track the Sea Shepherd ships, which again is hugely expensive obviously. 




 For those who don't know, this is the Bob Barker, one of [Sea Shephard](http://www.seashepherd.org/)'s four vessels. It is in port in Wellington before heading to the Antarctic to prevent the Japanese ([who spent $30 million of aid given to them after the earthquake to fund illegal whaling](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/14597y/til_japan_used_30_million_of_their_tsunami_relief/)) from illegally hunting and killing whales. All on board are volunteers, and all on board are heroes.

 That was just how much *I* spent, and bare in mind I circumnavigated the entire globe so most of that pricetag was on plane tickets. Every trip has a different price, it depends what you do! 




 I have never done the Appalachian Train and don't know much about it so can't really give you a great deal of advice I'm afraid. I will say though that in my humble opinion real explorer spirit dwells in having the balls to leave your own comfort zone. From an outsiders perspective (I am not American, I was raised in England and have just emigrated to New Zealand) it seems that most Americans don't seem to have any interest in international travel, which is a huge shame if you don't mind me saying! If you are serious about wanting to experience some real adventure, blaze your own trail instead of sticking to the same old path that all the squares have strolled along before you, be your own explorer! You can do this on any budget, if you have a bit of spare cash though I recommend you take a trip to perhaps either South America or the Indian sub-continent, there is a lot of adventure to be had there, and you can feel free to ask me for any advice! Happy planning! :)

 I have been, the water isn't very clear but very deep in places. It is likely that there is a a large body of submerged rock under there though as it is a flooded landscape so all the cliffs slope inwards under the water (you can see the erosion where the cliff used to slope into the water)

 Sure! When can you leave?  




 No I don't want to give the impression the women can't travel in India alone, I know many who do! Its just that you have to be prepared for what to expect, if you are already seasoned traveller you will know what I mean. India has a lot to offer, but has a lot you need to be wary of, but definitely worth seeing, regardless who you are! 




 I didn't plan much before I left on purpose, to give me more freedom when I was there, just where my flights would go and how long on each continent. 

Most essential items, hmm, good question! 

Most essential would be the passport, obviously! I kept it on me at all times, 24/7.

Second most would be my iPod, there's a lot of boredom and sitting on buses involved in travel, I would have gone crazy several times over without my trusty ipod! 

Third, my medical kit. It took up the most room by far in my backpack and I used everything in there!

Fourth, my camera! When you are seeing that much awesome every day you need a decent camera, I actually only bought one after I had already been travelling for a few months, but still got some awesome pictures!

Fifth. hmm, I didn't have that much stuff! I would say my diary. Keeping a diary is a surprisingly rewarding thing to do while travelling, and my travel book is now my most treasured possession! 




 How's fifth grade going? 




 Haha, cheers! You are my hero to! All told it cost around 6-7000 GBP, that's not bad going for such a big trip, but it can be done a lot cheaper, all depends what you do! 




 I spent about 6-7000 GBP all told, which isn't bad going for such a long trip! I planned and booked my flights in advance, but thats it. I booked a place to stay in USA and when I arrived in a new western city like Auckland or Brisbane, but other than that I just showed up in a new town or city and sorted out food or accommodation when I was there! Its often the best and cheapest way of doing it, although not for everyone as there is always the chance you might not get somewhere.

Ways to save money: The big ones are eating and sleeping cheap, the other best way to save your pennies is use local transport, as appose to tourist transport. You will find that in many places like Asia or India there are plenty of cosy, pricey travel options like flights and nice buses that are for tourists. However there is always local transport for local people, its usually pretty basic and more often than not cramped and uncomfortable, but its cheap and you meet interesting people! The only other way of saving money is to not spend it on silly things like souvenirs and day trips and so on.
