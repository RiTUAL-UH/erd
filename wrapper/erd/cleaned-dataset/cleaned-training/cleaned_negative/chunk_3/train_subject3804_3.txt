 Not really scary as much as comforting. 

Mike reminded me of Danny DeVito as Owen in "Throw Momma From the Train"  




 Effects like that happen in a queue. It's odd, but a great mechanic to learn to be pro. Pretty much first effect play, first effect resolved. When you played Shadow Madness first, it had to resolve  before Power Overwhelming. However, Power Overwhelming triggers at the end of the owner's turn, so when owner's switched the effect stayed.
