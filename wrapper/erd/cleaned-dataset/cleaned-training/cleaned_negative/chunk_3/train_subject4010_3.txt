 Wake in Fright is absolutely fantastic and everybody should see that film. 

It's got one of my favourite moments of sound design, where there's nothing but the rumble of the engine as the party is driving back home after the kangaroo hunt.

Just fantastic. 




 I got a lot of respect for Robert Rodriguez. His work ethic and his skills across multiple areas of filmmaking are just... I mean, a guy who writes, directs, edits, produces, scores and even helps with the visual fx on his films. That's a lot of passion and love for his craft right there.

Just look at his credits on imdb for his own films. Nuts.

Edit: AND lights them too. A guy who totally deserves the title of maverick.
