 Yes, I'm sorry. 




 I once wrote a 15,000 page story 3 separate times, in first, second, and third person respectively. Finally I realized that I liked it best in third person, but that I needed to rewrite it AGAIN. I think in the end, I kept about 100 words of the roughly 50,000 I initially wrote. 

The silver lining is that the story thrived from the endless editing, and is now a published piece of fiction.  









 Not to mention some of these folks aren't even alive.  









 I've been waiting to read this book for months. So it's worth it? 




 Ahhhhh 




 John Keats is a poet from 200 years back. He's an interesting guy, and Hyperion gets its namesake from one of his poems. This book takes a VERY interesting twist on him. 

Also, the book is chronological.  




 Ayn Rand is a wizard with a plot, but her writing is grueling. 

Ender's Shadow is brilliant, as well as the entire Hegemon series. I have a sneaking suspicion you'll be hearing a lot more about this book after November hits.  




 The first book is about a pilgrimage to an abandoned planet, and each of 7 chapters is told by a different pilgrim. Each subsequent book takes a different narrative approach, but all of the characters remain the same. On a side note, if you're at all a John Keats fan, this is a can't miss.  




 Bright Lights, Big City.  




 Hyperion by Dan Simmons.  




 Check out Hyperion by Dan Simmons. It's a 4 book series that runs through about 7 narrators, but each of them have a compelling story and they all come together flawlessly. One of the best (and most underrated) series around.  









 Isn't this why fan fiction exists? 




 I love this guy's swagger.  




 Never been but would love to share a meal with you.  




 Long live Chauncey. Mitch, have you ever eaten at his restaurant in Colorado? 




 Happy cake day! 




 I'm still rooting for the Celtics.
