 He looks a lot like [Barsad from The Dark Knight Rises](http://i.imgur.com/Opapm.jpg) 









 That wasn't him being offended. That was him thinking over the joke you just said. Hence the 'hmm.'

I don't think all religious people are as easily offended as you think they are. 




 Another person replied to you talking about how Lasers basically sounds like the studio made the album for him. It's because they did. Lupe Fiasco was in a legal battle with Atlantic for about a year or so before they would even let him release Lasers because of their disagreements over what should be on it. Lupe himself has not only admitted, but spoken out on his dislike for Lasers. 

I went to a concert of his about a year before Lasers came out, and it was a concert actually promoting the then-expected album. The T-shirts for the tour had something called 'The Lasers Manifesto' written on the back. Look it up if you have the time, because it really is a nice message to see on the back of the shirt other than just the tour dates.

Basically, Lupe hated his own album, and promised his fans that the next one will be what both he and the fans wanted. 

And with that, I ask you to listen to his newest album: Food and Liquor II. It'll definitely change your mind on whether he's still an amazing lyricist or not.

 How the fuck do you remember your username. 




 HEY PAUL

 I think it's time we have a toast.

Let's have a toast for the real terrorists out there: a toast to the conservative talk radio hosts that fill the minds of idiots up with ideologies that every brown skinned turban-wearing citizen in our country is out to destroy our beautiful country. Thank you, again, for setting more people out there to act like dogs on their unjustified hatred for people who don't look, dress, or live the same way they do. They couldn't have done it without your help. 




 I'll post mine. [J. Robert Oppenheimer's commentary, after having witnessed the destruction his atomic bomb can cause, is short and powerful.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8H7Jibx-c0) I can't imagine what he felt at that moment. 




 I'm not asking for a video based simply on gore or shock value. I'm also not necessarily asking for something that can find itself onto an episode of Ghost Hunters. I want you guys to post a video that truly hit you to the core; something that made you realize how destructive and scarred people can make the world, or themselves. 




 OP here. This was posted on Facebook by one of my friends in Jordan. Even he thought this was ridiculous for what he usually sees. I'm a Pakistani-American myself so I tend to see some crazy drivers over there as well. 

But this.. uh. 




 You must be a really cheerful guy in person.

Oh, and the person that shot this picture took it in Jordan. Your shallow comments shouldn't even offend anyone because you obviously have no clue what you're talking about. 









 Are you sure you're not just listening to the preview? The song's over 8 minutes in length.. 




 Are you sure you're not just listening to the preview? You do realize the song is over 8 minutes in length, right..? 




 Oh hey! Something else I had no earthly clue existed until a Redditor brought attention to it! 




 Whenever I get impatient about something and someone says something along the lines of "Don't worry, just wait.", I instinctively cut them off with "I DID MY WAITING. TWELVE YEARS OF IT.


IN **AZKABAN**." 




 It's 5:44 AM, and I'm laughing more than I should have been when I got to Schumacher. 




 ...Well, fuck you too! 









 If you want to be rest assured with how much difference there can be between the quality of a movie and it's poster, take a look at these two:

 I wanna feel Joseph Gordon Levitt.

 So we'll hunt him. 




 WHAT DID EVERYONE SAY? 




 Hey, um.. TL;DR. 




 This isn't Twitteritis. Please don't post your daily activitoses here.

 Guys, let's focus on the game here. 




 This is a bit late, but I'm the guy that originally wrote this picture. The original post is in my username history. Yeah, it's Plano, Texas. 




 It's like DanielOnFilm said in this thread. Pixar's characters have identity. It's not sound editing, or anything being extra done by the voice cast. The characters are simply written brilliantly. 

I'm the other way around because of it. I can't watch any other Tom Hanks movie without thinking about Woody in the middle of Omaha Beach or trying to capture Leonardo DiCaprio. 




 (Dat mean he luv her moar den 4eva) 




 JUST STAY OFF THE SET YOU FUCKING PRICK. 




 Yep, that was my intention. Somewhat of a remake of that storyline. I've given it more of a Middle-Eastern/South Asian influence to replace the Irish influence given in the Scorcese movie.

Thanks! 




 Thank you! Working on it. 









 Into the West - Howard Shore and Annie Lennox. I'm pretty sure it's the only song to ever have made me cry. 




 Out of all the changes that have happened in the time between the release of *Blink-182* and *Neighborhoods*, what was/still is one of the hardest things to deal with personally and professionally for you as a band member and as a friend?


And thank you for giving me the soundtrack to my youth and more than I can say. 




 Fuck 




 Inna lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji'oon. I hope her family pulls through this with as much ease as possible. 




 WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? MR FREEZE WASN'T EVER IN A BATMAN MOVIE.  




 You're the exact kind of person I intend to make sure my kids never grow up to be. 




 Gotham. Come nightfall, Bale's city is mine. And anyone who's in it plays by my rules. 




 Oh, and obligatory Salam handshake from another Muslim college kid. :) 




 I just choked on a Samoa from seeing Christian bale in a hijab. Thank you.  




 yes 




 Lmao Jeremy 




 Still seems more enjoyable than the Crystal Skull.. 




 See post taking off for Karmastan.

Think of something clever to board flight.

Think nothing
Bear pun 




 I'm 19 now. I've been playing the piano for 11 years. The first couple years or so, I always told people how much I love playing the Plano. 




 I know who you're talking about too. I FEEL SO EMPOWERED.
