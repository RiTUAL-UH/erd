 Death is coming for us all, man, woman, and child... 

The Fyllid traveled 10 million light years to reach our world, to harvest the blood of the creatures they planted here long ago, in the age before recorded history. Those creatures began as simple-minded apes, but have now evolved into a society.

They'll be expecting no resistance. Let's be sure to give them one hell of a fight!

 Does anyone know of any web shows, preferably on youtube, where the focus is improvisation, that uploads content on a regular basis? 




 Before time itself existed, in the great cosmic sea, there was one lonely Oyster. That oyster opened it's mouth to reveal a shining pearl. That pearl was the first star.

 The Cat in the Hat slid his spiny penis into her tender pussy.

He raked the walls of her vagina and it hurt... it hurt so much... but that's how she liked it... When the Cat neared climax, he asked her, in a soft, panting, purring voice:

"Where would you like me to cum? ...I could cum on your tit, I could cum on your clit.... I could cum in your hair, or I could cum over there.... I could cum on your face, hell, I could cum *any* place!"

 I get what you're trying to say, but a remix is just something that uses the actual work but adds or changes it a little. For a parody, you would have to reproduce the music (thus, the imitation) AND change the lyrics. Neither that nor a parody are abstract concepts, they're pretty clear.

But remixes can be protected under fair use as well, as long as they meet certain government standards, unfortunately, one of the requirements is that it can't be done for profit without permission 




 No they cannot! That is the goddamn point! You can't sing small portions OR large portions! I'm not spamming, people like you just keep refusing to do any research! Fair use is clearly defined by law and that is not someone's opinion!

If you need different links, I can provide you with some, none of which you can't find yourself on google, but I assure you that they will all say the same thing. Here's one that debunks that weird '30 second rule' that people throw around. (one you probably believe, which is why you seem so adamant on your factually disproven position)

http://studentpressblogs.org/nspa/the-non-existent-30-second-rule/ 




 No, then they are **commenting** on the other target. Parody just means a piece of writing, music, etc., that imitates the style of someone or something else in an amusing way.

If they were 'parodies of the other target' then they would be imitating THAT target. Parody doesn't mean 'make fun of' even though it is usually a requirement to achieve effect.

I can reproduce the music and melody but change the words to, for example, "I'm Coming Undone" by Korn to "I'm cumming on Jon" and it would be considered a parody, even though I'm not commenting on the song itself. 

Not every parody has to be a Bart Baker video where you literally just trash the artist for the duration of their song 




 Why do you think they are protected legally? 

They aren't 'false claims.'

They performed songs on record without the rights. You can't do that, they can't do that, random people on youtube can't do that.

It is called INFRINGING! It is illegal and it puts their business in jeopardy!  

Take a moment to actually READ this, and I suggest you do the same for other topics before posting and perpetuating a misconception:

http://www.songrights.com/infringe.htm 




 For the same reason there are movies and other copyrighted works on youtube. Youtube can't police everything all the time when hours of content are uploaded every minute.

Just because people do it doesn't mean it's legal 




 In case you see this, Suzy:

We love you!

 




 Even if the videos aren't monetized, it's still illegal to perform a song without the rights 




 No. It's a legal thing. Maker is trying to cover the Grumps' seven asses against copyright infringement claims.


http://www.songrights.com/infringe.htm 




 Parodies don't have to be focused on the original work. It's perfectly okay to make fun of another target. 

Weird Al for example, I can't think of an instance other than that Nirvana song where his work commented on the original 




 It should end with a T-Shirt Commerical.

The shirt being advertised says "Gone Grumps" 




 True, the parody solution is the only viable one they have, even if they just change the last line. (They could re-upload those episodes with the singing parts edited to parody songs, or just censor them out)

I even posted this suggestion a few weeks back and a few morons decided to comment about how evil Maker is for taking the videos down (despite just protecting the channel by doing so) and that anyone can sing covers, yadayada. I deleted it because I didn't feel like debating with a bunch of stupid fucks. (Hardly a debate if it's fact vs opinion) I feel like too often on the subs I have to correct misconceptions a lot of people have over the business side of entertainment.

But man, everything I hear about Australia makes it sound so much better than America 




 People who hate Suzy and people who don't know how a business functions seem to be so adamant about this.

Everyone else either doesn't care or silently disagrees with the creepy fucks (and trust me, that 'everyone else' is exponentially higher than the vocal minority) 




 and hopefully the Grumps will unlock him and he'll be a special guest soon (and periodically in the future) 




 A couple of creepy fucks did a creepy fuck thing to try to prove that Suzy is Super-Hitler or something.

Over something that doesn't even involve Game Grumps.

Seriously, this fanbase... wow... 




 There is an actual legal problem, it's that singing songs you don't have the rights to is copyright infringement.

http://www.songrights.com/infringe.htm

A lot of people here have a misconception about this, thinking it's something covered under fair use, but that would only work if Game Grumps was a review show (and reviewing the song in question)

While youtube's automated "third-party content" detector does suck, they can repeal false claims. But if they get flagged with proof that they infringed on someone's song sitting right square in the middle of the video, it won't go over well for them.

I know it seems unfair and I know you see it everywhere on youtube, but it is illegal to perform cover songs without permission. (And, you'd be surprised to see how many covers have been flagged and now all the ad revenue goes toward the copyright holder) 




 no you cannot

http://www.songrights.com/infringe.htm

edit: Lol, I got downvoted for posting a fact. God, this sub is stupid 




 You can't sing songs for 10 seconds, 5 seconds, not even 2 seconds (if you can even fit it in that short of a time)

It's copyright infringement and that has the potential to get them flagged, which puts their business in jeopardy.

Just because you see people on youtube doing cover songs does NOT mean it's legal. You also see people post clips of movies they don't own.

 it wasn't the fanbase. It was the subreddit. The subreddit is full of shitty people.

The existence of ventgrumps and conspiracygrumps is proof of that 




 Yeah, but what if Jon lives in another city? Like, all the way across the country?

Man, that'd suck wouldn't it? 




 Suzy is the greatest goose in the gaggle of Grumps 




 She wasn't referring to the fanbase, just the subreddit.

And was she wrong?

Literally everything you said is inaccurate, except for saying that Game Grumps makes money from their videos. (not your fault though, people perpetuate these myths so much that it becomes one of those things accepted as "common knowledge" even though it's completely wrong) 




 You don't need to "see evidence" to understand how a multichannel network functions.

Maker has access to the channel, that doesn't mean they control it.

Multi-Channel Networks (MCNs) are entities that affiliate with multiple YouTube channels, often to offer assistance in areas such as product, programming, funding, cross-promotion, partner management, digital rights management, monetization/sales, and/or audience development"

They pulled the videos because those videos were infringing on copyright. If all of those videos got flagged at the same time, and Youtube accepted the claims, the channel would be shut down immediately, considering that it only takes three strikes.

Maker was not acting maliciously, they were protecting the Grumps, even if the Grumps think they should be able to sing random songs.

They still can sing songs as long as they change the words and make fun of them, therefore classifying it as a parody. They'll soon realize that and I'm sure they'll go back an re-edit those videos to include parody versions of the songs they are singing (or at least censor those parts) 




 Cover songs are NOT covered under fair use!

People HAVE been flagged for this before, it's just extremely rare because most record companies don't care about people just singing a song. (but why risk your business over this? Just don't sing songs)

But yes, it is copyright infringement, regardless if it's considered a cover.

http://www.songrights.com/infringe.htm 




 That doesn't make them in control of the Grumps. It just means they have access to the channel in case of situations like these 




 I just shat after an hour or two of constipation.

It was like the weight of the world being lifted off my shoulders

Or, more realistically, out of my anus 




 Best thing I've ever read on Conspiracy Grumps 




 That's the most common myth people believe, but the truth is, it's infringement regardless of the amount of time.


If you are doing a video that falls under fair use (a review, a critique) then using 30 seconds is protected. Game Grumps is not a review show.

And they would also have to PROVE fair use, it's not automatically assumed.  




 Ah, the classic "I say something therefore it is true and I will reiterate it as often as possible" technique. 
Like I've never seen that technique from a marijuana user.

Marijuana is not healthy. There is no reason it should be illegal, but it is definitely not healthy. It's not terrible, but neither is it healthy.

And science disagrees with what you say science says about weed:

 It wouldn't be via Maker, it would be between themselves (Maker does not control any of the channels that sign with it. Multichannel Networks function like talent agents.) And an NDA wouldn't prevent them from talking about Jon, just behind the scenes details.

Arin explained why they didn't talk about Jon, WAAAAAY long ago and there is nothing sinister behind it:

http://www.reddit.com/r/gamegrumps/comments/1j21po/thank_you_all/cbae3uj 

Once all that emotion died down it was okay to talk about him again 




 lol, no. It's not Maker's rules, Maker doesn't own Grumps. It's a simple business decision, don't do anything that might get your video flagged for copyright infringement.

And no, it isn't covered under fair use. You cannot sing or play a song that you do not have the rights to in a video that you are monetizing. Plain and simple.

Arin is smart enough to know that it's best not to risk getting his channel taken down over something as dumb as singing some song. 

Though, as long as they parody the song, changing the words/making fun of it, then they have free reign.


EDIT: Lol, why the hell was this downvoted? Because people "disagree?" I'm sorry folks, but that's the sad truth. That doesn't mean you downvote something. Do a small amount of research on copyright infringement, fair use, and the way MCN's function. 




 lol, okay 




 lol "unfortunately"
