 My issue with Tasker is that I just simply do not have a normal routine.  I don't always want X to happen when I'm near Y or similar.  Right now though, paired with AutoVoice, it's giving me a bunch of amazing voice commands, so there's that. 




 Stormreaver and Korgath are the two servers I played on.  My mage was in Death and Taxes   TFO on Korgath during TBC.  Both of those servers were focused on high progression, and were very high population pvp servers.  I semi-quit during Cataclysm, so it's been a while since I've played seriously at any level.  Dungeon/Raid finder basically removed most of my friends because they logged in, queued for DF/RF, and logged out for the week.  All of my friends became disinterested in hard modes or even normal modes for that fucking matter, because they had already seen all the content...that's all they wanted to do after all.  So I was left on a progression server, with nobody wanting to do progression because they already saw all the content!

That's my huge gripe with ezmode raids; a large portion of the population just wants to see what's new and then not go any further.  At least when that content was locked out, they were eager to earn the rights and the ability to go into that content to prove their worth.

Did it eat a lot of time?  Yeah.  But it made those accomplishments all that more worth while. 




 They did take 310% away. [[Proof]](http://www.wowhead.com/achievement=2144/what-a-long-strange-trip-its-been#comments:id=1695700) Turns out that in 4.0.1 they just simply gave it to _everyone_ and anyone with a 310% mount immediately got the master riding skill to accompany it without having to purchase it.

Also, people _did_ give a flying rats ass, I know because I'm not so short-sighted to forget the absolute awe that I felt when someone rode up to me on an epic mount for the first time.  Most of the population of WoW did indeed care; the whispers that I got _constantly_ over my gear are a testament to that.  Just because you never reached that level (because of lack of skill, or lack of social skills, whatever) doesn't mean that there wasn't a bit of extravagance to having that gear. 




 It's a good thing that I actually did my research on it before commenting then, so I don't look like an idiot.  Certain species of spiders can go a year between meals. 




 I've had _WAY_ too many instances of running through the woods as a child, and having an orb weaver plaster itself and its web right on the center of my fucking face to hate those suckers too.

Though, the little spiky ones are cool, they're apparently orb weavers too.   




 Remember ladies and gentleman: The only difference between fucking around and science, is writing it down! 




 Oh fuck here we go.  All aboard the "we hate jennifer lawrence because she's too popular and she's really just fake-quirky"...etc etc etc etc... 




 Honestly, to all the spider apologists out there: Some species of spider can live for a year or more without a meal.  So, even at frequent feeding intervals, spiders probably only eat a bug a week.  Fuck that.  Not enough to earn freaking me out all the time.  Spiders will fucking die around me.  (Except the little jumping spiders, those guys are awesome!)

Lizards, on the other hand.  Now _they_ can eat a ton of bugs!  I love me some lizards. 




 Nobody cares about foozball either. 




 I skipped Cata and MoP because of this; with the button trimming and some of the other changes they're making, I might just start playing again.  Nothing will beat the nostalgia, because I'm simply no longer impressed by the expansive worlds, but maybe I'll be happy dumping my time into it again. :D 




 I do have something against people liking the game in a different way than me, when the rewards look exactly like the rewards from the more difficult version that I'm doing.

When people get the same art on their gear, as I do on mine, but in a slightly different color then yeah; I feel cheated.

If you walked around with Naxx gear on a server back in Vanilla, you were hot shit.  You got to show that off.  Now?  Nope.  Everyone's got the same fucking gear, with a different color (at most)

I'm actually really glad that they took 310% riding away from players who did the holiday achievements for a year.  I got mine by doing hard mode Ulduar, and put a lot of work into it - I got to hang onto that permanently, and that feels good. 




 Yeah!  Some of us _LIKE_ to listen to 10 commercials in between sets of songs! 




 I said I told them I'd break their legs; I'd never actually do it.  You can't say "I'm gonna break your legs" and not act like you mean it.  Then it doesn't get the point across.

Stupid fuck. 




 That's not how this works.  That's not how _any_ of this works! 




 I've been harassed by these people for years and years until I told them I will break their legs with a baseball bat next time they step foot on my property.  I tried being nice.  Sometimes nice doesn't work. 




 That's also a garbage hot end being used, which likely resulted in much more back pressure than modern hot ends have.  It likely caused the idler to be overtentioned just to get the thing to extrude.

 Even 90 isn't a problem sometimes: http://www.thingiverse.com/make:63848 -- No support material on that print.  It's not mine, but I didn't take a picture of the one I made.

PLA, with a strong fan, can occasionally do even 90 degree, flat out into the middle of nowhere.  It can't be _too_ far away, but you'd be surprised at what the plastic can accomplish occasionally. 




 The thing is, games do it all the time.  In fact that's exactly how they manage to get all of their controls to look good on all screens. 




 I've often wondered; why don't more devs use vector images, and just use the devices resolution to "compile" the raster images on first bootup?

 Thank you!  Someone who actually understands how heat sinks work!  You can't just put thin fins 20 inches high and get any radiative effects.

You've got to have a thick base, with enough metal to literally sink the heat into (hence the whole heatsink name!).  Then you've got to have fins that aren't so thin that they won't conduct heat away from the block.

And on passive heat sinks, you rely on convection of the air being heated up in order to generate the breeze that a fan would normally.

Additionally, for a peltier - you're going to want something with heat pipes, that rely on the phase change of a liquid inside to increase efficiency. 




 Maybe if you're using some weird, chinese, not-really-PLA "PLA".  But PLA normally does not curl. 




 get yo' booty, on the floor 




 I thought a PN junction was basically just a diode.  They can have current through them reversed in order to reverse the side that cools, and it doesn't harm them in any way. 




 What? PLA doesn't curl...  




 Namecoin 




 You're letting heat creep up the heatsink too far.  Hook the fan up that comes with it, and never run without it.

  someone is trying to protect this minor child

But I don't see that at all.  "this minor child".  "missing youth".  "this child".  None of this sounds like anyone who cares about her at all.  There's a _lot_ of disconnection in the wording of this entire post.

Something about this post just rubs me the wrong way.  I'm not trying to troll...but something fishy is going on here.  None of the wording, or information posted suggests someone who is truly worried that this child is in danger.  The whole fucking thing is sketchy.

 




 Well, honestly I've been saying "kids being kids" and also "this isn't _only_ the kids fault ya know"...

Bad parenting plays far more part in this than the kids being kids portion. 




 I **do** stand idly by and watch bad stuff happen to them.  You _HAVE TO_.  Maybe not so much in this instance, but this attitude is exactly what drives kids to such extremes; parents who are overprotective as the child is growing up. 




 I have two daughters of my own.  But I'm not so old that I forget what it's like to be that age.  Many people I know did cocaine, smoked pot, did a little acid for a bit, and we're perfectly fine members of society who didn't need a "treatment facility".  Fuck, I'd run away too if anyone had ever tried to force me into that shit. 




 And psychologically speaking, this is the reply of someone who knows it's the truth.  Act mad in order to deflect the subject. 




 She obviously isn't in danger as claimed.  She obviously doesn't want to go to a "treatment facility".  Sounds like a kid who's been sheltered from everything or not parented properly and is just lashing out.  Not to mention that it's a throwaway account, there's no information about her actually doing _anything wrong_... 




 I work at DeltaMaker.  We're fine.  Looking at shipping around 40 printers rather soon which I think should finish us up with domestic shipments, and have enough stock to continue building and selling.  We have enough margin to keep us afloat and I've made enough changes to the original development that it's a worthwhile machine now. 

Our biggest hurdle is that our machines simply take a long time to build.  We're working on speeding up the process.

 Flash controllers hide that bit.  They write randomly across the chips, but that's not reflected in what the OS knows.  The flash controller shows the OS that everything is within X and Y.  But on the other side of that controller, it could be anywhere on the chip due to wear leveling, etc.

EXT2/3/4 already leave a little bit of extra space between files as is.  I know there are some "holes" in there.

There's no reason for me to actually worry about that bit...I was being pedantic and merely included it so people reading knew I wasn't completely clueless. 




 Likely you're slipping on a travel move.  Ever so slightly slipping.  It's because the printrbot simple uses those spectra lines on top of hosing; probably one of the first upgrades you should make imho.

Slow down your travel moves, and see if that helps the problem.  Then look into a solid solution by switching to toothed belts. 




 Thanks for the help; I figured out how to do it via DD, by limiting how much data it copied beyond the end of my partitions. 




 Turns out, shrinking the partitions, and calculating the size of the mbr+partition table+partition1+partition2, and using bs=1M and count=[some multiple of 1 meg] was the solution.  I was able to copy 7.5gb, all the way up to the end of partition2 and that worked. :) 




 and then I'm only copying 1 partition out of 3.  And you'll say "well copy all 3 partitions"...then we're back _exactly_ at the problem I described in my very first post.

Like I didn't already try exactly what you're suggesting... _

Did you even read it? 




 That's exactly the opposite of what he did.  You should really go back and re-read the instructions he posted.

How about reading steps 3 and 4?

3.Partition the destination disk into partitions with sizes greater than copied data and should be of same format and same flags using gparted. Please google how to partition a disk.

4.Now mount the freshly formatted and partitioned disk. Mostly you need to just connect the disk to system and you can find the mounted partitions in /media folder. 




 I'm running Linux.  The other people helping me are simply writing the images.  They can use Win32DiskImager - but it bitches and fails to even start writing the card if the image is too big.  So yes, this was a Linux solution, for a windows problem...because I don't use Windows. 




 You're quite wrong.  DD was the solution; I merely needed to calculate the partition boundaries and take that into account. 




 In my case, I simply resized the partition down and left a bunch of unpartitioned space at the end.  May not be the best solution for you though. :/ 




 Thank you; this looks like it's my solution.  Push all the partitions to the "front" (they already are) and then specifically set my block size to 1M, and count to 7500; which should give me a 7.5gb image.  It copies a little bit of the "blank" data but it's enough to give me the room I need.

Thanks! 




 _I'M_ on Linux.  They're using their personal machines with Win32DiskImager to write the image files to SD cards to help parallelize it.  I can't be installing cygwin to their machines for them to run this.  It's not happening, I cannot use it as a solution. 




 It is shrunk; dd still copies the entire device. 




 On windows? 




 I have 3 other users helping me flash cards (2 on windows).  They can flash an image to an SD card, but they wouldn't be able to follow those instructions for shit, and it would end up just being me doing 100+ cards.  I can't use that as a solution. 




 So I have the task of copying a master image of an 8gb SD card, over to hundreds of other SD cards.  The problem is that the cards vary in size (a couple mb smaller or larger than a full 8gb), and some of the windows utilities just simply refuse to write the image if the card is smaller.

I'm trying to grab an image of the card, minus anything at the "end", so that the image I'm writing is like 7.5gb, instead of the full 8gb.  I can't seem to find a straightforward way of doing this.

I've tried copying the first 512 (mbr/partition table) and then concatenating it with the partition images, but I'm guessing that doesn't work because partitions need to be aligned to the blocksize.  (After writing the image, it won't boot)

I've already got the SD card image so that the partitions are resized and there is ~750mb free at the "end" of the drive (I say this because I'm aware how flash controllers don't write data sequentially). 




 Is it bad, that even though they'd give me one for free, I still don't want the fucking thing? 




 As stated elsewhere in the thread, the blazer does the "dreaded X", which is a sign that it's too small. 




 @Portis403; the 3D Print Blood vessels was posted by "3DPrint.com" which the community has recently been found to be simply making shit up.  There was no research done.  No references in their article.  They are run by a set of brothers who have been knowingly spamming across the entire internet attempting to get their 3D printing "property" (domains 3Dprint.com and 3dprintboard.com) to be worth more money.

Unfortunately a bunch of places picked up the story without verifying it, but be aware that it's likely completely fabricated.

 If you're using slic3r or cura as well; try out the support material.  It sounds like the print is oriented in such a way that it's trying to build a piece out in mid air, and it needs something to rest on that can be peeled away later.  KISSlicer isn't beginner friendly as far as UIs go; so use what you're familiar with first and determine if that's what you need for this print to succeed. 




 Skull above the teeth.  See that plateauing?  That's the result of your motor jumping to a full step position on the motor due to microstepping being unable to function for whatever reason.  Usually this is due to a mis-selected motor that's "rated" for 12v, and being powered by 12v.  For microstepping to work, we actually use motors rated for 2v or so, and run them at 12v, but chop the signal up so that there's not too much power going through the motor.  That allows us to get intermediate steps between the full 200 steps.  Gives us smoother lines, better resolution, etc. 




 Well; depends.  What stepper motors are you using?  Ideally they should be "rated" for 2-4v   1.5-4ohm.  If the motors you're using say they are "rated" for 12v, and are 15-30ohm then simply swapping out for the correct motors will fix it.  Also, which machine is this on?  Kossel or Prusa i3?  If it's on the Delta; increasing your delta_segments_per_sec will help increase the quality of the print.  (Also able to create these types of patterning)

 Any recommendations?  I couldn't find a subreddit that I felt comfortable asking in short of this one.

I recently got hooked on these: http://www.amazon.com/Pringles-Honey-Butter-Stix-Ounce/dp/B00BFN0EJI - and they have just a very concentrated butter/honey flavor with bits of salt.  I can't really find very many buttery flavors out there that sound like what I'm looking for.

 I'm working on a project building a 3D printer with a 405nm 20mw laser.  However, the diode puts out an elongated beam.  When focused, it's difficult to tell, but will result in the print in UV reactive resin being less accurate in one axis.  Are there any common cylindrical lenses which I can use in the housing to help shape the elongated beam into a sphere or would I be better off using a beam-mask before the focusing lens? 









 I'm kinda iffy over the eVic after seeing so many harsh reviews on it.  Loose ring, shutting off when battery is 45%, etc.  Are there any other options that have VW+VV, Ohm checker, built-in charger (don't want to have to carry around a wall charger everywhere I go, but I've got USB ports everywhere)?

Also, are there any kind of open source electronics for maybe building a box mod?  If there's something like the eVic's internals, I'd love to fiddle with that.  Also, are there any reputable places which sell "eGo heads" or something similar for tinkering?  I'm very familiar with Atmel microcontrollers, board design, etc and I'm interested in creating something that has some experimental ideas or has the ability to be reprogrammed for other people to attempt their ideas.  (Coil power curves, and the like)

 I've been a Florida resident my whole life, but never got to go to Disney until just a couple months ago.  My 5 year old daughter _loves_ Magic Kingdom and we're finishing up our 3-day passes this Thursday.

I plan on possibly going again this year, but what is the best time to do that?  When is the park the most empty?  And is Epcot good for a kid who absolutely can't get enough of the rides?  She loved the little roller coaster @ Magic Kingdom so much that she cried when she had to get off...

Any other places that could be recommended that are focused on rides? 




 A while back, maybe 2 years ago, I was working on a JRPG, but got caught up with state machines.  My hangup was getting everything modular and able to be extended properly, etc.  Yes yes, I know I know...typical move...jump into programming wanting to make a big project like an RPG; I fell right into that trap.

Recently, a post that included a link to here: http://hub.tutsplus.com/categories/game-design/articles/gamedev-6676-how-to-build-a-jrpg-a-primer-for-game-developers got me re-interested.

I was also interested in Python on Android at the time, and had basically gotten this far: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKrlPS8J0fA

I had a character moving around on the screen, and was working on tilemapping.  The other thing I was working on, was a state machine, so I could break apart the game into different files (instead of one single file like I had been doing for so long).

I got as far as this: http://pastebin.com/mC5ugQcs

A year later, I'm back looking at the code, and also looking at the "How to Build a JRPG", and am noticing that it looks like I'm doing something similar to what his very first example of a state machine is doing.  A big problem also is that I used to understand the code before, but now I'm kind of flabbergasted by it.  I'm not sure how it works anymore (it was still a _little_ bit magic when I had help making it).  I understand what super() is doing, it's calling the inherited \_\_init\_\_ even though I've overridden it.  The problem I'm having is with the magic of StateManager.

I'd like to turn it into something like his second example, but the pseudo-code he's using is also throwing me for a loop, I'm not used to using map or what it does.  I like the idea of just having states that I can append to a list, and then pop off but is there a way to modify that list inside the scope of a class?  I fear using a global list is not the way to accomplish this.  I've also been kinda iffy about states returning other states...at some point wouldn't I hit a recursion limit?  I'd like to be able to pop the state off of the stack so it doesn't have to know what other point it came from or where it's going to.

Also, I would like to break this all into separate files, so a new state can be added by making a new file in a directory.  All I need to do for this is add an init.py in a subdirectory, and then import [subdirectory] right? 









 The file I need 2 of is here: https://raw.github.com/josefprusa/Prusa3/master/single_plate/src/frame/6mm/Prusa3ALU-FREZOVANY-v4.dxf (right-click, save as)

What's the cheapest I could get something like this?  Any shops have scrap and some extra time?  It could probably be CNC routed too, but there are a bunch of small holes, and would probably require extra setup.

I believe the plate is like 20" (500mm-ish) square and needs 6mm thick aluminum (or something close to that thickness anyhow) 



















 FamiLAB, a hackerspace in the greater orlando area, is toying around with offering a semi-annual 3D printer workshop, in which you work with a bunch of other people, get assistance assembling a kit-based printer, as well as education on how they work, how to tune them, how to use the software, etc.

If there is an interest in such a thing, would $400 be something you'd be willing to drop a couple weeks in advance of the class/workshop?  The cheapest kits out there right now are $399 (currently the printrbot jr: http://printrbot.com/shop/printrbot-jr/) so you'd be getting quite a value with the help you'd receive.  The kit comes with a little bit of plastic to print with, and you'd leave with a fully working machine and a good understanding of it.

*edit:* Right now I'm unsure of how much time this would all take.  Would 4 hours for 2 days (total of 8 hours) be too long? 




 Looking for a suitable H-bridge (or Dual H-Bridge) driver for a remote control car project, but I don't want to spend $60 on an ESC because i'll be pairing it with a microcontroller anyways, and all of the ESCs I've run across already have an AVR built onto them.  What are my options for a  15A, 7-18v H-bridge?  I see millions of L298s floating around, and I even _have_ one of these packages, and it's not suitable for my purposes (overheats and goes into thermal shutdown).

Would an ESC still be a better option?  What chips would you recommend?
