 Thanks, so is [this](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001O4EPHA/ref=noref?ie=UTF8 psc=1 s=electronics) the cable that I need?

I'll still look at some guides before I pull the trigger, don't want to mess this up. 




 Trying to build a gaming PC, basically used Logical Increments to come up with:

The only things I can remember that I didn't take from LI were the RAM and optical drive, are those 2 alright? Any other comments on the parts are also highly appreciated.

The thing I'm most concerned about in the build are the cables, I get pretty lost when people start hooking everything up in the videos I watch. Is it easy to find clear instructions in the manuals? And most importantly, do I need to buy any cables, or are they all included with the parts? (the optical drive is what got me worried)

Thanks for any help. 




 WHO THE FUCK IS TOM BOMBADIL?

"He fucking is," said Goldberry. 




 And the lighthouse is [Farol da Barra](http://i.imgur.com/lLsqK.jpg) :) 




 That's the [National Congress of Brazil](http://i.imgur.com/AfX7k.jpg). 




 Anyone familiar with the guy playing Beorn? One of my favorite characters, and I always pictured him as a huge lumberjack sort of guy, not sure that actor looks the part. 




 I've only seen the the 100 in black, [like so.](http://www.absolut.com/content/products/images/absolut100/bottleImage.jpg) I have one of those around somewhere. 




 I can't find anything with that name, is it [this one](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/16925-PLUGIN-PART-0-17-Aviation-Lights-v1-0?highlight=lights)?

 




 [Here's my Saturn V-inspired build](http://imgur.com/a/VFFax). As you can see, it was pretty tried and true on the Mun, always had enough fuel to make it back. Got me to Eve just by adding a bunch of boosters and one or two small modifications (though that lander was a one-way trip). 




 Patcher wasn't working for me, either.

But 0.17 finally appeared on the download page and it's been going pretty fast so far, seems like the best way to get it. 




 I personally like using [Heavens Above](http://www.heavens-above.com/).

If you want to see other satellites, I live in a pretty bright suburb and I don't bother with anything above a magnitude 1 (the lower the better).
