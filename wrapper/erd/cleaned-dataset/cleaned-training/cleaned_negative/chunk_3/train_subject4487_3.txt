CC has some protection as you can do a charge back.

 I'm an old Apple guy going back to Apple IIe and I switched to Windows several years ago.  I have no plans of going back. My last Mac was the big aluminum iMac, I've had TONS of Apple computers over the years, I still have my SE which still works and my original candy transparent colored iMac which still works. The latter is worth nothing resale wise, the former I keep because I'd like to eventually do something with it.

Mainly, I switched because I didn't like that I could only buy what Apple wanted to sell me. At a premium price. With a PC, I can build/expand anything I want for less $. There's tremendous freedom in that. Also, I've never had a problem with Windoze. My first personal PC had Windows XP on it and I still think it was a decent OS. Still have that PC as well.  Used Vista for 2 years at a past job, didn't understand all the hate it got.

I don't miss anything. Really...I think you should give it a try. 




 This is the most interesting thing they came up with for Nebraska?  Shit, the state is shaped like a cannon, they could blow up Wyoming for fuck's sake.

 Just received an email from Monarch.  They have cool hand poured bars if you're into that.  I'm not a fan of their tiered shipping prices, but here's some savings if you're looking at them.

* $5.00 off your purchase of $250.00 or more with coupon code: Feb5

* $25.00 off your purchase of $1,350.00 or more with coupon code: Feb25

Enter code during checkout for instant savings. Only one coupon may be used per order. If multiple orders are combined into a single shipment with a single shipping charge, only one coupon may be applied towards that transaction.

HURRY! Coupon codes expire at 5pm (Pacific time) on Wednesday, February 11th, 2015. 









 Interesting listening.  So they have a company (Durandal, Inc., providing products) backing this with full-time folks (biz people, developers, ux folks). "Not just some dude coding this at night."

So what's the revenue model here, eventual pay framework/components? 




 Why are you using document.write() instead of creating/appending DOM elements/nodes? What are you actually trying to do?

  I want to stress how bad the performance is. 

I don't know if it'll make a difference for you (or if you're not doing this), but have you looked into one-time data binding? If you have any values that are set during the first digest and never need to be updated on the view, those would be good candidates for refactoring. 




 I dated Mt. Hood a couple years ago during the winter.  Didn't have to put in a lot of miles before she put out, so can't complain too much.

*Coin forums are loaded with theories from seasoned experts in the field. Many trace the cause of these tiny white spots to a wash the U.S. Mint is using. Specifically, the culprit appears to be detergent residue that isnt rinsed off before the .999-silver planchets hit the annealing furnace. As the cleaned silver planchets get heated to scorching temperatures exceeding 1,000F, any leftover detergent solution is inadvertently baked into the surface of the coin. The woeful chemical reaction between the baked-in detergent and the coins metal may take weeks, months or even years to surface.*

*As PCGS points out, milk spots indeed trace their origin back to manufacturing issues at the U.S. Mint. As much was affirmed by U.S. Mint Quality Division Chief Stacy Kelley-Scherer, who, in 2012, remarked that the white spots on American Silver Eagles are attributed to minting procedures. Unfortunately, Kelly-Scherer went on the record as saying that the U.S. Mint has not been able to find a panacea for preventing milk spots.*

*The Royal Canadian Mint (RCM) owes the milk spots on its coins to the planchet cleaning and preparation process...In short, RCM officials say they cant do anything about the spots*

 I noticed this new payment feature on JM Bullion's checkout page recently and just received this email from them:

 *Silver output from mines will total 867.7 million ounces this year, according to the Silver Institute. About 30 percent comes from primary operations, while the rest is produced as a by-product from mining metals such as copper, lead and zinc. About 50 percent of primary silver mines dont make a profit at $19 an ounce, $2.50 more than the current price, according to Brown.*

 Picked up SOD for $5 (I think it was) over the Steam holiday sales blitz.  Pretty cool, but I have no idea what I'm doing.

I've basically made my way to the first home base (from the Ranger Station to the Church) and I've been free-roaming/looting the nearby buildings trying to figure things out. I'm not venturing out that far, I've hardly explored the map at all at this point.

I've built a couple things at the home base (an outdoor sleeping tent area and some sort of workbench) but I'm not sure how, or if I can even use them.  I think I'm supposed to reenforce the walls or something as well but not really sure.

I seem to be getting called out on a lot of stupid morale/fear missions where you have to talk to someone in your home base and then you just go outside and kill some zeds.  That was OK the first couple times but it sure seems to be a repetitive theme for me.

I've gone on a small number of missions.

I've lost 2 characters.

What are some pro tips/advice you wish you knew when you were just starting out? 

















































 Anyone know where I can get some heavy duty boot laces locally/west side?

 Platinum demand will outpace supply by 1.13 million ounces this year and palladiums deficit will be 1.62 million ounces, according to a presentation of London-based Johnson Mattheys platinum-group metals report.

 Hello,

Wondering what's out there in terms of a portable indoor heat source if the power goes out in the winter? Something that could heat a bedroom would be sufficient.

For those who can't light a fire, how are you preparing for winter storms taking out your power for a day or two or more.

A portable generator isn't really an option for me, either.

What is out there in the marketplace? 














 I was pricing an item out last night and was surprised to find Gainesville Coins credit card price not too bad.  Shipping, however, was quoted at $26 via USPS which I find quite rapey, to be honest. UPS Ground was quoted at $30 and I would have to pay for the privilege to go pick it up on my own time/dime (over 40 miles trip), so that's a no go for me.

Anyone know how they ship via USPS?  Is my order going to be put into a flat rate box? Typical 3 day delivery cross country?  I don't think I've ever paid more than $14.95 for shipping from any other vendor and that was for larger orders.

I've never purchased from them before as they don't take personal checks and I'm all about getting cash discounts.
