 I don't think so. I don't remember any scene like that from the movie. 




 Are those greenscreens outside the windows ?? 




 And Hardline. 














 Yeah, it will be a huge difference in audio(compared to 2CH in torrents) as you have a surround system as the blu-rays have uncompressed sound. You may notice a mild difference in video. The color would  appear more vibrant and grainyness and blockiness would be bare minimum. 




 Brazil  




 Each camera captures footage of the fight scene from different angles. This is helps in completing the fight in a single take.  




 As someone who was just like you, I have recently started collecting blu-rays. I think it is really worth if you respect the art form of movies. Here is my piece of advice :

* Learn about the region coding of blu-ray discs and players. Buying a region-free blu-ray player is a great advantage if you want to import from other countries.

* Work you way through bargains and box-sets first. This really helps to start a collection.

* You might wanna wait and see if 4k blu-rays, which will be released by the end of the year are reasonably priced or not. If they are, then you could buy a 4k blu-ray player (If you have a 4k TV or if you are planning to buy so in the near future).





 









 Clouds, you scary.

 Oscars make history. What a Joke. Look at Terminator 1. 




 The Night Of The Hunter (1955) 









 But, but .... PG-13. 









 Watch Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse (1991)  




 1 Movie. 36 Years. Still Remembered. 




 For $7, it is a steal. 









 The music and voices are just perfect. 




 That's not how any of this works. 




 Wow... this looks refreshing. 









 I think this may be worse than the original.

 He is even making 'The Irishman' with De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci
 














 Solaris and Stalker. 




 We are making the swing move like a pendulum with enough force. The ropes are like the string of a pendulum and the bench and your body is the weight.

We push the rope so that we get enough momentum. 




 This thing should be named " Death Swing " 




 Hope you ain't dead OP. 














 First world problems at it's finest.
 




 I don't think Neil Blomkamp plays a robot in any film.

 He is actually Jack Pierce, who is a legendary make up artist for Universal Studios. 









 I think what you are referring to, is the Band Of Brothers [Carentan](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1247463/) episode. 




 It was a mock up. The Tiger Tank used in the movie was a converted Russian T34/85.

But, Fury (2014) featured an authentic WW2 Tiger Tank 




 Nope. It's a real solid movie.

Edit : I Agree that the ending was total shit. 




 Although i haven't watched Stalingrad yet, Das Boot (Director's Cut) is a masterpiece.
 




 Ah.. the year " The Thin Red Line " went home empty handed. 



















 Gotta Agree. Narc had a way better script. 




 When a Las Vegas bodyguard with lethal skills and a gambling problem gets in trouble with the mob, he has one last play...and it's all or nothing.

Sound Pretty meh.  




 Matchstick Men is a great Nic Cage pic too. Directed by Ridley Scott.

 I'm Sure Jodorowsky's Dune falls under this category.

My Best Fiend (1999) by Wener Herzog is a great documentary too.
(Its more like a collection of anectodes) 




 Night of the Living Dead was a real landmark in film history. 












































 For anyone interested to watch the whole documentary, the video is from [here](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102015/?ref_=nv_sr_1) 









 Aguirre is a fucking great movie.

 Yes, i know the technique is achieved by another actor who mimics the other hence creating the look of a fake mirror (Eg: The Terminator).

Edit : Should have edited the titled to " the camera work is impeccable in the movie." 









 No doubt.
