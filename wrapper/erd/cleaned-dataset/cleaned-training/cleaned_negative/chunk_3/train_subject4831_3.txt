 You should try quilling! Its super easy and really fun, [example](http://www.epherielldesigns.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/yulia-brodskaya-paper-construction-heart.jpg)

All you need are small strips of paper and a quilling tool, or curl them by hand by simply rolling them (i did this for ages until i discovered the quilling tool). Then using a fast drying glue use small blobs to stick them down. Its simple, easy but very effective and pretty.
