 The main problem is the graphics card in your iMac/MacBook. There are only options for mobile graphic cards, which are in no way equivalent to desktop graphic cards.

You get an iMac with a GTX750m which is WAY weaker than a Desktop GTX750. You just cant build a MacBook that can compete with a desktop-pc when the pc's card is as large as the whole macbook.

People saying "yeah gaming is nice on my macbook" - thats because you dont play AAA games and are not a "gamer"

GeForce GTX 750M 1,526 points 

GeForce GTX 750 3,260 points 

GTX750 is about $100, for a macbook with a GTX750M you have to pay $1500+ 




 for me its always interesting to see those commercials, because in germany its forbidden to show products of competitors or talk about them in advertisements. (leads to pretty boring ads)
