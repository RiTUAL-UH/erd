 Oh I'm definitely going to watch this movie. Thank you so much for sharing! 




 I spent a lot of time thinking about how to lable/describe myself, or where I fit/could fit. I'm 21 now (so still pretty young) and I always hated it when someone asked me "Who are you?",  because I didn't have an answer! Do you already need to know, when you're still so young? Is it really that necessary to now know where your place in this society is? Doesn't that come with time, patience and experience? And does someone really want you to describe yourself in one sentence, since you're so much more than just one quick answer?


Once I started thinking about this society with its values and morals, about people describing themselves with their job, about how everyone expects you to fit into this society, because otherwise you would not be a part of it, **that's** where I stopped trying to fit into something:

We are **not** just a sentence or just a part of a category, or simply our job. We have a story, we are what we feel, we are our actions, we are what we like and what we dislike and **so**  ridiculously much more! 
I don't strongly refuse to fit, it's (to me) simply not possible, since we humans can be so complex and so much more versatile. As you said it, we would limit ourselves down to a category and that would be a waste of a humans potential. 


To me, you are definitely not crazy and first and foremost definitely not alone! I'm sending you lots of love, patience and hugs and I really hope you'll find yourself some day! 3


PS: I am still figuring out who I am and I am pretty sure, that this is going to be a long process. I'm just sharing some of my thoughts in the hope that someone could find them somehow useful, in which way ever. 




 I think same can go for arrogance. Now I'm not a psychologist, but I'm still pretty sure that behind that arrogant mask, an insecurity is hidden. 




 this is a cool idea! Would be interesting to see how the communication between only introverts goes.
