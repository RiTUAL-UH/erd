  Like most people who vote for Republicans, you aren't making even a little bit of an effort to engage with reality. 

Condescending tone noted.

 Public financing of higher education might not address plummeting admissions standards, but piling huge debt loads on the shoulders of young people is also not a solution to that problem.

Did I say that adding more debt is a solution? The debt is a symptom. That's what I said. Did you read?

Whatever else you might be referring to as a "root cause" is probably something that isn't even real

So you are making assumptions that I must be a hallucinating Republican. I just make s*** up. That must be it. 

Or maybe you can ask me like a normal person what I mean, instead of being so condescending and pretentious.

 As far as tax reform goes, it sounds like you've got some sort of trickle-down sickness. Wealth definitely does not flow from billionaires to normal folks, no matter how much more favoritism our economy shows to the billionaires. 

Your second [straw-man](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/strawman) argument. Did I say anything of the such? Basically you have categorized me as a Republican, therefor you slap random talking points on me, and then argue against those.

 Fortunately, no one (except apparently /u/train_subject5136 ) believes taxation trickles down.

Really not sure how you got that from what I said. Same straw-man argument. Instead of making stupid assumptions, ask me what I mean 

 You really should be upset at whoever put such a foolishly toxic idea into your mind.

I guess I should be mad at Santa or the tooth fairy.  




 You mean like Germany? Who has a higher barrier for entry to get into college, and doesn't let everyone go to college? 

And I really hate the comparisons to European countries that are 1/20th our size. Netherlands has a **significantly** less diverse population. I'm not sure what this fascination is about taking these small European countries that are *nothing* like the USA, and trying to apply their policies here. Also don't forget their taxes are significantly higher, *for everyone, not just the rich*.

People also like to site Denmark, but they too will have issues with their job market in the future. See [here](http://www.businessinsider.com/free-universities-and-no-student-loan-debt-is-hurting-denmarks-economy-2014-6). Not the best or most detailed source, but this is sort of what happens when you throw around free tuition for all.

I'm all for lowering the cost of education - but just subsidizing it is absolutely the wrong approach. We need to be selective of how many people get free tuition, as well as what majors they can take. We can't subsidize 1,000,000 people getting sociology majors. We would be setting them all up to fail.

The issue is with universities raising their tuition, and the government continually subsidizing this inflated tuition. There are many other issues as well, such as the cultural mindset of the necessity of going to college and drowning ourselves in debt for worthless degrees. 

Making tuition free across the board solves absolutely nothing. Not to mention institutions will just raise their tuition accordingly. I would like to see less students going to college, and more students getting work that does not require an official 4 year degree. See Mike Rowe.  




 I find Liberal arguments tend to be watered-down, over simplified, and shortened. I see liberal memes all the time that illicit the kind of, "F*** those damn Republicans/banks/rich ppl" etc, with out going into any detail of why something is the way it is.

Liberals are often not interested in deep discussion, but pointing at a few numbers and screaming "they hate the poor, rich people are evil" etc. It's really repetitive, and appeals to the lowest common denominator.

I'm not saying Republicans/conservatives don't this - but to say *"it deals with nuance and how far to go in one direction or the other. It doesn't lend itself to bumper stickers or Facebook memes very well. "* I think is very untrue.

The other problem is that Liberals are intent on fixing symptoms instead of the root cause of a problem. Bernie Sanders for example wants to make tuition free - this is a perfect example of patching up a symptom, instead of taking the (more difficult to do, and more difficult to sell to the masses) approach of fixing the root cause.

/u/tommyrp says below:

 The problem with Liberalism is that it dosen't actually solve any of the problems. The solution is always the same, lets take money from one group of people and hand it to another group of people. Healthcare too expensive? Let someone else pay for it, can't afford food? Let someone else pay for it. Education too expensive, lets subsidies student loans with someone elses money. I've never see any Liberal actually talk about actually fixing the real issues of cost in healthcare, education or poverty.

Liberalism nowaday just seems to mostly be a finger pointing game, riling up emotions of people who aren't doing well, using their pain and directing at political opponents. Liberals by and large appear to be *petty*, and operate on the theme "It's conservatives/rich folk/wall street's fault". It might be partially true, but when that is your only message, it's hard to take you seriously. 


 




 /r/politics is a liberal fest. I assume you're joking, or stupid. 




 I sort of agree with you, except for the socialist-like stances he takes on some things would be detrimental to the country as a whole. One example, the "free tuition for all" is a short-sighted 'solution' that covers up a symptom instead of fixing the root cause. Also his ideas about tax reform are downright insane, and would increase the tax burden of **all** Americans. Those kind of stances would still force me to vote for a Republican over Bernie.

 I think people also forget that it has always been much harder to beat Nadal in Grand Slams (where you need to win 3 sets, not 2). Nadal has always done historically much better at grand slams. Although I question his physical capacity. He could mentally and physically wear down opponents in the past. I don't think he can do that now. 




 It should be illegal to put police sirens in a radio commercial. 




 Most likely final:

Djokavic vs Federer

I'm down with that. 




 It's possible Nadal will need to beat Djok, Murray, and then Federer to win the title.

Damn that's gonna be hard. But if he pulls it off... #greatestever 




 Umm that's only .25%. What about the other 9.75%? 




 For another comparison, an Olympic pool is 660,000 gallons. 




 Just for comparison, an Olympic size swimming pool is 660,000 gallons. So this oil spill is about 1/6th of that. 

Not saying it's OK. Just stating facts. It's still bad when so close to the shoreline. If this spill was in the middle of the ocean, it would have little effect.

 So every time I turn on my camera, it is completely out of focus. It doesn't focus properly until I point the camera at something really far away ( 15 feet). I noticed that it's actually setting the focus to be very short - about 3 inches - every time I turn on the camera.

Any workarounds? 




 Lol no I haven't seen the girl since my senior year in high school. I'm very happy with my wife 




 Hell no.

It took me almost 10 years to realize there was this girl who liked me.

We were on an exchange trip in France, and we split off from the group and went into a plush garden and laid down next to each other. 

She slept on my shoulder on the bus.

She danced with my best friend to make me jealous.

10 years after it happened, when telling the story to my wife, I realized she had tried pretty hard to get me to make a move. I was just totally clueless.

EDIT: For typo 




 I know a lot of Jews over 6 feet. 




 Oh, my wife's a 10/10 for you, too? Ha Ha Ha!

 I want to drop a table, but there are other tables that depend on it (foreign key). Is there a way I can programatically find all such tables, and disable the constraints (temporarily) so I can drop the table? 

EDIT: I did notice there is a table called "USER_CONSTRAINTS". A query like:

    select TABLE_NAME from USER_CONSTRAINTS
       where R_CONSTRAINT_NAME like 'my_table%'; --'%' for trailing space

Returns the 5 tables that have a FK constraint on my table. Not sure what to do with it though.

 EDIT: Shoot I had the bot do 12 years initially.

I'd say there is a 50/50 change more than 5% of cars are self driving in 13 years. Maybe 15 is a bit much. What would the bet be? We'd both have to be on Reddit 15 years from now. There is a Remindme Reddit bot we can use.

 Yea good point. No excuses for being this stupid

 Well that's just mean 




 He clearly does not speak English as a first language. Maybe that's where the breakdown is? 




 There is a difference than finishing their product, and actually getting it used around the world. Obvious problem is cost - not everyone will be able to afford it. Second problem is testing. They only test in 1 or two cities. It would have to be tested ALOT more to be approved for global usage. It will be 15 years before we see more than 5% of cars on the road being self-driving 




 We will be lucky if self driving cars can be purchased and used in more than 1 city 5 years from now 




 This reminds me of when people freaked about us running out of whale oil.

 Forget about it passing. The idea simply doesn't work. What would prevent colleges from raising rates if the government is paying for it all? Do you force colleges to freeze tuition? How do colleges compete if they are all free? How do we afford to pay for all of this? 




 I disagree that we are even close to the point of no return.

And even if that's true - then why would we do anything about it? The point is alarmism does NOT get your point across correctly to those that don't agree with you. Sensationalism works to stir up people who already agree with you, but alienates those that don't. If the end goal is to get things done, then sensationalism is the wrong approach. That's all. 




 This seems to be the theme of US politics, sadly. 




 Yea except that's not what the graph shows, and it's been well over 30 years since our astronomical increase in CO2 usage. We should have seen an exponential increase in temperature - but we haven't. The temperature increase has been linear at best. 




 I don't think they will figure it out, and it is more or less inconsequential to me or them. Not having headlights on is dangerous. Having a blinker on? Slightly annoying 




 So then say that. The, "They pay **more** than their fair share" statement is very misleading. 




 Where did all those people talking about how biased Moody's is?
Hmmm... [These people](http://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/35r73k/chicagos_debt_rating_was_just_cut_to_junk_at/) 




 How can someone who pays general taxes **AND** gas taxes, tollways, permits, stickers, etc - compare to someone who **ONLY** pays general taxes? By definition the drivers pay more. 




   Gas taxes and other fees cover less than half of road maintenance and construction costs. The rest is covered by general taxpayers at all levels of government, so people walking, biking and and riding transit are paying more than their fair share.

Um so that means that those who drive pay gas taxes, AND general taxes. Wtf is this logic? It states exactly the opposite. They pay less. I'm not saying I care, I'm just saying this doesn't prove their point. 




 RemindMe! 5 years "An Antartic Ice Shelf should collapse" 




 People that are passionate about something they think they understand (but don't), while thinking other passionate people also don't understand that thing - scare me. 




 That falls into, "Just go" 




  I also do it if someone has changed lanes and haven't cancelled their signal

Someone that clueless will never figure that out. I would not do that. 




 They can't, but they still will... they won't say anything about it. 




 Also, why do we need to chose between 'downplaying' and 'alarming'? Why can't we just be realistic and say, "Ok, you're right. If we do nothing, we won't see anything bad happen for 25 years (instead of 5). But we can't wait 24 years to fix things. We need to start now". If that was the attitude, I think people would respond better. But I think we also need to be honest and say that the changes that happen don't have to be overwhelming. 

Take for example how we forced US car manufacturers to increase their average MPG in their cars. It has had a strong effect on the demand for gas, and of course the consumption of it. Steps like these should be made. Small, yet significant changes. Republicans would be more willing to listen and actually take some sort of action if Democrats weren't so alarmist doomsday-like. 




 My biggest problem with inconveinent truth (and I noticed it right away was [this](http://imgur.com/dJlYBgm) graph of CO2 vs. Temperature]. My question was, shouldn't then the temperature be 5x higher than it is now? There is a clear disconnect in correlation as soon as CO2 begins to skyrocket. 

My follow up question is always, What is the relationship between CO2 and temperature? It can't be linear, because if it was, we would all be dead. It is likely logarthmic, or sub-logarithmic. In which that case, the temperature increase due to CO2 increase, actually decreases over time.

Which means over time, CO2 has less and less of a negative effect on the temperature over time. Not to mention the earth's population growth is slowing, and consumption of fossil fuel per person is decreasing (more efficient cars, alternative fuel sources). I think that over the next 15 years we will see a very small (if at all) increase in temperature, possibly many years of no change. 

Not to mention CO2 is one of the 5 million factors that contributes to the Earth's global temperature. 

When I tell people I am skeptical of climate change - I am not saying I am skeptical that fossil fuels do not effect the environment - what I am saying is that I am skeptical of *how much* you claim fossil fuels are making on temperature/environment.  




 omg how could I forget.

Edit 2: No really, how could I forget? I once was flashing my headlights to indicate there was a cop behind me. a 1/4 mile later, was another cop. He saw me flashing my lights, and immediately pulled me over. 

He asked me, "Is there something wrong with your headlights sir?". I said no. He ended up giving me a ticket for not having proof of insurance or something. It was a legit ticket, but I wouldn't have gotten pulled over if I hadn't flashed my lights. 




 **Get out of the lane, you are too slow**

You are going too slow for traffic (or maybe you are doing fine), but someone behind you thinks you are going too slow. Speed up, or get out of the lane. However, *if you want confrontation, and you want to put yourself in a dangerous situation, stay in your lane and maintain your speed*.

**Your headlights are off**

Obvious, but it means it is night time, and you forgot to turn on your headlights. Just flip them on, and give a courteous wave/thank you.

**Please go, I'm giving you the right of way**

This could happen at a stop sign. You both came at the same time, and both of you are waiting for the other one to go. If they flip their lights on and off, then they are telling you to go. 

This can also happen when someone has stopped, and is has no intention of going - and just wants you to go.

Either way, it means *just go*

EDIT: How could I forget? I feel this is not used as often anymore, as if cops know you do this, they will pull you over.

**There is a cop ahead**

Someone heading towards you in the opposite direction is indicating there is a cop behind them. Proceed with caution, slow your roll. 




 You're right. 2013 - Al Gore said it, and a lot of people bought it, and perpetuated it.  




 In rare cases where there are bad batches and children become sick. (http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/may/11/mexico-suspends-infant-vaccines-after-two-babies-die-and-29-fall-ill)[This] just happened recently in Mexico. I'm not an anti-vaxxer. I'm just making a comparison. 




   The Antarctic Ice Shelf is going to collapse within 5 years.

Is part of the 2nd highest comment here. ONE arctic shelf (of dozens) will melt in 5 years. But the notion is that 5 years from now, everything will go to hell. That's not concern - that is alarmist. Concern is important, but it doesn't help when you over exaggerate 




 That de-escalated quickly... 




 The point is - it is alarmist. And I think that's why many people are skeptical of climate change. Not skeptical as in "I don't think it happens". More like, "I know climate change exists, but they are exaggerating it a lot". If I only read the top 3 comments and their replies, I would think 5 years from now the world will end. It couldn't be further from the truth. 

Remember how Al Gore said the Polar ice cap would melt by 2014 (or 2015? I don't know, but exactly, but that time has passed). Back then most climate change supporters would repeat the same claim. It turned out not to even be remotely true.

If climate change supporters were more *realistic* and less *alarmist* then I think we could have legitimate discussions. Instead what we get is:

"THE WORLD IS ENDING IN 5 YEARS"

"YOU SAID THAT ALREADY 5 YEARS AGO, SO I KNOW YOU ARE LYING, AND WILL IGNORE EVERYTHING YOU SAY, EVEN IF MOST OF IT IS TRUE" 




 Weren't we told the ice caps would melt by 2014?  




 Statistically you are better off having a Rabbi do it compared to having it done at a hospital. Lower botch rates. Not to mention the health benefits.

 Glad to see some recruiters are reasonable. I've heard most of them are slimeballs. 




 You seem to discount that MANY poor/middle/lower-middle class people rent apartments. Increasing property tax will easily increase someone's rent from $900 to $950 or even $1000. This can be a really big hit that will effect those who really can't afford much more.

This also has a side effect of people having less money, which means they spend less - and the government collects less. Not significantly, but you can't discount that it slightly diminishes the return.

 What if it's really that S   P and Fitch have an extreme left-wing agenda, and Moody's is actually the only one reporting objectively?
