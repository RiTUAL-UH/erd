 I will watch some foreign movies, but i 'm worrying about the understanding of the words without the subtitle.  




 Harry Potter has always been my brother's favorite movie. The spinoff film obviously will make him excited.  




 Hope they can create an excellent movie for us. Looking forward to this movie.  




 So you guys are interested in horror films? I have to say that I won't watch horror films alone. I would ask my friends or my brother to watch them with me.  




 Some believe that this green color seems to be used to describe where their powers came from. However, I am still a little bit confused that this is the volcano so that the green color may be unreasonable.

 It's so cute and lovely. BTW, I think it looks more like a dinosaur than a dragon.  









 Well, i think some animals may cry, too. but just not in front of human beings, or not as a baby but the adult. such as lions, apes, tigers and so on. Baby born with the human nature and since they were first brought to the world, they need to cry to announce he/she was alive and healthy. therefore, i think baby's crying is forgivable.  




 I won't mind talking about salary with my friends. I think by talking about our salary, we can know the welfare in different workplaces so that we may have the chance to choose a better job for ourselves.  









 As a girl, now I know all these movies. next time if I were asked to watched one of these movies, i think i would think twice to figure out whether i would agree or not.  




 what's the differences between 8mm, 70mm and other size?  




 Two men kissing? Did you cut it down?
