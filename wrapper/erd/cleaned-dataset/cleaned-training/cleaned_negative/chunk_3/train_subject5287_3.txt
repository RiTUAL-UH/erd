 Hey guys,

So today I've received the unfortunate information that my cat could possibly have lymphoma. I've done a little research pertaining to animals being treated for terminal cancers and being given marijuana and also done a little research on the effects of CDB (Cannabidiol) and treatment with various cancers in humans. Does anyone know or have a recommendation about any venders selling a strain of marijuana high in CBD and low in THC? Any marketplace is fine... Thanks guys. :)

TL:DR cat might have lymphoma, need recommendation on vendors selling marijuana with a high percentage in CBD.
