Seralini ran a bastardization between a sub chronic toxicity study and a carcinogenicity study, with using only 10 rats per sex per group and running it for 2 years.  
  
Also Seralini did not run any statistical analysis on mortality or tumor prevalence. His data, due to sample size and short duration was inadequate to determine if any of his observed effects were statitically significant.

The retraction statement could have been clearer, and should have referred to the relevant COPE guidelines.

**TLDR:** Seralini's 2012 study is full of elementary mistakes and follows an inadequate protocol that fails to support the conclusions it makes. 




 A big issue with the rat (Seralini) study was the very small sample size, it was small enough that they were unable to do any statistical analysis on tumor prevalence and mortality.  




 Monsanto has never sued over accidental cross pollination, they've sued over willful and intentional isolation of their seed and growing without a license.  




 and that their conclusions were predetermined (e.g., pseudoscience).
  
[Citation Needed] 




 Just to point out that the study that WTCMolybdenum4753 is citing was originally retracted for being of fundamentally flawed study design and conclusion.  




 That's because most GMOs such as corn are hybrids and don't bread true, [you get a similar effect with non GMO hybrids.](http://www.researchgate.net/publication/41560478_TRANSGRESSIVE_SEGREGATION_IN_F2_GENERATION_OF_MAIZE_HYBRIDS_GROWN_FOR_GRAIN_AND_SILAGE) 




 Yes, while there was a time in which sterile seeds/GURT was being developed they have never been brought to market.  




 This is due to them being hybrid varieties, not to being genetically engineered.  




 I stopped caring about Goodall when it came out that she plagiarized her book.  




 Seralini's study was retracted for being fundamentally flawed and down right worthless.  




 The WHO and Lancet studies should be honestly looked at and considered without prejudiced.
  
They are the same study.

 I didn't call glyphosate a carcinogen.

 [Here is a point by point response to the book/film Genetic Roulette.](http://academicsreview.org/reviewed-content/genetic-roulette/) 




 Yes, some of them are written or funded in part by Monsanto but not all of them. One of the larger ones cited "the AHS" is [not.](http://aghealth.nih.gov/collaboration/) 
  
Also just because a study might be funded or authored by someone who has a conflict of interest does not mean that the science is flawed or inadequate.  




 What developed nations actively ban the use of glyphosate?
  
 There have been issues with farmers dying from direct contact with it since it came into use.
  
The only real cases of farmers dying from glyphosate exposure are easily suicide related when the farmer consumes large amounts of a concentrated solution.

 According to Argentina's union of medical professionals, Fesprosa, glyphosate, not only causes cancer. It is also associated with increased spontaneous abortions, birth defects, skin diseases, and respiratory and neurological disease.

There was no evidence of a carcinogenic effect related toglyphosatetreatment. The lack of a plausible mechanism, along with published epidemiology studies, which fail to demonstrate clear, statistically significant, unbiased and non-confounded associations betweenglyphosateand cancer of any single etiology, and a compelling weight of evidence, support the conclusion thatglyphosatedoes not present concern with respect to carcinogenic potential in humans.

Note that there was a weak but slight association with multiple myeloma that the authors suggest that further follow up is required. Also this was among applicators who inherently are exposed to significantly higher amounts of glyphosate than end product consumers.

  
Also a re-analysis of the AHS data failed to show the same link between glyphosate and multiple meyloma.

[Epidemiologic studies of glyphosate and cancer: A review](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273230012000943)
  
To examine potential cancer risks in humans, we reviewed the epidemiologic literature to evaluate whether exposure to glyphosate is associated causally with cancer risk in humans. We also reviewed relevant methodological and biomonitoring studies of glyphosate. Seven cohort studies and fourteen case-control studies examined the association between glyphosate and one or more cancer outcomes. Our review found no consistent pattern of positive associations indicating a causal relationship between total cancer (in adults or children) or any site-specific cancer and exposure to glyphosate.

 The few times that I've used the base 5k I've noticed it a little during certain task. Also several reviews have also documented slight performance issues with the base GPU. The performance of the base might not be too big of an issue to you, but that is heavily dependent on the kind of work/programs you will be using.  




 The McLaren F1 is also a lot more expensive and rare then the LaFerrari.  




 There are a handful on the open market, and while Ferrari claims to make "x" amount of their hyper cars they rarely do. The Enzo sold a good 60+ beyond their official figure.  




 Stig's problem was due to the car not being set up properly in terms of its suspension.  




 You do know that GMO tomatoes don't exist on the market right? 




 There are several on the used market already.

 I'd stay away from the 5K unless you are going for the top of the line version. The base mobile GPU is going to struggle pushing that many pixels.

 Monsanto has never sued over accidental cross pollination of their crops. 
  
About the Schmeiser case.  

 I'll quote the actual court case.
  
[In late June or early July of 1997, Mr. Schmeiser and his employee Carlyle Moritz hand sprayed Roundup around power poles and in the ditches along the Bruno road where it bordered fields 1, 2, 3 and 4. This was part of his normal weed control practice. Several days after the spraying, he noticed that a large number of canola plants had survived the spraying. To determine why the canola plants had survived the Roundup spraying, Mr. Schmeiser conducted a test in field 2. Using a machine sprayer set to spray 40 feet, he sprayed Roundup on a section of field 2 in a strip along the road. He made two passes, the first weaving between and around the power poles and the second adjacent to the first pass, parallel to the power poles. He testified that by this means he sprayed a good three acres of field 2. According to Mr. Schmeiser's evidence, after some days, approximately 60% of the canola plants sprayed were still alive, growing in clumps that were thickest near the road and thinner as one moved into the field.[23]At harvest time in 1997 Mr. Schmeiser, who was then recovering from a leg injury, instructed Mr. Moritz to swath and combine field 2. Mr. Moritz did so, harvesting the canola in the field as well as the surviving canola along the roadside. The harvested seed was put into the box of a 1962 Ford pickup truck. The box was covered with a tarp and the truck with its tarped load of canola seed was stored in one of Mr. Schmeiser's buildings over the winter.[24]Mr. Schmeiser testified that in the spring of 1998 the seed from the Ford truck was transferred to another truck and taken to the Humboldt Flour Mill for treatment, a normal process to rid the seeds of disease before planting. The treated seed, mixed with untreated seed from his granary ("bin-run seed"), was planted in all or part of each of his nine fields, for a total of 1,030 acres.](http://decisions.fca-caf.gc.ca/en/2002/2002fca309/2002fca309.html)  
  
  
His crop did not magically become 95-98% RR canola purity overnight and the court realized this. Schmeiser was not sued over accidental cross pollination, but over intentionally isolating RR canola plants and planting the seed the following year.
