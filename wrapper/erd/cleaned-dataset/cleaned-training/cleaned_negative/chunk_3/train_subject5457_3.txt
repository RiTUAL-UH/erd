 Maybe this person told everyone razors shouldn't cost $5 a piece.

 I feel the same way.  I have four kids.  Need to take a loan just to afford tickets and food.  God forbid it's 3D or imax..

 I always liked the Batman Wonder Woman dynamic from JLU cartoon. 




 Agree with you.  Too many apps with this requirement.  Wish the developers would just charge more for the game instead of trying to nickel and dime you as you play. 




 Glad everyone enjoyed it as much as I did.

 Does anyone know the synopsis of this story?  I am behind on Batman arcs. 




 I posted the link to the original source.  Thank you.

 i very much enjoyed Book 1.  When he finally reaches Walter towards the end of the book and gets the cryptic 'explanation' I was hooked on the series. 




 settle down, its all good.  i will remove it.  no need to be negative. 




 It was written by Grant Morrison 




 i think she is sexy and funny.  I am excited to see her in this movie if it the deal goes down.

 You can now take burst selfie photos. Isn't that what we all wanted? 




 That's fantastic. Thank you.   




 It's futurama though. I love that show 




 That could be about Mansfield.  I do know that Monroe was voracious reader that really enjoyed Tolstoy as well as others.  Regardless it is impressive that the rumor of her IQ is out there given her background.  Especially her early childhood years.  Thanks for researching.

 Thank you.  Fascinating story. Excited to see it.  




 Never heard of it.  What's it about? 




 I played Putt Putt at the Circus.  Loved it.   




 Payment options were Visa/Mastercard.  Imagine the frequent flyer miles... 




 Love those things.  Never enough in the crystal candy bowl  




 i do.  http://giphy.com/gifs/dswr4dRQtEzf2
 




 it's a very good book.  Interesting take on war from a completely unorthodox point of view.   




 Most impressive part is having only one drink.   




 Should have challenged Cheney 




 Amulet series. Saltwater Taffy series. Shazam by Jeff Smith.  Runaways by Brian K Vaughn.   




 Agreed. He looks huge.  




 'Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal' by Christopher Moore.  A wonderful story about friendship, love and forgiveness.  It is also one of the funniest books I've ever read.  I was raised a catholic but no longer follow any religion but after reading this book I think Catholicism would be better served following Joshua, Biff   Mary.  The book certainly gave me reason to pause and think about certain things.  Highly recommend the book.   




 Sorry don't know why it's doing that worked on my end the first time.  Try to fix it 




 IGN headline sorry  




 she's hiding her stump from the recent shark attack in this photo 




 Thank you 




 denied as well for both practice round and tournament.  Maybe 2016 will be my lucky year. 




 Brave and Bold was good for it's team-up characters. Brought out a lot of DC characters and stories that may have otherwise never been utilized in an animated show.  The JLU was by far and away my favorite batman. 




 Will do. Thanks for the heads up 




 That's funny as hell 




 I just felt Grant Morrison's run on Batman with Williams, Quitely and Kubert was one of the most influential Batman arcs in recent memory.  Whether people like it or not can be debated but the artist were top notch.  I read the introduction and qualification but Bruce Timm defined Batman for a generation with BAS. 




 Loved the original Pikmin. Now my kids play it. Very generous of you.  




 Dark Tower series by Stephen King (7 long books) made me very sad when it ended. Invested a lot of time and emotion into those books. Each and every character became a member of my family. I've read the series twice. The second read was just as emotional and heartfelt as the first.   




 100 Bullets by Brian Azzarello
The Exterminators by Simon Oliver
Stephen King's the Dark Tower by Peter David
The Boys by Garth Ennis 




 Seems like it would be a cleaning nightmare.  




 Bring it back!

 Damn, sorry didn't see it.  Thought it was interesting.   No reason to get nasty.   




 he reminds of this guy! http://goo.gl/mFc2bb
 




 i agree with you on the utility bill.  He has only one child.  Lot of space for three people (really 2 people because he's on the road 40+ weeks a year). 
He seems like a nice guy.  Stopped and talked to my 12 year old boy during a practice round of a tournament for a few minutes and gave him a signed golf ball.   




 Great picture.  




 I read that article as well and thought the same thing when I saw this license plate 




 Congratulations great shot! 




 Just saw it today for the first time today  




 No idea.  Hoping someone would know as well.

 Jealous. Two my favorites as well.  




 sorry.  thanks for letting me know. 




 The fight with Ed Norton alone wants to make me see this movie. 




 You and I would be excellent cart partners 




 please make more.  those are wonderful 




 Agreed. Seemed a bit strange. Wonder if Warner Brothers will step in and shut it down? 




 My favorite, "Take a look at the staff on the way in  thats the last youll see of them" 




 Sorry just saw this today  




 Artie Lange 'Jack and Coke' is absolutely hilarious 




 I didn't realize it was an article from 4/1. My apologies.  Just read it for the first time today.   




 did you make it?  It's beautiful 




 Looks good.  When will it be available? 




 Here is a link to the full story in the WSJ. http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303636404579395532755485004?mod=e2fb 




 Agreed much better 




 great collection.  love it. 




 Thank you.  I will give it read later today.  I've been wanting to pick up this book so happy to read a review prior to making the plunge.   




 Actually read somewhere they're making a Popeye CGI movie. 




 Where did you get those cases?  I really like them.  




 Batman 




 My son got this backpack for a Christmas present. It's bada$$.  




 Wtf did I just watch?  




 You can't have sex with raw meat on AMC? 




 i want one as well.  beautifully done. 




 She does look a lot like her.   




 Bob should play Batman in the new Superman/Batman movie. 




 They're all beautifully drawn and colored. The Batman Beyond is my favorite.   




 Sorry, I don't but will look to see if I can find it.   




 Love that comic and very glad it was extended past it's original 5 issue run.

 My 12 year old son just finished his science fair project this weekend.  It was hell.  He did all the research, report, etc. on his own but organizing, editing, reviewing, etc. took many hours.  Then after all that you need to put the god damn poster board display together.  One kid down three to go.   




 It's basically vanilla with red and blue food coloring.   




 i had not read about the release of a new big bertha driver until yesterday.  i apologize. 




 me too! 




  He's 8 years old.  There are numerous saints named Robert.  We were searching together to select a favorite.   




 I bet your right! 




 Film looks interesting.  Hard to believe these kids are only 7 years old.  here is the trailer.  http://theshortgamemovie.com/ 




 Difficult to determine.  Seems like we are right back where we started with some many different universes within DC.  Earth 2, Earth, Injustice, Future, etc.   




 Movie was so good but it the first 15 minutes were incredibly touching and emotional.   




 sorry,  that was just the headline from the article.  you're right. 




 Thank you.  I will add to the itinerary.   




 Have not played the course.  Just saw it for the first time.  After seeing it, I am going to try to make time this summer to travel there and play the course.  It looks amazing. 




 I miss Fairly Odd Parents.  Funny show. 




 Beastie Boys "Girls" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6otiLxT34DQ 




 and steamy 




 Yes, that is what I gathered from the video.  You put it in much easier (and better) terms than me. 




 second one always made you feel sick but i always ate it 




 your comment reminds of this far side cartoon - http://i.imgur.com/pdfjcen.png 




 Damn straight! 




 i've had plenty of McRibs in my lifetime.  Just didnt know that is was made from tripe, heart and stomach.   




 that's clever and funny 




 Just register with Titleist. I bought D2 Driver last year.   




 Amazing how many of those $60 a dozen balls you can find on a golf course 




 I understand that.  I have a backlog of books waiting to be read.  Dark Tower is the only books that I've re-read but I have friends that can re-read books numerous times.   




 ive seen quite a few but not many of the older ones on the list. 




 me too.  looking forward to it. 




 That's funny 




 I have this years model and love them.  First set of Mizunos I've owned and hard pressed to go back to anything else.  




 it says in  the title, "This is What Mega Charizard Looks Like in Pokmon X   Y"  you don't want the game to be spoiled don't click.  sweet Jesus use some common sense 




 My kids own a Wii U and love it. So I guess I care... 




 its the article.  not the video 




 I'm not sold on him either 




 hard to find anyone playing better golf than him right now.  19 years old or not.
