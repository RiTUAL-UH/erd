 When I finished Brave New World, I had to stop reading for a month. I was 16 at the time and it was the most impressed and ethically challenged that I had felt with any book. Trying to read other books after that experience was a little unfair so I just had to stop for a while.

 The library near where I live received a donation of about 10 dark horse star wars omnibuses, when I was in high school. I still get them out and read them a couple of times a year.
