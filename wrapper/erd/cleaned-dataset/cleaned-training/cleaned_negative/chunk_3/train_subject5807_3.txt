 Thanks for adding that! I can see how my title could be misconstrued. 
























 Before clicking, I thought this was going to be one of those "that's terrible but kinda funny" posts but this is actually heart-wrenching. You have to feel for Vin Diesel. 














 That's one fiiiiiiiiiiine piece of [forced perspective](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_perspective) 




 For a laugh, go to the video section and watch the spokesperson try to talk up the machine while on it -- you can barely understand him because his voice is shaking in and out.

I'd wager this might impart small boosts to bone density, but as far as increasing aerobic capacity or losing weight, the effects will most likely be negligible.

 Found a terrific study in PubMed:

**Lifetime exercise and disk degeneration: an MRI study of monozygotic twins.**

Study: "...the effects of power sports were investigated in 12 discordant [twin] pairs (2,300 vs 200 h of weightlifting). The age range of the twins was from 35 to 69 yr.

Finding: Increased power sport participation was associated with slightly greater disk degeneration in the lower thoracic spine, but not in the lumbar spine.

 This press release is terribly written.

Something to remember: Not all fat is created equal. Visceral fat, which coats internal organs in the abdominal cavity, is far more dangerous than subcutaneous fat, which is stored just underneath the skin. It doesn't look like the study made any effort to differentiate the two.

Addition: Yowzers. Nobody seems to like this comment. Here's information to back up what I'm saying. From the Harvard Medical School:

"Abdominal, or visceral, fat is of particular concern because its a key player in a variety of health problems  much more so than subcutaneous fat, the kind you can grasp with your hand. Visceral fat, on the other hand, lies out of reach, deep within the abdominal cavity, where it pads the spaces between our abdominal organs."

 How do I assign flair to this? I don't see a bright yellow box under the submission... (Browser = Firefox)

Update: Looks like somebody else did. Thanks! 














 My girlfriend lost about twenty hair ties to my roommate's orange tabby.  









 TL;DR

 Exactly. We've always known that muscles atrophy after disuse -- muscle is physiologically expensive for the body to maintain. What's incredible is how fast the body does away with them. 




 Precisely. I don't think people have to worry about wasting away from just days off at the gym. 




 Here's an interesting new study:

"Substantial skeletal muscle loss occurs during only 5 days of disuse."
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24168489

What did the researchers do?

"Twenty-four healthy, young (231 y) males were subjected to either 5 (n=12) or 14 (n=12) days of one-legged knee immobilization using a full leg cast."

What did they find?

"Quadriceps muscle CSA declined from baseline by 3.50.5 (P0.0001) and 8.42.8% (P0.0001), leg lean mass was reduced by 1.40.7 (P=0.07) and 3.10.7% (P0.01), and strength decreased by 9.02.3 (P0.0001) and 22.92.6% (P0.0001) following 5 and 14 days of immobilization, respectively."

The takeaway: It's amazing how fast muscles atrophy after only five days of total disuse! 



















 58% approval is nothing to scoff at, though. Polls never reached anywhere near that in the 60s, as far as I know. 



















 RealClearScience actually interviewed the author of the paper. (Link: http://www.realclearscience.com/blog/2013/10/40-years-of-government-nutrition-data-may-be-flawed.html)

Here's what he said about the Coca-Cola funding: "Archer explained that it's an unrestricted research grant. In other words, the soft drink maker contractually has no input or say in what he researches or publishes."

I actually think that Coca-Cola wouldn't like the findings of the paper, because it's actually saying that people eat MORE calories than they think. Hmm now I wonder where those calories come from... soda maybe?
 









 For all those people eating paleo diets thinking to themselves that calories in vs. calories out doesn't matter, this study reported that obese people UNDERESTIMATED their intake by about 800 calories a day. So the largest individuals in society are actually eating a lot more. Thus -- if true -- the results of this study seem to further reinforce the USDA's general stance on obesity, that we just need to eat less and exercise more.

Study is here, btw: http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0076632 




 Glitch Gaming, an organization at the University of Minnesota, did this at the local BWWs on campus for the LCS Championship. The joint was actually at capacity, with 90% of the people there to watch the LCS. It was a blast!!!!! 




 Thanks to Tom Clancy's Hunt for Red October, Sean Connery played a Lithuanian submarine captain -- Marko Ramius -- resulting in the best accent mash up of all time.
