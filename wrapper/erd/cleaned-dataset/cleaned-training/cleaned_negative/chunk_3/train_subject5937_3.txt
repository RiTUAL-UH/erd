 This study had several limitations. 

First, we did not have adequate numbers to examine suicide trends in some specific subgroups 

Second, changes in cause of death coding might have affected our findings, 

Third, the study was not designed to determine whether changes in suicide rates in black and white children corresponded to periods of change in risk factors for suicide. 

Fourth, it is **unknown whether the accuracy of classification of a death as suicide in children has changed during the study**

"A Hammerhead Shark was the first shark known to demonstrate asexual reproduction (where a female produced young without the input of a male). In addition, they are one of the few animals, along with pigs and human beings, that can suntan as their skin becomes darker with increased exposure to harmful rays when swimming close to the waters surface."

 "When a dog bites a man, that is not news, because it happens so often. But if a man bites a dog, that is news."

 If you are only married 6 years, I believe there *usually* is not alimony (depends on which state). If you were married 10+ years then absolutely. 

If you have a child then absolutely to child support regardless of length of relationship (or even if you were married or not).

 **Tater Tots** - those were always the best!

 The purpose of the student loan is to provide future benefit (the fruits of the education). Since the ex-spouse will not be able to participate in the future benefit, both statues and court rulings state that, in general, student loans within a marriage are individual debts, not joint debts. There are exceptions, but that is the rule.

Example: If my wife puts me through medical school with $250,000 in student loans, then after 6 years of marriage I divorce her, she does NOT have to pay any of the loans since they will only benefit me - - via future income. 




 I feel a little guilty saying this, but in the grand scheme of things, the loss of our planet's cultural heritage, history, and sites such is this makes me at least as angry as the loss of life.

**Destruction of cultural heritege should be a war crime**. 




 If you watch it in reverse, it's a snail blowing a bubble.  




 THAT - that I have to try! 




 If you are married almost all debts are joint - regardless if the spouse co-signed.

Student loans are one of the few debts that aren't joint within a marriage.  




 Without my knowledge my wife (now Ex) took out $75k in student loans, then filed for divorce.

She honestly thought I would have to pay them.

She took out another $25K+ during the separation and tried to get me to pay that as well.

Oh yah . . . her "degree" is in Children's Literature. Good luck paying of that $100K loan!

 Images released by the U.S. Committee for Human Rights in North Korea this week appears to show several individuals standing in front of anti-aircraft machine guns at a military training area 13 miles north of Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, around Oct. 7, 2014.

It appears that these people are being executed.

"Images released by the U.S. Committee for Human Rights in North Korea this week appears to show several individuals standing in front of anti-aircraft machine guns at a military training area 13 miles north of Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, around  Oct. 7, 2014.

 I don't think so. If that were the case, you would commit a crime if:

I email you child porn as an attachment (the image would be on your PC)

I sneak onto your PC and download the file "train_subject5937 Child Porn" that contains illegal images.

In both cases, the illegal child porn is on your PC, but you have no intent and have not committed a crime - - but I would have. 




 The intent and the individual's actions are very different in the two cases.

1. If Googling "impact of child porn on society" resulted in images being cached, it would be hard to prove intent to download the illegal porn.

2. If in addition, you right click on the child porn and "save image as", then you have clear intent. 




  if you search for it and you see the image hosted on a website 

The Google Search would be within your browser (not actually going to another website). Now, if the browser caches the images to your hard drive, and they remain there, that might be a gray area if a search of your PC was done and they were found. I think you could beat the charges since, by doing a Google search with your browser, you did not intend to, and did not actively download the pictures. 

Source: I'm not a lawyer, but I play one on the Internets.  




  only if you find some

I don't think finding child porn would be illegal. DOWNLOADING it would be illegal. Thus, the search would not be a crime, the act of downloading it would.

(Source - I live in the SF bay area. Talk radio man Bernie Ward went to prison for his child porn "research". He downloaded.) 




 It's tough work finding that path - - keep trying. And creating a budget (and following it) helps. 

A strict budget is the only way I could have made it through college with almost no debt.

I wish you the best of luck.

 Then work hard to either decrease expenses, or increase income (or both) so you can create a larger cushion. 

I'm not trying to bust your balls, but seriously, the security of creating (1) a safety net and (2) savings for the future, will reduce stress and make life much more enjoyable.  




 I think there is a distinction between being a crime, and supporting criminal charges.

1. Clearly a search could be evidence in support of criminal charges (e.g. "how to dissolve a body with lye")

2. Under the Patriot Act, repeated searches on the President's travel plans, combined with searches to hire an assassin, etc. might be prosecutable.  

Other than the Patriot Act or threats on the President, I have a hard time seeing when a search, or even a pattern of searches would be a crime. 




 U.S. News and the Internet site Beliefnet funded a poll to learn more about why, how, where and when people pray. Here is a summary of the findings: 

 75% percent were Christian. 

 64% say they pray more than once a day.

 56% say they most often pray for family members, with 3.3% saying that they pray for strangers.

 A little over 38% say that the most important purpose of prayer is intimacy with God.

 41% say that their prayers are answered often.

 1.5% say that their prayers are never answered.

 Over 73% say when their prayers are not answered, the most important reason is because they did not fit Gods plan.

 5% say that they pray most often in a house of worship.

 79% say that they pray most often at home.

 67% say that in the past six months, their prayers have related to continually giving thanks to God. (Pastors Weekly Briefing, 12/24/04)
 




  Blessings require some work or effort on our part before we can obtain them. Prayer is a form of work and is an appointed means for obtaining the highest of all blessings.

That is beautiful. Thank you for sharing.
