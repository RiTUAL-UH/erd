  this is so valuable

Really? I think it's good enough. 




 If she really wants your help, I would sit down with her, hat in hand. Help her calculate her base numbers and work out an appropriate diet. Once you have that daily caloric number, get her to write down everything that she eats in that day. 

Then with her over your shoulder, count the calories with her. She needs to see the misconceptions that she has about calories first hand. It may be enough of a shock to the system to help her make the right choice.

I've learned to not be surprised by the levels cognitive dissonance that people will have when it comes to their weight. Hell, I was one of those people not that long ago.

Point is, it sounds like she really wants to lose the weight, but honestly doesn't know how. You do though, so send her on the right path :)  




  a Leo

This is worse than the Oscar snub.


Jokes aside, really good post :) 




 I feel like both of those rules could be collapsed into one rule. 




 Cheers, it's starting to get quite a few responses :) 




 "Your safe what?" 




 Telecommunication.

YOU CAN INSTANTLY TRANSMIT A SENTENCE TO ANYONE ALMOST ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD (AND OFF THE WORLD).

Imagine telling someone from the 1800s that this would be the future. 




 Speak a different language. 




 A semi funny joke about the Australian drinking culture after the cricket world cup lol 




 It actually wasn't cheaper for me. I previously worked somewhere which was a 35 minute drive or a 35 minute train ride. In the end I was driving because of the difference in price.

When driving everyday for work I was going through a tank of fuel every 2 weeks ($90~), this includes personal driving exterior to work driving.

When catching the train everyday, I would spend $55 per week. Thats $110 against the $90 for fuel. So even with maintenance costs of my car, I'm still ahead per week to drive.

That being said, I'm now at a job where I have to catch the train everyday and it's much better for my sanity.

Also, car or train - it doesn't matter, I'm listening to audiobooks. 




 Fucking booze. Holy shit, that is a lot of money wasted. I've been off the booze for the past 3 months and my savings are incredible. Believe it or not, I'm more fun at parties now because I don't blow out before 11pm and I'm down to help people with a ride home. 




 The over saturation of anything on the internet and popular culture. This isn't about a hipster view of "X is awesome because it's unknown", its about over exposure.

A joke is funny the first time, the 100th time it loses its flavour. Game of Thrones is fun to talk about, when every show on the planet makes a reference to it, it starts to lose its flavour. 




 That I'll be remembered fondly by my friends and family 




 Literally a conversation that 12 year old me and 14 year old brother had about a photoshopped Britney Spears photo.

"It can't be her, she's a virgin and that dude is going to town on her"

"Nah man, look closer. It's in the pooper, so shes still technically a virgin"

"Solid point bro"

Edit: My top comment is now about how my brother and I lied to ourselves as teenagers about anal sex. I hope you're happy Reddit. 




 I hope they keep him vegetarian haha

I want to see him munch on lettuce heads like they're grapes. 




 I was totally thinking this! I don't think I've heard him swear in the show before. 




 And the Lord Commander of the Nights Watch always gets the best wine and food. Jon Snow, you 1% bastard.

 #occupywall 




 And because you start to morph into Rob Schneider. 




 Oh right. Well I mean you could just not sing the anthem I guess? I don't recall anyone getting detention or anything for not doing it.

We were not told that 'opting out' was an option
 




 I wish those shows would put more emphasis on the most important part - diet.

But the show would be boring if you showed each person quietly eating a well portioned meal.

Showing the brutal exertions of exercise isn't going to help anyone. 




 Ahhh the ol' Taylor Swift conundrum. 




 Im getting confused are you talking about scouts? If so, I dont think so? It is a private club so they can make what ever rules they want.

You don't really get that many atheistic conscientious objecting 12 year olds, we'll just say the pledge so we can play with our friends. 




 Not saying 'scouts honour', I mean the mandate we recite. It's similar to the pledge of allegiance actually.

More specifically, the mandate ends with the generic "under god" thing too. As an atheistic teen, I didn't care enough about the words to bother omitted the god line lol 




 I literally did it when reading the title of this thread. I read it and thought "Do I do this?"

Without realising it, I'd just raised both of my eyebrows quizzically. 




 I'm wondering if the legends of Ice Dragons were exaggerated stories of reanimated dragons though. It's an interesting idea I think and fits how GRRM goes about writing 'when myth meets reality'.

Of course, the concept of 'ice dragon' could just be an allegory of Jon Snow (half Stark half Targ = Ice Dragon) 




 I've seen girls do the same thing though, I can't tell you what the intent is from everyone who calls you cute, but I wouldn't shrug it off instantly. 




 I mean, I get patriotism. For a public primary school in Australia, we had a weekly school assembly where we finished it by singing the national anthem, but that's hardly as intense as what the U.S does.

I was in the scouts for most of my childhood and none of us really cares what the scouts honour meant, we just recited it because we were told to. 




 Does anyone know if we're aware of any dragons dying north of the wall?

I know the concept of an ice dragon will probably show up in the series and I'm wondering if that means a specific species of dragon which thrives in the north or an undead dragon which is reanimated.

After this weeks episode, I'm starting to think that if the Others reanimated the old corpse of a dragon, it would be kind of awesome.

 




 My clothes are really starting to look ridiculous on me. I still don't want to buy new ones just yet, I know that in a months time ill be down a size. 




 I get it, we do have to draw a line in the sand however and while that study I mentioned asked an interesting question about the ethics, the current setup is probably what's best.

I think making abortion illegal just ends up hurting society, just like all prohibition does. 




 Now that I'm in the latter half of my 20s, I'm start to appreciate the earlier start times for weekends. I used to sleep in past noon every saturday/sunday. But now sleeping in till 9-10am is plenty.

I've actually started adding a rule where I wont sleep past 10am on Sundays because otherwise I can't get to sleep before midnight Sunday night which fucks my sleep before work on Monday.
 




 Hey guys,

As I said in the title [there is a thread on /r/AskMen about weight loss](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/383czs/gentlemen_of_reddit_who_used_to_be_overweight_and/) and I think it's a good idea for everyone to go post a personal story. We all know how hard it was logging that first calorie, so I hope we can inspire those who're stuck in a rut, health wise.

Thanks 




 Ok, so I'll preface this by saying - I'm by no means no longer overweight or no longer unfit. But for the first time in my life, I'm on my way there. Sorry for the wall of text.

So I've been a fatty fatty boombalatty for my entire adult life. Lots of cognitive dissonance and ignorance towards health caused my situation. At the start of this year, I was 285 lbs as a 5"10 27 yo male.

3 months ago I decided enough was enough. So I did something about it, I did my research and came to realise that **WEIGHT LOSS IS EASY**.

It's so simple, I was wondering why I ever convinced myself otherwise. **Calories in vs calories out**.

That's it. No fads, no pills and believe it or not; no exercise required. (definitely recommended though. Diet is for weight loss; exercise is for health).

I did my calculations, I saw what my daily calorie expenditure was and I started eating under that magic number every day. I quit drinking and started being a little bit more active. Wouldn't you know it, after 1 week of this I lose almost 4 pounds. Fucking magic right?

I think where most people fail is by seeing this as a *diet*. Diet implies a temporary change to allow you to go back to your original lifestyle - **this is why diets fail**. Your lifestyle needs to change **forever**. 

Another fairly common assumption is that you can no longer enjoy the foods you currently enjoy and you have to eat nothing but 'healthy foods'. **This is total and complete bullshit**. My diet has not change all that much, I just eat less. Now saying all of that, you do want to add more balance to your diet. So definitely eat more fruit and vegetables - but don't think you need to have a dinner which consists of a plate of lettuce. That's just silly. You know what my favourite dinner is?

A nice juicy porter house steak with a side of pasta salad and salad/veges. For me that's around a 800-1000 calorie meal and christ is it tasty.

Once you get your food intake undercontroll, you'd be surprised at how this affects your life. A better diet means better sleep which means better energy, which actually makes you **want** to exercise. Crazy right?

As I said, it's been 3 months and I've lost 33 pounds. If I can do it, you can do it. Don't be like me and make excuses. You know what you're doing is unhealthy and you're never going to change unless you do the work.

Please also check out /r/fitness, /r/progresspics and /r/loseit. These subreddits are **fucking incredible**, who says the internet has to be a support-less and judgmental hellhole.

Edit: it looks like someone is auto downvoting people who're saying diet is more important than exercise. Some people like being in their ignorance bubbles. 




 Pretty good, a few weeks ago I decided to fully shave my head. It looks good, but I ended up shaving the beard off too. Bad move, I look like I'm a teenager. I'm growing my beard back now :) 




 How to make people laugh, seriously - I use this more than anything. 




 You say the pledge of allegiance **every morning** at school?

Do 6 year olds even understand what they're reciting and it's  implications? 




 Truth 




 See this depends on context. I (a man) will refer to hot girls as *cute*. It's just my go to word to indicate beauty. 
 




 Ill never forget how that conversation happened, it was kinda hilarious.

I'd just started doing it with my GF at the time, but I'd obviously never told my parents (why would I? It's personal). So after we had broken up, she called me up and told me that she was pregnant (turned out to be BS, she was crazy - another story for another day).

I freaked the fuck out, I was panicking. I couldn't be a dad, she wanted to me drop out of school and be the father and support her, blah blah it was a pregnancy trap, 17 year old me didn't know that though.

So I did the walk of shame to talk to my parents, I sat down with them and through my shame explained the situation. Not shame of having sex, my parents allowed for a healthy attitude towards young relationships, shame towards getting her knocked up.

Anyway, the conversation went like this:

"She's pregnant"

"Oh? Didn't you use protection?"

"Yeah we always used condoms but a few times they've broken"

My dad's retort:

*"How do you break a condom? Doesn't the smell of burning rubber indicate you should slow down?"*

Fucking hell dad, you can't help yourself. That bad joke made us all laugh and I calmed down immediately. I was able to deal with the situation thanks to the coolness of my parents. It turned a stressful situation into a great memory of my upbringing.

Edit: words 




 I'm more worried about your feet than your shoes haha

What a *callous* suggestion  




 One could argue that flip flops are the corner stone of the simple life haha

Nothing says "simple life" quite like walking around with no socks. 




 Crappy beat up shoes for yard work.

I'm the same, I wrote 'work boots' when in reality they're just a old pair of steel toe boots which I couldn't care less about destroying in the yard. 




 You don't own flip flops? But how do you show off your rock'n toes to the ladies. 




  When we combine the two factors, we have a net reduction of violence by 40%.

Yeah, I see where you're going with that. It's about a contribution as opposed to a single reason.

I'm curious to further read studies into that, mainly because I play and watch lots of violent games/movies and so do all of my friends and we all have the same attitude towards actual violence.

I guess the main point is about ones upbringing at the end of the day. My parents taught me to treat everyone as you would want to be treated and no amount of fictitious violence will ever reverse that. 




 I'm more on the practical side, I only own 1 pair of 1 type of shoe:

- Flip flops
- Runners
- Dress shoes
- Casual attire shoes (skate shoes)
- Slippers
- Work boots 




 I'm wondering how many men actually buy shoes solely (pun intended) for practicality.

So how many pairs of shoes do you own? Do you have multiple of the same type? If so, why?

Edit: added clarification 




 I'm not going to try to sway you one way or the other, but a study was put together which caused some stir in the scientific community (can't find the source, sorry)

The experiment was to determine the moment of a newborn's life where they became self aware and conscious beings. Interestingly, they found that children up to 6 months after birth were found to be without self awareness and self consciousness. Here comes the controversial part:

They concluded that (ethically) aborting a 6 month old is no different than aborting 4 weeks into a pregnancy.

Kinda fucked up right?  




 PROHIBITION DOESN'T FUCKING WORK. 

How haven't any countries figured this out yet? 




 The problem is that the second you make the distinction of 'pedophilia is a disease', then you would have to also think 'homosexuality is a disease'. How well has conversion therapy worked for them? Fucking horribly.

Study it all you want, but I don't think it's helpful to stigmatise people on something they can't control or probably don't want. 

Also pedophilia =/= child molester. 




 It brings up the question - If you could get a test 4 weeks into a pregnancy which could determine if the child will be severely autistic, what would you do with that information if it returned positive?

It's a fucking hard question to answer, I couldn't even imagine what I would decide if it were non-hypothetical 




 If that were true, then wouldn't the rate of violent crimes be getting higher while the film/gaming industry is getting larger?

It's true that the rate of violent crimes in first world countries has been on the decline since the 80s 




 I do the same thing, but I **do** make sexual stories. It helps with immersion. Obviously this technique is about distracting your mind from thoughts of "GET TO SLEEP" and having sexy thoughts about who ever is a good way to do that. You would think this keeps you up at night, it surprisingly doesnt lol

Also, turn off all electrical devices in your room. Since I've started doing that, my fitbit tells me that I have nearly zero interruptions to my sleep. I feel so much better with 4 **solid and uninterrupted** hours of sleep over 10 hours of restless sleep. 




 Make a throw away called /u/START_ENJOYING_THINGS. 

You need to get out of your own head man. You can't think of why someone would want to talk to you? Clearly that's not correct, or the girl wouldn't have said yes :)

 They had no TV 




 I like that its a fresh snack which keeps for quite a long time and is very portable.  




 and .*

  roaring crowds

[Spoilers ADWD](/s "We all know what the noise of the roaring crowd is going to do in that episode :D")
 




 Poor OP, you're reminding us all about that time someone asked reddit "Do you prefer sex with or without a condor". 




 It's name is false advertisement. 




 I'm 33 lbs down myself and I can totally see where you're coming from. Although I didn't 'hope it would go away', I was fully aware that *some day* ill  have to do something about my healthy. 

But that *something* was always "next year" or "the year after". Excuses after excuses. It wasn't a good cycle to be stuck in.

Edit: Also, 1987 really was the best year to be born wasn't it ;P 




 Yesterday was 3 months since my first weigh in. I'm 33 lbs down and going strong.

All of my lifestyle changes are now in full affect and a part of my life. I had a house warming party on Saturday and I didn't even have the urge to drink. I was perfectly happy socialising with all of the drunk people and having a good time.

I also was far too excited for my liking about the apple I treated myself to last night lol 




  /thread 




 I'm sure you're a lovely person, who has a wealth of knowledge.

But I'm afraid you're wrong and you should be eliminated from the gene pool. Granny smith master race.

I just wish it had a more manly name, like Shotgun Ninja. 

Edit: Looks like I forgot to add the **/s**, I thought it was implied. 




 I have literally zero drive to do so. I have a normal career drive, social drive and I most certainly have the drive to find a girl and settle down with her.

But I have no want, whatsoever to raise children. Not even my 2 year old niece has changed my opinion. I'm not going to point out the problems with children, that's done alot in this thread. Suffice to say that I would rather spend my days and nights with my friends and loved ones than to raise children.

I'm 27, so there may be time for my mind to change - I can't say for sure. 




 Beer and tequila till the early hours of the morning.

I just so happened to do this the night before the hottest day of the summer. So there I am, 12pm, zero minutes sleep. Sprawled in my boxers in a hotbox of a house, unable to move or do anything but writhe in agony. While my girlfriend is in the bed with me, horny as hell trying to proposition me, but I can't do it.

Not only was this the worst hangover I've ever had to this day. I also had my first experience with saying no to sex. That was an unpleasant afternoon. 




 I (and most of reddit) are there with you, the thing is that we **all** should experience this sense of existentialism. We need the perspective of our own mortality to be able to live our lives well.

Knowing what we know, being dead won't be a problem. What was 1902 like for you?

It's the dying part which will be hard I think, perhaps this fear will change once we get older. But I can't even fathom what being on a death bed must be like.

My larger point is - don't fear death, celebrate life and enjoy your short stay here to the best of your ability! 




 Alot of it is about matching intensity. What the other poster said is right. Go for a closed lipped kiss and work your way to the deeper kiss, its not about shoving your tongue in, its about syncronising a massage between both persons tongues.

I was terrified during my teens of doing it, but it just kind of 'happened' and it felt natural. Been told im quite the kisser by many :) 




 We still don't know for sure how or why Rome fell.

I was shocked to find that out, this massive empire which existed only 1500 years ago - and we don't know what happened to it. There are some big theories. Which vary from rebellion to pestilence, but historians can't seem to agree.

I mean, I read this a few years ago and haven't checked since - perhaps there is new evidence? 




 I'm totally addicted to bass. 




 The answer is garlic. Come on, how good is taking a big wiff of a jar of minced garlic when you stop by the fridge :) 




 I hope you're talking about the books, because that's truly the best redemption arc I've ever seen. By the end of ADWD, you just want to snuggle up with Jaime and watch Netflix. For context, I'm a straight male. 




 So had you have asked me 4 months ago "train_subject5967, how often do you eat fruit  or vegetables?" I wouldn't be able to answer. I just didn't do it, in fact, I always felt kind of ill when I would try.

That seems to have changed. I currently eat twice a day for lunch and dinner and that's normally enough for me. But sometimes if I've had a good workout or if I'm feeling a bit more hungry I would just munch down on an apple or perhaps some carrots in hummus. At first, this didn't really help all that much. But nowadays, I **love** me some fresh granny smith apples (its the best type of apple, don't argue).

It's like my own little desert if I've been a good boy. You know that feeling that we all have had, the feeling of pure delight when you're chowing down on a piece of food which tastes so good that you wish it were never ending? That feeling (for me at least), used to just be reserved for a fatty piece of steak or an ice cold beer. 

Oh how the times have changed :) 




 I had that conversation recently actually, I mentioned that I was trying to lose weight and I got told "The only diet which works is a low carb one."

Tell that to the 34 pounds I've lost. I love my pasta salad and mash potatoes. 




 I cut out most of the beer.

It saddens me how much this makes a difference, I love my beer :(

Nice work though man, I bet you're going through belt buckles like it's going out of style :) 




 I have the same issues man, while the loose skin **will not** stop me from doing what I'm doing, I'm trying to actively prevent that situation from occuring.

There was an AMA last week done by an obesity doctor and I asked about loose skin. [This is what they](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/37l7tf/iama_board_certified_obesity_doctor_who_has/cro665m?context=3) had to say, there is apparently a procedure which can be done outside of surgery. 




 I hope you direct them towards this subreddit, could use some of that support to spill over :D 




 She just has to follow the 2 rules of dating for that to work:

1) Be attractive.

2) Don't be unattractive. 




 Legally required in Australia :) 




 Nice, that's amazing validation for your efforts. Ill just add - make sure you manage your expectations. You will lose weight most weeks, some weeks you'll lose nothing and other weeks it may **look** like you actually gained weight. You need to keep with it, you know it's working, keep at it! 




 From Australia - Animal Kingdom. Go fucking see it, it's one of the best gangster films. Plus, its based on a true story :) 




 My diet is currently 1800-2000 and I'm losing around 2lbs a week. 5'10 253lbs atm.

You'd be surprised how much someones BMR can be when they've let themselves go. 




 I like to ask people who say that why they think anyone would choose to be homosexual.

I would've thought the answer to that would be because "sin". It's fucked up 









 I think there are a couple of factors. Gilly has had a fucked up life and has dealt with rape that entire time, not saying it makes her immune to the threat, but there is probably some sort of conditioning. Also, she knows Sam. Knows him well. Tysha slept with Tyrion - a complete stranger. It's different.

I appreciate the parallel, but I don't think it's the same  




 A fucking frightening hitman 




 It sucks man, but you have to do it if you want to lose weight :(

I was in the same boat, I was drinking **so** much beer before I started losing. I've been sober for the past 3 months (minus 2 parties), the way I see it, I keep telling myself "You did this to yourself, you've had enough beer, it's time to let time catch up".

The reason why my friends can drink like they do is because they didn't have all those years of gluttony that I've had. I see it similar to spending years racking up massive credit card debts, it's time to start paying off that debt - sacrifices have to be made.  




 To give you context on how much I'm in the same boat as you, my stats are 27M/5'10/285220 haha

It's not a deal breaking for losing weight, but I'm curious as to if it's going to be a warzone when I take my shirt off at a normal weight.  




 Nice work man, I have nearly the same stats :)

Hows the loose skin situation? 




 I'm sorry, I know that was a joke, but I had to write that. 

It's ok, we all need to hyper-vent sometimes. 




 There is no shame in slowing down exercise and focusing on your diet, in fact if you're experincing discomfort, that's exactly what I would do. 

When I first started i was walking *everyday* and while it felt great, after a month I started to get pains in my shins because I was trying to ramp up my efforts. I dialed back the exercise to 3 days a week and I felt so much better. And guess what? My weight loss has stayed the same. 

If you do want to keep going, try some lower impact exercises until you lose more weight and gain more muscle. Swiming, boxing, cycling, eliptical, etc. These will all help with your pain issues :)

Also fucking stretch before AND after lol 




 I wish I had done this when I first started, tracking weight is all well and good but it can be deceptive! A pair of calipers won't lie :) 




 Thanks for your response! I've never heard of that procedure before, it sounds promising, especially since I'm not sure I'm vein enough to surgically remove any excess skin :) 




 Hi Doctor,

I'm 3 months into my weight loss regime. I started as a 27 yo male, 5'11 285 pounds. I'm currently 32 pounds down after 11 weeks and I feel great. I do however have some concerns about loose skin, I'm most likely going to have quite a bit of it.

Are there any legitimate methods to reduce loose skin while I'm working towards a normal weight?

Edit: phrasing 




 I'm kinda the same, I only told my close friends. But that's mainly because they already knew. It was such a drastic change in lifestyle that they noticed. 

"Its 1pm on a Saturday, why don't you have a beer in your hand train_subject5967? OMG, are you dying?" 




 #notallcunts 




 They've also never lost the Ashes! Good job Pakistan! 




 I have to say, Lena's *nailed* that smug half smile that Cersei would totally do in all her scenes last episode (Except for the last :D). When she was talking to the sparrow, that shit eating grin was so telling. 




 "We're all aware of the struggles with writing ADWD and the Meereenese Knot. Do you feel that TWOW has had a less obstructive progress by comparison?" 




 I'm so confused, what did you write? I must be an idiot, because I cant extrapolate context from those screenshots 




 But it does all the normal stuff, HR tracking, pedometer, etc 




 Hey guys,

I've had my FitBit Charge HR for 2 months now and it's great! My mum's birthday is coming up soon and she wants one just like it. The thing is that her main source of exercise is a swimming class she does several times a week, and the Charge HR is not water proof. Can you guys think of a good FitBit like device which is water proof?

Thanks. 




 I can juggle, I assume many don't know how to do that.

A few youtube videos and a boring afternoon and you can juggle just like me :) 









 I just don't want to share my "special" moment with another over-emotional infant.

I would recommend not serving alcohol then.

Source: I have loud drunk friends 




 That resolution... So hard to read the words :( 




 I bit my finger nailed my entire life until a few years ago, one day I had enough and just stopped. They look so much healthier now. Sadly due to the years of abuse, the nail is a little bit lower than it should be. Im actually kind of envious of guys with good hands now.

I also quit smoking almost 2 years ago, I'm one of those fuckers who can quit at the drop of a hate no problem though. This time its for good.

I also now brush twice a day and floss/rinse every day.

 




 You have very similar starting stats to me, but I'm 27. So what I'm going to say will be more impacting for you than me.

**Start right now, not tomorrow, not in 2 months. NOW**.

I'm so fucking frustrated with myself for not dealing with this shit years ago, I feel like I wasted my 20s. I posted a quote the other day which sums up this sense of urgency

*"The best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago, the second best time is right now"* 




  You can burn 500 calories doing a lot of things

 I think you'll find hes not being sarcastic and he means that he has 'never thought about it that way before' instead of 'never thought of this before' 




 Nice job man, hows the loose skin situation? 




 SHITS WEAK! 




 It's currently my second favourite sitcom at the moment, it's only **just** behind Silicon Valley in quality. I love that show, I introduced it to several of my mates and they all fell in love with it 




 At first it's indescribable. That mix of butterflies in the stomach and yearning is hard to replicate.

The only other thing that has done anything close to this, is ecstasy. I have done it a few times in my younger days and the most prolific sensation of that drug is the surges of euphoria and happiness. That feeling is what I've felt for a girl I love. 

It's funny when you experience it, because I had fallen for a girl before my first experience with the drug and the second the drug kicked in, I was like "Oh god, I know this feeling... I had this on our 1 year anniversary night". Knowing that I get the same high from a girl that I get from a drug which is designed to release pleasurable hormones in your body is the ultimate  validation for your feelings. 




 Twerking is such a ridiculous fad, please stop.

Working out on the other hand... Yeah, do that ;) 




 ITT: Irony 




 The **correct** way to handle that situation was to suddenly stop making out, look down at your groin and in your best Peter Griffin voice yell ["Uh ohhhh!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44dTHoZk-QQ) 




 I was actually suprised to hear how inexpensive it is. Apparently a 2000 calorie per day weekly pack is $90 AUD. That's actually cheaper than what I currently pay for my weekly food budget.  




 I totally agree, my diet isn't a diet, it's a change of life style. All my dinners are home cooked, I'm playing the long game.
