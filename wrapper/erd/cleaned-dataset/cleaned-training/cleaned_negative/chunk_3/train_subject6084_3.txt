 A lot of questions in that article, but what I'd really like to know is: how much of this ends up in the Toronto mayor's office? 




 Yes, his death penalty was applied proactively. 




 Looking it up because I was curious, [there have been 37 Federal executions](http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/federal-executions-1927-2003), and only three since 1963, one of those being for Timothy McVeigh.

Edit: OP's article gives more info on this as well. 




 Either that or the person who retrieved the samples for testing was a smoker with a cocaine habit...

 It's a good point, perhaps the phrase "transcription factor *recognition* site" should have been used, as is done in the abstract of the article, instead of "binding site". However I am not familiar with the distinction between the two. 




 That abstract is from an accompanying perspective article. The abstract of the actual paper in question is here:

 Exonic Transcription Factor Binding Directs Codon Choice and Affects Protein Evolution

 Genomes contain both a genetic code specifying amino acids and a regulatory code specifying transcription factor (TF) recognition sequences. We used genomic deoxyribonuclease I footprinting to map nucleotide resolution TF occupancy across the human exome in 81 diverse cell types. We found that ~15% of human codons are dual-use codons (duons) that simultaneously specify both amino acids and TF recognition sites. Duons are highly conserved and have shaped protein evolution, and TF-imposed constraint appears to be a major driver of codon usage bias. Conversely, the regulatory code has been selectively depleted of TFs that recognize stop codons. More than 17% of single-nucleotide variants within duons directly alter TF binding. Pervasive dual encoding of amino acid and regulatory information appears to be a fundamental feature of genome evolution.
 




 It does. The research article is [here](https://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6164/1367.full) and says that [codons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code), the three-letter codes in our DNA that stand for an amino acid in protein synthesis, can **simultaneously** code for an amino acid **and** a transcription factor binding site. [Transcription factors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor) control the expression of genes, i.e. turning them on or off. These dual-use codons, or "duons" as they have called them, represent the "second code" that OP's article is talking about. Even though I only just read it, it looks like a big deal. 




 Yes, and it seems that codon bias - the observed preference of some redundant codons over others - may be explained by these "duons", which would be one of the major findings of this paper from a molecular evolution angle. From the abstract:

 Duons are highly conserved and have shaped protein evolution, and TF-imposed constraint appears to be a major driver of codon usage bias.  




 The research article is [here](https://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6164/1367.full). As mentioned in OP's link, it seems that some codons (of which there are 64 in the standard [genetic code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code)), can simultaneously encode an amino acid and a transcription factor binding site. [Transcription factors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor), put very crudely, control how genes are turned on or off. The discovery of these codons with dual use, hence the term "duons", is very interesting.

 For those looking to emigrate to Liechtenstein, bad news, you actually have to live there for **30 years** before you can apply for citizenship. If you want to apply before the 30 years is up, a vote can be taken by the community of residence, however: 

 Final acceptance also requires consent from the Liechtenstein parliament and granting of citizenship by the Prince

which sounds cool. It's all in this [official guide](http://www.llv.li/pdf-llv-scg-broschuere.englisch.pdf) (PDF, page 25.) 



















 If this is the games industry and its media's attempt at revolutionizing awards shows, the revolution will not be televised, or streamed, or happen next year hopefully. How pathetic! 




 A lot of time would be spent in the bathroom, that's for sure. 




 Why block the hospital? I guess there could be radioactive material still on the people's clothes, pockets, so it's probably a precautionary measure. 




 I was skeptical, but here is an archived report from 1979 about these twins:

 Thanks. Good to have confirmation. 









 OP tells a good story, but nowhere in the link does it go exactly as described. Maybe there's a video somewhere where it does, would be fun to see. 




 Help me, why is OP's link to the editing section of the wiki page?

 Apparently they have been taking guns to space for decades (e.g. [this one](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TP-82)). The idea was for self protection in the wilderness after re-entry. 














 The movie must have made an impression. From Reagan's 1986 State of the Union address:

"Never has there been a more exciting time to be alive, a time of rousing wonder and heroic achievement. As they said in the film Back to the Future, 'Where we're going, we don't need roads'."

 There are some pretty impressive pictures of them [in this thread](http://www.28dayslater.co.uk/forums/european-international-sites/5921-diy-guide-your-own-supervillain-hideout-aka-tailrace-tunnel-niagara.html).  









 Yes DNA is still fragmented and assembled with PacBio's own proprietary assembly software HGAP. The advantage of SMRT is much longer read lengths (thousands of bases) compared to Illumina for example (50-150 bases). Despite the lower base calling accuracy of SMRT (although I hear the accuracy is getting better all the time) the longer read length helps with assembly greatly, and I can say from personal experience that this gives some *very* promising preliminary results for genome sequencing. 




 For clarity, it should be also noted that these technologies are just different ways of sequencing sequence fragments. No matter how long they are, especially for SMRT, they still need to be computationally assembled to recover an entire chromosome, for instance. Until someone can rapidly sequence an entire chromosome linearly from start to end, it is still "shotgun sequencing". 




 OK, perhaps in the future, but there's no way these technologies are routinely used for genome sequencing now, especially novel genomes, which was my initial point. 




 Huh? All next generation sequencing technologies sequence short random fragments of a larger DNA (or RNA, now) molecule, which are then assembled in silico to recover the larger sequence they came from. This is the essence of shotgun sequencing. 




 OP's link is explicitly about the project resulting in the first draft human genome, which finished in 2000. The X prize didn't start until 2006. 




 This is partly due to competition from Celera Genomics, Craig Venter's private company, whose improved method, shotgun sequencing, is now routinely used for genome sequencing. This article doesn't seem to mention this at all.
