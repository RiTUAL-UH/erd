 Eh, the doctor said I didn't show any signs of having schizophrenia, he said that it's most likely caused by my lack of sleep...which I honestly like to believe is the cause. 

The only reason they bother me so much is that I have had sleep hallucinations it's normally the same thing, which is that objects will turn into snakes. It startled me the first time my pencil turned into a tiny snake, but now I'm so used to it that when it does happen I just ignore it.

Insomnia is a bitch hun! lol

But in all seriousness...I honestly don't know why I see these things, I don't think I'll ever know. 

Which might be for the best. O.o
