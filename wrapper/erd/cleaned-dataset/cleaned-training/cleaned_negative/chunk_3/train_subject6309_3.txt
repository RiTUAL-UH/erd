 Thanks! Yeah, I work in an urban school, so my school can assist with any of the funds, but I would very much like a similar pay raise.  




 Lovely! I love how the characters actually look like themselves.
Sometimes tattoos distort their faces...not this one ! 




 I am currently a second year teacher (who desperately wants to enroll in grad school). 
For more experienced teachers, when would be the best time to go back for grad school?(3rd year? 4th year? Now?)
Any helpful ideas would be greatly appreciated!
