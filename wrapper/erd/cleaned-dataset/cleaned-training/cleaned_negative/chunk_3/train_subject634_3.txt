 He has Kazunoko, Tonpy and Super_uriajjo in his Quarter Final pool for potential opponents. Good luck to him :( 




 Damn I missed that...that sucks then :(

Still a pretty cool idea if it actually happened some day. 




 GREAT IDEA. If both this and Luffy vs Santarou Man are streamed on Mad Catz in Day 2 EVO, this might be the first I'll ever watch an EVO on Saturday. 

Also, Angelic's idea of Edition Select for the iterations that each respective EVO champion won with is ingenious. Fuudo with Fei Long AE would win this pretty easily though.  




 The average player from Japan is better than the average player from US. I'm tired of seeing no-name matches on stream while all the higher-profiled players getting blown up off-stream. This is purely from a spectator mindset. 




 Filipinoman's C14 pool is no joke either. His 3rd potential opponent is a a very strong Japanese cody player, Sidou13.

This potential match should also be streamed.

Daigo's pool looks simple and seems to have mostly unknowns. But you are dead wrong. He has some pretty strong possible Japanese players to contend with:

- baby nine (#8 BP ranked Guile in Japanese Arcades)
- Aiai ( (#4 BP ranked Juri in Japanese Arcades)

These matches should also be streamed. 




 Dark Jiewa is no better if not same level as Chris Tatarian in Ken play so this isn't surprising due to his experience against the character.  




 Don't forget Tampa Bison whipped Infiltration at Final Round 18. Beat his Akuma and Decapre too. 




 I would even say Shinba abel is better than Shiro but I still feel like 801strider is the best abel in the world. Those whiff punishes and anti-airs [](/Kreygasm) 




 If there's gonna be 2 streams for SF, the CapcomFighters stream should have James Chen and Ultra David, while the srkevo1 streams should have Seth Killian and Zhi (but he has to be restraint)
