 I don't even know anymore :*( I can't do anything with the PLL plot. 




 I think Mona was lying. We'll have to wait and see if the writers and Marlene make sense of it all. 




 We'll see in the finale. They haven't really shown anything before Allison went missing that has to do with her family other than that Charles clip. 




 Jason was the cause of Charlie's death.

Jason got locked away in Radley.
Jason saw Marion get pushed by his mom.
Jason assumed the Charlie persona.
Jason's mom got him out of Radley.
Bethany dies.
Jason reassumes Charles Persona.
Alison comes back, Charles starts working with Marion.

Charles is Jason.
