 *I know.* 




 I meant frozen *or* artificial.  I'm not really talking about *fish* being artificial, although I never did understand some people's love for imitation crab meat. 









 That is so sweet. 




 Fine hair is more fragile than coarse hair, it would be an even worse idea for fine hair. 




 It's definitely a good example of how a first episode can pull you in.  I was sad when it got cancelled.

 I use WD40 and I think it works great, it cleans them without drying them out, or rusting them.   




 I don't think that is crazy.  Black propaganda.  That's the way I feel about Alex Jones. 




 I meant "triangle."  Like, as to get into a car in the game Grand Theft Auto... I'm not too creative I guess.  









 The cop was the main actor in "The New Guy."  Do not know his name.  




 Products and treatments might make it feel a little better, but there's no way to just *rebuild* hair.  

That amount of damage has to be from something you're doing. .. Flat iron?  Color?  Constant swimming in chlorine?  

Whatever it is, find the root of the problem, stop doing it and just gradually grow and trim it until it feels amazing again.  It will take a while, but if you want to keep your hair a decent length you'll have to be patient.  




 Not only do some women like to have dry hair, sometimes they have an unruly texture and have to smooth it down with a round brush.  Women might have too many things, but these aren't negotiable to most.   




 Well if they'd make all fuckin' counters just a little bit bigger...

 I don't know if I agree with this.  I charge $150 for roots, partial, cut, blowout.  If I wanted to help a friend, even if I went to their house, I would never expect $150.  

It's really nice to receive the same, but if you're going to call it a friendly favor, where does that part come out.  The comfort of their house doesn't even do anything for me, I'd much rather have a comfortable shampoo bowl and salon chair so I'm not making them uncomfortable or breaking my back.

When I do hair for people at their house, it's something nice I like to do if they have kids and can't make it in, or if they are unable to drive.

But when it comes to maybe cutting them a break on the price, I would definitely have them come to me, so on top of me taking some off their bill, I'm not wasting my own gas to do it.  

I think a fair amount to pay would be 60-80% of what they would normally charge.  If he didn't tell you a price he probably wouldn't even expect that much, and he'd be thrilled. 




 That's... not safe. 




 Nice!

 Hey now!  Atheism isn't infringing on equal rights, atheism isn't telling you what birth control they think is appropriate or not.  Atheist's don't have places of worship to gather and molest children, or collect money tax-free.  


Yes, piss on all those people.  I wish we could be a live and let live world. 




 There's just some things you don't talk about in public. 




 Ambient temperature can't keep the blood flowing to your extremities to make them warm.  Your blood keeps you warm.

 Maybe poor circulation.

 OPs hair looks a lot more like Ronald Reagan's or Desi Arnez's than it does [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comb_over).

It's fine that you think it's too subtle to be a pomp(which I disagree with considering the examples wiki shows), but it's definitely not a textbook "comb-over." 




 I first agreed with you, then I read the part of the wiki article where it mentions men with the "pomp," and most of those men's haircuts aren't huge and exaggerated.  I think modern descriptions have changed how we define it.  OP's might not be huge, but I think you could call it a pomp, mini pomp. 




 Perfect explanation.  




 Personally, even if there were 20 parachutes, I'd still never jump out of a plane. 




 That argument isn't really ideal.  Of course motorcycles are dangerous.  But the fact that you have 60 seconds to make a decision, that high up in the air, is pointless if your parachute isn't going to function.  Which is certain death.  I don't think skydiving is, in any way, an irrational fear. 




 You should definitely do an AMA.

 P.s. I love you.

 The premise is what got me interested.  I agree that the very beginning was watchable, but it kept going deeper into this unfunny, tasteless humor.

 I've learned that saying "I'm sorry," isn't the best thing.  Reiterating an empathetic apology doesn't make anything better.   




 Idiocracy.  Maybe I wasn't giving it my full attention, but I saw nothing even slightly entertaining about that movie.  People talk about it like it's an obscure gem.

 I love how he thinks a banana is the perfect example of intelligent design.  When it's an even better example for evolution.  We haven't always had them,  they evolved.  They used to be inedible when raw.

 Religions are also no longer needed in todays society, if you need a book wrote thousands of years ago that contradicts itself hundreds of times and has had it's fundamentals proved wrong to live a good life then you have moral issues. Every human nowadays has the capability to be sensible and morally correct to their own judgement, why use something else that just causes problems?


Well put!
 




 I completely agree with how you describe your view.  Perfect.  

It's important to me because I feel like humanity has a lot of living to do.  I feel as if people are too busy worrying about how they will spend their afterlife than to really enjoy this life.  

It comes down to... NONE of us know what will happen after we die.  Nobody.   No one has that knowledge.  And instead of worrying about it, we should just live.  

I guess my viewpoint isn't geared towards fence-riders, more towards fundamentalists.  The people that waste their lives, or harm others, or stand in the way of other people's rights.

 I agree the statement sounds negative, but what do you worship?  




 Sorry!  I had to reread the conversation.   




 You have no idea what you're talking about.  They are not labeled fundamentalists because of one individual collecting donations or running a shelter.

"Before the passing of the Homosexual Law Reform Act 1986 by the New Zealand Parliament, the Salvation Army was active throughout New Zealand gathering signatures for a petition seeking to prevent the bill's passing."  

They lobby against equal rights. 

That was pulled right from the page OP directed you to.

 "Christian theology condemns blasphemy. It is spoken of in Mark 3:29, where blaspheming the Holy Spirit is spoken of as unforgivablethe eternal sin." [Wiki]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blasphemy)

That's just what I was going off of. 




 It feels the most complimentary when its dark. 




 Suicide is a sin, but I thought the only *unforgivable* sin was blasphemy?   




 Shorter would work, too.  You really just have the best texture and density for the style you're rockin now, though.
