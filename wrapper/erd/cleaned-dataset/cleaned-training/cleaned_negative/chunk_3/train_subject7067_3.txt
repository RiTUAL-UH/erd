 This story is some levels of fucked up. 




 stfu. 




 hottest pic i could find of kraft's lady was THIS pic unfortunately.  she's fine as fuck in this one. 




 it's fine stfu 




 blink distance soooo hard. talk about learn it once and never again.  BIG WHOOP.  cry a river, every fucking casual knows this shit.   git gud. 




 I can't believe this filthy casual nonsense is getting upvoted.  At this point in the game, no I don't think it was arbitrary.  I once thought randomly having skill shot blink was arbitrary, but it turned out to be meaningful even if very tiny bit.  Then I thought it was arbitrary cause the distance thresholds chosen, but at this point he probably tested the distance out a tad.  You need some more experience in the game or stop spouting this trash nonsense.  Same kind of bullshit that supporters of comeback mechanics in 6.82-6.83.  Stop forcing everyone to play your version of nerfball.  We don't give a shit, and it hardly affects your trash level of play. 




 Why the fuck is this getting downvoted.  Why do these casuals think this is a punishment/penalty when it's a reward for paying attention/effort.  If you're lazy and you don't give a crap it hardly affects you anyway, even if the opposing mate landed 90% of his blinks in optimal 1150+, it still wouldn't fucking matter.  What is the big deal about allowing there to be room for a bonus given you want to get that bonus blink distance. 




 Lol, you should prepare to be downvoted in a thread like this, not OP.  Top comment thinks blink is totally arbitrary, and the 960 unit blink is a PENALTY.  Wrong 1200 is the reward, git gud, or just casually blink at 960 like I do because i'm fucking lazy.  But why ruin it for those that want to do things properly/optimally and not like a lazy shit like me?  These threads are filled with casual shitheads.
