 Plasti dip holds up awesome!  check out www.dipyourcar.com  to find out more.    Basically it let's you paint your car for the fraction of an actual paint job.    You can also peel it off if you get sick of it and go back to OP. 




 Hey my sister made that! I posted this awhile ago!    




 Im just throwing this in here.   Started youtubing spiders and I just want everyone to listen to this one walk across the floor.

Edit:  so many replies.  I'm trying to forget I posted this video.   




 Fun fact: Bruce is named after the villainous Great White Shark from Jaws. In said film, the shark has no given name, but the shark models used in the film were all named "Bruce", hence Bruce's name. 




 Reminds me of a Doom cut scene.  




 Can you eat cereal out of your chest?  




 All I see is the Dorito bag logo  




 I honestly think he is upset about the whole Sim City debacle.   




 The best part is when the paparazzi start getting filmed they flip out.   




 Now look, she wants the Heki 2 roof lights, uh, the stylish ash frame furniture, and the scatter cushions with, uh, matching shag pile cover. Yeah. Right. And she's terrible partial to the periwinkle blue boss.

 Nope. It's his second cousin, Cpt Jack Swallow.  




 Ya,  what do u mean?? 




 What are you talking about? 




 I know.  Anyway still cool. 




 It's not bankys.   This happens everytime!    




 Bankys is so creative! 




 But cake and dinosaurs, right buddy?  




 Same.  There's no way the dog put that scrabble game on it's head.

 Hey Listen:  *I scratched your paint!* 




 I won $4 on the powerball!  




 Who are you to talk?   I was actually part of that accident and I died.    




 Do they just print off their default on imdb? 









 This gets posted a lot, but if you haven't seen the video I would say watch it.   




 That's awesome.   Have a good night!  




 I'm going to tail off your comment if you don't mind.  

I see you are wearing a DEI jacket.    Are you an installer?   Or do you work for them.   If so, are you in Canada or the US?    




 Army worms!    




 Ok I will in northern MN, about 5 years ago I had the same guy I believe spit his whole thing to my manager at our car wash.   He was really good and the product seem to work.   Ended up buying $500 worth of product only for them to fall through on the shipment and spray bottles.   




 This has to be the most quoted movie from our generation.   




 Im surprised the car can even move with all those bricks in the back. 




 The key is fake. OP should be able to tell just by weight.    Although it does look like a generic clon key, the black part would be thicker and the line down the key would be etched more.    




 I also work with a bunch of dicks.  




 Weird, I saw giant tits.

 Introducing.. Badger  




 Takes the life of the innocent.   Priceless.  




 You found me!    




 You have to find me!    









 Really pollen through for this guy.    




 I am not 12, but a lot of kids in this sub reddit are around that demographic.  Just depends on the game genre.    




 Funny to me.   So don't matter now does it.   And no I get a lot of useful info from this place.   If someone makes a joke around a group of friends does everyone inform that person that they are not funny?   I love the gaming subreddit, but it's not like people are posting jaw dropping facts here.  Mostly repost and some fun OC.   




 I like how people call out others for being immature or acting like a 12 year old.    It's a joke, thats all,  and for someone to be calling out someone who is on a site based around inside little immature jokes.   Make no sense.   









 Does MN stand for the state?
 




 Yup I'm already $-120.00 on the gun, but the point is I'm dumb. 




 This one

 Ah man that's a bummer.  Looks like I'll be going back.    




 This looks like Adventure Zone.     If I am correct I can send you a ticket receipt for 6000 tickets.   One night my friends and I were drunk and went to this place and I ended up blowing a bunch of money for these tickets.  I'm a 1000 short from a Sniper Rifle Nerf gun that I was aiming for.   Anyway if this is in fact Adventure Zone.   I will mail you the 6000 tickets.   

If not adventure zone,  I will be going back there to win 1k more tickets to get that gun.   




  Hate to say, but that bath rug might be ruined.  Sorry!  :( 




 Trip the baby, trip the baby, trip the baby...sigh 




 I wouldn't pay $16,00 for that half assed paint job.

 Is the mailman Jim Carey? 




 What do you want to know? 




 Someone needs to eliminate the bottom tummy/belly button and join the top half to his waist line.   




 You know Rendle? 




 Fun fact:  My cousin animated the genie in Aladin plus many more movies including.  Lion King, Osmosis Jones, Iron Giant, 8 crazy nights.   He also worked on a video games and the older spider man movies.   I have original drawings for some of these movies.

 He becomes frightened easily. 









 I dated a girl for 5 years in which time I bought this Tiffany's heart ring.   We broke up she moved an hour away for school.  Fast forward three years I started dating this other who had the exact same ring.    

Turns out her ex bf was friend with my ex's new bf.    My gf went over to their apartment saw the ring on my ex n told her former bf she really liked it.    He bought it for their anniversary.     

TL:DR bought ex a ring new gf has same ring which she got the idea from my ex.    




 Baths can harm or even kill them, so always make sure to give them showers.   




 Scarecrow has balls on his chin. 




 Just pull the good ole Lucius Fox move and bring two cell phones. 




 I was expecting to come into the comments and see a handful of people that dated her.   




 Your dog looks like Ron Perlman.

 I wear girl deodorant.  I also will spray some of my gf perfume on myself because I love the spell of..girls perfume.  Any kind really as long as it smells good and girly.   The smell just gives me energy and uppity.  I'm weird.
