 What happens when he gets to 88 miles per hour? 




 I thought everything on the internet had to be true? 




 Congrats!

I'm going to start studying for my extra shortly 

I hate the wait for the ticket to show up on the FCC ULS, Heh.. :-) 




 Heh, I heard someone on a net the other night with the suffix "HIV"  I would get a vanity in a heartbeat if I had something like that.   
  
  
What callsign did you get? 




 I guess our VEs mail the paperwork in? He said its usually 1 week. *shrug* 




 Just got home from taking my exam(s).. Passed Tech, and General today (only missed 1 question on each! )  
  
Now comes the longest wait.. Waiting for my ticket to show up on the FCC ULS, Heh..  




 So you're saying, there's a universe that I invented pants? 




 The LCD on that Anytone looks really similar to the Yaseu FT-8800R 




 But you remembered your smartphone / tablet / laptop?  
  
PRIORITIES MAN! In this galaxy, you should know where your towel is AT ALL TIMES!! ;-)  
  
 




 Think of how obscured your vision gets when you cross your eyes. Thats only a few degrees "out of whack" if the orb of the eye was removed (but remain attached) your brain would have a very difficult time indeed, making sense of the information coming from both eyes.  
Given enough time, (and keeping a constant angle between the eyes) your brain would eventually "figure out" how to put the disparate information together to re-form a whole binocular picture. People with extremely "Lazy" eyes typically have mostly normal vision, but need a couple weeks to "relearn" to see after corrective surgery.  




 I dont know about the tone sweeps, or echoing "sonar style" tones (Sounds like star trek original series SFX, actually) the pulsing static noise sounds a lot like interference from a cellphone reaching out to a tower.  

  
When you recorded this, were you charging a cellphone? Perhaps somewhere close to a cell dead zone?
