 Well aren't we ever-so magnanimous? 




 I'd just like to point out that she is wearing an Allied Waste jacket.  That is all. 




 It says here to take two tablets and call them in an aeon.

I can't find the other half of the recommended dose.  Fuck.

 Not coming up with a VAG* enough title. 




 I think one of the biggest problems is not coming up with a vague enough title for people, or using an existing trope for titling.

For instance, everyone talked about Scumvag this week because of Scumbag Penis.

Didn't really want to ride their coattails, but it appears I'd have gotten a better response if I DIDN'T write my own material. 




 Y'all are hilarious with that instant downvote thing.

Got any comments?
I'd sure like to straighten these OC posts up for y'all, if you'd actually form an opinion.

 The Drug War works, Law Enforcement just hasn't inhaled yet. 




 I wouldn't even play the Lost and the Damned because it was too obnoxious getting lost in that trashy house and the load time made me want to explore it even less.  If I can button switch to other characters, I might check them out on a whim and get over it more easily.. 




 Watch out now, that's a load-bearing image there. 




 Dude, Crytek.

 Divide by Gyro.  It's yummier than the listed alternatives. 




 It looks like one of those Lego Brick Removers, and judging by the position of the drivers' seat, I don't think my bricks would still be attached once reaching the bottom of the hill. 




 Hey Jackie~~ just thinkin' about Johnnie!  chk chk! 




 How many seeds are in those?  They look pretty lumpy [our back yard variety are sweeter than the store-bought, but they're small and quite round instead of oblong, and have lots of seeds]
