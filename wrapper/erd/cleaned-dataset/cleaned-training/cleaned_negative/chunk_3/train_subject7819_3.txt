 Players don't play for the personal achievements.  

















































 Seriously I would've liked Rondo to stay in Dallas.  



















 Tmobile has a 5gb LTE data plan with 100 minutes, for 30 dollars.  




 Great creation definitely needs to be played during the Survivor Finale/Reunion.  





























 You can set up a three way call with Tmobile and your bank, that should resolve the problem.  




 Yes, pm email.  







































 Mike is always playing, smart. 




 Buy the Zerolemon case from Amazon, not the best color palette, but you won't be disappointed.  




 I bought the Zerolemon from Amazon, don't have to charge my phone for about a day and a half, the majority of the time I get 12-13 onscreen hours.  




 How can I log in with a CAC card? 









 Hey its not the show Big Brother.  




 I can't wait for the jury to roast the final contestants, maybe snakes and rats proportions.  




 Hopefully producers read this comment for next season.  




 ELI5? 




 Here's for hoping.  




 Total let down.  




 He keeps preaching that mantra but haven't seen him practice it, intriguing.  




 Just picture Will flopping down the slide previous episode.  




 He my mind was made up on getting rid of Mike and then BOOM I wanted him to stay against the Blues.  




 In the preview for next episode, someone goes into Dans bag and it's discovered that he has two votes.  




 Wow, what a disappointment, really wanted Dan to make a big move and break up the blues. 









 [Here's how they compare] (http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/04/how-googles-project-fi-pricing-stacks-up-to-the-competition/) 









 We all know how well the VA has helped individuals with all the donations.  




 You can get the free router to mitigate that and increase your households wifi speed. 




 I confirm this, I had that plan located at the bottom of the page, 5gb, I think 100 min cap, but you can use Google Voice, if your out of minutes. Was a great plan, and then I switched to the 2 for $100 on Tmobile. I would seriously spend more if I didn't have unlimited. I think it's a nice gimmick for them to say, you only pay what you use, well that would be a lot of dinero. 









 The prices seem outrageous, they want to charge $10 per GB, when you can stay put with what you have know and have unlimited. I believe T-Mobile is $80 unlimited, come on, not sure what Google Wireless is thinking on this one. 




 Actually, you'd be better off staying put, the prices seem downright outrageous.

 This sounds like it could potentially save a lot of money. Im wondering how these compare to T-Mobile, ATT, and Sprint? 


































 It sounds like a way for the government to ensnare some of those that are not financially savy, but on the other hand that lump sum can help with a down payment on a house or to purchase a vehicle clear and free. 




 Ill jump on the Vote Mike out bandwagon. 




 True, it will depend on what they contribute, and a Mustang seems like a better idea in the short term. 




 Look like the string of 1% will be broken, possibly. 









 Can I stay in Reddit with the ESPN app? 














 On mobile.  




 What about in the thread for those of us not near a television?  




 Is there a way to have the score update automatically at the top of this thread and all of the following game threads?  




 The Jet can't hurt his former team. 




 Let's go Mavs. 




 Or another brief that's not able to show metrics of progression on the force. 
























 I find it hypocritical that the congressman mentioned the changes would not yield much in savings but strengthen the force, if I ever heard such a crock of BS. 




 Thanks 





























 Three belts and a crown at risk, wow, how exciting for the winner and devastating for the loser. 
























 Is this something to be worried about?  What's the consequences of not going through with the match, other than a lot of Benjamins?  



















 Are there any that populate instantaneously?  Feedly often takes hours to update.  




 Feedly populates slow but has a good layout. Is there any that populate faster and not hour later? 














 Laser by chance?  







































 Unless you are in a command where PT is at your discretion.  







































 Does anyone have any openings for training in Antarctica, the training and environment must be nice and it comes with a service medal to boot, granted your there for 15 days.

 Yep, heard that before,  dress right dress. Different culture I suppose.  




 Sometimes humans over think it and it constantly plays out in life and sports, if only I had some examples.  




 I think she'll scale it back, hoping to get some rest in her legs. I think she needs to partner up with Desi Linden and jump in her training plan. 




 Disappointed Hastings dropped out, Sarah Hall though about it too in the LA Marathon but thought better. She said once you DNF once it's always on your mind to do it again.  




 She has no speed. 




 Any idea when this "new" APFT will be phased in? 



















 How does he have time for this? I run 40 miles a week and have no free time. 









 Are they trying to mirror the Good Wife?  




 Wow makes you stop and pause.  




 Today was not their day. 


































 Interesting, thanks.  




 Nice you must get deals on the shoes. 




 Most likely.  




 That's a great honor.  



















 I would like to see what Belichick and Co prioritize to avoid the so called Bubble? In years past they have traded down and that has paid dividends, but with the Patriots getting older, maybe he takes a chance on a high salary player but I doubt it as we have seen with Welker and other players looking for large contracts.  














 I've always wondered? It must be neat to see Rich Eisen, Chris Berman, Lindsay Czarniak running around.  




 Scroll below, it's been a pattern.  




 Cracked up. 




 Wow how'd you get selected straight out of AIT? 









 http://www.runnersworld.com/general-interest/treadmill-half-marathon-world-record-set-at-boston-marathon-expo 




 Good read, sound's like they need to cut back on longer distances and sprinkle in shorter runs. 




 I ran 35 miles this week.

 What's her fan base in comparison?  




 Maybe a hacker could figure it out.

 That's great brands are no longer the sole choice for purchasing shoes, Mebrathon runs in Sketchers. 




 It's kind of a nuisance the high cost but hey their worth it.

 Does anyone have a copy of an ESPN contract, maybe has a morality clause.  




 The company came out and defended her, hoping ESPN/Disney let's her keep her job. 




 Or the media is trying to succeed and protect one of their own. 




 How about a no more makeup.
