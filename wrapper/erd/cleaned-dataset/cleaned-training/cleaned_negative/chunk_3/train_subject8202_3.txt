 I would say Boehner and Netanyahu's behavior to Obama was more reprehensible.  




 You think it should be legal and accepted part of society that businesses can discriminate against black and gay people. So again you would be totally fine living in a society where a doctor/paramedic/hospital could refuse service to a minority (whether that minority be gay, black, brown, non-christian etc.)? You think it should be legal for a landlord to be able to kick out/refuse housing to minorities (private business remember). You think it should be legal for a boss to fire someone just because they are gay, black, muslim, jewish, brown etc? I don't think the "free market" would be able to help these people when they end up homeless, out of a job, penny less, or dead. This "the market will sort it out" idea is total BS. The big banks crashed the economy by giving out bad loans, people still go to them. GM knew its cars had a potentially deadly flaw that led to multiple deaths, they posted huge sales gains last year. BP spilled millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf causing an environmental catastrophe, people still patronize them. Your idea that discrimination should be totally legal and be settled in the marketplace is flawed because the market has shown that people don't care about "ethics" and all of that stuff, all they care about is a great deal. If the company that gives them that great deal happened to kill a few people, discriminate against people, or poison the environment along the way so be it.

 So Alaska, Western and Northern Canada, Greenland, Iceland, all of Ireland, and part of Scotland to reach $1 trillion. That would be an awesome country.  




 I think Ford Field would be great.  




 look at that unbiased source. The difference is that those laws doesn't allow discrimination. The Indiana bill didn't include any measures to prevent discrimination. Also it is plainly obvious that this law was passed as retaliation against gay people for getting marriage equality.  




 and here's you thoughts on gay people. http://np.reddit.com/r/Atlanta/comments/2yv2c6/opinion_is_georgia_turning_its_back_on_tolerance/cpdetg8 




 Bill was signed into law today, goes into affect in July. 

 




 so you admit this was passed to discriminate against gay people?  




 You really think republicans are going to let gay people become a protected class?  




 You can use the exact same arguement for segregation. You think I makes economical sense to discriminate against gay people?  This "the market will sort it out" idea is total BS. The big banks crashed the economy by giving out bad loans, people still go to them. GM knew its cars had a potentially deadly flaw that led to multiple deaths, they posted huge sales gains last year.

 The difference is that Illinois bill doesn't allow discrimination. The Indiana bill didn't include any measures to prevent discrimination.

 Georgia's bill stalled http://thegavoice.com/georgia-religious-freedom-bill-stalls-after-discrimination-amendment-passed/ 




 By that logic then segregation was completely fine and dandy.  




 It stalled http://thegavoice.com/georgia-religious-freedom-bill-stalls-after-discrimination-amendment-passed/ 




 Still defending it I see. 
 




 You have also shown that you don't know anything about the bill. You haven't shown me that it WON'T happen. And no Indiana isn't a terrible place, but because of this bill I will no longer do business there. Have fun while your economy suffers because of this.  




 If I can't find the damn thing how can I make my point. Also I guarantee you haven't read the thing either since the thing is impossible to find online. It's almost like the state of Indiana doesn't want the public to see it. If they didn't want discrimination all Indiana had to do was be like other states and add a provision into the law saying that no one could use this law to discriminate against other people. That fact tell me right there that your politicians don't care about "religious liberty" but are instead a bunch of homophobic bigots. Also the fact that they made this law now after gay marriage became legal says a lot, if this was so important they could have done this 10 years ago when being a bigot was in-vogue. And no one who didn't support this bill would be defending it as hard as you have been on this thread.  




 "And they elected me TWICE" 




 If you don't think the bill is necessary why are you defending it. And I can't even find the damn bill online. Have you actually read the bill? Can you tell me where is says that no one CANNOT discriminate against people?  




 http://www.religionnews.com/2015/03/24/indiana-house-passes-controversial-religious-freedom-bill/ 




 Don't listen to the Bolier guy. He fails to mention that the Indiana bill doesn't have any amendments to protect against discrimination like other laws in other states do.  




 Tell me why this bill is needed.  




 Michele Bachmann isn't in congress anymore. She left last year, and she made is crystal clear it had nothing to do with a federal investigation into financial misconduct during her failed presidential campaign.  




 [The Georgia bill stalled in the house today](http://thegavoice.com/georgia-religious-freedom-bill-stalls-after-discrimination-amendment-passed/). That's right folks Georgia is more progressive than Indiana.  




 Yes it is the intent. Why introduce this now when gay marriage is legal. I have not seen a single argument for this bill. And that is exactly what the bill is about. Discriminating against gay people.  




 That is exactly what the bill is saying. A store can refuse service to you if you are gay.  




 But do they specifically target gay people like the Indiana bill  




 Oh look. Christians passed yet another "Christians may discriminate against everyone, but nobody may discriminate against Christians" law.

Well, what a surprise. 




 Good.

 You can say the same thing about Fahrenheit.  Under 32 is damn cold. Freezing is 32, 40 is cold, 50 is chilly. 60 is cool, 70 is perfect weather, 80 is mild, 90 and above is hot. It is just like Celsius expect units of 10 instead of 5 - simple. 

(Not saying that either is perfect or that one is better than the other, just that the same logic of Celsius can be applied to Fahrenheit)

 That is one thing. What Isreal did though was take the information that they got and then gave it to GOP members in congress so that they could sabotage the deal. That is why this is news and probably why Obama doesn't like Bibi so much (among other reasons)  




 There is nothing stoping Cobb or Gwinnett from entering MARTA and "differences " between the counties can easily be resolved. CCT and GCT are just bus service. Its easy for MARTA to come in and simply  replace it. Public transportation is universal, there is nothing that makes it special. It's bus and rail, that's it. CCT and GCT are not special. Funding might be a little different but again nothing stoping Cobb and Gwinnett from joining MARTA. Also the best public transportation systems are large ones that serve the whole region, not a peace meal of regional ones. Looks at the systems in San Francisco, Botson, and Washington dc. They work because they are one system where everyone contributes and everyone benefits.  




 I'll answer your question with a question. What is wrong with MARTA?  




 If you have no problem with the state subsidizing public transportation in Cobb and Gwinnett county but have a problem with the small possibility that Fulton and Dekalb county are subsidizing public transportation in Clayton then you have your priorities out of line. Also there is no legitament reason for Cobb   Gwinnett to reject MARTA. MARTA works just fine, Cobb and Gwinnett don't deserve special treatment and should join MARTA so that we can finally have a universal public transportation system  




 Look at his comment history. It's full of "libtard" and "demtard" comments. If you expect a rational discussion from him you are wrong.

 [Netflix decided not to bit for the rights to Seinfeld after spending $118 million for the rights to Friends](http://www.mediaite.com/tv/amazon-hulu-yahoo-compete-for-seinfeld-reruns-after-netflix-passes/).

 You are failing to recognize that C-Tran was shut down during the worst of the recision when the economy was literally in free fall and governments were slashing everything. With an improved economy there is a chance that Clayton County will be able to contribute enough revenue to MARTA in order to make the whole thing worth while. But regardless I highly doubt that Fulton and Dekalb contribute an equal amount to MARTA funding. If Fulton contributed more than Dekalb you could make the argument that Fulton is subsidizing Dekalb (or vise versa if Dekalb contributed more) so I still don't see what your argument is 




 people who act on their conscious shouldn't be discriminated against 

those gays however, fuck 'em.  




   what this path we are walking down leads to

What path are we leading down to? Nothing has changed. Capitalism is doing great. Stock market is at an all time high and companies are posting record profits.  




 I didn't say you preached hate. I said that I HATE people LIKE YOU - ONE ISSUE VOTERS. In that YOU put GUNS BEFORE PEOPLE. You said you support gay rights, I'm gay and I'm glad you do. HOWEVER the fact that you think guns are more important than me being able to marry the person I love, being able to go to a business and not be turned away because I'm gay, or not being able to be fired just because I'm gay. I support Democrats for more than just their stance on gay rights. You said you vote for the GOP just because of guns. You seem to put guns before people and that is what I don't get. I never said I hated you, I never said that you preached hate, I said (maybe poorly) that your values are misplaced and I didn't like your values.  




 Last one then I'm done. The reason that I HATE people like you is that you chose something as stupid and unnecessary as a gun over the rights of your fellow humans. [This is what republicans are for](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/19/james-lankford-chipotle_n_6904070.html?utm_hp_ref=gay-voices ir=Gay%20Voices). Again the fact you chose guns over people is something that I can't understand.  




 You and I both know that I'm not going to convince you of anything, so I'm just going to tell you what I think about you, the NRA, the gun lobby, and the pro-gun nuts of this country 




 More guns doesn't stop tragedies, having no guns period stops tragedies. It is people like you that keep electing the GOP to power. Because we have people like you electing the GOP to power we have federal student aid being slashed, food stamps being slashed, women's rights being reduced, gays reduced to second class citizens, and our healthcare under constant threat from being gutted. All because rednecks like got to have guns to compensate for the fact that they are weak pathetic human beings who don't feel complete unless they have a  gun to shoot at people who piss them off. You people are sick. I hope you are happy with yourself that you are ruining this country.  




 I was under the impression that C-Tran failed because the county couldn't afford it once the economy crashed. But I could be wrong.  




 Right because a pistol will do a lot to stop a semi-automatic. I firmly believe that had the amount of ammo in the magazines been restricted, or better yet the gun not be allowed to be sold, that the loss of life would have been a lot lower.  




 Considering that you live in CT makes it even worse that you believe that considering what happened at Newtown. Also are you saying that we use guns to stop people from taking away abortion and gay rights? If so then 1. that is absolutely fucking insane 2. you should start a rampage immediately because all the republicans have been trying to do for the past 3 years is take away gay and abortion rights - put your money where your mouth is.  




 That makes absolutely no sense at all. The Democratic party is not coming to take your guns. All they want AT MOST it universal background checks and to stop the sale of  of semi-automatic weapons (some don't even want to stop their sale but set a limit on the amount of ammo in the magazine to a respectable number like 15 or 20) . It is good to know that you value inanimate object like guns over the rights of women, poor people, and gays.  




 While part of me is like you and is ecstatic at this news another part of me fears he'll actually be elected and become the new Reagan. 
 




 Yes they know. It's kinda hard to miss the camera on the dashboard. I don't know about training but I do know that usually the stuff recorded is stored in a container in the trunk and that only a supervisor can open the case so that the officer can't tamper with it.   




 As a person from Georgia it's one of the following 

1. because they are racists 

2. Because they believe that this is "southern pride" that this is a part of their history and that this history should be celebrated. 

3. They are stupid bros who think it looks cool and want to be rebels.

 NBC/Comcast have nothing to do with the Seinfeld library. Sony has total control over that.  




 I have a few of the season on DVD and while Seinfeld is a hilarious show I don't think if lends itself to binge watching. When you watch the episodes back to back you realize just how ludicrous the show is and how unlikeable/ridiculous the characters are. Many would say "that's the brilliance/joke/point of the show". While this is true I honestly believe that it's best in small doses, otherwise it gets tiring.  




 When you grow up with something it becomes second nature. I know that freezing is 32, I know that 40 is cold, 50 is chilly. 60 is cool, 70 is perfect weather, 80 is mild, 90 and above is hot. Oh looky there round numbers.

 why its bad 

It allows people to use their religion to challenge or opt out of various laws - including local laws in Atlanta and other cities - that protect LGBT people and other minorities from discrimination in employment, housing, and public accommodations. In practical terms, S.B. 129 could allow businesses to refuse service to same-sex couples, a paramedic to refuse to provide life-saving services to an LGBT person, or a school counselor to refuse services to an LGBT teenager. The bill puts minority groups at risk of being denied service everywhere from the convenience store to the doctors office.

 http://www.legis.ga.gov/legislation/en-US/Display/20152016/SB/129 




 You don't think it's good, but you think it should be legal and accepted part of society. So again you would be totally fine living in a society where a doctor/paramedic/hospital could refuse service to a minority (whether that minority be gay, black, brown, non-christian etc.)? You think it should be legal for a landlord to be able to kick out/refuse housing to minorities (private business remember). You think it should be legal for a boss to fire someone just because they are gay, black, muslim, jewish, brown etc? I don't think the "free market" would be able to help these people when they end up homeless, out of a job, penny less, or dead. This "the market will sort it out" idea is total BS. The big banks crashed the economy by giving out bad loans, people still go to them. GM knew its cars had a potentially deadly flaw that led to multiple deaths, they posted huge sales gains last year. BP spilled millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf causing an environmental catastrophe, people still patronize them.  Your idea that discrimination should be totally legal and be settled in the marketplace is flawed because the market has shown that people don't care about "ethics" and all of that stuff, all they care about is a great deal. If the company that gives them that great deal happened to kill a few people or poison the environment along the way so be it.  




 By that logic then segregation was fine and dandy (for the people who hated Blacks)

There's probably a bunch of schools that I forgot. It also might depend on if you want to root for a powerhouse school, like Michigan, or want to root for a smaller school, like Toledo, and like some other people said you don't have to choose now. Wait until the season starts and if a team catches your eye you can start rooting for them.  




 Let me start out by saying I'm and atheist and hate organized religion. That may add some biased to me when it comes to certain religion affiliated schools (though schools with loose affiliations like TCU and Wake Forest I have less problems with). Let me also state that this hatred of religion comes from me being gay and all churches rejection of me as a human being. 

BU's policy on gays is absolutely stupid. The fact that the ban on gays and gay sex is still in place in 2015 is deplorable. Kids at college age should not be told by their church, much less their school, that they are not welcome on this earth because of the way that they were born. [Brittney Griner's criticism is pretty good at explaining this](http://deadspin.com/brittney-griner-says-baylor-wasnt-a-good-place-to-be-ga-1563484030).  (Also Fox News is not moderately crazy, they are bat shit insane. )

That is my viewpoint about Baylor and the Baptist Church. It might not seem like an unbiased opinion but it's my opinion. As long as Baylor is tied to the Baptist Church I will continue to view it in this light.  




 It needs to be all of them.  




 I'm sorry but I have reason to fear Scott Walker as a presidential candidate. This is a man who how been reelected twice (if you count the recall effort) despite how unpopular he is. He knows how to run a campaign and lets face facts the moment that Hillary starts running all the anti-Clintion stuff will come out of the woodwork (she isn't the best canidate in the world, just least bad.  




 Along with his buddy Thomas.  




 Baylor is still pretty out there in terms of religious craziness, I wouldn't call aiming to be like Baylor an improvement  




 I don't give two shits about the color of this fucking ugly dress. Though I will tip my hat to the genius how posted this first and is probably laughing their ass off.

 It's my last semester here at Berry, graduating in May. What year are you?  




 I don't even bother reading YouTube comments anymore.  




 Nothing says heterosexual like a bunch of men cutting a wedding cake together. 




 Nothing says straight like a bunch of men cutting a wedding cake together.  




 They can go choke on a bag of dicks, fuck Verizon. They are the ones who started this. If they hadn't sued this wouldn't have happened.  




 Australia would like a word with you 




 Most of these were taken today (first two were yesterday) at Berry College so this is it already in the melting stage. There was a lot more last night.   




 but then they would't have "One True Champion" ^^TM 




 The NCAA doesn't deserve one ounce of sympathy.  




 this thing has been making the rounds on multiple subreddits. I was in Louisiana last I saw  




 You mean Verizon's lawyers. They're the ones that sued the last time 




 I really like listening to Disney songs in other languages.  




 It's unfair to other people.  




 Ah yes, [Gaston](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuJTqmpBnI0) 




  damn now I need to watch this (been years).  




 There are so many good ones to choose from. I started out with just simple categories then through finding the clips I found Colors of the Wind and A Whole new world and I was like "dammit I forgot those".  I could probably list a few more but I think I'll stop.  




 I know. It wasn't among my favorites as a child but now that I'm older I can see the larger picture of the movie.  




  Forgot about these two

 I'm not saying that Sweden doesn't have trucks, It's just surprising that a company like Dodge sells them there. Dodge isn't exactly a global name like Ford or Chevrolet  




 that was sad as fuck  




 TIL they have Dodge Ram trucks in Sweden.  




 god even the birds in Australia are trying to kill people  




 You know there is going to be some comments about a Mexican winning and not a patriotic film like American Sniper  




 good closing speech

 Yes I do, but this wasn't filmed on a 2006 cell phone it was filmed in a potato  




 was this filmed on a potato? 




 Yeah it can get a little hot in the summer time, but I'm used to it. I prefer the blistering heat of the summer to the cold we've been having over the past few days .  




 if that's the case then the map is 100% correct and I retract my earlier comment (i was going off of the op's title)  




 I didn't realize that Texas and Florida were colonies in 1916 /s

EDIT: I made a mistake. I was going off of the op's title. Once it was explained to me I can say that the map is 100% accurate and that I retract the above comment.  




 how do you like it in Atlanta?  




 not surprising at all that this was the case, they pulled the same shit in Houston  




 it appears that this is only a Louisiana problem, the same shit happened last year 




 How did you end up in Atlanta?  




 a small victory  




 one small victory  




 You mean Dish beat Directv in getting something? Are we in the matrix?  




 Excuse my language but FUCK THAT BITCH!!! You're a fucking doctor your not supposed to choose who you treat. The worse thing is that the GOP wants to make this discrimination legal everywhere, they fucking want this stuff. Religious freedom my ass.  




 If it was Atlanta you would be stranded for days  




 Just like they considered it 4 years ago when they gave them plea deals  




 the temper tantrum continues  




 No it is not Roy Moore, the temper tantrum continues
