 I know you can give and turn off certain things your moderators are allowed to do. Here are the categories of choices I have:

* access

* config

* flair

* mail

* posts

* wiki

Will turning off one of these prevent them from banning people? And whichever one it is, will it prevent fro doing other things as well? I only want to them to not be able to ban. 









 My 92 year old mom became very ill a few months ago. She did not eat for a month and didn't even recognize me much of the time. My family and I had pretty much figured it was only a matter of time. 

Figuring it was her last Christmas, I asked you all to card bomb her:




* http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsofCards/comments/2p172o/request_may_i_ask_a_huge_favor_from_everyone/

You did not disappoint. Slowly I saw improvement in her as I brought new cards in every time I visited. She loved them. She showed them off to others. Soon she began reading them herself. I saw the mom I once had, slowly regaining strength, eating, carrying on a conversation and she finally stopped calling me Pete (my name is Wayne).

But the incredible thing I saw today is she walked about six feet. It may not sound like much, but for me it is a miraculous. 

I know I asked you all just to make one last Christmas special for a very special lady. But you may have actually given her another Christmas as well.  You have provided her a will to live and to reason to fight. I wish I could send you all a personal thank you but there were just too many cards. But know together you did something I had given up on. 

Thank you all and may you actually get the opportunity to send more cards next Christmas. :D

P.S. Whoever sent the dancing polar bear card and the snowman with the shaking butt card, you really have provided more laughter and happiness than you could have ever expected. She still shows them to me when I visit.

 I run /r/Assistance    and you guys have helped us sooooo much. Yes_it_is_weird has really done some great work for us. I know he is busy so I didn't want to bug him again.

People request help in our subreddit and we want our subscribers to be aware of when a request is being made by a new user so they can use extra caution.

So we are looking for a bot the reads the age of the OP's account and gives it a special flair if it is a newer account. We would of course want that flair to disappear after a certain amount of time. 

Is this a possibility and is there anyone that might help us implement this?
 




 Still looking for more pics - We just love them here. :D 




 It been a great year thanks to the many awesome people here. Thank you for all your kindness and letting us be a part of your community. :D

*"rabbit, rabbit, rabbit!"* 




 This is our number rule. Please abide by it. 




 My mom was barely conscious when I asked for cards to be sent to her. You guys sent over 250 cards to her and she responded in an awesome way. She can carry on a conversation and she is eating again. There is actually hope now. She is still very weak but she is now talking and even reading your cards. Words can not express my gratitude.

Thank soooooooooooooooooooooo much everyone.

 **Please congratulate r/hubey** - Todays Moderator of the day. Hubey has been away this last week or so, on a long grueling road trip; and not a fun one. But she is racing back trying to get home before Christmas.  She helped out tremendously in the early going and deserves some accolades for her fine work.

And  in case you are out there listening to us  hubey, we selected a special holiday song, just for you:

 We have saved the best for last. Please congratulate the beloved SUEOLSEN  Todays Moderator of the day. Sue is my rock and has a heart of gold. She is the main reason I have not killed anyone this year. I would be so lost without her.

So please give her all the love you can. It still wont be as much as she deserves but try anyway. 

**WE LOVE YOU SUE!!!**

 It's for a great person that doesn't need anything material. But something to show you care a whole bunch. It would be more symbolic than material. All I have is an email address. 





























 **Dudicles** is a special one indeed and has been one of the most versatile and best additions to our staff. I just love this guy. He has not only made my job much easier but has made SantasLittleHelpers a much better place. All with an attitude that makes puppy dogs sing. Christmas around here will never be the same without him.

Please put your hands together and send your love to  the **DUDMAN!**

Someone told of a real bargain at Thanksgiving but I just can't seem to find that post. It's for some needy families so it doesn't have to be fancy. Just good.



Any suggestions? 














 When it's all over come and join us as we celebrate the happiest place on Reddit. This year we have brought Christmas to hundreds and hundreds of people around the world and had fun doing it. Proving that helping people is not only doable, but is actually fun. 

Share your pictures with us, tell your stories of your crazy uncles, tell your best jokes, maybe a contest or two, picking a new song for our 2014 video, and don't forget we are giving away a 32" Color TV to one lucky giver. 

See you there. :D

 









 Congratulations to Baes  Todays Moderator of the Day!

 Deleting requests is a bannable offense. 

Sorry to sound harsh. We have just had a rash of this tactic being used lately. We try to be nice and give out warnings. We do not like to be dicks. But there are a few who are abusing that.

If there is a special reason you want it removed, contact the mods and they will do it for you. Then there is no suspicion or no problem. 

Sorry to sound like a hothead. We just don't want any of your generosity to be taken advantage of.  









 This is a real special moderator of the day. /u/Fwogzilla has done such awesome work and has helped so may. This guy is a hero among heroes.

 I'm facing all sorts of adversity right now. Whether it is health, being able to afford to live, being able to work, and just being able to live for another day. It is all happening at once. Without a family to run to and without any remote friends that can lend a hand in the way I need, I am facing extreme calamity. Possibly death.


Everything that I'm going through is because of a mystery illness that I was faced with a couple years ago. It's gone to far to the extent where I really need help, especially since a recent accident that happened a couple months ago. I can't walk. If I must, I have to wear leg braces. I can't walk because of my arthritic and ligament problems, which was caused by the illness that spread throughout my entire body to cause all of these things. It doesn't help that I was training and working out a lot during my time in the Marine Corps. It's caused me constant bleeding throughout these past couple of years. Lately, and for the first time this year I have lost feeling in both of my feet and legs. It's starting to spread upwards on my leg. I've fainted numerous of times just from being too sick. I've found myself passed out in the bathroom floor or in the hallway. I've fainted in the hands of professions in the hospital, as well. I've had to deal with tons of research done to me. Seen tons of medical professionals. None have been able to really help me or conclude what possibly happened to me. I haven't gave up despite all of my problems.


I'm ultimately needing 20K for treatments. I'm living in an apartment without any bed (I've been sleeping on the floor) and my tent has been due ($1,445 for November and December). I'm about to get an eviction notice. My apartment complex wants to kill me. It is winter time. I'm on my last $30. To say that I just need $20K for treatments wouldn't be enough. My treatments can take 1 and half to 2 months total. This is from a doctor that I know can make me better. I'm really ashamed and feel like I'm asking for too much already. But, I already exhausted all the possible resources I can and whatever anyone can give me as advice. I can immediately start working after this and finish my schooling. 

* www.gofundme.com/gilvx4


I'm the review of what I ultimately ask, please consider my statements hereforth.

Does someone chose to get sick? Or is it someone else's fault to get sick? I have been blamed for both. I feel at fault and at my wits end. I feel like I have asked from the VA (Veterans Affairs), to the government, to my friends (and "friends") and to my connections to no avail. I am at your full mercy to pick me up. To give me a chance, again. Not to run and to sloth at this given opportunity, but given a chance to make a difference. A difference that I know I can do and promise. To give back.

If you need any proof, questions, or concerns, please let me know.

 Backpackwayne's mom has really gone down hill in the last couple months. I have had to face reality and accept that I will lose my mother soon.




The last couple months I've watched my mom, who is the epitome of kindness, waste away to what look to be her final days. She didn't eat anything for the last month.



But this last week I bought a new TV for her hospital room just to give her some kind of stimulus. I never dreamed it would spark her will to live like it did. She has started to eat again and can once again carry on a limited conversation.

Well I thought if something like a TV could do that much good, Just think what would happen if we flooded her with hundreds of cards from arounf the world. Even if it didn't have that effect, it would be wonderful that in her final days she knew  that the world was still thinking of her.

**Please, everyone send her a card.**

She likes cards with cute babies and kids and loves the funny stuff too. She is no prude. So feel free to send risque stuff too. Just make her smile.

If there was ever something you could do for me, this would it. I want my mom's final days to as happy as I can make them.

Please PM for the address.

Thank you everyone 

And spread the word elsewhere if you can. I want to shower her with all the cards and love I can.


-------------------

Thank you everyone. Over 250 cards and it has really brightened up my mom. She is actually carrying on a conversation. She just loves it. Words can not express my appreciation. Bless you everyone.

Well I thought if something like a TV could do that much good, Just think what would happen if we flooded her with hundreds of cards from arounf the world. Even if it didn't have that effect, it would be wonderful that in her final days she knew  that the world was still thinking of her.

**Please, everyone send her a card.**

She likes cards with cute babies and kids and loves the funny stuff too. She is no prude. So feel free to send risque stuff too. Just make her smile.

If there was ever something you could do for me, this would it. I want my mom's final days to as happy as I can make them.

Please PM for the address.

Thank you everyone 

And spread the word elsewhere if you can. I want to shower her with all the cards and love I can.
 









 Backpackwayne's mom has really gone down hill in the last couple months. I have had to face reality and accept that I will lose my mother soon.

**Good Luck!**

 









 /r/SantasLittleHelpers grants Christmas wishes to redditors around the world. We are a little short on givers right now. To attract them I bought an **Emerson 32"  TV** to give away in a raffle. Every gift someone gives, they get a ticket for the raffle.

----------------


We really need to spread the word about this.

**I'm asking if any of you would allow me to make a post in your subreddit.**

Here is the post:

Thank you so much,

 If you have been following the story, Pegoeg182 daughter Bailey has been in and out of the hospital with pneumonia. She has been there all day today with her and told me she could use a laugh.

Well let's all see what we can do. Post the funniest stuff you got.  



















 **/u/Automateallthethings**  is SantasLittleHelpers **Moderator of the Day!**


Please join me in thanking him for all his incredibly awesome work. He designed and developed this entire page. He is the reason we not only are festive, but look it as well.

Here is the a picture we took of him at our last company picnic

 Many of you know our sister sub only open during the Christmas season:

/r/SantasLittleHelpers 


We bring Christmas to children of **ALL** ages. We have daily contests for everyone, we share recipes, tell jokes and share stories. And most important, we bring Christmas to hundreds of families that would normally not have one. 

And now we are having our biggest contest yet, open only to the givers of the subreddit in our first annual Givers Appreciation Sweepstakes.

* **[Here is how you can win a 32" color TV and help a deserving family at the same time]
(http://www.reddit.com/r/SantasLittleHelpers/comments/2o4dp7/announcing_santaslittlehelpers_giver_appreciation/)**

Please come over and give a small gift to any of these families. 

**We are short on Santas this year. We really need your help.**

***PLEASE SPREAD THE WORD!!!***
 














 The folks here that give make the success of this subreddit possible, so we have designed a sweepstakes exclusively for them. For every gift given, you are automatically entered in the sweepstakes. You must report the gift here:

* https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1NAmMSMtNtmc8S1e6MYF3CjNTHYWPFnCAg9XZXL4zCGM/viewform

**GRAND PRIZE IS:**

**[32" Emerson LED Flat Screen Color TV](http://www.amazon.com/Emerson-720p-60Hz-HDTV-LF320EM4/dp/B00FFJ33N2)**

We hope to be adding additional prizes as well. 

* If you have  reported a gift you have given, you are already entered. Every time you give, you get an additional raffle ticket. 

We just feel that you too should share in the fun for all you do. After all, it is your kindness and generous nature, that makes this sub what it is.

* For those of you new to our wonderful community, just go to any of the **blue shaded posts** and you will find people that need your help this Christmas. Pick an item off their wish list and help make someone's Christmas what it was meant to be. Or make an offer of a gift. Then report the gift to the link above each time and you will be eligible to win.


And please spread the word. We have lots of people who need help this Christmas. A simple toy  toy can make the difference. :D

**Thank You all and best wishes for great holiday season. :D** 
























 Making a request here that leads to another subredit is not allowed.

Mainly what we are saying is you can not make a **request** post here and have it lead over RandomActsOfChristmas. Your can make separate posts in both subreddits. Thanks for your cooperation. 







































 We have lots of contests going on here at SantasLittleHelpers and will be adding more ever day. There is a button on the sidebar that lists them so you be sure to enter them all. 

Good Luck. :D

 With all the excitement going on, I have forgotten to welcome  new members to our staff. You have already seen some of them in action and can't help to falling in love with these awesome people.

We am thrilled and extremely fortunate to have them all aboard.  



















 I bought this Fruit Bouquet Cutter set for someone here and it was delivered to my house by mistake. I can't seem to find out who it was supposed to go to. 

Please tell me if this was on your wishlist so I can get it to you.


http://www.amazon.com/MSC-Flower-Power-Cutter-28444/dp/B00CPNUY7Y/ref=sr_1_22?ie=UTF8 qid=1416966275 sr=8-22 keywords=fruit+bouquet


----------------------------

**Edit:** My Mistake!!! CutieJudy had sent them to me as a present. It all makes sense now because she knows what a fruit I am. 





























 We ask you  to report all gifts given with an approximate value and to who it was given. This helps us make sure no one is being taken advantage of and identifies the folks not getting help.

You can report them anonymously if you like. And you don't have to be all that specific. Mainly who it was given to and an approximate value.

Report the gifts here:

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1NAmMSMtNtmc8S1e6MYF3CjNTHYWPFnCAg9XZXL4zCGM/viewform

The link is also on the sidebar.

Thank you so much for making this community what it is. We could not do it without you. :D

	The mods can assist you and answer your questions though we can not make the decision for you. If you suspect any monkey business, please report it to us, rather than attacking the OP

	Please report your gifts to help us make sure no one is taking advantage. You can remain anonymous if you choose.

 We ask that you add flair to your post to make it easy for others to see what kind of post you have made. It's very simple to do.

Under your post you will see the word **"flair."**


**http://i.imgur.com/cHCLT90.jpg**


Just click that and a menu will drop down. Pick one of the available ones or type one in yourself. Then press **SAVE** 

That's all there is to it. The mods will happily assist you if you have any trouble with it.
