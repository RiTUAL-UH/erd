 If you are going to link to something, then you should link to [the parent comment there](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1d65dr/if_i_fits_i_sits_not_sponsored_by_pringles/c9nfh23).  You know, the one where an admin directly says that guy is full of shit. 

Facts matter.   You knowingly lie to people.   
































































 Ban him again!  




 Thing is, there are a lot of wackos out there selling *cures* for cancer.    It's a common get-rich scheme a lot of very unethical salesmen engage in.   This includes a lot of spammers on the internet too.    

People with cancer are easy targets because they think "if it works, it's worth it".   A lot of people with cancer and other terminal diseases, they're desperate, so a good number throw money at these scam artists.   I wish people would stop preying on cancer patients.    




 I mentioned it earlier and it got up voted.   Somebody else mentioned Nixon so I mentioned it again.   It's a good song.   But I doubt I'll make a giant habit of it.   










































































 With you I don't need to show people four year old screen shots of them being angry.  I just have to show them your [user overview](http://www.reddit.com/user/ExileOnMeanStreet).   It immediately demonstrates to everyone you were banned.    You are not going to be allowed to post any bs racist stormfront copypasta at /r/History or /r/HistoryPorn.   Not now.  Not ever.

 I banned him from four subreddits that don't allow racism of any kind.    Meaning under no circumstances.   Racist stormfront screeds, holocaust denial, homophobia, ethnic and religious hate speech, etc.  are not allowed in those subreddits.    Those subreddits ban people for that every day, and will continue to ban people for it.  

Those subreddits are actively moderated and do not allow racist bullshit.   It's the core what those subreddits are.   If you don't like, then you won't be welcome in those subreddits.

 The opening of the Wikipedia article on [the Holocaust](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust) addresses this issue with this sentence.  

Some historians use a definition of the Holocaust that includes the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to approximately eleven million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany and German-occupied territories.  

 




 Einstein wrote some essays about the Nazis rise to power.   I guess in the late 1920s there were groups that would give series of talks about how Einstein was an evil Jewish scientist who was working to destroy German Science.   Einstein got interested a bit and went to a few of these talks and sat in the back and listen to their crazy rants.   From what I recall, he said they never recognized him.
