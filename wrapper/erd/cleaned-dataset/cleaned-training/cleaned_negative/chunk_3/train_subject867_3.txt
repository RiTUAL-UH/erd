 Amazon. B N really hates Amazon. Every time something bad happens with Amazon (like their recent disputes with book publishers), theres an article pretty much celebrating it on our Insider website. 

Also, there's Book People but it's not a huge competitor since there isn't one very close to our B N location. 




 Damn, I wish I knew. I've never heard of anything like that so I'm guessing not. I would love it if they did, though. I said in a previous answer that books that are required school readings are always the most popular. I'll also add that those horrifying Fifty Shades of Grey books are still really popular and its usually tired moms who come in and buy the whole trilogy. 




 We have a shelf of unreleased books that we can take home. I've read a few of them, honestly they haven't been my favorites. A few days ago someone left their payed copy of Flowers for Algernon at the check out counter and I read it during my shift and it was depressing at shit. 

So far, my best day at work was my first time working at the Customer Services desk because there was no one there who needed help so I pretty much spent the day hanging out with my friend at the children's section. My managers are super chill so they don't care if we just stand around and talk as long as there are no customers looking for help. So yeah, it would either be that day or this other time when it was storming and we were doing inventory so for the last two hours of my shift there were literally no customers so we went around the store taking pictures with the hand puppets.
