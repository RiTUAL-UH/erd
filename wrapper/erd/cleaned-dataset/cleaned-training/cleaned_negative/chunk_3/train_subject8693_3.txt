 I haven't laughed this hard in a long time. Thanks OP. 




 Nah man, he's summoning the planeteers because he needs to speak with Captain Planet about global warming. 




 Horses like bowling too. 




 Even without the beard I have a hard time believing this is a woman. 




 Einstein didn't smoke a pipe. He was known to pick used cigarette butts off the ground whenever he felt the urge for nicotine. He also enjoyed sailing when there wasn't any wind, because he liked the challenge. 




 It amazes me how people like this say their adults and they have the right to say and act how they want, all while living in mommy and daddy's house enjoying the amenities they bought for them. Its like they've got the mind of a five-year old. 




 Is that a slightly younger Angus T. Jones?

 You can beat Dishonored without killing anyone. Hard as hell but it can be done. 




 Wut... 




 Give him a kiss and pets for me. He's adorable. 




 I was on 300mg Luvox for about a year. Didn't notice any help with my thoughts or compulsions. It did cause fairly severe anorgasmia though.

 This too shall pass.

 I'm gonna pistol whip the shit out of you. 




 I'm calling shenanigans on this. 




 Challenge accepted. 




 "I just wonder...is their more to life than eating things off my belly?" 




 Call me anything you want, just don't call me late for dinner. 




 That is the greatest compliment I've ever been given on here. Thank you. 




 Bull fighting. 




 I feel the same way when I see someone taking a selfie. 









 Trichotillomania. 




 Yeah I am, but at least I'm not a milkshake.

 Wait. 




 Social media. 




 This is fucking hilarious. 




 I've been on benzos before and my advice is STAY AWAY. I was on 1mg Klonopin a day, and I ended up with severe side effects. Numbness, difficulty breathing, photophobia, insomnia, hot/cold flashes, I legitimately thought I was going to die. You can experience these side effects even if you do everything your dr. tells you, and they can last for years. I've been off them for about 4 months, and I'm still having problems with numbness in my arms and legs. Unless you think you REALLY need them, stay faaaaar away. 




 *What other people think of you is none of your business.* My therapist told me that and I've found it to be very helpful. 




 Robin never got the credit he deserved. 




 Try b12 vitamins, they'll help put some pep in your step. 5-Hour Energy's work too, just be careful with them. I didn't listen to the instructions on them one stressful day at work and I downed 2 extra strength and 1 regular in a very short period. I had heart palpitations and couldn't bend over without my heart skipping a beat. Which is a serious problem when you cook for a living. 




 B12 vitamin can be helpful. 




 The only serious side-effect I had when I was on SSRI's was anorgasmia. Was hellish given my age and just in general, I really hope its not something you have to deal with.

 People like you are the ones who give hope for the rest of us.

 This is my personal experience, not looking to step on anyone's toes. But I found when I stopped believing in a higher power, started seeing things differently, that it helped me gain some level of control. 









 Michonne's a good looking bitch.

 I wonder what it tastes like? Would..would it be good in soup?

 Sounds good. I'll be able to load the pics tomorrow. I have to take precautions when I handle it, the binding is almost nonexistent. But the pages are beautiful and the illustrations are mind-blowing. 




 I'm in Maryland, U.S.A. Would you be interested in photos of my great-grandfather's bible? Its over 100 years old.
