 My friends and I wore the hell out of that pause button for the "upskirt" scene. It's amazing what the teenage brain thinks it sees. 




 He's officially out now with a concussion. 




 That's what I assumed, but I wanted some reassurance. Good thing I made him throw Bush into the deal as well. 




 Who won this trade?

Alshon/Reggie Bush for Percy Harvin

Thanks! 




 Depends on Charles' injury. If he plays, take a risk on Khiry. If Charles isn't playing then you have to go with Knile. 




 I doubt Charles will play, but just keep monitoring the situation. If he plays, I would go with Smith. 




 1pt PPR
Emmanuel Sanders or Reggie Bush?

The Sanders matchup worries me...
