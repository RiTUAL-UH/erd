 So you get the far superior player and a pick? Good lucking signing Aldridge and Love.  




 Other Suns fans will have different opinions, but I agree with you and I think the front office is fickle.  














 It appears he's on the block and Phoenix will take a half decent offer because they're eager to unload him. What are possible trades and what is the best Phoenix could do?  




 Because I don't have to buy food from the one grocery store you go to. I don't have to chicken with broccoli to live. I can substitute ramen and cans of tuna and live off of that. But if I need a particular procedure, what choice do I have? I think you should reconsider.

We really don't have to reinvent the wheel. We have medicare and we can use that as our base. Just look at every other developed country. There's not that much mystery. Single payer would be better.  




 These are great questions!!! Let's hope we hear them in the debates.  









 oh, this is making me remember stats 




 why? 









 The markets of supermarkets and heatlhcare are very different! If I don't buy Safeway's overpriced  produce, I'm not going to die. I have many other options to buy groceries. I can even grow some food myself. Now, what happens if I need medical care? The inelastic demand curve says I have buy the product no matter how much everyone is going to rip me off. If there was medicare for everyone the government can bring down prices drastically just like every other country does. That is the power of a single provider.  




 [God wills it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ez6wfJWVCeI), Sanders will win! 



















 this is a win for democracy and Americans  




 It never is to get progress. It can be done though. 




 which website is giving those odds? 




 it makes sense 




 exactly 














 Let's not confuse the 2% who are part of organization with those that support it. [42%](http://pnhp.org/blog/2009/04/03/how-many-doctors-support-single-payer/) support it according to one source. With the implementation of the ACA and it's success, those numbers could be even higher if a survey was conducted now. 




 This is a great ruling! It gives power to the people rather than politicians.  



















 Just when we think we're becoming more progressive and humane as  a country, we're reminded that we still execute people. We have a long way to go. 









 Great observations, it definitely would be a huge plus for business. 

[Many doctors](http://www.pnhp.org/) are for single payer FYI. 

Fuck insurance companies. 

Fuck politicians.  




 the merc s class assure me they aren't 




 That's called true love. 




 no, that's not for us, we prefer paying a lot more than you and getting less care and paying a lot more for procedure sand medications cause 'Murica  




 GGG should start talking up Floyd as much as possible like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGIIleYLpRY) 




 they attempt to draw parallels with mainstream sports to imply their product is mainstream too 




 great quality videos! 




 some of us do 



















 Sanders has a 11/1 hance according to vegas. I think you're very optimistic if you think you have a 1 in 11 chance of dating her. 




 Free agents don't want to play for Sarver.  




 she seems like a fun chick unless you're trying to [sleep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDEqaAV5ZSc) 




 A little bit, but not like for profit medicine.  




 He's not repealing the law. He's trying to add something better. 




 Why doesn't he sit out until they pay him? If he's only making 1.5m it seems like it's worth it. 




 Yes for the rich it's the best. For your average American it is not. 




 He **did not** fight for the public option. He gave it up faster than girl on prom night.  




 He is. Let go of conventional thinking. 



















 government actually is more efficient FYI 




 Jesus? Who's that? Never heard of him.  




 Yes, I can see it now. Can we put you out of business? No, you wouldn't like that? You'd prefer to keep charging twice as much as you need to? Ok.  




 I'm sorry. 




 you could maybe get a new job?  









 I think it could show confidence and leadership if one of the republicans declared it. Somebody has to set themselves apart. 




 republicans? lol 




 You  have to at least try even if it's going to fail at first. Obama could have set a bridge for it if he delivered the public option that he promised. 




 Wait, what? doctors can barely make a middle class living? do you know doctors? because all the doctors I have come across and know are making a ton of money

I'm totally for abolishing for profit healthcare and pharm though 




 Jewish carpenter who works for the poor and those in greatest need? Where have I heard that before? 




 Some doctors are greedy pigs. Some doctors actually know how to use medicare to make a lot of money. If everyone was insured they would get care from their PCP instead of waiting to get seriously kill and go to the ER.  




 When there is one giant insurer they set the price. They tell companies what they will pay and they make them compete. It lowers the prices significantly! We have so many other countries that prove this. It's why things costs so much more in America. 

Single payer will reduce costs.  




 If anyone is peacocking, it's Trump or maybe Jindal. Sanders is realizing his goals. 




 You know that medicare currently sets the prices, right?
 




 And the high prices due to inelastic demand is immoral.  




 Did they say it though? 




 Obviously private insurance companies would be **-**, but the money saved from their profits and administrative costs would be a **net gain** for the economy.  




 that's another monster 




 Yes, govt is the insurance company just like they are for medicare and for vets. It doesn't stop you from purchasing anything though. 




 [like this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Health_Care_Act) 









 I can count. You can't be more than 100% sure. If you say anything more it means you're lying.  




 Fisher was a role player. Curry lead his team.  




 he has mad cardio too bruh 




 but the other candidates don't

hillary doesn't 




 considering we pay double to triple what other european countries pay while providing inferior care to those european countries, I think we could use a change 




 that's not nice 




 Whenever someone says they're over 100% sure they're wrong.

 How many titles  does CP3 have? 




 that would be dope! 




 You heard me. He gets along better with his teammates and plays better with them than CP3. 




 Amare his rookie year. Was destroying everyone!  




 [judge his record for yourself](http://www.ontheissues.org/domestic/Bernie_Sanders_Gun_Control.htm)

 




 background checks for sure 









 Curry. Better shooter and better teammate.  




 She won't directly answer the question to not seem like she's taking anything for granted. She'll say something about her supporters and her mission etc etc. 




 Luck you! 




 Yes we do. It shows that his momentum and support is large everywhere he goes.  




 I think they have more empathy but more in touch? That's definitely arguable. Clintons make more in one month than Bernie's net worth. 




 You're  right. For profit is immoral and inefficient.  




 You haven't heard others saying it now, have you? 




 What kind of odds are you giving me? 




 You are not as you are born. You are as you make yourself and as you live your life. Just look at Jindal. 

Same here, I'll support the Democratic nominee. I won't be excited about it though. Hillary is a corporate democrat. 




 Not quite a solid argument there bud. 














 I'll be excited when I see Bernie leading Hillary in a poll. 




 I'm sure he knows this. He's pretty busy. I think you have to be strategic where you go and in what order.  














 You're right, his supporters currently are almost exclusively white. That will change. There is no other candidate that matches up to Bernie in terms of record or policies that support minorities.

 legally though?  




 I think a lot of the west coast and other parts of the country would love to see him in person. 




 It is Hillary's to lose. And there is a lot of time to lose it. 









 I think we need to get [Lenne Hardt to introduce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-wCXgS_dYE) Bernie. Some pyrotechnics wouldn't hurt either.  




 It's still early. We'll see how things start shaping up towards the end of the year. 




 Bernie cares about the environment and he won't sacrifice it to corporate overlords because he's not a puppet like all the republicans and Clinton.  




 His plugs are even worse than Trump's elaborate comb over, but at least he's super tall. It would definitely be a different dynamic if it were a three way race, but I think being the only alternative to Hildawg is working out for Bernie. 




 You're right. He and his campaign realize this though and they're working on it. Plus, early states create momentum.  














 if only i could bet legally on sports and whatnot in my state :/ 

but I can't, not even draftkings 




 People love Bernie too. 




 I saw him 11/1 at another site.  




 You got a time machine bruh? Because if you do, he's 11-1 right now and we can become very rich! 




 McCain had lapses and said questionable things. Sanders is sharp. 




 He's running as a Democrat. If he loses the primary, he's not running as a third party candidate. 




 No he's not :) 

About the same age as John McCain when he ran. And Sanders is healthy and sharp.  




 As an Atheist, no Yoel. I'm not going to go for Jesus. This is a secular country. Keep your religion to yourself.  




 I bet they pull a Jon Jones and delete that tweet.  




 You can thank God and such, but keep the proselytizing to yourself, especially when it is bigoted and not PC. And you can be sure this will blow up beyond MMA. When that happens, you can be sure he's suspended or cut. Whatever action the UFC decides to take, Romero brought that upon his self.  




 Without being political or talking about religion, let's just the Abrahamic religions are not tolerant of homosexuality. This is what happens when proselytizing goes wrong. 




 Will he get suspended or outright cut?  




 what did he say exactly? go for jesus not gay jesus? i couldn't understand him 




 all they need are headlines and soundbites

facts don't matter to the media
