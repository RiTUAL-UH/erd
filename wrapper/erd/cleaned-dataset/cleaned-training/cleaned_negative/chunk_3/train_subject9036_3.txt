 I completely disagree. Not to disregard your post, the creators have gone through much effort to maintain the physics of the world with the exception of bending which remains unexplained. (see: Function and mechanics of hot air balloons, submarines, gravity, properties of ice INCLUDING crystallization now in LoK) which mimics ours.  Air bisons are explained by bending (which remains unexplained but is not related to physics) and hence physics and the properties of every material up until this point are exactly the same as in our world. 

I would like to hear the countless examples which you speak have been different from our physics. So far you only mentioned platinum (which I think is laziness on the part of the new writing team) and air bison flight, which can be explained by airbending which we know is unexplained (or rather spiritually explained). 




 not knowing engineering is no excuse for laziness in preproduction. someone on the writing staff knew something about basic high school chemistry.
