 She would have had to turn you down. It's not ethical. We go through vigorous training in graduate school for counseling just for situations like this.

 There's a leaderboard for people sniped by Maniac? 

I want a go at him. But the last time we tied on time stamp but he got there just a bit faster. The fastest I have been able to compile is 3 seconds and i think I did a normal number at 2 seconds

 Thanks to /u/KingCaspianX for the assist and thanks to /u/TheNitromeFan for handing over for the last 130 or so. Very selfless counters here!!!!  Also, sorry to /u/sparklydude I know you wanted us to slow down :/

 yes. the kitty 




 yes 




 You're hopeless 




 Yes. The higher your vibe the more money you can get for free from the kitty  




 Oh. lol. I'm USA. It says Hawt. Why does it have to say Hawt. ugh. hipsters 




 Do you wanna add me? NNID spkeck805 




 Oh wow it changes to "On-fire"  




 Yeah I found it . it's nice.  




 whats that ? Can you buy it regularly or do you need to do a challenge or something?
 




 Yeah, it's possible she's never worked with special ed kids before and therefore doesn't understand not to put a student in a trash can. 

can confirm: am educator 




 I don't do good with the sniper weapons so I stay away from them. I do like the dynamo roller but its sooo slow lol 




 Yeah the aerospray is nasty. I've only lost two or three times with it in turf wars today. though in ranked, i dont do as well 




 411,038 




 Inkbrush. Yuck. Not a fan. Glad it worked for someone though!  




 I got mine to 14.0 (So Hawt) The Aerospray gun really is awesome for points.

 That's the thing. I didn't know what an amiibo was. I didn't know it was an actual physical toy thing you buy in a box and then scan on your gamepad. I bought this game through wii u virtual so I didn't buy the game physically or anything. So I was unaware you had to physically buy something to complete the 'extra' challenges. 

Edit: why was this down voted?  




 I want hot dog-o


Edit: Bonus points if you know what movie this is from 




 You did yell about that joke. Relevant username. 




 The final boss was hard enough I dunno how I would beat him with a roller lol 




 Wow. I didn't know Splatoon was so popular. I guess Splatoon really helped the Wii U come into prominence again lol.  




 No I just saw people in game with these awesome outfits and stuff and wanted them for myself. So I though..maybe I have to beat single player. So I beat single player and got the sweet aerospray gold weapon which upped my scores in turf war considerably about by 6-700 a round I was getting about 1100 on avg now im getting around 1600 with that thing, and then the Gold Roller

But I want that head that DJ Octavio is wearing and I read online you have to do the amiibo challenges, so I looked how to actually do the challenges but it doesnt say anywhere online. It just says there are challenges so I was confused. 

So I have to buy a physical toy and scan the box.  




 No. I do not. I was unaware you had to do that.  




 Ohhh...so you have to go a store and buy an amiibo? Does Best Buy have them?  




 No I am not joking.  I don't know what you mean by lack of stock joke . I didnt' know you had to actually go out somewhere and buy it in real life.  




 I defeated Hero Mode (single player) on Splatoon for the first time, all 27 levels and the main boss. Now I want to get that samurai hat and I know you get it from one of the challenges, but how do I 'buy' the amiibo inklings to do the challenges? Where do I go?  




 You're fired bud. I'm sorry.  




 The Undertaker isn't random if you see that #2 is "List of WWE Wrestler's"

im gonna go and eat dinner. nice counting with you again.  














 I lost 15 straight at one point. It was just pathetic. I tried everything, but my teammates kept going over to their side to try to kill them when they respawned....which wasn't working so it left me and one other teammate to try and get the splatzone which doesnt work when its 3 on 2 or 3 on 1. 

If you're the type of player that goes over to the enemy side during splatzone please stop. Every time you do we end up losing to the Japanese players and their god damn sniping machines.  




 I feel like this would be harder to produce than regular voice acting.  




 I need some friends. My name is is spkeck805 NNID. And my nickname is "American" ....lol because I play with Japanese all the time I figured I'd let them know I'm not Japanese. haha. 

Will some people add me?  




 Is there a way to be on your friend's team instead of it randomly placing you against your friend or on their team?
