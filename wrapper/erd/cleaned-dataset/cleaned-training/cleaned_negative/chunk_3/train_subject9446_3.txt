 'Their' is referring to the ancestors not the descendants. 'Remember' as in 'commemorate'. One of English's ambiguities.

 Talking about ethics is seen by some as rather old-fashioned, (Note however my use of the word 'highly' in the title of this post), but I would assert that some games are more ethical than others. I also think that a game can be a good game and be bad and a bad game can be good. Make of that what you will.

 Never having played it I'm not able to comment with certainty. Personally,  if I'm being honest with myself, the 'indirect good' I've experienced from playing video games is quite limited indeed. 




 It's a matter of opinion. I'd say the above games are ethical on account of the good that they do over and above passing the time and entertaining.

 Perhaps. There's a big difference between 'putting an end to fracking in its entirety' and not starting it where it has hitherto been illegal, however. 




 Every social society involves some form of agreement to treat your fellow members well

I don't think so. Such an agreement is certainly more explicit in Freemasonry than other groups.

 taking an oath to provide assistance to members of a group makes you incapable of acting rationally

That's not what I'm saying. Partiality and irrationality are not identical terms. 

 if you abuse the public trust, then you aren't acting as a Mason.

So long as that credo is at the forefront of their mind then good on them. When that is ignored society as a whole suffers. 

If it is the case that justice is not perverted through the existence of Freemason cabals, then I retract my insinuations to the contrary. The way things are, however, I will be offering no such retraction. 




 We can't just freeze and starve to death until someone comes up with a hydrogen car and replaces our source of the majority of our electricity. The current demand must be met, or our entire infrastructure would collapse.

You're putting the cart before the horse. If the demand and will for clean energy is there then the economy and energy industry can reorientate accordingly. The German government intends to garner 60% of energy from renewables by 2050. Other nations should follow suit. For the United Kingdom to lift its ban on fracking at this moment in time is a misstep that could have dire consequences both actually and qua gesture politics. 




 It's also the whole 'burning fossil fuels thing'. We should be looking for fewer ways to pollute the atmosphere not more. 




 The Freemason tenets of 'brotherly love' and 'relief' aren't negative in and of themselves but they become so when it enters into a sphere where equality before the law and [the principle of equal opportunities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_opportunity) should remain paramount.

These forms of beauty have not been to me,

But oft, in lonely rooms, and mid the din	

Of towns and cities, I have owed to them,	

In hours of weariness, sensations sweet,	

Felt in the blood, and felt along the heart,	

And passing even into my purer mind	

With tranquil restoration:feelings too	

Of unremembered pleasure; such, perhaps,	

As may have had no trivial influence	

**On that best portion of a good man's life;**

**His little, nameless, unremembered acts**	

**Of kindness and of love.** Nor less, I trust,	

To them I may have owed another gift,	

Of aspect more sublime; that blessed mood,	

In which the burthen of the mystery,	

In which the heavy and the weary weight	

Of all this unintelligible world	

Is lighten'd:that serene and blessed mood,	

In which the affections gently lead us on,	

Until, the breath of this corporeal frame,	

And even the motion of our human blood	

Almost suspended, we are laid asleep	

In body, and become a living soul:	

While with an eye made quiet by the power	

Of harmony, and the deep power of joy,	

We see into the life of things.

 What are some activities that you think are more useful than playing video games? 




 Nope. It was non-fiction. 




 I touch on that in the CMV thread. John Stuart Mill expresses some of my thoughts in chapter two of Utilitarianism - the section containing the famous statement about it being 'better to be Socrates unsatisfied than a pig satisfied'. I also touch on that which makes relationship between the consumer and creator of games different to the creator/consumer relationship in music and movies. In short, games require a greater acquiescence and obeisance from the consumer towards the creator than other media. Additionally, the active participation of the gamer as an agent within the game is a cause of harm. The artificiality creates anomie, through the toxic effect of the necessarily meaningless and unimportant game-world, whereas the mimesis with the real world encourages immorality/immoralism through conditioning (e.g. encouraging violence). 

I also imply, in an aside, that games bring out the bad of competitive sport (brutishness, ruthlessness, and tribalism/egoism, etc. etc. ) with none of the benefits - e.g. exercise.  




 A discussion of my statements, and my (partial) recantation can be found here: http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/26gjxf/cmv_i_believe_that_playing_video_games_is_morally/ 




 I believe that playing video games is a waste of time and a corrupting influence on an otherwise healthy human being. My first objection to video games is founded on the belief that they do nothing good. My second objection is that they do something bad. [edit for /r/philsophy: Moreover, I believe that playing video games is morally indefensible.]

I cannot think of any good that video games do. Where things that resemble video games have a practical implementation they are not called 'video games'. A pilot learning on a flight stimulator has an equivalence to an air traffic controller monitoring a graphic of in-air flights. Neither is playing a game because neither is using a tool that has real-world importance. Whereas a 'video game' is a trivial enterprise, ('game'), in a dimension that doesn't truly exist. The 'video' is just electronic pixels producing an illusion. Existence pertains to that universe that we live in. That of time, space, feeling, and suffering.

The 'unreal world' setting of video games leads to the conditions arising that result in their real-world harm. Whilst I can imagine a game developer with the best intentions trying to create a game which tries to instil good character traits in the 'gamer', I believe her attempt would be fruitless. Any encouragement of positive characteristics would necessarily be concomitant with a diminution and tainting of the 'real world' through association with the 'unreal world'. This leads to apathy and alienation.
Furthermore, if the game developer doesn't approach the project of making a game with the best of intentions then the game will inevitably enforce or reinforce bad character traits. A game that is made with disregard to encouraging moral virtues will lead to a game that encourages immorality (or amorality - as covered above). I believe that this has happened and is happening. It is well illustrated by these comments made by a leading creative

"Hardcore gamers basically love to watch the baby hit the floor. They said I want a game where I can shoot somebody in the head and blow their head off, so the gaming industry moved in that direction. So thats what theyre doing. And you cant empathize with somebody youre going to kill, so that whole idea has gone out the window."

(Games that encourage a ruthless, competitive win-at-all-costs mentality are equally guilty in their ability to clip the 'Angel's wings' that is human potential).


I believe that video games are good for nothing more than as a good example of how to waste time and corrupt. (And that there are better ways to learn such lessons!)

 Is there such a thing as an unwounded soldier? 




 Thus was Mr. Pickwick brought face to face with the difficulty of seeing his own counsel.  He could not understand why, having retained the services of a professional man and paid for them, there should exist any impediment to prevent access to him.  I wont discuss to-night the advisability or non-advisability of dividing the profession of the law into two parts, but I do say that any system which prevents litigants having the fullest personal communication with those they have paid to represent them is an anomaly and an absurdity.

But Mr. Pickwick was a person of determination, and he did see Serjeant Snubbin, and he delivered to that learned gentleman a short address that was well worthy of his attention, as it is of every member of the Bar, including your very humble servant.

Gentlemen of your profession, sir, continued Mr. Pickwick, see the worst side of human nature.  All its disputes, all its ill-will and bad blood, rise up before you.  You know from your experience of juries (I mean no disparagement to you, or them) how much depends upon effect; and you are apt to attribute to others a desire to use, for purposes of deception and self-interest, the very instruments which you, in pure honesty and honour of purpose, and with a laudable desire to do your utmost for your client, know the temper and worth of so well, from constantly employing them yourselves.  I really believe that to this circumstance may be attributed the vulgar but very general notion of your being, as a body, suspicious, distrustful, and overcautious.  Conscious as I am, sir, of the disadvantage of making such a declaration to you, under such circumstances, I have come here, because I wish you distinctly to understand, as my friend Mr. Perker has said, that I am innocent of the falsehood laid to my charge; and although I am very well aware of the inestimable value of your assistance, sir, I must beg to add that, unless you sincerely believe this, I would rather be deprived of the aid of your talents than have the advantage of them.

 [In 1904, Elizabeth "Lizzie" Magie designed a board game to demonstrate the tragic effects of land-grabbing. In this game, oligarchs enrich themselves at the expense of tenants, the latter of whom only grow poorer as available land decreases and the cost of rent increases. Anyone interested in traveling a non-trivial distance has to pony up for a railroad ticket. Anyone desiring light and water had better open their wallet. And crossing the wrong landowner sends a player directly to jail. The poorer the proletarian player gets, the more he or she is squeezed; there is nowhere to go that doesnt demand a fee of some kind, and there is no respite. The game ends only when everyone is driven penniless into the ground, but for a single aristocrat who now owns everything. Lizzie Magie named her grim reflection of life The Landlords Game, but you probably know it better as Monopoly.](http://mentalfloss.com/article/48787/retrobituaries-elizabeth-lizzie-magie-inventor-monopoly)

 Last time I got a BSOD I got a few in quick succession. I deleted recently downloaded software and it went away so I think it was definitely that then.

 It was your tone as much as anything. The Buddha was said to have combined intelligence with love. This is an advanced practise - one requiring speed and deliberation, precision and equanimity, strength and tenderness. It has been said that 'hatred is the near enemy of intelligence'. Can you understand how that might be the case? 




 I have 'delta'd' someone who, to my mind, managed to deserve it. One's man's argument is another's debate. Whilst I was curter than I would have liked to have been as a result of needing to keep up with the oncoming traffic and not neglect anyone (that is until this thread was censored and civilisation's progress impeded in the process), I believe I have helped expose some 'home truths' to those who would otherwise not have heard it through the moans of enablers, nor smelt it through the fetid miasma of their own inertia and self-deceit and have learnt one or two things myself about the brave, unheralded labours of some of my fellow men and women of science who are attempting to redeem video games.
