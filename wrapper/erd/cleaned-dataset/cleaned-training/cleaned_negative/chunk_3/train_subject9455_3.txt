 I was enrolled in Calc II while taking Physics I and ran across no issues that couldn't be handled with a little research. As someone mentioned already, you may run into some integrals and derivatives that could possibly require interesting techniques to accomplish. This is also largely dependent on how your instructor approaches physics I as well as the text they use. For example, Kleppner and Kolenkowl's *An Introduction to Mechanics* would probably require a broader mathematical base in introductory physics. I haven't used this text so if someone here has they may be able to provide a bit more insight on the actual use of such a book in a course. If you happen to know what text you are using this could help us in providing more detailed direction as to what you may need to know. My calc based physics course used *Matter and Interactions* by Ruth Chabay and Bruce Sherwood. Wonderful text for conceptual understanding but not so much for intense mathematical representations of physical ideas. Using this book as a resource will certainly be helpful though. 




 I assume you ran into some obstacles in getting internships. If this is the case would you mind sharing what made it difficult for you? Perhaps you meant to convey that internships in general are difficult to attain. Thanks for your reply!
