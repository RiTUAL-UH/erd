 [Self-Compassion](http://www.amazon.com/Self-Compassion-Beating-Yourself-Insecurity-Behind/dp/0061733512/ref=sr_1_1?s=books ie=UTF8 qid=1337308524 sr=1-1 tag=acleint-20) by Kristin Neff shows how much better self-compassion is than self-esteem.  Not sure how you'd teach it to a 4-year-old but you and your wife could apply it to yourselves.  It's a good read. 







































 From the article:

If we think of the tax code as a set of incentives, rather than simply a mechanism to redistribute income, there are creative and effective ways to moderate the extremes of wealth, boost the pay of ordinary workers, make American companies more stable and efficient, and reduce the long-term federal budget deficit.

An astonishing contributor to inequality, then, is corporate bosses taking a larger share of the companys revenue for themselves.

Because current CEO pay numbers are so far out of the ordinary, its hard to argue that they are a natural outcome of the market.

Its difficult to estimate what combination of approaches will prevail, but whatever happens, it will be bring broad benefits to society as a whole, far outweighing the impact on the federal budget. 









 Upvote for terrific typo: *morose* for *more so* 



















 Uhm, those are not facts those are assertions and the editorial the OP adds doesn't even match the article. 

The so-called editorial line, *Privatization simply hasn't worked for health care, mortgage banking, higher education, or prison management,* is taken verbatim froom the article.  You don't consider that a *match*?
 






















































 When you tell your husband that the boob comments aren't welcome, what does he say?  You have told him, haven't you? 























































































































 ...for all *intents and* purposes, but that's a *moot* point. 















































































 Been to Cuenca yet? 














 What about the swaddling, shushing and the others?  Is there something wrong with every one? 



























































 Sorry and thanks.
 




 Damn, I wish the OP could be edited.  Thanks for that. 



















 The entire title and headline is taken from the article. 




 When I post something I've seen on Common Dreams I try to link to the original article, as is recommended. I hadn't seen the post by wang-banger. 




 The entire headline is taken from the article.  Let's see your pick of something to put after the article title. 




 We like it too. 




 Cross post away... 




 How would it be if thousands of protesters swarmed a city but not in clustered groups?  Just in twos or threes but all over a really wide area -- all peaceably carrying signs without obstructing vehicle or pedestrian traffic.  Make it so everyone in that city would continually see the protest.  




 Just heard a podcast about Michael Gazzaniga.  I'm planning to read [Who's in Charge?: Free Will and the Science of the Brain](http://www.amazon.com/Whos-Charge-Free-Science-Brain/dp/0061906107/).  Maybe you'd like it too. 




 **...there are a ton...** 




  There's no lack of clarity in *for you and I* but it still bugs me. I agree on singular *they* and sentence-ending prepositions.   




 I get annoyed at constructions such as *for my wife and I* or *just between you and I*. Does that make me dumb?
Actually my annoyance is more with the school teachers who always corrected *Johnny and me* to *Johnny and I* without providing any context. 




 From the article:
It has been my experience that many anti-authoritarians labeled with psychiatric diagnoses usually dont reject all authorities, simply those theyve assessed to be illegitimate ones, which just happens to be a great deal of societys authorities. 




 Some 'victims abroad' would probably disagree. 




 Seems it's you who is jumping the gun when you think he says anonymous comments are inherently wrong.  

What I saw was that they don't carry any weight. 




 Pick an area of the world about which you have some curiosity and go there.  Stay in hostels and guest houses.  If you get too bored there, go somewhere else in that country or to a nearby country.  Just stay out of your home country for several months, ideally 6 or more. 




 It's a mystery to me that this subreddit has managed to stay relatively sane and respectful.  :)  xoxoxy 




 Looks like an African elephant.  Can it be? 




 How about intelligence that is *grown* -- that arises from interacting with the environment?  Would that be considered artificial, or would it be 'true' intelligence comiing from an artificial entity? 




 The Nikon D5000 has a flip screen but it may be out of your reach.  If you can, borrow a camera with a flip screen and try it out.  

For me a flip screen has become a must-have.  But then I like the candid camera aspect and being able to shoot macros of ground level stuff without lying on my belly. 




 Better not to keep your camera in the 45L pack.  How about a waist pack?

And look into a flip-twist (articulated) LCD screen.  They are great for raising the camera over your head to see over crowds, for flowers and stuff close to the ground if you're into that, and especially for candid photos where people don't know you're photographing them -- people pay more attention to where you're looking than where the lens is pointing. 




 Why wouldn't you read the article before responding? 




 Not that kind of down.  Indifferent to hip-hop, bling seems like empty posturing. 




 I'm 74 and I know of many of us geezers who support OWS and are down on SOPA/PIPA, Citizens United and the rest of the corporatist agenda. 




 Deliberate government decisions to adopt austerity programs have tended to be followed by hard times. 




  We cannot help but be a society of strangers, yet underneath this, we cannot be a society at all unless we recognize our mutual obligations to one another. It is possible that our rude ancestors had it right all along: that obligations are more important than debts, and that amnesties are the key to economic and social order. Surely this question faces us now with a force that cannot be ignored. We are truly in each others debt, but it is a debt that extends beyond the mere payment of the sum of money.
 




 If you're in a state that's safe for Obama, like I am, you can feel okay about voting third party. 




 What are your thoughts on Cuenca? 




 It's a direct quote from the article but I admit the lack of context makes it confusing. 




 Loving the article first, that one blurb comes waaaaay after. 




 I remeber seeing something that persuaded me [range voting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_voting) was better than IRV.  There are so many [voting system criteria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRV_voting#Voting_system_criteria) that no single system satisfies them all. 




 Interesting to see the varied reactions.  They *all* seem ungrammatical to me when judging by SAE but I don't really stumble over any of them. 

I grew up in and have lived in several regions and countries so maybe getting used to 'funny' ways of talking is easier for me.  The differences are fascinating though. 




 [YES]  




 Thanks, after reading the links I understand the concern. 




 I recently subscribed to GMP but I'm not otherwise 'affiliated.' The article was interesting to me.

What's the touchy history? 




 It's directly from the Krugman article.  Before that it's of unknown origin though [widely used](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_beatings_will_continue_until_morale_improves). 




 Guess I do a pretty piss poor job of the clan/tribe/pack thing. When traveling in New Zealand and Australia I'd get into a rant and have local people reassuring me that they understood all Americans didn't support Bush. 




 Sure.  That line was taken directly from the article.  This says it better but is too long for a headline:

 Malone and Woolley didnt find that women per se were the key to a good C factor. Its just that social sensitivity, which was overwhelmingly the leading ingredient in high C factor, was overly correlated to women. In fact, when they controlled for the number of women in a group, it was shown that it was the emotional sensitivity scores which won out. So adding a woman to a team no more guarantees higher success rates than adding an Aaron to your dance party will make it a success.
 




 Thanks, that looks like what she needs. 




 My friend needs to be able to describe and tag her photos and then put them on a CD.  The CD would be for archival purposes and also to gives a copy to someone who didn't have an internet connection. 




 From the article:

 As we work on specific policy issues, lets organize with an eye toward building not coalitions but communities. In hard times, coalitions evaporate, but communities have a shot at surviving.
 




 I haven't seen it.  It's $26.25 from [2mminutes.com](http://www.2mminutes.com/products/pc/viewPrd.asp?idProduct=22). 




 He says:

Democrats continuously voted for Bush policies because they were either indifferent to their enactment or actively supported them, and were owned and controlled by the same factions as the GOP. 

What a strangle hold!
 




 This is the way evolution does it, I believe. 




 If the only way to prevent that is to do a search before submitting, I'm not sure that's always practical. 




 Do any agents search sites like reddit looking for possibile violations they can pursue?  How would they go about pursuing it? 




 Correct. 




 Interactive Brokers, because trades in my IRA account are only $1, with a $20/month minimum. 




 Which part of the article led you to believe he was advocating that someone else should decide what you listen to or watch? 




 Nope, just thought it was interesting. 




 This should be required reading for engineers, architects, city planners, building inspectors, and pretty much everyone over the age of 12.  And it would make a terrific movie. 




 Thanks.  That's what we'll do then. 




 There is cooperation among animals, though.  So worse than animals. 




 Not at all.  Just that there was some controversy in the link you posted. 




 You say that like it's the end of the matter. 




 Googling "joy of atheism" gets over 5000 hits.  Some of those have got to be inspiring. 




 After 3 trades, I'm better off than at $7 a trade.  I don't have to make 20 trades, just pay at least $20. 




 How much do you guys pay per trade with Schwab, BofA, Ameritrade?  On Interactive Brokers I pay $1 per trade with a $20/month minimum. 




 Does your condition affect the way you think?  The way you program? 




 You agree with the article and headline, then: 

Torture is not simply illegal, immoral and ineffective. It is also counter-productive.

The meaning of that is that torture is illegal, immoral, ineffective and counter-productive.
 




 In what ways do you expect genetics to contribute to social goals?  Is there a possibility that genetics can help with early identification of sociopaths?  Or even just greedy bullies?  It seems they have inordinate power over the rest of us who make up 99+% of the planet's population. 




 Native English.  Fluent Swahili with a somewhat limited vocabulary.  Some very rusty French and German.  Formerly a little Japanese, mostly forgotten.  




 It was passed by the Senate Health Committee and goes next to the Senate Appropriations Committee.  Different but still very good. 




 If there's something implied but not stated, it's more like **(supposed)** than **(about)**.  I don't sense this as a kind of future tense. 




 Easy enough to buy [Market Vectors Chinese Renminbi](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=CNY) but my small holding is only up a smidgen. 




 Your brush is too broad.  **alewis14151** is 67, I'm 73 and we are not the old people you're talking about.  I didn't even vote for Obama. Since I'm not in a swing state I didn't have to choose between a woman and a black man -- I voted for a black woman.
