 What is dark energy and how does it work? 




 Granted the "dark side" of the moon is an incorrect term (should be far side or opposing side), but it's a term that is generally accepted and understood ... and it makes a great name for an album. 




 Gold is inert to all chemicals it encounters inside the human body, which is probably why it is used in this application. 




 Instead, the [near-infrared laser] light excites the free electrons on the gold nanoparticles and causes them to heat up and generate energy, eventually making the cancer cells to explode.

Your guess is probably correct. The expansion/explosion of the cancer cell is likely caused by liquid within the cell that is heated by the gold particles and turned into vapor.

 It depends a lot on what you want to get out of the meet-up, but yes to all of the items you mentioned for Tom's meet-up.  I think this is one of the many methods Tom uses to build a strong community.  For me its a chance to meet and talk with people who are interested in technology.  Generally I find a connection that I didnt expect to make with a few people, and its not always about technology.  That's what makes these meet-ups interesting.  Tom was a very gracious and engaging host and Jennie was very good at introducing each attendee to the group. 

I asked my wife who also attended for her response to your question and this was her reply: 
 
 Definitely meetups are informal and are what you choose to make of them.  Expect to introduce yourself to people and try to find things you have in common. If you go expecting people to start the conversation for you, you may be disappointed. You dont have to imbibe in alcoholic beverages - some will, some wont but its non-discriminatory. 
 
 The subjects in which we engaged last night included:
 
 * Star Trek
 * Captain America/Agents of Shield
 * A guy walked by with an xkcd shirt on so that made for easy conversation
 * Whether to add an SSD to your computer
 * Whos still using XP (through no fault of their own)
 * The future of journalism (and what does it even mean)
 * Youtube subscriptions vs. Podcast subscriptions (and is it too hard)

 Good point regarding the mass of this body more likely putting it in the rogue planet vs. brown dwarf category. It appears the mass threshold for deuterium fusion is not precise and is more of a rule of thumb.  

From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_giant:

 The 13 Jupiter mass (MJ) cutoff is a rule of thumb rather than something of precise physical significance. Larger objects will burn most of their deuterium and smaller ones will burn only a little, and the 13 MJ value is somewhere in between. The amount of deuterium burnt depends not only on mass but also on the composition of the planet, especially on the amount of helium and deuterium present.[5] 




 Here's a good diagram showing the closest systems to our Sun including WISE's recent brown dwarf discovery.

 Yes, comets travel at very high speeds, but so do all the other bodies in space.  A comet's trajectory can be accurately projected for a rendezvous with a spacecraft, until/unless it comes close to the sun which may change its trajectory.  After a close encounter with the sun (if the comet survives) the trajectory will stabilize and can be recalculated. In any case, it is an impressive feat to land a probe on a comet.

Comets are significant in a few ways.  They contain information that sheds light on the formation of our solar system.  Many scientists believe that comets colliding with the Earth during its formation brought much of the water we have to our planet. There are also theories that comets may have brought life or the building blocks of life to the Earth since organic molecules have been detected in them.

 Evidence of primordial gravitational waves is the leading contender for the announcement.  
http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/mar/14/gravitational-waves-big-bang-universe-bicep 




 For a summary of the paper see this article: 

http://phys.org/news/2014-02-massive-neutrinos-cosmological-conundrum.html 




 Astronomers detected an exploding star in the M82 "Cigar" galaxy. It is most likely a Type Ia supernova, but yet to be confirmed. Type Ia supernovas are created when a white dwarf star collects so much matter from a neighbor that it becomes unstable, collapses upon itself and explodes in very predictable manner.  

Type Ia supernovas are used as "standard candles" to measure distances to very distant galaxies and how fast they are receding from us to determine the rate of acceleration of the universe's expansion.  Since M82 is so close, this is one of the rare Type Ia supernovas that can be observed by amateur astronomers.

 Here's a more technical explanation of ISON's fate.  
http://www.isoncampaign.org/potw-dec02

Bottom line is that ISON was sheared into smaller pieces as it passed through the Sun's corona.  Although some of the larger pieces could be seen exiting the corona, those pieces continued to evaporate/disintegrate (still pretty hot there) and nothing sufficiently large to observe as a comet now remains. 




 Now behind a paywall. Any other sources?

http://earthsky.org/space/big-sun-diving-comet-ison-might-be-spectacular-in-2013

 Why does this message not show up on Schiller's Twitter feed?  Looks suspicious.  Would be more credible if you posted the link to the tweet rather than an image capture. 




 You can't direct message someone on Twitter unless they follow you (I doubt Phil Schiller follows you) or they enabled the feature to allow DMs from those who don't follow them (I doubt Phil enabled this feature). The fact that your reply has an error shows he doesn't follow you.  Let's see your original DM to Phil where you called him out for saying Black Knight.

 You can get a free copy of the paper at the prl.aps.org site using this link

 Ok, I suspected this might not be the F, A, C, E musical notes. Many of your comments motivated me to analyze the notes since I don't have perfect (or even decent) pitch.  See this image for a visual of my analysis: http://i.imgur.com/O8JwHHK.png

Thanks to scottjenson for the Facetime ringtone which I used for this analysis.  

First I copied the ringtone into Garageband to visualize the notes in the time domain.  I suspected the first two notes were different from the rest in timing and pitch (maybe the F and A?).  Garageband showed me the timing of the first two is different, but of course nothing about pitch.  

Now to the frequency domain.  I downloaded a free app called iSpectrum which analyzes sounds played in real time through an audio input to your Mac.  I then played the Facetime ringtone and adjusted iSpectrum to focus on the frequency range from 1.0 kHz to 2.6 kHz.  I used the waterfall display where audio amplitudes (highlighted in magenta) are plotted as a function of frequency in the horizontal axis and time in the vertical axis (similar to what sonar operators use).  You can see I played the ringtone six times.  The magenta highlighted areas on the left are the first two notes (short in duration) and the highlighted areas on the right are the note pairs for the remainder of the ringtone (longer in duration). 

Unfortunately, the frequency resolution is not very good.  However, it's good enough to see that the first two notes are around 1.6 kHz while the trailing pairs of notes are around 2.45 kHz (+/- 100 Hz). 

I then went to the phy.mtu.edu site to see how musical notes map into frequencies.  I could not find any F notes that are close to 1.6 kHz nor could I find any C notes that are close to 2.4 - 2.5 kHz.  

My conclusions are 

* The Facetime ringtone notes do not spell FACE
* I'm spending way too much time on this

I'm out. 




 My thoughts exactly.  I'm guessing more info will emerge. 




 I assume you're referring to the statement: 
 There is a bit of a discrepancy regarding what to call the planet, as some astronomers demand that the definition of planet be considered a mass that is tethered to a sun.

The article is not well written.  I think the author should have stated that being tethered to a sun is one of the requirements some astronomers believe a planet should satisfy.
 




 Thanks hokie_u2 - that is helpful.  

I don't agree with Tyson's tweet "Mysteries of #Gravity: Why we enjoy a SciFi film set in make-believe space more than we enjoy actual people set in real space."

I've thoroughly enjoyed actual people set in real space over the years including the Moon landing, Felix Baumgartner skydiving from 128 kft (almost space) and Cmdr. Hadfield performing Space Oddity from the ISS, to name a few.  Knowing it's real makes it that much more interesting and enjoyable. 




 But these quarterly results will include a significant increase in sales of Apple's leading money maker. We'll see how this translates into revenue and profit.

 I was 12th in line at my local AT T store and had no trouble getting a 32 GB Space Gray, very efficient operation.

 The DJI Phantom is a good prosumer entry level quadcopter for very light weight cameras (e.g. GoPro).  To get decent arial footage, I recommend you get a gimbal to stabilize the image.  Although it's a bit of a hack, the Zenmuse H3-2D gimbal works well with the Phantom.  Realize that this can get expensive pretty quickly - what is your budget?

 I'm not sure, but it may have to do with the presence of water/ice on Mars and the possibility of finding some evidence of life on Mars.  The chances of finding signs of life on Phobos would be much smaller.   




 Thank you.  I also think r/space is an **awesome** subreddit.   




 If you're referring to its odd shape, it's not Phobos' fault.  There is something called the "potato radius" above which objects in the universe become sufficiently massive to form a sphere.  That radius is ~200 km for icy objects and ~300 km for rocky ones.  Phobos has a radius of only 11 km, so it has no hope of becoming spherical.

 Airplay is not related to networks so an "Airplay-app" doesn't make sense, unless I'm not getting your question.  Airplay is an Apple app supported by newer Macs and iOS devices that allows you to send whatever you are viewing on the device to your AppleTV and view it on your TV (known as mirroring).  

For older Macs that don't support Airplay, I use AirParrot ($9.99 US) to perform the same function. Doesn't perform quite as well as Airplay (likely due to running on an older Mac) but it gets the job done.

 I hadn't heard about Bluetooth Low Energy technology until this article. As I was reading, it hit me: BLE would be perfect for the iWatch (or whatever Apple chooses to call their wrist-worn personal device).  This revelation assumes that Apple will not stream music from the iWatch or place other high data rate requirements on the device.  

Below are the paragraphs from the article that got me thinking:
The tradeoffs of choosing BLE over standard Bluetooth are that BLE only supports very low data rates, so you wont be streaming audio via BLE any time soon  but you can send small files if youre creative, and it works extremely well for small data packets sent from sensors.

Devices built with energy efficiency in mind can achieve battery lives of several years running off coin-cell batteries like the CR2540. This makes them ideal for wireless devices that stay in one place and would be annoying to recharge. 




 I just realized the last sentence is similar to the Wizard of Oz's message to the Scarecrow. 




 Yeah, that is what I would call a really bad day.

 Very close to the Newton.  The circular shape on the watch face would suggest the Newton.  But 1) the circle on the face in the ad is proportionally larger than the Newton's, 2) the watch face in the ad is missing the bezel that surrounds the Newton's watch face and 3) the watchband in the ad does not taper outward to match the size of the watch as the Newton's band does.  This looks like a 6th gen square nano with a different watch face applied, possibly for obscuration? 




 They actually play this song (and many others) and are accomplished harpists, although I'm sure this recording is "finger synched" given the environment they're in. 




 Yep, that's the problem - your density is way too low.  A neutron star has a density of between 3.710^17 and 5.910^17 kg/m^3, which is about 14 orders of magnitude higher than the density you're using.  The material about to compress into a black hole would have an even higher density than a neutron star. Try the neutron star density and see what radius you get. 




 Where did you get that density? 




 I'm not sure what density you assumed, but your radius looks way to large to be the minimum radius required to form a black hole.  You may have used the density of iron that we observe here on Earth.  However in the process of forming a black hole, iron atoms are highly compressed so that the nuclei are nearly in contact with each other.  This is a form of iron that is many orders of magnitude more dense than what we observe on Earth.  The much higher density allows the minimum radius for black hole formation to be much smaller than your estimate. 




 First time for me as well.  I looked for an original post but couldn't find one. 




 I'd say a pretty good production ... FROM FRICKEN SPACE! 




 I can only hope that was a joke. If so, good on ya.  If not, heaven (or what ever your belief) help you.

 I recommend getting in touch with Allison Sheridan at http://podfeet.com.  She has been producing the NosillaCast Mac podcast for 8 years.  In addition she has produced a 12-part series companion podcast called Podcasting on Podcasting which is focused on helping people create their own podcast (http://www.podfeet.com/wordpress/podcasting-on-podcasting/).  

Allison learned from other generous podcasters and loves to pass on her knowledge to others.
