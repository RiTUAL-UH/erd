 Snake Oil!

It's a lot like Cards Against Humanity but with a sales pitch. One person is the "customer" (aka they'll have a card that says 'babysitter,' 'engineer,' 'beggar' etc) and everyone else will combine 2 of their cards to make a product. So instead of everyone just laying their cards down and 1 person picking their favorite, everyone pitches their product to the customer! If you play it with the right group, it's fun as hell.

 The only reason this should be wtf is if it was a gif and a fat woman riding a giant dildo burst out of the banana pile. 


Since it's not, fuck you OP 




 Not sure if OP is old enough to make comment about boobs, soooo...good luck on your future endeavors. Sincerely, sayoshinn.  




 OP, you are really asking it for it... 




 How often do you track how many friends you do and don't have on facebook at any given time??  




 I would like to throw a party for Kirby that's a big room of puddles for him to jump into and people to scratch his belly.  




 Maybe he's too dense to dance. 




 WHOA WHOA WHOA. This is not how Reddit works! You stick to your guns no matter how wrong you are and yell louder than everyone else! 




 I did not know you could do that. Cool! 




 I am with merqueen. When it comes down to it, yea Harry is the savior of the wizarding world (but not by any skill, genius or merit), he's just a kid. He's a teenager going through teenager shit. He's not the smartest, or the strongest or the fastest or cleverest. He's awkward, self-conscious, extraordinarily self aware and he's got a world of shit to deal with. Everything from trying to ask a girl to a dance from seeing friends murdered in front of him. But at the core he goes through things that teenagers go through, and through those tribulations he emerges [usually] victorious through his personal bravery, friends or simple dumb luck. If you're of a similar age, going through similar circumstances of self-doubt, awkwardness, often singled out and picked on, you look at Harry and think, "damn, I can do this too." 




 Wait, how are the Marlins so low? 




 Can someone explain this? 




 How the hell is this a confession bear? What's your next meme? An Awkward Situation Seal where you found out you donated the same amount of money to charity as your coworker?

 Fuckin Timmy 




 http://i.imgur.com/meAyRDZ.gif 




 When I was a counselor, I woke up in the middle of the night to take a leak. As I walked from the front to the back of the cabin, I noticed one of the top bunks where a camper (let's call him Timmy) should have been. Neither Timmy or his sleeping bag were on the bed. I peek out back, thinking maybe he went to take a pee and didn't tell me. Nope. Timmy's not out back. Maybe he went across the field to the bathrooms to take a dump? Go look out front. Peer across, no light on in bathroom building. But now I see a shadowy, hunched figure in the middle of the field. I approach, mag-lite, in hand. As I approach, the smell worsens and the faint sound of tears begins to become audible. I find little Timmy, alone in the athletic field, crouched in his sleeping bag full of shit. 

He had awoke that night and was too much of a pussy to walk to the bathroom in the cold, so he tried to hop in his warm sleeping bag. He couldn't make it fast enough and his body's need to shit soon overcame his weak mind. He stopped, dropped his pants (inside the sleeping bag) and shit inside his place of sleep. Once the relief of his massive shit passed, he realized what he had done, froze, and remained there in his humiliated tears for over an hour. He also peed. 

edit: gold cuz my camper shit himself in a sleeping bag?! thank you! 




 whoa whoa whoa that's not really a fair assessment. I think Markakis caught a ball last year.  




 ITT: People saying he could have spent more. Come on. How many stories of domestic abuse, drugs, DUI's, deadbeat dads etc among athletes come up?? And one stand up guy does something and you complain about the ratio of donation to salary?? $16,266 worth of toys puts a smile on a hell of a lot kids' faces.  




 You connect to people who have jobs so later when they want a new job they can ask you for an in at your job.  




 Markakis isn't getting close to $15mill a year so he wouldn't be a Lowe/BJ/Uggla situation. I'd guess he'd be looking at $8-10 mill? I wouldn't mind Aoki for the right price though. His LD% increased, and some peripherals like HR/FB and infield hit rate were actually lower than his first couple years. He doesn't strike out much either which is nice.  




 I tried to can into space once. It did not go well.  




 [How were the facts on Fox News today???](http://captainawkwarddotcom.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/mad-men-gif-not-great-bob.gif) 




 So you'd rather stick a minor leaguer that's not ready? Magically create a young stud RF that can develop in RF and hit his prime in 2017? Just bench every good player on lose every game until 2017? Put Jose Constanza in RF? You need someone to play there. There's no reason not to get a serviceable, veteran guy who can help mentor young players and won't (or shouldn't) cost that much. Let's be clear here. The Braves aren't turning into the Astros and tanking. They still want to be good, they just know the priority is rebuilding the farm system. Signing Markakis has absolutely zero impact on that. None. It doesn't hurt the team in any way.  




 Ah. the guy that throws out arguments without evidence, like "nothing more than an average MLB starter" (despite a 2.5 war last year) is suddenly Bill James. Play a sport once in your life before you think leadership is useless. Especially with a young team.  




 Have you ever played sports?? Leadership and clubhouse unity is incredibly important in baseball. Have a team with a bunch of kids that have gobs of money for the first time ever, are used to being the best and are now at the top of the baseball world and likely mightily struggling. The 'they're freaking adult baseball players, who cares about leadership' is the dumbest, most obtuse argument out there.  




 Fun until everyone starts rubbing their fingers along the rim of your glass. 




 He's a solid veteran leader to have around young guys and in the clubhouse. He improves the team's disastrous strikeout rate by giving a solid contact guy. Basically, see everything that /u/PM-ME-UR-PROBLEMS- said above.


And for your argument...show me where he's trending downward? You provide zero evidence. One could argue he's due for another increase in numbers. His BABIP last 2 seasons are well below his career norms, his K% has decreased, his contact rate has gotten better. If anything, the peripherals suggest he could improve his numbers. His LD% dipped in 2014 and his IFFB% jumped. So you could say that was an anomaly and will trend back to their respective means as well.  




 Player A: not on this team anymore so it doesn't even matter.
Player B: No one is pretending is a long term solution. And his numbers increased in 2014 from a poor 2013.  




 2014 Player Comparison

Player A: 573 AB / .271 AVG / .351 OBP / 735 OPS / 74 R / 155 H / 26 2B / 11 HR / 58 RBI / 67 BB / 98 SO

Player B: 642 AB / .276 AVG / .342 OBP /729 OPS / 81 R / 177 H / 27 2B / 14 HR / 50 RBI / 62 BB / 84 SO



Player A is Heyward, Player B is Markakis. Markakis makes better contact, strikes out less, and has just about the same line drive and HR rate. Markakis has slightly better numbers in O-Swing% and Z-Swing% and much better contact rates at O   Z-Contact% than Heyward. 

Yes, Heyward's defense more than makes up for any disparity at the plate (fangraps WAR for Heyward last year was 5.1 and Markakis was 2.5). But Markakis won't come with Heyward's price tag (after 2015) and gives us a higher contact bat in the lineup. Would I rather have Heyward? Yes, of course. But Markakis isn't bad.

 This happened in 2006! Here's [video proof for OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqXkLP7ZkU0) 









 How do I buy this?? 




 Fox News thinks that's too soon. 




 credit to /u/rkcr who had this idea in the thread of the Guardian article about 15 board games that make you a better person.  




 It wouldn't be the worst thing in the world if we traded him within the division. Generally when you make a trade within the division the price goes up. Could get an even better return on him. And then just throw him high fastballs 16 games a season.  




 I went to college with a girl who prided herself on being able to predict what type of food a guy had eaten the day before based on how their jizz tasted. She called it her "party trick." She was popular at parties.

**edit:** I don't think she could actually taste anything. I think she just liked dicks in her mouth. 




 My fault, you are right. He was just an out machine 




 On paper. And we had the 2nd worst offense, only to Padres, in all of baseball. Simba, CJ and BJ were strikeout machines. All of the infield, except Freddie, were black holes at the plate. Freddie slumped, didn't hit for power. Heyward got on base at a good clip, but didn't hit all that well. JUpton's numbers were buoyed by a few great streaks. One of which came in that big losing streak so it was wasted, not that that was any fault of his.

Why are people saying Chris Johnson was good at the plate this year???? Did you people watch games???  




 "Heyyyy...you!" 




 I think I just generally assume that places with the name of a person aren't owned by the most famous person with that name.  




 OP: "I'm from Canada" So? Is Newfoundland   Labrador only for dogs? 




 /r/Im14andthisisWTF 




 Where is the dog? Is it behind the paddington bear? 




 Well, I just went from real happy to sad in 3 pictures.  














 Where were the good hitters? 




 Hmmm, this was all what I heard on the news. I guess I'll go find some crow :) 




 74 inches in Buffalo in 24 hours is a US record 




 Once in a generation? Who the fuck is saying that? This is literally the most snow in US History in this time frame. 




 Hell yea. Keep on keepin on 




 Haters gonna hate hate hate hate hate 




 That's cool too. Everyone is different. 




 Hey man, it's the thought that counts.  




 Real men admit to whatever the hell they like 




 People need to stop looking at it like 'holy shit we traded heyward for shelby miller wtf.' 


Heyward has 1 year left on his deal, and by all accounts the Braves weren't going to be able to match what he may get on the market. Shelby Miller is young and, more importantly, has **4 years of control.** For GM's in baseball, money and contract control is HUGE. There's no way this trade would be done if each player had the same remaining contract length 




 Let go of the hate, man. Haters gonna hate hate hate hate hate. Shake it off.  




 This is the only comment that needs to be posted. 




 Samoyeds just always look like the happiest freaking dogs. Love those fluff balls 




 gasoline makes me run. back seat. trunk space. helllooooooooo.  




 I'm a grown ass man and I fucking love me some Taylor Swift. God dammit that girl can write a song. That said, I do think her decision to write a song about dog eating may have crossed a line. 


Edit for the haters: Real men admit to things that they like, whatever the fuck it may be. Life tip for guys: be confident in whatever you like, whatever you're into and own that shit. Chicks dig confidence, not name calling and poo-pooing other peoples' interests. 




 Your brother got ripped off. Those aren't boots or cars. 




 I'm downtown Buffalo. There's nothing here besides sunshine. It's crazy how the weather band is so exact. 5-6 feet of snow today in the Southtowns and nothing in Buffalo or Northtowns.  




 for people not living in WNY, that's a bit easier than saying West Seneca, East Aurora, Lancaster, Orchard Park etc.

 Here's the article for those without insider:


Monday's trade between the St. Louis Cardinals and Atlanta Braves indicates the Cardinals are going all-in for 2015. 

Jason Heyward is just a year from free agency, but that one year will be a very valuable one, even if he just maintains the status quo. Getting away from the parade of dubious hitting coaches he worked with in Atlanta may help him unlock the still-untapped reserve of superstar potential in his bat. 

Heyward consistently rates among the majors' best defensive outfielders in terms of both advanced defensive metrics and traditional evaluations. A decent center fielder in high school, he outgrew the position but maintains the athleticism and strong reads that allowed him to play there as an amateur. He's a smart, disciplined hitter who gets on base at a good clip and doesn't strike out excessively, though he has had a lot of trouble maintaining a consistent swing around some shoulder issues; he often cuts off his load, producing too many ground balls with a shorter swing path. 

Oscar Taveras' death left the Cardinals without a clear right fielder for 2015, and this move locks down the position for just $7.8 million, making the team 4-5 wins better right away. It also gives the team the chance to work with Heyward and see if they can make him the MVP candidate most folks (myself included) expected him to become. 

The Cardinals also get two years' worth of right-handed reliever Jordan Walden, who throws a heavy mid-90s fastball and has developed a plus slider. According to pitch f/x data from baseballsavant.com, hitters swung and missed at one of every five sliders Walden threw in 2014, and put just 1.4 percent of them in play for hits. It's an ugly delivery, and he always has had command issues, but I believe the Cardinals have some kind of special fairy dust they sprinkle on relievers to get a little extra something out of them. And even if I just made that up, he'll give them 50-60 above-average innings of late-game relief work. 

[+] EnlargeShelby Miller

Atlanta-bound Shelby Miller posted a 2.92 ERA after the All-Star break in 2014.
For their trouble, the Braves get two premium young arms, one ready to step right into their rotation and one who immediately becomes the best pitching prospect in their farm system. Shelby Miller now has two solid, healthy seasons as a major league starter and won't be eligible for arbitration until after 2015. He seemed to find the perfect formula for his pitch mix in the second half of last season, working in his curveball more and using the four-seamer less; in turn he missed more bats, got more called strikes and cut his walk rate substantially. He's a mid-rotation starter at worst, as long as he stays healthy, and given his delivery and the evolution of his approach, I believe he can end up as a solid No. 2 starter. 

Tyrell Jenkins was the No. 74 prospect for me going into the 2012 season, then shoulder injuries robbed him of much of that season and 2013. But he came back healthy this year and was one of the best prospects in the Arizona Fall League. When I saw him there in October, he was 93-96 with good downhill plane, turning the pitch over quite well even at 95 mph, generating lots of ground balls. His slider was plus at 83-87, with curveball depth, and actually got sharper into his second and third innings. His changeup was fringy, straight at 86-88, effective because his delivery of the pitch is close to his fastball delivery, but lacking any life or action. He's as strong as ever, and his shoulder is the healthiest it has been in more than two years. A former three-sport star who had a football scholarship to Baylor, he repeats his delivery very well and has the aggressiveness you'd expect (and want) to see from a former quarterback. He immediately becomes the team's top pitching prospect and should be ready to begin 2015 in Double-A. 

The trade makes a ton of sense for both teams, although it's an acknowledgment on Atlanta's part of the weaknesses of the current roster and farm system and may not read very well to some of their fans. The Cardinals are -- and should be -- in win-now mode; they needed to upgrade their production on the corners and have some pitching depth to play with. As good a prospect as Jenkins is, he has thrown just 215 innings in the last three regular seasons combined and has never pitched a full, healthy season in pro ball. They can replace Miller in the rotation with one of Marco Gonzales or Carlos Martinez, assuming Michael Wacha returns healthy to be the fourth starter behind Wainwright, Lynn, and Lackey, and they have other young arms on the way. 

Atlanta was likely to lose Heyward after the season to free agency, and their farm system was left in terrible shape after former GM Frank Wren's tenure, so this deal helps restock their system with four more years of Miller and potentially six of Jenkins in exchange for one year of Heyward and two of Walden. Atlanta needed to make a trade like this to get younger and extract value from Heyward while they could. The Cardinals didn't have the same urgency, but they strengthened a weak spot on the roster and did so without significantly damaging their future. 




 Ooo sorry, didn't even realize that. pasted as a comment. 









 so in the cooker, toss in the rice and all this other stuff (olive oil when it's done), cover with water and go? 




 Are these separate recommendations or all at once?? 




 I love white jasmine rice, but sometimes it's a bit bland after awhile. What are some quick easy ways to jazz up the flavor it. I usually just throw it in a rice cooker and mix it up with what i'm eating or put some butter on it as a side.  









 Yea, I'd prefer to not fly from Norway to Holland. I'd love to take a ferry/bus/train to take in all the scenery. Do you know what to expect on cost getting from Norway to Holland by land? 




 and possibly Austria after Holland. 




 Yes! I played it earlier this year at a demo day and it's a lot of fun. I'm not even a huge fan of Pandemic or co-op games in general. But this game moves quick, it's easy to pick up, there's a very good balance of luck and strategy. I'd definitely recommend it, even more so if you're a Pandemic fan.

 Ah that makes sense. MSRP slashed out, a few bucks less than amazon. Don't forget that shipping charge at the end on orders  $100 :) 




 Scoring is not opaque at all in Terra Mystica. It's just done differently than some other games. Instead of a linear progression of building more valuable/higher scoring buildings, there are **scoring tiles** for each round that give bonuses for that round only. 

For example, Round 1 might give a bonus for every spade used. Round 2 may give a bonus for every trading house built. So it's very beneficial to time your buildings (if possible) to coincide with the round scoring bonus. That and other things like the cult track are linear progressions...the higher you go, the more you score. When you build a town, get a bonus tile with points. Pretty straightforward. 

Side note: Terra Mystica is my favorite game of all time. Freaking get it! 




 Why do you not like Fantasy Flight games?? 




 I'm as confused as you are. [This is the only sale I see](http://www.coolstuffinc.com/page/1175) 




 That doesn't really seem like a sale. Jaipur is normally $17-$19 on amazon. Love Letter is $7. Everything else is usually pretty close to those prices, it seems like everything is maybe $5 lower than usual? 




 Where did you get KONY?! I'm still waiting forever for my pre-order! 




 ooo I missed that one. My bad. Taking this down to avoid the clutter 




 Can I list **Pillars of the Earth** 10 times? 




 **Twilight Struggle** we didn't score the scoring cards properly. We just took whoever "won" and what they got, and never scored the other person. So if someone had Domination, we never gave points to the other person for having Presence the first two games. No wonder the USSR blew out the USA early in both games, ha. Figured it out in game 3, and the game went muuuuch more balanced.  




 Great week of gaming!

Mid-Week I hung out with a friend and we played an intense game of **1st   Goal.** I turned the ball over 4 times, got 3 penalties, lost 2 onside kick attempts, and my buddy had no turnovers, no penalties and won an onside kick. I got stomped, but it was so much fun. The game is just fun. You can't take it seriously or else you'll get frustrated! Just a silly game, with some strategy/trying to know what your friend is going to play.

Sunday night we ended with a great game night after football. Game of **Small World**, which I'm not the biggest fan of, and ended up finishing 3rd. It's a good game, but I've just been more into heavier games lately and this just never clicked with me since I learned it a couple years ago. 

2nd up was a 4 player game of **Terra Mystica**. I got the Nomads and tried to expand as fast as possible early. I ended up being kinda mean, cutting off 2 people and won in the end by a good margin. I was lucky too, as the 1st round scoring tile was for dwellings, the 2nd for trading houses so I lined those up nicely. I absolutely love this game. It's my favorite of all time. Especially with 4-5 players so there's much more interaction and territorial conflict. Everything just fits together so so nicely. And it is gorgeous to look at.


We then moved on to a quick game of **Tichu**. Such a great 4 player/pairs of 2 game. Love the dynamic of the dragon/phoenix and scoring cards. 


A couple friends left so to the end the night, my friend and I busted out **The Duke** for my first time ever. WOW. This game is brilliant. I love it. So simple, lots of strategy, some luck/randomness in which tile you randomly draw. I wonder what would happen if you made a variant where you don't randomly select which tile to draw: just leave em all out on the side and you can pick which one you want every time. Thoughts on that? 




 Tichu is *fantastic!* My group just played a few games last night. The dynamic with the dragon and phoenix is very interesting. There's a lot going on here. It seems a simple trick taking game, but there's definitely depth, strategy and tons of replay-ability 




 It's awful. 




 Hit up Osteria last night. They had a real solid menu for restaurant week. Lots of options. 




 No worries! Also looks like there's a similar package available for the houses if you need as well, with listed weights and dimensions 




 [Looks like this has the answer](http://www.amazon.com/Plastic-Hotels-Replacement-Miniature-Buildings/dp/B00DTXJV96/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1413995509 sr=8-1 keywords=monopoly+red+hotel)


It says that each piece is 1.1grams with Dimensions at 19 x 13 x 13mm 




 Haha, I think that would more be a job for the mods.  




 Thank you for posting this, I had forgotten it was starting yesterday! 


Thought: Is there anyway to make this a "sticky" or keep it in the top bar during the duration of the auction period? I think it would be nice to keep it up front for the next few weeks to get as much notice as possible.
