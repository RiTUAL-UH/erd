 I'm wondering if this type of movement would be applicable to improve all-terrain vehicles, maybe something kind of like that robotic pack mule. Probably not because of the whole volume to surface area ratio thing. Even if it was, I'm sure this would have been at least considered in the engineering process of the robot mule. 




 Well he also started drinking so heavily after Watergate that his staff actually had to take the nuclear codes away from him. [Source](http://books.google.com/books?id=kasyAwAAQBAJ pg=PA79 lpg=PA79 dq=nixon+drunk+nuclear+codes source=bl ots=aHPhopAtjV sig=KcdZTb9gJSOUcBILMKq7GxPr1ds hl=en sa=X ei=3GJLU43wEMnO2wWCtoCYCA ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage q=nixon%20drunk%20nuclear%20codes f=false)

He was a pretty shitty guy in all reality and might have started a nuclear war if he had been able to. 




 SUBTLE LIKE MY DICK IN YO MOMMA 




 If I could actually write, I would have had the character turn to run and see another one in that direction. Turn a different direction, same thing.  




 Hahah I'm sorry but I had to edit that. I kind of feel bad because it was almost too perfect of a typo but that's just too embarrassing. 




 I know, right? Imagine walking through somewhere like the woods or a poorly lit park at night and seeing something weird out of the corner of your eye. You look and its one of those things just standing in the distance. After a moment or two it starts slowly walking toward you. As it gets closer you begin to notice there are others surrounding you doing the same thing and there's no where to run, no way to get away.

I wish I could actually write well because I feel like this would be scary as shit, but I'm just a lowly engineer.

Edit: I wish I could put into words the scenario I'm imagining, creative writing is fucking harder than I thought. If someone wants to actually make this into a well written scary story go for it.
 




 I don't remember learning about anyone other than Einstein and Bohr throughout any of my schooling up until college/ 




 Ah, welp looking back on what I wrote he's right. I had to pull an allnighter last night getting ready for a couple exams I've got on Monday so I'm not exactly the most coherent person right now and those study aids make me ramble like a mad man too. 




 This is going to sound really condescending but I don't understand why stuff like this is a big deal and gets so many up votes just because someone is wearing something related to reddit. If I saw something like this I would probably think "oh cool he must really like Reddit" and go on my way.

 Reddit is one of the biggest if not the biggest social media aggregate sites on the internet.
 It's not like it's some like super secret esoteric club, I'm 24 and almost every single one of my friends goes on Reddit at least occasionally. I just feel like sometimes people have this idea that it's a close knit community and you're automatically going to be great friends with someone just because they are a redditor too and I just don't think that's the case. 
But hey, I guess Karma is pretty cool. 




 What are you talking about? I'm talking about the 2chan denko thread, which is what the 2 comments above mine were referencing. If you haven't read it, you should do it, it's possibly the most cringy thing on the internet 




 After reading that, I can't help but feel a little sorry for the denko guy he was just naive, a bit off his rocker and incredibly socially maladjusted(not that that excuses any of his behavior). Her shitty friend on the other hand, was the true villain who knew exactly what she was doing, what a sociopath.  




 Honestly, whenever something like this happens I just type the acronym into google and the meaning of the it pops right up at the top.

 As far as anyone knows, Jim had never done heroin and didn't overdose on it that night. He was sober and with his girlfriend, he said he felt sick and went to take a bath and she found him dead about an hour later in the tub. Source: No One Gets Out of Here Alive... his biography.

 This happened at least once in Austin this year too 




 Here it is [enhanced](http://i.imgur.com/Lf3lPPY.jpg)... holy shit 




 Any idea how big the DC metro area is compared to say, the Atlanta metro area? How long does it take to drive to DC from NOVA?

Also I've always heard DC is the one of the most dangerous cities in the US? Any idea how it compares to say Atlanta? In case you can't tell I live in ATL so I'm just trying to get a reference 




 You're a true hero... Is this all in Austin?  




 nd the time Cory and Trevor leave. I fuc 




 Too lazy to think of a title and stuff... you can do it if you want 




 Here's a video of the paint being added http://vimeo.com/45021408 




 I would think  it's possible that dogs are innately able to recognize some human aspects better than animals because of the thousands of years of selective breeding. It would be interesting to take at look at the difference of response in wild dogs.

The way dogs naturally communicate puts a lot of emphasis on the tone of the barks and other vocalizations so I would think they would have some response. My guess is the wouldn't understand what is trying to be conveyed as well because they don't understand what different tones signify for humans. 




 No... pitch has nothing to do with volume, it is how deep or high pitched your voice is. It's kind of hard to define tone now that I think about it, I guess it's the way you say things so I guess tone depends on your cadence. 




 I like HotWheelz personally 




 Yes but .001 is not equal to .001%. .001 is equivalent to .1%. If you were trying to get 1% of something you would multiply that something by .01. 5% you multiply by .05. 90% you multiply by .9.

I know how to do basic math maybe you should take a second to actually read what I'm saying 




 That's .1%! To get 1% of something you multiply by .01 not 1 




 This is wrong... just because a pattern is random and non-repeating doesn't mean it contains everything...  




 Actually .001% of 7 billion is 70000 




 What are you talking about 




 I was just talking about this particular reference to Gloria 




 It's from the show Modern Family 




 I had a friend in college who completely went off the deep end. Gradually over the course of a couple weeks he got farther and farther removed from reality. He bought his close friends all kind of gifts that there was no way he could afford, completely destroyed his apartment, writing all over the walls and trashing it, and was convinced people we after him. He even thought at one point he had created a light saber and the FBI had broken into his house and stole it. He moved out of his apartment and began living on a volleyball court behind our fraternity house(he was a brother too) in a tent. This all climaxed when he took off all his clothes and started walking around the house naked with a knife in his hands. Scary stuff, the mind is a delicate thing. 




 Some people equate legality with safety. They think oh if it's legal it must be safer than actual weed when the reality is very much the opposite.  




 I live 10 minutes down the road from you on 620 and I had no idea it actually iced over. Where was this? 




 actually it's /r/casualiama... was confused when I only saw 150 subscribers 




 I doubt that local business in Africa would be able to compete with mass produced cheap clothing anyways... It's not like if they didn't donate these shirts, all mass produced clothing would stop making it to Africa. 




 Why the fuck do you work in a bathroom stall? 




 My direction in life is not too bad. I'm taking a semester off now but will graduate in the fall with a masters in biomedical engineering. I have severe anxiety and have don't really have any friends back home which is where I am now. I'm a bit social inept and a lot of times I have trouble holding conversions especially which people I don't know. It's hard to find hobbies because everything I once enjoyed doesnt seem interesting due to the depression. I am trying to work my way out of this, have been on anti depressant for 5 years but the only thing that makes me actually be able to enjoy life is opiates and obviously thats not an option.

Something is just wrong with my brain chemistry I think. Even back in the when my first hook up was with the girl who ended up prom queen I still thought about suicide alll the time 




 After being incredibly depressed over half my 23 year old life, it makes me jealous as fuck 




 I'm the same way. I couldn't stand to think how my family would react. I don't want to die so much as just never have existed in the first place. I guess being chronically depressed for over half my life will do that to you 




 Those speed holes do wonders 




 He's never seemed super full of himself to me, is there a story behind this? 




 I could definitely see him being a dexter style serial killer and he'd be fucking good at it too with his crazy work ethic 




 And he appealed the decision and was later acquitted! 




 Ah yes, the old Siemen's tower next to Dick's sporting goods in Cumming 




 Eatin my own shit, bitch I dont give a fuck, chomp'em in the nutz then its time to get buck 




 I'll take a large coffee with sugar and cream! Thanks! 




 I still wish they could have finished Mt. Rushmore, [this](http://i.imgur.com/mGF1sYa.jpg) would have been a badass giant sculpture, not that it isn't pretty awesome anyways 




 Well at least it's not the WORST possible outcome. Wear a cup when you're playing lacrosse guys... trust me 




 P-chem? Ewwww... it was cool at your school? 




 It's too bad what happened to Hartman. I'm not sure if it's fair to blame Andy Dick for his death, he's certainly a bit responsible but he never had any intention to hurt anyone. Still you don't fucking offer a recovering addict drugs

 I read somewhere that the character of Zapp Brannigan was originally written for Phil Hartman(who voiced Troy McClure, Lionel Hutz in the Simpsons), I'm not 100% sure this is true but it would have been perfect. 
 




 They probably would be some of the most interesting people to trip with. Wish they woulda won, would have loved to see trey give that speech 




 Not saying I believe in aliens or anything but I've never understood the "why" question about aliens visiting us. This is a planet absolutely filled to the brim with life not to mention intelligent life. I imagine that would be a bit of a rarity. 




 Look up sleep paralysis. What you described seems very similar to that(although I'm sure it was still terrifying!)  




 I've heard pretty lights has/had a big OC problem and  would often refuse to go onstage if he wasn't high. Know anything about that? 




 He said he was on a "low dose of LSD" while he came up with the double helix structure idea 




 Oh sorry officer, that one has been sitting in my car for a month. Here's one that is fresh 




 WHAT SOME OF THE MOST ATTRACTIVE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD LOOK SIMILAR 




 Yeah that's actually what I meant to include as a counter to his point but I just now realized what I posted actually seems like evidence of his point, time to edit 




  A "prisoner" begged to leave and Zimbardo allegedly "encouraged" him to stay to the extent that the prisoner returned to the other prisoners, telling them that, "we aren't allowed to leave". There were also other instances where people were kept against their will and not because of social embarrassment.

From http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1pt80c/psychological_experiments_gone_horribly_wrong/cd5w6k7

It seems he "encouraged" participants to stay but did not say you're allowed to leave. According to a reply to this post a couple student actually did leave the study.
 




 I was born in Poughkeepsie. Glad to know my hometown is keeping up the good work 




 I remember seeing this book sitting on the coffee table at home and seeing the cover. A little bit of me died that day, life was never the same and it definitely didn't help my fear of the dark, although I was more scared of being abducted by aliens than anything else.

I was a strange child. That alien phobia never quite went completely away and I've told friends about it recently. If they ever play a practical joke on me involving aliens I honestly would freak the fuck out. Especially if it was anything like this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hl8lnZjMcos

 That drop kick has a better spiral than I can throw damn 




 "I did not sow, I did not spin,

And thanks to pills I did not sin.

 I loved the crowds, the stink, the noise. 

And when I peed, I peed turquoise. 

I ate beneath a roof of orange; 

Swung with progress like a door hinge.

 'Neath purple roof I've come today 

To piss my azure life away. 

Virgin hostess, death's recruiter, 

Life is cute, but you are cuter. 

Mount my pecker, purple daughter 

All it passed was sky-blue water."

Little easier to read that way. 




 What's the legality of doing something like that? I'm guessing just a scummy legal thing to do but if you were say to have those posts/emails linked to you conclusively would there be any legal recourse? 




 Kinetic energy is .5 * mass* velocity^2. So nope velocity is very relevant.

 His best part has to be Frank's cape wearing lawyer though 




 Yeah it makes you wonder did score try to account for that or just get kind of lucky? 

I'm pretty good at skill shots and most times I'll just throw them where I think the enemy will be. I'm sure a lot of variables contribute to where I place them but aiming the shot happens so fast I could never really explain my thought process, only that I felt the player would move there so I aimed there. I wonder if it's the same type of deal. 




 Amazing. If cait would have just kept running instead of trying to dodge it, it would have probably missed but that instinctive dodge when you see the ult appear is really hard to control 




 I wonder if it was all about them touching each others butts

 I go to school at Georgia Tech, but I'm from Texas and honestly Atlanta is still worse in terms of racism. I think it has something to do with the large black population of the city, especially in the areas around campus which are significantly worse off. I think it has a lot more to do with socioeconomic status than race but around here black and poor really do seem to go hand in hand and this stereotype is often re-enforced. 




 Looks like its going down down in an earlier round  




 Ah cool figured it was a BB or something. I put it first cause i thought it was the coolest looking.

 Yeah considering drug legalization doesnt effect addiction rates [^1](http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/europe/120718/drug-decriminalization-portugal-addicts), it is much better for people to get unregulated black market drugs than regulated, pure drugs which they would be using anyways.  




 For me a bad trip on acid(never had a bad one on shrooms) is kind of like taking the anxiety and uncomfortable feeling I get when I'm too high or in the wrong environment and multiplying it by 10. I've tripped probably at least 40 times, the last time over a year ago. That was such a bad trip I had to leave my friends because I was paranoid and was at the point where my mind was racing too fast to even be able to form coherent sentences. By the time I wanted to say something, my mind was already somewhere else so anything I said would have be incoherent babble.

I've also convinced myself I was crazy a couple times and that this time I had taken it too far, taken too much acid and I was never gonna come back down. Those trips sucked a lot but a good trip on acid is equally as mind blowing, in an opposite, amazing way.

TLDR: Acid is a hell of a drug  




 Admittedly, I do not know much about linguistics but languages fascinate me. Years ago, when I was in high school I remember browsing the wordreference forums where a similar question was asked and there were some languages with properties that astounded me.

I can't contribute, studying languages unfortunately took a back seat to engineering for me after high school but I figured this would be the best place to ask. 

I may xPost to askReddit if this gets enough interest.  




 signs*

Just have to point that out considering you did it five times 




 Here ya go 
 Because the liberal left has convinced everyone that McCarthy was as bad as Hitler. The dude was pretty much right, and the rise of state-owned assets and banking which is a component of socialist thinking is what led to the crisis we're in right now. Most Americans, and redditors for that matter, can't accept that voting people in to spend other people's money regardless of whether or not they deserve that money could lead to a shortage of that money and a resistance to hiring to spend that money.

 I was at Bonnaroo one year when he was headlining the last day(think it was 2011?) which means he was the only show at the time at a festival of 100,000+ people. So, a fucking huge crowd to say the least and one of my favorites shows I've ever seen but what really stood out to me was there was a girl in the very front row with a shirt that said "It's my birthday today!!!". He proceeded to call he up on stage in between songs and get the entire crowd(at least 80,000 people) to sing her happy birthday. He has always seemed like the most down to earth celebrity and that just cemented it for me. 




 If you get this up in arms about bow hunting you need a reality check... Nature is fucked up, humans are fucked up and neither you or anyone else are ever gonna change that. Hope self perceived moral superiority makes you happy 




 I understand the dislike of people killing for fun with guns but for food with bows and arrows? Like people did for hundreds of thousands of years? The kind of killing that is constantly happening in nature? Granted it's with simple tools, but that's kinda our equivalent to a bear's claws and strength.  




 Yeah I bet you have a whole bunch of em for the native New Zealanders 




 Oh yeah and so much more humane than buying chicken that comes from a fucking chicken factory where the chickens literally cannot move, are covered in their own shit and surrounded by dead rotting corpses. 




 It's amazing how well you were able to show that you're an arrogant ass and a racist and also a lot less intelligent than you think you are. In only two sentences too!
