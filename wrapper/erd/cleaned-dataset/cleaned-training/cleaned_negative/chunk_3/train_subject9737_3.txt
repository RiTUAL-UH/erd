 Looking in the mirror; getting older.  




 My grandfather has Alzheimer's and sometimes I have to take care of him. I am 22 and my 76 year old Grandpop makes me so scarred to grow up, get old, and totally become a baby again.

Sometimes, I get these scary visions of when my mom, future SO, or even myself will get like this and it just reminds me how scary time is.
