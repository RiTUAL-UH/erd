 Subbing.

I grew up in the [Christopher Erb house](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Erb_House) in Maryland. Let me know if you want a post about it.

200yr old stone German immigrant house. Basement is center wall, the two stories and attic above are center hallway. Our floors are so crooked. There is a sister house and my personal theory is that the Erbs started to make a split floorplan but saw [Hampton Mansion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampton_National_Historic_Site) after finishing the basement and decided to change the plan.

Not until I happened upon a book about the similarities between the [Zwaanendael Museum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zwaanendael_Museum) and the building it (in part) replicates did I know about jointery markings. The specialized language of rafter joining. I'd been sleeping under the exposed rafters for years.

The house is a form of Georgian colonial architecture.

 If you think media portrayal has any negative effect on the situation, then it isn't a distraction when a paper shows itself to be staffed by barking mad yellow writers.

Also, you heard that Freedie had back surgery and should have been in bed rather than selling drugs? Backed up in court documents. 




 The mayor is secretary of the DNC and it seems she may have been enabling the protestors, so this is actually a step out of tyranny in a strange way. 




 Some businesses have insurance against these instances, as well. I can't imagine it would do much good. Many won't and stuff like this makes that insurance go up. 




 I do believe that is *my* cue.

 If only people realized that they and their governments are responsible for those walls. The people who have prosperity are not responsible for needing protection from those who are desperate but oppressed.

Opening all borders would be even better, not because it would allow the needy to escape but because it would allow the prosperous to spread.

  ...due to natural factors.

I am here to challenge that specific part of your answer. Not to say "I disagree," but to ask if you have considered the information I will share. It suggests that the perceived climate change event was actually man-made through a lack of understanding.

There are other authors who have stated this, but David R. Montgomery is the one which seems most accessible. His book [Dirt: Erosion of Civilizations](http://smile.amazon.com/Dirt-Civilizations-David-R-Montgomery-ebook/dp/B007V2D4JO) is just long enough to remark on many different instances of the phonomenon of erosion caused by agriculture dooming a population. He summarizes the book and shows some data which was left out for audience tailoring in [this lecture.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQACN-XiqHU)

The floods, famines, and desertification of much of the meditarranean and middle east can be attributed to the cutting down of trees and plowing of loose soils until gone. Ur was a port city and now lies a hundred miles inland. The mountains of the levant used to be lush but are now dusty crags.

It does not seem that cyclical events caused the agricultural failure. [Milankovich cycles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles) and [DansgaardOeschger events](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dansgaard%E2%80%93Oeschger_event) could be, but I have not seen anyone claim it.

So the peoples of the Bronze Age ruined their land. This caused floods when there was no more soil and wooded plains to soak up the rain; famines when soil died under the knife of the plow; and a lack of strategic resources when wood was burned for fuel. This followed a population increase dependant on the use of deforested land. Once that land was desertified and decreased in yeild, scarcity strained the social structure.

I'm not an expert and I probably could have just dropped the link on you and asked the question "have you read this and do you agree?" instead of writing all that but I did. 














 If you want a good look at a system, I highly recommend this video [on earthships](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efI77fzBgvg). Don't go crazy for them - that is all the advice I can give you. It is easy to get sucked into such a simple and complete idea that you forget all your good ideas and personal opinions. Don't spend time watching and reading every thing there is about earthships... especially when there is work to do! 




 I went through MIT's Open Courseware for a few classes. The following are links to pages which lis the readings and even have direct links to Amazon for the book.

* [Fundamentals of Energy in Buildings](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/architecture/4-42j-fundamentals-of-energy-in-buildings-fall-2010/readings/)

* [Introduction to Architecture   Environmental Design](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/architecture/4-111-introduction-to-architecture-environmental-design-spring-2014/readings/)

* [Introduction to Building Technology](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/architecture/4-401-introduction-to-building-technology-spring-2006/syllabus/)

* [Daylighting](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/architecture/4-430-daylighting-spring-2012/readings/)

You might look at the reviews and selected sections refereneced in the courses, then try to find books locally. Maybe your professors have copies you can read from and scan. 




 That is a reason to make the law, but it isn't necessarily a need when the fines can be upheld in courts no problem and people are just as likely to not fight it. 




 TBH I'm almost surprised the gulls weren't already eating it.

 The point of the question is that the law didn't need to be created for the fines to be collected, the understanding of previous laws just needed to be brought up to date. 




 I remember doing labs on hair identification in highschool maybe ten years ago. This made it into the curriculum. 









 *raises hand*

How do we stop Serbia and Croatia from quickly resolving the territorial dispute and eliminating Liberland while you piss them off? 




 Hopefully he'll survive... I mean 100KRONER 




 That also holds for the cost of capture and trial, right?

I think in normal session law the boundaries would be set for the various things which go into each. The salaries, facilities, and processes will all have to be fleshed out in various ways and then codified. 




 I thought initial citizenship would be a necessary addition to the constitution, as well. But right now the nation is under the temporary leadership of a separate body. Initial membership would be handled by them and standard citizenship and naturalization would be handled in normal laws. 




 I think you are referring more to fines. I am talking about the administrative cost to perform whatever punishment is deemed necessary: the wages for the clerk who files the fine and the equipment for that.

How much could it be, right? But it is there, in the constitution, so it has to be fixed. 




 If he is labelled as inherently threatening, that could be the immediate conclusion.

The extreme example brings to mind a lone hero riding to the gates of the walled city of Liberland... half dead on his horse. He comes bearing important news but is turned away or shot with an arrow...

In real life, if you want to come back just ask to speak to a diplomat. Showing up at your ex-spouse's front door asking to be let back in isn't the right way to do things.

(not that govt is a spouse to anyone. blech.) 




  .28. No Citizen shall be deprived of the citizenship under any circumstances, nor shall he or she be extradited to another jurisdiction against his or her will.

I wonder why the authors chose to prohibit the act of outlawing someone. 




  .26. Convicted criminals shall not have their liberty restricted except so far as is necessary for the protection of others, nor their property seized except so far as it is necessary to make restitution to the victim and/or to pay the costs of the criminal's capture and trial.

The last line might need to include the cost of punishment.

 To that I say: Soldiers throughout time have been expected to carry from 40 to 80 pounds at any time marching, and sometimes approaching that in arms and armor during battle. A soldier would usually not experience extended periods of sustained combat, rotating front lines and repeated charges with short breaks have been much the norm.

 I don't think so. 




 So are you going to take your cheap internet points and run or go look at the vibrant communities of professionals and enthusiasts who spend hundreds of dollars and thousands of hours learning about swords and their use? 




 "Modern swords" can mean a few things. You probably either mean swords of modern design (fantasy blades and such) or swords of ancient design made with modern technology (reproductions). It actually makes no difference because there is a reason swords ended up with the weights they did in the time they were used - that was the balance of power and agility desired. Even as carbon content increased with more steel (bringing on rapiers and the like), the weight stayed within a consistent range.

Most swords are about three pounds.

Does that sound "heavy" to you? That is less than half the weight of a gallon of milk. A sword cannot be too heavy because of the nature of the balance. Your hand is the fulcrum of a lever and on one end is more weight that the other. 




 Kenneth Branaugh is another one, for me. 




 "Swords are heavy" is a misconception.

 OK, but I still don't feel like voting for war. And a vote for Rubio is a vote for war. 




 Tried to help, since I am interested. I get the question as "is there a book dedicated in part or whole to passive systems with charts and formulas and software examples?"

Did this path: [wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/architecture/wiki/index), [link from wiki](http://www.archtoolbox.com/books/best-architecture-books.html), [book from link](http://www.archtoolbox.com/books/book-reviews/heating-cooling-lighting.html), [review from book](http://smile.amazon.com/gp/review/RRVGFBSAXCJVE/ref=cm_cr_pr_viewpnt?ie=UTF8 ASIN=0470048093#RRVGFBSAXCJVE)

Guess that didn't work.

I have one of these books [on earthships](http://earthshipstore.com/Earthship-books?__hstc=61572723.6a73846a560c406233df55714c634007.1429652898840.1429652898840.1429652898840.1 __hssc=61572723.1.1429652898841 __hsfp=1653858344) at home. It covers passive and ventilation.

But my next attempt would be looking at the various reading lists from open courses and college courses. Harvard, UMD, so and so...

 You're right, but people trying to get away from mainstream news have been exposed to backlash against the Laffer Curve theory and don't support it anymore - correctly. However, not all in this category know the difference.

 It makes sense for libertarian scientists to run, because they wouldn't have to debate or decide what to regulate, how... they'd just deregulate. 




  I felt like it never even occurred to the author that I might be consciously making a choice.

People do make choices, but those choices are affected by the political structure in which they live, including coordination with businesses at various levels.

Another given in Strongtowns articles is that the sprawl occurred during a wasteful period and that tax revenue from suburbs rarely are enough to support the infrastructure. Just as local governments spent money poorly, so too have many American families - it can be hard on families to justify living in the suburbs when they would much rather exchange the nature and freedom with ease of access to jobs on cheap mass transit and high proximity to wants and needs. The problem comes from the market having been twisted away from dense construction of a quality which enables this. People complain about schools and crime, and the construction in cities recently is either for colleges, singles, or well-off families.

So why is that? American families *want* suburbia but many cannot afford it and would do well to move in. They can't because their house won't sell; they won't because they don't think it is a choice which will make them happy, safe, or prosperous; they can't because builders see basically no demand. Meanwhile, the tax receipts on sprawled areas are putting American towns in debt.

It can come off as insulting. I'm not going to lie. Strongtowns is facing this problem where people disagree because they think the writers disapprove of their choices. We just wish you had more choices, but known the *real cost* instead of having political involvement muddy that.

I, personally, drive 20-30 minutes to work. I live on the edge of a major city and can walk to grocery, gym, park, and church. Also, school, if we had kids. 




 I think the focus would be more beneficial on the aversion, reluctance, and inability to live more densely.

 Don't worry, the repost will do fine. 




 Ah. I would count social conditioning as the opposite of something being thought about, but morals do appear in both cases of pressure and engineering.

So when I said reflection it meant an image, not a philosophical viewpoint (but it could have meant both). That was a little lazy of me. 

 We are made to be very very good to out fellow man, but only the good we think about.

 *or are forced to contend with due to social pressure*, as you point out.

 And then, only to people we define as fellow man.

And boy, that is the mother of all "nurture" scenarios.

What made Mal such a great character, and what makes everyone pine for the unexplored depth of the characters and universe, is that mix of social pressure and constructed morals. I think we felt like those people on the tiny space boat showed us more about ourselves than we wanted to know, but in a slightly-detached way which made it easy to enjoy, rather than suffer through. 




 I do not agree morality is "intrinsic" but do agree it isn't proprietary of any religion, rather it is a reflection on our humanity and the limits of our nature.

 And that bad chick from Iron Man three was his girlfriend (by name) if I recall. 




 Well it is between how stupid she is and how willing to flip-flop to get the young vote she is.

I think she really cared about that issue.

It will almost definitely come down to *what* young vote she'll try and get... probably the Tumblr one. She is all about social justice and not realyl about connecting with anyone male that isn't in a union. So she'll probably try and institute some kind of mature game registration or a new rating for inclusiveness or something. She won't ban them, just put layers of control on them.

That is, if the legislature returns to the Dems. I need to look up on that chance for 2016, but anything is possible two or four years after that. 




 It depends what your priorities are. A lot of people are pretty enthused on the Republican side. A blaze article on Hillary's announcement mentioned Lincoln Chafee and Jim Webb as possible Democrat contenders. Lincoln will need a new haircut, at the very least. Jim Webb is hoping he'll be able to quickly move past all the scandals already in his past (substantial or not). 




 Well that isn't personally tragic. 




 If by that you mean qualified at completely screwing whatever pooch she's tied to and getting away with it, then ok.
