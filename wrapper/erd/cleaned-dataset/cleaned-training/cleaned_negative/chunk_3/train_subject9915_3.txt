 In my line of work? I work as a technology consultant in the wine and spirits industry, often with executives and business managers. Unfortunately no wild stories there. 

If you're talking about me being a Priest, I don't openly declare this so no I don't get that there either. 




 I can only speak for myself, but I paid the $200 because I spent time with a number of Church of Satan members and agreed with what they were doing in the real world and would like to see this kind of work supported on a broader scale.  For the same reason I donate to NPR, I enjoy their work and would like to see it continue. If $200 is an issue or you don't care about what the Church of Satan does (promotes the work of Satanists and upholds the philosophy of LaVey) then don't join. Joining the Church of Satan doesn't make you more of a Satanist.  




 "Responsibility to the responsible."

 Everyone who knows I'm a Satanist has known me well enough to respect me regardless. Never had an issue.

 Not me personally but I know the Church of Satan can occasionally get letters from deranged people. They have contacts with the FBI and local police agencies and will report any signs of possible violence. See this instance   
http://www.foxnews.com/story/2007/12/15/teen-held-after-e-mailing-satanic-group-threat-to-kill-grandparents/  

Any Satanists that does illegal drugs does so at their own risk and it is *not* something that can be justified by the Satanic philosophy. 

http://churchofsatan.com/faq-drug-abuse.php   

http://churchofsatan.com/policy-on-drug-abuse.php

This should be clear: "This is all quite simple. The Church of Satan does not condone illegal activities. If the use of certain drugs is illegal in your country of residence, they are just that: illegal."

 None at all. http://churchofsatan.com/faq-fundamental-beliefs.php 




 Listening to records, catching up with my watch list on Netflix, enjoying some scotch. 




 No, we pay all taxes and believe all religious organizations should do the same. 




 Green. 




 The only member of the Temple of Set I know left the organization after a short period of time. We would probably not get along as they seem seriously devoted to "the occult" and I have no interest in that. 




 We are own Gods in our own subjective lives. 




 Long lasting memories with great friends. 




 I agreed with much of what he talked about in the 90's and he was an influence on me in my younger years. I've hung out with him a few times and realized that we no longer have much in common. He's no longer interested in Satanism at all and describes himself as a mystical Christian.  




 In literature I personally enjoy Milton's Satan. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_Lost#Satan  

Also see the Lucifer DC comic  
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucifer_(DC_Comics)

I personally recently enjoyed Laird Cregar's portrayal of His Excellency in Heaven Can Wait.  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1HRd8pQn7c  

Here's a list of films with various Satanic themes:  http://churchofsatan.com/sources-film-list.php 




 Satanism is a religion. 




 Godzilla is an excellent symbol for nature exacting revenge upon the humans who took our world for granted and destroy it through pollution, nuclear waste, etc. Satan represents being in balance with nature. Get the connection? 




 1. One can have a religion without believe in supernatural beings. Satanists are not the first do this. See Jainism. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nontheistic_religions#Jainism  

2. We apply the role of the adversary to real world issues and topics.

 LaVey wrote a whole book about this in The Satanic Witch. The biggest thing to take away from it is that there are certain archetypes that generally go well together and this described as the Synthesizer Clock.  
  
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Satanic_Witch  

One of the most important concepts LaVey introduced in The Satanic Witch was the LaVey Synthesizer Clock, an improved form of somatotyping incorporating a fourth basic type to the three already in common use (by addition of the "pure feminine" type, opposite to the "pure masculine" or mesomorphic type). The LaVey Synthesizer Clock postulates that all persons occupy a set body and personality type, placed along varying degrees of the four types proposed ("clock position"), and that ideal friends and lovers will represent the opposite personality/body type by position on the LaVey Synthesizer Clock. 




 http://churchofsatan.com/satanism-and-objectivism.php   


"We do not hold, as do the Objectivists that the universe is benevolent. Satanists view the world as neutral, beyond the concepts of benevolent or treacherous, good or evil. Satanism enables the Satanist to codify his life beyond the ethical and metaphysical straightjacket which Objectivism unfortunately offers." 




 We don't get paid, as there is no job for us to do. Whatever we do in public is our own choice. The CoS is not a charity, but I do not know about their financials other than they pay taxes. What this implies I can't say because I don't know, nor do I care. I think they deserve profit for the time and efforts spent. 




 Thanks!

 Not impressed or interested. They have a stronger political/social agenda that I don't agree with.

 It seems pretty clear to me that it isn't mandatory."If you have employed it..." is a pretty big *if*.  




 Don't put up with assholes in your home. Demand that they leave and if they refuse to leave, make them want to.  There are ways of "destroying" a person that doesn't resort to violence. A destroyed ego can last longer than a bruise. 




 I have read it and agree with much of it, though not all of it. LaVey actually passed copies of Might is Right to early Church of Satan members and only acknowledged that he was influenced by it and used it as source of his texts. I have the copy of it that he wrote the foreword to. 




 Jesu, ISIS, Sunn O))), Boris, Altar of Plagues. 




 The same way humans exist without God. 




 You seem to imply that in order to be a Satanist you have to openly flaunt it, and cause that strife. That's not the case. 




   "do what that thou wilt"
 I have never used that term to represent my ideas. I think you mistake Satanism for Crowley's Thelema. 
 




 1. My Satan is the sovereign individual, the Anarch (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarch_(sovereign_individual)). I've used this archetype in my music and writing. See Milton's Satan http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_Lost#Satan 




 I don't reveal my worldview to uninformed christians, so usually nothing. See this thread otherwise.

 What's driving you to change that part of your personality? Think about it. 




 I just had a hamburger on french bread for dinner, so both? 




 The 8th grade was a great time! Easy homework, hanging out with my friends all day, chasing girls around, and collecting comic books. Hope you had as much fun as I did! 




 Satan always have the best record collection. 




 Because we recognize that at times you can accomplish more with a group of like-minded individuals than by yourself. Being individualistic does not mean you're a loner. Not that there's anything wrong with being a loner if that's what you think works best for you. One can be a Satanist without being a member of the Church of Satan. 




 I've never met a Satanic Priest/Reverend who bought their priesthood and never paid for mine. I've donated more to various podcasts than I have paid for my membership to the Church of Satan. 




 I have never heard of Mike Warnke until today. I don't think he's had any effect at all. 




 I've never encountered any organized philosophy called Luciferianism. 




 I've actually had a more combative experience on /r/atheism than here. 




 I can't speak for her, but I've spent time in their home and I can see that she takes a great deal of pride in promoting and working with other productive members. I'm sure there's a level of frustration having to deal with idiots who miss the point. 




 Delayed gratification is an investment. The very act of going through the effort brings pleasure and satisfaction.

 If by successfully you mean it alleviated a problem I was facing in my life, then yes. Was it purely psychological? I believe so, but I believe that doing the ritual helped overcome the issue to the point that I give it credit. 




 30.  




 I don't, but I'm open to the experience. I spent some time in Gettysburg and there was certainly a chilling element to the atmosphere there, but that could have been just the excitement of being in such an important historical town. 




 I doubt it, but here's one recent Satanic service https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDVyCY6KFqA 




 Not specifically. Because Satanism is individualistic we have a wide range of political applications of the Satanic philosophy. I'm more of a Libertarian, borderline Anarcho-Capitalist, but one of my Satanist associates is a borderline socialist, he was one of the people that introduced me to Peter Gilmore!  

But broadly the Church of Satan does have a couple of political aims which include a secular government and taxation of churches:  http://churchofsatan.com/pentagonal-revisionism.php   




 I'm doing pretty well, thanks! 




 The "taboo" organization has never hindered me in any way and helped me connect with productive people who've improved my live professionally, and personally.  




 I have never "served" the organization. The Church of Satan has promoted my own events, my own art and writing, and in the process I've made some trustworthy friends. When I mentioned doing this AMA, the High Priestess actually said only to do it if I want to and reminded me that I have no obligation, it was never brought up by them. 




 It would be a celebration of carnal love, our shared individual goals, and a more fulfilling life.  




 I prefer Epicureanism over Hedonism. Hedonism is compulsive, we prefer *rational* self-interest.  
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicureanism  
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonism 




 Devil worshippers are usually just deranged Christians, so I just call them Christians. 




 A Satanist can easily see the benefits of workings towards a better society and thus improving their own lives or the lives of their family. 




 There's such a thing as counter productive pride. 




 Being with my wife makes me happy, we have shared goals and interests and motivate each other. She's a fun, positive person who I look forward to spending time with everyday.  




 1. I don't, but I understand some Satanists do. There used to be a store in NYC called the Magickal Childe where Satanists and other pagans exchanged ideas and debated topics.   
2. I can only speak for myself but I'd say 9/10 of the Satanists I've met are purely psychological.  
3. I think it's a waste of time and does not represent me and my philosophy. We don't want any religious monuments on government grounds. See Peter Gilmore on the topic here http://churchofsatan.com/lets-you-and-him-fight.php

 That sounds about right. 




 Satanism is atheism with a set of symbols and worldviews that go beyond just not believing in God.  




  Oculus Whoops! Yes yes, Oculus Rift is what I meant ;)
 




 I record music and do some writing based on the idea of the adversary, the accuser, the sovereign Anarch http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarch_(sovereign_individual)  https://soundcloud.com/anarchaudio 




 Well that wasn't part of our ceremony, but I get it. Would they approve of me if they knew I'm a Satanist? Maybe not. But since then I know a few of her family members got wind of what I'm into and they're still very happy with our relationship, even come to me for help and advice. 




 I actually got a bunch of fun questions over PM and even ran into an old friend. 




 Bride! My fault for answering questions while getting a coffee! 




 I know a couple of Satanist in Europe who met at an orgy in Italy! Not an official Church of Satan event though! 




 http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg23j/i_am_a_priest_in_the_church_of_satan_nevermind/cftgv9c 




 We don't. 




 Just about everyone on the bride side of the family. Edit: Marital dyslexia!    




 Correct. 




 I've yet to be put in that situation, but I know others who used the legal system to destroy the lives of people who did them harm. 




 1. I would think of it as more of a talent. Much like an athletic ability. We do not know how this is harnessed, if at all. Nothing supernatural, nothing spiritual.  
2. Because there's emotional charge in these symbols. I know some Satanists who never use the symbols of Judeo-Christiianity, instead they use norse gods. That drives them, inspires them. 




 It means having a look! Good, bad, attractive, unattractive, whatever serves the purpose. Some people prefer dark and sinister, others personal cleanshaven and professional. If you're an elderly person, maybe take up the look of the wise sage.  




 Since I don't have any faith in external supernatural forces I haven't had such an experience.  




 My mating signal is sitting next to a cute girl and buying her a drink. If she cracks a smile, then I'll go from there. If she turns away, I move on. Some like hard to get, others don't.  




 I don't respond to crazy people. 




 This reddit thread? Hah. Otherwise, I haven't personally experienced that, no. Everyone I've ever told my beliefs to got to know me as a person first and I never had an issue. 




 Never watched it, but the X-Men Animated Series holds a special place in my heart. 




 If it seems pointless to you, then that's fine. I would compare it to secular Judaism. There's are important roles that religion fills in a culture and in your psychology. For other people it's sports, movies, comics, video games, that is their religion. They setup rituals (annual Comic-Con trips), symbols (t-shirts, hats, toys), and it inspires them to accomplish other things in their lives. 




 http://churchofsatan.com/nine-satanic-sins.php  
Stupidity  
Pretentiousness  
Solipsism  
Self-deceit  
Herd Conformity  
Lack of Perspective  
Forgetfulness of Past Orthodoxies  
Counterproductive Pride  
Lack of Aesthetics   




 Sounds like a good idea, maybe someone will do that! 




 The symbol of Satan serves various creative purposes, and stimulates me. Most religious folk get along just fine with me, and vice versa.  




 As you grow up you learn that there are better ways of getting what you need than by crying out loud and shitting your pants. If you have no empathy for others you're likely to lead a lonely, miserable life. I love my family and my friends, and a quick phone call away from them if they need help, because I know I could do the same. Is that shitty? Seems to work for me, with Satanists and non-Satanists.  




 They technically have the right to exist, but they cross the line when they make attempts to interrupt the private lives of others. My wish would be for the government to tax them out of existence.  




 1. I have not, I've heard some that went to anti-WBC protests.  
2. Already answered. No higher powers. See this http://churchofsatan.com/nine-satanic-statements.php   
http://churchofsatan.com/faq-fundamental-beliefs.php  
3. Woolite Black! 




 One a personal level my goal is to have a happy and productive live. As an organization, these are the goals of the Church of Satan:
http://churchofsatan.com/pentagonal-revisionism.php   

1. Stratification  
2. Strict taxation of all churches  
3. No tolerance for religious beliefs secularized and incorporated into law and order issues  
4. Development and production of artificial human companions  
5. The opportunity for anyone to live within a total environment of his or her choice   
 




 A wedding is an important milestone in one's life and we wanted to incorporate our aesthetics and philosophy with it. We modified it because we have good relationships with our families and those of our friends who were attending who know about Satanism got the idea without it being so overt. 




 I have no idea, but you're a fan of blues I recommend checking out Down to the Crossroads! http://9sensepodcast.com/down-to-the-crossroads.php 




 "The name and idea of Jesus/Mohammad has been synonymous with destruction, death, torture, and total depravity for the past 2000 years." 




 That would pretty sweet, actually. 




 I'm a big fan of Wolves in the Throne Room, saw them live with Chelsea Wolfe a few months ago and I own all their records! Just because something is not directly "Satanic" doesn't mean I can't enjoy it for my own reasons. 




 http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/good-guy-lucifer 




 That's a close approximation, sure.  




 People tell me I'm the nicest person they've ever met. That's probably because if they're assholes to me I'd cut them out of my life. 




 It comes from the organization, the Church of Satan. It's a fully functioning, internationally recognized, registered organization. The High Priest and High Priestess review applications for membership, communicate with active members, and decide who best represents the religion in the real world, outside of the organization. What you decide to do with that recognition is up to you. 




 That's it. 




 Pretty much. 




 Let's try this again, at the top. My comments below are getting buried. The whole thing about destroying your enemy if they bother you in public, that's probably challenging, but not because I disagree with it. I have to weight my response with the possible outcomes of my response, and at times this means walking away to resolve in a different way.  




 Well, that doesn't mean you've changed who you are at the core. If your experiences prove you wrong and you need to adjust your outlook, then that's a good thing. That hasn't happened to me, in fact much of my experiences confirm who I am and how I live my life. 




 I believe in the power of symbols and archetypes. I believe in living your life without guilt but also acknowledging my own limitations and flaws. I believe that man's most natural, instinctual state is best represented in the symbol of Satan. I believe there is no afterlife, there is no heaven or hell, and that this is the only life we have. This is the opposite of spiritual religions, who believe this life is in preparation for an afterlife, and thus take the name of the accuser, the opposer. 
 




 I was actually looking forward to this question. I do not have a cable TV subscription, but I watch shows on Netflix. I'm currently catching up on Walking Dead, I loved Breaking Bad, and look forward to getting True Detective on blu-ray.

 It's really not that hard to have a moral high ground on the Catholic Church these days, so I don't have any feelings about that.  




 They know and they're supportive. I'm lucky in this regard. 




 Not me, but I know others who've had their properties vandalized.  




 A wink and good jokes. Never failed. 




 Am I using Satanism for shock value? I don't think I've ever shocked anyone with my Satanism. I think conservative christians are more shocking in today's society. The themes are fun and meant to drive your imagination and serve personal stimulation. I don't go around saying HELLO MY NAME IS RAUL, CITIZEN OF THE INFERNAL EMPIRE!
