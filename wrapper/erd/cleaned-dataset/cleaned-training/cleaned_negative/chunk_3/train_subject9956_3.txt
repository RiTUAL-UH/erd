 "Salvation through" Jesus Christ, living Jesus Christ, the second coming, grace, heaven and hell, rapture and other such things. If you do not take these things literally, what do they mean for you?

I mean, God may or may not exist, but these things sound just wholly unbelievable. 


































 I want them to stay, they are so [BUY SOME APPLES] adorable. 


































 When I press F2 to show the information about selected star system and there are planets with green text, does that mean they are in Goldilock's zone and therefore have better chance of accomodating life? I noticed some correlation between green text and life, but I am just guessing. 




 I have never been particularly good at multiplayer shooter games (and I don't play them often, so I am not very skilled), usually I was in the bottom half of the scoreboard, but I always enjoyed myself. The thing is, it feels a bit embarrasing being told by games how bad I am, which for me leads to frustration (rather than motivation to be better, because I know I will never be a top-scoring player anyway) and loss of interest in the game for me after some time.

What are your feelings about it and about low-scoring players? BTW I am not looking for comfort, so please speak your honest opinion. 



















 I took a contract to explore Tylo, but when I landed I discovered I forgot to add an antenna and can't even make low orbit, so Jeb is stuck there. I tried to send a rescue mission, but it was an utter failure and crashed there.

Do I need to make the rocket bigger to have enough dV to land and come back? Any tips? 












































 I was picking up a gift at a store and noticed they had a porn website open at a free internet kiosk, so I noticed them, lest they get into problems. 















































































 I have known about CloudToButt extension for a while, but it did not occur to me until now to look for a customizable text replacing addon. So I discovered [FoxReplace](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/foxreplace/) and already set some things to be replaced for my amusement while browsing the internet, I'd like some suggestions what to add next, or even complete lists.

 Have I missed anything?:

- Philae bounced twice and travelled some distance, but somehow managed to land again and it is stable, but it is rather unknown if it is on its side or upside down or what

- most instruments work, ESA getting science data

- all means of firmly attaching to the surface failed (that is bad for drilling, isn't it?)

- no panorama photos were released yet

Edit: Lol, it was actually three landings 


































 If something goes wrong and the lander bounces off despite the engine pushing it "down", will its mission be considered entirely unsuccesful? Do they have one shiot only or can they try to push it down again after bouncing off?

 I installed WD Black 1GB yesterday, but neither Windows nor Disk Management can see it. I plugged SATA data cable into the motherboard and I am powering it through [SATA-Molex adapter](https://i4.alza.cz/ImgW.ashx?fd=f3 cd=MK297a i=1.jpg) plugged into a cable that was until now powering only 2 fans. I checked the cables and they seem to be plugged well.

Edit:I forgot to add Troubleshooting tag, sorry.

EDIT2: Issue solved, thanks for help. 





























 By means of natural selection, not invoking higher power. 


































 It is on sale now, but I really don't have any money left, and it has been made available on Linux now. I'd be grateful if someone were so kind and gifted me (of course I'd pay it forward). :-)

[My Steam ID](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197997373039)

The base game would be enough.

EDIT: I just got it from one of my friends. 














 By idle I mean when they sit somewhere and stare at things. Do they asses dangers and look on their environment for changes or what? 




 If you put a small engine on the bottom of a rocket/tank with larger diameter than  that of said engine, then when you attach something to the engine from below it creates fairings, but those have only the engine's diameter.

It can be secured with struts, for sure, but it looks ugly as hell, and having to meddle with Procedural Fairing's interstage fairings is a bother.

Is there any mod which makes it right?

 I have 64-bit Ubuntu and tried to apply this patch, but it does nothing for solving the mk1podCockpit/model problem for me. :( 




 After X hours of building I am exhausted, so I am going to make it simple:

I have to plug the GPU and 2 fans (front and rear) into the PSU.

GPU has connector, which is split in two, each of them looks like this

 I o x x x I

Both fans also have dual connectors, but they are each different:

 I x x x x I

 I o o o o I

"x"s represent pins, "o"s are holes

The PSU is modular, and I have one cable which corresponds to GPU's and fans' connectors. 


From PSU end, it goes like this:

 I o o o o I

 I o o o o I

 ----------------------------

 I o o o o I

 ----------------------------

 I o o o o I

 ----------------------------

 I o o o o I

 ----------------------------

 IooooI    (a small header connector)

How should I plug it all to the PSU? It doesn't seem doable. 














 I bought some new hardware and got a Radeon Silver Reward code. Since I am not in need of any new games at the moment, I decided to give it away here. You can get 2 games this way.

For my amusement, draw a squird (squirrel+bird) drinking Bailey's out of a shoe, the best/most humorous drawing wins the code (I'll PM it to the winner).

EDIT: It is over, /u/saad93 is the winner. 




 I am about to order all components for my first build and I was skimming through my picked parts when I noticed that PSU was 430 V and recommended voltage for GPU was 500 V.

So I searched for a bit and found a similar question here on BaPC where was said that recommended GPU voltages are for the whole system.

I also used a PSU calculator and it showed me that even less voltage is needed (400 V), so that confused me even more.

How do I make sense of it?

Link for picked parts:

http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/2efx5f/build_ready_is_this_good/

If it turns out to be OK, this post might be regarded as Build Ready I guess. 




 I have decided on my first build, but today I remembered that people recommend to install OS on a SSD. The problem is that I do not have enough money at the moment to buy both at once, so I am torn if I should get a SSD first and add HDD later, or go for some SSHD.

I have to decide quick, since I am going to buy all components tommorrow, so if you could recommend me some drive, it would be great.

Here are the parts I have picked.

 Hi, first time builder here, I would like if some of you could check this gaming build out before I buy the parts. Mighty thanks to /r/ltbh , who advised me with picking some different components (okay, he altered like most of them, I am embarrased).

 Hi, I have read the wiki and various guides, and I have already chosen my parts, but it turns out I might not have enough money for this build (and I would like to have some money left):

__________________________________________________________

My budget is maybe 20 000 K (960.20 USD), this build without SSD would cost me 23 741 K (1139.81 USD).

I can add a new screen and SSD later, but it is going to suck until then (my current screen is a tiny 1024x768 one).

I would appreciate your help with rating this build and, if possible, recommending something cheaper. I didn't make this [Build Ready], because I am not entirely sure yet.

Thanks
