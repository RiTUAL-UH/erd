 They are not a representation of biblical Christianity. They are extremists. 




 I do not believe in free will. 




 For the record, I think all of us can agree Sean Hannity is a moron. 

My advice; relax. If you really want to make a difference and spread ideas of liberty, you are going to have to have a ton of ammunition. Keep reading. Read Rothbard, read Hayek, read Hazlitt and even Ron Paul. Forget about what your teachers and classmates think, keep thinking for yourself. 









 I am a Creationist.

I am just not a literal six day creationist.
  
I believe humans do not evolve arbitrarily, but were created by God to obey his law.

Edit; grammar. 




 I only keep books I believe add value to my library. Not every author is Reformed, or even orthodox (I have some of Barth's stuff, Kierkregard, Erasmus etc) but I do not tend to even bother with fluffy stuff. 

 




 I read several books more than once. 

I read *To Kill A Mockingbird* yearly.  




 A stereotype based on Germans historically being seen as regimented and serious. (i.e the Prussians and the Nazi's)

Also a stereotype based on their language, which is perceived as harsh/serious. 




 **For Shaving**

* Mitchell's Wool Fat shaving soap. Smells wonderful, and leaves me without razor bumbs. Creates a very good lather. I use a badger hair shave brush and straight razor. 

* Captain's Choice Bay Rum aftershave.

**In the Shower**

* Lava Soap. It contains grit, so it cleans well. My wife loves the smell, and it is easy to take on the go. I use it as body soap and in my hair.

**On The Counter**

* Brylcreem. This stuff holds my hair combed and parted without making it look gross. A real classic.

* Old Spice Classic Deodorant. I have tried the newfangled and fresh smells, but nothing beats the classic. My wife loves the smell more than anything, which is a great bonus.  




 Just curious, what is in your bathroom?

What hygiene products do you use and why? 




 Will give sources when I get home

The worship of Baal and Moloch included child sacrifices. Many scholars believe the worship of Ishtar included (forcible?) temple prostution. Herodotus includes accounts of temple prostitution in his work. 

As a confessional Presbyterian, I do not believe God has changed his message. I do not see a break between the Old and New Testaments. I see the scriptures as one Covenant of Redemption, with various stages of completion. We are simply in a later stage of the plan. The Law still stands but has different implications for us after Christ than before. It has not lost its validation though.


I can go into more detail in a while, once I have gotteb home, and provide better sources if you would like. 




 God called for the death of these pagans as judgment upon them. He was establishing a Kingdom of Righteousness amongst a people of violence and wickedness. He was violently overthrowing their exploitative wicked religions, in order to plant His people in the land. 

The application to today is that God takes idolatry seriously. Although the actions might not carry the same physical ramifications today, God's atttitude about those actions have not changed. 


We are no longer in a time where our world is run by overtly bloodthirsty pagan taskmasters who offer human sacrifices and sexual slavery to their gods. Imagine living under barbarism like that, would you not support the violent overthrow of such a system? 
 




 I agree. There are true libertarians on both sides.  




 They were created by God. I believe in microevolution, that society and civilization has evolved over the years.

I believe the poor sexual morals of humanity throughout history are a testament to man's fallen nature and mutiny against God's law. 




 What makes you appreciate the perspective? 




 Actually, I hold to an Old Earth creationist view. I believe the world is millions of years old.

Don't make assumptions about my belief system. Christianity is a broad and diverse religion with a ton of nuance. 




 I am totally serious. 




 I believe humans were committed for committed relationships.

I am a Christian, and so obviosuly my worldview is rooted in the Christian narrative. 




 God has given us stewardship of the earth. We are responsible for its welbeing. 
 
Ultimately I do believe he is in control, and will not let his creation be utterly destroyed. This does not negste human responsibility though.  




 Hey y'all. I am about a year out from ets, and I am trying to prepare myself for the transition. I am curious to know how it went for y'all?

1. Did you have a hard time transitioning into a good career?

2. Do you enjoy your career?

3. What things might I struggle with after transition?

4. In what ways has your military experience stuck with you?

I gotta be honest, I am pretty scared of the unknown. Scared about finding a good job, and dealing with it all 




 I am sorry, images are covered in the Westminster Larger Catechism. I accidently directed you to the wrong part of our Church Standards.

It is covered in [questions 109 and 110 of the Westminster Larger Catechism](http://opc.org/lc.html)


We do not ban all images, only images of any person of the Godhead. We ban the use of any images in worship, but as far as art goes we are permitted to make images of animals, nature, humans, etc. 




 I believe the proper and moral place of sex is within a committed relationship.

So yes, I do think visiting prostitutes is shameful. 




 [The Westminster Confession of Faith](http://www.reformed.org/documents/wcf_with_proofs/)
 




 I believe the second commandment is clear. 

My confession condemns any representation of any member of the Godhead. 




 Each a violation of the second commandment. 




 No.

I am married. 




 It is heresy. 




 I agree with you 




 Have you ever considered selling them as mail order brides for ISIS? They look just their type. 




 Sure, 

I grew up in the church, my parents raised me in the faith. I never had a "see Jesus moment", it was a progressive and gradual thing. I began to understand my sin-debt, and at some point it all clicked. Christ arrested my heart, and drew me to himself. It was gradual, over many months, my understanding of salvation. I cannot point you to a definite conversion experience, but rather a gradual understanding of the implications of his sacrifice as my substitute. 




 Historically, I believe Constantine was the beginning of the church losing its way. For a long time I believe the true church existed within the Catholic Church, until barely a remnant remained. There were many quasi-reformers before The Reformers. There was much ebb and flow, but the remnant of orthodoxy was nearly snuffed out leading up to the Reformation.

I believe the Reformation was the great recovery of the true church, and the exodus of the true church from a corrupt institution. 




 First, I would kill a human if put in the right scenario. In fact, I have been put in that scenario on more than one occasion. I am totally comfortable with violence.

Second, no, I do not believe a fetus is committing an act of aggression against the mother. *The fetus is not the initiate*, the act of sex was the initiate. If you want to use your homeless man scenario, pregnancy/abortion would be like me going out and finding a homeless man, bringing him into my home (initiating the act) and then murdering him because he is in my home... The fetus does not choose or initiate the act of pregnancy. Therefore, the fetus could never be the aggresor. If violence is taken against the fetus, the mother is the aggressor because she initiated the entrance of the fetus into her womb, and then killed the fetus for being there.
 




 By all means, ask away.

No, neither. I believe the Trinity is a fundamental doctrine of the faith. By the same token I do not believe modalist thought is orthodox either. These are all heresies condemned explicitly by the ancient church councils.

I (and my denomination) would place Unitarians and Mormons even farther in the unorthodox spectrum than RC's. We believe they are heretics outright. (I am not using that as a slanderous term, just a descriptor to explain that we do not believe these groups to be Christian at all). 




 The key word here is *aggression*. Are you familiar with the Non-Aggression Principle?


If someone is trying to kill me, then any violence on my part is not *aggression*, but *self-defense*. 

If someone breaks into my home, they have commited the act of aggression, both by aggressing against my private property, and presenting reasonable threat to my family's wellbeing.

I am not a pacifist by any means. I am a Non-Aggressionist. There is a colossal difference between the two.  




 Most of Protestantism. Obviously there is a spectrum of orthodoxy. I will not be exhaustive here, but painting with a broad brush, the core issues of orthodoxy in my opinion are the five solas. They must be held to for a church to be considered remotely orthodox in my realm of thought.

As a Reformed Presbyterian I obviously share little common ground with RC's theologically.  




 I believe there are Christians in the Catholic church.

I do not accept the Catholic church as a valid representation of orthodox Christian thought though. 




 Not inconsistent with the Christian faith in the sense that believing it makes you a nonchristian. You can, of course believe Mary was a perpetual virgin and still be saved.


It is totally inconsistent with Reformed Christianity though. Luther and Zwingli believed a lot of things that fall outside the boundaries of Reformed thought. 




 I believe if you create life, you are responsible for that life. No matter the circumstances, once life has been created it should *never* be taken in aggression.

That is the fundamental principle. Aggression. If a fetus is a human, then abortion is aggression. 


If there were, somehow, another way to create human life (cloning for example) I would just as adamantly oppose aggression against that created life.

 




 Just because something is poor taste does not mean it should be illegal.


Most of us who support free speech also think discriminatory jokes are tasteless. I for one do not support magazines or organizations that do such things. 

That does not mean they should not be allowed to do them. 




 Most profitable blue collar trades require some skill traini g first. Do not think you are just going to transition from an office job with no trade skills into a profitable and fullfilling blue collar job easily.

That being said, there are a ton of great opportunities out there for guys willing to learn. Welding, pipefitting, electrical work, plumbing.. all of these jobs can be very profitable. 

My suggestion would be as follows

1. Do not quit your job until you are ready to transition into your new career.

2. Look up labor statistics for your area. Get in contact with local labor unions. Figure out what blue collar jobs are in demand in your area. Sometimes the profitability of a blue collar career can change dramatically from city to city.

3. Once you figure out some options, figure out how to get certified in that trade. Most trade unions have trade school type programs. Votech schools also are a viable option. These things are not always very expensive.

There is a huge market for skilled blue collar labor out there, but do not let your desire for another kind of career drive you to jump ahead of yourself. 




 If the mother does not want a baby, she should not have unprotected sex.

We all know that pregnancy is the natural consequence of unprotected sex. Nobody is confused about what happens. Once you participate in unprotected sex, and a child is concieved, you cannot blaim the child for natural consequence. 

Sex is an act that is by definition, the creation of life. Once you create an individual, you do not have the right tk aggress against that individual.  




 Thank you! 




 Yes, if you are a pregnant woman you own your body. But you do not own the fetus's body. The fetus has every amount of self ownership you do. 




 Last week. I eat bologna on wonder bread often. I take them to work, alternating between bologna on white bread and salami on rye. I am a simple man. 




 Not quite that cut and dry. He introduced the Sanctity of Life Act 2005, 2007, 2009, and 2011which would have defined a fetus as a human being with full rights at the federal level.

He has commented that he believes such matters are best handled at a statr level, but he is adamantly pro-life, supporting pro-life legislation. In 2000 and 2003 he supported a federal ban on partial birth abortions. 

He is a huge voice against abortion, showing no support for an individual's "right" to abortion. He just thinks the matter should be handled on the state level 




 I would say I dress in a way that works for me.

I keep my hair short, and combed. I wear mostly button up shirts and pearl snaps. I always tuck my shirts in. I make sure everything is well ironed. I never wear tennis shoes, typically I wear either my cowboy boots or brown leather wingtips.. I wear a lot of seersucker, cardigans, and bow ties.

My style is mostly affected by the culture I grew up in (deep south) and the military culture I spent most of my young man days in (well ironed, tucked in shirts, combed short hair, etc) 




 No. Because I own my body. That is the fundamental premise of libertarianism. 




 How do you deal with feeling burnt out?.. I am getting real jaded about being in, I am tired of the bullshit, and honestly just do not wanna do it anymore..


I am about 12 months out from ETS, and I do not think I am gonna do it again. How do I adjust my attitude in the meantime? 




 Because those of us who are pro-life libertarians believe a fetus is a human, and therefore abortion violates the non-aggression principle. The moment a fetus is concieved, we believe he has the right to life, like any other human. 




 I am looking for anyone who is or has been involved with prison librarianship.  




 **My 5 Questions:**

1. In what ways have you seen the library program improve prison conditions?

2.  What made you want to work in your prison's library? Tell your story.

3.  How big of a percentage of your prison reads regularly?

4.  What are some things you wish outsiders knew about prison libraries?

5. Tell me any stories/experiences of your prison library enriching or bettering someone's life? 




 Granted, it is not high on my list of important government reform. It would be a future goal, to keep the state totally out of speech laws. 




 First, I am not naive enough to assume that a world of total liberty will be perfect. There will be injustice. But there is injustice now! I believe there would be less injustice if people were more free. 


Libertarianism is not a solution, it is an alternative. An alternative which I believe to be the best alternative with the least amount of oppression. There is no possible way to eliminate all badness in the world. 

I think people have generally done a good job in the past looking to outside sources to make informed consumer decisions. Sure, there are dumb consumers who just buy things for their logo, but there are a lot more people to use information to become a knowledgeable consumer. 




 Fight terrorist morons. 


I also volunteer at my local library.


 




 I think in the absence of such laws, we would see consumer watchdog agencies spring up which can effectually combat such a thing. The business owner who felt slandered could ask the watchdog group look into the matter, the watchdogs would then release info stating that the product was actually quite legal and the owner of the other business was lying. At which point the other business would lose profit because of their dishonesty and dirty marketing. And the slandered business would likeley gain more business.


I still do not see such a scenario as terribly realistic. Businesses are not able to steal tons of business from competitors by spewing ungrounded claims. Such claims are easily researched, and tend to be horrible for business once the truth comes out.

It is not as if we do not have businesses lying about other businesses today. And watchdog groups generally do a pretty good job exposing slanderous claims.


The reason I am against slander/libel laws is because speech is terribly subjective. There is not an objective standard. You could claim any number of things were scandalous. I could be telling the truth about your product, and you cover it up so well that I end up getting sued and lose all credibility while you continue with your harmful product. 




 If I am not on your property, you have no say on my actions. Ideally there would be no public roads, they would be privatozed, and such matters could be settled through the market. You could buy shares in the road you live on, and establish conditions for the use of that road. 




 If I am on your property, you can decide what I say.

If I am on my property, I can say what I want when I want. 

In a truly ancap society, there would be no public property. In our current society, I would advocate for zero regulation of speech on public property. If you do not want me speaking on your private property, ban me from your property  




 My answer would be that it is not the state's responsibility to regulate these things. So no.

If you slander or commit libel, there will arise a counterbalance to your speech. An example of this is the internet. The internet is unregulated generally, and there are many false internet myths, and slanderous statements about people. Organizations like snopes have arisen to prove these myths false. That is how libertarians would like to see society function.

Just because speech is free from government intervention, does not mean it is free from blowback. For examlle, if I owned a theatre, I would likely make it a rule that false claims  of fire or disaster are punishable by a permanent ban from the premises. I do not think the "crying fire in a theatre" example is really valid, because it is so unlikely. Such a thing would never happen. And of someone did yell fire, I do not believe people would go screaming for the door with no proof. 



TL;DR;  we want no regulation of speech at all. 




 As a libertarian, I disagree. I do not believe in any regulation of speech. 


Libertarianism is radical like that. 




 What is not true? I explained ot depends on whose perspective the answer is coming from.

As a libertarian, my answer is totally correct. 




 It refers to being able to say, write, or communicate anything you want without censorship or blowback from the government. It does not mean people have to listen to you, or accept your ideas. Ultimately it depends on whose perspective you are coming from.

As a libertarian I believe all speech should be totay free from government regulation. You should be able to say anything and everything you want, whenever you want, without the government stopping you.  




 1. This American Life -An NPR show hosted by Ira Glass. He explores stories on a variety of subjects. Always interesting, unbiased, and colorful.

2. Invisibilia. The first episode just came out. It is an NPR podcast dealing with invisible things like thoughts, morals, beliefs, and the like. Very interesting.

3. Stuff you should know - basically ELI5 in a podcast format. Dealing with everything from freemasonry to communism to Tesla.

4. Planet Money - NPR podcast exploring stories with an economic backdrop. Way more interesting than your typical business news show though.

5. The Tom Woods Show - Libertarian talk show exploring social and political issues.

6. Otherppl- host Brad Listi chats with various authors, poets, and essayists.

7. Evil Librarians- hosts interview various librarians about their library, their job, literacy, and literacy related issues.

8. The Art of Manliness Podcast- discussing a whole host of mens issues from a traditional perspective.



Those are my go to podcasts. Hope you find something you like. 




 Awesome! That sounds like an incredible place. 




 I thought Finn's apartment was a perfect description of my dream house.

Also, the characters were so alive, and different! 




 What is the atmosphere like?

What is the staff like?

What makes your bookshop unique?

 




 I agree! I dunno why this is getting downvoted so much. I thought it was spectacular! 




 You did not really give an option for libertarians on your spectrum. We do not fit on the traditional right wing/left wing spectrum. We support total social liberty (drug legalization, open borders, marriage equality) but also economic liberty (end of welfare, abolishment of the Fed, totally free markets, no nationalized healthcare etc). 




 I am a sabbatarian Christian. I believe Sunday is the Sabbath, the Lord's Day. All confessional Presbyterians are sabbatarians.

This [essay](http://www.biblebb.com/files/edwards/sabbath.htm) by Jonathen Edwards is a good introduction to why we believe the day has changed to the first day of the week. 









 Grew up a Southern Baptist. After studying scriptures, and tons of reading, the stance that seemed most biblical to me was the confessional Presbyterian stance. I joined the OPC because they are biblically faithful, strictly confessional, firm adherents of the RPW and traditional Reformed thought.

It started when I accepted the Calvinist soteriological position. After that, I came to a covenant paedobaptist stance on baptism. After that, the more minor things fell into place. 









 I am looking for books about expats, especially expats living in Europe. Anywhere from lost generation era expats to modern day expats. 




 They are not necessarily "accepted", but the right to make those jokes is.

I believe all discriminatory jokes are tasteless, but folks should be allowed to make any jokes they want, because free speech is a human right. 




 Looking for any documentary about the Lost Generation expats in France. Especially something that explores the places they spent time at in the modern day. 




 I definitely think Greenwald is the most influential journalist of our time. I wish all of them had his courage. 




 Ira Glass, host of This American Life.

He is pretty unbiased and respectful.  




 American media is absolutely awful. There are very few respectable journalists left. 

Who do you think is the best journalist today? 




 They are not really "special agents". Not like NCIS or the FBI or anything. The enlisted guys mostly spend their time busting soldiers with drugs, or catching soldiers hanging out in prohibited areas.

No CSI shit going on. No secret agent stuff either.

I am sure CID units have barracks. If not, they probably share barracks with other MP's. 




 Yes. Capital punishment is not high on my list of priorities for criminal justice reform.

I think it is right, but first we need to reform the way our system operates. 




 Look for references to the Odyssey.  




 We should fix our system. There should be overwhelming evidence before we put someone to death.

Unfortunately, the U.S. justice system is not one predisposed to fairness. 




 Because we believe the price for killing innocent blood is the forfeiture of your own life.

We also believe fetus's are humans. We believe killing them is murder.  




 ESV. 

I like the folks who translated it.  




 I honestly never think about what other men masturbate to. Ever. Do what you want. 




 Well you have quite an unorthodox understanding of Holy Scripture.

Obviously we cannot discuss this further, because I believe all of scripture is inspired and the absolute Word of God.  




 I believe the words of Paul in scripture are the Word of God (the orthodox explanation of inspiration). I place equal weight behind the words of Paul in scripture and the words of Christ.  




 I almost missed it. It is reay vague 




 And Paul explained quite clearly that all Israel is not Israel. That circumcision is of no avail in Christ. 




 Yeah, she says it near the end. She does not explain it well. 




 I think you misread my comment.


I said I do not believe you have to be Presbyterian to be a member of the Church. 




 I am OPC. We are a lot more old school. 




 No, the promises are for all of Christ's elect. The Chuch, spanning many denominations.


They have no Presbyterian flair, or I would choose it. 




 Because little one, if I explained every answer like you were actually five, it would be condescending (which means answering you like I am much more important than you). You would probably feel a little looked down upon.

Sometimes people use figures of speech to get their point across better. In this subreddit, when someone asks us to explain like they are five, we take it to mean explain in a very simple and easy to understand way.

Does that explain it little one, or do I need to explain it better? 




 A girl coming of age in the 80's. Her uncle (who she has a childish crush on) is gay, and has AIDs, and she struggles to come to terms with what that mea a. 




 I see now, sorry.

 




 What did you think? 

I absolutely loved Finn. I loved every second of it! 




 It is possible, but not likely in my opinion. It is impossible to make a definitive judgement on the issue. His actions were indicative of regret, but not necessarily repentance. Anything is possible though. 




 Again, modern Judaism and OT Judaism are radically different. 

By rejecting the Messiah, Jews are equally as lost as Muslims.  




 Yes, but we *are* Israel. I (along with historic Christianity) believe all of the promises to Israel were for the Church, not ethnic Israel. 




 This.  




 This is true. This was pretty shocking to me when I heard about it. 

As a confessional Presbyterian, we are pretty adament about believing the covenant promises belong to the church. 




 No. Everyone has their thing. As long as I was comfortable with her, committed, and had already created a safe environment between us, I would be ok. 




 Several. My two most notable are;

1. My Grandfather- A welder at a shipyard. Hard working, never complains, gentle and quiet.

2. My old English professor - now semiretired on his sheep ranch. Allowed me to work on his ranch while I was in college and payed me 9 dollars an hour. Taught me hard work, gentleness, patience, and gave me an example to emulate.

 




 Have you seen any wars?

I have. And I would dispute this. 




 Just OP trying to take a political cheap shot through an unrelated sub. 




 I already said we should stick up for all humans in my OP. We should defend and support all himans whether they are Buddist, Jewish, Muslims or anything else.


My point was that it seem some Christians (especially in America) have an elevated regard for Judaism, and a disrespectful attitude towards Muslims. 




 Christianity depends on OT Judaism for its legitimacy, not modern Judaism. There is no theological kinship between modern Judaism and Christianity IMHO. 




 Perhaps.. I have noticed it tends to be the American right wing evangelicals who fit into the mold I described. 




 So war against Palestine (resulting in the deaths of many civilians) is somehow different? 




 Keep your head down. Do not stand out. Do not be an individual.

You will be fine.  




 Especially in light of the Charlie Hebdo tragedy, a ton of Christians I know are showing solidarity with the Jews of France, while saying nothing (or saying derogatory things) about the Muslims of France... 

In my opinion, both religions are equally false. **But from a human standpoint, we should stand against all injustice and demographically oriented oppression.** I agree with neither Muslims or Jews on theological points. Neither religion carries more weight in my book...But many Christians seem to blindly accept all Jews as brothers, and label all Muslims as bloodthirsty heretics..

Anyone else wanna weigh in on this?

(EDIT; Emphasis added, because apparantly my point was not clear.) 




 They were saying if Ralph Nader had been elected 9/11 never would have happened. 

The joke was that the terrorists would have been too busy watching pigs fly to attack on 9/11. (Joke about the improbability of Nader's election).  




 This. If you have a good tobacconist in your area, they would be more than happy to introduce you to the world of tobacco. 




 My favorite artist is Jamey Johnson. 




 His word has resonated in my soul as truth, for one. Nature also declares his glory. I believe faith is a gift from God, therefore I would ultimately answer your question by saying I believe in him because he has enabled me to. 




 Because I believe I deserve the death penalty for my sin, but Christ died as a substitute in my place, and has allowed me to claim his righteousness while claiming my sinfulness. 




 Just tell them thanks for their support. No need to be an asshat about it, let them feel like they are doing something.

I go out of my way to thank teachers and librarians. Shake their hands or bring them thank you cards. Try to thank someone who is a worldchanger. 




 Outstanding. That soldier deserves an ARCOM. 




 They are so two sided. Sure, they will stand with Charlie Hebdo for freedom of speech, while simultaneously putting speech in shackles.

Ah the parodoxy of Statism. 




 As a Christian I will explain the orthodox Christian response.

No one made God. He has always been. He exists outside our concepts of beginning and end. He is seperate from our world and how our world operates. He is without beginning or end. 




 They are not always.

For example, many Haitian-Americans are adamantly opposed to being called African-Americans because doing so trivializes the distinction of their culture. They are not African. 

Basically it comes down to ignorance. We do not put enough thought into the titlea we use for other people, forgetting that titles carry meaning.  




 For one, Paris is a developed peaceful society. Pakistan is by no means a peaceful society. Pakistan is a haven for radicals, so it really is not that surprising when those radicals act like radicals. Mix a whole bunch of corrupt and bloodthirsty extremists into a society, and you are bound to have massacre. Paris is not a haven for radicals. It is surprising when attacks fall on free soil. 




 I really want to join a local bookclub. I do not really have any real life bookish friends. That being said, I have only found one in my area. I had some questions about book club.

1. The book club, as far as I know, is 100 percent female. That is not a problem. I am just curious, would it be kind of awkward for one married man to join a book club full of married ladies?

2. For those of you in book clubs; how has actively participating in the book club enhanced your reading experience?

 




 Ah, I was just curious 




 NTC is no big deal. Not really a factor in whether I would stay in or not. It's not like it's a deployment...

I have gone to either JRTC or NTC every year I have been in.

Also, if you are a 15E why do you have LT flair? 




 Always a bad idea. 




 I think this question is best answered by question one of the Westminster Larger Catechism;

**Q. What is the chief and highest end of man?**
   *A. Man's chief and highest end is to glorify God, and fully to enjoy him forever.*

Our purpose now after sin, is the same as Adam's was before sin. To glorify our Creator and King. 




 I use a poncho. I like the minimalist thing. 




 I do not believe that a noncelibate homosexual lifestyle is ok. No member of my denomination would perform a same sex union.

That being said, I think the state should stay out of it, so I am all for legalizing it. Just because it violates my moral code does not mean others cannot live it. 




 Well, I am a libertarian. I am all for libraries, but do not think they should be funded by the state. They can (and have) been effectively funded privately. 

But I agree about your assessment of our education system. I was unschooled as a kid, kind of a montessori homeschool, and it worked very well for me. I do not think one size fits all education helpa anyone. 




 Yeah, I have a hard time wrestling with a bit of jadedness about the war. I am sure any vet has experienced that stuff. 




 Right now snapchat had been building it's user base. They are about to expand, something called "snapchat discovery", which will feature videos, articles, etc in the same format as the current peer to peer sharing is.

Basically, up to this point they have just been investing to get snapchat big enough and popular enough, that when they do start using it to make money, the user base is big enough. 




 No I have not.

If I did, I am quite sure I would regret it.  




 Duly noted and revised. 




 Exactly. I know a lot of folks who are so conflicted because they haven't "seen" God, or had some kind of experience.

I am just here to say, I have never had an experience. I just believe. Just like I believe Mars exists because of the photographs I have seen. I have never been on Mars. I do not know anyone who has been on Mars, but I believe it to be just as the photographs depict it. I believe God to be true because his word has resonated in my heart as truth (his word is after all a photograph of himself). It does not make sense, it just is.
