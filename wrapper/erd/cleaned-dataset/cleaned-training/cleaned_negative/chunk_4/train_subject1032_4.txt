 Yea, my connection seem to just start dieing after I did that update as well. I was trying to connect to the PSN but I kept receiving an error. After a while I was able to and tried to download Outlast and that's not working Either. Lastly I decided to just watch Netflix but that's also not working for me. I know it's not my Wi-Fi because the phone and laptop connect just fine. 
I'm just gonna leave it off for a couple hours and hopefully I'll be able to play a bit of Outlast tonight. 
I'm in California, some people don't seem to have any trouble connecting online though. Not sure if it has to do with location.

 Very nice! Thanks for posting this! I'm always looking for new artists to listen to.
