 Cliven Bundy has a thing or two he'd like to let you know. 









 And that a right to healthcare is slavery... oh wait 




 Strong Neo-Confederate sympathies are a very common trait among backers of the Paul Family.

 




 No, it was a deliberate word choice on the part of the poster.

He's a right-wing troll who sometimes instead tries to imitate what he thinks "those damn lib'ruls" sound like. 




 Not nearly as good as starting with the "Department of Defense." 




  Rand Paul deserves enormous credit for his actions particularly when you consider he's going against many in his own party

So Rand deserves "enormous credit" for being a member of a Party full of morons? Those are some pretty low standards of which to be proud.

 




 And yet, the Republicans have been getting away with selling ignorance as a virtue since the Reagan years. 




 Sounds like Santorum's ready to work himself into a froth. 




 Until the rent-seekers rape it out of the workers again.

Extortion from captives is neither "freedom" nor "liberty," unless you belong to the permanent leisure class of exploiters.

Americans need to stop voting for the permanent leisure class, and start voting for their own interests.  




 They tried to conceal the snaps where the hairpiece is attached. 




 It's simple, as in "Josh dug her  and her, and her, and her, and her, too!"

Also: rhymes with "bugger." 




 Seriously, though, read *The Jungle.* 




 And not enough Banksters.

 You'd think that Conservatives would be keenly interested in *conservation.*

This leads us to the question: What are Conservatives conserving, exactly? 




 So Jesus wants us all to be wage slaves to the Tyrants of Capital? 




 The social and economic damage that Fundamentalist Evangelical Christianity has inflicted upon America for the past four decades is incalculable.

Will the Reign of Terror and Error of these Censorship Mods ever end? 




 As you can see from the link below, the Censorship Mods just pulled a statement from the President as "Off Topic -- Not US Politics."

http://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/37yy5y/statement_by_the_president_on_the_passing_of_beau/ 




 They killed it!

I think it's because the Censorship Mods must really love "LIBERTY!"^TM 




 This is a statement from the President of the United States, and it's "Off Topic -- Not US Politics"???!?!?

How do you people look in the mirror? 




 And of course, it doesn't hurt that Koch Industries is headquartered in Kansas... 




 Let's see if the Censorship Mods delete a statement from the President as "Not US Politics." 









 Don't forget the right-wing Supreme Court which installed Dubya in the Oval Office.  




 The conservatives of today's era are also Royalists, but this time of Capital. 




 "The Party of Personal Responsibility" 




 TL;DR: "It's the damn liberals' fault!"
 




 The Church has been so hyperfocused/misfocused on pushing right-wing extremism at the expense of the more traditional "Good Works" that they've alienated the last several generations of would-be Catholics. 

Catholics, despite what the American branch of the Church seems to think, just don't want to hear about the evils of abortion and birth control every damn week. If people want to hear that sort of shit, they'd go to some Evangelical Protestant Duggar-esqe "Born-Again" megachurch where all intellect is checked at the door.

This is why children and grandchildren of Catholics just don't go/donate anymore. 




 "We should simply end this illegal program, just like my son should stop assaulting flight attendants and getting into drunken crashes." 




 I think it's because he's so "pro-life." 




 Note also the Right's "Colleges are just liberal indoctrination centers!!1!" meme-lie so popular among the Fox/AM propagandists.  




 Jack Hunter is not racist though.

[Sure about that?](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/07/09/rand-paul-staffer-southern-avenger/2502637/)

Also, what does [this picture of Jack Hunter and his "Southern Avenger" outfit](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/YhKjH9pQno0/hqdefault.jpg) indicate to you? 




 About two years ago a gang of extremist right-wing "Censorship Mods" took over. Anything that these Censorship Mods disagreed with (i.e., showed the American Right for what it truly is) was marked "Not US Politics," "Off Topic" or "Rehosted Content." Many news sources (along with any redditors who dared to disagree with the Censorship Mod's fiats) were often banned summarily.

They even banned "Mother Jones" for a while (for the crime of breaking the "Mitt Romney 47%" story,) but the outcry was so great that they were forced to relent.

Within the last month or so, three of the most offensive and blatant "Censorship Mods" were bounced, as they should have been long ago. Their legacy remains, however.
 




 Right-wingers have a persecution complex. 




  "fighting for our freedom."

Whenever this phrase is uttered, the "Bullshit!" alarm of perceptive students of history and politics goes off.
 




 Given the Paul Family's longstanding affiliations with White Supremacists and Neo-Confederates such as Jack Hunter (the self-dubbed "Southern Avenger" who co-authored a Tea Party book with Rand and thinks that "Lincoln was a Tyrant!!1!" and that John Wilkes Booth was a hero) I tremble to think what kind of Supreme Court Justices that Rand would appoint.

That's reason enough *alone* to completely discount Rand's candidacy. 




 Let's not forget the Paul Family's decades-long ties to White Supremacists and Neo-Confederates, either.

The last thing America needs is a return to the 19th century.

 Wonkette has a good summary of just about every incident in American politics. It's a shame it's banned from this subreddit.
 




 The "forced birth" crowd is losing influence rapidly. 




 Because they're cranks, and their base is mostly made up of stoners who know little/nothing about them.

Don't forget about the White Supremacists and Neo-Confederates that have always followed the Pauls around like puppy dogs.

 I guess now we know what the "Hastert Rule" really means. 




 First, stalk and shoot your victim. Beforehand, trail him slowly in your car for several minutes, then get out and follow him on foot. It helps a LOT if your victim is ... well, you know.

Then, plant some Skittles and Arizona Iced Tea on the body. Whack the back of your head on the pavement so you can claim he attacked you, thus violating the Non-Aggression Principle, and thereby allowing you to act in your full, reasonable, rational self-interest by plugging him one right in the heart. Tell everyone he started it, and that you were only acting in self-defense! After all, you're just the friendly Neighborhood Watch guy.

Not only did you get to live out the "I Thrill-Killed a Violent Thug and Got Away With It!" murder-fantasy, you'll be hailed as a Hero Patriot  and a Genuine Lover of Liberty in no time! 




 How about some life-altering YouTube videos, also? Those always work out great for you guys. 




 And "libertarian 'social' ideals" get thrown right out the fucking window whenever even a dollar is at stake. *Every. Single. Time.*

American libertarianism is a cult of greed. It's the Scientology of politics. 




 Shitebart! 




 No, it's not libertarian. American Libertarians are even further to the right than the Republicans. 




 I relish the idea of watching them all turn blue.
 




 The *extremely* anti-American nature of those who most loudly proclaim themselves to be "***Real*** Americans" is hard to miss. 




 Why doesn't Ted just get an cash advance on the funds he'll acquire in the the "Transfer of Wealth" during the End Times?

 Those poor sister-victims were forced to pray Josh's play away. 




 Women are not brood-mares for the state. I'm sorry this disappoints you.

Which wedge issue will the American Right lose next? 




 If men could get pregnant, abortion would be declared a sacrament.  




 Something is wrong with society when forced breeding is a desirable outcome.

 Elm-tree killing motherfuckers 




  23 hours a day in an 8x8 box with either no window or a slit only a couple inches wide. That's torture.

Do they get the Internet?

 




 But the death penalty isn't as much of a populist rage issue today as it was back in the 1970s-80s.

Much of the success of American Right over the last 50-60 years has been built on exploitation of rage/fear based wedge issues.

They've all but lost on gay marriage now. What will be the next wedge issue they lose? 




 *Tales from Walkerstan* (a Koch Brothers Production) 




 Nice try, Josh Duggar 









 Alinsky's writings proposing the construction of the interstate Wal-Mart tunneling system are well known in leftist circles. 




 I really don't know how any Texas woman (or conscientious Texas man) can vote along with the GOP. 




 That's terrifying. It's a right-wing cult.  




 Hey, another Shitebart story!

Why are they allowed in this subreddit, when Salon, Media Matters, and other genuine, legitimate sources are banned? 




 Only right-wing sycophants will be stupid enough to believe Jeb's lies.

Unfortunately, there are a lot of stupid right-wing sycophants haunting American society today. 




 More from the Duggar Diddler Files.

No one seems to mention the actual victims of this: the sisters that Josh molested. Maybe they were just told to shut up and endure it because "God has a plan"? 




 If anyone is going to be tried as domestic terrorists, it should be the Cliven Bundy Militia.

Also to be charged: the head of the "Oath Keepers," who threatened Sen. John McCain's life recently (though the story was banned both in news and politics.) 




 This would allow Snowden to turn off the lights.

 He should really do a IAMA. 




 Well, if the shoe fits... 




 And in every case of this defense I've heard used by its proponents, the "socially liberal" goes to the chopping block over "fiscally conservative," *every single time.*

Libertarian economics is nothing more that Reaganomics on steroids. Recent decades have proven that these models should be moved ever further away from, not toward. 




 Many White Nationalists, Neo-Confederates, and conspiracy theorists/militia preppers have come to self-identify as Libertarians now.

Ron Paul, Lew Rockwell, and Murray Rothbard began deliberately cultivating an audience of paranoids and bigots in the mid-1980s. Rothbard even named this strategy "Outreach to the Rednecks." 

One product of this strategy was the infamous *Ron Paul Newsletters,* which have continued to haunt Paul and the Libertarian Party. [Ron Paul was the Libertarians' presidential candidate in 1988.]

*Brought to you by ALEC, funded generous grants from the Kochs and their ilk* 




 If you have a job, hen you can be assured that your employer is only paying you about one-third of your worth to him at best. *You* are his profit center.

Here in our America, workers need to get over the idea that has been implanted in their brains: that somehow the noble Job Creators^TM and their financial backers are to be worshipped and trusted and placated at all costs. 

It's disgusting that for mere survival, so many Americans must live in permanent servitude to feed the hunger of the rent-seekers, profit-harvesting financiers, and the permanent leisure class of multigenerational wealth in their united, undying quest to extract and acquire ***MORE*** from us for themselves.

That is neither "Freedom," nor "Liberty." 




 Or in Cliven Bundy's case, to take it outright.

 




  I don't understand the love about raising the minimum wage. I get that it is very low, but I believe the minimum wage should be a starting salary, not something you strive to sit at.

What I don't understand is the opposite: why does the Capital Class feel that they are entitled to next-to-free labor force to exploit? 

*Real* Americans pay their employees a living wage.

 




  Rural people tend to be independent. As such, they don't trust the government... they would rather scrape by than to be dependent on the government.

They sure trust the government when it comes to farm subsidies.
 




 Because Grover Norquist. 




 I hope Ohio's Republicans have budgeted for the results of their new "forced birth" policy.

 Maybe it's God punishing them for being such regressive right-wingers.

Is this statement really any different that Falwell and Robertson blaming 9/11 on gays and abortion?

Yes, it is. Because millions of people *actually believe* the second statement, and their bizarre doctrines are poisoning America. 




 [crickets] 




 Let's not forget that Reaganomics tripled the national debt in only 8 years.

That was a massive amount of stimulus spending, but Republicans will never acknowledge it, as it detracts from their masturbation fantasies : "all gub'mint spendin' is evil!" and "Saint Reagan unleashed the economy by cutting taxes!!1!"

They'll never mention that the Reaganites exploded spending.

Also, before some mouth-breathing right winger says, "but ... but ... Congress spends all the money! It warn't Saint Reagan's fault!!1!," here's a fun fact you'll never hear in the right wing media: in *every* budget the Reagan Administration ever submitted to Congress, more spending was requested than Congress ultimately approved.

Maybe it's time for "the Party of Personal Responsibility" to accept some. 




 I'm sure his fellow inmates will make an exception for good ol' Sheriff Joe.

  I don't think libertarians are that gullible

Are you serious? They fell hard for neo-Conferderate goldbug Ron Paul.

 




 the "ex post fuckto" clause 




 They're the real victims here. All this time they've been instructed to "pray Josh's play away."

Given their indoctrination into the family's radical right-wing perversion of Christianity, they may even have been made to feel that they deserved or invited the abuse, because "God always has a plan." 




 Another point: the Duggars and their apologists can't blame public schools, the mass media, porn, or video games, because they kept their kids strictly sheltered from such corrupting influences. 




 *Can You Feel the Froth Tonight* 




 Also, Josh Duggar destroyed Josh Duggar's record.

I wonder how Josh's sisters are dealing with the legacy of their sexual abuse at the hands of their brother?

Did the Duggar sisters get the help they needed, or did they they just get "pray away Josh's play" counseling? 









 Josh Duggar. And her, and her, and her, and her, and her, too!

I wonder how his sister-victims are coping? No one seems to give them a second thought in this.

 Libertarians don't like anyone, and least of all themselves. 




 "And also my MONEYBOMB! Please give generously, or you hate Liberty." 




 They meet to further divide up the world amongst themselves, yet still lament the stray crumbs from their tables that others must survive upon.

 




 Of course not.  They're 100% American Fundamentalist Evangelical Protestant "Quiverfull" Kool-Aid drinkers.

Fundamentalists like the Duggars are the reason so many roll their eyes today whenever people boast about being "Christian."

The point is that the Catholic Church did itself a great disservice when they allied with the American Religious Right (who view Catholics as heretics who will be cast into the Lake of Fire when the Christian Right's little "End-of-Days" revenge fantasy takes place.) 




  There aren't really many gaps.

Josh begs to differ. 




 Probably more in a Trent Reznor/Nine Inch Nails sense.
