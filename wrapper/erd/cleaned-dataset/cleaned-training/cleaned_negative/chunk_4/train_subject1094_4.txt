 "Before Japans attack on Pearl Harbor, Emperor Hirohito criticized plans to go to war with the United States as 'self-destructive,' and opposed an alliance with Nazi Germany, though he did little to try to stop the war that Japan waged in his name, according to the long-awaited official history of his reign released on Tuesday."

 They found a terrible solution to these protests: http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/05/29/us-brazil-worldcup-security-idINKBN0E91TV20140529

From the article "Police in Brazil's biggest city are seeking to arrest and jail a hard core of violent street protesters before the World Cup starts in two weeks, using wiretaps and other surveillance in an effort to prevent clashes from spoiling the tournament." 




 Right but this is not the case here "But Americans' lean toward conservatism is also steadily dissipating, and that goes for both economic and social issues. In fact, the conservative advantage in both of those areas is as low as it has been (or lower) than at any point since the start of the 21st Century, according to Gallup." He is clearly referring to 2 different issues. A lot of titles in r/politics does that.

 "In other words, the U.S. military was ordering reporters to hold the news for more than 36 hours after the time of the actual surrender. 

The correspondents were disgusted. They were all well accustomed to working within the constraints of censorship during wartime, but this decision seemed different."

 Hi glr123 -

The original title of the article "4 Days, 11 Pounds" was too mundane and confusing. That's why I went with the above title.  




 No problem at all. My apologizes!   




 From the article: "In my opinion, even if the photographs are not the best of the actual conflict, many of them document the vision that the generals and politicians wanted to present of the war  they show resting soldiers who were well-fed, well-housed and well-treated." 




 Thank you, nallen. Thing is, I hesitated before submitting the story due to its writing not only over the top title (and accompanied image). I should have known better. 




 I followed the rules of submitting the exact title or something similar. In this case I submitted the exact title. Thanks for pointing it out.

  If you needed to communicate with the boss, you could reach him via B.B.M., BlackBerrys instant-messaging application. (Guzmn had apparently learned to read and write well enough to communicate in the shorthand of instant messages.) Your message would go not directly to Guzmn, however, but to a trusted lieutenant, who spent his days in Starbucks coffee shops and other locations with public wireless networks.
