 Ahri.... no explanation needed. 




 I tried this for hours...finally managed to get 0:0:0.....only to realize I hit it right on and need to get below that time.  
Most infuriating elixer I ever recieved. 




 7-9 summoning s are pretty sweet. Making sure you get all the hidden ones is key! 









 Sabin is a bit OP early game.
But, with proper esper equipped leveling you can make any and every character OP. 




 You can get an early Genji Glove when you enter The Returners Hideout.
When Banon askes you to be their "last hope" say "no" three times. Before you leave the hideout a random underling will pop up and give you one of the best relics in the game?
