 So I'm genuinely curious. What's the general consensus on these import bans? I'm not seeing anything wrong with the Crimea situation, so I've been against them from the start, but I'd love to get others' opinions. 




 Sure, I knew that, but I don't imagine they're doing any dirty work until they're 18 or so.  




 Well, looks like I've got some reading to do. I agree with you in the functioning of militaries in the modern world, as well. Sadly, armed forces are more often sink pits for surplus population and wealth that could be much better used in much better pursuits. This is not unique to the DPRK. The US does it, most European nations do it. Sure, there's military actions in these states, but it's often to the ends of amoral puppet masters and not to the ends of the national interest. Rather like the DPRK, though in a grander scale and different guise. 




 Absolutely. For example, I'm sure that whoever founded Nestle had no idea they'd become the amoral bastards they are today. I'm sure that the founders of the Republican and Democratic parties had no idea they'd allow America to become what it is today. And I am abundantly certain that the old Bolsheviks came to rue what became of their revolution. Movements can certainly lead quite far from where they're intended to go. 




 I can understand the moral side to this, but from a practical perspective, the North Korean military isn't a fighting force. It's a social institution which rarely wields martial power as it knows that any sort of war they fight is a losing proposition. Instead, it's an internal control mechanism which exists to scare people into line and run camps. I highly doubt that 16 year olds are given rifles and told to shoot people. More likely, they're learning to shoot and parade around and basically nothing more.

Further, the military is likely the best route most North Koreans have for getting regular meals. To say nothing of medical care and possible opportunities for education and social advancement within the wretched *Songbun* system that military service affords. 

So, while I abhor the DPRK regime, letting 16 year olds into the North Korean military is acceptable.  




 Movements have a way of getting away from their founders. 




 Ah, well. Have some upvote. 




 That's the joke. I worried I was too subtle. Such jokes are better said than written, I guess. 




 No, but I'm working on it. (Sfine) 




 I guess there ain't any lips touching theirs then, huh? 




 Kotaku is garbage. Please avoid giving them traffic in the future. 




 I want one... 




 MADD are fucking puritan fascists. 




 Do you smear cream cheese on simians? 




 Is there any canon info on Asari gestation? 




 An emblem of lies for a land of lies. I take it back, that's horrendously offensive. 




 Offended? By Greenland? 




 Or aliens. 




 Direct to door? That sounds amazing. 




 I didn't know that was a thing and love historical cosplays. Next year... 




 Possibly, if they were spaced right. I know that cosplaying in the dead heat of the Georgian summer has made me beg for a winter convention, though. That would be nice. I'm sure I'm not the only one who would love that. But you can't just move Dragoncon to winter. It's a summer fixture. So there's at least two cons right there. Maybe devote one to fantasy and one to scifi?  




 Twenty? Maybe ten. In twenty years, without capping or expansion to mitigate crowding, Dragoncon will have to be split into two or three different cons throughout the year. 




 Hello, fellow Gainesville-ite.  




 My serious answer would be covert assassination and massive electronic assaults on their information infrastructure. 




 So Putin's kin are responsible for something done accidentally by some rebels funded and supplied by people way down the chain of Putin's command? I mean, fuck, they should have trained their AA people better, but I don't think they set out to murder civilians. They thought they shot down a transport carrying some of those guys shelling their cities and killing their people.  




 John Candy esque whining: "Why don't you care, press? Writing that book about how much I hate you men really took a lot out of me. It kiiiiilled me!" *laugh track* 




 There's a Fallout wiki called The Vault. Great for lore stuff. 




 Ah, right. Better to live on your knees than die on your feet, eh? I never bought that notion. A life lived in submission isn't truly worth living. 









 Please speak more truths, brother. Let the slaves of the false god hear your words! 




 "I tried but it just keeps doing that whole 'pile of broken bits' thing. Think I should delete System 32?" 




 This is really good propaganda: simple, direct, difficult to refute. 




 I don't seem to remember it that way. My friends and I all thought the camps were pretty well formed and battle lines drawn at that point. I could be misremembering, but I'm quite sure of it. I will admit that it hadn't become nearly as shitstormmy by then. 




 Labor Day 2014? It was slightly after. I remember wondering if the SJ people were going to flip shit about it and discussing it with friends at the time. 




 Maybe the same race that Guilty Spark encountered in the wreck on Installation 04? 




 He showed up at Dragoncon last year without issue. He was super fun, very genial. Great guy, all around. It hurts to see people dogging him so unfairly for having an opinion. 




 John Candy as Andrea Dworkin would be the greatest movie ever. 




 Utterly tactless. 




 I can't recall. It was Neelix heavy and had some guy who developed a superweapon that was used against the Talaxians. 




 Thanks, hombre. 




 Looked it up, didn't find it. 




 Soviet and Communist memorabilia. I can typically identify which era of Soviet history a specific medal or uniform was manufactured and worn in and the identity of most East German, Chinese, Vietnamese and North Korean decorations. 




 Whelp, we finished Reddit. 




 Well, eventually a conservative faction of real Mandos shows up to bust heads and set shit right, but it still seemed really forced and contrived.

Also, as mentioned, the art style of the show was really bad to me. I would have LOVED it if they had kept the Tartakovsky Clone Wars' style and knocked it out in Flash or something. I don't know why it bothered me so much. 




 Yeah. They were the ruling government on Mandalore. It was awful. 




 Voyager also wholesale ripped off "Duet," possibly my favorite DS9 episode. 




 I'd source this, but I'm on my phone. Check out IBM and Ford's prewar activities, though. They're two companies I know off the top of my head who dealt with Nazi Germany. I can't think of any US companies that were working with Imperial Japan, however. 




 Pacifist Mandalorians fucking ever

Sorry, bud. I disagree for lore breaking examples like that. I also wasn't a fan of the art style. Blech. 




 Never in our lifetime 




 It's not a focus, but they do it better than a lot of other games do.

 I haven't played it yet. I'm just now looking at the IMFDB entry and I've got to say: holy fucking frankengun, Batman! Those are some strange gats. 




 I'm not talking about specific firearms models (and he features plenty of actual firearms in Metal Gear). I'm talking about things like trigger discipline and proper detailing, with adequate consideration given to things like actually fitting a mechanism in the design of a fake gun. You can draw any sort of gun you like, but drawing one with a believable location to hold the thing and put a magazine in it that will have the right amount of room to feed into the chamber and a believably placed trigger mechanism is quite another. 




 Could be bakelite? Maybe some very thick varnish? If it's in Japan, though, it's most assuredly airsoft. 




 The man seems to know guns. He gets a lot of things about them right in his games that others fuck up.  




 The Philippines has a claim on the islands there too. If it was still part of the US, that means the American Navy would be there to enforce those claims.

I agree entirely. However, we could also look for the Communist Chinese to build a much stronger navy. The [PLAN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Liberation_Army_Navy) has, until recently, been something of a red headed step child amongst the Chinese armed forces. Naturally, the Military Commission had been rather keen on the advantages of a true blue water navy for some time, but until very recently the technical expertise and vast resources necessary to create and maintain such a force had eluded them. 

However, in the past twenty years, China's economy has exploded and (coupled with the opening up of former Soviet technical expertise) the Chinese have been able to acquire the backbone of a true blue water fleet. Where once they had been able to field a token submarine force, they're now able to field carriers and light cruisers. 

Now, back to the What If. One imagines that with a US territory not too far off and their Nationalist rivals licking their wounds on Taiwan, Mao might look at a Navy as a much more vital asset. The Communists might even have looked to their friendship with the Soviets in a more careful light and worked harder to placate Khrushchev in an effort to avoid the Sino-Soviet split, thus ensuring that Soviet naval power (which was far from inconsiderable) would come into play in the West Pacific. This is all highly speculative, naturally, but the naval situation alone could pose for scores of HistoryWhatIfs. 




 Underwater, you mean? Andrew Ryan was an incredibly successful businessman topside. In a museum located at Ryan Amusements, the story of the voyage (and subsequent refitting for ocean floor construction) of Ryan's private ocean liner The Olympian is detailed, along with the hard work of Ryan's private army of laborers. These laborers were given places in Rapture for their trouble (and, one assumes, to preserve Rapture's secrecy) but were forced to settle in the maintenance tunnels beneath the Atlantic Express rail lines, now known as Pauper's Drop.

In other words, a lot of the Family Splicers that Delta murdered there are the men who built Rapture. Thanks, Delta. Jackass. 




 That poor rifle. 




 Glad you think so! Thanks! 




 Kroger unionized employee here, making $7.25/hr for 25 hours a week (if I'm lucky) and I'm responsible for a huge share of our positive feedback surveys. I look at moves like this with envy, personally. 




 Rapture employed a system of fog emitting shrouds to keep people from finding the lighthouse which served as its entrance. Of course, during the initial startup phase, there were problems: mass dieoffs of fisheries, oil slicks, and the like. However, as Rapture's defensive systems (torpedoes, mines, inferred anti-air capabilities) resulted in disappearances of shipping and aircraft that remained unexplained to the wider world - coupled with the extremely inhospitable nature of the frigid North Atlantic meant that a large swatch of sea was left quite avoided: cursed to the superstitious and commercially dead to the rational.

As it was never a particularly well travelled region of ocean in the first place, nobody really felt the loss for this and, by design, Andrew Ryan's shining utopia achieved perfect isolation from the outside world... barring the errant daredevil diver or a domestic situation that would make Jerry Springer gasp. Otherwise, Rapture marches on. 




 I imagine it would be a similar situation, but with far more pressure for either independence or statehood given the Philippines' substantially larger population. I'd really like to see how having a large US territory in that region would impact relations between the Communist and Nationalist China. I'm sure Chiang Kai Shek would have been more confident in his position with so many more US Forces swarming around in the Pacific. 









 What are you waiting for, an engraved invitation! Do it now, Samuel! 




 I agree entirely. We've let bigots ruin so many cool things. Let's reclaim them. Fuck prejudice. 




 It's okay. If she does get rid of them, they'll just come back. 




 Yep. ~~Guy~~ Gal who designed it was a Socialist, IIRC. Good on ~~him~~ her, I say. Capitalism is a rotten, rotten system and we need to dispense with it. 




 I didn't downvote you, but your tone was needlessly condescending and I thought I'd point that out. Whatever. 




 Because everyone totally knows what the national symbol of the Ukraine is. 




 This guy gets it. Kudos, solefald. 




 "We're not a stereotype"

Don't leave a tip.

Class act. 




 I'll start you off:

Allons enfants de la Patrie,	


Le jour de gloire est arriv ! 




 This idea's got Moxie, Billy. 




 More like /r/UnusualIdeasAndSubredditSuggestions, amirite? Except for Shifty. The things /u/Shifty_Drifter are doing with this subreddit are commendable and worthy of praise. 




 Do it. Now. Make it the prime time of your life. 




 They'll never ignore you again. 




 Wait, picking it up doesn't... I've been playing this game for years. How did I not know? 




 Read the Thrawn Trilogy. Do it now. Also, Darth Plagueis and the Episode III novelization. 




 Seriously. You're discussing a word, Reddit. It's 'niggers.' You look childish if you dance around it like that. 




 Fuck you. Upvotes away. 




 For real. Whatever happened to courts and pageantry and uniforms for civil officials? Casualism is so boring. 




 This just tells me that nature hates base 10. 




 I've said it before and I'll say it again: the ATF is too powerful and needs to be disestablished, its functions scattered to the winds and its personnel devoted to running a chain of one stop fun stores.  




 While it is very restrictive (not all that unusually so for nations on the Asian continent), it is distinguished by having successfully unified China (for the first time since the downfall of their last dynasty) and having done more for literacy and human development in China than anyone else. For these reasons, the Communist party is not without its supporters.

Not sure why communist is used as though it's a bad thing. Ever read Marx? Communism is, at its heart, a very good and benevolent philosophy - much moreso than capitalism.

Also, the Guomindang are the Nationalist Chinese, the ones currently in exile (for the most part, see: The Revolutionary Committee of the Guomindang) on Taiwan. 




 That's a funny way of spelling Mr Rogers in a Blood-stained Sweater. 




 I'd really like to see something set in a post Lamb Rapture. No idea what they could possibly do, and that's what makes it so exciting. 




 Misogyninjas 




 Ever read about the Guomindang? It got pretty shitty after Chiang Kai Shek took over. 




 Rent is cheap? FREE ON STEAM: CONFIRMED.

Something something metro? ENDLESS SLOGS THROUGH TRAIN TUNNELS: CONFIRMED.

OP has found a goldmine. 




 OP's title is misinformed, if nothing else. Inaccurate, in any case. 




 Except that the majority of Crimeans have no love for the Ukraine and identify as Russian. The majority of Crimeans wanted to either be independent or rejoin Russia before this whole thing happened. The status quo was not all that popular. Only small groups of people sought any sort of tight union with Kiev. 




 He ended it after it was stabbed in the back and the questionably legal [Belavezha Accords](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belavezha_Accords) made continuing the Soviet Union an impossible prospect, yes. Note that the signatories of this pact were traitors acting in their own interests. The majority of citizens in Byelorussia, the Ukraine, Russia and in many other SSRs were actually quite in favor of continuing the Soviet Union. I've no doubt the world would be better off if it were still around. It would have saved everyone a lot of suffering and bloodshed, for sure. 




 Relevance being? Most Tatars today weren't born in Crimea. Their ethnic group may have had a claim to the place at some point, but if most Tatars alive today weren't born in Crimea, it's not really a homeland, I wouldn't imagine. You're attempting to argue from emotion. That's a poor debate tactic. 




 The legality of the Soviet Union's dissolution aside, [Russia's legal continuity from the Soviet Union on the international stage is well established.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succession_of_states#Soviet_Union) 




 Those guys who lost it in a battle and mostly weren't even born there since their ethnic group only started moving back in relatively recently? Nope. It's mostly ethnic Russians that live in Crimea anyway. 




 Crimea was ceded to the Ukraine under peaceful terms when they were part of the same country. As Russia is the sole legal successor to the Soviet Union, an argument could be made that they can take it back. The Tatars are not in the same position. 




 Isn't Fallout supposed to be all about Americana, though? Seems to me like foreign countries would be great for DLC, but that's it. 




 It's not so simple as that. Crimea was Russian. The only reason it was ever ceded was due to Soviet infrastructural convenience. Crimeans never wanted to belong to the Ukraine for the most part. They intervened on behalf of their people because they didn't want the Crimea getting swept up by post Yanukovych, anti-Russia sentiments. You'd act on your people's behalf, too, if Azov Battalion was a factor. 




 Curious: what's wrong with the Crimea situation? The Ukraine was unstable and the majority of Crimeans never wanted to be ruled by Kiev anyway. They were ethnic Russians, by and large, speaking Russians and even holding Russian passports in a lot of cases. I've never spoken to a Crimean who lamented the events. So I have to ask: aside from Kiev losing land, what was the downside of Russia reclaiming Crimea from the Ukraine? 




 Kind of tacky, putting politics on a goodwill message like that. 




 Nothing changes in the Ukraine, I see. All that changes is foreign policy. My thoughts and best wishes go out to the Ukrainians. 




 Free speech, democracy, etc. 




 Georgia? I know we're turning blue, but did anyone actually think these would have a chance? 

(FWIW: I'd never stop voting for a pro gun Dem.) 




 Hunter S Thompson would have thought him adorable. 




 Krokodil Me. 




 Thought so. Words shall not be marked, OP. 




 No one likes SRS 




 Can countries be kicked out of the EU? I don't think they can. They can sure be made to feel unwelcome, however, and voluntarily withdraw. 




 There's a difference between telling someone something they're going to have a tough time after the collapse and telling someone they're just going to die. It's pretty shitty. 




 The lands that Russia is in were never Kiev's to begin with and never wanted to belong to the Ukraine. This is not hard to grasp. 




 Honestly, what would you even call the war in the Ukraine? The west and Kiev can't even seem to agree on the nature of the conflict and Moscow won't admit that it has people in the Ukraine. Then you have Crimea which arguably belonged to Russia anyway and the whole thing just collapses into a semantic clusterfuck.

I'm just going to call it The Great Soviet Tussle and be done with it.

 




 They adopt the tactics of the bigots they claim to loathe and are just as intolerant of "privileged" people as they claim the privileged are of the disabled, women, LGBTs, and minorities. SJWs are a useless, disgusting lot.  




 Do Christians believe that consciousnesses created by Man can get to heaven? What would an AI have to gain by being Christian? This pastor seems to be misunderanding why people would want to believe in a god. 




 Well sure, but speaking as a disabled person, we all know that already and it's needlessly douchy to point it out. 




 Report, downvote and move on.

Edit: What did I say? 




 Are the mods as pro-Ukraine as everybody else seems to be or what? 




 Paraplegic here. I've wondered this as well. Fortunately, my group of friends and I all have a really cohesive plan for a collapse of society and local order and I feel pretty good about that. My advice? Try to do the same if you have friends interested in prepping.  




 I don't know. I'm still not all that convinced. Next you'll be telling me that Leela's a mutant and not an alien. 




 Maaaaybe. I've got a full plate at the moment, but I'll see. 




 Nah. Defect to North Korea. Pays better. 




 They only yell all the time because they love me, too. Discuss? 









 Do it now, waffle boy! 




 For best results OC weapons and sing The Internationale in Korean. 
























 Basically, I have a shitload of obscure music from the Communist world of varying vintages, a level of skill at writing stiffly propagandistic radio copy, and a degree of experience with voice work. What I'd love to do is make a radio station for either FNV or FO3 that broadcasts as a service of the irradiated ghouls shambling around in the old Soviet embassy.

If this sounds like something you'd like to be a part of, let me know. I really only need someone with enough GECK know how to make all the audio that I level and produce to come out fine in the script and in game. As I have no plans to make any in game content, it should be a modest undertaking at its most difficult.

If such a mod already exists, I apologize for the seeming redundancy, but I'd dare to venture that my effort would make a worthy and immersive addition to any play through of either game.

I'm quite pleased with how everything has come together, and I'm pretty sure it even plays nice with canon and lore. I'll make another post once the whole thing is done, and I hope you all enjoy it.

To celebrate this milestone, [here](http://vocaroo.com/i/s1wZJvPoQRxa) is another preview of the DJ copy.
 




 What are North Korean attitudes on the fall of the USSR? I know that the DPRK is no longer technically a Communist state, but is there any sense that they lost an ally or fellow traveler? Do they regard it as a failing in Leninist thought that Juche has rectified? I've always been curious about Northerners feel about the Soviet Union and its fall. 




 Conditions assume that each party has only themselves and their respective skills to rely on. Atlas has his shadowy connections and skill set while Fitzroy is assisted at random and unknowable intervals by the Lutece twins. 









 The booze consumes the molecules you need to stay asleep, so you'll wake up early without fail. Do it! Do it, asshole! 




 I know that information is sparse, but I really wonder how the Soviet Union, Europe, China, Japan and Australia faired the various wars that ultimately consumed the world in and around 2077. Anyone got any hard sources or conjecture? I know Tenpenny claimed to have made it out of England, so we've obviously got something resembling global travel still. 




 It's a crime ridden hellhole. What the hell drives people to live or invest there? 




 Assuming that one would still qualify them as industrial, that is. 
























 Think about it. They've got the poor guy in jail. Their revenge could not be sweeter. 



















 Britain's cockney culture is characterized by a charming accent that is famous the world round for evoking images of chimney sweeps and Dickensian orphans. HOWEVER, there is an untold tragedy behind this distinctive brogue.

You see, the cockney tradition of calling strangers 'guvna' does not, in point of fact, stem from rhyming slang and the archaic term 'scrivener.' In fact, all cockney people suffer from a terrible and debilitating condition that leaves them unable to properly identify the current governor. Therefore, in a mixture of respect and a fear of terrifyingly draconian British laws regarding the failure to pay proper deference to government officials, cockneys are left with but one recourse:

Greet everyone as 'guvna.'
