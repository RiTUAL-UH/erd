 Land Rover: All the looks of a rugged off roader with none of the reliability.

Buick: We reinvented ourselves because our customer base is dying out.
 




 Back when I was in middle school there was a bakery in my town called Get Baked, which means to get high on marijuana. A lot of our parents were not happy about this. 









 I said Craigslist because it is a plain looking website where most transactions, especially sexual ones require meeting a complete stranger, and it has been used by murderers. 




 On here, we often see creepy old fashioned photos, costumes, clowns, dolls, etc. So what from today will be creepy in the future. My guess is that many attempts during the 1990s up until now of creating realistic CGI humans, such as those in movies such as Polar Express or in some video games will be looked at by our grandchildren 50 years from now the way we look at a vintage doll and call or creepy. I also think that the idea that we used craigslist will creep them out somewhat.

 Looks like a CHUD https://nitehawkcinema.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/chud-1.jpg 




 Don't know why you've been downvoted. It might be hard to do because of technical limitations, but I think it would be pretty cool to be able to go between Los Santos and Liberty City. 




 So I guess a title such as "Give me some tips on when it is appropriate and safe to stop, speed up, or keep going at the same pace  at a yellow light" would have triggered better responses. Interesting how two sets of wording can refer to just about the same question and give readers a different idea/feeling to readers. I probably worded it that way due to how much I am concerned about this and want to drive with the lowest risk of an accident. 









 I decided to do a post asking for tips on how to handle yellow lights more safely, I got some good replies, but otherwise it was the largest collection of non-constructive comments and undeserved downvotes I have ever seen on a single post here. 

http://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/2y76cy/any_advice_on_how_to_break_my_habit_of_flooring/ 




 So, this is what I have concluded from the more constructive answers here. I should slow down to stop or keep going at the same pace on yellows, depending on where I am on the road. Yellow means anything but "speed up and try to beat the light". Flooring it once and making it through the yellow isn't dangerous, but doing it repeatedly causes red light running since this is nearly impossible to do every time. Using an icon such as road markings to indicate the "point of no return" is very important. I also think part of why I got so many negative responses has to do with my wording. 














 I wasn't going out of my way to run a red the two times I did, just thought I could make it while it was still yellow because of a lack of experience. We all make mistakes, it's just a matter of how we deal with them and understand the potential repercussions if repeated. I just felt it would help if I admitted here that my driving isn't perfect and needs improvement in the area of choosing to stop or go through the yellow. Just because I did something wrong doesn't make me an idiot. 




  Seriously, if you even have to ask the question, and state you are "trying to quit the habit", you do not belong on the roads and threatening lives.

I have already been doing this less because I realize it is bad and should come to an end, I just decided to ask here to see if there was anything else besides "just don't do it" that would help me. 




 I am really regretting this post. All I wanted was some pointers on how to be a safer driver, but instead I made myself look like an idiot. 




 My problem is with yellow lights. I appreciate that you felt like posting the diagram, but I already know not to run red lights, and do not do so purposefully for obvious reasons. 




  This is like asking "I can't stop licking electrical sockets, how do I stop" and wondering how to fix the problem.

I was thinking this was more comparable to doing something like smoking or nail biting, but I guess you can compare it to anything you want. Despite the fact that I find this an odd comparison, I've found your comments the most constructive so far.

Edit: I know that just not doing it is the solution, but also wanted to see if I should know anything else that would be important to discouraging this. 




 At least I realize that this is a problem which needs to be corrected. Also, neither of the red lights were at major intersections, which I am more careful about, but that still doesn't make it any better.

Edit: I'm getting downvoted for saying this needs to be weeded out of my driving and asking for ways to help besides just "don't do it"? This has to be the the most misunderstood post I have ever written here. 




 I have developed a bad habit of flooring the gas pedal at yellow lights. So far, it has caused me to run a red light twice. It is something I do out of impulse since I want to go through the light before it turns red, but can tell that it isn't exactly a safe thing to do, especially if I end up running the red. I used to sometimes have a problem with hitting the brakes too hard at the yellow lights but stopped doing that because of all the tailgaters on the road. So far I have only had my license for about six months and this is the only thing about my driving that I currently have a major concern about.

Edit: I was asking for advice other than the obvious "just don't do it". I probably also made this sound worse than it really is. Thanks to all of you who made constructive comments. I will keep those in mind. To everyone who decided to be a flat-out jerk, I could care less about rude, pointless comments made by some stranger on the internet. 




 In addition, it would be nice to also see a return of the Virgo and Marbelle, even if the Marbelle is pretty average-ish. I just like that era of cars. 




 Personally I would like the PMP 600 and Faction from IV back, just to name two I can think of right now. 









 Was playing SA and all of the sudden heard this guy say "have you ever done a cat up the ass?" 









  2. Look at cars like a 69 shelby cobra, would you rather own the car that was never crashed or the one that had an accident in '72 and has non-factory original paint?

Would we even necessarily know if there was an accident back in 72' on a pre-Carfax car? 




 I was thinking maybe a 1980s Plymouth Gran Fury since it is of the age the Fury was back then, shares part of its name, and was essentially the successor of the Fury, but something tells me that as a boxy, average looking sedan, it wouldn't seem as creepy. The Monte Carlo would be more intimidating, especially if it were an SS.

 The scrappy doo of cars 














 I asked this same question 2 months ago and got mostly vague responses indicating that it likely happens in negligible numbers, but after re-reading some old Bring a Trailer posts and seeing two federalized Audi RS Avants, one formerly owned by Paul Walker, I have to assume that there must be others out there.

http://bringatrailer.com/2013/06/05/very-youngtimer-federalized-2001-audi-rs4-avant/

 The DHS makes seizing smuggled cars a priority when there should be more focus on seizing smuggled drugs and keeping terrorists out of the county. 




 Okay, I just used that as an example since a gun seems like it would probably be more dangerous than a car if used improperly, not because I am someone who vigorously opposes gun rights or is afraid of the AR-15. 




 The legislator claims that the Obamacare ruling in 2012 made the NMDAA, which forces states where the drinking age is under 21 to forfeit funding unconstitutional. Also, they could prevent the number of drunk 18 year olds on the road from rising significantly if they lowered the drinking age and also toughened drunk driving penalties.  









 The Equus and K900 look like the kind of fictional luxury cars made from an amalgamation of different vehicles that would appear in a video game so the studio doesn't have to pay manufacturers. 




 In my state, New York, which has among the toughest gun laws in the nation, the AR-15 and similar firearms are referred to as assault weapons in legislation that banned them shortly after the Newtown massacre. 




 Two other things are stupid about this,

**1.** Foreign market cars under 25 years old are illegal on the federal level, but in most states, ordinary citizens can legally own deadly assault weapons. Edit: after going through the proper process and obtaining a license.

**2.** The maximum sentence for this is 20 years, many murderers don't even get that much.

 I don't get why hitting brakes to signify that a tailing driver is following too closely is so commonly done. If you brake check and they ignore it or don't pay attention, doesn't this increase the risk of a collision? Why not do something else? 




 Maybe the owners died shortly after buying/leasing them. 









 I wouldn't go that far, Marijuana legalization seemed very unlikely 20-30 years ago. 




 I remember hearing a few years ago that the ruling that Obamacare was unconstitutional because it forces states to comply could potentially set the stage for making the National Minimum Drinking Age Act, which forces states with a drinking age under 21 to forfeit highway funds unconstitutional as well. With this already done, what would it take for the drinking age to have a chance of being lowered, or the NMDAA have a chance of being repealed?
 




 Fuzzy dice 




 The USVI drives on the left, but as a U.S. territory has hardly any RHD cars since they are subject to FMVSS regulations. Therefore, the only RHD cars legal over there are the relatively rare RHD USDM Jeep, Subaru, and Honda mail wagons, and 25 year old cars from the rest of the world. Could 25 year old RHD imports potentially gain popularity as used cars for non-enthusiasts over there due to potential advantages of using them in left side traffic, or would it make little difference to people who drive there. Would the age be a turn-off for buyers? 









 These would seem really cool to me,

- GTA Japan set during the bubble economy.

- GTA Russia set either right after the break up of the Soviet Union or during the 60's-80's height of the Cold War.

- GTA Mexico set during the present-day drug cartel situation.

- GTA set in any grungy 1970's era big American city. 




 Surprised they haven't all been stripped or sent on a ship to the third world by now. 









 Since it is in Michigan, it may have been driven for some time with manufacturer plates, or brought in from Canada. There were plans to sell these in the US, supposedly. There is an e38 730d I have seen around my town for the second time in 6 months, it hasn't been crushed yet, knock on wood. I really don't get why the Feds have to use the energy and money to crush grey market cars instead of auctioning them off on the condition that whoever buys them exports it. 














 Probably wouldn't happen, but I've always liked the idea of a GTA game set outside the USA. Perhaps go back to London like the GTA 2 expansion packs, deport Niko Bellic and set the game in Eastern Europe, or even go for an entirely new setting and character, such as one in China, Japan, or Mexico. 



















 Didn't think of the possibility of fraud. 




  Documents and actual events are two seperate things, so I guess you can change a birthdate as much as you can destroy all records of a person, edit them out of photos, and say they never existed (as in Stalin era Nonpersons). It would be more appropriate to consider reform of certain age related laws. 




 This is why I came up with the 90 day limit. And no, this particular person's parents did not give a fake age and he didn't justify those who did. 




 With their complicated, expensive, components, I don't expect modern-day Mercedes-Benzes to become legendary beaters in the kind of way that the W123 has been for years.  




 Well, on paper the government claims that newer cars can be legalized by a registered importer after undergoing rigorous, expensive testing and modification, but often this isn't possible and when it is barely anyone actually does it because of the price. There was this for sale half a year ago, formerly owned by Paul Walker, http://bringatrailer.com/2014/05/18/federalized-non-usa-2003-audi-rs6-avant/ 




 Good choice, but not legal here until 2019. 




 It would essentially be changing the date when someone is legally treated as a person of a certain age. Now that you say it "changing your birthdate" would just be a more complicated, more extreme form of emancipation. 




 During 90 days little aging or development happens. A former classmate of mine told me that he came to America with no birth certificate because he was born in a country where a war was taking place and newborn babies were being killed in hospitals. He said that his parents remembered his birthdate and had it printed correctly on the birth certificate he received after immigrating. However, he also said that he had heard stories of other foreign born children, including ones from his own country, who came to the US with no birth certificate whose parents made them 1-2 or more years younger than their actual age, usually with the idea that this would give them an advantage in sports.  




 What kind of fraud? 




 Where? 




 "legally do certain things slightly earlier," -  A lot of things.

"or just don't like the date of their birthday" - I'm not one, but it would probably suck to have your birthday on Christmas or 9/11. 

Height can change due to certain medical conditions, and besides just names, people can also change their legal sex and race.
 




 It wouldn't legally be considered a margin of error. 




 I know that your birthdate is the day you were born, but a lot of things are legally one way, but physically another. I would, however, want it to be limited so you can only make yourself 90 days older or 90 days younger, and once every 10 years, so we won't see things like high schoolers making themselves 21. Some people want to get their kids into school earlier, legally do certain things slightly earlier, or just don't like the date of their birthday. I don't see the harm in making oneself slightly younger or older on a piece of paper. This would also be a good way for the government to make some extra money if they charge a fee to do so.

 Thought of this because there is a beat-up mid 80s Buick Regal I have been seeing all the time lately. With it's crooked grill, faded landau top, el cheapo rims, and panels that are all in slightly different shades of maroon, it looks nothing like a car that royalty would drive. 




 Perhaps the 1980s Lincoln Town Cars or Mark VI. The Mark VI has most of the same styling cues of the 70s Lincolns but is downsized like the Town Car. Probably get 18-22 MPG. There is also the 1983-87 Continental sedan which is a mid sized car which should get better MPG and has Lincoln looks. It was also available with a BMW diesel engine, though these are rare. The front drive 1990-93 Chrysler Imperial and New Yorker also have pop up headlights, a big grill, and limousine like feel, but are less substantial looking IMO. 




 Saw the Mustang with "LEFT HAND DRIVE" printed on the back window. I've heard that is a legal requirement for the remaining LHD cars in India. 




 I saw it happen yesterday. This random girl (not a hooker either) got angry and randomly started shooting at cops. Should have taken a screenshot. After she killed the cops, I was able to take the police car without acquiring a wanted level. 









 While playing Grand Theft Auto and garaging, as well as customizing and respraying vehicles stolen off the street, I thought about a story my uncle told me years ago. During the early 90's he had a popular late-model luxury car which was stolen and then recovered two weeks later. It came back waxed, washed, and with new tires, brakes, an oil change, and a full tank of gas. The man who stole it had been using it as if it were his own car. He said that this guy thought he would be able to keep the car longer and get away with it. To do this in real life seems pretty dumb, but I guess it can happen.

 I keep hearing outdated, but doesn't firearm technology rarely change? 




 On one hand, I think it would make sense for the US Army to use the enemy's stuff they have captured for themselves so they can have a larger supply, kind of like police departments using seized vehicles as patrol cars or undercover units. On the other hand, it might be good to destroy them so the enemy has no way to get them back. 




 Hypothetical 



















 After reading this post I did over a month ago, I have decided that there are two possible scenarios for Malaise Era cars.
http://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/2ftkc9/will_malaise_era_cars_ever_increase_in_value_or/

1. Malaise Era cars other than the ones that are currently obvious collectibles will go up in value/popularity in about 10 years as they become more distinctive from modern cars, 70s-80s imports will go up in value, and they will be discovered by a new audience. Today, a Malaise Era car on the road stands out due to its strong differences from modern cars. Some 70s-80s European and Japanese cars are beginning to go for stupid money, while most Malaise Era cars can still be had for dirt cheap. Some may become the lower priced alternatives, if they aren't already. In ten years, the oldest Malaise Era cars will be 50 years old. That is a long enough time for many of these car's faults to not be well remembered anymore, especially by hipsters who crave borrowed nostalgia for decades they never experienced. They already seem to be becoming surprisingly popular among collectors in Europe. I will also note that I read Hemmings Classic Car which regularly runs articles about domestics of this era.

2. Malaise Era cars other than the obvious collectibles are not fondly remembered by most enthusiasts and will fade into obscurity. A few will be collected by a small cult following, but that is it. When they were new, these weren't the cars that kids of the 70's and 80's wanted, they were mostly what the older generations wanted, so the market for these cars is dying out. They also have already had about 20 years to become top dollar collector's items but haven't. It took about 15 years each for people to redevelop a fondness for 40s, 50s, and 60s American cars so there must be some good reason why this hasn't happened yet with the Malaise Era. It will be a buyers market for these cars in about 10 years and most people will look at them at car shows the way they look at old beer cans in an antique store.

Which one is more likely and why? 




 Yes, but perhaps this decreased the number of black W123s in warmer climates over the years because this made them harder to sell and therefore more likely to be sent to the scrapyard, resprayed, or bought solely for their bargain basement price by people who abused them. 














 Usually black is a very common color for Mercedes, but black W123s seem to rarely show up for sale. I have seen more online in avocado green than black and only one ever in person. I would have expected that black would be more popular for these cars since it is a very common color for W116s, W126s, W124s, and W201s. 




 Thanks, I had an image in my mind of 200D drivers spending their entire time using the Autobahn with the gas pedal floored. 




 The Autobahn is speed unrestricted in many parts, and many European market cars have 100 hp or less. Are such cars able to use the Autobahn successfully, would they not be able to keep up, or is there a legal minimum amount of power required to use it? 














 I've heard that most W123s and E30s in Europe are just old clunkers, while they have a large following and higher prices in North America. 









 Mercedes GLC 









 Diplomats are technically allowed to use their immunity to drive non US spec cars on American roads. A few years ago a Lancia Thesis went up for sale in Washington D.C., I believe it was advertised as for diplomat use or export only, http://jalopnik.com/attention-diplomats-a-lancia-thesis-is-for-sale-and-it-1462465134. 









 The Prado is essentially a Lexus GX with a different front clip. Perhaps somebody converted it. 




 I've heard the quality of these is terrible. After doing some research, it is claimed that some begin rusting when still new on the dealer lot. As for how it got here, my guess would be diplomatic immunity or driven across the border from Mexoco, since late-model non US spec cars are nearly totally banned here and there is probably no way it could pass Cali emissions testing. Reminds me of Crazy Vaclav's Place of Automobiles on The Simpsons. 














 Name some examples you would like to see built. 









 I write this because as much as people say Malaise Era cars were terrible, I think there were some high points. There were far fewer high points for the low powered, outdated, drab, "Commie Cars" of questionable quality. I think that if I had been a recent Eastern European immigrant in America when Malaise cars were still current, a midrange 1974-84 domestic such as a Chevy Caprice would feel like a king's car in comparison to Trabants and Ladas. On the other hand, old Eastern Bloc cars today seem to enjoy a larger cult following and higher continued use as daily drivers in their home markets compared to Malaise cars in North America. 




 I have noticed that this seems to be the case among many manufacturers all over the world since at least the 1950s. Sometimes it's the same car available with a variety of spec levels (Mercedes-Benz E-Class, BMW 5 Series, Toyota Crown, Volga), if not, they often share the same platform (Ford Panther, GM B-Body, Holden Commodore/Caprice) 
























 Looks 10 years too late, the only real improvement over the current generation is that the grille no longer reminds me of a 70s Oldsmobile. Better, but would still take an S-Class over it.

 Could be for one particular make, model, era, country or region of origin etc. 














 I have seen many youtube videos and pictures on google images  and some car sites of BMWs and Mercedes-Benzes, usually older though, that have been similarly butchered in places like China or Russia. I guess communism lowers their standards. 




 I'm sure this would seem really cool if you transported it back to the year 2001, but IMHO it is 10,000 times worse than a beat-up 318i with M3 badges.

 Is it economy, development, culture, politics, or physical location? I have heard Japan being referred to as a Western country, despite being located in Asia, while also hearing Cuba being considered Eastern, despite its close proximity to Florida. 




 For example, have you ever been somewhere that seemed like a piece of another country that was brought over somehow, in ways beyond just the language and culture predominant there and perhaps been confused about where you actually were. 









 To think that a car built on an assembly line in Detroit, from a midrange brand, with fit and finish issues when new, and that was a common sight in trailer parks 30 years ago is selling for ultra-luxury exotic money seems ridiculous to me. I could understand $100k, or even, $150k being paid by some old rich dude who really wants it, but $350,000, really? 




 I found this site with a large number of black   white pictures of old American cars in the USSR. Some appear to belong to diplomats or foreign governments, but others I'm not so sure. There seems to be one or more of almost everything from 1950-1979, including Cadillacs, Lincolns, Chevys, Mustangs, Challengers, and even AMCs. I had thought the import of US made cars and other products to the Soviet Union during the Cold War era was banned, and if not, extremely restricted.

 Weren't they built in 1990, next year you will be able to get one imported under the 25 year rule if you are in the US. 














 I regularly read that site, but outside of CC, and also sometimes The Truth About Cars, these types of cars are either ridiculed or ignored as I previously stated. I wait a long time for when Bring a Trailer decides to post a Brougham, which is rarely, and when it does happen, the comment section is overrun by trolls. They would rather see Ladas and black bumpered MGs with Lucas electronics for some reason. When I go between CC and BaT, I am amazed by how much difference there is between the tastes and opinions of the readers. 









 Among other things, I really like Malaise Era American cars, and no not Trans Ams, DeLoreans, and Fox Mustangs, my thing is mainly the Great Brougham Epoch models. Lincoln Continentals, Cadillac Eldorados, big Buicks, Bonnevilles, Caprices, and Chrysler New Yorkers for example. While most on r/cars say that this was a dead zone for American cars, I think of the mid 70s-mid-80s and see a lot of domestics I would gladly own. Style wise, I find the oversized models just as attractive, elegant and intriguing as the earlier 50s and 60's versions. Many of the boxier, downsized versions I believe can be considered among the cleanest, best proportioned cars ever made, right there with the W123 and E30. They may not have been the pinnacle of reliability, efficiency, or engineering, but they have their positives. When I see them on the road today, they stand out from modern traffic with their boxy, sharp edged, un-sporty, un-aerodynamic lines, size, and presence. When I read r/cars or other car sites and see little positive being said when this era of American cars are brought up, I feel like I have the automotive equivalent of a strange fetish. 




 It seems like it in rare to see a late model (96' and up) car that has been made into a true lowrider. Not a stanced car, or bagged one, but one that has been modified with hydraulics and the other common customizations such as pinstriping. Is this because the mostly 50s-80's classics and older models that are popular are particularly suited for these sort of modifications? Are newer cars too hard to modify and work on, or do they just not have the right "style".

 I once saw a 400 mile 2009 MY car at a dealer. The story I was told is that  it was leased by a guy whose health failed shortly after obtaining it. He spent over a year in the hospital, during this time the car stayed parked and he was not allowed to cancel the lease. I'm guessing that his ability to drive was limited afterwards. This is the lowest mileage I've ever seen on a 4 year old car, so what your looking for is probably few and far between. 




 These are rare today. 









 Cuba's vintage cars are banned for export, unless special permission is obtained. There is also no guaranty that an end to the US trade embargo will mean Cuban cars becoming exportable.
