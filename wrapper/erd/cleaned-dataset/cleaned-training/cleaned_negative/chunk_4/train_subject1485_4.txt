 What the hell does retiring or standing down have to do with representing one's constituents in Parliament. Either they're people's MP or they're not. Are you saying they get to stop early becasue they're not after people's vote next time and so don't have to do their job properly? They should be supporting shared parenting becasue it's the right thing to do, not just to get votes.

I suppose you make a fair point about minister's sometimes tending not to sign, though in most cases the sexism accusations still stand for those MPs, particularly Lynne and Lorely (and increasingly so for Jo too). Lynne has a very long history of terrible sexism against men and it's a scandal she's ever been allowed near any equalities position given her obvious contempt for half the population. How often did you actually see her actually do her job and pushed for shared parenting (or for any significant equal rights for men and boys for that matter). I hear that Lorely is quite the sexist too, with Jo now also getting in on the action and actually campaigning against any progress toward equality when it doesn't benefit women: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/9764984/Womens-very-unfair-Christmas-present-car-insurance-price-hike.html 
























 All feedback is appreciated, I'll fix the article so it suits a more global audience. 









 the second paragraph uses the full terminology for "EDM" 




 Bit of a shame really, I expected the Lib Dem women would be more in support of equality than the likes of Labour. 




 Actually it's not all that dumb becasue many other issues elsewhere also see significant rises, for example the number of road deaths in countries such as India is staggering, thus easily dwarfing murder of women.

Any articles debunking lies (and UN lies at that) has to be extremely welcome 














 Thanks for this, i think I may well add it to the article as an explanation for the results. 









 Are there any Firefox or Chrome plug-ins to block Gawker sites? 









 Most are/were complete cunts though and that's the criteria we're looking for here. 




  This is an issue that disproportionately affects men, so it is unsurprising to me that it would attract proportionally more male signatories.

Except we're told that the reason we need female MPs is that they'll all be far less macho, and instead of focusing on big engineering schemes and the military, they'll push for equality and for breaking down gender roles. Thus, were the female MPs to act as we were todl they would, then their support for shared parenting woudl be significantly igher than the support from men.

Furthermore, this is not simply a men's issue. Child are damaged hugely by a lack of relationship with their fathers (both boys and girls), and wrongly exclusing the father from a child's life almost always goes in hand with excluding grandparents, uncles and aunts etc

Anyway, thanks for checking the stats, there seems to have been a rounding error and so 12 looks to be the correct figure. (BTW  60% represents how many extra female MPs would have been needed were the number of male supporters adjusted downwards - i.e. if the 104 figure was fixed) 




 Update, I tweeted some of the various female MPs who failed to sign the EDM and one actually replied! No indication of her changing her mind though unfortunately.

 Exactly. The Lib Dems weren't responsible for Rotherham (nor countless other similar cases) 




 TBH I haven't seen too many sex offenders in UKIP at all. Similarly I've never seen them hanging around with terrorists or planting bombs. Corruption seems to be something of a recurring issue in UKIP to at least the same extent as in Labour.

Ultimately, I think it's fair to say that the types of undesirables seems fairly different between parties. 




 Looks there's actually one Labour MP I'd consider voting for after-all. 














 At HEqual we ran a pretty successful campaign last year against the Boys are Stupid products.

In the end we got more than half of retailers to withdraw the products and most of the biggest UK book distributors also cased stocking the merchandise. Perhaps it's time for phase two now? 




 Danczuk seems to have more common sense and be of more use than all the other Labour MPs combined.

Thanks. 









 A really sickening practice, it's a shame politicians don't dare stand up to this abuse of children. 



















   the fact of the matter is that vast majority of domestic violence is male to female

Utter nonsense, literally hundreds to studies show gender symmetry in terms of perpetration of domestic violence. Yes a lot more males abusers are found in police statistics, but that's simply due to the failure to seek out, report and arrest females perpetrators. When you actually look at more reliable indicators such as crime surveys you find huge numbers of male victims and female perpetrators.

http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.372.5578 rep=rep1 type=pdf

To further emphasise just how false your remark is, just think about all differnet types of domestic violence out there that we ignore. For example there's domestic violence against children, a notable aspect of which is the tendency of mothers to abuse boys much more than girls. also think about homosexual relationship, which many studies note are the most violent of any type. The idea that domestic violence is almost always men abusing women is quite simply a lie. 




 Thanks, a slight correction: I've now found an article that describes it as "domestic violence" but only in the context that it "isn't the first domestic violence incident between the former couple". There is still no source that outright describes this particular incident as domestic violence in itself.
 




 I couldn't find a single article about this issue that used the term "domestic violence" to describe these crimes. Amazing how the media changes it's terminology when it's the male that's the victim, or the female that's the perpetrator. 




 Fantastic video, it's interesting to hear knowledgeable campaigners speak in depth on men's issues. 





























 There are other mirrors of some of the videos 


































 Note the BBC's bias here (and the media generally)

What we have is a set of laws that refuses to protect innocent male babies from dangerous, non-consesnual and irreversible mutilation, with such barbaric practices even funded and supported by the taxpaer! On the other hand, the same laws are  over-protective of females to such an extent that the laws becomes concerned with mere piercings on consenting adults.

It's obvious that males are subject to extreme discrimination by the government, yet the BBC has to pretend it's females are the victims despite the reverse obviously being the case.

 Actually that's not true at all, you can help out from afar in all sorts of ways.

For a start you can share J4M B links and videos, follow them on Twitter and retweet them. Comments on articles about J4M B help too.

Donations from abroad are also permitted just as long as they're not thousands and thousands of pounds.

Feedback is good too, for example you can suggest improvements and submit better academic sources for any weaker parts of the Manifesto.

They don't' even have a Wikipedia article yet either so perhaps someone could help with that also. 




 They aren't seeking to ban abortion, just to change the present limit on the time frame at which abortions are not longer allowed. The main purpose of this seems to be to ensure no viable foetus is ever aborted 



































































































 Here's the second video with the screaming and ranting:

 Anyone know what happened to the false accuser? 














 It's not about me - the point is that a lot of people on Reddit use iPhones etc and therefore won't be very likely to block ads.  This proves we need to avoid linking to sites making money out of misandry and instead need to use archive links. 




 As far as i'm aware it's not link spamming - the problem seems to a lack of IT skills by J4M B staff combined with the total absence of any spare time in the run up to the election. I have passed on comments to Mike and he's promised to get round to fixing it after the election

Anyway i will make a text post soon after getting some more specific details of when people are needed. 




 There's not much on ios 




 J4M B are standing in three constituencies in the Nottingham area. It would be great if these guys could get a semi respectable number of votes and in some cases at least defeat other smaller parties. Details of the constituencies they are contesting and the rival parties are here:

 That's not completely true, for example it's harder to enable adblock on phones and tablets etc, and therefore people might only use it on their computer. 









 Not really fair to insist on highlighting such as chasm, afterall MGM is funded by the taxpayer, so just putting a stop to that waste of money and making the abusers fund the mutilations themsleves would be a start. 









 Actually, I think the filter pre-dates the SPLC nonsense 




 Well 95% of blocked sites were identified through my research, I identified which technology was behind the blocking, and which companies use it. 




 Some more articles I've written on this topic:

http://therightsofman.typepad.co.uk/the_rights_of_man/2013/06/an-email-to-the-symantec-board.html

http://therightsofman.typepad.co.uk/the_rights_of_man/2013/06/o2-and-symantec-equality-for-men-is-more-hateful-than-stormfront.html

http://therightsofman.typepad.co.uk/the_rights_of_man/2013/07/now-fathers4justice-are-censored-and-defamed-by-o2-and-symantec.html


 




 I'm not familiar with Symantec's politics, although I found one person involved to be a feminist (though she was only responsible for defending the sexism and not in charge of the actual filter technology).

It does occasionally block really extreme feminist sites, though generally it does seem that the "hate" classification gets triggered by  the transphobic content on those sites and it generally doesn't appear to be programmed to block  sites containing hate speech directed at men. 




 Would be nice if those rules in the textbook applied to the domestic violence industry in terms of how they refer to victims/perpetrators. 




 I saw that censorship of men's human rights sites was a hot topic right now so best re-post some of my investigative work into the matter. I wrote this article over two years ago but it's all still 100% accurate today becasue nothing has changed, 

I'm probably the foremost expert on the censoring of men's human rights sites by web filters and I've written 5 or 6 articles investigating exactly what's going on and which companies use the filters.

I'll share more of those articles later or others are free to post them. If anyone has any questions on this issue I'll be able to answer most of them fairly easily and accurately.

Some further reading of my research into the matter:

 Hi, I've written more about the blocking of men's human rights sites than probably anyone else out there.

There are actually quite a few school who use the Symantec filtering system. It blocks men's human rights sites as "hate sites" so your school is probably better than a lot of others and at least only censoring instead of also defaming organisations. 

















































 Except the court wishes to see the child's undergo sexual assault and irreversible mutilation, all completely against his will. It's even willing to jail those seeking to protect the innocent child. It' surely advisable to stay well away from institution that uses such threats and supports violence and sex abuse? 




 I disagree. If the father wants to mutilate his kid than that's one thing, the truly abhorrent part here is the court trying to force this mutilation upon the child.

There are plenty of crazy and messed up people out there who want to do evil things to kids, we can't change that to any great extent, but we surely can at least stop the government joining in and taking their side. 



















 Thanks for making this a sticky! 
























 Meanwhile companies such as Symantec block men's human rights sites every single day. A few examples of what they consider to be "hate" sites:

* http://www.dvmen.co.uk
* http://dvmen.org
* http://falserapesociety.blogspot.com 



















 Note that the article actually uses the term "paternity fraud". That's real progress and almost certainly down to the work of our movement and our insistence on using accuracy terminology to describe such a crime. 














  I prefer it. If you aren't and prefer it, good. It's not yours or my business what others do.

In this case the boys clearly doesn't' prefer it, yet this mutilation is being forced upon him by the state against his will and against the will of his mother. Such an outrage is everyone's business and courts shouldn't be ordering the mutilation of kids.

 




 So she went form supporting child abuse to opposing it. Surely people who read the evidence and change their minds after learning the facts and ethics about an issue should be commended for doing the right thing instead of put in prison?

Even ignoring all he above, at the end of the day the child has stated he doesn't' want to be mutilated. It' his penis and if he doesn't' want people chopping bits of it off then it's his choice. 




 perhaps you should be aware that America is about the only developed country to endorse such abuse and that others regard it as so harmful that they are looking at banning it.

As with all things, also be sure to follow the money to figure out how some AAP decisions come about. 




 The Bloodstained Men are a excellent and extremely long running intactivist group who campaign against male genital mutilation in America.

They're great at raising awareness and confronting those performing and endorsing MGM. They're targeting the north-east this year due to it's higher than average rates of MGM (over 70%!) so its' really important to challenge attitudes in such states in order to protect children from this form of abuse.

A few videos of them in action for those who haven't seen them yet:

* [Protest in Denver] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSsdPE4AC0g)
* [Interesting exchange in Tuscaloosa, Alabama] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-PujOfGYZ8)
* [Protest at the AAP convention in San Diego] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGPu4jB_L2g)


They're looking to raise $5K and at the time of making this post they are at $2,140, here's the donation page:

http://www.youcaring.com/nonprofits/help-fund-the-2015-northeast-bloodstained-men-tour/294627

These guys work hard and have even been wrongly arrested while protesting, so they deserve our full support.

Thanks 




 Any supposed benefits of MGM will never outweigh the risks and harm caused. It's obvious that important body parts should never be amputated unless they are diseased or damaged beyond repair.

Butchering kids genitals just for the hell of it and without their consent is sickening child sex abuse. 




 There's a big campaign to tweet about this using the hashtag #SaveChase

It also seems to be a trend to draw said hashtag on your body, and upload the photo of it.

There's also a legal fund set up to fight the case, though note that I haven't fully investigated who's running it etc and exactly how the money is being spent: http://chasesguardians.org/wp/ 



























































 Really generous of someone to spend 1,000 to donate this to J4M B. 









 Laughable article, but it's well worth reading the comments section 





























 I too was suspicious about the likelihood of a genuinely right-wing party proposing such a thing, and it's actually almost completely false to categorise this party as right-wing. It was true at one time, but according to Wikipedia they've shifted over the last decade from being right-wing towards the center:

 "Under the leadership of Jyrki Katainen, chairman from 2004 to 2014, the National Coalition Party shifted from a socially conservative, neoliberal party of the upper class towards a socially liberal, centre-right catch-all party.[8][9] It is now moderately liberal and reformist,[10] and supports, among other things, multiculturalism[11] and same sex marriage.[12"
