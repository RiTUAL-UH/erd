 Great post, /u/NonnyMouse69 -- this is "Baby Step"-like instructions for moving forward! 



















 I will not drink TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; I am keeping Thursday SOBER in my part of SD World!

PS: And who is on-deck to do the morning check-in next week?  Volunteers? 
























 Welcome /u/last_picked to /r/stopdrinking -- I was in the middle of posting a comment to your post when my SO asked to run an errand.  So I like to offer all the newcomers the [Baby Steps link which is apost](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) that lays out some simple next steps to getting sober. These are the things I did.   




 You're really doing it, /u/xXThrowaway71Xx -- that's great news. 




 Welcome /u/legalize_crack to r/stopdrinking--the sidebar FAQ has lots of relevant information.  But to answer your question about how to stop--why not read through [the Baby Steps post and see if any of the ideas there resonate for you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Good luck! 




 You are not alone. 




 I personally was on the road the day I was able to stop drinking for 1 day.  I did it via the things I describe at the [Baby Steps post at this link.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Good luck to you.

 Glad you found us, /u/thenewmeihope.  Have you seen [Baby Steps post, yet?](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Good luck on getting a sober day.  Stay close ; ) 




 Thanks, I thought I had fully scanned for it. 




 Why didn't this doctor's carrier settle this case and seal the record? 






















































 I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; even if I am still cleaning up the mess from the second basement flood in eight days. 




 9 PM 




 This was a huge step for you, congratulations! 




 Sure.  I wake up about 4:30 AM EST without an alarm clock apart from a cat.  After I flip on the light over my bed I take down the 24 hour a day meditation book and I read the day's entry.  I slide out of my bed onto my floor and I spend a few minutes reflecting on the AA 3rd Step and my wishes for family and friends.  I log on to /r/stopdrinking and record my commitment in the daily Check-in or later in the morning depending on what time it gets posted. Then I do a few things around the house and I'm off to coffee and to read the New York Times at a local Starbucks with my pal, "the Dude" where we solve the problems of the world, flirt with the women customers and hob nob with the other regulars.  Every Day.   




 I have to do all the things that are part of my daily sobriety rituals over and over again as a reminder, lest I forget.  There's an amusing insight about people like me: we are slow learners and quick forgetters. ; ) 




 Good luck! 




 1.  I didn't "quit drinking" which implies "forever."  Instead, using the [ideas at the Baby Steps post I stop drinking by making a renewable resolution to not drink TODAY, only no matter what happens good or bad.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)

2. I was in professional and criminal trouble, and I was seriously considering killing myself; 

3.  I needed to extinguish the old reinforcers--friends, bars, clubs, events that fed my need to drink.  I found new reinforcers in recovery, morning rituals as I described in the [Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) and by participation on r/stopdrinking.

Good luck to you. 




 Beautiful.  So glad you shared this.   




 Let's get it going.  I am not going to drink TODAY in solidarity with you. 




 One definition of alcoholism is progressively being unable to control the amount of drinking and actions under the influence of alcohol.  If you're interested in stopping why don't you consider the ideas at the [Baby Steps post?](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Lots of us came to sobriety with doubt and after we spent time sober discovered that we highly valued the new way of life for a variety of reasons including never driving drunk. 




 Congratulations on you new resolve /u/randompete21 -- at this [link is a post called the Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which lays out exactly what I did to stop drinking and to get sober.  I hope that you will find something there that will resonate for you.  Best of luck. 




 Good deal, /u/dirtydan72 -- I hope you continue on the upward path for a good long time.   




 Then don't go. 

When I was new in sobriety I was told and I believed that my number one priority is my sobriety.  That gave me permission NOT to undertake stressful or anxiety provoking adventures.  There will be other Pride events in the future when you're more secure in your sobriety.  Good luck. 




 My advice is very simple: 1. you aren't qualified to run a sober house so don't try; 2. keep alcohol out of your premises; and, 3. go to al anon meetings.  You might also try asking your question at r/alanon.  I don't mean to be unsupportive but the situation sounds untenable in my experience. 

Best of luck with this and thank you for caring so much for an alcoholic to dare to undertake it.  I hope I'm wrong but it does not sound like a good idea for you, your family or your friend. 




 Wow, I am totally pumped for you.  Stay strong my friend.  And please keep updating us as you go along. 




 Good for you, /u/dansusedcars!  Keep doing what you're doing. 
























 Excellent post, /u/Skycakes -- I strongly relate to your experience.   




 Sort of the Rolls Royce of commuter bikes, right there, my friend. 














 Clinton Cash author demolishes HRC according to Rupert Murdoch. 




 Libel is not an issue.  HRC is a public figure and a libel action would be virtually impossible to maintain under existing law--especially in a political context. 



















 Good for you, so keep doing what you're doing and before you know it you will have a week--if you can stay focused on not drinking TODAY.  That's how it works for me. 




 Congratulations on 15 days!  That's great but that brings me to the [least popular advice in early sobriety: dry people, dry places.](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2szkp8/the_least_popular_advice_dry_people_dry_places/)  Obviously, this is your sister's wedding, so you must attend, but what compels you to sit through a drinking reception and all that nonsense beyond an initial appearance and pictures?  

What I did in early sobriety was insure that I was at an AA meeting before and after the event.  That my transportation away from the event wasn't blocked-in, and I WALKED the moment I felt stress or temptation.

Good luck to you and keep us posted. 




 KJ, you have superb taste in music. 




 Welcome /u/SpanglesUK to r/stopdrinking.  At [this link is a post called the Baby Steps that you might find useful](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) of not as a good first place to find some simple "next actions."  The Baby Steps are the things I did to stop drinking and to get sober. 




 Good point! 




 My sponsor is a gentleman I met at one of my first meetings and who was familiar to me as an acquaintance from my professional life.  John G is about 10 years older than me, and I see or talk to him on average once a week.  He's like a big brother.  He's more conservative re: AA than I am, but he's also the primary source of the information that makes up [the Baby Steps.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) I too shared the /r/stopdrinking website with him and he really doesn't get it, but toi be fair he really doesn't understand his cell phone, either--although I told him that lots of info that I communicate originated with him. 

I get SUPPORT and good information from John G about recovery and someone who will pick up the phone when I call.  I couldn't ask for more.  If I need friendship and running buddies I can find that too, although they don't need to be sponsors.  














 Welcome /u/throwawaycuzworried1 to /r/stopdrinking.  At the end of my drinking I was into major gyrations of anxiety and panic attacks.  Stopping drinking and staying stopped was my only hope and ultimately solution.  I was able to stop drinking by doing the [things I describe at the Baby Steps post which you can access at this link.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Good luck to you, you never have to go through this again if you don't pick up the next drink. 





























 I am so proud of you, my friend for all that you have accomplished. 




 I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; and I'm grateful to be wide awake, rested, SOBER in Cleveland but able to click onto access to my brother and sister sobernauts worldwide on r/stopdrinking. 




 That's the historical comparison that comes to my mind.  Instead of red-baiting a la Nixon, we have Union-baiting. 









 Excellent post, /u/yurikovski!  But, my friend, this is far from unusual. Coming to see and value the lifestyle changes in alcohol abstinence is really the point of the push to sobriety.  And the insight that alcohol use is merely a symptom of a larger problem, is classic recovery dictum.  So, here's my cautionary note: an object in motion tends to stay in motion, a drinker who is not making progress often as not falls back into the drinking abyss.  I did after 15 continuous years of sobriety.  

Good luck, my friend. 





























 I'm not sure my comment was snide; but you're mistaken if you think I routinely downvote comments that disagree with me.  In fact I routinely upvote comments that I disagree with that are respectfully expressed.  In fact, I'm going to upvote YOU. 




  Funny how who donates money to a campaign is only a liability when the shooting starts.

I think this is so true.   









 Amen! 




 There's a list on the sidebar FAQ 




 Keep doing what you're doing. 




 Good for you, that's awesome. 




 I wonder how that money is going to be funneled to them now, there's a Super PAC for that!

 Good morning, /u/Nahbro211 --at this [link is a post called the Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which describes how I got sober and which is not a bad place to look over a couple of ideas to start stopping drinking.  Good luck to you. 




 No problem, my bad.  I meant to scan the new posts and I got distracted. 




 I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad.  I'm going to keep SOBER in Sunny and Dry (for the moment) Cleveland, all day.   
























 I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens--in that case I don't have to worry about 4 days in a row, I concern myself with staying SOBER today, only. 




 The [pathophysiological discussion at the Wikipedia link is also very instructive.  ](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Alcoholism)

 That's country music aristocracy, my friend. 




 Yeah, political blowback wouldn't have anything at all to do with the Pastor who uttered this nonsense.  BTW, the librul-rag that published this, Rupert Murdoch's Wall Street Journal. 














 A lot of us thought this way, but as we got a day, a week, a month we extinguished this thinking.  AA meetings helped me a lot with getting new activities, friends and reinforcements to get through these tough days.   









 ; ) 




 I am not drinking TODAY no matter what my alkie brain tells me I want.  Fuck that thinking, I'm not listening to that lying bastard.  No matter what I am going to bed sober tonight. 




 Great post /u/big_mac_heart_attack.  I will say that when I was at 20 days sober I was in no position to judge whether I had lost a social life or not.  I was in no position to make any judgments about what the future held.  I was on an emotional roller coaster and it was going to takes some time before I could fairly assess anything.  I do know this--when I got sober I had to stay in dry places and with dry people to improve my chances of staying abstinent since in my experience and in the experience of my support network bars, clubs, and concerts were too close for comfort to my old reinforcers to my abusive drinking.  I needed new reinforcers which is what I got when I jumped into recovery which for me meant AA meetings and activities.  Good luck to you. 




 First, I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad.  Then I'm going to remind myself that anger and resentment are the chief offenders in relapse scenarios.  Next I'm going to step back and think--just like you're doing, about how my prior nonsense made her feel.  When I've established enough mental space around this, I'm going to suggest that we talk about how I must have made her feel when I did these things to her in the past because of how badly I felt.  Then I'm going to let it go.   







































 Thanks for stepping up this week.   




 I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; I'm keeping it SOBER in beautiful Cleveland and all over SD world. 




 I go to AA meetings by myself usually, and on rare occasions with others.  Your friend sounds like she's reaching out to you to be helpful, but don't misconstrue what she's saying that seems to minimize your "qualifications."  She's merely trying NOT to judge you or proselytize--letting you judge for yourself if I understand your post.  Go, have fun.  Let us know if you think you related. 




 I did not "quit drinking" which implies forever, instead I make a renewable daily decision that I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad and for today only.  I plan to make the same decision tomorrow, but who knows--tomorrow's not here yet. 




 I am so sorry to hear this.  The sober journey is sadly strewn with tragic and sometimes inexplicable losses.  We deal with alcoholism cunning, baffling and powerful.   




 Thank you, very much! 




 Welcome /u/BigDaddy350 to r/stopdrinking--[at this link is a post called the Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/38ohrj/new_here_the_baby_steps_are_a_pretty_good_place/) maybe something there will make some sense for you for starting stopping.  Good luck. 




 Whatever it takes, I am not drinking TODAY.   




 Good job /u/Leafybeans.  I pretty much know that the early days crawl by--we all want 5 years in one day, but it doesn't work out that way.  I can honestly say that at some point you really stop noticing--in fact, but for the badgebot, I would not know.   



















 I made a decision this morning that I am not going to drink TODAY no matter what--consistent with [the Baby Steps;](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/38ohrj/new_here_the_baby_steps_are_a_pretty_good_place/)  I went ot an AA meeting; I communicated with friends in my support network; and, even though I've had a pretty tough and anxious week I am going to bed sober.  If I thought there was any risk that I was going to drink tonight, I'd be in an AA meeting talking about it, but that's how I approach the issue.  I'm not going to throw away my continuous time sober because experience teaches me that no matter how bad I feel about anything if I don't drink it will get better.  This was true for me when I was in prison, this is true for me NOW. 




 Welcome /u/CashinBlack to /r/stopdrinking.  At this [link is the locally famous "baby steps" post](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/38ohrj/new_here_the_baby_steps_are_a_pretty_good_place/) which I offer to newcomers on a regular basis.  I hope something there will resonate for you.  The morning check-in is quickly becoming a base-touching place where members of the community are beginning to see one another regularly.  So I hope you'll use that tool.

Also, I love the Johnny Cash username.  I have some past connections to the Johnny Cash family. 




 I went through this years ago.  In my case it was DTs, albeit mild.  So if you can, please see a licensed medical provider or emergency department.

 I'd love to know who wrote and sent out the talking points.  Roger Ailes? 







































 Recently I've been reading a scholarly work, *A Natural History of Alcoholism, Revisted* by Dr. George Vaillant, a Harvard professor of psychiatry which makes the point about "alcoholism" that academic research supports the view that alcoholism (and by definition alcoholics) deal with a "unitary disorder" or disease.  It is a disorder of some complexity and that alcoholism is NOT a matter of binary diagnosis, e.g. you got it or you don't. Instead alcoholism is often a *matter of degree* a lot like heart disease, or a diabetes.  To call it a disease is to simply underscore that once an individual has lost the capacity consistently to control how much and how often he or she drinks there is a sufficient basis to conclude that they are alcoholic and that treating the conditions makes considerable practical sense.

I don't know if that all comes off as clearly as I can see it--maybe because I'm an old guy and I get this whole heart disease/diabetes metaphor.  I'm a diabetic.  Consistently food of all sorts push my "A1C" as found on daily blood tests into a range that my chronic disease endangers my health: eyesight, heart, and puts me at risk of neuropathies, and amputation loss of extremities.  I can remain healthy and live a full life if I make proper daily decisions about my diet and exercise.  When my diabetes blood-sugar is consistently in the normal range it's easy to think I'm not diabetic, but I am.  I'm not powerless over my disease and in fact I am RESPONSIBLE for self-treatment.

The same with my alcoholism.  I am a real alcoholic, I've proved that to my complete satisfaction.  I am not afraid of the word at all.  I find it empowering.  No physician ever diagnosed me as alcoholic, and despite my several decades of recovery in AA, no one in an AA meeting ever "labeled" me as alcoholic.  I can not consistently control how much or how often I drink, if I drink even one drink.  Recovery via AA has given me a whole new way of life, and it has helped me find a path through the chaos of my life.  Finally, I've been able to put to rest the debating society in my own head about who I am and what I am responsible for.
