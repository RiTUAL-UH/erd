 The options are in the link but:

1 First chemical to prevent the death of brain tissue in a neurodegenerative disease

Scientists at the University of Leicester developed a compound that stopped brain cell death occurring in neurodegenerative diseases in mice. Resulting medicines could be used to treat Alzheimers, Parkinsons, Huntingdons and other diseases, although researchers were keen to stress that more work would be needed to develop a drug that could be taken by patients.

2 An experimental gene therapy treatment cured haemophilia in dogs

Two out of three dogs given an experimental gene therapy treatment for haemophilia remained free of the disease more than two years following treatment. A condition that naturally affects both dogs and around one in every 10,000 men, haemophilia is caused by a genetic defect that researchers targeted using a virus to carry the normal gene. Researchers have applied for permission to carry out a clinical trial in the next two years.

3 Ovarian stimulation developed in mice leads to successful human pregnancy

An ovary stimulation technique originally pioneered in mice has allowed a previously infertile woman to give birth. The ovaries are removed and stimulated to produce eggs in vitro by reducing the activity of the Hippo pathway, which normally prevents overgrowth of the ovarian tissue.

4 Mice can lose their innate fear of cats through parasitic infection

Mice can permanently lose their fear of cats following exposure to the Toxoplasma gondii parasite. Infected mice show no physical symptoms, but did not show an aversion to cat urine, unlike their uninfected counterparts. Toxoplasma can be transferred to humans, and this study raises concerns about the long-term neurological damage that toxoplasma and other bacterial infections might have.

5 Simple molecule prevents mole rats from getting cancer

The naked mole rat appears to be completely immune to cancer, thanks to the excessive quantities of hyaluronic acid produced by their fibroblasts. Hyaluronic acid is a long chain sugar molecule that they suspect may form a tight cage around early-stage tumour cells, preventing pre-cancers from proliferating.

6 Nerve grafts let paralysed rats pee again

A nerve graft applied to a severed spinal cord has restored up to two thirds of bladder function in rats. After six months the rats were still unable to walk, but could urinate unaided. Both the bacterial enzyme and nerve grafts have been successfully used in humans before, meaning that nerve graft treatments for spinal cord injuries might not be a far off possibility.

7 Scientists grow tiny liver in a mouse

Scientists successfully grew tiny liver buds using human stem cells, and transplanted into mice delayed death in individuals with liver failure. They even began to take on a range of liver functions such as protein secretion. After transplantation the liver buds attached themselves to nearby blood vessels and continued to grow.

8 False memory planted in mouses brain

Scientists implanted a false memory in the brains of mice in an experiment that they hope will shed light on the well-documented phenomenon whereby people "remember" events or experiences that have never happened.

9 Dual-action drug shows promise against diabetes

An experimental type II diabetes drug reduced blood sugar levels in humans, monkeys and rodents. The unnamed molecule seems likely to cause fewer side-effects in humans than current medications for the disease. In mouse studies researchers found that long-term treatment at a higher dose lead to significant weight loss; obese mice receiving the highest doses lost 19% of their body weight in just one week.

10 UK firm seeks to market world's first malaria vaccine

GlaxoSmithKline are seeking regulatory approval for the worlds first Malaria vaccine after a successful African trial involving over 15,000 children in seven countries. In children aged 5-17 months the vaccine caused a 46% reduction in the risk of clinical malaria compared to unvaccinated children.

 Do you feel that animals remain an important part of biomedical research? 














 This is more of a condemnation of Fox News than America in general 



















 This is focusing on research involving animals 









 It's research that has come to fruition over a week - but remember this happens every week!

 I'm not disagreeing with evolution - but there is a difference between philosophical and scientific proof. 

Philosophical proof is fundamentally different. The problem is that very little obeys its strict rules for proof - a few examples are: 
- Mathematics - all obeys philosophical rigour to be proof. So 2+2=4 is proven.
- *Cogito Ergo Sum* - I think therefore I am, it is proof for the existence of a thinking thing (most people agree a thinking self)
- Logic - If all swans are black then the next swan I see must be black. If you accept the premise you must accept the conclusion.

The problem with scientific proof is it is open to questions. Near all scientific proof relies on induction:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning 




 http://www.darwinconspiracy.com/

DISCLAIMER: Everything in the above link is bull**** I'm just showing that some crazy people think evolution is a conspiracy. 




 I was half joking, but like most scientific theories, it has a huge body of evidence rather than proof. Of course the theory is true - but by burden of evidence rather than a philosophical proof.

That's the nature of empirical based evidence, rather than, say, mathematical proof.

 How difficult to do? Will it do all the things above? 




 1. I will be plugging this into a TV via HDMI (1080 please)
2. It needs to accept USB connections
3. It should be able to wirelessly connect to my PC and get media from that
4. Must be easy to find specific files from hundreds of films and TV series. 
5. Must play many formats
6. Must be available in the UK
7. An easy interface please
8. BBC iplayer would be a boost, and youtube

Considering Boxee Box and WD Media Streamer at the moment 














 Sure!

 As a teacher I would be very concerned about my child not going to university. It doesn't prevent them being a success, but it does close doors that would remain open if they did a degree (many jobs are for graduates only). 

I suppose if they had a very clear alternative plan then I would accept it, and I might urge them to take a gap year beforehand, but I do think that I would push them to applying to university (they don't have to accept the place). 




 Imagine you have an 18 year old child. They said they didn't really want to apply to university. Would you accept their decision, or would you badger them into applying?

 Rights vs Welfare has been a real challenge in many cases. I think effecting public change is the real case. 














 Considering drums tend to support a band, the time signature bottom end does matter.

Sting - Seven Days = 5/8
Dave Brubeck - Take Five = 5/4 














 I didn't offer any objection - its the original title.  














 So put the praise chart near the door and give people ticks as they start to do the starter - others should catch on quickly 




 Positive praise charts - they work for all ages but you have to persist for a few weeks.

Everyone's name down one side, a tick for everything good (might be sitting down and starting the starting activity quietly - might be good homework etc.) Give lots of ticks and praise loudly. 
5 ticks = positive postcard home to parents
10 ticks = positive phonecall home to parents

Be warned - they will pretend not to care at first. This does not mean they don't care.

Other aspects to look at is how you start your class - are you standing by the door greeting them. Is there a starting activity they can get on with before everyone has arrived? If they are roudy as they come in, don't let them enter - they need to wait until they are calm and quiet before coming in. 














 Try a positive praise chart. Those who remain quiet, or make big improvements in their quietness are publicly praised and get a tick. When they get 5 ticks they get a postcard home. When they get 10 ticks they get a phonecall home. etc. 




 Having been a maths teacher I wouldn't have approved of that method. It's messy and teaches poor core maths understanding.

 I would definitely look into the 16-17" A or A custom medium or projection crashes. I find the A series probably the most versatile of Zildjian's ranges.

 Not a particularly light hitter. For the last coupole of years it's not been used much, but if you went back 4-5 years it was in use every day.
