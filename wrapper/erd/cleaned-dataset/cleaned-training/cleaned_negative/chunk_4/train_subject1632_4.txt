 Kava is definitely one; at comparable levels of intoxication, it's probably safer than alcohol.

Same for marijuana (no combustion) if you don't mind having shit memory.

Nicotine is probably fine as well (no combustion, no funky e-juice) if you can successfully avoid risk factors for heart disease.

Same for caffeine and most other stimulants (including amphetamines) - it's fine if you aren't at risk for heart disease and keep the dose reasonable.

Opiates are generally safe if you have a clean source, don't combine with stimulants or alcohol, can keep the dose reasonable, and you do something to counteract the chronic constipation.

All the classical psychedelics are ok too, though tolerance will prevent use more than once every 3 days, and chronic use in combination with stimulants could wreck your circulatory system over time.

Novel psychedelics (research chemicals like the nbomes) are a big question mark for safety.

Coca tea can be consumed daily with no ill effect, in large enough doses to have a stimulant effect comparable to coffee, if you aren't at risk for heart disease.

MDMA is out.  Can't be used safely more than once every week or two.

Etc.  Most drugs are fine if you can keep the dose reasonable, avoid nasty combinations, and aren't at risk for heart disease.  One of the main reasons people can't sustain drug habits is because of interference with daily life, or because dependence and tolerance lead to unsustainable high dose habits. 




 Do you have a reference for that? 




 It's a false dichotomy; the two categories are not mutually exclusive. 




 The prevailing wisdom is that one should hold it under one's tongue for a few minutes, then swallow it.  This way, it really doesn't matter which one is more potent.

One common cause of failed attempts with tryptamine psychedelics like LSD is interaction with psychiatric medications, such as an SSRI.  It's also true that people vary in their dose response to psychedelics; perhaps you require a higher dose, just because you're you. 




 I realised that life doesnt need to have a meaning and we are just naturally curious about our existence does anyone feel that way when they drop acid

I feel that way often, if I understand you correctly.  Meaning is a human activity, a part of this evolved system of subjective experience and interaction with whatever unknowable reality there is beyond it.  Meaningness seems to be a habit of human beings, not something inherent in some substance beyond our subjectivity. 




 Yeah...but it's small consolation, because everybody thinks you're out of your fucking mind health food crazy if you ask the questions you need to ask as a celiac to eat safely in a restaurant (e.g. can you have the prep cook change gloves).  It was easier when nobody knew what gluten was - then we could just explain ourselves as a novel food allergy.  Now that it's a pop culture thing, it's just embarrassing to be associated with.

(I had celiac before it was cool) 




 That's quite a collection.

Just use [ULTRAHANGOVER 6000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) - it has them all! 




 Stop smoking immediately.  No other change is necessary until shortly before the test.

Two days before the test, start drinking an extra half-gallon of water per day.  Do it the day of the test as well.

At the same time, begin taking a high dose B vitamin supplement and normal dose creatine supplement.  Take these supplements each day leading up, and also an hour or two before the test.  Drink a few extra glasses of water in the hours leading up to the test.

This method works quite well, and can be found in many mild variations all over the internet.  This is how it works:

By not using marijuana, your levels of THC metabolites will naturally fall.  A regular smoker should leave at least a couple weeks of abstinence before a drug test.

By drinking extra water before the test, you ensure that your urine is dilute.  By taking B-vitamins in high dose, you ensure that your urine is still yellow.  By taking creatine, you ensure that your urine levels of creatinine (a metabolite of creatine that is sometimes tested for to check for diluation) are normal.

Neither the supplements nor the water do anything to eliminate THC metabolites from your body; drinking extra water will do nothing but dilute your urine, and so is not necessary until the test is imminent.  The supplements are only there to end up in your urine to make it appear undilute.

Best of luck.  You should be able to pass using this method alone.  The few weeks of abstinence are important for it to succeed - you can only dilute so much. 




 The time required will probably vary by substance.  5 minutes is probably sufficient if the supplement is known to absorb sublingually in appreciable amounts. 




 Drink plenty of water prior to and during your alcohol infused evening. 




 Hmm.  Think about it, though - if plant growth is not influenced by sound, how can you explain the results of the two good studies cited in that article?  Why assume that there is no relationship when you have good evidence that there is? 




 Sure, sure - establishing mechanisms is a very important part of physiology.  I just don't believe it's appropriate to maintain extreme skepticism of the results of well designed experiments that don't establish a mechanism, but do establish causality.

At that point, it seems the burden of proof is on whoever wishes to dispute the finding. 




  I'll remain highly skeptical of this until I hear a plausible mechanism

Why?  A well designed experiment could ([and apparently has](http://news.psu.edu/story/141343/2008/08/25/research/probing-question-does-talking-plants-help-them-grow)) already established the effect.  A plausible mechanism is not necessary in any way. 




 Unless you have a reason to suspect deficiency (e.g. you're a vegetarian), you probably shouldn't supplement it alone.  Too much zinc can inhibit absorption of copper.  It is probably better to take a multivitamin or multimineral supplement that contains both in similar quantities, if you really want to supplement.

Supplements are heavily marketed by companies who have a solution they need to sell you.  It's difficult to sell solutions to people who don't have problems, so a lot of material out there is designed to make you think you have a problem that supplement X will solve.

In reality, most supplements in most situations are unnecessary at best. 




 No need for a necklace if you get the timing and depth right, but you should really be asking /r/opiates .  Plenty of info online about how to do it right.

Or you could just harvest and dry for making tea.  Include the stalks. 




 Poppy tea has identical effects to extracted opium if both are consumed as a liquid beverage at comparable doses. 




 Are you *certain* that you're not a white man?  This is all very disconcerting... 




 Haha!  All a matter of perspective, isn't it?  This is an odd moment for the field of mental health; psychedelic drug use of any kind is defined as abuse, yet psychedelic drugs are being actively researched as interventions for mental illness. 




 So many comments assume that OP is a man... :/ 




 Taking a COX2 inhibitor (e.g. NSAIDs like ibuprofen, natural anti-inflammatories like ginger and turmeric) can reduce or entirely block the negative effects of THC on memory.

 **SHUT THE FUCK UP AND GET A LAWYER**

**public defender is ok**

p.s.  No animosity is intended.  But you really do need to keep your mouth shut, anything you say to anybody who isn't your lawyer is likely hurt you in court.  You shouldn't even deny anything, just stop offering free information to the prosecution.  You should try to get your folks to stop talking to anybody about this to. 




 It's fairly common for practicing therapists with a terminal master's degree to have personal experience with what, in that field, are known as "drugs of abuse." 




 I think it is a better term than African American / Hispanic, because in truth the police are aggressive toward African Americans, Hispanics, Indians, Native Americans, Middle Easterners, and so on in very similar fashion.  It seems like they really do target people by the color of their skin, and not by specific ethnicity. 




 The only time I've felt LSD come on anywhere near that fast was one obscenely large dose that started coming on around 15 minutes in.  I think it's safe to say that if you're sober enough to post on reddit 6 hours later, you have no concerns. 




 Beautiful..

Would you explain your technique for us?  It sounds like there are a couple of layers, one of which is a looped clip or delay pedal - but perhaps this is an illusion, and there is only one layer, and this goes through a delay.  How did you make this? 




 I would debunk this for you, but I'm afraid you're just too young to understand.  




 I really enjoyed the vibe and sound of the first track.  I like that you're doing this with piano and a bare, relatively untouched sound.

I'd be curious to hear how this set sounded if instead developing thoughts by adding melody, you developed the harmony, voicings, and texture.  To me, there was far to much melodic and rhythmic content for it to sound very drone. 




 That isn't true at all.  You can't use 1040EZ unless your income is extremely straightforward.  You can't use it with dependents.  You can't use it with self-employment income - even if it is quite small (e.g. a one-off contracting gig). 

There's no way 9/10 taxpayers are using that form. 




 Not in my experience.  Just about every daily user I've known had obvious, substantial cognitive impairment until they quit (if they quit).

edit:  Speaking only of typical recreational use, not high CBD/low THC strains or carefully managed edibles. 




 The distinction between physical and psychological addiction is misleading and fairly unimportant.  Marijuana can produce profound addiction, complete with a physically manifested withdrawal and severe cravings that last for weeks, which is mediated by an imbalance of neurotransmitters in the brain due to adaptation that occurred in response to regular use. 




 Indicas and sativas have similar levels of CBD, though.  CBD is not what gives indicas their uniquely stoning quality.

High cbd strains come in a wide range of THC:CBD ratios.  Some are actually quite intoxicating, but don't wipe your memory so severely.  Others are extremely mild and seem to have little or no effect on memory. 




 This seems to be true in my experience as well, and it makes sense; CBD is a CB1 antagonist, and the hippocampal neurotoxicity of THC is mediated by CB1 agonist.  This is actually a central finding of one of the studies quoted above. 




 Hey, they jive reasonably well with what I've seen of cannabis in my life.  Most people I've known to be regular herb smokers are pretty fucking dumb, myself included, until they've been off it or mostly off it for a few months.

But it wasn't until I'd actually stopped for a few months that I could see the difference and believe it. 




 I've posted info from some of the same studies there and in /r/drugs before, and found that people were not interested in hearing it and didn't believe it. 




  These data indicate that THC toxicity is mediated through CB1 receptors and not caused by nonspecific interactions with the membrane lipid phase... On the basis of the data presented in this study, we conclude that binding of THC to cannabinoid CB1 receptors in hippocampal neurons leads to neuronal death.

To be fair, this excerpt refers to an experiment in which cells in a dish were bathed in a solution containing ~10x the THC concentration in human blood after typical cannabis use, according to the paper itself.  And the effect is blocked entirely by a CB1 antagonist - a finding that should extend to other CB1 antagonists such as CBD. 




 I'm not talking about conservatives - most liberal people think hard drugs should be illegal in some form.  Not to mention other forms of crime that could be aided by bitcoin!  It's as though you believe that the views of the vast majority of people don't matter - that bitcoin will do just fine if only a tiny minority of libertarian tech enthusiasts use it.

I don't buy it. 




 I've set myself up to sound like I'm just making a no true Scotsman...but I stand by what I've said.  It isn't clear from the brief quotations in the article precisely what is meant by that statement, but it's safe to say that whatever math was done is probably correct, and if the method were actually described the meaning of the result would be apparent to any educated observer.

Because the article doesn't share any of that information, it's fairly obvious that they're trying to manipulate you.  Not by giving you fake statistics, but by showing you an isolated result with no context or even clear explication of the result itself.  That is a very specific, limited form of manipulation which is very, very commonly used when popular media cite statistics. 




 That isn't true.  You're promoting a dangerous and false perception that statistics are completely open to manipulation.  In fact, statistics are open to specific, limited forms of manipulation which do not include the method you've proposed. 




 You have given an uncharitable characterization of what I have said, and then argued against that characterization.

Most people are anti-drug (in that they reject hard drugs and endorse their illegality), and most people are ambivalent about bitcoin (in that they are unfamiliar with it).

It would be a good thing if this sub had some decent answers for those people.  If I were anti-drug and knew nothing about bitcoin, and voiced my concerns about bitcoin and drug crime on here, I would expect to be turned away and not have my concerns taken seriously.  That would leave me with a bad impression of bitcoin. 




 You should consider how other people see this, though.

Some people think that bitcoin is more advantageous than cash or credit/banking systems for those involved in criminal activity.  In their view - which may well be correct - fiat currency and bitcoin are **not equivalent** in their potential to serve criminal ends.

Beyond that, not everybody thinks that these crimes should be solved by changing the law to make them not crimes.  Actually, most people think that things like human trafficking and hard drug sales should be illegal.

So perhaps you don't care and think this is all stupid - but that's hardly going to help spread the good news of bitcoin, is it? 




 This is a self-defeating attitude, though.  If /r/bitcoin ignores facts about bitcoin that reflect negatively on it from a mainstream perspective, and ostracizes those who express those facts, it merely serves as an echo chamber for a small slice of potential bitcoin enthusiasts.

This limits the potential of /r/bitcoin to serve newcomers, and makes the community appear distasteful.  




 I think the comment was highly relevant.  But I suppose we wouldn't be able to agree about that.

Usually when something is unoffensive but irrelevant, it just sinks with  few up or downvotes.  It seems very unlikely to me that the comment would get 10+ downvotes simply due to a perception of irrelevance. 




 two video's nothing to do with the article,

[How to use apostrophes](http://www.scribendi.com/advice/using_apostrophes.en.html) 




 Well...it seems that you've taken my plain, factual assessment that bitcoin makes illegal trade over the internet easier, and erroneously concluded from it that I think this means bitcoin should be destroyed.

This is exactly what I'm talking about!  This sub should not downvote people for saying things that are true about bitcoin, just because people are uncomfortable with these truths.

Similarly, we should not conflate statements of fact and their truth or falsity with statements of judgment about right or wrong, ought or ought not.

Bitcoin makes some illegal activities easier.  That is a simple statement of fact.  It isn't a judgment about what is good or bad, nor about what ought to be done.  It's like saying the Earth orbits the sun.  Whether that is good or bad depends on your point of view. 




 /r/bitcoin seems to have a problem with the truth.  Bitcoin provides a cash-like medium that can be easily, conveniently traded anonymously and without physical contact.  **Of course it makes it easier to sell drugs over the internet**
 




 It would be far more efficient to produce in a laboratory.  One person with a couple hundred square feet of space and access to ideal precursors could produce psilocybin at a greater rate than a warehouse sized grow op.

Also, you can create precisely measured doses, which is impractical / impossible with dried fungal matter as you cannot reasonably establish precise potency. 




 It's not just "more science is needed."  It's "more science of this type into this issue to answer these questions" is needed.  There's nothing to "debunk," because there's no lie.  But there are nontrivial, falsifiable claims. 




 This seems like the most important claim that actually has a coherent meaning:

Himalayan salt consists of mineral packed crystals that are formed naturally within the earth, and they are made up of 85.62% sodium chloride and 14.38% trace minerals such as sulphate, magnesium, calcium, potassium, bicarbonate, bromide, borate, strontium, and fluoride (in descending order of quantity).

This may be true, it may not.  Many pink salts have more sodium and less trace minerals.

But supposing it is true - does it matter?

Of course not!

By the time you eat enough of this salt that it serves as a good trace mineral source, you'll have eaten enough sodium to seriously endanger your health (assuming you do this regularly).  You can handle a couple grams of sodium a day.  If you ate a couple grams of this salt, you might get 2000mg X .15 = 300mg of various other minerals.

That's about as much dietary non-sodium mineral as you can get by eating a cup or two of cooked broccoli - along with very, very little sodium.

If your reason for eating this salt is because of it's mineral content, you'd be better served by buying plain cheap salt and a vegetable. 




 There's no result, really.  They needed a placebo group that didn't receive treatment.  Perhaps the homeopathic remedy did nothing, and the conventional treatment slightly prolonged the timecourse of recovery.  Perhaps the entire conventional group would have recovered on the fourth day!  Who knows.

Their only strong finding was that the homeopathic group didn't require antibiotics - a suspicious finding, for the reasons above and because they don't seem to have used a double-blind design (so whoever evaluates whether a person has improved may also know the treatment condition the patient was assigned to). 




 It's all relative.  It depends on what you're looking for, and how large your effect is expected to be. 




 It's unlikely that there is anything substantial to debunk in this paper - it's peer reviewed scientific literature.  If it were so ill-conceived that random people on Reddit could destroy it in a few paragraphs, it would not have been published.

However, the paper's claims are fairly modest, and are primarily a call for further research.  Anybody using this paper to claim that fluoride in drinking water in the United States is dangerous, for example, could be easily debunked by showing that this paper did not examine such low levels of fluoride, and provides no evidence for or against their safety. 




 The paper isn't arguing that fluoride in drinking water is deadly - it's arguing that there is strong enough evidence for developmental neurotoxicity that further research is warranted.

From their own conclusion:

In conclusion, our results support the possibility of adverse effects of fluoride exposures on childrens neurodevelopment. 

Future research should formally evaluate doseresponse relations based on individual-level measures of exposure over time, including more precise prenatal exposure assessment and more extensive standardized measures of neurobehavioral performance, in addition to improving assessment and control of potential confounders.

Nothing you said is particularly relevant to this claim, the central claim of the paper. 




 Rural Chinese water supplies are not known for their purity besides from fluoride levels, either. Arsenic and heavy metals are known to be present in high levels in both water and soil. Fluoride pollution in massive doses is almost certainly going to be connected to a number of other pollutants.

How do you respond to this (from the paper's discussion section), which directly addresses your objection?

Several studies (Hong et al. 2001; Lin et al. 1991; Wang SH et al. 2001; Wang SX et al. 2007; Xiang et al. 2003; Zhao et al. 1996) report other exposures, such as iodine and arsenic, a neurotoxicant, but our sensitivity analyses showed similar associations between high fluoride exposure and the outcomes even after these studies were excluded. Large tracts of China have superficial fluoride-rich minerals with little, if any, likelihood of contamination by other neurotoxicants that would be associated with fluoride concentrations in drinking water. From the geographic distribution of the studies, it seems unlikely that fluoride-attributed neurotoxicity could be attributable to other water contaminants.

That was a fairly unconvincing debunk, considering that you didn't bother to read the paper... :/ 




 Well, the ideal record would be a timesheet that was endorsed by your employer in some way (e.g. signed by your boss).  But since few businesses use paper timesheets anymore, its unlikely that you have that.  So a personal record that you kept may be the best you've got.  If it was recent enough, you could contact someone you worked with and ask them to verify your hours during that time on paper, and send that.

But if you don't have a record already, it seems like too much work at this stage to go through the effort of constructing one; it's also reasonably likely that they intend to pay you and it just hasn't got to you yet.

You can make a request for payment without the exact record; it just doesn't set you up as well for a lawsuit if you need that in the end.  But you can always add records later if you come by them. 




 No...you've stumbled on a stroke of genius, my friend.  If modern graphical user interfaces are too much for your parents, teach them command line systems instead!

"Honey, I'm just calling because I sent my email and now I want to read it again but I already sent it away and -"

"Mom, press the windows key and type "cmd" and hit enter, then "help" and enter.  All the answers I possess are now at your fingertips!" 




 You'll probably crave it in some way forever. 

Haha - dangerous advice for a guy who is freaking out about withdrawals from a single dose.  Tons of people take IV opiates without developing any cravings whatsoever - they are common in hospital settings.  It's not a big deal, and in all likelihood it will pass as soon as OP stops thinking about it and sobers up.

But OP - **do not dose again.** This drug is obviously not for you. 




 It's all fantasy; you live in your head too much.  Go talk to people, meet new people, make love to them and be rejected by them and learn.  This isn't a fucking romantic comedy film.  It's life.  The people you see, they are people like you - not like people in movies (nobody like that actually exists).

The feeling you have started in your testicles and has been fed and grown by your ideas about it into this behemoth of OMG HOW DO I MAK EMY MOOOVV.  It doesn't really matter in the long run.  If you want to find out what she is like, talk to her.  Say "Hi, I'm mlgfap and I like your skirt/top/smile/whatever.  What's your name?"  And have a conversation.

Then she'll be receptive or she won't be and you'll like her or dislike her or whatever and you can move on with life. 




 Yes - what material and how is it built?  If it is a bulky wooden stool, it may be trivial to add a few inches of height. 




 Well...wow.  Perhaps your parents really never allowed themselves to experience the natural emotions of being a parent. :/  I dunno.

My parents were really messed up people, and I can relate to some of what you shared in a first-person way.  I had a very traumatic childhood.  But my parents really did love and care for me.  I just didn't get to see much of that growing up.  Maybe your parents also love/loved you, in a private kind of way.  There could be some potential, some possibility there for a better relationship.

But you shouldn't feel guilty or ashamed if you don't want to deal with them; you're not doing anything wrong by protecting yourself.  It sounds like you'd be justified in leaving them behind. 




 **Yes**....teach them Unix. 




 If it is just a coincidence, and she's not interested, she will let you know very early on - as she will assume that you took it as a signal of interest.  So assume that she's into it and have a good time.  There's nothing special that you have to do, no approach you have make etc.  Just enjoy yourself and whatever happens will happen naturally. 




  Affirmative consent is the only way to ensure that it isn't weird.

That is simply not true.

I have never, ever, past  my awkward teenage years, said a single word about consent (do you want this, can I do that, whatever) during a first sexual encounter; there has never been any question about it.  And I've been with rape survivors etc, often having sex very early in the relationship, no problem at all.

Sex is not an intellectual act, and consent with formal asks is often very awkward.  It's easy to feel what's good or bad, whether a person wants more or less so long as everybody is reasonably awake and sober. 




 It's easy to take your parents for granted when you're young and they're alive and well.  It's likely that you'll feel very different about spending time with them when one of them has died.  It's unlikely that anybody will care about you the way your parents do - that relationship seems to be just about unique.  Your parents can love you in a way that doesn't depend on anything you do for them.  Nobody else is going to love you that way.

That said, it sounds like your Dad is a piece of work.  Guilting and shaming a 12 year old like that...ugh.  Still...they're your parents.  You shouldn't feel ashamed or guilty if you don't want to take care of them, but (as odd as this may sound) I think you may be missing out on something very precious. 




 If you have any record of the work you did, make copies and send those along with a letter explaining how much money they owe you and the address where they can send a check.  Send it to their HR person.  Don't send originals.

In most states, you have to do something like this within a certain period of time (often a month or two) after the job ended in order to ensure that you have a right to sue later if they don't pay. 




 To expect it, no.  But there is enough evidence supporting it as a reasonably likely outcome of the next 30 years of research that it shouldn't be dismissed as impossible or extremely unlikely without strong evidence.

You can find a lot of optimistic, yet pragmatic and evidence based commentary by searching for a scientist   science communicator named [Aubrey De Grey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aubrey_de_Grey). 




 Unless I'm terribly mistaken, the controlled substances act authorizes the attorney general, not the president, to do this, and it is not by executive order.  That said, the president could tell the attorney general to do it.

However, this process is not necessarily straightforward.  There are limitations on what the attorney general can do and when.  For example, they cannot reschedule a drug in a way that would violate an existent treaty obligation of the United States. 




 Yes - major error in the title of this post.  Not about Mars at all. 




 Executive orders aren't able to change things like that, though.  They can't contradict existing law, for example. 




 The penny's add a little more pressure to keep it snug.

Pennies.  Penny's would be a way of saying something belongs to the penny.  You can't make plurals with apostrophes with normal nouns.   




 Sugar alcohols are a common cause, and are often found in bars.

Also certain spices - especially garlic / onion type. 




 Hmmm...that hasn't been my experience at all; do you have a reference?  I imagine these things could vary substantially between individuals, but I would think that most people could absorb a few hundred milligrams of protein any time...

 Amino acid chelated minerals are absorbed via the mechanism that absorbs that amino acid normally (usually quite efficient), whereas minerals in an ionic compound that dissociates in water are absorbed via a mineral-specific mechanism that can be easily overwhelmed by high doses.  This causes diarrhea when the mineral passes unabsorbed into the large intestine, where it draws water out of the intestine's lining via [osmosis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmosis).

The reason magnesium oxide so reliably produces diarrhea is because it does not readily dissociate in water, and so most of it passes to the large intestine and draws water out from the body through osmosis.  Magnesium citrate does dissociate readily in mildly acidic water, so it is better absorbed, but will still cause diarrhea in large doses because the absorption mechanism cannot handle so much at once. 




 I don't know - I did a quick search but it didn't turn up anywhere near as much as the probiotic supplements.  Perhaps it just hasn't been studied as much.  Medical researchers tends to explore things that can be turned into pharmaceutical products much more readily than it does traditional medicine or food based medicine; it's one problem with the scientific community's dependence on corporate funding. 




 Well...the review references many studies, performed in a variety of human populations with varying states of intestinal health and bacterial colonization.  But it is true that the review primarily established the effectiveness of probiotic and synbiotic supplements as disease interventions.

However, that does not mean we can conclude that probiotics don't do anything in other individuals.  Most of the disease states explored in the studies referenced by the review are small intestine disorders - these people have normal stomachs.  That probiotics and / or synbiotics are able to survive these people's stomach environment strongly suggests that the would survive healthy people's stomachs as well.

Because probiotic supplements are quite affordable, easy to use, and safe, and there is some evidence that they help in various disease states, it seems reasonable to give them a try when faced with chronic digestive complaints that may be related to gut flora (i.e. almost all chronic digestive complaints). 




 If your team is oriented around the five-man deathball, though, go for the agh-refresher to **compliment** them.

[Complement, not compliment.](http://www.elearnenglishlanguage.com/blog/english-mistakes/complement-vs-compliment/) 




 Yes.

Most of the amino acid forms, including glycinate, are better absorbed than citrate. 




 No - in truth, probiotic supplements are often indicated for a variety of gastro-intestinal disorders.  Of course, a good diet is important, but BrainEnhance is simply incorrect in their assertion that probiotics are ineffective.  See the above review for more info. 




 That is not true - you are ignorant of the scientific literature on this topic.  Probiotic supplements have been shown in well designed human trials to survive and colonize the digestive tract, and to compete effectively with existing bacterial populations.

Don't take my word for it.  Read this recent review (free full text): 

[The Role of Probiotic Lactic Acid Bacteria and Bifidobacteria in the Prevention and Treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Other Related Diseases: A Systematic Review of Randomized Human Clinical Trials](http://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2015/505878/)

 Psyllium husk etc are mostly not fermentable fiber anyway - they pretty much just past through unchanged.  It shouldn't be expected to help, but probably wouldn't make it worse. 




 (off topic now)

Do you cook your own beans, or use beans from a can?

I've found a huge difference by soaking them overnight, tossing the soak water, and cooking them in fresh water afterward. 




 I think this is a great response.

But I would also like to add that you may find it much easier to explore these things if you found a more comfortable and supportive environment in which to use psychedelics.  In my experience, psychedelic experiences of fear are often heavily influenced by my state of mind and the setting I'm in, even if they are also a part of an existential crisis of some sort.

I've found it much easier to relax with these deep fears when I'm in a good setting and mindset. 




  You have provided no evidence that would convince anyone that supplements are a good idea. That alone is enough of a reason to not believe in them.

Why?  I'm just some random voice typing on Reddit.  Because I haven't provided evidence that supplements are effective at preventing MDMA neurotoxicity, you can conclude that they are not effective?

Doesn't that logic seem a bit...flawed? 




 If having a PharmD is evidence enough for you to believe yourself, then you really did miss the point way back in your undergrad when you learned the basics of science. 




 Yes...you do not understand the logic behind the science you're trying to debate.  Bye. 




 I think part of it is that many people just eat the mushrooms, which is not pleasant.  Because of this, people tend to dose low.

If we all learned to make shroom tea like proper psychonautic adventurers I think we'd see more interest in the drug, and more understanding. 




 You really don't understand.  Go back to philosophy class - you're not done learning! 




 Sort of - but in California, most of that demand is from out of state (or even out of the nation).  The state's water supply is being drained to serve an economic pressure that has very little to do with the state's residents. 




 It's not grammar, but intent.  And I won't - you're trying to get me to argue in favor of your straw man.  Why would I do that?  I have no interest in trying to establish a false claim. 




 Ah - that's different.  I live in a state with medical, and assumed this was a dispensary product.

Interesting...be careful with this stuff.  If eating it produces pronounced psychoactive effects, you should assume it is unsafe and may be synthetic cannabinoids. 




 , if any, 




 Of course not.  But many of the supplements people suggest taking to reduce the risk of MDMA neurotoxicity are approved for human consumption already, without human testing, because they are nutritional supplements.

So I do not think it is a reasonable comparison.  If somebody advocated for taking a research chemical with CNS effects in conjunction with MDMA as a harm reduction measure, and claimed safety on the basis of a mouse study, that would be extremely foolish (for the exact reasons you mention).

 Yeah, some people are in quite deep with the propaganda machine.

In my experience it's really not worth getting upset about or trying to change much, but when I do come in contact with it, I try to find some way to offer a different perspective without forcing the issue.  Something that they might consider later, like "huh...I wonder why he saw it that way."

Because there rarely seems to be any possibility of really breaking through that kind of ideology in one go.  It's really up to them. 




 Most people who get into kava and enjoy it use the root itself, usually purchased in powdered form.  Kava supplements are generally regarded as crap that should not be expected to produce a good effect.

This won't help you for your presentation, but I strongly encourage you to try the real stuff if you're prone to anxiety.  It's great!

 Yeah, sounds like some bullshit an extrovert would say while pointing to a chart in front of a room of people like a dick. 




 Whoah, whoah.  I know all of that.  I'm not here to debate the details of running a mining operation; I posted only to clarify an apparently mistaken analogy drawn between miners and bank-like entities.

edit:  Wow, just read your post again.  So rude!  Back away from the computer...go and play outside! 




 Could be, but it could also just be that there's CBD and THC together in this oil, and they're not heating it enough for the CBD to come through. 




 Perhaps there is substantial residual THC, which is vaporizing in full before any CBD comes through.  THC by itself yields an intense, overwhelming high at a proper dose - which could be a single toke if you're vaporizing refined oil.

You could test this hypothesis in part by eating a dose.  If it yields a potent high like it does when vaporized, you can assume that the oil is not CBD dominant - in this case, it may be synthetic cannabinoids mislabeled as another person suggested.

If it yields little psychoactive effect taken orally, then you may have an oil that is primarily CBD with a significant amount of THC as well.  This seems to be a very common product among CBD oils offered today. 




  I have the desire to be an educator 

whenever I get into a comment section like that I just go berserk with fact checking and proving people wrong... yet they all are so narrow

If you want to educate people with views like that, you're going to have to get more comfortable with exposure to those views.  People do not want to learn from somebody who is upset, hostile, or in any way overly invested in changing their view.

Teaching is a challenging, demanding activity.  It can be great fun!  But it does seem to require a great deal of acceptance of what your students are actually like.

It's very difficult to work with ignorance if you find it unnerving. 




 You got too high and likely had a panic attack.

This seems like the most probable explanation for the incident you described, OP.  And now, you have strong, visceral negative associations with your memory of the experience (sounds similar to PTSD).

It seems most likely that there isn't a direct causal relationship between the event and your symptoms over the following year, in the sense that it probably didn't "damage your brain" or something like that.  More likely, you got really high and also are prone to anxiety / panic symptoms, and this experience either triggered or coincided with the start of a chronic anxiety / panic problem. 




 The miners are not responsible for anybody's bitcoin, though.  It's not the same.

If they mine, they get new coins.  If they don't, they don't.  If they mine incorrectly, they don't.  But they have no liability as a result of anybody else's coins.

A better analogy would be a bitcoin exchange; if you keep bitcoin in an exchange, that entity likely has a liability as a result of your asset.  The difference, then, is that one can easily use and hold bitcoin without using a liable intermediary (like an exchange). 




 I think of it more like a psychedelic than like a depressant or simple buzz.  But I don't think of it as much like either; for me, it has a category of experience all to itself.

Cannabis is an amazing plant. 




  There is little, if any, evidence that they actually do anything. 




 Those are all fair points, and of course animal model studies don't offer direct recommendations for human  use.

But your language is too strong; it makes no sense to equate evidence from animal models with no evidence at all. 




 You're overstating yourself.   Why discount animal model evidence entirely?  The scientists that produce this evidence don't. :/
