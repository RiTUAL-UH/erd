 What does a group created and sustained by the state, that fights with other states about being a state have to do with a poly-centric law society...??

 good point... whos to say what 'hate speech' will no longer be protected by the first Amendment on the new 'free and open' internet... 




 wanna keep something 'free and open' - regulate the shit out of it... lol these ppl... 




 I love this guy. It was so classic when he [told a statist on facebook that they were to stupid to vote and that they shouldn't!](http://dailycaller.com/2014/09/20/libertarian-nominee-in-n-c-senate-race-calls-voter-ignorant-moron/) he was polling at like 11 percent until then... lol

[Also looks like hes launched a strong internet ad campaign](http://www.medicaldaily.com/pro-marijuana-ads-hulu-nc-politician-sean-haugh-goes-all-pot-legalization-307869) 




 Uh yeah... in a free market bad actors fail... you dont need more government to undermine what government is doing in the first place... you need the exact opposite....
