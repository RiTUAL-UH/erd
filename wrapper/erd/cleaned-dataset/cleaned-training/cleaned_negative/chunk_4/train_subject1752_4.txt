 Because Dana chooses the doctors.. 




 if your culture cant handle muslim neighbors, fuck your culture 




 have you ever smoked weed? jaywalked ? parked in the wrong space? etc etc

legal immigration is nearly impossible. stop using the law as an excuse to justify your hate. 




 their kids speak better American than you do, racist
 




 the system is broken. it takes over 10 years to immigrate legally. this is just a bullshit excuse. 




 /r/postnationalist welcomes immigrants 




 /r/postnationalist welcomes turks everywhere 




 /r/postnationalist welcomes canadians 




 You could reply to every post on reddit with that.. 




 too bad most amuricans feel pride when they see that image.. sigh 




 /r/postnationalist  




 Still no need for it..  




 Lol this comment would easily be upvoted on many subs  




 so youre defending "border" checkpoints anywhere within 100miles of the US border because the Supreme Court said it was ok? my god..  




 or youre just an idiot
 




 why do you always throw insults in with your posts? 




 according to /r/conspiracy every single event is a false flag..  




 pass a scientific peer review? are you kidding? look /r/conspiracy , you have to stop playing fast and loose with the facts.. i love you all but..  




 please point out the inaccuracy of my statement 




 don't bother asking that, (I do believe there was some form of conspiracy on 9/11, just saying), they never answer you.. 




 no see, there were red flakes in some dust samples that a lady stored in her house for 5 years before mailing off to a 9/11 guy to "publish" a "paper" in an online journal".. therefore nano-thermite! 




 america would do this too.. need a license for everything in the land of the free 




 k will remember keep britishpolitics posts discussion/effort 




 yea not a big fan of alex jones but hey.. fuck the border police~ 




 finally the casino loses. also funny to read in that article that bryan micon only got fined 25,000$ for running an unlicensed gaming operation.. guess he wasn't very profitable? 




 /r/postnationalist , fuck border police 




 meanwhile the UK is deporting nurses.. 




 this is actually a good use case for bitcoin, though. anywhere the government/banks don't let us operate, bitcoin becomes useful. 




 fuck UKIP /r/britishpolitics 




 and the TPP removes their sovereignty. but somehow that's a bad thing? 




 /r/postnationalist 




 because we don't let in any immigrant doctors or nurses

/r/postnationalist  




 /r/postnationalist 




 awesome please do! be happy to help fix it up too.. hope it can be a bit of a community document. 




 ladies of the night arent gonna hodl.. they want $
 




 this is actually one of the few good use cases for bitcoin -- when governments/banks start fucking with you 




 yea but who is gonna pay for Ellen Pao if we don't let them monetize us harder? 




 Basically any system can be tampered with though.. At least evoting gets more people involved  




 /r/postnationalist  




 If a "terrorist" wanted to cross from Canada to the USA it must be the easiest thing ever to avoid border patrols.. Just swim.. Or walk.. Etc 




 I can try.. Anyone have suggestions for stuff to add?  




 Samsung just can't compete anymore - all the Chinese manufacturers also copy apple and sell for half the price.. 




 oh please. OP is ranting about outsourcing and jobs going overseas. that has nothing to do with confession of an economic hitman. all it is is code-words for American nationalism. 




 same with most of the west.. its called "hitting your peak" [and rich people getting richer] 




 r u fucking serious? reddit is all anti-TPP, all the time.. every sub-reddit.. if anything id say reddit is shilling against foreign labor ~ 




 can we stop saying "ITS NOT ABOUT X, ITS ABOUT Y"
 
tomorrows post:

ITS NOT ABOUT JAMES HOLMES, ITS ABOUT THE TPP 




 not like they ever answer them..

Victoria gets my respect if she fought the commercialization, but she was already part of the problem.. her teaching the celebs how to shill their products more effectively at us.. 




 censored? 




 most AMA questions are shill/handpicked 




 I thought the problem was the fertilizers? 




 what kind of treatments did they do? 




 hah your stateless brothers 









 Plus all that bitch did was use her dank memes skills to shill celebrity products at us, fuck her  




 Join the OGs  




 /r/postnationalist if you're not already  




 The one that bitches about American government losing sovereignty to the TPP  




 /r/postnationalist supports inter-racial marriage  




 Don't we all? 




 So poor people are fucked? 




 You don't believe the Iraq war was about)$$? 




 YA the TPP is basically creating Oceania lol 




 Hi,? 




 China is cheap and safe and civilized  




 Wow  




 Humanity is just a step on the evolutionary ladder  




 /r/postnationalist 
 




 I've read all that too.. But.. Not conclusive. Is the fbi still hiding their results of the investigation or did they just not try hard enough? 




 Ask China how being "cheap labor" works.. Pretty well, actually (although income inequality is still a problem) 




 The interesting thing is how much this sub defends American sovereignty and "democracy" only when comes to the TPP and otherwise never  




 I'd rather be a waiter... Manufacturing sucks  




 Weird, she was such a good shill too.. 




 I'm safe! 




 What a waste of $ 




 Someone should........ 




 Vatican jesuits? What  




 And also pushing for unity between twelve nations, all allies.  




 The nwo is coming... If it doesn't ww3 will come instead  




 

So people overseas don't matter? Outsourcing makes tons of economic sense. Specialization. A global world is our future. Stop screwing poor foreign  people and focus on the rich fuckers.. 




 Sounds hilarious  




 This should be all over the real news soon if true!! 




 This sub is honestly not as big on research as you'd think.. Sometimes I get disappointed  




 The producers of it. Same as natural news benefits from fear mongering and I benefit by pointing out the obvious  




 Cheaper labor is people too  




 Heh if you proved it you'd have the story of the century..  




 yep 




 why do u require a source for this but not for what op says

because you are biased

but any expat community of dutch people is the obvious source 




 im not the one who thinks this is the key to unmasking anything

if you really believed that, make it so yourself! figure out his name, and call him.. hell a simple google search might turn his name up..
 




 break up with her 




 oh nothing to do with all the spying on everyone google does and their NSA connections?? please.. 




 don't do it man, just find a new gf 




 if she cant quit drinking so much it doesn't matter what you do.. 




 gamut 




 bankers would let them cancel their debts? 




 I think it was a genius way, to make it democratic 




 yea if people ask a scot out in public he can only say yes, right?  




 Could easily track down the dude.. 




 Fuck borders /r/postnationalist  




 When Dutch move abroad they also create a "parallel society" 




 Sounds like the UK  




 Britain already gave police broad dispersal powers  




 The government investigated those men heavily.. What did they find?  




 I mean just because they couldn't model it on computer doesn't mean it didn't happen.. I haven't seen any 911truth computer models either..  




 In China here, any moron can get a 20$/hour teaching job  




 YA it's amazing how stupid that statement is  




 The farm lobby is a government subsidized mess that punishes overseas workers.. I hope chomsky didn't defend the American farmer.. They have enough advocates  




 If the argument is the US pharmaceutical lobby will gain control in the USA.. I'm very lost  




 If anything state government is more corrupt.. 




 so fucking what? are we arguing regulations work now? do we believe in our government now?

if you ran a company and suddenly it got outlawed (THINK: UBER), wouldn't you like to have some rights too? 




 When I ask for a nickel-free earring because I noticed that nickel causes a rash and inflammation on my ear, no one hysterically accuses me of being "anti-earring". When you are evaluating the messages here, which you must do for the sake of your child's health, think about this:


--98% of people who want to get thimerasol out of vaccines are NOT "Anti-Vaccine" they want vaccines to be safer


--And yet, you will notice that there are hysterical straw men arguments made accusing people who want safer vaccines to be 'anti-vaccine'.
Start there. Why would ANYONE slam the parent of an autistic or brain-injured child and misrepresent their story and their wish unless they had an either religious fervor about vaccines or a financial interest or a desparate wish to hide the truth? If they are really concerned that people will stop vaccinating if they learn that vaccines have dangerous ingredients, then why not join us in making vaccines safer? There is no explanation for their rabid denial that poisons in vaccines are not a good idea, and their continual misrepresenation of this. Excpet a desparate wish to avoid blame or financial loss. Or simply a desparate wish to be correct.

 But what motivates parents of vaccine injured children and environmentalists like RFK Jr? Common sense and dozens of studies you can find in his book. And a wish to never see another babbling child anywhere in the world, become silent, as so many parents of mercury -poisoned have. It's a poison. Its in vaccines. Get it out! Enough said!!!! 




 at the bare minimum its about pharma contracts 




 I could never find any actual studies showing much disease from vaccinations except the thimerol stuff.. 




 that's a weird negotiating strategy.. 




 sometimes I admit I get a bit too conspiracy minded, hell I even did holocaust research (6 million jews did not die!) , but im not going to touch flat earth lol.. ive flown so many small airplanes.. 




 if someone could prove this, and it would be fucking easy, every scientist on earth would suddenly shit a brick

its not a conspiracy.. 




 for the flat earth conspiracy to be true, like 50% of humanity and anyone who has ever rode an airplane has to be in on it 




 Indeed, despite the often-decried undercurrent of Social Darwinism in Heinlein's science fiction, there also exists a significant dallying with transnational political organizations. Heinlein's idealism and pragmatism concerning international relations constantly temper each other, often producing entities that, if not necessarily ideals of charity and brotherhood, at least are not mindless predatory organisms but instead are commonsensical and neighborly. Heinlein seems to suggest - correctly, I believe - that without collective security we could find ourselves at the mercy of the real Social Darwinists.

 Heinlein's work with transnational organizations can be grouped into four main categories: the earlier, more idealistic novels such as Space Cadet (1948), which incorporate fairly successful transnational organizations that often attempt not only to keep the peace but to do other good as well, saving lives and protecting individual rights, all the while supported by generally democratic political infrastructures; the later, more cautiously internationalist novels exemplified by Have Space Suit - Will Travel (1958) and Glory Road (1963), wherein organizations consciously limit themselves to an often more pragmatic peacekeeping; the infrequent warnings against governmental intrusion, like Stranger in a Strange Land (1961) and The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress (1966); and, of course, the occasional pieces like Farmer in the Sky (1950) and Time for the Stars (1956), which merely employ some basically unexamined form of world government as a conventionalized science fictional backdrop. Though in 1958 Heinlein wrote to his agent decrying the naivete of the "starry-eyed internationalists" who urged disarmament and who longed for a "world state" (Grumbles 210), in his own work Heinlein himself apparently cannot help longing for some sort of transnational peacekeeping entity, albeit often a more practical one.

 globalism is the future. why do we divide our tiny group of humans into nations? 




 so you think the government is doing a good job or what? 




 apparently a no-carb diet starves the cancers..  




 do u have any studies on vaccines causing harm? recent stuff?  




 is what we have in America any better? lets bring the world together, so we fight less wars.. 




 because the common clay of America fucking hates foreign nations  




 I know not everyone here is an anarchist of course, I dunno what I am personally 




 We hate American government  until the TPP removes American sovereignty then we are all "democracy" "corporate takeover"  




 Yep!  




 Welcome to the list  




 Ya for me watching debunker videos helped.. Lots of the 911truth info is plain wrong  




 Because China fear mongering  




 Most Redditors now fall under /r/conspiracy "shill" label; proving how useless it is 

(not defending fluoride here) 




 Aipac would also want it classified if it was saudi too right?  




 Saudi Arabia  




 I downloaded all seasons of Steven universe in a day.. Too bad it's a bit childish for me but it's OK!  




 Because stealth is important vs the Arabs we are bombing..  




 The  enemy being China, who is happy to watch us waste trillions on this useless plane.  




 So how do we test for ourselves? 




 Unless it stresses the hair that's a myth  




 Also the dude is just making excuses for the status quo  




 Too late the USA USA circlejerking is in full swing  




 Oh please. It just happened. Every single news site was bashing the TPP hard, especially reddit. 




 check what western governments have been doing with that power lately and tell me it doesn't scare you.. 




 /r/postnationalist welcomes you  




 our government isn't a democracy, if it ever was 




 as if they haven't suffered enough.. 




 do you think your government cares about you now? let them lose power..

 SHILL accusations are the dumbest... Everyone who disagrees is suddenly a shill

 But it's funny too! 




 NAH it's bullshit anyway they were in Israel.. 




 Because if they release the agreement it will never pass. Why are so many Redditors opposed to joining together with 12 allied countries?  




 Because it's easier than attacking specifics.. Just imply it'd evil because it's secret  




 Reddit hates the TPP  




 Ya they also kept a bunch of Brits money..

 Good, government control is a total failure

 One can show that every developed country was aware of the risk of harm from continued emissions, as early as 1992 and in a number of cases even earlier. And therefore have a moral obligation to help those who have least contributed to the problem, and are most vulnerable to the risks, to adapt to climate change.

Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,
With conquering limbs astride from land to land;
Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand
A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame
Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name
Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand
Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command
The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.

"Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!" cries she
With silent lips. "Give me your tired, your poor,
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,
I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"

What I'm saying is that we are all going to need help. /r/postnationalist Were in this together.
