 According to this I should have been a hairdresser. Go figure. 









 Good neighborhood is relative. What are you looking for in a neighborhood? Same for gyms. Nice might mean something different to us. 




 Not everyone has a nice car and not everyone who has a nice car actually lives here. San Diego is a big place so it looks like everyone has a nice car. And don't forget that you can lease a Beemer pretty cheaply. 

Roommates definitely help and I know a lot of people who have them. You can find places pretty reasonably but you have to look around. You can find stuff on the beach for your $1k or less but you'll have to drive around looking for signs and check out craigslist. 




 Good stuff. Not enough people know of this band.

It's too good not to share. 









 Wow, what a great find! Those images are breathtaking. 




 Nicely done.  The file copied fine for me. 




 How about a happy start to the new year?

 









 The Raid: Redemption both one and two go to 11. 




 Very nicely done. Upvoted. 




 I totally agree with you. I found it intolerable with the over the top message and terrible acting. I cannot believe that it got as high of a score that it did. 

It took itself way too seriously for me to consider it a "fun" movie.
