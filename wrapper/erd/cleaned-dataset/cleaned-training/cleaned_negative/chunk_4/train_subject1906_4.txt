 totally get you. I wish that you find a doctor, who somehow finds a way to prescribe some ..well for me it was a type of antibiotic...while billing for some 'approved' condition.

totally illegal..~sigh~don't look here yea robots! 




 oh wow, I know her brothers! 




 If there is a spelling nazi god, you are fucked. Again, apparently. 




 while in his car. 




 that actually sucks, and I would suggest you visit a medical doctor is you are able. There are a lot of assorted treatments, many by prescription only (in US). You have likely tried over the counter solutions, so maybe try to see a doctor.

Edit: oh shoot forgot where I was.  Burn it?

 The projects identified in the $260,000 Jersey City grant are:

-- A resilience master plan that provides a framework to address and expand on the institutional, adaptation, preparedness, and recovery strategies;

--An adaptation master plan that describes specific projects and initiatives for the city to undertake that increase the city's resilience with particular attention paid to shoreline protective measures, new buildings and flood proofing for facilities;

-- Design standards that ensure building designs allow for floodplain management compliance and also maintain the desired streetscape environment;

-- A capital improvement plan that describes projects, budget, and funding sources for capital investments that improve resiliency.

-- An urban environmental design plan that describes strategies that mitigate storm impacts, including stormwater management techniques;

-- Amendments to the zoning and building code that require approaches to rehabilitation and new construction that are more resilient, but still maintain the character of existing neighborhoods. 




 In the event that Iran was to not finalize the agreement, they will have in place an air defense system which will ...inhibit... the ability of, for instance, Israel, USA and Saudi Arabia to respond to a buildup of nuclear weaponry by Iran.

 Conclusions

Based on the available data, and using internationally accepted methods to assess the
evidence with the most appropriate analytical techniques, WHO concludes:

1. Caesarean sections are effective in saving maternal and infant lives, but only when
they are required for medically indicated reasons.

2. At population level, caesarean section rates higher than 10% are not associated with
reductions in maternal and newborn mortality rates.

3. Caesarean sections can cause significant and sometimes permanent complications,
disability or death particularly in settings that lack the facilities and/or capacity to
properly conduct safe surgery and treat surgical complications. Caesarean sections
should ideally only be undertaken when medically necessary.

4. Every effort should be made to provide caesarean sections to women in need, rather
than striving to achieve a specific rate.

5. The effects of caesarean section rates on other outcomes, such as maternal and
perinatal morbidity, paediatric outcomes, and psychological or social well-being
are still unclear. More research is needed to understand the health effects of
caesarean section on immediate and future outcomes. "

WHO proposes the Robson classification system as a global standard for assessing,
monitoring and comparing caesarean section rates within healthcare facilities over time, and
between facilities. In order to assist healthcare facilities in adopting the Robson classification,
WHO will develop guidelines for its use, implementation and interpretation, including
standardization of terms and definitions.

 Why on earth are people harming these? 

There is another reported incident from February, " An investigation is underway after six quokkas were found dead in plastic plant protectors at an island camp ground about 8pm on Monday February 23."   http://www.watoday.com.au/wa-news/hunt-on-for-rottnest-island-quokka-killers-20150225-13owhi.html

Very weird. Does this island attract future serial killers?

oh jeez worse. "From August 1838 ten Aboriginal prisoners were sent to Rottnest Island (known as Wadjemup to the Noongar, possibly meaning "place across the water"[8]). After a short period when both settlers and prisoners occupied the island, the Colonial Secretary announced in June 1839 that the island would become a penal establishment for Aboriginal people and, between 1838 and 1931, Rottnest Island was used as a prison to transfer Aboriginal prisoners "overseas".
"It has been estimated that there may be as many as 369 Aboriginal graves on the island, of which five were for prisoners who were hanged."
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noongar

omg and then it was a boys reformatory! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rottnest_Island#Aboriginal_prison

 Wow,  I am so thrilled that I just read "The father was not charged with any crime.

Chitwood said the man was just "acting like a dad", and he didnt see anything to charge him with.

Asked whether he had any issues with the fathers actions, Chitwood said: "Not as a police chief and not as a father."

Police Chief Chitwood is the type of person I would happily elect to higher office.  

..and Go Dad!! for acting like a father and still having the sense to not carry it so far as to endanger himself with a jail term.

These two gentlemen may help change the usual unflattering opinions many have of their state.

 Climate Change, Water, and Risk Current Water Demands Are Not Sustainable

Climate change will have a significant impact on the sustainability of water supplies in the coming decades. A new analysis, performed by consulting firm Tetra Tech for the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), examined the effects of global warming on water supply and demand in the contiguous United States. The study found that more than 1,100 counties -- one-third of all counties in the lower 48 -- will face higher risks of water shortages by mid-century as the result of global warming. More than 400 of these counties will face extremely high risks of water shortages

 Ok back story seems to be that the mom was working 2 jobs, oh heck, here:

"Kevin Pimentel, 12, shot his brother Brady Pimentel, 6, dead Wednesday night at their mobile home in Hudson, Florida
He shot his brother Trevor Pimentel, 16, in the leg before killing himself

Kevin and Trevor had been cooking about 6pm when an argument erupted

Their mother, Helen Campochiaro, 38, was working one of her two jobs 

Relatives say she was a single mom who kept a gun for protection and that the boys had been brought up with gun safety

On a Go Fund Me page set up one day before the shooting, Campochiaro asked for help in raising a deposit for a new home"

http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3014264/Sheriff-describes-horrific-scene-brothers-shot.html



 




 why do you say that "(16 year old probably lied)" ?? 




 why do they have enough bullets for this to have occurred, yet apparently not enough food for the 3 boys?  Or were they arguing about what type of rice is the best?

Idk, this is very sad. 

The mother and another brother (age 18) were not at home. I hope the 16yo will recover well, and go on to lead a wonderful life; the mom   elder brother as well.   http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/03/25/food-argument-leaves-2-brothers-dead-1-wounded/70467588/

Edit to add that I really! hope that the gun did not belong to any of the children. IDC, if this was the parent(s) loaded gun that did this, let them suffer. I just really hope it was neither the 18 nor 16 year old's.

 "Thank's for uploading the amateur film, filmed by the American tourist Benjamin Gasul during his visit to Europe in spring 1939.

 "Dear Madame Lori Bernstein it`s very said and highly unjust what You say,
that movie was obviously produced before German Nazis conquered Poland.
Date of movie: May of 1939
Date of German nazi invasion on Poland: September of 1939
In the moment which is presented in movie there were NO ghetto in Warsaw.
I would appreciate if You look on Warsaw Ghetto history at YadVashem Institute website: http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/holocaust/about/03/warsaw.asp

In that time (presented at movie) Polish Jews were living in all sites of our tolerant community. Jewish and Polish people where living, studying and making businesses together.
And Polish people are the biggest worldwide group helping Jews in World War II, look again at website of YadVashem...:
http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/righteous/statistics.asp

In our country (only in Poland and Yugoslavia in occupied Europe) helping Jews was endangered by inmediate death penalty to all members of family helping Jews (by giving shelter food or whatever). That execution was realised by German Nazi soldiers in home where they found such a family.

 If it was a benefit of her employment, she likely wasn't paying for it, or was doing so at a discounted rate.  Perhaps they capped the coverage. 




 She was working in the field. Supposedly it was part of her employees benefit package.

I have a bad habit of ...say eating a tomato, and being all like 'gee that was yummy!', and thus saving some seeds.

I have become more conscious of where the fruits   vegetables I eat come from of late.

 "State attorney general
  
The state attorney general in each of the 50 U.S. states and territories is the chief legal advisor to the state government and the state's chief law enforcement officer. In some states, the attorney general serves as the head of a state department of justice, with responsibilities similar to those of the United States Department of Justice."  

from wiki: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_attorney_general

So yes, the state attorney general is a power office.

Perhaps she has been schooled at home, not often going outside, and perhaps had the sun moon/day night explained to her as "the sun circles the earth, then the moon comes out. Like when I spin this coin, the sides facing us change."

Or so I would like to believe:)

 It did send me off of a wiki journey where I have learned something about steatopygia, elongated labia, Saartjie Baartman, and the Khoikhoi people.  

All morbidly interesting, though I may need a drink now.
 




 Holy smokes.  A 5 year old found the baby. To me this the worst part, as horrible as it all is. 
 
"the baby's body was found on the kitchen counter by a 5-year-old relative who was dropped off to wait for his bus to school. 

The knife used on the baby was found placed in the dead baby's hand, Deters said." 




 I like 'OK'.  No one really knows... this is an interesting obituary, of the etymologist who, "FOR much of his long career studying language Allen Read sought the origin of OK"
    "Mr Read showed how, stage by stage, OK was spread throughout North America and the world to the moon, and then took on its new form AOK, first used by space people and frowned on by purists. This being an exercise in the academic world, there remain some doubters. Some believe that the Boston newspaper's reference to OK may not be the earliest. Some are attracted to the claim that it is of American-Indian origin. There is an Indian word, okeh, used as an affirmative reply to a question. Mr Read treated such doubting calmly. Nothing is absolute, he once wrote,nothing is forever.

 I guess people that do these sort of bizarre things are geniuses? 
No idea. 




  If it was a white or Asian teacher referring to a black student with the 'n' word every time she called on him in class,  would you be satisfied with a 5 day suspension???

Editing to add I am happy that the kid was unfamiliar with these slurs. Thankfully he had not experienced that particular reference (raghead taliban) prior to encountering this genius of a 'teacher'. 

First encounters with blatant racism can be pretty traumatic. I will be surprised if the parents don't file a suit in civil court for damages.
