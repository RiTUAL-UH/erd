 There is a [May Festival performance](http://www.mayfestival.com/festival.html) that evening - Wagner and Verdi! Definitely fancy, and great, classic song selections; one of which is the Bridal March, so you know, romantical (if you don't actually pay attention to the plot of the opera.) If you used that in your wedding, it might be double romanticals.  




 or not. Let's have a 3 up 3 down 9th! 




 Oof, I would love to see them pad the lead here in the 8th - come on Bruce! 




 If you have a smartphone or tablet, you can listen to 700 WLW on the [I Heart Radio app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller). It's free. It's supposed to be online as well, but I was having difficulties. Oh, and here's the link of you're an [iPerson.](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/iheartradio/id290638154?mt=8) 




 Check out the [Cincinnati Art Museum](http://www.cincinnatiartmuseum.org/visit/info/employment), they're always looking for part-time security guards, and I think they might be looking for cafe servers right now. It could be something to tide you over! 




 If you're up in the Mason area, I've always liked [Natorp's](http://www.natorp.com/). 




 Sorry to see a business close its' doors, but I don't think they'll have issues filling the space. Didn't have a great experience there though - it was for a bridal shower and the hostess had reserved their "party room." It was not totally closed off, which was fine, but then they kept seating other patrons in the area, even though the rest of the restaurant was open. Just...odd. 




 Thank god I'm not the only one! I thought I was taking crazy pills. I also had the distinct misfortune to post something snarky to Cubbies on facebook. I think ESPN should have to pay for my embarrassment.  




 I have friends swear that the place is haunted.  




 I don't think you have to have a ton of background in finance either. I had a friend get a job there recently with a marketing/photography background. 




 Homer isn't even his real first name - it's David. He took Homer as a nickname [after his grandfather, apparently.](http://cincinnati.reds.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070219 content_id=1808414 vkey=spt2007news fext=.jsp c_id=cin) 




 I found an article when [Reggie Sanders charged the mound in 1994](http://articles.latimes.com/1994-04-14/sports/sp-45939_1_perfect-game). I don't have any evidence that this is the most recent occurrence, but that's the latest I've found with minimal research. 

I don't think Choo will though. He seems too even-keeled for that. And I don't think anybody wants another [Carlos Quinten](http://i.imgur.com/kKzlslW). 




 Upon seeing an advertisement for a Civil War Chess Set on TV, I asked incessant questions about the "Silver War." 

 




 My parents did it themselves - and while quite a bit of work, it's not terribly specialized. The brunt of the work was leveling the ground where they were putting it in. I'm sure the folks at Home Depot or Menard's would be able to advise as well.  




 The [Crafty Supermarket](http://craftysupermarket.wordpress.com/) in Clifton is that day too! 




 [Here's looking at you, Sanabia.](http://i.imgur.com/3Mf9Hxk) 




 I'm glad you finally got to see a great game - and that you stuck it out to the end! I fell asleep with the gamecast playing on my tablet in the 11th. It was great news to wake up to though! 




 Ha, yes, I was! It was really awesome, it was my first year too. Bruce was definitely great; I thought everyone was really super.  




 Not quite, but I was [Votto adjacent](http://imgur.com/jcAA94D). He seemed to be only taking pictures with kids, which, you know, fair enough.  




 Almost everyone. Votto and Frazier were definitely there, but they seemed to be only taking pictures with kids. I was standing next to two cute kids, so I was able to take creeper photos. The only players (excluding DL) I didn't see were Heisey and Chapman. And they had said in the invitation that the day's pitcher and catcher wouldn't be out, so no Bailey - though I did get one with Mesoraco! I also got pictures with Paul, Simon, Ondrusek, Broxton, Cingrani, Hannahan, and Robinson. Latos and Arroyo were there too, but I was busy getting another picture and I didn't manage to catch them.  




 My brother went with a [blank back style](http://shop.mlb.com/product/index.jsp?productId=3462659 cp=1452348.1452717.708007) - always relevant! Women's jerseys only come in [blank/personalize-able or Votto](http://shop.mlb.com/family/index.jsp?categoryId=1503775), so I decided to become part of the team :P  




 Thanks!! I really had an awesome time - my heart *was* racing at times! Go REDLEGS! 




 Season tickets! They sent us a invitation/ticket and you had to rsvp. It started at 10:30 before Sunday's game. You entered the park near the bullpen, and could get a spot anywhere around the outfield. Then the players, coaches, and announcers started making their way around! Everyone was really nice. I have others as well - but I only posted the highlight reel.  









 Well that was a beautiful thing to see upon waking. Now, I have 15 hours to get this nightmare fuel out of my brain 




 For everyone interested, ESPN is actually [filming a documentary](http://cincinnati.com/blogs/tv/2013/04/05/espn-films-teddy-kremer-for-e60/) about Teddy for their E:60 series. 
 




 He also asked for 11 K's - which they also got! For those who aren't Great American Ball Park regulars, everybody in attendance gets a free LaRosa's (4-topping, small) pizza! 




 This is going to sound harsh, but don't. Unless they specifically have put out a call for pieces, they don't want to hear from you. Museums and curators get a million calls from people that want them to look at their stuff. And many of you may find it cynical, but we generally don't care unless you are interested in donating it. And half the time not even then. It's an issue of being underfunded and understaffed (a fairly universal problem in the world of non-profit museums) that we just don't have the time to look at everything that comes around. A lot of museum's do have days in which members can bring one or two pieces in to consult with a curator. Think Antique's Roadshow style, where we don't tell you the value. I know some of the auction houses even do it. 

For what it's worth though,  it is a very lovely piece, I just wouldn't bother a museum unless you really want to part with it.

 I hope your girlfriend also got you a pillowcase 




 Yep, I have family that chastise me and get upset when I say "oh my god," and I'm almost 30. I just don't bring up religion with them. It may be disingenuous, but they're my family that I hardly ever see.
 




 I had a class with a Allen Mandelbaum whose translation of Dante's *Divine Comedy* is very well-regarded. For his class he assigned the [cheapest, paper-back copies of his translation.](http://www.amazon.com/Inferno-Bantam-Classics-Dante-Alighieri/dp/0553213393/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8 qid=1365800058 sr=8-2 keywords=allen+mandelbaum) Once class convened, he even asked us if the price was okay, and if it was too much he might be able to help.
