 If you don't have any genetic eye disorders or diseases you could try some exercises to strenghten your eye muscles which in result will help with better focus and vision.

 20/70 to 20/160 : is considered moderate visual impairment, or moderate low vision

20/200 to 20/400 : is considered severe visual impairment, or severe low vision 




 It's great things are starting to move in this area as we are forgotting that estimates for blind people exceed 39 million worldwide and more than 246 million have some kind of severe or moderate visual impairment. This is probably one of the worst impairments a person can have.
