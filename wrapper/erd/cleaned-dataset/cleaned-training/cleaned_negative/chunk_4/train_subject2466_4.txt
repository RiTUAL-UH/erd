 I met my best friend detasseling in the corn fields of Nebraska.  Getting on a bus together at 5am and walking rows of corn until 2 in the afternoon = bonding time.  We knew each other's life-stories in about 2 days. 
("Detasseling corn is removing the pollen-producing flowers, the tassel, from the tops of corn plants and placing them on the ground.") 




 I got saline implants under the muscle...while I was in the recovery room waking up from my anesthesia, the nurse kept asking me what my pain level was and if I wanted to take a pain pill.  I refused.  After I woke up some more they moved me back to the room where I changed into my gown before the procedure and I slept in there for a while.  The nurse came in quite a lot to ask me if I needed anything...all I wanted was water.  After a few check-ins with the nurse I finally accepted a pain pill because yes it hurt, but it wasn't unbearable.  Upon returning home I was sore but again, nothing unbearable.  They prescribed me a bottle of 30ish strong pain pills and I only took 4 or 5.  They also gave me a packet of pills to put under the tongue for when the pain pills made me feel like vomiting.  These were a life saver more than the pain pills were.  I don't even want to think about how much it would have hurt to puke right after a breast augmentation.  




 That we are going to have to break up when I go active duty in the Navy this coming summer.  Don't get me wrong, I love him and all...but I don't want either of us to be miserable the whole time I'm gone. 




 They set the guy free while investigating further?!  If it was a full grown adult found encased in concrete instead of a baby would they be letting the home owner go?  I don't think so.
