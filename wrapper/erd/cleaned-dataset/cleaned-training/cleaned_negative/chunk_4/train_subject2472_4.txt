 Even if the submission weren't a video (rule #5 in the [Rules for Submissions](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/wiki/rules#wiki_submission_rules)), it doesn't reference new, peer-reviewed research (rule #1) and therefore it can't be reinstated. I would suggest posting instead to our sister subreddit /r/EverythingScience.

 Papers submitted to the *Journal of the BVA* might be peer-reviewed but that does not necessarily mean that they're all research papers. In the case of this submission, it's pretty clear that it's a review paper and not a research paper, in particular since it appears in the Vet Record Careers section of the journal and not in the Research section.

 Not a repost.
