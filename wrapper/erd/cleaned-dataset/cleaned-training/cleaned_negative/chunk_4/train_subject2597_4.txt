 All 4 of those electoral votes from a state that is basically Vermont.  




 Free college and health care wasn't delusional enough? 
Bring on the downvotes.  




 If only he had his own campaign subreddit. Oh wait... 




 That requires people actually watch it 




 Like the undecided voters in Family Guy  




 It would get upvoted if Trump said it because reddit loves to laugh at him  




 Genetic conditions are one thing... 




 1,000 years from now historians can just look at videos of the past, assuming they don't fuck up and lose the ancient technology of mp4 etc 




 I would like to reinforce that it's the insurance companies that screw up costs, not the hospital or clinic. The purpose of insurance is to collect as much money while paying out as little as possible. The hospital will charge $100 for an advil pill but will only get $10. That's why bills are so high, it's a negotiation game.  




 The person pays more, but the hospital gets paid less. They hospital charges an uninsured person less than an insured person because they can actually get money from the insured. 
The ambulance service I works for only sees payment on 30% of patients. That means 70% of our patient won't pay a cent, including their insurance or lack of.  




 [Well 21% of the health costs could be fixed if people ate better and exercised] (http://news.cornell.edu/stories/2012/04/obesity-accounts-21-percent-medical-care-costs).
It's no coincidence that the most obese country pays the most for healthcare.  




 My university had experiments on board. Good thing we still have another one orbiting Mars  




 I think you left out the part about cars  




 I reported another post for the same violation and the mod claimed the source post wouldn't load for him. It was the official Sanders web page.  




 That was my thought. If by some tiny chance the guy recognized his own car then mission accomplished 




 Does this count as a witch hunt? 
Obviously not in favor of littering but reddit rules are rules  




 [Well this is awkward] (http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/26/rand-paul-gets-highest-marks-marijuana-policy-proj/) 




 Title rule violation, mods either need to enforce the rule or get rid of it instead of being selective based on their opinion  




 Only if lanes are clear on the sides. Good luck doing that in a traffic jam  




 Well there would be a car blocking the way... 




 Colorado Springs University  




 /r/tall 




 Fixed 




 You brought up football. 

Colorado had one bad year after getting snubbed one year, making the tournament the next 3, including a pac 12 tournament title.  




 Yeah it must be great critiquing others when your school has zero chance of ever making playoffs being in the MWC and all. Especially when you go 1-7 in conference.

4th recruit for CU so far

[Scout] (http://www.scout.com/college/football/recruiting/player/194665-akil-jones/news)

[247sports] (http://247sports.com/Recruitment/Akil-Jones-87153/RecruitInterests)

Other offers from Wyoming, Utah State, San Diego St 

 




 Well you used the old one in the post  




 Says the mountain west school. Talk to me when you have 30 national championships  




 Alien blue shows flair  




 Someone didn't hear about our [new unis] (http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5526826ee4b0788926c507cf/55443953e4b0e11ffa878af3/55538015e4b03971c5bae4b2/1431535638051/2.jpg) 




 Because Colorado plays at Hawaii they are bowl eligible at 6-7. There's a couple other things that would have to fall in place but odds would be favorable for Colorado. Plus Colorado SOS is crazy  




 Like all $10-$20 of tax payer money? You should she the shit that goes on in Washington  




 Imagine how different this would be if she was shot  




 A popular phrase used to show disapproval of the current US president, specifically used here about the Infringement of constitutional rights by some states  




 Thanks Obama!
 (yes I know he had nothing to do with it) 




 I'll look out for that, my browser defaults to https  




 Unless the people change to a "bad" view. 
Like hypothetically people decided they were against gay marriage and then Obama tries to ban it. 
 




 Damn that post filter isn't catching much  




 Probably SNL Bush 




 But it also shows how the politician can be swayed  




 I'm not Republican  




 Also a lot of social media and technology has changed in the last 7 years. Bush never had the chance to make a BuzzFeedVideo  




 It had a lot to do with voters supporting it 




 So that's the change he was talking about in his campaign.... 




 So mods, this violates the new title rules because it uses title AND quote. I guess it stays because Sanders, fuck off mods  














 4-0 OOC, beat Oregon, USC, UCLA. Win the bowl game. End season 8-6 




 The thousands of posts from people wanting to take advantage and get fake Internet points wasn't enough?  




 I'd say more important  




 Or hopping on the karma train  




 [he's an amazing writer too] (http://nytlive.nytimes.com/womenintheworld/2015/05/29/can-you-tell-if-these-passages-are-from-bernie-sanders-weird-1972-short-story-or-fifty-shades-of-grey/) 




 Right around the same time he wrote gang rape erotica 




 Or the right wall will be the inside wall of a circle  




 See the side bar 




 Well you got it, just keep in mind they close the roads for the fireworks so you'll have to hike  




 Freedomest?

Well the US didn't get any smarter  




 Take advantage of all the people rushing to get married = $$$$ 














 Roughly 15 lbs? About a pound a week for us Americans.  




 There's also stuff to open blood vessels and vitamin b. I use preworkout and lift noticeably better.  




 Fellow tall, I've put on 30lbs in 6 months. A good amount is fat but I was so skinny I didn't care. I'm not even skinny fat so the weight looks good. Just lift a lot and eat a lot, worry about muscle tone later unless you get a huge gut  




 What are you asking? 




 Brace yourselves for all the posts "X states their thoughts of the legalization".  




 And this will be the biggest post in reddit history  




 Sorry, my brain is filled with very small rocks  




 Braces yourselves for the biggest post in /r/politics history  




 Maybe wedding ceremony costs will increase initially due to demand? I'm just spit balling here 




 Can't we just celebrate this without talking politics? 




 Anything on if private places that host weddings are allowed to turn a gay couple down? That's the next big thing to tackle  




 I had no idea this was even going on in the court. That language is so official yet so moving  




 Says Walmart on the store  




 Man its sad no one on this sub cares. I'd say we should have /R/Wisconsinpolitics but politics makes the majority of content here. 
Let's go Decker and Frank!  




 They aren't air force  




 Fall of Colorado  




 North-Oregon,Stanford,Cal 

South- USC, Arizona, Utah 

Games circled- Oregon, Cal, USC  




 Air Force, Colorado, CSU, GT. 
You can't do that. The Colorado teams hare each other, GT hates CU  




 glad you guys could get over the clipping call, unlike someone.... 




 3 




 Utah. 
Ideal pac south would be Colorado, Utah, UCLA, ASU, USC, Arizona  




 Well an Arizona player is now playing with Dinwiddie in Detroit  




 [how dare you] (https://twitter.com/sportsnation/status/614232190189240324) 




 If Dinwiddie didn't get hurt, that year would have been awesome between Colorado and Arizona  




 I'm just coming from back in to talk about Stanley Johnson joining Dinwiddie in Detroit  




 I think the glory days are done already. Tad didn't take advantage of the success when it comes to recruiting. Probably barely .500 this season  




 [Just let me know how many times you hear his name] (http://youtube.com/watch?v=ZpAVEHHTz9s) 




 Yeah, Colorado doesn't even like him. But losing him isn't helping the team.  




 And cross country  









 Man you guys love to hate on him, you do realize no CU fans were happy he said that right? 
1/12 64-63 CU
3/12 53-51 CU wins pac tournament 
1/13 83-92 AZ in OT, you know damn well there wasn't enough evidence to overturn Chen's buzzer beater 
2/13 71-58 CU, RedemChen, the Valentines Day Massacre.  




 I used muscle milk a few years ago and stopped after a couple months. Too much sugar, it's basically an over marketed halfway decent protein  




 Football has shown more fight than basketball. I don't know how they show their faces after the game against Seattle. No excuse for losing that tournament  









 Are we a football school again?  




 How convenient it happened the year we don't go to the desert. Conspiracy theory- XJ didn't want to leave CU without a win at Arizona 

Plus Colorado died with Dinwiddie ACL  




 Well I believe he gets another year of eligibility, might be good in the long run since our recruiting sucks right now  









 Now put it in the oven and have apple chips  




 YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TIED UNC AND THEN WE WOULDN'T HAVE THIS DISCUSSION! IT'S YOUR OWN FAULT  




 How many Courics?  




 Well when you're high up you have potentially hundreds of people gunning for your job. Fuck up and they bring the next guy in.  




 Great example of why the schools don't need more money, they need to manage it better. My high school had less money than the area's public schools but students did better because of home life, discipline, and teachers that cared.  




 Well to be fair a big reason why inner city schools perform poorly is lack of discipline.  




 Well doctors already have performance checks, just in different ways. They retake the board exams every few years, those are fucking difficult. Doctors get sued and have lawyers evaluating everything looking for slip ups. If you fuck up, your patient gets worse or dies.  




 Those tangles  




 So this dude just runs out of a store with his arms full of crab legs while yelling fuck her right in the pussy and the woman working the store cries rape  




 I can neither confirm or deny buying beer for some of the linemen 




 6-7, then win the bowl game  




 Score on the first play of the 5th down series. Then GT would stop bitching even though the voters new all about the 5th down and chose Colorado anyways. They only won their poll by one troll vote 




 Or you know, a play that doesn't result in a tie for GT-UNC.  




 USC. It's a Friday night blackout game on ESPN.  




 YOU'RE JUST MAD WE LEFT  




 GAME THREADS AFTER DARK, COLORADO AT HAWAII 11PM MOUNTAIN  




 [can I get some of those recruits?] (http://cdn.meme.am/instances/58868050.jpg) 




 Biggest College stadium in a 500 mile radius, a live buffalo running around the field, you can legally get high before the game, the most scenic area in College football, and a [rooftop area] (http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wrk-ut5oUDc) WITH BEER overlooking the field with the Flatirons background  




 ALL MY PAC BROS ARE STILL SLEEPING   




 CSU CAN'T MAKE IT PAST THE FIRST NIT ROUND AFTER COMPLAINING ABOUT GETTING SNUBBED FROM THE BIG DANCE  




 [I CAN'T HEAR YOU] (http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/3176771/eminemhigh.gif) 




 Coach Mac and Bobo for control of weed research. I don't know  




 HOW ELSE DID WE GET 5 DOWNS  




 YOU FORGOT FUCK DOOK  




 AT LEAST THEY CAN'T BE CHARGED WITH POSSESION  




 He doesn't need help, it's Madison.  




 Can here we see competition doing its job in the market  




 Because they game is in Hawaii, and on a Thursday. So they have it when they finish class. It's stupid 




 IT'S ONLY 1030 HERE 




 This offer brought to you by New Belgium Stadium  




 Well CSU will have a shiny new stadium 




 First they confuse us, then they shall attack  




 Colorado beats Arizona at home  




 Nov 13 (USC) will be a long night if we win, guessing it'll be the blackout game since it's 7pm on ESPN  




 Let me know what you find, my interest has peaked  




 Well we could take a few billion from the defense budget.  




 Colorado  




 Cut the budget in available areas.  




 I'll have class the next day, but only one.... 




 According to a projection from the non-partisan Tax Policy Center, the top 1 percent of Americans will pay 45.7 percent of the individual income taxes in 2014up from 43 percent in 2013 and 40 percent in 2012 (the oldest period available).

http://www.cnbc.com/id/102581780 




 3) the game starts at 11pm Mountain  




 Middle class could use more spending money. Lower the taxes.  




 Well the top 1% already pays half of income taxes 
http://www.cnbc.com/id/102581780 




 But a handful of millionaires can provide the government with money to operate
