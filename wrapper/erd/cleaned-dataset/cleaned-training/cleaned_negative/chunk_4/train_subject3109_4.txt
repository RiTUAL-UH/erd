 Moved from r/news by mods because too many people were reading it there... 




 I did post it in [r/sandy](http://www.reddit.com/r/news/duplicates/12e3hf/looting_arrests_made/)
and posted it in r/news also and more people are reading it in r/news then r/sandy. 




 Hell if I know?  If I had posted this in Politics the mods would have filtered it and said it belongs in Worldnews. I post stuff then someone else post the same story then mine gets pulled for being a dup. 




 For the election?

 I can inhale and exhale through both at the same time no problem, I guess I'm a freak.  




 If you can't afford a walkin clinic You might try your local health department or if you continue with the high temp or it goes up go to the emergency room the worst that can happen is they'll give you aspirin and send you home. Good luck!

 You seem awfully short how do you reach the peddles?:) 




 Yep they'll gut the EPA if they have their way. 




 Sorry... I didn't write just passing it along, but up vote for commenting  




 Awesome ideas keep them coming. 




 Good observations I'd like to know the answers to that.

 You know it turns your pee green... 




 What really got to me was I had some white tee shirts I hadn't wore for a few years and when I unfolded them they had tar line at the folds also my PC when I opened it to vacuum the dust out, the dust was covered in yellow tar and was stuck to the inside of the computer like glue. And now a friend of mine lost half a lung and is dying from lung cancer but still will not quit. 




 I quit 2 years-ago but 4 years-ago I stopped smoking in the house and car it really helped when I finally quit.  




 Thanks for reposting this as I would have missed it if you hadn't. Sometimes repost are a good thing. 




 Well I agree with you but anything goes apparently... I sent the mod's a note about it 




 [Yep](http://torrentfreak.com/student-hit-with-fine-in-riaa-case-090731/) 




 By the fines they will impose and seizing assets. 




 I was think that if any part of the plumbing that is on that guy fails the water pressure could cut him to shreds. 




 That was my first thought... 




 You've got over 1,000,000 brothers and sisters here at reddit! 




 Well you're in the same situation as me then, so make your own life with someone and have a bunch of kids and go broke.

 India is an awesome Democracy and hopefully they can preserve it unlike we the people of the US.  




 Just not in that order... 




 How about a NSFW tag! 




 Defiantly do not throw anything over the fence as your neighbor may be videoing you. You could be accused of inciting the dog.  




 Video the dogs aggressive behavior and then go to your local law enforcement or animal control and show them the video hopefully you'll back the authorities into a corner and force them to take action before some innocent gets hurt or worse.

 Really... some people take the internet far to seriously. It's good to see you have a sense of humor rather then just going off the handle and showing the world you're unstable and unable to read people... like some posters. 




 If you two don't cut it out I'm gonna pull over and stop this internet and someones gonna get a spankin! 




 She should go first...

 [At present, no specific diet is known to prevent cysts from developing in patients with PKD.
Low protein diets have not proved helpful to
PKD patients with advanced kidney disease.
Nevertheless, it is not wise to eat excessive
amounts of protein. Reducing salt in the diet
helps control blood pressure in PKD patients
who have high blood pressure. A diet low in fat
and moderate in calories is recommended to
maintain a healthy weight.](http://www.kidney.org/atoz/pdf/polycystic.pdf) 




 Yep, Homer turned him on to beer and he turned into a instant drunk. 




 This post seems to be more about your karma then the uplifting story.
