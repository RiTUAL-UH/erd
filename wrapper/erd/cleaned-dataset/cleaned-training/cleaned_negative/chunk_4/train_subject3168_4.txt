 Which was my point, a website cannot go down, or people go somewhere else.  Hopefully it can be reliable now, so I can start posting there and learn some python :) 




 It's the most interesting story related to a history of a forum.  Most are just like, "Dude, I just created a forum for such and such, go post there."  Lol. 




 cool, you got the flair working!!! 




 also metulburr, i might add, that currently only fill_array() and display_array() functions work, the swap() function is only used in the sort_array() function which i have commented out at the bottom so the function is never called.  I still have to figure that part out. 




 How weird is that, I didn't read Mekire's thread before posting mine, but it mentions about sorting methods which coincidentally are the same things I'm reading about in my textbook right now.  Taking a peek at: https://github.com/Mekire/pysort/blob/master/pysort.py 




 Ok so you guys probably know my little brother, metulburr, I am train_subject3168. I am pretty new to python and just learning. I'm a computer science major in college at the moment.  Anyway, in a programming structure and logic class I'm in (intro level) in our textbook, the chapter I just read described the bubble sorting algorithm for sorting data, it has flowcharts and pseudocode and I thought I'd try to translate it to python (I'm using python 3.3.4 right now) I have functions for filling an array and sorting the array and then displaying the array, the filling and displaying work now, I still gotta fix the sorting one, but the real question is, my brother was noting that it shoudn't work at all because I have global variables and I use them in my functions, well look at the code:
    
    array_size = 5
    scores_array = []
    comparisons = array_size - 1
    x = 0
    y = 0
    temp = 0
    
    def fill_array():
        x = 0
        while (x  array_size):
            userinput = input("Enter a score:\n")
            userinput = int(userinput)
            #for i in range(5):
            scores_array.append(userinput)
            x = x + 1
    
    
    def sort_array():
        y = 0
        while (y  comparisons):
            x = 0
            while (x  comparisons):
                while (scores_array[x]  scores_array[x + 1]):
                    swap()
                x = x + 1
            y = y + 1
    
    def swap():
        temp = scores_array[x + 1]
        scores_array[x + 1] = scores_array[x]
        scores_array[x] = temp
    
    def display_array():
        x = 0
        while (x  array_size):
            print(scores_array[x])
            x = x + 1
    
    fill_array()
    
    print("\n")
    
    #sort_array()
    
    display_array()

now what is interesting is my brother pointed out to me that the code above runs with no errors, yet the code below throws an error "UnboundLocalError: local variable 'var' referenced before assignment"
in this code:
    
    var = 0
    
    def addone():
        var += 1
    
    print(var)
    addone()
    print(var)

Why is this? Does anyone know why the latter code throws the error but the first doesn't?
 




 I don't know the guy currently running the python forums website, as I'm pretty new around the forums, but it seems to be down an unacceptable amount of time, rendering the whole forum useless.
