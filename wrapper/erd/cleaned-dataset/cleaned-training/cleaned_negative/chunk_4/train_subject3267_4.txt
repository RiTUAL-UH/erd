 to add to my other comment: intelligence isnt anything we do. we do not give it to ourselves. we are born with whatever intelligence we have. so we cant legitimately take any credit or blame for it. none. no matter what anyone else says.  




 yeah im nervous too. we havent been able to control big games. we havent been able to dominate the end of games. we lose a lot of games we could win. doesnt instill confidence in me for the playofs. we have the talent, but.... 




 well that fructose has has an effect on your brain. 

keep eating all that fruit, if you really do. right, all fruit is the same, it is the same as all the vegetables. you are not a fool. 

 




 intelligence is of no value. the dumb is just as valuable as the smart. like the book of Ecclesiates says, the rain falls on everyone's heads and death awaits us all. it is a myth and delusion put forth mostly by academia that smart is better (in any real way) than dumb. dont buy in to their self-serving game. this would actually be an unintelligent thing to do - as following the herd generally is. further, most truly intellingent people never get recognized. and they also usually realize that real intelligence doest give a flip about recognition from the masses.  




 So there is no such thing as a conspiracy theory?  




 Eat a pound of pineapple everyday for a month. Open your eyes. Note the weight gain.  




 Obama said something? Great. Why do I care? 




 You are full of it. Bananas arent the only fruit, fyi. So you are already following my advice and paying attention to sugar content in fruit, and distinguishing between them. Sure call it fructose, but that doesnt change the point. Try eating pineapple every day for a month. You will gain quite a bit more than if you ate a typical vegetable. Whether it makes you fat like people at the supermarket isnt the freaking point. Either way, to say all fruits can be eaten as much a vegetables can be, and there is no danger from the fructose/sugar content in some fruits is goddamn ignorance. 




 so it goes without saying that people should pay their taxes? that taxation laws and enforcement are legitimate? does that apply under other regimes as well, or only in the US? 




 I'm traveling now, but will try to give this a sufficient response when I get settled.  Cheers. 




 Most of them are Lakers fans.  




 You have to pay attention to the amount of sugar in fruit. Not all fruit is that good for you. You can easily eat it and get fat. VERY different than vegetables. 




 Save. 

Read Irwin Schiff's pdf, "How an Economy Grows...." 




 Im with you there 100%. Nietzsche def had attitude rare in philosophy.  




 the existentialists are quite enjoyable: Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Camus, Sartre, Heidegger (difficult). i recommend the first two. these guys might grab you more in that they are about your existence, etc., not just ideas and abstractions.  




 I love SK, but have come to wonder what the leap is toward/to, if one *really* doesn't know. If God isnt manifest and things arent rational, we might as well take a leap toward the Great Wall of China. I have come to believe that SK was more about faith in faith itself.  




 You might check out Larry Brown. Father and Son, Joe, and Fay to name three to start with.   




 I dont find them interesting at all. Different? Sure, a little. For one, though the structure at the exterior wall is somewhat novel, it severely limits the amount of glazing, and thus blocks the incredible views way too much. Truly good architecture wouldnt do this.  




  Jesus Christ, the paradoxical God-man, who is both Atonement and Prototype. (For Kierkegaard, following Luther, faith must needs give rise to works.)

Then who/what was the object of Abraham's faith?  Weren't the objects of SK's and Abraham's faith the same thing?

 Revelation through the Word of God, the witness of the Holy Spirit, and the Spirits gift of faith (see, e.g., For Self-Examination, pp. 25ff., 77, 81-82).

These are indirect manifestations, if they are manifestations at all.  Words are hardly manifestation, unless they are audibly spoken and heard directly.  The "witness of the Holy Spirit" is an inside baseball term used mostly by Catholics; I don't know what it means.  And if the Spirit gives us faith, then what is there to worry about?  Does it only give faith to the good and pure?  If so, it's not much of a gift.

Indirect manifestations are easily doubted, challenged, confused and conflated.  Why would a self-proclaimed loving father *only* manifest himself in indirect, mysterious ways?  Especially, when he has power to do it literally any other way you can imagine (even retroactively) and with no negative side effects?  

 Epistemologically, because the manifestation does not provide apodictic certainty

Sure, but this is subjecting God to the limitations of man.  He supposedly can and does transcend our limitations all the time, just not in ways that we really need it, ways that aren't disputed, conflated, etc.  I mean, he supposedly made/makes the rules.  If he wants a relationship with us, he should make himself known.  He should love us like he asks us to love others.

I'll check out Ferreira's piece ASAP.  Thanks.



 




 The Book of Chuang Tzu. 

Like drinking a glass of cold water on a hot day.  




 except that i don't find homosexuality natural.  




 ok now we are getting somewhere. i dont really disagree with you here.  




 yes. im with you there to a point. but non aggression only asks one to govern one's own self. no laws required. there may be a law in place that determines what happens when aggression takes place. but that is only secondary, and doesnt prevent the harm from occurring. if i had my way, i'd say that when you steal or hurt someone, all bets are off. no laws necessary. 

and to me, anarchy is balance.  




 the tao is just the way of nature.  




 just read lao tzu and chiang tzu. maybe listen to alan watts and read his taoist books.  




 this is exactly it. stop trying. stop asking what SHOULD i do.  




 or yoga, taking a walk, or running long distance 




 regarding your last paragraph: incidentally, or maybe not, that is what libertarians and some anarchists call the NAP (non-aggression principle). "don't hurt me and don't take my stuff." basically the only "rule" they have. fyi.  




 good idea.  




 if it is a race, nothing is more important than winning. life is full of teamwork all over the place. it is odd to expect it in a triathalon.  




 If everything is Taoist then you have no point at all. And what are you even saying? You're certainly not disagreeing with me. Did you read what I said about you not understanding paradox? The paradox here is using words to explain that words are the problem, that words are anti-Tao - since it needs to be spelled out for you. Read the first sentences in the TTC - for starters. 

You began by saying I have a limited view of the way. Then you go in to say that nothing is 'more' or 'less' Taoist. 

For instance, using the most simple example possible: if the tao that can be described is not the true tao, one would have to say that the tao that is described is not the true tao. You, contrary to this, are saying that the tao that is described is just as true as the tao that cannot be described. You are dead WRONG about THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL ASPECT OF THE TAO. 

So you are either a fool or a liar or both, as your very statements make clear. You aren't fucking honest with yourself. Stop playing semantic games while claiming that words and artificial distinctions are just as Taoist as anything else. You are wasting our time. 

 




 You are welcome. It is actually online here too:  http://www.wwoz.org/new-orleans-community/livewire-music-calendar 














 Listen to WWOZ online. It the excellent Nola commercial-free radio station. They broadcast events every 2 hours. I think at the top of each odd hour. It will give you a great idea of what is happening and where.  




 Further, the law is all about words and arbitrary distinctions, written by a self-selected few (lawyers) who, by virtue of their education are different than the rest of us. Couldn't be less Taoist. 

Could you tell us what, in your view, are things contrary, anti, or un-Tao? 




 To me, that seems more like a faith in faith itself.  




 Assuming you are one of the smart ones. :) 




 "Try to be more positive." 




 No.  




 You are getting hung up on words. You don't understand paradox. The Tao can't even be described - so you should say this entire subreddit is anti-Tao. You are defining the Way as "whatever", and that is simply false. I don't disagree with many of the statements you make, but that just underscores the extent to which you misunderstood me. To say that disharmony with the Way is somehow the ying to the Tao's yang is a fallacy.  




 Yes, Im doing the exact same thing in reverse order.  




 Laws are artificial and very much anathema to the Way. They involve coercion, force, punishment, hierarchy, etc. - the very opposite of the Way. Taoism is essentially anarchist.  




 What was the object of Kierkegaard's faith?  How was that object manifest, if at all?  If it was manifest, why was faith needed?  If it wasn't manifest, why is it assumed to be the object?

Do we choose what we believe?  Or are our beliefs more like realizations of what we already hold to be true? 




 You sound like you would definitely like Kierkegaard. Perhaps also Taoism.  




 Not sure what you mean by that. Could you explain a bit please? 




 So if he doesn't write enough tickets, he doesn't get paid? Do you really think that has occurred even *once* in the history of mankind? 




 You really think that explanation applies to governments and their goons with guns (police) too? 

Besides, you're saying they steal, therefore they must have needed to steal. You're not saying they need money therefore they might steal.  









 So they only do it when they need money? Do you steal from others whenever you need money? 




 yeah: Governments, central banks, wall street.

 "The Way of Zen", Alan Watts.  




 you may or may not. and may or may not want to. we must realize that meanings and qualities are subjective. they arent inherrent in life. though life is indeed precious and fragile. 




 from his 'philosophy of taoism' series.  




 Thanks. Got it from one of Alan Watts' lectures on Taoism. 

The West also sees the world as artifact. Forgot that part.  




 meaningless life isnt necessarily a bad thing. life is life. we can give it a meaning that is entirely subjective and internal. doesnt need to be found. nor should it. i would recommend checking out taoism. read 'the watercourse way" for starters. it is not a philosophy or religion, but the way of reality. most problems arise with language and concepts and "learning".  




 no. one guy fabricated what he said. at least he said later that he had fabricated it.  there were at least two others though. and Fine's wife saying she knew about his behavior all along was probably the most damning.

 they could keep doing this one more year stuff forever. move to LA already.  









 yeah they did. i think it was iraq. and they did something similar to syria too, more recently. 

 




 im not even going to read all that. and regret having even responded to you to begin with. you are clearly not honest with yourself and/ or your view of the world is subject to your twisted view of your own sexuality.  i mean, you dont really think im talking about gay pride parades. your comments are so layered with contradiction upon contradiction upon false premise - for starters. you, like many non-heterosexuals, do yourself and your supposed "cause" a disservice by talking. shut up and have sex with whatever you want. we dont care.  









 right.  if they are trends, then we don't need to be told.  if they are trends, we already know about them, as you do.  and if they are trends, they aren't really something that should be validated, emphasized, or perpetuated, per se.  tired of all this reductionism, and formula.  and description as proscription a la rem koolhaas.  this is all one gets in 99.9% of academia.  what about non-trend architects and architecture?  they should report on that.  they should lead, not follow.   














 Trends.  Yea. 




  In a perfect world it wouldn't matter, but in today's society social visibility goes a long way toward determining what people determine is the "norm". More public figures that are not-heterosexual there are, the less people will see non-heterosexual people as strange or not normal.

Instead of trying to make something "normal" by getting it out there and making people think more people are into it, try to encourage people to be themselves and do what is right *regardless of whether is is accepted by popular opinion, or regarded as normal, etc.*  Because we all know that "normal" has nothing to do with popular or accepted, and even less to do with whether this or that individual *should* behave a certain way.  The road is narrow, right?  Sure, it might encourage them by knowing it is accepted, but that doesn't mean anything.  It puts the cart before the horse and actually is counter-productive in that it turns people inside out.  You tell them that what matters are appearances, not what you choose to do privately and by *your own* conscience.  So much of the gay movement doesn't get this.  They want acceptance, including self-acceptance, so they act out.  They turn the most private thing into everyone else's business.  Then they defend themselves on the grounds of a right to privacy.  So there is this reflexive disposition among gay people to cheer on anyone in the public arena who is gay or bi or lesbian and comes out.  Like Ra Ra Ra someone is gay and they tell everyone about it.  Most people don't have a problem with gay or bi people practicing their sexuality.  It is this overt "look at me, I'm gay" thing that betrays a deep artificiality to it all.  It appears too forced and external and even political to be natural.  

  Well, I can definitely tell you that I didn't choose it.

Maybe you didn't choose it.  But if you look at gay males, for example, you'll find that they didn't have a bond with their fathers and/or were extremely over-feminized by their mothers.  This makes them want a male bond, makes them act like women, etc.  Not a choice?  Maybe.  But certainly not genetics or biology either.

 Um, it isn't your place to determine people's sexuality, so why are you even asking this?

I'm not saying it's my place to determine people's sexuality.  I'm saying I shouldn't even be able to know what it is, right?  Because it is so private, as homo's and bi's themselves argue.  But you are implicitly advocating that homosexuals or bi people let everyone know - so that it can look like a lot of people are into it and therefore it is then somehow regarded as a norm.  Why is this even in the public sphere?  Instead of advocating for gay marriage, those on your side (I'm not sure about you, specifically) should be advocating for getting government out of all marriage altogether - especially if you're an anarchist.
 
 




 the first part:  for instance, is homo/bi-sexuality a choice, or is it an acquired taste, or is it biology?  

the second:  the OP was cheering on a bisexual governor.  if you regard that as just someone, who happens to be an anarchist, saying something nice about someone (based on sexual preference, and the fact that they're a governor) in what happens to be an anarchist forum, then....you have no point at all.

still: i'd like to hear it explained why/how i even can or should know someone's sexual preferences.  aren't they private, not my business, difficult to determine without being given signs/mannerisms/queues, etc.?   




 i once opened a bank account right behind a couple who opened an account before me.  the banker put their $9000 in my account.  i told them about it the next day when i discovered it.  they gave me a free book of checks.   




 then there are all the unspoken assumption which must be true for bisexuality to have legitimacy.....  nevermind how this is *anything* for an anarchist to be doing. 

tell us, why/how are we supposed to even know someone's sexual preference? isn't it quite a private matter? and hard to ascertain by observing nonsexual behavior? 




 yeah power should be as local and decentralized as possible. and that was the way the founders of the US intended.  




 look up james files online. he plausibly claims to have killed jfk. check it out before you dismiss. his story is riveting either way. there is a pdf and book you can get too.

 so you found it defined on the internet.  ok. 

have you ever heard the word used in your life outside this post? what about "biphobia"? is this a fear of bicycles, bipeds, binoculars, bison.....anything bi, or what? 

further, the actions it refers to as monosexual would include heterosexuality. good luck with that.

 INTJs are actually extremely sensitive.  




 kierkegaard. the existentialists. then later, taoism.  




 yeah right. monosexualism isnt really even a word.  




 arent anarchists against governors? why are we even supposed to know their sexual preference?

 Well the author for you then is Peter Hathaway Capstick. Start with "Death in the Long Grass", "Death in the Silent Places", "Death on the Dark Continent". Page-turners, all. Totally incredible, true stories. Excellent writing.  




 Woody Allen 




 In other words, you're still searching for meaning? 




 yes, you are right. i over-responded to your comment, and was venting a little to the readers as a whole. and i appreciate your thoughtfulness. 

yet:  the best writing is by authors who remove themselves from the story, and are completely a medium. they are transparent and not injecting hints of themselves. it detracts and is distracting. it is not about them.  it is immensely distracting and counter-productive to not use quotes. 

i strongly believe he is perhaps the most over-rated author of our time. good grief, how much is he going to descibe a sunset with "thin" and "like blood"? try to find another word, cormac. and this punctuation thing is just over-the-top. Pretentious BS in my opinion.  




 yeah i was thinking that exact same thing. didnt need tuco. he isnt a good actor or that strong of a character. 

edit: by "strong", I mean nuanced and interesting.  




 I hope not.  This show should introduce new characters.  No value to replay the Breaking Bad characters, except for novelty's sake. 









 his audience shouldn't be decided by who likes less punctuation and who likes more. I mean does anyone ever complain about too much punctuation? Never. 

Mark twain? Too many commas.
Leo Tolstoy? Too many apostrophes.

otherwise they would've been great writers. 

if you're talking about Cormac McCarthy's audience as those who will like him no matter what, and anything he does or doesn't do is marveled at by them - that isn't so much an audience as it is a cult following.  




 i'd recommend "man and nature", "myth of myself",and "limits of language". they are on YouTube, About 45 minutes or an hour long each. 




 Instead of less punctuation, how about less pretension.

edit: just noticed my previous very similar post here.  




 instead of "use mispelled words", you could have just said "mispell words". though i realize the former sounds more blatant and careless, the latter sounds like a trivial mistake.  




 yes, i have found that alan watts' writings and speeches on taoism and on the "self" or non-self are quite illuminating. there might be some recordings on youtube if ur interested.  




 who we are and how we behave has less to do with our willpower and intentions (how great we make ourselves) than with chance. 

for example, smart people dont become smart by reading books and going to school. how were they smart enough to know that reading and schooling would be good for them?  they already had something in them that wasnt taught or found. (socrates for the win.)

further, what is the self? mostly an illusion.

 All the Neil DeGrasse Tyson worshippers should read this. 




 That's true.  :)  (Well said.) 




 Yeah, I find that too - that I've held viewpoints all over the board during my life.  And will probably change them again too.  And yes, it's best not to ascribe everything to this or that category or label.  Just to be, to get through the day, to be real and practical and functional, etc.  But the fact that different, even contradictory, views can be held underscores the subjective nature of "truth", that it comes from within and not from without.  For now. 




 I'd like that too. 









 what made you less of a subjectivist? i became very subjectivist too, though i think i still am.  




 seahawks or lions 




 ill check it out. thanks.  




 the only philosophy that ever grabbed me and deeply resonated with me was/is existentialism. particularly kierkegaard. and by extension, nihilism. nietzsche, sartre, baudelaire....

but recently i discovered taoism. it shares much with existentialism and is in some ways more simple and profound.  




 it means your first comment was bogus. WSJ/reason actually quotes Warren directly. that is going to be hard for you to dismiss.  easier to ignore.

 I know that Li is organic order, as opposed to mechanical or artificial order.  What I really want to know is if this is a subcategory of wu wei, or could be regarded as its own separate principle of Taoism.  

I am writing a paper and that is why I ask, and have to organize it and articulate it somehow.  I realize that really Taoism doesn't have principles and can't be reduced, or formulated, etc.  

Right now, the categories in my paper are 1. Yin yang 2. Wu Wei 3. Te.  Would Li be a subcategory of one of these or its own category?  I welcome any tips or advice on this matter, and on Li in general.  Thanks.

 How does Taoism reconcile mental illness?  Is it natural, is it a type of disease?  What about mental illness that is brought on by trauma?  Also, mental illness can severely complicate one's relationships.  If we are to live in harmony with each other, how can that be achieved if one is so involuntarily out of harmony with themselves?  I would appreciate any and all thoughts on the matter.  Thanks. 














 This is a more theoretical piece on aspects of a certain architect's work. I think it is quite good, if I say so myself. And I would like to get it published somewhere - somewhere that gets a lot of readership - either online or print or both.
