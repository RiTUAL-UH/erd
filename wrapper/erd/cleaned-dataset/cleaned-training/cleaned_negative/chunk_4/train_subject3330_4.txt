 What, do they think Tea is naturally sweet and they "un-sweeten" it to make Tea?

Cause if thats the case... They are retarded. 




 Saw part of the trailer and nope, just nope... Not even going to bother pirating it either.

Don't feel the need for a remake or reimagining or whatever the current buzz word is.  




 You have the colour contrast/saturation way too high man, damn near eye burning.  




 The PSPGO was awesome,  I had all the games I wanted without having to change umds, I had the TV out dock so when I got home I could throw it on my TV and continue playing with a SATURDAY controller.

Sure not not all games were available, but the selection they did have wasn't exactly subpar either.

If you didn't like the PSPGO you either didn't have one or never took advantage of all its features.  




 Sister: Mom, /u/lachryma is bleeding worms all over the table through his head hole...

Mother: That's ok honey, at least he bought potato salad this year. Lets eat? 




 3DS is just as bad, everyone owns the same 3 or 4 games and the rest is garbage.  




 Eh, I bought it at launch based on what they were advertising / hyping and that was a handheld that plays games that rival that on the PS3.

Games like Uncharted, Wipeout, Gravity Rush. As well as the announcement of titles like Bioshock, Warriors Lair etc. And showing the tech demo of MGS4 touting how easy they could scale back games to port across... which was pure hype to garner sales and line their pockets. 

These are hardly anime/jprg titles that plague the handheld market... But they are what we now have because Sony fucken bailed shortly after release and did nothing to push western developers to continue working on the Vita and burning bridges with the ones that wanted to.  




 HE CHOPS HIS OWN HORSES HEAD OFF AND USES IT AS A WEAPON!? 




 *Gon rolls into the room* 




 You're right,  an omelet does sound good about now. 




 Fuck that noise, that may be fine for some / you.
I play my PS4 when I'm at home and I can wait 5-10 minutes to go take a shit 
without the need to pick up a Vita to continue my gaming session on the throne.

Myself and allot of other people bought the Vita because it was sold to us as a "portable console". Ya know, to play games on the go, not at home.

But where are those portable console quality games now? Far and few between. 

Where are the shovelware / indie titles?  Fucken everywhere... Not too mention they have already been on every device. I dont want to spend $15 on a game I played 2 years ago on my toaster. I'd rather spend $40 for a portable Resident Evil, Infamous or a new damn IP... 

My Vita has been gathering dust for some time and thats even after risking purchases on the slew of Anime/JPRG schlock thats prevalent on the Vita just for something new to play.

But hey I guess I should be grateful that Sony allows me to play PS4 games remotely all the while passing them off as Vita exclusives right?

 [Heres a quick colour of the first one](http://i.imgur.com/4i4U9Se.jpg) 




 Nope, it's paid only through  the grounded bundle or stand alone. 

You got it for free If you bought the GOTY or PS4 remaster. 




 Different DLC, that was the Left Behind DLC. Which was well worth it.

But was not the Grounded mode DLC. 




 Different DLC, that was the Left Behind DLC. Which was well worth it.

But was not the Grounded mode DLC. 




 Yeah it came part of a bundle, but not the Left Behind DLC. 

It was The Grounded Bundle and it was for multiplayer maps, perks and weapons, not single player related at all. 

They also sold it stand alone at $4.99 USD. (Seems like the price went up, it's now $7.55)

I mean cool, It's nice they sorta threw it in along with multiplayer DLC and gave other people the option if they want it or not... 

But again they are charging for a level of difficulty, something they could just patch in.  

Let the circle jerk continue I guess?

Edit: clarified a bit. 




 Didnt Naughty Dog do this with The last of us?

They released paid DLC on PS3 that was a harder difficulty...They charged you for a level of difficulty... The worst part is people still fucken bought it.

So much satisfaction in getting that as the finishing move.

 Got them from here, when this sub first started, one of the users here made them.

I'll upload them onto imgur later on if you want them?

 They fixed the issue with 
transparent backgrounds / pngs a few updates ago, it no longer does that weird flashing thing when you change screens. 

So you can have a background like yours with the flowing background color of your choice instead of a pain black. 

Just an fyi is all.

Enjoy.


Edit: Codes are NZ/AU region.  




 Thanks,  and yeah overlay mostly.  Sometimes multiply or hardlight.

I know what you mean about it looking painted on at times. Still trying to work on getting more natural colors... When I lower the saturation or make the layer more opaque it just looks... bland/washed out.

Thanks again for the input,  any tips would be appreciated!

 They were $80+ In NZ at launch. And sure they got cheaper during the PS2s life cycle... But going at the launch prices, that is give or take $1120 worth of memory cards.  




 Serious question, what the hell is up with the current trend of releasing "teasers" for a trailer of an upcoming movie? 

"Oh hey, you know that movie you know is coming out? Well here's a teaser trailer that the actual trailer will be out soon..."

What's next? They're going to do a press conference to announce an upcoming teaser of a teaser of the trailer for their movie... Why not just skip the bullshit and just release the trailer...?

It seems people care more about the hype and publicity surrounding movies / entertainment than the final product these days.

 It can play Vita games, PSX games, PSP games and remote play PS4 games. So it has a decent library.

It's not actually a bad little device,  it's just that the memory for it is way too expensive, the native Vita games library is very JRPG heavy with little else available. 

It's not something you'd buy without research... otherwise you'd be somewhat disappointed.  




 Yeah, they have to get rid of those PS TVs somehow, going to guess this is better than simply throwing them out.
