 This is to review of the first volume of the three volume biography of Stalin. The first volume is 1000 pages long. 

Clearly, this guy is trying to give Robert Caro and his biography of LBJ a run for his money in terms of comprehensiveness and quality. 




 I like his analogy of involuntary employment means the same thing as being involuntarily married. Both are matching problems. Adding the word involuntary is just confused to the search and matching problem at hand. 
 




 There was a massive trial with the polio vaccine before it was introduced in the whole community. The trial involved hundreds of thousands of children. 




 Measles is the most contagious disease that is known. It is therefore not possible to use tort liability to sue the specific person who infected you because it is not possible to trace the infection to a specific child.

The classic example was polio. 90 to 95% of people infected with polio were asymptomatic but infectious to others. It was spread by failing to wash your hands properly after going to the toilet. Small children tend to do that. 




 1. Babies are too young to vaccinate.
2. The vaccine is only 95% effective.

 SUBMISSION STATEMENT

An excellent roundup of how the religious exemptions constitutional jurisprudence moved from the courts from making balancing decisions on a case-by-case basis to the Scalia majority opinion of 1990 that the Constitution only outlaws intentional religious discrimination. 

After that, under the 1990 Scalia majority opinion, religions have to take their chances in democratic politics like the rest of us if they want special exemptions from laws. 




 SUBMISSION STATEMENT

 I did notice anywhere in the article them pointing to a country that managed to get out of the extreme poverty by increasing the minimum wage. The only evidence the author of the article pointed to was from the United States on the effects of the minimum wage.

 SUBMISSION STATE.

Nice roundup of the politics and economics of federalism on the extent to which there should be free trade between the states and whether one state can regulate how another state produces its exports to that state. 




 ADMISSION STATEMENT.

Another nice little roundup showing that the number of false positives in research is disturbingly large. The incentive to uncover these are small because the rewards of reinvestigating other people's data is generally small in a world of publishing or perish 




 SUBMISSION STATEMENT.

This book is a defence of attack ads and negativity in politics. It includes the best, worst, and most counter-productive attack ads broadcast all time to illustrate its points brilliantly. 




 SUBMISSION STATEMENT.

A nice little roundup from the Guardian on scientific fraud, which is far wider than previously thought. The key driver of this fraud is the publish or perish motivations of academics before and after they get tenure. 




 SUBMISSION STATEMENT.

A nice little summary of the history of diplomatic spying, much of it which is for economic advantage.  

At the 2009 G20 meetings in London, the British intelligence agency GCHQ set up fake internet cafes for delegates to use in order to log their keystrokes. If you are dumb enough to use an Internet cafe for official business, you deserve to be spied on. 




 There is a massive difference between rowdy protest at a public meeting, and ambushing a politician while dining with his family.

The discussion of the complex way in which personality traits interact with political dispositions. Questions not asked include:

1. People become more conservative in their voting as they get older that their personalities stabilise at 30;

2. Women change their vote more often than men, depending on whether their married divorce, single parents or have children because of the demand for social insurance. How was this connected to personality traits?

 The flaw in the reasoning about administrative costs been at driver of higher costs in America is competition.

Leaving to one side the Federal prohibition against interstate competition in health care plans, and any state mandates as to what must be in ill health care plan, two considerable asides, all the is saying is there is an entrepreneurial opportunity to win business in health insurance by offering simple plans that are cheap to administer.

The extent that administratively complex plan survive in competition rather than because of mandates, suggest that consumers are willing to pay for whatever they buy. 




 SUBMISSION STATEMENT.

A nice summary of the reasons for higher health costs in the USA by the most experienced health economist around.

 Are you aware of the far more extreme views of some of his coalition partners such as the those made up of emigres from Russia 




 Read somewhere that 74% of government employees in Canada are unionised as compared to about 15% of private employees. That makes a big difference to headline comparisons that do not make this distinction 




 SUBMISSION STATEMENT.

Part of a series in the Guardian on science and the green moment.

This entry makes it a good case in my mind that the green movement is somewhat selective in its use of science 




 Isn't that the point. a national single-payer system still involves denial of service and people dying in the queue. 




 I read somewhere that the 8% success rate is similar to sitting down with a good friend and having a discussion over the fact that you drink a bit too much and that is really harming your friends and family 




 Interesting, I didn't know that the public sector was so unionised in Canada. That is ignored in the international comparison.

Indeed any international comparison of unionisation should always split out the public sector in the private sector to have any use whatsoever 




 SUBMISSION STATEMENT.

A new study looks at the peaks of different types of cognitive abilities over a lifespan.

Apparently, them young whippersnappers got a good memory for information, but we oldies have a better vocabulary, and superior judgement 




 SUBMISSION STATEMENT.

A nice article about the extent to which lazy statistics intrude into public policy. 

More than a few statistics published by breathless journalists run into the problem that more people in the community have been a victim of a crime or some other more misfortune than there are actual people in that community with the relevant demographic characteristics be it by age or whatever.  




 SUBMISSION STATEMENT.

No one doubts the sincerity of Alcoholics Anonymous and those who participate and organise that movement. This article argues that its treatment programme has simply been overtaken by events and more effective options are available.

This is important both in terms of coping with alcoholism and the fact that some people are required to attend Alcoholics Anonymous as part of sentences imposed by courts.

Nice little myth buster explaining that although gerrymanders has a bit of a role, there are many other reasons why the American electorate is so polarised.

A good list of replies to criticisms of fossil fuel disinvestment. It can't seem to make up its mind that about what it's trying to do.

In the end, the purpose is to bring moral pressure against self-interest, which is a real stayer in human affairs. You can always rely upon self-interest to keep on trying right to the end of the race.

 Peace treaties usually bring an end to matters such as reparations and draw a line under all claims, be they public and private 




 Germany paid war reparations to Greece in about 1960. Naturally, Greek politicians stole it and hardly anything filtered down to ordinary people

 SUBMISSION STATEMENT.

This is a fine summary of the work on the Dunning Kruger effect by Dunning himself explaining that people lack the ability to recognise their own limitations, principally through overconfidence. 

To recognise you lack skills such as in the rules of grammar, you must have extensive knowledge of the rules of grammar to realise you don't know the rules of grammar.

Deirdre McCloskey, in this great book review, argues that Industrial Revolution just got along just fine, despite quite endemic government corruption. Something to ponder.

Fair Trade-certified coffee is growing in consumer familiarity and sales, but strict certification requirements are resulting in uneven economic advantages for coffee growers and lower quality coffee for consumers.

A delightful little essay for constitutional pedants, legal pedants and those who want to know what the Logan Act when it is mentioned, which is frequently. A law honoured in the breach 




 SUBMISSION STATEMENT

A nice summary of the case against performance reviews, and in particular how they are often badly run by people who focus on the negative rather than act as cheerleaders.

Peter Drucker argued that the task of a manager is to make strengths productive. I find the performance reviews focuses are not what you're good at, but what your bad at. 




 Rupert Murdoch's shifts with the political winds and is always sure to be the new best friend of the next Prime Minister. 




 I agree. I'm not a morning person. Let the morning, people drive to work in the dark. Might put a damper on that horrible cheerfulness they have at the breakfast table

 The demand for most cars above that of a small medium sedan could be explained by people wanting to drive and seen to be driving a big expensive car. They are status vehicles.

Male midlife crises would have no meaning if you couldn't buy an expensive sports car and drive it around 




 A hell of a lot of people of all ages like driving their cars. Also, driverless sports cars are a contradiction in terms.

For men, investing in a shiny red sports car or some other status display has advantages to them in the marriage and dating market 




 Explained about 30 years ago by Jacob mincer  the rate of depreciation on human capital during career interruptions is much higher in some careers rather than others.

For example, an IT scientist will be completely out of date, If they take four years off. If your specialty is history or literature, nothing much changes.

 Karl Popper observed that the motives of researcher don't matter. What matters is the quality of the critical discussion of what they have said.

Nice essay about how Boys are now being left behind are becoming the second sex  




 no progress at all!! 




 very true, especially during elections 




 Very interesting essay on the rise of women to the top of the corporate ladder.

The underlying research quoted in the paper shows that if you control for background (i.e. skills and talent) and exit (i.e. women staying in the workforce) women earn more than men and get more aggressively promoted than men in corporate ladders.

 Compensating differentials lives! 




 Indian curries are now the most popular foods in Britain so that was a gap in the article that was not mentioned. Also, that undermines your point about vegetarianism a bit 




 SUBMISSION STATEMENT

The latest oppressed minority is coming forward. Apparently a wage premium of 5-10% for full beauty in the labour market is not enough compensation. 




 Quite correct. There are some fanatics in it but a considerable number of opportunists too, apparently the majority fall into this category. 




 Thanks, perhaps the biggest worry is the political parties seem to be outbidding themselves into how hire the contribution rate can go.

There is no recognition that the maximum contribution you could possibly need for your retirement may have already been reached. 




 SUBMISSION STATEMENT.

A nice reminder of the 1960s and that the Apollo program was incredibly expensive for its time. Something that is forgotten in retrospect, especially when it's put forward as a rationale for further public investment in incredibly expensive science projects. 




 I actually disagree with the Australian system which I used to be subject to. 

First, people save far too much for their retirement. So much so, that they'll be wealthier in their retirement, if they make it that far, than they were during their working lives.

Secondly, there are required to save for their retirement before they have bought other basic things such as a car and a house deposit.

The practical upshot of the Australian system is that low paid workers save for their own retirement rather than rely on an means tested old age pension that would be funded by taxes on the middle-class. These low paid workers are in the peculiar position of having retirement savings but not enough savings to buy a house.

A surprising amount of analysis of Libya seems to suggest that we should dig up Col Gadaffi and putting him back in power or at least it was a bad idea that he was overthrown.

It follows that the employer will insist on such an agreement only if he believes that its value to him is greater than its cost to the employee The contract is designed, after all, with the objective of getting the other party to sign it."
