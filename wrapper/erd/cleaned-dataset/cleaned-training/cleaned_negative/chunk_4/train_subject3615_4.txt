 I doubt if the frontline doc included Thomas Drake's (et al.) letter--it was released January 2014 or so...

So, in addition to NSA Insiders' claiming the NSA obstructed the 9/11 Commission--we also have the Co-Chairs of the 9/11 Commision who claimed their investigation was obstructed by the White House and the CIA...Glenn Greenwald wrote an article in 2008: http://www.salon.com/2008/01/02/obstruction/

In fact, when former 9/11 Commission member Max Cleland was asked if there should be another 9/11 Commission, he said: "There should be fifteen 9/11 Commissions!!!"

http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2014/07/911-commissions-forum-shows-dc-works-4.html 









 there's nothing wrong with working at an apple store...but Thomas Drake was a legitimate whistleblower who was forced to incur huge legal bills while being stripped of his lifetime profession as an intelligence analyst...Thomas Drake is most likely making a fraction of the income/benefits that he was making inside the pentagon. In the end, if I remember correctly, Thomas Drake was forced to plead guilty to a lesser charge--just to make the case go away and take the stress and financial pressure of endless legal bills off.... 




 Thomas Drake was still FUCKED by the system--he is now working at an apple store (after a lifetime in u.s. intelligence)...so don't sugarcoat that shit they threw at him...

Full Letter: http://consortiumnews.com/2014/01/07/nsa-insiders-reveal-what-went-wrong/

------------------

"The sadder reality, Mr. President, is that NSA itself had enough information to prevent 9/11, but chose to sit on it rather than share it with the FBI or CIA. We know; we were there. We were witness to the many bureaucratic indignities that made NSA at least as culpable for pre-9/11 failures as are other U.S. intelligence agencies...

...My first day on the job at NSA was 9/11. I was immediately charged as the lead NSA executive to find and deploy the best technology at NSA for the fight against terrorism....

...Thats where I found the pre- and post-9/11 intelligence from NSA monitoring of some of the hijackers as they planned the attacks of 9/11 had not been shared outside NSA. This includes critical pre-9/11 intelligence on al-Qaeda, even though it had been worked on by NSA analysts. I learned, for example, that in early 2001 NSA had produced a critical long-term analytic report unraveling the entire heart of al-Qaeda and associated movements. That report also was not disseminated outside of NSA.

Make no mistake. That data and the analytic report could have, should have prevented 9/11...

...In short, when confronted with the prospect of fessing up, NSA chose instead to obstruct the 9/11 congressional investigation, play dumb, and keep the truth buried, including the fact that it knew about all inbound and outbound calls to the safe house switchboard in Yemen. NSAs senior leaders took me off the task because they realized  belatedly, for some reason  that I would not take part in covering up the truth about how much NSA knew but did not share.

When the 9/11 Commission hearings began, Director Hayden chortled at executive staff meetings over the fact that the FBI and CIA were feeling the heat for not having prevented 9/11. This was particularly difficult for me to sit through, for I was aware that NSA had been able to cover up its own culpability by keeping investigators, committees, and commissions away from the truth."

 I pointed this out on wednesday...in my own softspoken style 

http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2x4ke5/anyone_notice_it_wasnt_a_local_chicago_news_paper/ 




 I first watched this over a year ago...now it seems even more true--especially the part about the "war on terrorisism" being FAKE...

http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2xizds/think_about_it_the_cia_was_most_likely_involved/ 









 For me, one of the most intriguing items I've come across is the fact that the CIA was most likely involved in the planning of the World Trade Center--going all the way back to before 1960. This fact changes the manner in which the WTC complex should be looked at: as a CIA built asset which the Agency surely used in many ways unknown to the citizens and occupants of the WTC complex. It has shifted my thinking a bit towards Larry Silverstein being more of a victim than a planner. More importantly, by seeing the WTC as a CIA asset and creation--the questions about access to the WTC to pre-install explosives fades away. It inherently implies the WTC was a financial center for the CIA since the early 70's when the towers opened up, and that the destruction of the WTC complex may have been an intentional good-bye to financial records of the CIA from the 1970's on. We also know Enron had CIA connections and benefitted from the destruction of the WTC complex (which included the SEC office). Was Enron just the tip of the iceberg?

There is no doubt about the Rockefeller-CIA connections--but it is hard to come across articles which research this issue. I went thru the indexes of books by Peter Dale Scott, Michael Ruppert, Kevin Ryan, Russ Baker, Tim Weiner, Joseph Trento--not much there! Russ Baker did have an eye-catching paragraph which shows the power the Rockefellers had over the president of the united states:

----

(page 310, Family of Secrets)

Less well known is that David and Nelson Rockefeller used the takeover as a pretext to prevent the Iranian revolutionaries from withdrawing petrodollars from the Chase Manhattan Bank in London, where the shah kept most of his assets. According to several thoughtful accounts, the shah's looted billions were crucial to Chase's then shaky finances. Their withdrawal could have precipitated an international financial crisis. The hostage crisis then provided a justification for the Carter administration, under pressure from Rockefeller interests, to seize all of Iran's assets.

The only other bits and pieces I've found were from:

1) ["On the Trail of the Assassins" by Jim Garrison:](http://np.reddit.com/r/911truth/comments/2suotr/was_the_nyc_world_trade_center_created_by_the_cia/) One paragraph from this book started me thinking about this possibility...

 its definitely a tactic...they also do things to make searches difficult as well... 




 Lots of people will end up DEAD under U.S. bombs in Iraq as the defense industry executives celebrate by attending killer toy conventions in between rounds of golf with some generals...u.s. pilots will rejoice in their higher kill ratios and receive nylon award ribbons in a plastic display box to show off to their families how they flew a $100 million aircraft and dropped bombs on people who had no airforce...

if all goes as planned, the u.s. will have boots on the ground in Syria by the end of summer--and some psychopath at the cia will take photos over Assad's dead body as they attempt to identify whatever remains...YES, overthrow of Syria is the goal at the pentagon and the cia--they have been trying since 1949!!!

Michael Hastings quoted a 2008 RAND study which was interesting: they studied over 600 terrorist organizations since 1968--only 7% of the organizations came to an end via military action...43% of the groups came to a political settlement...40% were ended via local law enforcement-intelligence actions...another item Hastings brought up was what Gen. McChrystal called "Afghan Math"...if there are ten insurgents and you kill two--you may end up with twenty insurgents...so, 10-2 does not equal 8...10-2 equals twenty...yet, the u.s. persists in dronings and air strikes...

 I remember back in 2002 when Dick Cheney predicted the Iraq War would cost $85 Billion "if everything went well."

He was only off by a few TRILlION dollars.

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/9961877/Cost-to-US-of-Iraq-and-Afghan-wars-could-hit-6-trillion.html

 




 how many more Iraqis will lose their lives under u.s. bombs? the last estimate i saw counted over 3 million Iraqis dead due to u.s.-u.k. military actions and sanctions since 1990...how many more refugees will there be? what if things get out of control and the u.s. ends up with boots on the ground in Syria? it seems like this is all about overthrowing Assad to me. 














 don't worry--the u.s. will pay for some mercenaries, too...

...and we all KNOW this is just leading to an all-out invasion of Syria (and the overthrow of Assad)...the u.s., the pentagon and the CIA have been drooling over that!!! 




 So, you didn't realize that Cheney and Rummy split that missing $2.3 Trillion?  




 I remember when Shrimp Dick Cheney said the Iraq War would only cost $75 Billion--if things go as planned.

 Urban fighting is the most sophisticated, complex fight there is, Mr. Barbero said. Multidimensional. Its direct fire. Indirect fire. Precision fires. If you want to gain support from the occupants, the Sunnis, you cant go in there and just run with it. So it has to be a very, very precise application of firepower against an enemy that has no regard for the population and will indiscriminately use violence to hold on. Theres no way the Iraqi Security Forces will be ready for this kind of fighting.

 "It is every citizen's first responsibility to question the government."

--Ben Franklin, *Conspiracist* 




 good...after years of not having cable tv--my mind has finally erased those evil fucking bastards!!! 




 of course I wasn't implying the mayoral election isn't news--but I could literally scream from the number of times the front page has been infiltrated with Wrigley Field rehab updates instead of, say, how the Pentagon has Never submitted to an AUDIT...the Trib, the NYT, cnn, cbs, abc, nbc--they have all FAiLED to investigate and question--and given a Free Pass all too often...the "news" papers/media now resort to asking the DOJ before printing an article on Edward Snowden or the Patriot Act...the scariest thing is that Americans believe this vacuous reporting--at least in Russia the citizens know they are being lied to

and, YES, I would be happy to see the Chicago Tribune go OUT OF BUSINESS--the editors and publishers FAILED to protect the public interest long ago... 




 I grew up reading the Chicago Tribune...in 2nd or 3rd grade my school began a reading program where we read the paper twice a week...I have studied the de-evolution of the Tribune, how it has become a vacuous chatterbox for corporate interests and become nothing but an unofficial Propaganda Wurlitzer for the Pentagon. 

Sports is an entertainment that has become elevated to distract citizens from what is really important--the Tribune has regularly taken the top portion of their front page (which used to be devoted to "hard news") and used it to promote these vacuous "news" stories (mostly sports, sports, tv, movies and...sports)....

i would challenge you to take a sheet of paper and write down every Chicago athlete you know--MLB, NFL, NBA, etc...now write down every Chicago local, state or federal politician you know...which list is much, much longer? 




 i would urge you to quit giving the msm your business--even watching, viewing or reading them continues the cycle of disinformation which the msm has become accustomed to feeding its readers...even by watching cnn, msnbc, abc, cbs (etc.) you are paying them to misinform you (the cable companies pay every channel a portion of your bill, the companies also gain ad revenue offf of their number of viewers)...the corporate msm has failed to be the 4th estate, they have failed to seek the truth and bowed to their corporate masters...the Trillions of dollars of the Iraq-Afghanistan Wars have become more important than reporting actual facts...

 




 the guardian--all the way from England...(they have NYC office, too)

someone kindly posted a link below... 




 First of all, the "news" has become limited to issues which do not question the government. Take for example, the Iraq War and the "Free Pass" the u.s. press gave Bush-Cheney. The publishers and editors have decided they will not upset the readers with stories which make the readers Think...the Chicago Tribune, on a daily basis, updates its readers with sports, tv, movies ON THE FRONT PAGE...I would bet the Tribune has more sports writers than it has writers covering national security...what is REALLY news?  The Tribune has become just an unofficial u.s. state department-pentagon Chatterbox which simply regurgitates the latest press release and fails to investigate to uncover Real facts...

link to today's front page of the Chicago Tribune: 

http://www1.newseum.org/todaysfrontpages/hr.asp?fpVname=IL_CT ref_pge=gal b_pge=5 




 news is comprised of articles which affect the lives of the readers--political, economic, legal issues...

the Chicago Tribune, for the last decade, has devoted part of its front page to sports, movies, food, tv...its no wonder they didn't break this important story--the Tribune is too busy with sports and entertainment to have noticed...I would even bet that the Tribune has more sports reporters than it does Chicago news reporters...in any case, this story is just another example of how corporate u.s. media FAILS to seek the Truth and expose it...

 nice catch with the SK...certainly could be mindless rantings of someone who thinks he's Kim Philby... 




 1. is GROVER...what is it? a satellite or computer system that sweeps everything?

2. is the 3/4" audio tape from 1973: seems to be a reference to Nixon-era White House recordings--we know there was quite a bit erased from what was finally released to public...including a 10 minute segment

3. LOFTUS seems to be a computer

4. SR-91...what is it? a satellite? u.s. or russian?

fyi: u/SargeantForbin posted a slideshare which shows the original cryptome link (below)...it wasn't a capture of the wapo page--it was just a re-typing of the comments by BillCaseyHoneyPot

 




 thanks for pasting...i'm surprised this didn't get more upvotes--pretty friggin' crazy!!! 




 supposedly, ISI helped set that up...the ISI chief was in Wash, DC on 9/11 with PorterGoss, Bob Graham...after 9/11 an article from India pegged the ISI chief as having a money trail to one of the hijackers--so the ISI chief stepped down...

 i'm just half-way thru the book...but in 1951 the defense budget was $13.5 billion...in 1953 it was $50 billion...the Airforce also demanded fleets of planes for the nuclear weapons as well...by the mid50's the u.s. was capable of keeping 1/3 of its B-47 and B-52 fleets in the air at all times...(made possible thru air refeuling)...the u.s. had hundreds of air refueling planes...this was done in case the u.s. should be attacked by by russia with nuclear weapons--the u.s. could only assure a response if planes were in the air...
so you could definitely say, the u.s. military doesn't give a damn about the environment...we are still dealing with nuclear waste storage problems--which the corporate media won't cover (its in new mexico)... 









 the world trade center was created by the CIA and David Rockefeller...WTC 1 and WTC 2 had asbestos problems and were expendable--more useful as a modern Reichstag Fire than as the obsolete Two Front Teeth of America...WTC 7 contained offices for the CIA, the Secret Service and the SEC...see r/911truth for a link to "The New Pearl Harbor" (the best documentary on 9/11--the final two hours cover the Twin Towers)...

America Has Been At War 93% of the Time - 222 Out of 239 Years

 (page 206)

After completing the new manual, Patreus gets picked to return to Iraq to put his revamped theory to the test. He asks for twenty thousand more troops and gets them, increasing the overall number of forces  in Iraq to a hundred and fifty thousand, or a 15 percent increase. What follows is eighteen months of brutal fighting, at the cost of over one thousand American lives and over ten thousand Iraqis killed. Behind the scenes, McChrystal, operating his own Phoenix-like Special Ops program, wipes out "thousands," according to McChrystal's deputy, Major General Bill Mayville, noting that "jSOC was a killing machine." Violence does, however, eventually decline, and Patreus--and counterinsurgency--is able to take credit for creating the conditions for a face-saving withdrawal. COIN, it appears, is fully vindicated. The surge becomes a modern military myth, one eagerly embraced in Washington by those in the media and political world who'd been complicit in starting the Iraq War.

A closer inspection of the surge myth reveals a murkier set of factors. One of the major turning points in the war is in Anbar province, when local tribal leaders decide to turn against Al Qaeda. This starts happening a year before Patreus returns to command and has little to do with American military strategy. Analysis crediting the turnaround in Anbar usually ignores the reason why Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) was able to establish a foothold there in the first place: American bungling for the first three years of the war. The tribal leaders welcomed Al-Qaeda to fight the American occupiers, but then realized they'd made a significant tactical error. Al Qaeda in Iraq eclipsed the American occupation in brutality and stupidity--as one tribal leader would say, he would have "worked with the devil" to beat Al Qaeda. The tribal leaders realized that they weren't just fighting the Americans--the new Shiite-led government in Baghdad was also keen to wipe them out. Faced with the brutality of AQI, coupled with a sectarian cleansing campaign originating from the highest levels of the new government in Baghdad, the tribal leaders, mainly Sunnis, make a desperate play: They tell the Americans that for the right price, they'd partner with them. American soldiers start to hand out bags of cash to insurgents--about $360 million spent in just one year. Overnight, former enemies who had killed Americans for three years became "freedom fighters." ("They are true Iraqi patriots," as one American general will describe his former enemies.) We find a way to buy off the enemies we'd created by invading--the strategy is akin to digging a hole in the desert, then filling the hole with cash and dead bodies and calling it a victory.

Jake came up to me. "We'll hunt you down and kill you if we don't like what you write," he said. "C. will hunt you down and kill you."

[note: Jake McFerren is General McChrystal's top civilian political advisor responsible for helping foster international relations with the 44 coalition countries involved in Afghanistan. Jake was also McChrystal's West Point roommate and drinking buddy....C. was a member of the SAS, the most elite British commando unit]

-----

(page 88)

"Sorry about threatening to kill you," Jake said. It was the first time anyone in the group had acknowledged the blowout on Friday night. 

"Yeah, geez, the guy is just trying to do his job," McChrystal said. 

"No worries. Like I said, it happens all the time, but yeah, you're probably the highest rank to do so," I said.

I laughed, and they didn't.

(page 73-74)

Over the past year, journalists had regularly been given intimate access to McChrystal and his staff.  A reporter for the New York Times spent a few days in Kabul with him, producing a profile that found McChrystal's only fault was that he worked so hard, "he sometimes affords little tolerance for those who do not."  He described his running habits: "eight miles a clip, usually with an audiobook at his ears."  A writer for the Atlantic had enjoyed a good stay, writing an article titled "Man Versus Afghanistan."  He asked if McChrystal was Afghanistan's only hope. He found reason to believe: "eight miles a day, eating only one meal a day, and sleeping four hours a night--itself expresses an unyielding, almost cultic, determination."  Time magazine had put him as runner-up for Person of the Year, opening with an anecdote about a competitive "eight to ten mile" run he had with General Patreus. 60 Minutes spent the most personal time with him: He allowed them to film while he was jogging around the base. They'd all told the same story:McChrystal as a modern combination of saint and ninja, a "Jedi Knight," as Newsweek called him. 

-------

(page 75)

As a country, we'd changed since Vietnam--the ghost McChrystal and his generation of military leaders desperately wanted to exorcize. The fear that their wars, too, could end in disgrace: "It's not going to look like a win, smell like a win, or taste like a win," Major General Bill Mayville, McChrystal's director of operations, would tell me. "This is going to end in an argument." An argument they were determined to win. One of the first books McChrystal read after arriving in Kabul was Stanley Karnow's "Vietnam: A History."  McChrystal called the author to ask if there were any lessons that would apply to Afghanistan.  "The main thing I learned is that we never should have been there in the first place," Karnow reportedly told him. It wasn't what the general wanted to hear.

-----

(page 76)

The lesson our leaders took from Vietnam was not, it turns out, how to avoid another Vietnam.  It was how to seal off the horror: to ensure that only a small group felt and saw it. An all volunteer military, and a further reliance on the most elite, specialized soldiers to do the nation's work we prefer to ignore.  Entering houses at midnight and shooting unarmed men while they sleep. A widespread acceptance of drone strikes, killings committed by remote control--McChrystal watched a man on a videofeed in his headquarters for 17 days before he ordered the strike on a compound to kill Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. He went to see the dead man's body: the pictures of the corpse were displayed at a press conference, a modern day version of putting a man's head on a spike.

------

(page 110)

I had downtime to digest the reporting. A question persisted: What was the motivation behind McChrystal's decision to have me tag along? Was it that Rolling Stone would reach a demographic of young officers and recruits they wanted to impress? Would it confirm the view that the team held of McChrystal--that he was a "rock star," as they regularly called him? Dave explained that Special Forces operators had a healthy disrespect for authority; Rolling Stone fit this self-styled image perfectly. They were building Brand McChrystal--ballsy, envelope-pushing, risk taking. New York Times Magazine cover? Done. Time cover? Done. Atlantic cover? Too easy. 60 Minutes profile? No worries. Rolling Stone? Boom. It was a natural evolution of a very aggressive media strategy to establish McChrystal as a contender for the greatest general of his generation, on a par with Patreus.

(pages 142-143)

Insurgents are Afghans. What is essential for success is not to kill the insurgents, because they are the Afghan people. If you kill the insurgency, you kill the Afghan people you came to protect, and there's nobody left to win over. 

If you kill two out of ten insurgents, you don't end up with eight insurgents. You might end up multiplying the number of fighters aligned against you. McChrystal calls it "Insurgent Math." If you kill two, he said, "more likely you're going to have something like twenty. Those two that were killed, their relatives don't understand that they're doing bad things. Okay, they think. a foreigner just killed my brother--I got to fight them."

Afghan Math: 10  - 2= 8 (wrong)...10 - 2= 20 (right)

-------

(page 205)

The manual performs a rather impressive sleight of hand: tying counterinsurgency to the War on Terror. The vast majority of the fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan is not against any combatant who poses a threat to the United States homeland. But to justify the tremendous outlay of resources and lives it requires to enact a counterinsurgency plan, the theories claim that COIN, somehow, is an effective way to deal with transnational terrorist groups like Al-Qaeda. That this is patently false does not give the movement much pause. A RAND study "How Terrorists Groups End," commissioned in 2008, explicitly points out that the best way to defeat terrorist networks is not through military force, but through law enforcement. The authors looked at 648 terrorist groups that were active from 1968 to 2006. In 40 percent of the cases, policing is "the most effective strategy," with local intelligence and police agencies able to penetrate and disrupt the terror groups, while 43 percent reached a political accommodation with the government. The study states: "Military force led to the end of terrorist groups in 7 percent of the cases," and that military force has not "significantly undermined (Al-Qaeda's) abilities."

 The Guantanamo Bay lease is fucking ILLEGAL--any fucking judge in the USA would throw that lease out of court because it is a PERPETUAL lease (it has **NO END DATE**)... 




 YES...I do have a problem with allowing the CIA/U.S. military forces to be judge, jury and executioner for the people of the world.

YES I do have a problem when the CIA-US military KILL and KILL and KILL so corporations can PROFIT 




 Obama is responsible for the hundreds of drone strikes he has ordered around the globe..(each drone strike IS an act of war) 




 So what do you call it when the USA steals Guantanamo Bay from Cuba?

What do you call it when the USA overthrows the Queen of Hawaii and takes Hawaii?

What do you call it when the CIA pumps in millions of dollars to back political parties in Italy?

What do you call it when the USA bombs and bombs and bombs other smaller countries around the world?

 will most definitely check it out--thanks for taking the time to write the insightful comment...i've actually wanted to see that movie for quite a while...

 




 Was the NYC World Trade Center created by the CIA back in the 1960's???

I recently purchased a copy of "On the Trail of the Assassins" by Jim Garrison (1988 edition, paperback).  I knew the Oliver Stone movie was based on this book--so I was glad to part with the 25 cents the book was priced at.  I'm pretty familiar with the JFK whack job, so there wasn't anything too surprising until I got to page 100--the last paragraph reads: 

According to these articles, the CIA--which apparently had been conducting its own foreign policy for some time--had begun a project in Italy as far back as the early 1960's. The organization, named the Centro Mondiale Commerciale (the World Trade Center), had initially been formed in Montreal, then moved to Rome in 1961. Among the members of its board of directors, we learned, was one Clay Shaw from New Orleans.

So, the CIA seemed to be actively creating "World Trade Centers" around the globe so the CIA could conduct under the radar financial transactions. This money was going to back political parties in Italy--what other types of tranactions were being conducted? Very likely the CIA wanted these "World Trade Centers" for their ever-expanding series of front companies which often dealt with black market money from drug sales and arms dealing. Those of us who have read Peter Dale Scott (or some Michael Ruppert) are quite familiar with the accusations that the OSS/CIA have long-standing drug and mafia links going back to WWII. Possibly, the CIA very early on began to realize the illegal monies gained in the black markets were the easiest way to fund all of their other subversive activities--with the added bonus of NOT having any oversight by those pesky politicians (who don't need to know CIA business anyways). 

Interesting to note that the NYC WTC used eminent domain to take over the grounds on which the WTC would be built on--this could be assured with CIA backing. We know Rockerfeller had deep CIA connections. Agency man Phillip Agee claimed his first task in the CIA was to do background checks on employees of Rockerfeller's Standard Oil. Rockerfeller also had much to do with the planning of the WTC in NYC. Was the NYC WTC, from the beginning, designed as a CIA front? 

The biggest reason Jim Garrison lost the Clay Shaw trial was because he counldn't definitively link Clay Shaw and the CIA. We now know that Clay Shaw was, in fact, heavily involved with the CIA. After Clay Shaw's death in 1974, Richard Helms was called before the House Sub-Committee on Assassinations and testified that Clay Shaw was involved with the CIA. "On the Trail of the Assassins" also goes on to show the CIA creating Centro Mondiale Commerciales around the globe in the early 60's--I can just imagine Allen Dulles traveling and contacting his endless supply of men like George De Mohrenschildt and Clay Shaw...the book also notes how Clay Shaw's operation was shut down in Italy for "espionage activities" in 1962. So, the CIA knew these fronts were risky and must be considered expendable at a moments notice.

You may also be able to view pages 100-104 of Jim Garrison's book on google--it does give some more background...I would type the pages in but i am on my ipad travelling...

 The Pentagon spends BILLIONS of dollars every year on Public Relations...

So, it is certainly within reason that the Pentagon-CIA would make some distractions.

(Check Michael Hastings article where he states the Pentagon spends $5 billion per year on PR...it was in Rolling Stone...on my phone--otherwise i'd post link) 




 **CONTAGION**

That one word speaks volumes for how the Pentagon views any individual or group which does not support the political, economic and military goals inside the Pentagon/CIA. 

Anyone who has not yet read Tim Weiner's *Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CiA* or Stephen Kinzer's *Overthrow: America's Century of Regime Change from Hawaii to Iraq* should do so immediately.  
 




 May as well put a FOR SALE sign on the Statue of Liberty, too. 




 Good question--the CIA has an Inspector General who investigates within...In 2004 the IG CIA released a report--but its been such a long, convoluted, twisting story I have no idea if that report is the same as the 6,300 page 2009 Report...the 6,300 page report needed to be whittled down--so the Senate Select Cmte on Intelligence (SSCI) decided to pay CIA-approved attorneys $40 million to splice, dice and redact the report so it could be released to the SERFS of America. As a bonus, the SSCI gave the CIA-approved attorneys 4 years to do so. 

http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/torture_archive/index_ig.htm

In any case, this has been dragging on for over a decade. The first articles looking into systemic torture by the CIA-US military came out in 2002.

(awarded Presidential Medal of Freedom by GW Bush)
 




 I highly doubt that the all too complicit pack of Puppets which calls itself the US press allowed GW Bush just 4 questions and under 3 minutes of time in which to question the president on a regular basis. 




 It certainly could be that GWB was just a puppet put in place so Cheney could run his evil operations while GWB played it like a bumbling, innocent FOOL. 




 Even more frightening is the *executive power* which VP Dick Cheney carved out under the POTUS--the extreme secrecy and wide range of illegal actions was (partially) exposed in Barton Gellmans book *ANGLER: The Cheney Vice Presidency*. 

But, yes, I would definitely agree that it is insulting to Americans how much Bush/Cheney were able to keep hidden. Seems to be one of the larger ironies: 9/11 was the standard answer to everything, yet they couldnt stand in front of the public and answer questions under oath to the 9/11 Commission.  




 Pretty sure I saw the Crown or Pritzker (sp?) names caught up in the TAX HAVEN stories which broke out last year (and were overwhelmingly IGNORED by the establishment media). 

http://www.icij.org/blog/2012/11/offshore-world-allows-some-play-outside-rules 




 Opening Statement: The Vice President and I just finished a...a, um--a good conversation with the 9-1-1 Commission. It was wide-ranging. It was, uh, important. Uh, it was, uh, it was just a good discussion and I really, I appreciate the members, um...I want to thank the chairman and the vice-chairman for bringing the commission here...and, uh, giving us a chance to share views on different subjects...and they had a lot of good questions...and, uh, Im glad I did it, Im glad I took the time. Its an important commission, and its important that, uh, they ask the questions they ask so they can help make recommendations necessary to better protect our homeland. It was a--I enjoyed it. Let me ask--answer--a few questions...

-----------------

Interesting that GW Bush couldnt even complete his FIRST sentence: after he says the vice president and I just finished a... Bush pauses before he can find the right word. Bush can only use a very broad word to describe 
the conversation because Bush and Cheney were not placed under oath during the conversation. 

Interesting that Bush comes out by HIMSELF, without Cheney--is this designed to fool everyone? 

The other interesting bit of Bushs opening statement is that he shakes his head side-to-side (which means NO) before he says the words better protect our homeland.

GW Bush then goes on to answer 3 questions and rudely tell a 4th reporter that he already answered his question yesterday.

If the 9/11 Commission was so important--why did it take Bush so long to, Not Testify--but have a conversation" with them? Why is the press conference last only 5 minutes afterwards? Why are only 4 questions asked?

There are more interesting moments during the 4 Question Press Conference--what can you find?

----------

While I was trying to find the full press conference, I checked C-Span. First I searched for video Bush 9/11 Commission...here is what pops up: http://www.c-span.org/search/?searchtype=Videos query=bush+9%2F11+commission+

I then made my search more specific and searched for video Bush 4/29/2004--still NO GW Bush press conference!!!

WHY are they REMOVING this EVIDENCE from the record? (its available on youtube thanks to researchers like Jon Gold)...You can literally find thousands of GW Bush videos--but anything to do with 9/11 Commission seems to be missing INTENTIONALLY from the record...Isnt that what CRIMINALS do--remove or destroy evidence???
Anyone who has looked into this can see a much longer pattern of the Vice President and the President attempting to obstruct or disrupt the investigations looking into 9/11...

In addition to UNDERFUNDING the 9/11 Commission, the Bush-Cheney war criminals also acted quickly to Cover Up the evidence and impede any meaningful investigation...

+ The government shipped much of the WTC steel (aka the evidence) to China and India to be recycled ASAP (isnt that what criminals do--destroy evidence?)...

+ Within 10 days, the government was looking to pay off the victims relatives and forcing them to sign confidentiality agreements in order to receive money from the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund...the families were also given a strict deadline in which to make their decision.

+ Dick Cheney asked Sen. Tom Daschle NOT to investigate 9/11 on several occasions. (Sen. Daschle was on the Joint Intelligence Inquiry into 9/11).

+ GW Bush wouldnt testify to the 9/11 Commission UNDER OATH and BEFORE THE PUBLIC (hes just the President--what did you expect?)...

+ The 9/11 Commission Co-Chairmen wrote an editorial in the *New York Times* claiming the investigation was obstructed by the CIA and the White House.



 









 I heard some guys brag about TORTURING people...do you want their names, too?

Dick Cheney seemed to be leading the pack... 




 GREAT point...The Gary Webb allegations have to be re-analyzed.

Never really thought about this before, but didnt the laws against marijuana come into play in 1937...2 years after alcohol was legalized.

The War on Drugs made our prisons madhouses and had extremely negative effects on many other countries as well... 




 Thanks--glad so many here in r/conspiracy liked it...it was my first use of imgur--have some kinks to work out, but will go to sleep with a smile on my face. 




 YES, the war profiteers couldnt figure out how to go back to a peace time economy--it seemed much easier to spread some fear to get the war machines turning again. The 6 paragraphs that Andrew Cockburn wrote were pretty shocking to read when I first came across them (linked above). 




 McClatchy (sic?) News reported these last spring--article was quickly taken down and an investigation into leaks ensued...somone copy/pasted to document cloud before the article was expunged... 




 Very sound argument, although I would go back a bit further--back to the 1947 National Security Act which renamed the War Department, centralized the military and created the CIA. There is quite a bit of evidence that the Cold War was played like a drum by the Pentagon and sent over the CIAs Wurlitzer...

One legislator who served on a congressional intelligence committee called oversight horrible and said that improving even the intelligence budget process would mean that somebody in Congress would have to die.


 




 I guess there used to be 8 Congressional Committees who handled different aspects of the oversight--it was cut back to just 2 Committees around 1980 I think--supposedly due to committee members leaking info. As for Congress doing its job--I came across this shocking quote:

-----------

Another senior intelligence official noted that oversight had deteriorated so much during his career that I dont even know what good oversight looks like anymore.[12] Overseers agreed. One legislator who served on a congressional intelligence committee called oversight horrible and said that improving even the intelligence budget process would mean that somebody in Congress would have to die.

Amy B. Zegart (2011): The Roots of Weak Congressional Intelligence Oversight 

http://www.hoover.org/sites/default/files/research/docs/futurechallenges_zegart.pdf

-----------------
 




 Any thoughts on the seemingly complete loss of Congressional Oversight of the intelligence agencies? (Runaway NSA, CIA spying on SSCI, FBI-NSA spying on Senator Frank Church, Barton Gellman reported in his book that Cheney receives NSA printouts on State Dept. officials, Russ Tice allegations, etc.)

 




 I wouldnt doubt it if my posts in r/worldnews (and other major subs) are eyeballed and brigaded (most likely by humans!). Techniques seem to be: downvotes, comments using negative language which have nothing to do with my comment, stacking comments above mine which results in my comment being pushed down, the entire article/post being erased by mod or user...

Of course this isnt happening every time I post a comment or link--but one day I think these techniques were used on me in 3 consecutive comments I made. A large part of it is the subjective enforcement of the rules which the mods in the larger subreddits censor the articles with. 

Articles questioning authority (Pentagon, CIA) seem to be stricken from the record. I feel this is dangerous--imagine if the MSM had allowed more voices of dissent in the run up to the Iraq invasion in 2003. 




 Thanks for the info--Im just making my way thru Alfred McCoys *A Question of Torture* which reviews the history of the CIAs interrogation/torture experiments. I dont ever remember hearing about the Capitol building incident from 1983...WOW.

I read Beverly Gages book *The Day Wall Street Exploded* last year. She included Notes on Sources which is quite detailed and clear in that she was Shut Down in her attempt for new info the US government had on the 1920 Wall Street bombing. Gage did recently strike some GOLD though--a few weeks ago the *NYT* published her article on how she found the UNREDACTED FBI-MLK Suicide Letter. (She found it at the National Archives while doing research on J. Edgar Hoover) 




 Sprey was right about nations walking away from the F-35...last week, the UK just placed another huge" order--for FOUR more F-35s (Ill bet they would order LESS of them if they could)...

 sounds beyond my ability--it would be an interesting analysis which might reveal the larger subreddits have lost diversity of voices. Voices which criticize the US military-NSA-CIA seem to have been left out. If we had listened to more of these voices of dissent maybe, just maybe, the US would have never invaded Iraq in 2003. 




 is there a way to analyze r/news or r/worldnews submissions? itd be interesting to see the growth of larger media after the Snowden story broke...

 Buckley was on the debate team at Yale, so YES he's formidable. I definitely found some of his statements to be wild--youre 100% right about the I dont care who killed Kennedy statement. 

It appears to me that Buckley used his into of Mark Lane to paint him with the Left Liberal corner. Buckley then asks his first question: 

-------------

WB: Id like to begin by asking Mr. Lane this: it is widely alleged that sinister forces who have a vested interest in suppressing the real truth as to the identity of the assassin have been here and they are killing off crucial people--former strippers at Rubys joint in Dallas, a truck driver, roommates of Oswalds--that kind of thing. How come if you were the man who has changed history, these forces havent bumped you off?

---------------

*have been here* 

HERE seems very out of place.

Buckley is obviously working with notes--this seems an outlandish question to open the interview with. I think Buckley was trying to knock Mark Lane off balance from the start. Didnt work!! 




 Ive watched this 4 or 5 times now--each time through I notice more. Youre definitely spot on about Buckleys darting eyes--it looks like he intends physical harm to Mark Lane at some points (on the split screen). 

Not familiar with the NLP reference--but surely it makes an impression when Buckley mentions the Soviets, then physically acts out pressing a button--then goes on to mention Oswald and he (Buckley) holds out his hands as if he was shooting a rifle. 

There are also points where Buckleys EARS move--I think this may be from tightening the jaw...is this a sign of anger?

Never knew about Mark Lane getting caught up in the Jonestown mess.

Havent watched the Baldwin-Buckley debate yet. It is worth mentioning that the U.S. painted communism/socialism as an Evil Menace in a much more pronounced and effective manner than in England. Many of the labor strikes of the early 20th century blamed the violence on socialists. There was also the [Wall Street bombing of 1920](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_bombing) which was blamed on socialists--with very little hard evidence. In fact, in 2009 a Yale American History professor, Beverly Gage, wrote a book about the incident--and was unable to get any additional files released for her book--almost 90 years later. 
 




 [William F.Buckley, Jr.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_F._Buckley,_Jr.): Skull   Bones at Yale--where he was also an informer for the FBI...in 1951 Buckley was recruited by the CIA and worked with E. Howard Hunt--including 1 year in Mexico City...founded the *National Review* in 1955...

http://spartacus-educational.com/JFKbuckleyW.htm

-------------------

Be great if someone could help make some observations and analyze their meaning...

Within the first 7 minutes Buckley also impersonates Oswald and holds out his hands like he has a rifle and shoots it...

 Never heard about these pre-9/11 raids either...

-----------------------

September 5-8, 2001: Raid on Arab Web Hosting Company Precedes 9/11 Attacks  

The US Joint Terrorism Task Force conducts a three-day raid of the offices of InfoCom Corporation, a Texas-based company that hosts about 500 mostly Arab websites, including Al Jazeera, the Arab worlds most popular news channel. [GUARDIAN, 9/10/2001; WEB HOST INDUSTRY REVIEW, 9/10/2001] Three days after the initial raid, the task force is still busy inside the building, reportedly copying every hard disc they could find. It is not clear how long these websites remain shut down. [GUARDIAN, 9/10/2001] InfoCom began to be seriously investigated by the FBI in late 1998 when the name of an employee was discovered in the address book of bin Ladens former personal secretary. There also was evidence of a financial link between InfoCom and a top Hamas leader (see October 1994-2001). InfoCom is closely connected to the Holy Land Foundation. Not only are the two organizations across the road from each other in Richardson, Texas, a number of employees work at both organizations. For instance, Ghassan Elashi is both the vice president of InfoCom and chairman of Holy Land. [GUARDIAN, 9/10/2001; NEW YORK TIMES, 12/20/2002] A local bank closes Holy Lands checking accounts totaling about $13 million around the same time as the raid on InfoCom, but Holy Lands assets are not officially frozen by the government. [DALLAS BUSINESS JOURNAL, 9/7/2001] The US will shut down Holy Land and freeze their assets two months later (see December 4, 2001) for suspected ties to Hamas. Holy Land is represented by Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer   Feld, a Washington, D.C., law firm with unusually close ties to the Bush White House. [WASHINGTON POST, 12/17/2001] 




 Millions of Americans watch crime dramas and reality crime shows every night...but ask questions about the biggest crime in American history and youre a Conspiracist...

+ Never mind the fact that the government shipped the evidence to China and India to be recycled ASAP (isnt that what criminals do--destroy evidence?)...

+ Never mind that experienced pilots say they couldnt have flown a 757 or 767 into the WTC at the speeds the FAA tells us the planes were flying at...

+ Never mind that, within 10 days, the government was looking to pay off the victims relatives and forcing them to sign confidentiality agreements in order to receive money from the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund...

+ Never mind that there are over a dozen firefighters who will tell you they heard multiple explosions at the WTC...

+ Never mind that Dick Cheney asked Sen. Tom Daschle NOT to investigate 9/11 on several occasions. (Sen. Daschle was on the Joint Intelligence Inquiry into 9/11).

+ Never mind the fact that GW Bush wouldnt testify to the 9/11 Commission UNDER OATH and BEFORE THE PUBLIC (hes just the President--what did you expect?)...

+ Never mind that the 9/11 Commission Co-Chairmen wrote an editorial in the *New York Times* claiming the investigation was obstructed by the CIA and the White House.

 Imagine being shackled, your head is covered with thick black plastic so you cant see, you are then transported like cattle to another country, placed in a small room (or even a box) in which strange, intense loud music was played, the temperature may be drastically changed--if youre lucky they take you out for an hour per day, but maybe they leave you in there for 48 hours...After a certain period you begin to lose track of time as your senses shut down and your brain malfunctions into a state of shock. Maybe they feed you with enormously oversalted food and give you 1/2 glass of water. This is all legal because they havent caused your body physical harm!!!

Obviously, Im not saying that every prisoner at Guantanamo was treated this severely--but all of them were transported in shackles, with blacked out goggles on and most likely endured sleep deprivation, loud noises and other degradations...Prolonged exposure to these methods often cause severe mental trauma (sometimes in 48 hours).

The book [*A Question of Torture: CIA Interrogation, from the Cold War to the War on Terror*](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0805082484/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_dp_ss_3?pf_rd_p=1944687542 pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1 pf_rd_t=201 pf_rd_i=0299234142 pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER pf_rd_r=1EVRY4N9N3Z7RFCJR2YD) (by Alfred W. McCoy, 2006) goes much further into the issue, beginning with research the CIA funded in the 50s--much of it conducted in U.S. universities and hospitals. The doctors even published their research in medical journals afterwords.
At one point in the 1960s, the CIA made their rookies be subjected to these methods and a large portion of them couldnt finish the treatment (I think it was a week long).

What most people dont understand is that the U.S. military trained Iraqi police/militia forces in torture methods after the U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003. [The guardian made a documentary](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/06/pentagon-iraqi-torture-centres-link) last year centered around a U.S. officer named James Steele and his direct ties to Donald Rumsfeld. One has to question if teaching torture methods to Iraqis helped fuel the extremely horrifying headlines we saw from Iraq about large numbers of bodies being found beheaded. Most likely this was a back-and-forth, but I think that training, funding and feeding this type of torture program likely has much to do with the growth of ISIS and their brutal methods. The U.S. didn't just commit torture--the U.S. outsourced torture which may have helped feed the extremely vicious cycle of bloodbath after bloodbath. 




 Mark Mazzettis book *The Way of the Knife* covers quite a bit of Afghanistan/Pakistan--not sure if it specifically covers kidnapping/renditions. You can find a free pdf of the book at [r/TSBD](http://np.reddit.com/r/TSBD/) (Texas School Book Depository)--its #7...from index:

theres also a book *Monarch: The New Phoenix Program* which mostly covers Vietnam era operations--what happened in Afghanistan may have had its roots in the operations from the 60s and Central America in the 80s...heres a free pdf of the book by Philip Marshall: https://archive.org/stream/MonarchTheNewPhoenixProgram_441/Monarch#page/n1/mode/2up

Philip Marshall also did a book about Iran-Contra with Peter Dale Scott which is posted at r/TSBD (its #10)


Other authors to do keyword searches on would be Jeremy Scahill and William Blum + kidnapping + Iraq/Afghanistan + JSOC... (etc)

also try searching on wikileaks--they released tons of info on Guantanamo, Iraq, Afghanistan (most of which wont pop up on fucking google) 




 Im just starting to read one of Alfred McCoys books which begins with a brief history of the CIA research programs of the 1950s--scary fucking shit these CIA-funded doctors did with their research. Worst of all is the way the CIA attorneys squirm out of human rights agreements and then go on to bend and twist the meanings of words so the methods used arent considered torture. 

Imagine being shackled, your head is covered with thick black plastic so you cant see, you are then transported like cattle to another country, placed in a black cell (or even a box) in which strange, intense loud music was played--if youre lucky they take you out for an hour per day, but maybe they leave you in there for 48 hours...After a certain period you begin to lose track of time as your senses shut down and your brain malfunctions into a state of shock.

 thanks...looks like there are quite a few good candidates 




 I dont know why Roger Stone gets downvoted into oblivion...the last article I saw he said that the CIA considered whacking Nixon on 2 different occassions--which would actually gel with many others (such as Russ Baker) who theorize that Watergate was just a CIA operation designed to take Nixon out of office. Wish Russ and Roger would chat for an hour or two and post on youtube!!! 




 Thanks--glad you liked r/TSBD--its pretty much set up as a reference tool. 

I would definitely look forward to trying to get some authors, activists and/or documentary film makers for AMAs...r/conspiracy has grown from 75K to over 260K in the year and a half since I joined reddit. I think an achievable goal should be to have at least 2 AMAs every month by January.  




 Id love it if GG and JR chatted once a month...wish GG would start a once a week interview show (it must be nice for him to not be attacked) 









 Yes, its scary what the U.S. has done to Mexico, Central and South America while fighting the fake War on Drugs. I have also come to realize that the U.S. media has negatively effected my perception of people from the Middle East. As a child the media coverage of the Iran Hostage crisis greatly impacted my views about Iranians. Its only been more recently that I have been able to understand that the hostage crisis was actually blowback from the CIA 1953 coup detat in Iran. Not sure when the CIA files actually began to come out--but Im pretty sure that was never mentioned on *Nightline* (which began airing to give late night coverage of the hostage crisis). 

I guess the movie about Gary Webb is experiencing turbulence--I saw an online petition to pressure the studio (either they have shelved it or are cutting out parts). Even though its just a movie, I hope it gets released...I read in James Risens book *State of War* that NSA director Hayden actually watched *Enemy of the State* (with Will Smith)...(for some reason cryptome took the first page of chapter 2 out) http://cryptome.org/nsa-program.htm 



















 

the editor of consortium news worked for the AP and helped expose Iran-Contra...

As one of the reporters who helped expose the Iran-Contra scandal for the Associated Press in the mid-1980s, I was distressed by the silliness and propaganda that had come to pervade American journalism. I feared, too, that the decline of the U.S. press corps foreshadowed disasters that would come when journalists failed to alert the public about impending dangers.

Also by 1995, documents were emerging that put the history of the 1980s in a new  and more troubling  light. Yet, there were fewer and fewer media outlets interested in that history.

E. Snowden: I take the threat of terrorism seriously, and I think we all do. And I think its really disingenuous for the government to invoke and sort of scandalize our memories, to sort of exploit the national trauma that we all suffered together and worked so hard to come through to justify programs that have never been shown to keep us safe, but cost us liberties and freedoms that we dont need to give up and our Constitution says we should not give up.

B. Williams: But you can see how it happened. Guys with box cutters spent $200 using our own aviation system to take down our own buildings and smash into the Pentagon and a field in Pennsylvania. What are we going to do? Its a non-traditional enemy  the expression is, an enemy we cant see. What are we going to do?

E. Snowden: You know, and this is a key question that the 9/11 Commission considered. And what they found, in the post-mortem, when they looked at all of the classified intelligence from all of the different intelligence agencies, they found that we had all of the information we needed as an intelligence community, as a classified sector, as the national defense of the United States to detect this plot. We actually had records of the phone calls from the United States and out. The CIA knew who these guys were. The problem was not that we werent collecting information, it wasnt that we didnt have enough dots, it wasnt that we didnt have a haystack, it was that we did not understand the haystack that we have.

The problem with mass surveillance is that were piling more hay on a haystack we already dont understand, and this is the haystack of the human lives of every American citizen in our country. If these programs arent keeping us safe, and theyre making us miss connections  vital connections  on information we already have, if were taking resources away from traditional methods of investigation, from law enforcement operations that we know work, if were missing things like the Boston Marathon bombings where all of these mass surveillance systems, every domestic dragnet in the world didnt reveal guys that the Russian intelligence service told us about by name, is that really the best way to protect our country? Or are we  are we trying to throw money at a magic solution thats actually not just costing us our safety, but our rights and our way of life?

Former NSA Officers Thomas Drake, William Binney (et al.) Accuse U.S. Government of 9/11 Cover Up

"The sadder reality, Mr. President, is that NSA itself had enough information to prevent 9/11, but chose to sit on it rather than share it with the FBI or CIA. We know; we were there. We were witness to the many bureaucratic indignities that made NSA at least as culpable for pre-9/11 failures as are other U.S. intelligence agencies...

...My first day on the job at NSA was 9/11. I was immediately charged as the lead NSA executive to find and deploy the best technology at NSA for the fight against terrorism....

...Thats where I found the pre- and post-9/11 intelligence from NSA monitoring of some of the hijackers as they planned the attacks of 9/11 had not been shared outside NSA. This includes critical pre-9/11 intelligence on al-Qaeda, even though it had been worked on by NSA analysts. I learned, for example, that in early 2001 NSA had produced a critical long-term analytic report unraveling the entire heart of al-Qaeda and associated movements. That report also was not disseminated outside of NSA.

Make no mistake. That data and the analytic report could have, should have prevented 9/11...

...In short, when confronted with the prospect of fessing up, NSA chose instead to obstruct the 9/11 congressional investigation, play dumb, and keep the truth buried, including the fact that it knew about all inbound and outbound calls to the safe house switchboard in Yemen. NSAs senior leaders took me off the task because they realized  belatedly, for some reason  that I would not take part in covering up the truth about how much NSA knew but did not share.

When the 9/11 Commission hearings began, Director Hayden chortled at executive staff meetings over the fact that the FBI and CIA were feeling the heat for not having prevented 9/11. This was particularly difficult for me to sit through, for I was aware that NSA had been able to cover up its own culpability by keeping investigators, committees, and commissions away from the truth.

Congrats--I see *SKYGATE* has 31,000+ views...has youtube ever taken it down? I have seen this happen to other films--they take it down to keep the number of times viewed LOW.

THANKS for speaking out and hope that it hasnt caused you trouble with your job/family. 




 Saw your film--thanks for the info...I hope more people take the time to watch it. It is pretty mind-boggling that the planes were exceeding the speed they are designed for and could still be driven with accuracy by amateurs.

Still uncertain who to believe about cellphones being able to make calls from 20,000-30,000 feet in 2001...Seems most likely the cellphones would be cut off in a short time frame or experience quite a bit of interference...What about the AirPhones on the planes? have you looked into it? 

also, I recently saw this 9/11 Commission memo which states that WH Deputy Chief of Staff Josh Bolten said that Dick Cheney ordered Flight 93 shot down. After Cheney confirmed the shoot down, he then called President Bush to let him know it was shot down on his (Cheneys) orders. (slide down to Page 4)

U.S. policy in Iraq, from 1990-2003, was about REGIME CHANGE.

Chemical weapons, biological weapons, nuclear weapons were all just used to strike FEAR into the U.S. taxpayers. The U.S. knew exactly what Saddam had because the CIA and Mi6 were pumping information from intelligence/satellite sources to the UN Weapons Inspectors.
