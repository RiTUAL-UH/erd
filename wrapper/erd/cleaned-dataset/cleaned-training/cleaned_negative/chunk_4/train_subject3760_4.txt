 His manager walked into the F1 paddock in Spain, was asked a respectful question, and answered it. 

How is that hassling the family on any level? 




 Pretty damning indictment of old Ferrari isn't it? I thought he had been kicked out, but I guess this changes my opinion. 




 That's usually how it works, they don't give it away for free, there is a payment of some kind involved but its often a promotional trade off.  









 The last tyre war wasn't very good for the drivers or the sport, so I'm not convinced thats a solution to a problem the sport has. 

Pirelli were asked to get us to three stop races, and they've done a pretty good job of meeting that target. Speeds always increase through time as the teams find engineering solutions to the constraints of the rules. 









 Higher than you'd think, its actually a relatively common occurrence - Brundle said something along the lines of 'we've all experienced that and learned the hard way to throw them clear of the car' toward the end of the Sky coverage.  




 Pretty amazing work from Merc save for Hamilton's balance issues.

Ferrari seem to have completely fluffed the upgrade cycle, left themselves with no idea what works and what doesn't, and not made the expected gains as result. 




 They were the first to press, its a direct quote from the manager rather than the paper, and you can find the same story with the same quote in dozens of other publications right now. 




 Read about any of the top driver deals over the last couple of decades, those are the common terms. Price range will be with the confines of the Vettel and Alonso deals, give or take performance bonuses etc.

Jenson was able to keep the BGP car because it was in his contract for example. 




 Increased wear = heat = expansion. They're bound to be using a material that keeps any expansion to a minimum but even a small amount could affect the seating of the gun on the wheel fastening. 




 Somewhere in the 120 - 140 million over three years range including performance bonuses, keep the trophies, keep any WDC winning car, media and sponsor work to a minimum - typical stuff for top drivers. 




 Looking at the media speculation Hamilton's team are seeking a deal similar to Alonso and Vettel, the Mercedes board seems to be choking on it a little bit. 




 And you won't, because both of those things are extremely unlikely given the type and severity of the injury.

Looking at the media stories there haven't been any similar quotes from her since December.  














 She said

"There are small improvements, but the road is still very long."

This a woman who is extremely close to the family and who has spent each day since the accident fending off almost any media speculation or stories about Schumacher. So for her to actually comment and say something positive (however small) is really good news.

With the type of injuries suffered by both Schumacher and Bianchi all you can really expect are (very) small improvements. A member of my family, sadly a child, suffered serious brain trauma and it took four years for any real progress to manifest itself. 



















 Try deleting the app downloading it again and restoring the subscription. This worked for me. 




 What kind of device do you have it on - are you relying on wifi or cellular data? 




 You have a source for that? I thought I'd seen his post drive chat with Button - was there an interview I've missed? 














 Ted K mentioned this in his [notebook](https://youtu.be/yufbj7NWojA?t=13m35s).  




 Since the potential field only includes people with 6 - 10 billion to spend I'm not confident there is a good solution. 




 IMO testing liveries don't count! 



















 They were all pretty huge, although the angle of the photo accentuates the size. I believe that at the time you had more choice of [rim size](http://www.smcars.net/attachments/formulas-png.81696/) because there does appear to be a wide vairiation amongst the cars of that era.

The innovation was the mounting of the engine at 3.5 degrees to assist ground effect - something [copied more sucessfully by the Ferrari F10](http://www.auto123.com/en/racing-news/f1-the-striking-1979-arrows-a2-that-inspired-the-2010-ferrari-f10?artid=115830). 




 He does, and he's had career long bad luck! 

But he's amazingly quick - the other guys at the front of the grid hadn't even hit puberty when Kimi got his first F1 drive. 







































 6th 




 You've missed the point of the entire discussion that was taking place. 




 True, but more recently the wind-tunnel issues demonstrated where their real problems lay. 

The engineers said we need a new 60% scale wind tunnel, management said make do with what you have. Basically the next four years were a write off! Management simply didn't understand the needs of the team - using alternative facilities whilst fixing their own basically cost five times as much.

It's one example, but it highlights the problem. The decision makers just didn't get it. 




 The whole reason that Schui was trying to bully his way past Wurz was that he wanted to chase Mika, he certainly thought he was in with a shot! Hakkinen made mistakes and had brake problems, if Schui could have put him under pressure then he might have forced an error.

Schui had start problems for years - it was one of the biggest problems in his early career and something he worked very hard on, especially after 1995.  




 Absolutely! For the first time in 30 odd years of watching I actually like the team. 

They seem to have finally addressed the internal power structure problems that have dogged them since the 90s - all it took was the racing team sinking the flotation. I guess these issues were easy to ignore when they were winning with Schumacher. 




 Well, it's killed a few engine components and had a credible attempt at munching on Maldonado. 




 6 points is almost half the deficit! That Ferrari also wasn't as good as the McLaren in fast corners and was hard on its tyres. He could have won Monaco had he shown more patience.

You also forget Schumacher stalled it on the grid in Japan before the puncture. As I said, if he and the Ferrari had performed better he would have sealed it, but the car let him down and he made too many unforced errors. The DC crash hurt, but he had plenty of chances. 




 You are correct on the points. But reliability really cost him, he had the championship in his own hands that year. 




 He finished the season ~~24~~ 14 points down. Arguably his over aggressive attempts to get past Wurtz at Monaco, two mechanical retirements, three thirds and a fifth cost him the WDC rather than anything DC did.

He and Ferrari had the championship in their own hands. 
























 I think the feeling was mutual, much like the antipathy between [Schumacher and Alonso](http://www.jamesallenonf1.com/2010/03/alonso-and-schumacher-renew-hostilities/). But taking Damon Hill out etc - he had an angry streak for a very long time. 

Even as late in his carrer in 2010 he almost put [Barrichello](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/8875352.stm) into the wall. 




 He was far from cool as ice in his younger days. Quite the hothead for a few years. 


































 Considering Ferrari fired Aldo Costa because Alonso lost the 2010 championship, and he went on to be the Engineering Director responsible for the W05 and W06, Mercedes might discover a sudden need for catering staff! 














 It is, but choosing a new engine, and having one blow up are quite different. 









 Fascinating read, thanks for that link!

 




 Several reasons:-

- Voting for this may allow them to make a deal on something they want now, or in the future.

- The extra engine might be helpful to Mercedes.

- Sporting considerations - everyone wants a competitive series.

- Having several teams able to test new engines (which may have upgraded components compared to race engines) allows Mercedes plenty of room for development and curing reliability issues.
 




 I doubt Ferrari are a serious factor in Mercedes decisions on this one because they seem to have good reliability, and Merc want/need the competition for the sake of the show. 

Its more likely that Mercedes would be influenced by their customer teams needs. Down grid, RBR and McLaren are a potential threat to Lotus and Williams - both teams where money plays a more significant role and data gathering is helpful (though not dramatically so). 



















 Thanks. I was beginning to wonder about him! 




 That's wide of the mark. His results look more like Alonso's than anyone else's - 2nd in the WDC four times, 3rd three times.

He was a *brilliant* driver just without that tiny little extra margin, and he hit his peak at the same time as Fangio which didn't help.  




  James Allison tried his damndest to keep Alonso

He and Alonso have a relationship going back to Renault, but [I always thought that](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/formula-one/22470411) it was Alonso that wanted Allison rather than the other way around.

James Allison starting at Ferrari on Sept 1 as chassis tech direc will likely help pacify a certain Spaniard today, bet the phone's been hot - Martin Brundle

Of course Vettel had a stated preference for Kimi.

Id prefer Kimi. I need to be careful now. Nothing against Fernando, I respect him a lot as a driver but I think I respect Kimi on track and off track because hes always been very straight with me and from that point of view it might be a bit easier. 




 Seb's always talked of being a Ferrari driver, even when he was in the German BMW formula, there is an interview somewhere but I can't lay my hands on the link.

Interesting though, I'd long suspected that Ferrari had an informal deal with Vettel [because of his relationship with Schumacher, and Schumacher's dislike for Alonso] that when he was ready to move they would open the door. This also confirms that Ferrari left Alonso rather than the other way around.  




 Ah, no worries! 




 Rabid?! I'm very fair and balanced when it comes to Rosberg ;o)

Although if you severed me in two I'm pretty sure that underneath Formula 1 it would read Senna - Mansell - Hill - Hamilton - Button, then England Rugby. 




 Stevenage is mostly a *very* middle class post war new-town (concrete and unpleasant). Its actually about an hour and a half away from London by road or rail. 




 Jeez what a mess! 














 That BMW's next test driver would be a 4 time WDC, and Alonso wouldn't win the championship in the next 8 years. 




 Haven't NASCAR implemented a similarly weird system now - only x number of races count towards the championship? 









 I only bothered to downvote because you were being an ass. 

GM School Bus Yellow is a shade of orange, not yellow, so you were wrong about that too. 




 Ferrari just seem to have pursued a completely different car concept. 

If I understand RBR correctly they relied on the short nose solution to deal with the turbulent air over the front wheels, couldn't get it through the crash tests, and the car is a dog without it. Hence their thinking that they will see major gains now they have it working. 

Ferrari appear to have focussed on unleashing last years aero-compromised engine, improving the suspension geometry, and getting the cooling right, rather than expending staff time and money on the nose. 



















 Nice work editing the original comment and then deleting and reposting your reply. As is obvious to you now the context wasn't clear, hence my response.

In actual fact one owner was told by a former McLaren mechanic to use ['GM School Bus Yellow'](http://paintref.com/cgi-bin/colorcodedisplay.cgi?style=print type=paint paint=79904 ditzler=2785 syear=1975 smanuf=GM smodel= sname=School%20Bus%20Yellow cols=simple rows=150) on his M6A - as you can see from the link it is the correct colour. 









 To Torro Rosso - CASIO, and Pepe Jeans to Red Bull but the links are all on the site that cannot be named!

His first team was BMW Sauber. He had a slightly unusual route into F1 through several German series, but I believe it was actually BMW that funded his test driver seat because they wanted a German driver for their own F1 team. Of course by the time he was ready they were pulling out. 









 Thing is I don't see that Hamilton is putting himself in the spotlight in the way you suggest. You can't have a relationship with a major celebrity and not be in the spotlight no matter how hard you try. If you look at what he puts on instagram or twitter its pretty standard fair 




 It was Ron's second F2 team, Project 4, that took over McLaren rather than the other way around. The MP4 designation [originally meant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren#Sponsorship.2C_naming_and_livery) 'Marlboro Project 4', and was later changed to mean 'McLaren Project 4'. This only goes to show how deep the relationship with Philip Morris was.

Even now their current logo is a [stylised version of the Marlboro Chevron](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--usxchzXG--/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_636/18z0w45eftossjpg.jpg) - because that's what they're most remembered for. 




 I was surprised! I knew Damon, Eddie Jordan (and I think DC) used to play pub rock together in bars after the races but I didn't know he'd recorded anything. 




 I think they only had two cameras and shared them around at each race - the damn things were so expensive back then. 




 Sorry. I was referring to his first F2 outfit Rondel Racing and the context wasn't clear - but you're correct, I got his age wrong, he was 26 at the time. 




 No problem - my context wasn't clear in any case.

My partner is Black as is my closest friend and as a result I've become more aware of the subtleties of racism, or what could better be described as racially motivated criticism, than I otherwise might have been. 

Much of the commentary directed at Hamilton carries a tone of 'otherness' with it - its seeking to highlight aspects of his character, tone, style, and personal behavior that are different than what is perceived to be the 'norm' if you see what I mean. If you want to undermine something you raise questions of validity and highlight things that are seen as outside the mainstream of opinion.

For example. You could say that 'Schumacher was a great driver, but not a great sportsman' - if you wanted to acknowledge the greatness but undermine the validity of his considerable achievements by attacking his character. 




 My example wasn't specific to Moss's comments - I had meant in general, sorry if that didn't come across. 

I'm also not labelling *any* criticism directed at Hamilton racist, much of it clearly isn't and I share your feelings on this. But, there is quite a lot flak sent in his direction over the gold chain he likes to wear, certain celebrity friends, flat peaked baseball cap, 'hip hop' (i.e. not specifically music but black music), etcetera. I do feel has a racial motivation behind it because, broadly, its highlighting behavior or ways of dressing that are common in the black community but not in others, and the tone of such commentary is always critical.

Equally when you compare the media and fan treatment of Mansell, Hill and Button (basically national treasures in this country) with the way Hamilton is spoken about the contrast is quite stark. Hamilton is arguably the most successful British racing driver ever to have hit an F1 track, yet the validity of his achievements is constantly questioned in a way that other recent British champion's haven't been. 




 Umm, the owners were Bruce McLaren and Bruce McLaren. In fact the first McLaren cars to appear in orange were their CanAm series cars, although they did make some customer cars for the series. 









 The point is that such things are used as a form of criticism of Hamilton, as /u/jimbodeeny demonstrated above when he said:

Probably something more like a racing driver Dan Blizerian than #blessed hip hop star Hamilton.

This kind of thing wouldn't be said in the same way about a white driver, its being used as a 'dog whistle' for less pleasant language and is clearly racially motivated. 

Damon Hill, for example, played guitar with George Harrison and Def Leopard while he was driving, in fact he appeared on the opening track of Def Leopard's 'Demolition Man' album. He and Eddie Jordan regularly played music together at post race events - this was never used as criticism at the time or since. 




 Schumacher [did not like Alonso](http://www.jamesallenonf1.com/2010/03/alonso-and-schumacher-renew-hostilities/) but respected him as a competitor. 




 Completely agree. 




 Yeah, it was interesting to learn Ferrari took a new engine for Bahrain. I don't think Mercedes are holding back, they're still learning the tyres and there is only so much power you can use at high temperature/humidity tracks without creating deficits elsewhere. RBR won with a relatively underpowered engine. 




 Yep. Its not good, and it makes me very sad. 

My grandparents lived into their mid-nineties and didn't say or believe things like this. Age doesn't make it acceptable to be sexist or racist - in my experience people who were remain so in old age. 




 Its good PR, makes some noise and collects a few column inches. 




 Nasr already has two junior championships a 2nd and two 3rds under his belt - those are better junior results than Rosberg (2 championships and one 2nd), and only one junior championship adrift of Schumacher (3 championships, one 2nd, one 3rd) at the same stage.

Yet he gets branded a pay driver? 




 Its the 'it's ok for old people to be a bit racist' argument. 

But it isn't. 

He's not dumb and he knows what he's saying is a long way out of touch with modern Britain. 




 In sheer terms of the number of F1 driver records held, the only people ahead of Hamilton (52) are Schumacher (100) and Vettel (72). 

He's already eclipsed Clark (36), Senna (37), Lauda (16), Prost (42), Mansell (29), Stewart (14), Fangio (37), Ascari (20), Hill (5), Hkkinen (17), Alonso (46) and many more. 

If that doesn't make him one of the great drivers of the sport then I don't know what does.  




 Yep. To be honest I'm disappointed in him, every time Moss opens his mouth on Lewis or women in motor racing something crass comes out. 

When people like the English Defence League are putting your quotes on T-Shirts you should wonder if your views aren't a little out of touch. 


"In those days we were proud to be English. It's different now, there's probably only about ten million of us Englishmen left. All the others have come in here from God knows where....."

On women in motorsport:

"We've got some very strong and robust ladies, but, when your life is at risk, I think the strain of that in a competitive situation will tell when you're trying to win. The mental stress I think would be pretty difficult for a lady to deal with in a practical fashion. I just don't think they have aptitude to win a Formula 1 race."
 




 That happened [yesterday](http://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/34szhw/arrivabene_why_do_i_need_hamilton_when_i_have/) 




 Being in a development program doesn't relieve young drivers of the need to bring sponsors with them into the program, or into teams at higher levels in the sport.  




 Lauda did the same thing! 



















 I agree. Team principal of his own F2 outfit at 26, and the most experienced team leader in the sport today. Always interesting to listen to what he has to say on matters. 




 22 years. Interestingly it was Emerson Fittipaldi that bought his personal sponsor Philip Morris to the the team and thats what led to the Marlboro McLaren livery and all that history. 









 Amazingly McLaren only used this livery for [four seasons](http://www.mclaren.com/formula1/blog/alan-henry/changing-face-mclaren-f1-car-liveries/) - yet its stuck in the fan consciousness.

The colour scheme was shortlived: McLaren only ran in orange F1 livery between 1968 and 1971, incorporated a notional orange streak into its Yardley-liveried cars of 72 and 73 and phased it out completely when Emerson Fittipaldi brought the full red-and-white might of Philip Morris Tobacco onboard when he joined for 1974.
 









 I thought he'd just lost the back on the straight, maybe hit some oil or a less grippy part of the track. As you say, odd.

Stunningly lucky marshall. 









 The more people know, the less happy they are. The curse of the information age. 




 Alcohol. Actually very common at the time, but has some [extreme downsides](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku7TdLeEGsQ) 




 You get that you're actually costing the teams money, not Bernie? He only has a 5% share, even the controlling interest amounts to less than 35% profit share.

60% of all FOM revenue goes to the teams, which last year amounted to around $1.2 billion net. 




 Cost 20, since I'm already paying 200 a year to watch the races, i threw down. I'm pleased with the results, its far from perfect, but a lot better than anything else Sky has to offer. 




 If you subscribed then it works on your tablet and phone, just hit restore subscription on your other device. 




 No, both driver and marshall survived. Bloody lucky the pair of them. 




 I seem to have created a monster.  









 I feel the same way about Bottas as I do about Magnussen, I just don't see them as contenders, their results on track don't seem to justify the hype. 

Anyone want to fill me on the cause of all the fandom? 




 The [video isn't any less terrifying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1pJo3sLpVk) than the photos.

Only yesterday I was pointing out that of the 29 regular drivers that started the 1968 season alongside Jacky Ickx, 13 died racing or testing in the 7 or 8 years that followed (though only a few in F1). Driving was a brutal career in those days.

They were: McLaren, Rindt, Clark, Solana, Schlesser, Rodrguez, Spence, Scarfiotti, Bianchi, Siffert, Bonnier, Courage, and Moser.

In May 1967 Bandini was racing at the Monaco Grand Prix, running second to Denny Hulme on the 82nd lap, when he lost control of his car at the harbour chicane. He had just entered an S-turn when his Ferrari's left rear wheel hit the guard rail, sending him into an erratic skid. It impacted a light pole and overturned. The car hit straw bales which lined the harbour side, rupturing the fuel tank, and sparks ignited the fuel as the car rolled over, with Bandini trapped beneath it. Marshals flipped his car upright and pulled Bandini, unconscious, out from the flaming Ferrari. It is thought that, during the effort to right the overturned car, gasoline leaked on the hot brake line or the exhaust pipe and exploded. A second fire occurred when the gas tank exploded after Bandini had been pulled away from the Ferrari.

Bandini's burns were extensive, with third degree burns covering more than 70% of his body. The worst burns were on his arms and legs with slight burns on his face. Doctors were forced to wait for twenty-four to forty-eight hours before resolving to move Bandini to a hospital in Lyon, France, which specialized in the treatment of burns. Other options considered, by the doctors, were flying in skin grafts from Italy or a specialist burns unit team from East Grinstead in England. The burns caused severe lesions. He also sustained a chest wound and ten chest fractures.

Three days later, Bandini succumbed to his injuries. He died at Princess Grace Polyclinic Hospital in Monte Carlo. There were concerns about the promptness of Bandini's rescue. However, investigators from the Principality of Monaco ruled on 10 May "that the security operation had functioned properly." The straw bales, having been banned from all Formula 1 races in response to the accident, were replaced by an extended guard-rail the following year.

Bandini was buried in Reggiolo on 13 May. 100,000 people attended the funeral. 




 Thank you, I've fixed that!  




 Mercedes dropping away, or other teams catching up on their development depending on how you view it, in general thats the long term effect of the rule changes on the engineering side. There is basically one or two good ways to get the best out of x rule inside x car concept, and the competition is to see who can find and balance that against the rest of the car more quickly.

According to legend Hamilton was convinced by the factory tour, just as Alonso was by the same thing at Honda. Both appear have felt the engineering commitment sufficient to put them in contention for wins.

30 odd years watching says you can never count Ferrari out (for the first time in those years I have a positive view of Ferrari), and they appear to be on track for a good 2016. Personally I don't take the potential move seriously - but you never know. 




 Schumacher, Hamilton, Alonso, Button and a whole lot more all went to teams less successful than their previous one. Its not about the current season its about the next 3 - 5 years.

Also its Ferrari, even Hamilton said that only a fool wouldn't consider driving for the most successful team in F1 history, no matter the circumstances.

- Schumacher to Ferrari (Ferrari 3rd, Benetton 2nd in 1995)
- Hamilton to Mercedes ~~(Mercedes 4th, McLaren 2nd in 2011)~~ (Mercedes 5th, McLaren 3rd in 2012)
- Alonso to McLaren (McLaren 3rd, Renault 1st in 2006)
- Button to McLaren (McLaren 3rd, Brawn 1st in 2009) 




 Tell that to Seb, and Schumacher. But you're missing the point of what I said. 




 Neither is more important than the other. If you want to watch a spec series, there are plenty to choose from. 









 I'm really looking forward to this race, especially as its around the corner. Nice price too. 




 I don't know. I wonder if they need to go back to the car concept drawing board, 2014 seems to have wrong footed them, its easy to blame the power unit, but their problems are self evidently more than skin deep. 

The engine installation seems to be off, mapping, brakes, balance, the car seems to be a dog. I also have to say that IMO the attitude of the team management is helping their cause at all, and it may be time for a change.

I do hope that you're right though. 




 Absolutely, but it appears to me that its the power delivery rather than than the bhp that is the real difference. Merc had by far the best power unit in the two years preceding 2014, but didn't have the chassis to match it. But they were focussing on 2014 and little else.

I'm not counting RBR out in the slightest and I believe they'll get a lot out of the B spec car, but I don't think they'll be racing at the front because of it. Will certainly enjoy finding out though. 




 I disagree. Even now, after 14 years driving, Kimi is one of the fastest drivers in the business, and has driven 40+ of the fastest laps ever achieved in F1 races - he deserves his seat. 

One year of bad performance doesn't erase his career. Especially when you consider he's racing three drivers who hadn't even hit puberty when he first got into F1. 




 I've sat through the same [expletive deleted] arguments about Hill/Schumacher, Mansell/Hill, Hill/Coulthard, Prost/Senna and dozens of other driver competitions and team pairings. 

You don't get to be a four time WDC winner and beat Webber consistently by accident.

Seb is a great driver, and I'm having a lot of fun watching he and Kimi race.  




 Indeed - that's what I mean - it appears that Ferrari chose to invest their time and money in other parts of the car rather than chase the short nose. You'd have to say that decision paid off for them.  




 According to your underlying theory Seb couldn't handle a bad car and his results suffered (which was still 5th in the WDC, not shabby at all by anyone's standards), but Riccardo could drive the same bad car to success because he's the better driver.

Hows that theory working out for you this season?  




 I'll bet Ferrari are holding their updates until after Monaco - the package they have right now seems well optimised for the hotter races and could do very well there, especially with their excellent cooling setup. 

Interestingly Ferrari don't seem [bothered by the short nose](http://www.espn.co.uk/f1/story/_/id/12622228/james-allison-explains-ferrari-nose-design). Red Bull were having issues with the crash tests and, I guess, built the car with that kind of nose in mind. Perhaps that's why they're expecting such large gains from it. Ferrari seem to created have a different car concept entirely, rather than investing a lot of staff time into a crash tests and such.

I do wonder if there wasn't a price elsewhere on the RBR car for getting the short nose done. 
























 Livery change confirmed. Hello Jennifer. 



















 I'd left Hulme out only because he lived to an age, even though he died racing, he survived his era so-to-speak. 

Obviously you're correct. I'd tried to phrase it so it was clear-ish (i.e. racing or testing without qualifying the series) that relatively few died in F1 cars but didn't succeed! It was commonplace, even expected, in that era to drive in multiple series though. 

Its an awful list, and that was just one season's drivers, almost all were dead before 1975. Sad. 




 I bet it's ultra contemporary , non cluttered

[Nope](http://virtualglobetrotting.com/map/ron-dennis-house/view/bing/) more castle like. 




 That's because SAP is a team sponsor, but they're one of a shrinking number, and only three of 10 teams on the grid have a title sponsor right now (Sahara don't count as they own 40% of the team).

What SAP specifically get is proof their cloud solution works in one of the worlds most data intensive professions, and their competitors in that field, Microsoft, also sponsor F1 extensively. But SAP's real involvement is with McLaren Technology group and their F1 and road car computer systems.

However none of that is what we're talking about at all. Sponsors are increasingly funding younger drivers as a low cost, high value, route into the sport. Santander for example funded young Alonso - he took their personal sponsorship to McLaren (and left them there, where they picked up Button), and to Ferrari, where he again left them. Maldonado bought in PDVSA who are major sponsors of his old team and new one. Teams very often give slots on the car to drivers management to place, and increasingly so. 




 Most of the drivers that competed alongside him died that way, in that era you had less than 40% shot at surviving your racing career. Many successful drivers walked away after a WDC win, not wanting to chance their luck any further.

Ickx, started in F1 1968. Of the 29 drivers that completed more than one race in that season 13 died racing or testing in the years that followed - 46% of them. They were McLaren, Rindt, Clark, ~~Hill,~~ Solana, Schlesser, Rodrguez, Spence, Scarfiotti, Bianchi, Siffert, Bonnier, Courage, and Moser. 

Edit: As /u/meowlong points out, not all of these drivers were killed in F1, but its worth saying that this is because it was commonplace at the time to race in multiple series. This isn't a comment on F1 safety specifically. 




 Yeah. Its tricky to find pictures because most of the race photos are black and white or so grainy the grey/silver looks white. But I beleive thats him! 




 Here's a shot of [Fangio driving the Mercedes W196](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_in_Formula_One#/media/File:Gro%C3%9Fer_Preis_von_Europa_-1954_N%C3%BCrburgring,_Juan_Manuel_Fangio,_Mercedes_(3)x.JPG) in the 1954 German Grand Prix. Fangio won two drivers championships with the team.

The 'Silver Arrows' name came from their domination of the old Grand Prix series in the 1930s, and they entered F1 in 1954 with Fangio switching from Maserati to join the team and immediately dominated the 54' and 55' seasons winning everything in sight. Sterling Moss partnered Fangio in 1955.

This should also sound familiar, past is prologue for Mercedes!

Sadly it was the Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR that [went airborne and killed 79](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMoh5hZAaZk) people after hitting the back of Lance Macklin's Austin-Healey at the 1955 Le Mans, their Magnesium Alloy body work increasing the severity of the post accident fire. The crash wasn't their fault, but they took the hit for it, and withdrew from all motorsport afterwards. 




 He can, but most vary rather than change. 

If you think that drivers have nothing to do with sponsors then you simply haven't been paying attention to how the sport actually works in this era. The whole point of sponsoring young drivers is to gain entry along with them to the top level of motorsport. 




 Yes you can. Changing liveries is connected to sponsors, which funds more and better development, ergo liveries do have an impact on performance. 




 I highly doubt it. Project 4 bought the McLaren team rather than the other way around, plus when you look back at the logos through the years its clear where the chevron came from

  Who owns the Hill helmet config?

Damon Hill - which is the point. The sport needs to improve driver branding, because that's the main method by which sponsors are coming to the sport these days.

It's ridiculous no matter what excuse you use.

Only if you have no idea how marketing actually works and how sponsors are coming to the sport.
 




 More people does not equal better work or more productivity, in fact the adding more people just delays projects further. See the [The Mythical Man-Month](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month). 




 It does today, but not [originally](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren#Sponsorship.2C_naming_and_livery). 




 They [altered the meaning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren#Sponsorship.2C_naming_and_livery) after Malboro left the team to McLaren Project Four, but it originally meant Marlboro Project Four (I beleive Marlboro funded the chasis development).

Even today the Mclaren logo is a stylised version of the [Marlboro chevron](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--usxchzXG--/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_636/18z0w45eftossjpg.jpg) 




 Nope, that's failing to understand what Ron actually said.

Why would the team go *back* to a livery that they have barely used in the modern era, in fact a livery that they only used for two years, and has little association with the team for most fans - what would it get them? 

Even now their current logo is a [stylised version of the Marlboro Chevron](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--usxchzXG--/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_636/18z0w45eftossjpg.jpg) - because that's what they're most remembered for.

However, most people now associate the team with the silver/grey livery so they made a decision to stick with it and add in some Honda branding, the black appears to have been part of a deal with Johnnie Walker or SAP that fell through looking at their previous sponsor branding. But really the whole thing was a message to Honda and to sponsors - we're willing to change it, but you need to get on board and pay us in order to do so.

FYI the silver colour is for Mercedes, West's branding always appears on a white background. 




 Nope. They want drivers to have the same helmets because the drivers are the driving force behind team sponsorship these days (Alonso brought Santander in, Maldonado PDVSA, Hamilton got Bombardier and IWC in the door, Will Stevens has the sponsor slots at Manor). 

Basically the driver's 'brands' have become more important to the sport than the team brands and one thing F1 can do to support that is increase the association between drivers and their helmets thus strengthening their brands. Fixed driver numbers is a tilt at the same thing. 




 I find the commentary a bit difficult, always seems so casual to me compared to F1. 




 Can you give me the 101 on what a superspeedway is exactly - I've never really understood the track types. 




 If you like big numbers then this is the way to go, but it won't solve any of the problems that the sport actually has - only make them worse. 




 At no point in F1's history has that ever been true. 137 official constructors since 1950, and only 10 remain. The vast majority of F1 teams are there surviving. The median average F1 team competes in 20 races for three seasons, uses 5 drivers, wins no races and scores no points. 




 That livery was really the result of the Marlboro sponsorship - even the MP4 designation meant Marlboro Project Four at the time.

Project Four was Ron Dennis's old team, he did a reverse takeover of McLaren.

Edit: Downvoters, [you're wrong about this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren#Sponsorship.2C_naming_and_livery), the meaning was altered after Marlboro left the team. Even today the Mclaren logo is a stylised version of the [Marlboro chevron](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--usxchzXG--/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_636/18z0w45eftossjpg.jpg) 














 Love the attitude from Claire - every inch her father's daughter. 
























 We came close to doing that in 1994 - banned all of the traction and driver aids that 'purist' fans said were ruining the racing, and had little in the way of meaningful aero - look what happened. 

Sincerely, the cars were simply too quick and powerful to be controllable in general, and even modestly safe when something went wrong. Senna's death disguises a [series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSI27en56tg) [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yUxMLIbtIk) [terrifying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xumw9c5j-3A) [accidents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xd-nSWjdpHI) and on track [incidents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvxMtYyNZ6Q) during 1994 that are rarely talked of anymore. The pit lane speed limits, and downforce reduction measures we see today all came from that season's racing.

"Its going to be a season with lots of accidents, and I'll risk saying that we'll be lucky if something really serious doesnt happen." - Ayrton Senna, during the 94' pre-season.

The 94' season left two drivers dead, one in a coma, one seriously injured marshall, five injured spectators, and a seriously injured ferrari mechanic. 




 There never has been a period in F1's history where anything resembling unlimited racing occurred. 









 Button to Mercedes confirmed ;o) 
























 Frankly I'm not the one being a dick about it and straight downvoting other people's posts every day. If you have a problem with what I'm posting or the way I'm posting it then contact the mods, otherwise just move along and read someone else's content.

But personally I'm very tired of hearing from you, you're *not* the content police. 




 Its only a repost if you don't actually *read* the article, which you routinely don't.  

But apparently I'm going through another /u/musef1 bitching phase. Nevermind, I can't be arsed with bitches today.

 There were 4 other 180 mph crashes at Tamburello in the years leading up to Senna's crash - all drivers survived with the worst injury being a severe concussion. Its a flat out corner with a river behind it, hence the concrete wall. Arguably the severity of Bergers crash foreshadowed Senna's but all of the crashes involved some kind of technical failure, and all look very similar.

- [Piquet 87'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLyAKkeA25Q); 
- [Patrese 92'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCcf_aTuldY) ; 
- [Berger 89'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVxnkaqqO2c); 
- [Alboreto 91'](http://flatoutcombr.c.presscdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/alboretocrash.jpg). 

Which is all by way of saying that Senna crash led to F1 managing downforce and thereby speed, but all of that was really a consequence of the driver aids ban. In many important respects the FW14B remains the most technically advanced F1 car ever created.

Both deaths led to the HANS device as they were both on a [long list of drivers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HANS_device#History) that sustained basilar skull fractures. Senna's death wasn't caused by the skull fracture though.
