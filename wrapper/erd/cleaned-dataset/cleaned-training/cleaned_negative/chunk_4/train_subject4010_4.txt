 Sinister has moments of genuine cleverness  - like the premise, and some of the 'films' you see. The lawnmower one for example.

It just fails to really capitalise on it's own potential. Both scare-wise, but especially thematically.

Great horror films play on people's insecurities and fears truly well. 'The Thing' revolves around paranoia and trusting others. 'Cure' - a Japanese thriller/horror I can't recommend enough - does the same and also makes the viewer believe even they might be capable of terrible things and not know it. 'The Exorcist' plays on a parents fear of helplessness in the face of physical/mental illness as well as ones doubts of faith in God or the nature of the world. There's probably even more than that - it's a heck of a film and it's been a while since I watched it.

All of those fears/insecurities are enough to make people stay up at night just on their own. This is a big part of what makes the characters struggles in horror films so relatable - even though none of us will experience anything they go through.

'Sinister' toys with the notion of the main characters ego getting infront of his families safety, but it does little with it.

Take 'The Babadook' -a recent Australian horror film that's on Netflix and has received massive critical acclaim (86 on Metacritic, 98 on Rotten Tomatoes, took home best film and direction at the Aussie equivalent of the Oscars). The Babadook totally drives home it's themes. Without giving anything away, it's almost impossible to come out of the film and not understand what The Babadook was 'really' about. Hence, it ended up resonating with a lot of people in ways I haven't seen Sinister resonate with anyone.

I feel like that's the reason Sinister won't be remembered as anything more than a pretty good idea, that didn't pan out like it may have deserved. 




 That was great. Thanks for sharing that.
