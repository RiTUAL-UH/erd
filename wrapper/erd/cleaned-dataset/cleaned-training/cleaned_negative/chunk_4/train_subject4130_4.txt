 I must say though. I quite enjoyed the movie. 




  Master Chief

Keepin it real like a boss 




 Savage 




 Did he live? 




 Honestly, i'd be so pissed. Idgaf if you're drunk. 




 Holy shit. Now I'm curious as to what happened to her 




 Fat = fukno 




 I've been there. The first impression I got of the place was *wizard*  




 Wut 




 I'm thinking something like this (http://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/736x/06/04/66/060466c8fa8e39e8784a36df7e56a7a2.jpg)

But bigger and more majestic. It has a rustic, sort of magical architecture style.  




 I'll say that the new novel coming out written by Frank O'Connor covers this exact topic. The humanity and consciousness of AI. 




 Cuz her handwriting is that good. Pshh 




 Holy shit. Beard 




 This made me laugh. 




 I feel like that would inhibit gains though :/ 









 That dude in the background lmao 




 Bro your hair isn't horrible. Just get it shortened on the sides.  




 Free biscuits? 




 Jon. Will you be uploading to machinima, or staying on your old channel 




 Doubt it 




 Never. Browse. /r/politics. That is the biggest cesspool of Bernie circlejerking and liberal mob mentality I've ever seen.

On topic. Halo 5 plays nothing like other shooters, and the ADS operates nothing like it does in any other game. 




 Pretty. Keep the dark hair, goes great with your eyes. But going to need more pics in a different pose. 7.5/10 




 Yeah. But, who gives a shit.  




 Are you being serious?  




 Do you know what a straw man fallacy is? That's what I'm referring too. And I never said he doesn't believe what he's saying, or stand by it. But he spouts ridiculous statements about the economy that amount to nothing more then blaming rich people for societies problems. 




 Usually I get downvoted into oblivion when I share a critical view of what is essentially the mob mentality that Sanders is encouraging. Seriously, it's just populist rhetoric based on socialism. /r/politics is the biggest cesspool of mob mentality and has a clear lack of any critical thinking skills. 

I could go on about Sanders but I'm still baffled that this guy can garner so much support without saying a single thing of substance.  




 People are calling New Blood their favorite. Apparently it was masterfully written. 




 What a fucking idiot. Seriously, everything this guy says is Straw man.  




 Ben got absolutely *rekt* by our boy Chips Dubbo.  









 Absolutely disgusting. 




 Wait. I thought it was only freshmen that had to live on campus? 




 Eh. I like Matt Smith 




 Yes. But there will just be another set of armor underneath that. 




 Damn. Kinda feel bad for the kid. Doesn't even look like a burgeoning neckbeard 




 10/10 redhead and Cap 




 I want Johnson back.  




 Much has, but much hasn't. I guarantee that unless it's involved in banking or drugs, the money has been earned legitimately. By nature, a business's duty to society is to make a profit. It's the tell tale sign as to whether it's needed and contributing. When profit is made, money has exchanged hands and a mutual exchange of goods or service for money has occurred. That business owner is being rewarded for his contribution. This happens even with the "evil corporations" Sanders wants to stop. So the more competitive the market, the harder it is to game the system. 

The issue happens when there is no competition and then prices can gauge. Example, cable and internet companies. In this case, government regulations strangled it. Which Sanders supports. So for a variety of reasons. Capitalism  socialism in pretty much every way.

It's hard to define free flowing economy because technically it already is if it's not government. Then it would only be in other people's accounts but spread out, so it wouldn't be nearly as effective. Bill Gates can invest that money, help his own enterprise, or donate it. Which applies for most rich people and benefits the economy more then redistributing it would.  




 And super cool shit that's otherwise rare and hard to do.

Like this. 




 Like I said, neither of them are war mongers. But the economic situation is a lot more complicated then that. Like... *a lot*. Chances are, if that money ended up in someone's bank account, they either: 

1.) Had illustrious government help. Bailouts, banking cabals, cable and internet companies, funding etc etc. Basically **crony** capitalism and exempt from market competition. 

2.) Benefited society in some way to generate that capital. Take Bill Gates for example, he made his money in a way that helped society advance. He did so with no government help. Look at Elon Musk. Same example, whom without his billions in the bank account, wouldn't have been able to start SpaceX or Tesla. BOTH benefiting society in a way the government never could. 

Redistribution of wealth (if that's what you're arguing for) are basically universally bad and have the opposite of the desired effect. 

What should be done is ending corporate welfare and creating a competitive field in the market. Which mah boi Rand wants to do. And this nearly universally improves the economy.  




 He's in a difficult position, but he's more of a libertarian. He has many socially liberal views but has to appeal to a socially conservative base. So his official position on certain issues are to leave it up to the states. Even though he's introduced a bill to legalize marijuana on a federal level, and has been open in his position on ending the drug war. 

When the debate happens, Rand v Sanders. It's going to be almost completely economic. In recent years we've had candidates that were extremely similar to each other and only differed when it came to smaller issues.

Now we have candidates that *generally* share the classic American view pertaining to foreign policy and social issues, but couldn't be further apart in regard to the economy.  




 It was a completely different time. You can't compare the community then to know and still have a legitimate point about the game. 




 I believe Rand Paul to have the same honesty but with views more aligning with my own. Specifically pertaining to economics; I simply can't support the socialist views. However, if anyone other then Rand wins the Republican primary, then I'd vote Sanders. If it becomes Hillary v Bush/Cruz or whatnot. I'm voting third party.  




 They've been pretty popular since the 40's. Either way, that's one thing I respect him for. He's consistent and honest about his positions, unlike Hillary or Bush.   




 Basically. But the Brits like their traditions. I think it would make for an interesting story. 




 Or both the royal kids. I'd read it and then watch it when it is inevitably made into visual form media. 




 What a fucking idiot who spouts nothing more than populist rhetoric with no empirical evidence to prove his point. Have fun with your straw man. 




 Wait. So kids just keep dying? In pattern out of no where? 




 That's fucking brutal. How was there no criminal prosecution for the rapes? 




 I believe the response was a good one from what I can tell. Common sense says don't let someone stay that's not supposed too. 




 Bring back these physics 




 BERNIEBERNIEBERRRR 




 What part of OH? I'm from there.  




 It's not that bad anymore honestly. Occasional dickbag here and there but it's getting better. 




 Maxi pads. Apparently 




 You'd feel the same way if you got to hunt the chief 




 Seriously, this guy has put up with some shit since launch that likely go above and beyond his job description, then he routinely responds to people on Twitter experiencing issues. He also writes some amazing and detailed updates letting us know what is happening along with the thought process that goes into it. I also hear he lurks here and posts occasionally. 

Then goes and casts the HCS like a boss. 

So bravo, Bravo.

Plus, thank you Josh Holmes for interacting with Beyond. Great stuff over there.

[after glancing at his post history](http://giant.gfycat.com/AncientCarefulAnaconda.gif) 




 Great update. 




 Bro. It's been admitted in this form multiple times.  




 That was hilarious 




 Has anyone told you you have MASSIVE tits? 




 I feel bad for Hamlin at that point. He got so much undeserved shit from Jimmy because Chuck didn't have the balls to tell him himself 




 I've always wondered how BB had the best character development 




 Great post. 




 Honestly, you have a rare natural beauty about you. 9/10 

I think the reason you may look young is your height. But you still got it goin on. 




 Don't have the game mode. Could probably get it though. GT: ZeALoTT 




 Gamertag is ZeALoTT. Looking to play some customs or even grifball. Just add me and send an invite whenever you'd like to play. 




 Get the fuck out. Just get. The. Fuck. **OUT**

 




 file browser is a necessity. 

343 is denying me a basic halotural right that Bungie would have bestowed upon me as soon as I broke that clear plastic film with a knife and gently slid my disk in to my Xbox one to experience the n**BR**vana. 

I could be tagging pictures and maps with g4y, I'd out BR you, bush d1d 9/11, and phagit just like the glory days.  




 1.) MCC is playable

2.) Halo 5 is shaping up to be great. Tons of info on the *arena* out there. Plus, the lore and story is looking to be pretty good. So some research. But you might not like the way it looks, but you have to play it. I've seen people hate the way out looks and think it's going to suck, only to fall in love when they play it

3.) The halo community is not what it was. But it ***is*** growing. 




 So just a typical asshole twat. 




 They are. But I'm at a regional campus at the moment, :/

I'll be in Columbus next year though. 




 I gotta go with maybe Joe Staten doing the grunts. Nathan Fillion as Buck perhaps. 




 I saw people talking about it to on Yak so I was wondering. 




 Is this an English bulldog or an Olde English Bulldogge?  




 No. On many levels. No. They are easily still in their prime and given GEN2. Could wreck a IV 









 Will there be corgis? 




 What dicks.  




 I don't think chief is going to let innocent people die for the greater good. That's what ONI does 




 That was a really good analysis. You make good points. I keep thinking this would make a really good political/action drama 




 I'm curious. They could have stole a pelican. But they wouldn't get far without slipspace capabilities. I'm just wondering how chief is even traveling. 




 Nah I'd do it. 




 Damn, super pretty. You have amazing hair and gorgeous eyes the compliment your style. Plus, a *killer* smile. 

Would approach and talk.  




 Like I said. On a good day, it pulls upwards of 21k on average during peak hours. 




 Yup. Honestly, that game is the shit. It's current competitive settings (MLG V7) are probably the best iteration out of any halo. The custom games community is flourishing because of how customizable forge and games are, the campaign and customization options are great. Plus the file browser makes it easy to find maps, games, and other community creations. 

It had so much potential if it had only launched with better maps, and the TU settings.  




 Fuck no. This guy knows absolutely nothing about economics.  




 Idk why you got downvoted. It is easily the best version of competitive halo by far.  




 Good luck to you, Spartan.  




 No one at the moment.  




 It'd be a shame if they.... lost all of them 




 Our impenetrable fortress among the stars... 




 Bear in mind. I believe that is only the atmosphere that is on fire. Thus causing a nuclear winter, the entire surface isn't molten.  




 They get 25k on a good day 




 There will be a bunch coming out also. So check those out 




 But... pls take noble 6 with you.  




 They won't. They want it to be special for lore fans, yet still understandable by casual fans. They are making it with your concern in mind 




 If we're purely looking at the outcomes, ODSTs don't do suicide missions. And then I'd say SIVs perform, act, and were trained more like ODSTs. SIIIs however, had slightly better augmentations than S4s, plus the advantage of augmentation at puberty and post augment being close to par with IIs, and have been raised since childhood as Spartans. 

Give them GEN2 armor and they'll wreck an S4. Not to knock the IVs, but we gotta remember the hierarchy here. I get why you explained it that way though. 




 I think you got it backwards with the IIIs and IVs.  




 And that's saying something. 




 11/10 

Jet fuel can't melt dank bemez 




 So they really are the superior Spartans. I mean, they got really lucky honestly. Going into service literally when the war ends.  




 Wow. There is some serious room for AMAZING storytelling here. 




 There are 323 active S3s? I really feel like that's some ignored story potential there 




 I.. want to believe....

From a pure storytelling perspective, as others have said, he needed to die. But we never see a blade fall through him. Plus we don't know the surrounding terrain or tech. There is a slim chance he survived, but unlikely. But then again, unlikely things happen in that universe.  




 His helmet was off and on the ground while he was still alive, that was the POV during the final scene. PLUS he had been kicking elites off of him that entire time. What's to say he didn't kick the one off and sprint his ass away and hitch a ride off planet.
