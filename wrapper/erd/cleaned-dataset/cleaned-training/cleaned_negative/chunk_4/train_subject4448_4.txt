 I wish your family would stop sending friend requests on Facebook. 









 McLobster? 









 Now it's not code anymore! 









 Can confirm. There's even a Spaghetti-chicken meal combo. 




 Sorry didn't see it before, but yeah, a good leogif make my day better. 




 They use [Stripe](https://www.kickstarter.com/blog/making-payments-easier-for-creators-and-backers) now, apparently to make it easier. Not sure it is easier, though. 









 Even Batman [poops](http://toybox.io9.com/a-trading-card-of-batman-pooping-is-on-ebay-for-thousan-1679909707) 




 That's very considerate of him. 









 This might help: http://www.blogherald.com/2011/10/21/21-legal-facts-every-blogger-should-know/, particularly the section on copyright. 




 Agree! I was surprised to see Hubpages in the list, considering I thought Jeff Bullas to be an authority in the niche. 









 Now I just want some nuggets and fries. 
























 Great cash cow. Cool site, though. 




 That's exactly what I was thinking. I think the first two seasons are still the best. I just wish they could recapture that. 




 Oops. Sorry about that. 









 Interesting point of view. I remember reading a story about a boy whose father was an elephant herder, and the point of it was that an elephant never forgets - in a positive way. I don't remember all the details as I was very young then, but the young boy used to play with a young elephant and years later, in the midst of an elephant stampede the then adult herder was saved by the adult elephant, who never forgot.

But I ramble...your post is a good reminder. Thank you. 









 I want this, so I can have more space to store my hoard. 




 Timmy should get to read this. 




 Makes one want to move to SA even more! 



















 Thanks. Now penguins!=cute 









 I missed that, but no doubt he does. 









 Parenting win, this one. Where did you get the outfit? 




 I can just imagine The Doctor's delight... 









 They really do clean up nicely, don't they? 




 Then use the rates of your previous gigs as a baseline. 




 "Format comes last."

I think you missed this tip yourself, as the formatting of the article is messed up. 









 It *is* cool. Haters gonna hate.

 You totally should. If only it were possible to make a GIF of his reaction when he first sees this.
 




 Brilliant!

 I totally agree with you about Maisie fitting the character. In fact, she's probably the closest to what I imagined while reading the books; or second to Ned.

As for bullying, part of Hollywood and society in general - even online. It's admirable that she's doing something concrete and useful to battle the issue instead of just whining and starting flame wars. 









 That Vampire smile. 




 Definitely safest with 10. 
Least safe, probably 12. While I like what he has brought to the series, he's still too scary/erratic for me. 




 Sorry I didn't see that. I'll delete my post. 




 Your album suggestion is a good one, which I haven't tried. Thanks for the tip. 



















 And how hairy your feet are. 




 Yup. I'm one of those. 









 Cool concept, but does it "work"? 









 Lucky lucky you! 




 Scarf for a giant? 

Seriously awesome though. Would love to have one in bed. 









 The beard. 









 Yes to all. "Unpaid till we get funding, etc." is usually a red flag. However, if the project will look good in your resume, why not? Especially if you're new to freelancing. 









 And then the Avatar decides to run away and gets frozen in an iceberg.
