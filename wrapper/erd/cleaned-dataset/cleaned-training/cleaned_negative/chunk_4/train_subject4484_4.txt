 Diamond is the aircraft manufacturer that makes the plane in the picture. They also make one called the Katana, but it's not this one (it's a Twin Star).

To further explain, air traffic control sometimes replaces the first letters for the name of the manufacturer. 




 The only things that need fixing in that game are a shortcut to take things out of your bag and longer days.

 I'm... not correcting myself. It is near the horizon at sunrise, my first post wasn't wrong. 




 Yeah, it rises at sunset and sets at sunrise. My window is to the west so I see it setting at sunrise.

 I'm doing my first build and intended to get my Windows 8 from Dreamspark, but at the checkout I see this message:

*c.  Using Windows Desktop Operating Systems.  Your DreamSpark Direct Subscription includes certain Windows operating system products. You may install these products only on a computer that is already licensed to run a full version of a Windows operating system on it, as evidenced by a valid Certificate of Authenticity (COA) for a Windows operating system affixed to the computer.*

Does that mean I can't use it for a build?
