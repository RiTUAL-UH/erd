 If you want to find a copy, go to pretty much any Goodwill.  Me and a girlfriend used to go thrift store shopping all the time and that album was a bit of a running joke between us. 




 Go in and demand $3 off your order.  It does not say anything to the contrary other than "$1 off with this flier", which you have 3 of. 




 That is a very well fed coyote. 




 JMB also has the [Geiger kilo for $576 shipped](http://www.jmbullion.com/1-kilogram-geiger-security-line-silver-bar/), as well. Best price I've seen for the Geiger in my vendor comparisons.

You won't beat JMB's price on the [Johnson Matthey kilos at $542](http://www.jmbullion.com/1-kilogram-johnson-matthey-silver-bar/). 









 If you want to talk about selling out taxpayers, forget this small fish and go straight to the top dog: Congress. 




 Seeing what they close at today, gold is down nearly 2.5% so far.  Will do some weekend comparison shopping for sure. 




 Why are their product photos inverted/reversed? 




 Ah, I think you're right, price difference on *those* goats, even just one, is negligible. I forgot about that line...Had assumed he was referring to Perth Lunar Goats, I was definitely going to grab a couple of those @ $170.

 But where did you buy yours at $169? Provident is showing them at $188.80, JMB at $188.70. 




 Where did you get this? 



















 [$26.26 each @ Gainesville](http://www.gainesvillecoins.com/products/169530/2015-rwanda-cape-buffalo-african-wildlife-1-oz-silver-coin-sealed-in-plastic.aspx).

[$31.24 @ APMEX](http://www.apmex.com/product/85992/2015-rwanda-1-oz-silver-african-buffalo)

Playing around with various counts:

* $544.85 for 20 @ Gainesville, this is with my rapey quoted USPS shipping of $19.45!
* $585.00 for 20 @ APMEX with free shipping

If you're looking for this coin, might want to take a look at Gainesville.

 




 Only way to find out is to smash a window and go through the interior to find the registration.  Please post a photo of this during a sunrise or sunset.  Ideally a lost cat or dog (with no collar) can be included in the background as well. 




 Magnificent. 




 Yes, you're paranoid.

* They need to move inventory, that's the business they're in.
* They have sales, this part of the prior bullet point.
* You don't know what they paid for it.
* It may be a loss leader, i.e., it gets people to their site (new/recurring) where they buy other shit that has a bigger profit margin.
* Their sales have no effect on spot price, they would have to move massive amounts onto the market to have any impact on spot price.
* They are no doubt massively hedged. Spot could go down, sales could go down, but they could conceivable make more $ because they're hedged (they make the $ up elsewhere).
* APMEX has more Illuminati reptilians in shipping/receiving than in management. There is no conspiracy here until The Super Blood Moon Shemitah happens this September 23rd, thus the sign of Gozer's coming. WAKE UP!!! 




 I'd shoot my wife for $10. 




 Loads fast, works well. 




 They do not.

Sometimes price differences between the two sites are negligible (even with shipping charge), sometimes they're quite surprising. I usually load up carts between those two with the same items and then start whittling them down based on respective prices. Well, actually I do that across all my regular vendors. Instead of one order with one vendor I can end up with 2 or 3 separate orders with 2 or 3 separate vendors.  There is $ to be saved this way.

As always, you should do some price comparison before ordering.  




 I've seen the tour video before, who is putting this into production?

 [1oz Goats for $27.40 @ Provident](http://www.providentmetals.com/2015-1-oz-silver-australian-year-of-the-goat-coin-perth-mint-lunar-series-2.html), $26.40 if you buy 20. 




 I also just registered a business name with my city, but need to save up a few hundred dollars to become an llc.

If you have to save up a few hundred bucks to pay for a filing fee, you are no where near being ready to go out on your own (financially).

Bears are very smart and have been known to roll rocks into bear traps to set off the trap and eat the bait in safety. Smart like the legal team at Dewey Cheatum   Howe, LLP.

Canoeists have to keep their centre of mass low, so they dont capsize the canoe. Same strategy can be applied to tort law.
 














 How about a picture of a grizzly bear? Or if they specialize in maritime law, how about a picture of a canoe?

 Why is the Enterprise not in orbit? Also, it probably wasn't the best idea to put the torpedo tube in a flood plain. 




 There's been quite a few ASE deals on ebay since January. APMEX has had multiple auctions. MCM has had one as well. Also, Silvertowne had a deal on a tube of Buffaloes recently.

Maybe it's just me, but I don't remember many of these deals last year.  They're popping up like every couple weeks so far this year so seems like no big deal to miss one. 




 Out of stock.

 Shit, you're right, it's listed right on the page I ordered from :) Surprised the Wikipedia page doesn't have these mintages. 









 I plan on buying 1/5th of the remaining gold in the world to make luxury coffee mugs. 




 I just placed an order.

They're down to 8 as of 12:35pm PST, if you're interested you better act fast. Based on the comments here so far, it looks like 6 of them have sold in the past 20 minutes or so.

Anyone know the supposed mintage on these?  [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Silver_Panda) lists them as ?????.  Do the COAs come numbered in regards to the total? Something like 16,787 of 30,000. 




 Traditional combustion engines in automobiles are not going away anytime soon.

* Gasoline has the refueling infrastructure set up
* Gasoline refueling time is in single digit minutes, not hours, though I think the Tesla can recharge 50% in 30 minutes
* Gasoline has the driving range. I think hot/cold weather also compounds driving range with electrics
* Hybrids still have the internal combustion engine
* China
* India 









 It's naive to say what businesses should do because hey, MS *should* just use V8 and Webkit/Blink/Whatever...This whole Spartan is a waste of time, IE *should* be Chrome under the covers, right?

Have you ever worked in a really big, enterprise/corporate environment?  Choice is not a given. Your job is to support the business, which usually is far from Chrome Experiments.

I'd like to get you in on a conference call with Nike where you can tell them the problem is they're using a terrible browser and they should just install another one.  BTW, there are parts of Nike that are still on IE7. They pay us a metric shit ton of $ every year. 




 Come on now, that's that saying they claim it's always going to go up in price. Soon. Don't wait or you'll miss it. Buy now. The end is near, repent now. We take paypal. 




 Some people don't have a choice as to what browser they use, i.e., corporate lock down. Can't imagine you're doing real work for real business from 9-5.

 Impressive collection.

For cost he says he's in for everything on a per oz basis of $34.21. I'd be more curious as to what each year cost, not everything averaged out.

Also says total oz is 461.4 so he's all in for **$15,784**. 




 Is your order under $1k? 









 I recently placed an order and it was $hipped out UPS, which really sucks for me as it's a 20+ mile trip (one way) to go pick it up. And I live in a major metro area....And of course you don't find out your carrier until you get the tracking number.

I wonder if UPS is their exclusive carrier now. That would definitely be a show stopper for me as saving $20 on an order isn't worth the inconvenience of UPS. I doubt I'd ever save enough to make it worth my while. 




 If you're young enough to join the military, I'd recommend going that path.  Special forces.  It's definitely more safe than a career in front-end development. Also, you can frag your boss when the going gets tough. 




 Honestly, I didn't even know Michigan had the internet. Surprised CNN hasn't picked this up yet. 




 There is no perfect front-end code.  Front-end code is going to be touched by many people, with different levels of skill, under different time constraints, with incomplete requirements, documenting nothing.

Get used to it. 




 You're right, it's the seat back. I thought it was some sort of bigger separator.  Nice catch. 




 I can tell you that train is built by Bombadier, I think out of Belgium.  We have these in Portland (they have little manufactured badges inside), but we don't have them with the horizontal metal beam in the foreground.

That guy does look like everyone on the train, though. 




 Started with these last year, have a tube of 2014 and 2015. I'll most likely pick up a tube each year. 









 [Here are the worst of mine](http://imgur.com/a/orgQl) from a tube via the Silvertowne ebay deal. They don't bother me at all, they're just generic silver rounds. 




 One thing you need to keep in mind is the percentage change in silver to the percentage change in gold (per metric ton squared), when the latter has a causal influence on the former.

Think of silver spot price given in terms of differential calculus. In other words, it is a tool for measuring the responsiveness of one variable to changes in another, causative variable (silver to gold). Silver has the advantage of being a unitless ratio (excluding the troy ounce), independent of the type of quantities being varied. 

In empirical work regarding silver forecasting, you'll find the lows are the estimated coefficient in a linear regression equation where both the dependent variable and the independent variable are in natural logs.

You also need to factor in the percentage change in silver output induced by a percent change in silver input. 




 I'm glad to see this as my money is on radical Islamic fundamentalists being behind all the local missing cats. 









 I've been paying just due to the convenience factor. I'll take a look at taxslayer, thanks for the recommendation.

 I've achieved my goal for a bullion position

Does this include gold, platinum and palladium?  If not, why not get a couple ounces of each? Or spend 2015 stacking non-silver? You could also spend this time to learn about silver numismatics. 




 Thanks, I'll check that out.

Do I need to provide electronic copies of my W2/mortgage interest/1099? 




 Yeah, I found some on retailmenot.com earlier as well. 




 Had to have been November 30th.  I bought a tube of the 2014 Libertads as well as a tube of the Canadian Bisons that Sunday night. I believe I ordered @ $14.72 




 I have pretty simple taxes:

* W2 wages
* Mortgage insurance
* 1099 misc income (from interest)
* No Obamacare
* No kids or any other deductions - as I said, pretty simple taxes

I've been going to a local guy for years but I'd like to save some $ and do them myself. He charges me around $100.

TurboTax and H R Block look to be the big players out there.  From my limited research, H R Block seems to get better reviews.  It looks like their Deluxe + State would be the best for me.

Some questions I have for those who have filed your own taxes online:

* Do I need to get electronic copies of my W2, mortgage insurance and 1099 that get sent along with my e-filing?
* If I need to print out forms, does something like H R Block Deluxe let you save those out to PDFs for printing? I don't have a printer at home so would want to be able to print it out at work. For example, if I have to pay state taxes, I don't want to pay to e-file that, I'd want to print out and mail my state return.

Any hidden gotchas I should be aware of?  I would have nothing to import from previous years, so this would be brand new tax filing for me. 









 Might want to invest in a collar there, toots. 




 What type of companies have you worked for?  i.e., enterprise, large/small agency, small software, etc. 



















 The best way to have $50k in gold and silver in this market in one year is to start with $75k.

Looks like there is a street car in the lower left. The early ones were horse-drawn, which fits the time frame here, but there is not a visible horse in the photo, though it could be on the other side. Could also be electric as I think they had those pre-1900. 




 He was also extremely pro-gold before his Fed days.  **Before** he was the chairman, he heralded gold as being the true currency. **While** he was chairman, he denounced that statement. **After** he retired, he once again spoke about the reality of gold being the true currency. [Most recently that I'm aware of, speaking about gold at the Council on Foreign Relations, October 29, 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oz4-Tru_30A). 




 It looks like you need to buy 25 of the 25th anniversary to get the discount. This pricing may change this Wednesday, on the 25th (for the ultimate pricing trifecta), but that is pure speculation on my part. 




 Typically, dealers have a cost threshold that triggers signatures on shipping.  From my experience, that seems to be $500. 




 Their shipping charge is $7.77 on any order, lol. 




 Can confirm, when I add a tube to my cart and try to apply the redemption code it tells me:

This redemption code is linked to another eBay account 




 They're currently going for $53.28 each

Anyone else think a $10 premium for a [reported mintage of 9k](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertad_%28coin%29#Libertad_Silver_Series_.28Brilliant_Uncirculated.29_Minting_History..5B2.5D) is a bit much?  If the mintage were half that I could see it, but maybe it's just me.  What sayeth the peanut gallery?

 I've never worked anyplace where IT didn't mandate your "choice" of gear. Most of the time there is no choice.

I've never been able to pick out what I want, so I don't want to get anything too crazy/expensive

Fuck that, go crazy.  I'm sure you have to, or will have to, deal with a lot of bullshit at work.  Might as well have a nice system. Remember, monitors are cheap, don't skimp on your computer.

 I've found the trick is to just write your css like you always have pre-sass.  There's something really magical about compiling a .scss to .css with zero changes in the input/output file.  I don't know how it all works to be honest, it's just ones and zeros flying around to me. 




 You could try calling Home Depot or Lowes, they have contractors they use for various installs of stuff they sell.  They might be able to give you a referral.

 I'd contact APMEX and see what they say about how your orders were sent. 

http://www.apmex.com/faq

*How is my order shipped?
*American Precious Metals Exchange orders are shipped Registered/Insured U.S. Mail,   UPS. Each package is fully insured and may require a signature upon delivery.*

The "may require a signature" is probably determined by your order amount, which they could verify.

You could also be seeing a bug on USPS' tracking display.  If APMEX confirms they were sent with signature confirmation, it sounds like you have a problem with your postal carrier. In which case you'd at least know where the breakdown occurred and where to go to get it resolved in the future. 




 Only IF convicted.  I'm hoping we can throw in arson AND kidnapping as well. Might as well go for that felony conviction with some style. 




 You sure it was signature confirmation and not something like delivery confirmation?

Via https://www.usps.com/ship/insurance-extra-services.htm

*Signature Confirmation*
*Find out information about the date and time an item was delivered, or when a delivery attempt was made. Add security by requiring a signature.*

If it was sent signature confirmation and you didn't sign for it:

* Claim you didn't get it
* When they provide delivery information, ask them for your signature indicating you signed for it
* Get insurance $
* Send me 50% 




 Were you orders under $500? From my experience, this *seems* like the cut off for signatures for the big vendors.  I recently picked up a tube of buffaloes from Silvertowne via ebay and they were just left in my mailbox.  $340 order.

 I thought it was fairly well known that Silvertowne was run by a sect of the Illuminati in concert with the banking cartel in their quest for a New World Order. We should get this added to the sidebar.

Also, APMEX are Freemasons of the Holy Royal Arch of the national Supreme Council, which explains their recent ebay "deal".

 **I would steer clear of goldmart.**  I've ordered from them once.  **Once**...I really think they sell what they don't have in stock (like Amagi), despite claiming they have it "in stock, ready to ship".  I also think they drop ship orders because when my order finally arrived, it was covered in multi-colored stamps.  [Imagine this, but literally covered in different colorful stamps](http://www.sandafayre.com/stockimages/26343163.jpg).  It really screamed unprofessional to me, but maybe that wouldn't bother anyone else.  I really wish I would have taken a picture of it to post whenever I share my goldmart experience.

Goldmart was the lowest price I found, but I will never do business with them again.

[Silver.com is 40 cents more per coin](http://www.silver.com/2015-1-oz-silver-canadian-maple-leafs/) and I can't recommend them enough.  They're the same folks as JM Bullion.  They're awesome. Silver.com is the cheapest I found doing some quick price comparisons. 




 That's fucked up if you bought on the 10th like me.  I hit the BIN in the evening as well. 




 There are a couple with some tiny dings, but I don't really care as they're generic and they were like 10 cents over spot.  The tube ran me $340.01. Hard to say no to that, IMO. 

One had what almost looked like a diagonal score line across the back.  I'll try to get some photos up tonight, though sadly my camera isn't the greatest.  They'll go off to the safe deposit box Monday so if I can't get good quality photos tonight, the photos ain't happening :(

They look fine to me, again, generics, don't really care!

[**Photos of by far the worst two**](http://imgur.com/a/orgQl) and it sounds dumb, but they actually look worse in the photos than in person. Being generic as generic gets, doesn't bother me at all.  It's hard to photograph coins with my crappy camera....Subject matter is highly reflective, don't have the best lighting, camera macro isn't the greatest and the auto focus tends to do its own thing, sometimes half is in focus, half a little blurry.

The way ebay ASEs are going this year, I'll have a monster box by April, lol. 




 To be honest, this is how I think of all you guys posting here. 




 I know Silvertowne doesn't have the best reputation here with some folks in regards to their ebay auctions...I just wanted to post up [my tube of Buffaloes from a recent ebay auction of theirs](http://www.reddit.com/r/Silverbugs/comments/2vfkwa/ebay_deal_tube_of_buffaloes_for_34322/cohvcy1?context=3) was delivered today.

Hit the BIN on the 10th, in my mailbox/hands on the 13th.

Was my first Silvertowne purchase as well.

 




 "3% is normal daily fluctuations.."

This seems a little high for normal daily fluctuations, no? I would also think gold would be tied to it a bit more than it currently is today. Maybe it's just me, though... 



















 You could skype him and describe the designs using a puppet show.  I've found this strategy to be pretty effective.  My dog also seems likes the puppet show as well. You can spin that on skype as your dog being your business partner. 




 Yes sir.  They're my favorite generics and they were like 10 cents over spot.  A tube ran me $340.01, I think it was. 




 Design masturbation, there are no real security features. If you think the UV light is it, that is not real security.  Some nice illustrations, but design should solve a problem. 




 My order last night (of said Buffaloes) shipped out tonight from Indiana according to USPS tracking.  *My* ebay transaction seems to be panning out so far. 




 Did a Silvertowne ebay BIN last night, USPS tracking says it departed IN this evening.

 Can we link to ebay "deals" from the big vendors?  If so, can you all start linking directly when posting said deals.  If not, can you include the item # in your post so it's easier to find said deals.

Happy hump day.

Yes.

 Did an [ebay BIN on a tube of ASEs Friday eve](http://www.reddit.com/r/Silverbugs/comments/2v1omp/if_you_love_ase_like_i_do/codqf7v).  Just got home from work Monday pm and there was a delivery attempt notification. This was literally coast-to-coast shipping as well. I wasn't expecting anything before like Wednesday, tracked the ebay shipping # to make sure it was the ASEs and the delivery attempt was indeed the ASEs.

I've only purchased from them 2x (both via ebay, both ASEs tube sales) and this purchase is absolutely bananas!

Bananas, I tell you.
