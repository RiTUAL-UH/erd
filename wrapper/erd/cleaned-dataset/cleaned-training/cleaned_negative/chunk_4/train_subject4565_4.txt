 Didn't we find that out in 4x02? 




 Doesn't make it good. The ending is still weak, with nothing to say about any of its characters. Every single AC game apart from this one does that very well. Altair, Ezio (x3), Connor (kind of), Edward and Shay all had endings that put their leads' journeys into perspective. Arno learns the dangers of revenge...but then goes through with it anyway...and doesn't become an assassin again...but gets a Master Assassin outfit...and honours his dead...and joins Napoleon...what? It's a mishmash of stuff happening, but none of it resonates because there's no real conclusion to any kind of journey. I still hate the direction the modern day story has gone. 




 Chronicle turned out pretty great. It was extremely relatable for someone like me, as I used to wish I had telekinesis when I was a young Star Wars fan.    
However, there were some issues: how could he have never heard of telekinesis? He's a shut-in who listens to Bowie - sci-fi themed music. He'd know about telekinesis.    
Also, his father is a raging drunk. Andrew hates him for his drinking habits and what it does to him. At the talent show after-party, Andrew gets blasted without any choice shown as to whether he might refuse or stop to consider whether it's a good idea. He doesn't even try to drink responsibly. He would have spent a considerable chunk of his life resenting this drunk figure and every aspect of what makes him horrible, so it doesn't make any fucking sense that just because Andrew's a teen, we might assume *of course he's going to get wasted*. It just doesn't make sense considering the three guys don't want to let anyone know about their powers, but they're putting their better judgement on the line without discussing it. Might have happened off screen, but whatever.     
    
It's just a tiny aspect that frustrated me. All in all, pretty cool film. 




 Raging Boll! That's fucking gold. 




 Not Drama? I didn't laugh once. With an opening line such as Calvary's, I didn't exactly get a funny vibe from any of it.     
[first line spoilers](/s "I first tasted semen when I was seven years old.") 




 Looks like it's Chronicle x Butterfly Effect. 




 Directed by Martin McDonagh's brother. Great film, but it's not a comedy.  




 Maybe that statement was a stunt too. I wouldn't put it past the guy. 




 Correct 




 He also called himself "the only genius in the whole fucking business", and [admitted he's *never played a video game*](http://www.laserlemming.com/2014/09/03/uwe-boll-admits-hes-never-played-a-video-game/), despite having so many game adaptations on his CV.    
At least Tommy Wiseau *wanted* to make a masterpiece. Boll only wants money.     
Edit: apparently the genius thing was part of a stunt to drum up controversy for one of the Postal movies. What a tool. 




 Agreed. 




 Nope, sorry :) 




 Also correct. 




 Correct 




 Gone Girl, Nightcrawler, The Imitation Game. 




 Video compiled and edited by regular Lost series editor Mark J. Goldman. 




 *applause* 




 Mass Effect and The Dark Tower. Both have finite ends, but they're better than nothing! 




 How is it a mystery that people have powers? In other movies and TV shows, we just accept that it's possible and move on. That's not something that should need an answer. 




 TV On the Radio covering Bowie, in a Game of Thrones trailer full of unseen footage. How much awesome... 




 You know what, I've never even thought about this... 




 Aside from Blade Runner or Taxi Driver, I'd say Gone Girl. I kind of wanted some kind of closure to any of the characters, like Margo or the cops. I FULLY UNDERSTAND THE WEIGHT OF IT ALL. It's just an unsatisfying, weak note to leave on.    
But, hey: [spoilers](#s "That's marriage, baby!") 




 Casino Royale and Skyfall do this well. People forget that the only Daniel Craig Bond movie where he actually succeeds in what he's trying to do, is godawful. Given, they're more Empire Strikes Back-style of things all going to shit, but it's honestly better than forced happy endings. 




 Lol you could say that. 




 He was much better in Season 1 than he is in Season 2, trust me. 




 I kind of hate the camerawork and cinematography in The Avengers. So many Dutch angles and close-ups! Once the action gets going, it's fantastic and exhilarating. That first hour is pretty hard to sit through for me. 




 Okay, I've fixed it now :) 




 *The Star Spangled Man, wiiiiith a plan!* 




 It's a pretty unpopular opinion whenever I post it. I usually get a long rant about why I'm completely wrong. 




 You're not remembering the 2 hour DLC pack, released on Valentine's Day, about [spoilers](#s "the death of her *girlfriend*")? 




 I honestly thought we were past Lost-bashing. I love that show :( 




 Lol I meant stories you could tell in a movie.    
My ideas for cutting out so many parts of the main story was to make room for crew time, which is crucial for fleshing out the characters. I'm sure you could fit it all in. Sure, you could set cool little horror pieces or hard sci-fi stories in this universe, but I want to see Tali on the big screen! I want to hear Garrus' epic voice booming in surround sound. We're attached to the main characters partly because they represent completely different races. Having any other Turians, Quarians or Asari wouldn't be the same.  




 Hey, you've still got Kaidan and Ash as male/female stand-ins for Shepard!     
All joking aside, is there much else to tell in this universe other than THE END OF CIVILISATION AS WE KNOW IT? There are many original stories you can form in ME's universe around this event, but I'm saying since the original games are based around this one conflict, it would be a wasted opportunity to ignore such a magnificent story. In fricking IMAX. I would *insert vulgar comment here*. 




 Cap 1 was the best Phase One movie.     
EDIT 2: Instead of the previous edit containing admittedly pathetic early complaining about a single downvote, I'll just  leave this:    
*Meatball. Meatball. Spaghetti underneath. Ravioli. Ravioli. Great Barrier Reef!* 




 Check to see if they're region b locked on http://regionfreemovies.com/ . Tons of Blu-Rays are actually region free, but only labelled by the region they're manufactured for. 




 Mass Effect. Not any of my artsy ideas, or the one biopic I've thought about.     
Here's the major issue: Shepard, male or female, is a hard-edged space marine. Any mainstream audience would find it painful to follow a character that is constantly forced to make tough decisions and may not necessarily pick the option you'd choose.     
**That's why you kill Shepard off on Virmire.**     
Make the crew the focus. God, that's still too many lead characters - two would be CG, one under heavy make-up and another needing CG feet.       
Unlike in the game, the characters would be actually interacting, arguing, training etc. rather than standing/sitting in one spot between missions. Feros is unnecessary, Noveria can be whittled down to a scene of Shepard visiting the already dead Rachni queen, Benezia v Liara, 1v1 360 no scopes Dawn of Justice could be shifted to the Citadel bleh bleh.     
Here you've got a fresh Lovecraftian sci-fi action franchise with brains, untapped because Legendary Pictures have been sitting on the license. 




 I believe he explains it to Sawyer, whose life was also ruined by Anthony Cooper. 




 Gladly. 




 Thing is, many countries outlaw Nazi iconography. And rightfully so.     
Blaming an entire people for a small group of extremists' crimes is going too far. Encouraging physical harm is distasteful and widely looked down upon. It's propaganda and it should be discouraged. 




 *Downey Olympics*    
My god, man... 




 Nikki and Paulo in **LOST** were not good. The episode used to kill them off was fantastic, though. 




 /r/masserect 




 [Birdman spoilers](#s "Because he gives him false hope - the happy look on Riggan's face is heartbreaking knowing it's based on a lie") 




 Not to mention the dialogue was clearly written by someone who doesn't know how English people speak. So many lines sounded like excerpts from a Jane Austen movie trailer. 




 Actually it's a deleted scene from The Muppets. Close, though. 




 What I meant was that AMC are certain it's going to be a hit *because it's related to Breaking Bad*. They already know people will respond well to it, so getting the word out - positive word - would be their main priority in order to secure viewers because, like you said, they have to convince people that the show has potential to last. 




 IMDb synopsis contains hardcore spoilers. 




 Yeah? I hate it when they do that. 




 Oh my god, is his name Eddie too? Locke says this is Deus Ex Machina several times. 




 Gotta say I was quite disappointed in Gone Girl. I didn't expect a David Fincher thriller which was continuously ramping up in tension to end the way it did. I quite enjoyed it up until then. It was certainly original, but I can't say any of the important characters got closure. The line [spoilers](#s "That's marriage, baby!") seemed to me like an excuse.       
I fully expect to be downvoted to oblivion, so I'll hope you guys can accept some difference in opinion. 




 That scene was very hard to watch, but not because of that. 




 Critics usually get pilot/first episode screener copies early if the network has faith in the show. Getting the first three episodes? AMC are certain it's going to be a hit and want to get positive word out. 




 *Better Call Saul will air exclusively in New Zealand on on-demand service Lightbox.*    
    
Great business move by Telec- I mean, "Spark", with Netflix coming this year and with Soho only really being popular during Game of Thrones seasons. 




 Only AC platinum with a default name :( 




 Will that be after [Aussie Sniper](http://youtu.be/s0hsmTp608U)? 




 Since this game became available on PS+, the platinum percentage has plummeted. 




 You removed the word rumour from the title. 




 That sadly doesn't work on mobile. It just shows the word YOLO as the fourth word in your comment, linking to a blank page. 




 I liked the fact that the professor was called Callahan as a clear Dirty Harry reference, because the city is half San Francisco.      
Apart from that, speeding up your main pop song for time constraints is a crime in any movie. As soon as the brother drove on screen, I thought straight away that *this guy is a walking tombstone. He's not in any of the promos and he's an endlessly perfect role model.* I groaned when he Uncle Ben'd.     
Overall: great animation, cool concepts, but it's such an origin story! We're all sick of that. 




 The real crime in this video is the editing. 




 Which pixel? 




 Why are they ten metres apart? 




 Thank you! 




 ...is that body paint? 




 I thought it was impossible for Shaggy to look more like a stoner. 




 Interstellar. It's supposed to be a love letter to sci-fi, but although it's quite inventive, the ending was telegraphed. It's quite similar to concepts I've read about in Clarke's 2001 and 2010, so I was legitimately frustrated at the Nolans for going in that direction when the film had so much potential to end in an original and satisfying way, not telegraphed and just *good* compared to the fucking incredible film it had mostly been. 




 Great way to find out your job is in jeopardy - browsing Reddit. My condolences to whoever this affects. 




 Makes sense. 




 How the fuck did I not notice this before?! 




 Should we count Pirhana 2 as a Cameron movie? 




 *Matthew Vaughn has seen Fifty Shades of Grey. He said "It's good. If you like Chronicle, you'll like this."* 




 Matthew Vaughn said that about Fantastic Four, a movie he's producing, which is directed by Josh Trank, who made Chronicle...or is this a meme now? 




 I agree with both of them, sorry. It tries to be about two separate aspects of one man's life but at just over 100 minutes long, it ran ridiculously short for how much it tried to cram in.     
The dialogue sounds like it was written an American screenwriter who doesn't know how to make characters sound English, and the Norwegian director does pretty well making it sound natural...but it doesn't help that so many of its lines read like trailer excerpts.      
So much of the Bletchley Park story felt off. A tad unrealistic, and that's because it actually didn't happen like that at all. They were all fully behind Turing's project - in fact he was specifically brought in to work on those machines. Why did it have to be turned into The Social Network? 




 I'm on mobile, and usually download movies straight from YouTube. I don't want to sit at the computer watching it, using up more data than I would from otherwise. 




 2:40? The movie is much shorter than that. Guessing it's another slowed down one (ugh). 




 And even if, like Lilly, you have literally less than two minutes. 




 Fucking Zac Efron doesn't take up much time. You can fit Netflix in. 




 Why were Guy Pearce and Evangeline Lilly in the top billed cast of that film? Their *combined* screen time takes up about 7% of the entire runtime. 




 Really? Nice. Take it home after the film ceases showing! 




 I misread that last sentence sorry. 




 I kind of expected her to die in AoU. The MCU has propelled her career and I thought she wanted to go in new directions, but this is certainly not bad news! 




 Because it's a visual effects nomination, and that's what his scenes showcased. 




 I worded it pretty badly. 




 It's kinda plagiarism if they don't credit them. 




 It's the iTunes poster iirc, or at least the iTunes poster we have in New Zealand. 




 Therefore I said "Cuse *had* joined the show". 




 Because you play /r/games on them, and I use mine all the time. 




 Not on Vita. Your memory card is tied to your account, and they're super expensive. 




 It was not actually intended to be a one-shot. It was more that Lindelof underestimated the popularity the show would gain, as the main reason he opted to co-write the pilot was to get his foot in the door with JJ Abrams. After a season of clearly running the characters in circles, Cuse had joined and they began to put full effort into show running a show that was clearly not going to end soon.     
Plus, ABC not Fox ;) 




 You can only buy it on the internet, and not in Australia on PSN, on any of the three Playstation platforms the original was released on. 




 Damon fully admitted to doing this in Season 1 because he thought the show would get cancelled. The tone of the guy being interviewed, and the writer, is what makes it sound much worse than it really is. 




 Plus an entire 40 minutes of character development and great moments that do not screw with the pacing at all. Great extended cut. 




 Ewww, I forgot about that out-of-the-blue corny Bennifer sex scene that they thankfully removed from the Director's Cut. 




 Hotline Miami is actually a downloadable title, so EB Games is not in the conversation. 




 I hope to God this doesn't effect New Zealand. 




 That doesn't change my opinion. 




 My memory might be failing me in that part. 




 Do we ever have evidence of that, though? 




 Europe, Australia and New Zealand, yes. Not in North America, though. 




 It's not exactly plagiarism if your main goal is to give people hope. 




 Inception and The Prestige are good enough to be in the conversation, IMO, but Interstellar certainly needed a few rewrites - anything to remove the telegraphing of the plot resolution, from Act 1. It was almost exactly what I expected to happen, having seen 2001 and read 2010. It was clearly an homage to films like 2001, but it didn't need to come as close to copying them as it did. 




 Partly, I felt like saying something controversial but after I finished the film a few hours ago, I was extremely let down by the ending. The film goes in such an insane, surreal direction that it felt unearned for the story to come full circle. His wife is crazy and her story had some insane holes - the freaking woodshed?! At least if the movie ended 15 minutes earlier, it might have been left up to your imagination (if I'm not mistaken, that's closer how the book ends). The *suggestion* that what we do get out of the ending may be the outcome of the entire debacle, I believe, may have been more satisfying than *knowing* this is probably the beginning of the rest of their lives. By going on longer, you get the feeling that there may be another few twists and turns, considering how many were crammed into the rest of the film; however, that's not the case.      
TL;DR: lack of ambiguity for their future, ten minutes too long, full circle ending unearned IMO.
