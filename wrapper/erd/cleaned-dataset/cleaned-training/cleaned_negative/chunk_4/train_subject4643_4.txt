 Harry Potter looks like a really old Bill Gates. Well they atleast nailed Dumbledore and Snape for sure. 




 This is exactly what I thought about Guardians of the Galaxy. The story drags itself around back and forth and doesn't end anywhere but to a sequel. By the way, World War Z wasn't critically acclaimed in the first place. It has 68% on rt and 7/10 on imdb. It was just an 'ok' movie. 




 Gone Girl. 




 * Das Boot
* Aguirre, wrath of god
* Fitzcarraldo
* The 400 blows
* La Haine
*  Stalker
 




 Can't tell if this is either clever marketing or legit post. 









 Nah, anyone can visit the criterion closet. Even Alec Baldwin and Bill Hader have dvd picks video. 




 Nope, this is just a series of videos for their youtube channel where directors come and pick their favourite movies.  




 You mean Delta Farce : the underrated gem. amirite?  




 I would add 'King of Comedy' to that list. 









 The uploader put great effort into editing the audio. But, as Stanley Kubrick's interviews are very rare, it was worth for sure. 
This meant that you'd hear Kubrick talk for about 3 or 4 seconds and then have a translator jump in and repeat what he said in French at a louder volume. Usually the translator would step in and cut off the first or last words that Kubrick was saying, or sometimes just talk over the top of him, making it even more difficult to listen to. Maddeningly, the translator would sometimes interject after he said only three or four words! Ciment's English-language questions were spoken over in French simultaneously, often rendering them impossible to hear.

 Some people just can't watch them. Make them watch all the shitty movies first. Then good new ones. Then they realize to watch the good old classics. 




 [/uj] GG Hollywood if they hire a good mexican director for a superhero film. [/uj] 




 Stephen Amell should play the Green Arrow in the DC movie universe. I hope he lands roles in other movies too. 









 Leo to the right. 




 Criterion doesn't release underrated gems like this you pleb. It only releases famous mainstream movies. 




 I'm pretty sure it's Region free. 




 Real human bean !!! 














 DAE Tide ad-placement.  




 Never heard of this movie before, trailer seems good. Gonna give it a try. 




 Le'oscarino 




 I feel like the kid on the right will grow up to become Jack Nicholson. 









 Did DiCaprio bleed in this movie ?? 




  I think these movies may help :

* Wall Street
* A Bronx Tale 
* Kramer Vs. Kramer
* In the Name of The Father
* Sons Of Anarchy (TV-Show) 




 Not quite my tempo.

 Ok. 




 [For anyone interested about the story in the movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EShApFSrXqw)  




 **Fun Fact** : Walt Disneys last written words were apparently Kurt Russell

As Walt Disney laid on his deathbed, suffering from lung cancer, in 1966, the story goes (later confirmed by Kurt Russell) that he scribbled on a piece of paper the name Kurt Russell. He died never writing another word.  Many have speculated what this could have meant, including the famous actor himself, Kurt Russell who in a 2007 appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live said, Its true. I dont know what to make of that. I was taken into his office one time after he died and I was shown that. Russell was a child actor at the time for Disney, having just signed a ten year contract with the studio.

 Terminator. Just forget everything after T2. 




 Yes, they have been posted on /r/movies individually before. 




 The first one I bought was the JFK steelbook for ~$25 after doing a lot of research on steelbooks. This was just at the end of last year. I was really interested in buying only steelbooks at first but ended up buying normal Blu-rays too.  




 Here are some that I like (No Particular Order) :

* The Hunt
* Alan Partridge
* Jiro Dreams Of Sushi
* 13 Assassins 
* Troll Hunter
* Europa Report
* 3:10 To Yuma
* Terminator 2
* Drive

 [A message to young people from tarkovsky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Vvdtaaprzw)


"What would you like to tell people?"


"I dont know I think Id like to say only that they should learn to be alone and try to spend as much time as possible by themselves. I think one of the faults of young people today is that they try to come together around events that are noisy, almost aggressive at times. This desire to be together in order to not feel alone is an unfortunate symptom, in my opinion. Every person needs to learn from childhood how to be spend time with oneself. That doesnt mean he should be lonely, but that he shouldnt grow bored with himself because people who grow bored in their own company seem to me in danger, from a self-esteem point of view."
