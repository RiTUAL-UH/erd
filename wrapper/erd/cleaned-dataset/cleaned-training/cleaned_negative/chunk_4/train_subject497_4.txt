 so timeless in my opinion. 




 How could someone here tell you to just go and die...

I feel the same. I'm stuck here and everything else around me is kind of moving forward. Got my high-school diploma in my pocket for over two years now and I'm trying to make it to uni for one and a half year now to study social work, but the expectations are high (and my average too bad). Oh and I'm social phobic, which makes everything a bit worse. 


What I'm acutally trying to say is that it's not that easy to completely ignore the outside factors, since we are quite on the emotional side and I definitely understand your desire to just move away and leave all these negative things behind. 
Maybe we should both do things step by step, plan little things and not all at once, so we don't hold ourselves back, because we think nothing's not gonna work anyway. J. K. Rowling (writer of the Harry Potter books, in case you didn't know) once said: "It is impossible to live without failing at something, unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all - in which case, you fail by default." 

I'm definitely keeping this in mind.



(Sorry for any mistakes. Lack of sleep and English is not my native language) 




 I'd go as Poison Ivy, or as kind of like a chic vampire..
But I'm probably going to stay at home, make myself some tea and watch a nice movie like "Sweeney Todd", "The Nightmare Before Christmas" or "Sleepy Hollow".  




 I've seen that, it looks beautiful. :) But haven't tried it yet! 
Most of the time I prefer black tea with milk. But when I need something fancy, I drink a mixture of teas which are made by a "herb witch" (she calls herself like that) here in our village. One of my favourites among these is called "chimney fire".
