 I looked through the old request threads and all previous links are dead. 

Thanks in advance to anyone who can help!  




 Can we please get a PS4 bundle that doesn't just include last gen games? Argh.  




 Hey all, we've passed the midpoint of NaNoWriMo. Everyone should be tracking to 31K words to keep to the 1,667 words per day average count. If not, no worries, just keep writing!   




 But on Hannibal you expect that sort of violence due to the show's characters and stories and themes. Whereas here it's definitely unexpected.  




 I thought Grant was finally validated in his life long belief that his brother ruined his life by claiming that Grant did that to their other brother, which then led to a series of other misfortune events that landed him in juvie and eventually with Hydra in the first place. I think he genuinely still cares for his SHIELD mates, at least Skye for any matter, and secretly hates the Hydra part of himself. But it's so engrained into his identity and who he is, that he can't detach himself from it. So that was the ultimate moment for Ward - to finally get his brother to acknowledge that he was ultimately the "cause" for all of Ward's problems/current state in his life.  




 I really thought they were going to go for a Titanic-esque scene with the car window. Such a missed opportunity. 
 




 For real. 

Though, I think Marvel just needs to make their movies a little longer to accommodate for villain character development time.   




 I think the reveal of Whitehall and Skye's father's back story was the best. Definitely lends some sympathy to the character of Skye's father.  




 I like all the tie in's and references to the MCU. Fury, Tesseract, Red Skull, Agent Carter, Howling Commandos, etc.  




 Agreed, I can't believe they straight up showed Whitehall dissecting Skye's mom. :/  




 Wonder if they are already in cahoots.  




 She has such an awesome name. But I just refer to her as Sierra.  




 I really really thought Ward was going push his brother down that well when they were hugging it out.  




 Could be Bobbi or Simmons. Especially with that brainwashing comment from earlier in the ep. And then the trust comments at the end of the ep between Hunter and Bobbi.  




 Needs to be more integral to the plot. Like Fury will be like "yada yada, we'll need the Director of SHIELD for this." and everyone will be like "but isn't that you?" 

/cut to reveal of Coulson, "did you guys miss me?"  




 Wonder if it's possible Simmons or Bobbi did actually get brainwashed by Hydra and has been leaking intel to Hydra... Hydra did know they were coming after all. 

That brainwashing comment they made earlier in the ep makes me suspicious.  




 Dafaq... Grant and his brothers argument and then subsequent reconciliation just makes them both seem ridiculously pathological. 

Also, I cant tell if Ward actually killed his brother or not. Either way he's ridiculously good at this bad guy thing.  




 *Shes not here is she? Phew, thats a relief. You only get one chance to make a first impression.*

*The end justifies the means.* 

Yikes. Poor Skye - you really dont get choose your family. Though at least they've finally explained the back story here so he doesn't seem like a complete psychopath. 
 




 *"Am I good with this in my pocket?"*

*"That depends - do you ever want to have kids?"* 
 




 And I thought there was going to be some big reveal where Skyes father eventually finds out the gnarly stuff that Whitehall did to Skyes mother and then kill him off for us in a fit of rage. Guess he already knew. Oof... this is going to get bloody.  




 Awww Skyes real papa and adopted papa getting territorial. So cute. 
 




 *"He could always see five steps ahead, which was impressive for a one-eyed man."*

I love how Coulson inspires to be a better director by studying Fury. I really hope he reprises his role in one of the future MCU movies. I would love to see the look on all the Avengers faces. 
 




 *We get closer. You get scared.*

*Will you never trust me?"* 

*"No, but Ill never stop wanting to.*

/cue angry sex. Don't ever change Bobbi and Hunter. 
 




 Oh hello Sierra - I was wondering when some Whedon favorites would start showing up.  




 Happy cheerful cute whimsical games please... I just did a 60+ hour work week dealing with all sorts of stressful shit and difficult people... 

Also, a baked potato.  




 I'll be there. With some food.  




 I think Black Widow would kick his butt too. She's probably picked up a few things hanging out/fighting with the Avengers/superhero crowd too.  




 10/10 would watch  




 Maybe he was going for the so gaudy and flashy no way it's a secret agent in disguise  




 I think they can lay some groundwork there. 

Though what I'm really hoping for is: AoS - Inhumans - Kree - GoG - Starlord guest stars on an ep of AoS... lol.  




 If this is actually true, this sounds amazing.  




 That rolled right off her tongue.  




 I think it's great that they're integrating more with the overall MCU. Nothing wrong with fleshing out some back story.  




 I just want Skye to gain her Inhuman powers and be awesome.  




 Would love to see a showdown between the two on the big screen.  




 I think he'll go after his brother, but I don't think it'll lead to any redemption. His brother will probably just be revealed to be an even bigger cunt than Ward, just as he suggested to Coulson.  




 Please can this happen?  




 RIP Beardy McTraitoson 

...coming soon to a small screen near you: Fratricide McTraitorson. 
 




 *"Corpsey Diem. Seize the dead"*

So nice to see the Fitz we all know and love back for a moment. 




 Ughh... that one lady died from the shock from the carving. That's a terrible way to go. 
 




 Oh Mack way to be unintentionally racist against Skye. :/ Wonder if the team will eventually be driven apart after Skye's reveal or possibly events of Civil War down the road.   




 Man, Coulson going off the deep end is scary as SHIT (and bad ass). Too bad it only lasted about 5 minutes. 
 




 *Subtlety is the key* 

*You were wearing a cowboy hat!* 

Please keep this Bobbi and Hunter banter up. I need more.  




 Nooooooo RIP Beardy McTraitoson 




 Oh Mack way to be unintentionally racist against Skye.  




 Subtlety is the key... 

You were dressed liked a cowboy!!  




 Holy shit Coulson goes off the deep end. 




 Ughh... she died from shock from the carving. That's a terrible way to go.  




 I don't think the Straw Valley Cafe exists as the eclectic and awesome hang out it used to be anymore. They've overhauled it into an upscale-ish restaurant (with a "cafe and wine bar") from what I hear.  




 SUCH a good episode! Please have Gina and Boyle find out midseason about their parents (only after some more build up and sneaking around).  




 Hey! Thanks for doing this! I have a few very basic questions. I'm trying to learn how to use Unity and some general programming overall. I've taken a very basic Java   C++ class before and I used to do some stuff in Ruby for RPG maker, so I have some rudimentary programming skills, but have a lot to learn. 

I'm trying to make a simple text /interactive fiction game which ideally I would want to look something like Twine (http://twinery.org/), but wrapped in some sort of GUI with point/click ability and background graphics. 

Just want some pointers on where to start/begin researching with something like this? I'd like to start with creating something like this maybe (except without the need for the room based map): 
http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/tidy-text-adventures-editor-tool-for-creating-text-based-adventure-games.164625/ 

I've never done anything like this and would just like a few pointers on where to begin. I'm not asking for an in depth tutorial or anything like that, just something like "you should read about x   y (ie parsing, etc) and how it ties into z (creating GUI, etc)". 

Thanks!   




 Yup - glad to know my parents are the only ones who do this. 

When I was slightly overweight (on Asian standards mind you which meant I was like +5-10 lbs from my "ideal" weight = "holy shit you're so fat how are you ever going to get married" all the time. 

Then I went backpacking in Europe for a month and lost about 5-10 lbs = next time my parents saw me "holy shit we think you have a wasting disease you should go to the hospital to get that checked out". 

You literally cannot win. 
 




 I'm a little behind too... just shy of 6K right now. Boss is visiting from out of town so my evenings are being taken up with work related events. 

I'm writing a collection of short stories this year for NaNo though so I haven't stalled out due to anything plot related yet. Woot.  




 How's everyone's NaNo going? Remember to achieve the 50,000 words by the end of the month, you need to write an average of 1,667 words a day! 

If you're looking for extra motivation or a writing buddy, try hitting up one of your local NaNo events.  




 WTF is wrong with these companies? Who's actually going to go shopping on Thanksgiving Day?  




 Sigh... I have both GTA V and TLOU for PS3. Come on Black Friday ads, there must be a better deal.  




 Just realized I didn't actually RSVP. I'll be there.  




 Second this. I do 425 (convection - use 450 for normal bake) for 12-15 minutes. Comes out perfect every time.  




 Looks hilarious.  




 They act like it and also just referring to the one undercover episode. They made a hilarious married couple.  




 Nooo.... but Keanu! 




 He thinks he could somehow "win" his way back to the team. That or Skye's father is offering some serious rewards for getting Skye back to him.  




 It was so bittersweet when she walked in on him and Mac's bro moment too.  




 Or zip ties or duck tape even. Lot harder to get out of than loose handcuffs.  




 Dude he is such a deluded fuck. I loved how Coulson just handed his ass to him. 

You betrayed every single one of us. The only reason youre still alive is because you were of use.  




 I thought he was going to somehow play enough mind game on Skye and she was going to help him get out to find her father. This did seem like a cop out way for him to get out though.  




 Thor almost shat his pants.  




 Coulson does NOT approve of the Grumpy Cat mug. LOL.  




 Man, englishman can get away with such ridiculous dialogue: *That face is so dour.* 

No American could say that in RL.  




 Peter! Stop being such a dick to SHIELD/morally ambiguous character, you probably need to go chase after Neal Caffrey instead.  




 Ok that fight between May and that dude was pretty good. However silly that chain knife thing was, it made for a pretty cool fight scene.  




 *You betrayed every single one of us. The only reason youre still alive is because you were of use.*

So. Cold. But Ward is a deluded **fuck**. Im glad theyre committed to going down this evil!Ward path.  

Also, Coulson referred to Fitz and Simmons as FitzSimmons! 
 




 Were really digging into this weekly Married Misadventures of Agents of SHIELD. 

First May   Coulson now Lance   Bobbi. 

Love it. Keep the jabs coming.  




 *This poor sap is believing every word shes saying. She always makes them feel so special*

Aww Lance and you gave her your nanas pearl earrings. Then she broke your heart. Aww, poor baby.   




 *So youve been telling everyone Im a hell beast.*

*No no I dont believe I used those exact words.* 




 I officially love Lance and Bobbi: 

*This is you peacocking.* 

*Who uses the word peacocking?"*  

*You just love the sound of your own voice.*  




 It seems like there was a lot of groundwork laid in this episode for what Im presuming is going to be Superhuman Registration and Civil War.  




 Also it was hilarious when Tony and Rhodey were both trying to lift it.  




 That he did.  




 Beginning of that trailer SO hilarious.  




 Peter! Stop being a dick to SHIELD, you probably need to go chase after Neal Caffrey.  




 Wait ex-wife? I missed something!!  




 Will be there at 3. I'm about to leave the house now.  




 Update: might be running a wee bit late due to some work stuff. Shouldn't be more than 30-45 minutes at most. (fingers crossed)  




 In lieu of the normal 52 Week Writing Challenge, I will be taking this week to prep for NaNoWriMo which starts next week. For the month of November, we will take a short break from normal format and track 50K words for NaNoWriMo. Happy writings everyone!  




 Thanks. It will be eventually. :/  




 I'll be there. I'll bring **Mansions of Madness**. It's been languishing since I got it (almost) 4 years ago, hopefully you guys will want to give it a twirl. 
/u/r2d8 getinfo 




 I'll be there. I'll figure out some fall themed food to bring and will update this post then.  




 The rain and gloom here as really helped with the writing atmosphere. Nothing better to do at night than to buckle down and crank out the pages.

 Also how was she NOT completely suspicious when Coulson started "reminiscing" about the past just as they're about to walk into the hotel room?  




 Me too. Loved his reaction at the end too.

*"I did what now?"*

*"I mean a painting Coulson? And you weren't immediately suspicious it wasn't me?"* 




 It's those Asian genes I'm telling you: http://i.imgur.com/SeHM7.jpg 




 Me too. Loved his reaction at the end too. 

*"I did what now?"*

*"I mean a painting Coulson? And you weren't immediately suspicious it wasn't me?"* 




 Or rather, a molestache.  




 Also Hyrda needs to teach their agents how to properly restrain downed SHEILD agents. Especially the Cavalry.  




 *Inter-human relations are hard. I was a human and she was a demonic hell beast.*

Lance's ex is really intriguing me. All the delicious hints they keep dropping! 
 




 *I spent 5 months in an enemy camp, you people make me miss those times.*  

Talbots starting to grow on me.  




 Best description of Beardy McTraitorson yet: 

At least your ex isnt the psycho living in our basement.  
  




 I cant believe Im the only one seeing this right now.  




 I LOLed so hard at Coulsons wire evading pose. Its too bad May ruined it.  




 What is THAT? 

Thats May laughing I think the worst of it is almost over.  




 I would pay $500 for a pair of flats right now. 

My face hurts. 

Were modern. 

Plus all of her little digs at Coulson when they were undercover. 

Man, this episode was pure May gold.  




 Can we pleeease have a web series spin off called the Married Mis-adventures of May and Coulson detailing all of their undercover operations?  




 Ming-Na Wen is looking *damn* fine for a 50 year old lady.  




 Probably will be an hour late but might not make it either tbh. Sorry to be flaky... got some personal stuff going on right now.  




 I feel like they're setting up Brandon Routh's character as her new love interest... I just don't know how I feel about that. RIP Olicity :(  




 Fitz was kind of scary in that scene. I had almost wished they just showed Fitz passively watching Ward suffocate for a bit longer and then "allowing" him to live.  




 Only if Coulson yells "You're Fired!" to a Hydra agent hanging off a missile that he fires into an unfinished skyscraper.  




 Haha very plausible timeline. 

Also, sometime between the events of True Lies and Agents of Shield Harry Tasker trains a young Phil Coulson in the art of tango.  




 I've been in the van for 15 years, Harry.  




 I'm really excited to see Simmons infiltrating the inner sanctum of Hydra in the coming weeks. Looking forward to her possible interactions with Agent 33 as well. I'm sure she's going to work on a way to combat the brainwashing/compliance for both Agent 33 and herself. I'm sure her cover is going to get blown eventually and they're going to try and brainwash her except at that point she'll already have developed a way to fight it. 

That or we're going to get a couple of episodes of some really awesome EvilMadScientist!Simmons.  




 "Everything I did, I did of my own free will." Evil!Ward forever!  

Also yay we're advancing the Skye's father plot line! Too bad that's totally how Ward's gonna get free. Mark my words, Syke's gonna decide that breaking him out is a good idea.  




 Ha, after all the speculation last week, turns out Fitz knew he was hallucinating Simmons the entire time.  




 Psst Whedons... we like this burgeoning MacFitz bromance. Please don't kill or do something otherwise horrible to Mac.  




 That confrontation between Fitz and Ward was so powerful and absolutely heartbreaking. It's tragic to think of the consequences that Ward's betrayal has had on the team. Gone is the gentle and innocent boy scientist - replaced instead by this broken bitter man. Iain De Caestecker absolutely killed it in that scene - just the right amount of hyperventilation, fear, and barely restrained anger. 

Also, Ward is a manipulative shitbag. "It's good to see you Fitz?" Evil!Ward forever.  




 LOL May and Coulson going undercover next week looks absolutely hilarious. Like straight up True Lies style.
 




 Wow didn't realize Fitz knew Simmons wasn't really there the entire time. That was fast. Also, the confrontation between Ward and Fitz happened waaaay earlier than I thought it would.  




 Boooo Simmons is actually still working for Shield. I wanted a giant story twist!  




 I'm surprised Hydra lets Simmons live out in the real world. I feel like you should keep all of your top scientists on lock down... for their own safeties' sake you know.  




 Rate my thread a 1, rate James' a 10... how is that not rude?

 You are the rudest. 




 Agreed. :/
