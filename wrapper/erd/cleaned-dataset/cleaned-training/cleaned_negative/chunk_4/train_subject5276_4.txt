 are you dumb? 




 get better 




 that would make it extremely easy to get guns, which isnt good for dayz 




 its bad 




 Basically playing lone wolf is boring and nothing ever gets done. If you are interested in contacting me my steam name is Microbyte with a RS 2007 elf as the profile picture. I prefer teamspeak, but i can work with skype.  









 Do you think this would be a good idea for a map?

the image is taken from http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=5343 with some slight adjustmants to orientation. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. (This map is only for me to see the tepography, i already have a basic version of it here: http://imgur.com/CGxj8CQ ) 




 how many times are people going to comment dumb shit that was confirmed to be coming like a year ago 




 its more than one per server. most likely wont increase, its meant to be very difficult to get a ghillie 









 thanks man! 




 So i want to have crates from maps like Dust2 and Inferno, but i dont know how to get them into my map. can anybody help me out? Thanks! 




 Here is a link to the original post: http://www.reddit.com/r/hammer/comments/2o40wm/first_csgo_map_idea/

Hope you like it, if you have any feedback, let me know. I will have it up on the workshop soon (i think) 




 alright man ill keep that in mind! 




 i tried to start it yesterday, but i dont know much so didnt continue, but i do plan on starting soon 




 what if i added some double doors and boxes to inhibit the t's view of b: http://imgur.com/k6xPYNi 




 maybe i could put a wall there from T to a tunnles and have a hole with something to break like in mirage to mid/window,  and also at the windows at mid: http://imgur.com/PX2ncic 




 i have Hammer and plan to start making it sometime soon, but i just got it and dont know much :/ 




 So i made this in like 45 mins because it seems like fun to make maps for people to play. If you have any tips for improvement like cover/sniper nests/etc. it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

 if you didnt care what people thought, you wouldn't have posted it to reddit. 




 im tired of these "wah wah somebody killed me this game sucks" posts. seriously, its annoying. nobody cares that you found somebody in cherno and looted up then died.
