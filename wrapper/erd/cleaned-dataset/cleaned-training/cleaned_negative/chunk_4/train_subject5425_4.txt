 My honest guess at this is that the black guy who was carrying the concealed weapon would have been shot by the police when they arrived. 




 I guess all politics aside, I would feel uncomfortable attending a church where people felt the need to carry a weapon. 




 I think they also underestimate how Bernie can motivate people to vote.  Hillary is just the same ole same ole...Bernie gives you something to vote FOR not against. 




 So the solution is.....more guns? 




 Why don't they have HRC on and start asking her questions about Bernie Sanders and his stance on the issues? 




 Thanks for the heads up! 




 This needs to go viral! 




 Just when you think you couldn't love him even more.... 




 Watched and shared 









 WTF???? 




 yes, but that was BEFORE he talked to his corporate donors, they gave him the go ahead
 




 Thanks for the link...took me about 2 minutes to email both of my Senators 




 Happy dance!
 




 Seriously, this guy is running for President? 




 whoops...she really meant to say the people of SC, not her bosses the CEOs /s 




 i love this idea!! Pint of whatever for me, donate that same amount to bernie 




 hmmm...how about a pint for me and a pint for Bernie...donate the cost of a pint of ice cream to his campaign....
or maybe a pint for me, and a pint for the Revolution
 




 Hillary Hate is rampant in the Republican party.  Did you know there is actually a PAC called stop hillary now and their one goal is to end Hillary Clintons Political career??? 




 Power to the People! Go Bernie! 




 Go Bernie!
