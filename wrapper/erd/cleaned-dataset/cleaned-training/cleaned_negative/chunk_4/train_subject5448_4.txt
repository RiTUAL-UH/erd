 I can't be the only one who thought when they said "shots fired at NSA" there was a heated argument at the offices of NSA 




 I bet she was like, "Damn my niece is crazy wanting to kill me, my fianc, her cousin, and WHAT THE FUCK THIS BITCH WANTS THE DOG DEAD?!"  




 "You just downloaded   opened this app, tell us what you think!"  




 I would love for some random bloke to find it and do something extravagant with it. 




 I've never been so jealous  




 This is the future.  




 COMPLETELY off topic, but how'd you get into commercials? I want/need to start, but don't know where to.. Thanks man!  




 the person who just died just saw the light and then came back from it.  




 Love when things just never get old in Lucid Dreams
