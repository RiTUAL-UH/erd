 You're right. I think it is all between the ears. Hope he finds his groove again. Makes for exciting golf.  




 I am old and grew up on the Saturday morning cartoons (Super Friends, Scooby, Hong Kong Phooey, Captain Caveman, etc.) so I have love for these cartoons.  Later watched Voltron, Transformers, and He-Man.  Even in high school watched the Disney toons like Duck Tails, Dark Wing Duck, etc.  As an adult never missed an episode of JLU, BAS, The Batman.  I now have four kids and we watch Adventure Time, Regular Show, Teen Titans Go, Gravity Falls and Gumball.  I find these shows to be hilarious.  Much funnier than the shows I grew up on as a child.

 I'm the same way. A little older (42) but action figures and matchbox cars were my go to as a child.  I still collect action figures despite my wife's ribbing about it.  We shouldn't let our wives meet.
