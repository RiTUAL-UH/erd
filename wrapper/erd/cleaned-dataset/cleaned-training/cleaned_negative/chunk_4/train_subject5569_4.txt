 Bootstrap paradox.  Unless you're a fifth dimensional being from Interstellar. 




 My parents attempted to raise me Lutheran.  But, they also raised me to be intelligent and to think for myself.  And what I have come to think for myself is that all religion is bullshit, useful for controlling the masses and that's about it.  I have no use for it.  This, I'm an atheist.  But, I don't go around with an "Ask me about my Atheism" button on. 




 I have no idea...I don't do theming, sorry. 




 What BT issues are you having?  Everyone's been reporting all good on the 11/27 invisiblek build., I personally have fully functional BT (no smartwatch though, just car audio/calls and an ihome speaker).

 CM12, unofficial invisiblek 27 Nov build.  Few minor bugs but fine for a daily driver for an experienced user.  Before that was running Vanir and Jasmine. 




 Actually, in the US, some states have no statute for female rape.  In Maryland, for example, it's legally impossible for a woman to rape a man.  Which is absurd, frankly. 




 I guess you've never heard of a multimode seeker or offboard guidance.  "lol". 




 Yeah, because all SAMs have active onboard radar guidance.  That's the oooonly type of guidance system out there...

 Frequency.  That's the one word that breaks that two paragraphs of, "it's impossible, it's impossible, because physics." 




 Me personally, there isn't one.  I don't use my phone for watching video.  My point was that the phone sitting with the screen turned on and otherwise not doing anything doesn't represent a useful scenario.  If someone was reading or watching a show there'd be processor activity, touchscreen activity, etc.  In this case there was none of that, which is why it is meaningless. 




 Yes, I'm aware, that's why I used the word "could".  I was speaking in generalities. 




 Had a similar thing happen years ago with my old GTO.  Square indent into the hood several inches long, clearly from a lifted truck.  People suck. 




 Incredibly misleading given that the screen was on with no activity due to your having fallen asleep.  Not representative of any real world scenario. 




 It's pretty easy to see rocket launches from hundreds of miles away...And one that's leaving orbit would be very easy given it's local trajectory could be straight up rather than curving to make an orbit...

 I think you have misperceived the intent of my comments, but that's ok.  There was never an implication of joking.  In fact, I'm not even disagreeing with you, or taking this seriously as you seem to be. 




 Down by the river?  Private engagements, chilling in a van...it all makes sense now!

 If by home every Saturday you mean I'm not sitting lonely in a bar silently crying into my martini, you'd be correct.  I have the love of a good woman and have no need to "party" as you seem to.  Maturity's a wonderful thing. 




 The whole "come get me ladies" shtick doesn't sound too introverted to me... 




 I work for the US DoD as the lead production engineer for a major weapon system.  I have been in my current role about two years but have been with DoD for 11.5 years.

If there's one thing I don't strictly like about my job, it'd be the near total dependency on people outside myself who work with/for me and are not as detail oriented or efficient, but that is the nature of teamwork and leadership. 




 Clearly you are in the wrong MBTI subreddit.  Or you're full of shit. 




 I want many things, but I don't need anything I don't already have. So, I'm asking folks to not get me anything.  I've hidden my wishlist on Amazon and the only gift I'm giving is to my girlfriend, and it's already bought. 




 This article's a month old on that very subject...

 No, end users well more than likely not see any impact. 




 Actually I totally respect TCF's position in this.  I'm shocked at the other guy who basically said "I want X, so F you guys I'm releasing it."  F'ing children.

 I didn't interpret your wink to be related to the time, but to the idea he'd be over it, given it's placement at the end of your post rather than in the middle.  My bad. 




 It's only been that long for people on Earth... 




 The G3 is a world phone - and the Verizon version is not locked to Verizon.  It can even be used on T-Mobile. 




 No.   I've never had an answer to that question.  




 I think repair wise as long as it's a reputable shop you'll be OK.

And, thanks for your service.   




 Why do I feel like a just read an ad posted by some investment firm's BD guy? 




 RES has a little button that makes pics appear on the portal page, so you don't have to click the post. 




 What did the other side look like?  The damage in the pic definitely doesn't look like enough to have totaled it like you seemed to expect?

Also, are you USMC/Retired?  (CHMSL sticker.)

 Yeah, um, where are his marbles?  I can't be the only one wondering. 




 If only these geniuses spoke the same language as the rest of us, they'd realize what an enormous misunderstanding this was.  Oh, to be a fly on the wall in the courtroom and/or judge's chambers. 




 Done with your tantrum?  Good. 




 Not true.  You sure you have a BRZ?  Tuning helps immensely and even small changes make a difference.  Grimmspeed proved even panel filters make more power.  The data is all over ft86club. 




 Yep, and they can provide a tune for the GS intake now as well (currently have to put in an email request as it's not on the website yet). 




 Opinions are neither correct nor incorrect - they are merely one person's impressions.  The OP is correct in their own experience.  Doesn't mean they're wrong  




 B...b...b...ut....?  Standardized tests!  No Child Left Behind!  If students can choose for themselves schools might not get the funding they want to keep their mediocre tenured teachers employed! 




 I love that you think OP is wrong because his/her opinion is different from your own.  I had a lot of teachers like you back in the day.

 Reading this just makes me sad. 




 Eeeeh.  Incorrect.  All Verizon LTE phones are fully unlocked.  As required by the FCC.  I can take my LG G3 and put it on any GSM provider in the US.  Ditto for my girlfriend's iPhone. 




 A majority of major smartphones now carry transceivers for both GSM and CDMA.  Your statement isn't accurate in all cases any longer.  Samsung, LG, Motorola, Apple, just to name a few.... 




 Your friend needs to lay off the 5 minute Physics lectures on Youtube.  That was horrid.  It is word vomit, brain stew, meaningless drivel.  It looks like something that came out of a document layout testing algorithm.  Lorem ipsum, or perhaps this:

 I'm more interested in how you managed to get a rough red Mammoth from Anarchy Motive in your hands...I'm still waiting on mine.  Looks like it might've shipped today or will shortly from the last GB on FT86. 




 For my text tone at one point I used Jezza exclaiming "I've got a text" after they'd texted someone celebrity woman on the show.  It'd get pretty annoying in a long conversation though. You might say, it would be the most annoying text tone...in the world. 




 I usually get them onto my phone via Dropbox after I've edited them in Audacity. 




 This is what I use.  For the incredibly rare occasions I'm not on vibrate only.

I edited the ringtone so that it loops perfectly over what would be the "chorus" of the song if it was the original version. 




 Looks like top row is Dual Link DVI-D; bottom row is Display Port; HDMI; Dual Link DVI-I. 




 Do not accept the update until it's been confirmed to be rootable.  You might lose root updating even if you had it before.

 Ball for scale! 




 There's a big difference between "saving the world" and saving humanity.  "Saving the world" was never part of the plan. 




 How do you explain the point of view of the Ranger maintenance tech coming and finding one missing at the end?  We're not following any other character around at that point... 




 Black holes don't have infinite mass.  The singularity has infinite density, as it has a given mass in a zero volume.  But it has whatever mass the star that collapsed to form it had (minus what was blown off obviously) plus whatever it's absorbed.  Unless they are interdimensional portals or something...

 It's a bug between Chrome 39 and AOSP ROMs on ALL devices.  And Chrome 39 went live for non-beta yesterday so we're all stuck with it apparently until Lollipop comes around.

 The gravitational anomaly causes the movement.  If taken apart I think the second hand would be like a Mexican jumping bean. 




 In this context, there is no distinction.  However, "film" is not a proper noun and is not capitalized in the middle of a sentence.  Now take a deep breath and go on about your day. 




 Was the power supply in distress? 




 You think a MOVIE is a milestone comparable to landing human beings on a rock 250,000 miles away and bringing them back safely?  I think you might need to reevaluate that thought process.  The movie was good, I'll grant you that.  But, at that level?  I think not. 




 You're not thinking 5th dimensionally, Marty. 




 My thought as well.  The data was permanently encoded into the watch. 




 Other than Yuzu on the Release Series 1.0 the same colors are available.  It's called Galaxy Blue on the BRZ. 




 Yeah, all too true. 




 Eh? 




 He was a cocky bastard in his youth too.  Wisdom and humility come with age, experience and loss. 




 Oh I would love to hop back in a Chopper, crank the CCR and drop into the DMZ again with a new engine.  A helo with a full load of grunts acting on mission rather than just hopping out near the top of a tall building... 




 Absolutely.  It's the in-universe equivalent thereof.  But instead of showing off one state or country's ingenuity, it shows off Stark's. 




 Data: She brought me closer to humanity than I ever thought possible, and for a time...I was tempted by her offer.
Jean-Luc Picard: How long a time?

 Went through the first 200 comments and saw one female couple and one male couple.  Females had positive comments on their; males had only negative.  Jeez I hate people.

 So for me in DC at the Smithsonian everyone applauded, which I personally have never experienced before.  Also, I think throughout the film it was the quietest I've ever experienced. 




 A bit tired of crapping in this thread, but, it means, you're a keyboard jockey who reads Jane's, and I'm a defense specialist. 




 I'll take that under advisement; however, civilians will never understand. 




 We'll just have to agree to disagree on that one. 




 You must not remember Daikatana 




 Arguing about fighter generations is like arguing whether the Xbone or PS4 is more next gen.  Pointless.

 Bing!  It might help developers somewhat but honestly it's not very relevant until there's a wider release.  Plus it's already been posted about all over the place here on Reddit.
