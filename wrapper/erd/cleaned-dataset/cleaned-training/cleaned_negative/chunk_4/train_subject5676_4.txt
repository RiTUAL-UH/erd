 I love reading! It has always played a massive part in my life. I've been writing a lot since around the age of 15. I am now 18 and I'm editing my first novel.  A good friend of mine is editing helping me and she is overwhelmingly positive. though when I read my work, I find it hard to not compare it to the books that I love, which are always significantly better. I"m wondering if others feel this way about there writing? And if so, how do you approach these feelings? 
 




 I would say don't give up on the idea of survivors if that is what you want, it may seem that there is no way but perhaps there is  a way which will think up while you're in the shower one day. Its always ok to rewrite the ending. Also I think a less depressing kill everyone off would be something whereby everyone devoted their resources to the survival of a specific individual or everyone collectively just sits down in one another's arms and accepts their fate.  




 Thank you for your honesty. I Think this is a really great example of how a work of fiction can provoke some major change within people and their perceptions of the world.  




 My Grandfather loved Nevil Shute! I believe they exchanged letters for a small period of time in the late 50s. My grandfather was an engineer as well and would not read any other fiction. 




 For me personally it would be the novels of Aldous Huxley, Disgrace by J.M. Coetzee, and Chuck Palahniuk's Lullaby. All of these have changed the way I see the world and I find it strange, that I once had not been influenced by them.
