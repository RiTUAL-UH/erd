 If indeed he took your phone and you say you've never been there you shouldn't be worried about going to the police. If you haven't been to that house never in your life then there's no evidence putting you there. Clear your phone's location and call the police. I'm worried about your friend OP, I think your neighbor might have to do with him disappearing. Worry about your friend and call the police! Don't be a shitty friend twice.  









 Very interesting OP, keep us updated.  









 Any update coming soon?
