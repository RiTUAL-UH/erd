 One of the few situations where I dont mind being trans. Gettin my insider information from my undercover years~~~ 




 I could care less about all these word crimes. 




 My mom spent most of her 40s trying to look younger. It was rather amusing, but she never went to the extremes yours did.

I referred to her as "Susan" after the character from the Narnia books who does just that :) 




 Oh yea, I get tons of these. I'm worse than most, as almost anything reminding me of my mom sends me into a full blown panic attack. And I'm talking normal stuff like hugging, the song "Let it go" and the scent of roses.

Triggers are common, very common. How you deal with them is up to you, but for most people it required external help. The first step, as usual, is recognizing the problem.

Good luck!
