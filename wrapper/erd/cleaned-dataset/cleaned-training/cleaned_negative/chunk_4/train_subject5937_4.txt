  The different 'races' however are entirely cosmetic

Re transsexuals - great answer.

Re race - it is not entirely cosmetic. It is largely cultural. While the racial experience is not even close to universal, there are cultural aspects that are generally ingrained in how one relates to ones race.

If one identifies culturally with a race that does not match their "cosmetics", then why can they not choose be be of that "race"?

 Legal experts said they're often surprised that people who comment online, even younger Internet users who've grown up online, seem to believe they're protected.

"In my experience with speaking with groups, and even speaking with some students, they seem to believe they will be protected when they speak on the Internet because they choose to use some fictitious name," Tulane University law professor Amy Gajda said.

Illinois' opinion was based in large part on a pair of earlier, lower-court decisions in the state, which held that the anonymity of someone who makes comments in response to online news stories isn't guaranteed if their opinions are potentially defamatory, according to Don Craven, an attorney for the Illinois Press Association.

"It's not that you get to say whatever the heck you want to say and you're going remain anonymous," Craven said.

A 3-way lamp, also known as a tri-light, is a lamp that uses a 3-way light bulb to produce three levels of light in a low-medium-high configuration. A 3-way lamp requires a 3-way bulb and socket, and a 3-way switch.

 In America there is a history of various terms that have been used such as negro, black, Afro-american, African-american, colored, etc. Each has been "in favor" at various times, and each has had its difficulties. As an example the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) still goes by NAACP even though "colored" is rarely used any more.

 [Here's the website tracking 2013, 2014   2015](http://shootingtracker.com/wiki/Main_Page)

Have at it. 




  So every time a gang banger shoots at more than one person that's a mass shooting

This list is 4 or more shooting victims in one incident. If you dropped down to 2 or more the list would be enormous.  




 "Police say an overnight shooting in Savannah left one man dead and sent four other people to a hospital early Friday. Two of the shooting victims are children."

Yes, that is a mass shooting. 




 No - that is the definition of mass murder, not mass shooting.

For example, "in 2012, Travis Steed and others shot 18 people total. Miraculously, he only killed one. Under the incorrect definition of mass shooting, that event would not be considered a mass shooting! Arguing that 18 people shot during one event is not a mass shooting is absurd." 




 [Here is a list of sources for almost all of them](http://shootingtracker.com/wiki/Mass_Shootings_in_2015#cite_note-2)

The requirement for the list is that **four or more people are shot in a spree or setting** 




 1: 1/1/2015, Unknown, 5 injured, Memphis, TN

Five people were injured after being shot on a party bus traveling down Interstate 240 early New Year's Day.

The party bus drove to the Baptist East emergency room with five victims. **Two people were in extremely critical condition**.

(a quick Google found that one - I'll let you do the rest) 




 After reading this list, THAT was your reaction?

NO, many bullets hitting someone are:

Suicides

A child accidentally shooting a sibling, parent or friend

A gun owner surprised by a spouse, housemate or family member coming home

And many, many other single victim shootings.  




 An hour a day, plus 1/2 more on Saturday. 

That's way more than "average".

  Unfortunately most authors of such books are writing from the perspective that the USA only ever acts honestly, fairly and with appropriate consideration for everyone

As TIME editor-at-large and president of Eurasia group Ian Bremmer is more nuanced than "most".

[Here's an interview that give's a sense of Bremmer's approach](http://time.com/3843599/ian-bremmer-united-states-superpower-china/) 




 Ian Bremmers book "Three Choices for America's Role in the World" lays out these options:

**Independent America** argues that its time for Washington to declare independence from the responsibility to solve everyone elses problems. Instead, America should lead by example by investing in Americas enormous untapped potential.

**Moneyball America**  acknowledges that we cant manage every international challenge but asserts that we must defend U.S. interests wherever theyre threatened. Like the Oakland As general manager Billy Beane spending scarce capital only where it offered the most promising return.
 
**Indispensable America** insists that only Washington can promote the values on which global stability increasingly depends in our hyper-connected world. Turning inward would threaten Americas security and prosperity. 




 There's a big difference between "Zero Tolerance" and "One Punishment Fits All".

I don't have a problem with zero tolerance, as long as the punishment fits the crime. 

I do have a problem with punishing all violations in the same way.

This prank should not be tolerated (zero tolerance) but it should have a punishment that fits the crime, such as time spent contributing back to the school.

TLDR: **Zero Tolerance** can work if **The Punishment Fits The Crime**

 "Government by cliff is a recipe for disaster."

That's a quote from Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), not Rand Paul, though the two have long agreed about this principle. The Patriot Act expires at the end of May. "It's been three years since we've known this date is coming," Paul said. Why in hell hasnt there been a debate, with amendments, in the Senate? Why does Capitol Hill lurch from cliff to cliff, instead of actually do the job of governing?  




 FBI Director James Comey warned on Wednesday  Letting key portions of the Patriot Act expire at the end of the month would make it harder for the FBI to do its job.

GOOD - It should be hard for the FBI to invade American's privacy and take away our liberty. So quit whining and do the hard work. 




 Next you're going to tell me there's gambling in Casablanca.

What's next ... gay Priests?

 "This study seeks to look beyond the use of radiation pressure for thrust, and to explore a means of solar navigation whereby a solar craft would be steered by use of radiation pressure. The idea is based on a recent discovery by the study team. They found that transparent refractive objects may settle into a position where they feel a force that is perpendicular to the incoming light direction. This transverse force is akin to the lift experience by an airplane wing and other airfoils. Thus they call it optical lift. Objects in their experiments simultaneously thrust forward. The combination of lift and thrust allows for the optical steering of optical wings. In the coming year they will conduct experiments and computer modeling to advance this discovery for future space missions employing solar sails. The long-term goal is to devise a means to allow solar sails to navigate through space using only the power of sunlight. In the short term they will design and fabricate small-scale arrays of optical wings and test them in the laboratory to demonstrate the feasibility of the concept. They will also perform numerical modeling to determine optimal design parameters for optical wings."

 "solar sails do have their limitations. In our solar system, at distances beyond the orbit of Mars, the sun becomes too faint to push a solar sail, which limits their use deep in space, according to NASA."

 "All Along the Watchtower" even Bob Dylan changed the way he performed it after Jimi Hendrix did his superb version of this song.

We miss you Jimi!

 "A United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rocket thundered away from Cape Canaveral Wednesday, boosting **an unpiloted military spaceplane** into orbit for a secret mission. Hitching a ride on the Atlas were **10 small CubeSat spacecraft**, including **an experimental "LightSail" satellite** provided by the Planetary Society to test the feasibility of using sunlight for propulsion."
