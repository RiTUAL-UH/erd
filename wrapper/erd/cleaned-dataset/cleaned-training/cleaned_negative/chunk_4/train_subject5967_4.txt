 My bros did this to me years ago (don't worry, its a fun story).

We finished playing a drinking game which I won (or lost, either way you're fucked up drunk). In my victory dance I ended up puking in the garden. I then got the sudden drunk munchies. I remembered that I had a half eaten Whopper in my car. Success! So I got my keys out of my pocket and started stumbling towards my car to get my tasty treat.

2 of my mates saw a drunken friend with his keys out walking towards his car. I don't blame them for thinking I was going to drive ahaha.

So they both kind of accosted me and wrestled the keys off me. Even in my drunkness I knew how it appeared so I tried to dissuade them.

Unfortunately "*Don't worry guys, I'm not going to drive - I'm just getting some food from my car!*"

Became

"*Guyss.. I'm just going to get a burger*"

Yeah I couldn't communicate my needs very well and I got yelled at hahaha.


I passed out soon after and the fuckers put deep heat in my underwear.

I love my friends.

**TL:DR got drunk, wanted food from my car, got called out for drink driving, deep heated genitals** 




 You can date a bros sister, but the bro has to be consulted with. Most of the time this rule will result in a 'go ahead'. It's less about asking permission (we're all fucking adults here) and more about letting your bro know first. 




 This really is the only answer. 




 That scene from Pulp Fiction confuses me. I'm in Australia and we use the metric system as much as France, but we call it a quarter pounder with cheese. The change seems stupid. 




 You had me at *meat tornado* 




 This is pretty much all you can do. It hurt for a long time, 2 years with someone means there are a lot of things which remind you of them. But time was the only thing which healed it. 




 I made a post a while ago [about how my favourite hoodie](http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/360x02/nsv_whelp_i_really_liked_that_hoodie_oh_well_i/) had suddenly become more loose fitting. Being the master of causality that I am, I determined that losing weight causes clothing to become defective.

So I decided to go hoodie shopping this weekend. I saw a nice zip up hoodie but the only size left was an XL. 

I couldn't buy an XL, I've been in the 3XL category for as long as I remember.

I guess I was wrong, the XL was a really good fit. A quick look around showed that clothes that are baggy are not clothes that actually fit. Good times.

 




 I hate this.

Both me and her are very stubborn people. But we were the best of friends for near on a decade. Until August 2013. In Australia, that is the time of year that our Aussie rules football season heads into the finals. She is a life long Collingwood fan, to the uninitiated this means that she has a over the top reaction to anything about this team.

So anyway, while I was out with several other friends we got the news that Collingwood had been eliminated from the finals. So as a joke, we all decided to coordinate a simultanious Facebook message to her

"Hey X, the power went out where we are, how did Collingwood go?"

That was it. It was a fucking joke. 

Anyway. We all immediately got removed from Facebook and she didn't return any of my calls or sms's. 

We've not meet up since. I'm not apologising. if she is willing to destroy a friendship because of a joke about a football team, then that speaks to her willingness to being my friend. 




 You're absolutely right. It's really easy to end up making a sub be upwards of 1000+ calories.

I have now adjusted what I get there down to around 800 calories. Mostly by removing the cheese and choosing better meat. 




 Most commercially sold Ice Tea. That shit is basically sugar water. 




 **REDDIT GOLD FOR EVERYONE!** 




 Procrastinating. You're about to start a new level of education and that nonsense won't hold up. 

As corny as it sounds, it's your future - don't fuck it up over laziness. 




 Me too, crossing guards are so touchy. 




 'Would' also adds a hypothetical nature to the question. 

*Would you please take out the trash?*

*Yes, I would* 

The trash is now hypothetically dealt with. 




 Ah good, it's nice to hear that the weight fluctuation can last only a few days. 




 I think that's the case now, that I've 'gained' weight. So the 1 pound loss I've registered is *actually* like a 3 pound weekly loss 




 I'm doing daily weigh ins, I wan't to see that *whoosh* happen!

So you've had a flux of weight every time you've been sore? 




 Hey guys

So I just finished a long weekend and I decided to challenge myself by going to the gym every day during it. I would normally workout twice a week on the weekends (45 minutes of cardio). This time around I did 4 straight days of cardio workouts with the Saturday session going for a full hour followed by my first bout with body resistance training.

Needless to say I'm still rather sore from the resistance training. After all of this, my weigh in yesterday showed that I'd only lost 1 pound for the week, which is smaller than usual.

So with all of that information, how likely is it that my weight has been fudge'd due to water retention? 




 I like the Stannis meltdown, it shows that the Mannis circle jerk can be broken.

To be honest, we all knew this was coming and while !book Stannis stated quite early on that there will be no burnings, that was said before he was desperate. 

The Bolton sabotage (while kinda of lazy writing wise) felt like an adaptation of some sort of set back that's coming up in the books, a set back which would make Stannis desperate. 




  **Killing Them Softly**, I made a thread about it yesterday. It looks like lots of people loved it too, but I got quite a few messages from people who have not seen it because of the reviews which is a crying shame. 

Do yourself a favour and check it out :) 




 IM SO FUCKING PSYCHED!! I had the biggest smile while watching this 




 It ended up with a 75% on RT, which isn't representative of the quality I think. I would've guessed 90%~ 




 Hey everyone,

While I'm an avid movie lover, there are still lots of films I've missed out on enjoying. Killing Them Softly is one of those movies. Thanks to Netflix I was able to watch it last night and it was incredible. 

I'm a fan of dialogue driven crime dramas and this is one of the best of them. The world, the characters and the tension are all excellent. I had no idea where this movie was going and I didn't care, I was loving the ride. 

Brad Pitt was the obvious standout, he controlled every single scene he was in. But also Scoot McNairy, he really sold the character of the junkie to me. I felt actual empathy for him, despite what he does in the film. The cinematography is also *absolutely* gorgeous. There is a rather amazing slow motion sequence involving a drive by which is amazing.

I had a blast with this movie and I feel if you're a fan of dialogue driven movies like Tarantino, then this will be a great movie for you.

What did you guys think?

**Edit: It looks like I'm not the only one who has loved this movie, do yourself a favour and check it out guys. Lots of people have seemingly made snap judgements about it because of some of the reviews.** 




 I've been consistent with my feelings towards him, irrespective of the internet. I laughed my arse off at his old shit (I still do), but he hasn't made a funny movie I like since Little Nicky. 




 I cannot fucking wait for this movie. BRING US A FULL TRAILER!!! 




 Lots happened, it was a 2 year relationship between us. So it's kinda hard to write everything out.  




 I updated my post with some further information on how we met, what else do you want to know? 




 Haha, mums is at end of may 




 Hes 2 years older than me 




 That works both ways, all my mates in the military **always** make my birthday parties, but those who go away for christmas are **never** at my parties :( 




 Sorry you asked now, aren't you :-)

OP has deliverance'd. 




 Great response! 

His responses usually are

He's definitely /u/funchords at parties. 




 Really solid post with amazing information, I do have a question though:

Do you want to *feed* on someone named Cletus, or are you asking someone named Cletus to *feed* you? 




  I personally don't use it , but now throughout the day I do tend to watch what I'm eating and count the calories for the day in my head just to give me a rough estimate.

I'm not trampling on what you're doing, since I'm doing the exact same thing. But something we both need to be constantly aware of is that when we get really close to our goal weight, we're probably going to have to use some form of proper calorie counting.

Guestimation isn't going to cut it when you need to accurately have a small daily calorie deficit.

However, that's future train_subject5967's problem :P

 




 They have so much love forearms. 




 That's the most common question I get when people find out my birthday is on Christmas eve "do you get two sets of presents?"

Of course I did! :D

The benefit of having a brother who I live with with a birthday 4 days from mine is awesome combined birthday parties that I only have to half organise :D 




 I totally get what you're say, but my biggest ambition is to find me a lady friend :)

I'm 100% sure of that. I broke up with my last girlfriend because I wanted to be single while I was working on my career. I've been working on my career and I've enjoyed being single. I'm ready and willing to settle down :)

I don't want to be romantically lonely for the rest of my life, just like I don't want to be unemployed for the rest of my life. So I guess in that way I'm 'filling a hole'. 




 When it's smoked tuna it removes much of the fishy-ness. Also when it's mixed with the tomatos and spices it accentuates really well. 




 I work as a software developer and I work with a lot of testers and business analysts. I've been working in this career for almost 4 years and the business analysts and testers are almost **always** female. 

So back to your question - I have no experiences what so ever with gender dynamics. Everyone is respectful and friendly. Gender is not something which has ever come up, everyone is there to work and work we do. If we socialise, we do so with great affection.

This is why I struggle so much with some of the SJWs out there, they scream bloody murder and tell these stories about gender injustice, but I just don't see it - ever.

The people I know all treat each other with respect, irrespective of gender, politics, religion or sexual orientation. 




 How's everyone in this thread doing today?

*uncomfortably averts gaze* 




 A girl I was pining over for months offered to pick me up and drive me to work. Along the way, she was acting weird. So we kept driving as we pulled up, she turned to me and said "I broke up with X", I had ran over this scenario in my head over and over and over and I still was not prepared for it.

She was staring at me and I froze up, I wanted to kiss her I wanted to hug her, but I didn't want to take advantage. So my brain shut down, after at least 10 seconds of staring at each other (it felt like hours). She scoffed and threw her face at me in a passionate kiss. 

Turns out she broke up with him because she wanted to be with me.

**Edit:** To add further context and embarrassment - we had met, hooked up (while she and her BF were on a temporary break) and parted ways, she then started dating her ex full time (who has the same first name as me, make of that as you will). We had such a strong connection that she contacted me out of the blue and we started hanging out, strictly platonic, I don't cheat. We talked almost everyday and became best friends very quickly. As the months drew on, her relationship started getting rocky. (No, it wasn't because of me. Their relationship was in trouble before she even met me, thus the temporary break). One night when we were out at a party, a friend (who didn't know about her BF) assumed by the way she was looking at me that she was interested in me, after asking her about her obvious feelings for me she bursted into tears and ran away from the party.

I ended up chasing her down to find out what was wrong, we had a weird little moment where she admitted she loved me and didn't know what to do. I told her I felt the same way, but it's not fair to string her SO along like this. She agreed the event as described above occurred the following week.

**So as you can see, when she said "I broke up with X", that was her basically yelling "I want to be with you". So I did get the hint but I was stuck like a deer in the headlights on how to react to it.**

**Edit 2:** As a follow up, [I wrote a post the other day about how we first met](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/38cv83/would_you_go_home_with_a_girl_you_met_in_a_bar_if/cruotla). We had a 2 year relationship after all of the events above. There is a lot that happened during that time so it would take too long to go over all of it.

**Edit 3:** I've been PM'd a few times to ask what happened after she broke up with her Ex. Ill give an outline. So finally, after months of knowing each other and having the most intimate relationship we've both ever had. We **finally** had sex and it was the most explosive and intense sex I've ever had. It was full of passion and affection. The best way I can describe it as is **pure unrelenting lust**. We both wanted each other in every way available and couldn't have enough. 

Our sex life was like that for much of the 2 years we dated after that. It never reduced in intensity, which was incredible. It wasn't just the sex life, it was the connection we shared. Those who've met someone they can just talk to about anything while never breaking eye contact and never being uncomfortable with silence, know exactly what I'm talking about. But I was an idiot 19 year old and I didn't stop the oncoming train which I created.

She broke it off with me because I was an idiot. I wasn't willing to make changes to my life (for the betterment of myself) that she wanted. I was gaining weight, smoking, drinking too much and I was spending more time fucking around with my mates or playing video games than finishing my studies. This immaturity ended up ruining the relationship with this girl. My first love, she was perfect guys. I'm serious. In 2 years of dating we almost never fought, and if we did then it was always resolved quickly.

It's been 8 years since that day and I still think about her. I still think about her smile, her smell and her voice. Everytime I see a redhead I think for a moment that it may be her and she wants to get back with me. I've not spoken about this for years to anyone, I strangely feel cathartic just spelling it out to you guys. Thanks for that.

 




 The real question is, what order? 

Also FYI, */r/thosearetheheartandsoulofreddit* doesn't exist :( 




 Having the far better situation during a pregnancy : / 




 tl;dr read this thread, that's some sad shit :( 









 Fucking Taken. 




 Yeah, it has better character development. 




 Forced two girls in our class who were wearing satin boxers longer than their school dresses to remove them in front over everyone in the middle of class. For clarification, it was an old lady teacher and it was kinda fucked up now that I think about it. 




 Oh you better believe I did/still do. 




 I know that feeling! I get it on the walk from my office to the train station on a Friday afternoon. Best feeling ever. 




 [Link for the lazy](http://www.reddit.com/r/LadyBoners/comments/17fl4o/one_of_my_friendshes_pretty_adorable/c8540j5?context=3) 




 Don't have kids or pets. 




 Haha, your title is still making me laugh. 

I misread it as:

What was your worst shit**?** that sounded much better in my head' 




 Phone call, or SMS if I'm in a movie. 




 Each sentence you wrote was its own rollercoaster. 




 How typical is this? A close female relative of mine is looking to have a divorce and they have a 2 year old involved. I would hate for her to shut off because of it :( 




 I just posted the recipe in my comment, it is like a casserole, yes. 




 Absolutely, the main culprits for calories are obviously the cheese and the pasta. There is no reason I couldn't also reduce the amount of pasta in the dish and perhaps add something else to it. Diced carrots could work quite well for a filler :) 




 I'm currently 27 and I'm looking to settle down. I'm ready to start a LTR. I have a stable career and nearly have enough to buy a house. I would love to find someone to move out with, I'm done being single.

That being said, I'm not ready to start a family. Not right now anyway. I'm still not sure if I'll ever be ready, it's kind of terrifying actually. What if I'll never want kids? What a the chances of relationships working out if that doesn't change.

I would be totally upfront about that. I could definitely handle some casual dating, but if I find someone worth settling down with, I'm happy to do that forever. 




 So there was a meal which I used to cook quite often before I started my journey. Tuna pasta bake. It was simple and oh my god was it delicious; carb and cheese loaded deliciousness.

I would make a big batch and get 4 meals out of it. After I started losing weight I decided to do some calorie counting for this meal. I was shocked, the entire meal was around 6000 calories, so by splitting it into 4 meals it was around 1500 calories each meal.

No fucking wonder I was going over my daily limit, that is 75% of my daily calorie needs.

I then got a little bit sad because, I realised that I can't eat like I used to. But after some further calculations, if I were to reduce the cheese I added to it and then broke it down into 6 servings instead of 4, then that would limit each serving to 800 calories. I now can budget it into my daily diet, so while it isn't something I will eat everyday - I can keep it frozen for meals down the line.

Just because you're cutting back portions, doesn't mean you cant enjoy the food you love :)

**Edit: I'm bored and hungry, so ill post the recipe ;)**

- Grated cheese, 500g

- Penne pasta, 500g

- Canned tuna in brine, 420g

- Canned diced tomatoes, 800g

- Garlic salt

- pepper

- Need 2 saucepans, one of pasta one for sauce, pasta strainer and baking dish.

*Instructions*

- Preheat oven to 200c and start boiling water for pasta. Heat a pan with oil, then add the canned tomatos and a cup of water.

- Stir for a bit, then add garlic salt and pepper, keep simmering till the mix is thick. Take off the heat after around 5-10 minutes.

- Drain the tuna and place into the sauce and mix well.

- Cook penne pasta in the water, once the pasta is cooked, strain the pasta and mix it in with the sauce.

- Add half of your cheese to the mixture and stir well. 

- Base the casserole dish and place the mixture into it, then cover it evenly with the remaining cheese.

- Place into the oven till the cheese on top fully melts.

**Bingo, you have lift off. A very inexpensive meal which is absolutely delicious**

 




 I miss cheese, but after seeing how calorically rich it is, it's been easy to avoid. 




 Right, here we go. 

So to set the scene, its a 16 year virgin old me. Never had a girlfriend before. I end up meeting this girl through work, we hit it off and end up dating. Over the course of the next 10 months more and more lies start to pile up. I would like to preface this by saying that I was a foolish youngster who had no reason to think someone could be a compulsive liar and I was finally getting laid - so I was able to be in denial about the problems with her. Here we go:

She tells me that she was not a virgin, but had been kidnapped and raped over the course of 2 weeks the previous year by a group of guys. She apparently broke free with the help of a innocent bystander and with help of the doctors afterwards, she was able to have surgery to restore her lady business to "exactly as it was before the ordeal", so she would conveniently appear to be a virgin.

She tells more progressive lies about medical conditions she has. She would have 'seizures', and I was told by her to attend to her when it happens, hold her, comfort her, etc. After this happened a few times, I was growing suspicious since she could apparently retain all of the memory during the seizures which I'm told isn't how they work. So one night, while I was trying to get to sleep she was apparently not getting enough attention, so after checking if I had fallen asleep yet, she started to seize in front of me. I pretended to be asleep while she writhed around on the bed. I could see out of my partially closed eyes as she noticed I was 'asleep', she immediately stopped seizing, looked at me and then shrugged and rolled over. After I brought up her condition to her mother (who said she had no idea about it), the seizures seemed to disappear. Funny that.

She would tell complicated lies about my best friend who was suspicious of her bullshit. One time almost convincing me that he had forcefully grabbed her and tried to force himself on her. This girl really liked to play the rape card. More on that soon. She also started spinning lies about how the attacker who had her kidnapped was back in her life and started threatening my life, she told me of an envelope she apparently received with a picture of me doing yard work. I was so scared.

After finally having enough with her, I broke it off. I had finally caught her in enough lies that I bit the bullet. Immediately after I did that I started getting crying phone calls and text messages. She wouldn't leave me alone. She then lied and told me that she was pregnant and that I needed to leave school, get back together with her and be a father. [I made a post here elaborating on this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/385al8/how_did_you_tell_your_parents_you_were_sexually/crsfyy0) and with the help of my parents I was able to see through her bullshit and after confronting her by making her take a pregnancy test in front me, twice. It confirmed her bullshit once and for all

I started getting more phone calls from other people I've never met before. Turns out she was going around telling station rats that I had been a violent boyfriend who had raped her while my brother video taped the whole thing. After she got pregnant from this, I then pushed her down a flight of stairs because she wouldn't get an abortion. These violent phone calls I would get never amounted to anything luckily, but my brother was accosted by some station rats with baseball bats after work, they ended up smashing in a coworkers car thinking it was my brothers. Completely fucked up situation. After that, the direct attacks on me and my brother started to end. I was finally knowing peace.

Until a few months later when my sister started acting out in the family, she was distant, would sneak out and do all sorts of stuff which wasn't typical of her normal quiet nature. Turns out my cunt of an ex had started manipulating my sister to get back at me. I wont go into detail but my very impressionable sister was getting close with the wrong crowd and after some worrying behaviour I had a sit down with her, who had only ever heard my ex's side of the story. After a long and candid conversation explaining what had happened between us, my sister came to her senses and broke off their relationship.

All this happened almost a decade ago and I guess I've kind of suppressed it. It was a completely fucked situation and I had a **really** hard time trusting women after that. I think it also explains why now days I have a hard time dealing with sympathy diggers.

I've learned my lesson and I've not stuck my dick in crazy since.
 




 FYI, in Australia we stand to the left and walk to the right. This is also true for driving on the road and walking on the sidewalk.

 I appreciate your judgement, as a fatty who's 30 lbs down I wonder what people think when they see me smash out a good cardio session at the gym :) 




 The inability of some people to work in a customer facing job. 

I don't need you to go above and beyond your position, but I expect some damn customer assistance. I worked in retail for 7 years and every single time someone approached me with a query, I would (with a smile) be friendly, helpful and would address their query in a timely manner.

**I was being paid to be the front end of the store**, why the fuck is this lost on so many people?

I constantly will see obviously bored people, who roll their eyes and do the bare minimum to assist me while being mono tonal and somewhat rude. 

I get it, you don't enjoy your job. Go fucking work somewhere where you're not the face of the company then. 




 I am also lazy as duck

Paging /u/fuckswithducks 




 Really good post man, you know what we need?

A wave of scientific consensus towards the effects of actual medical conditions and obesity. I'm so sick (heh) and tired of hearing so many people blame a self diagnosed condition as an excuse for shitty living.

Much like the climate change denying movement, we need a large scale effort in debuking such misinformation. 




 It wasn't the present itself, its the context of the present.

My birthday is the 24th of December and my brothers is on the 28th, we're both very used to getting a combined birthday/christmas present, that's fine.

One particular year my sister bought me a DVD of Hot Fuzz for Christmas, fuck yeah - I love that movie. The conversation went something like this.

"Thanks sister, this is awesome"
"No worries train_subject5967, now that's a shared birthday and christmas present for you and your brother"

That's right, she spent $20~ on a 4 in 1 present for me and my brother. I didn't really care all that much, I'm sure money was tight, I just thought it was a funny piece of ingenuity. 




 What I loved about that was how fucking close it was to the books. There were some slight choreographical changes, but otherwise it stayed true to the book. 




 The Raid and The Raid 2.

Both of those movies had the most incredible and dynamic fight scenes I've ever seen. 




 You and me both. It seems most of the criticisms isn't due to the entertainment value of the movie, its around some ancillary thing . Over the top cameos for example. 




 Letting myself go at the age of 21. I had broken up with a wonderful woman and instead of working to make myself better, I kept letting laziness take over. I'm 27 now and I'm now working to undo all of those years of abuse towards my own body.

My regret is that I feel that I've wasted the majority of my 20s in a sorry state. 




 Ser Arthur Dayne. 




 I read somewhere that excessive body fat acts like estrogen, thus males getting more "femaley"

Hold on, I remember reading something about this. That's why obese men develop that gynomastia (or how ever you spell it). Now that makes more sense.

I'm in the same boat about the facial hair man, im 27 and I still cant grow it well for the upper cheeks and that area in the middle of your moustache (I call it the reverse Hitler.) 




 "meat **lover** pizza"

Yeah, without the pluralisation, it's still oddly sexual. 




 Everytime you post, your links stay blue for me. It's not that I'm disgusted, I'm actually rather impressed.

It's just that I'm worried something will get triggered. 




 Yeh, nah she'll be roight.

Don't mind me, just setting the scene. 




 "Your kid sure is cute"

Oh god what an ugly baby : / 




 Rather than posting everything, I'm just going to post what happened this time last year.

June 5th 2014 I got a job offer after 2 months of unemployment. I'm still at that job now :)

Yay

 




 "Hi, I'm train_subject5967, what's your name?"

Works a treat 




  Yeah, it was a strange couple of years.

:|

 




 It wouldn't make a difference and I would question the people who think otherwise. Of course this depends on the skill that you're talking about.

I couldn't care any less if a girl doesnt have my computer programming skills, but if she has no ability to handle her own finances that may be a problem, unless she is willing to learn. 




 /thread 




 It's going to be hard, but it needs to be said. Many years ago my first serious GF had to have that conversation with me. It sucked but knowing where you stand will help if he wants to make the change.

He may think that you're indifferent to his eating habits, thus why he does what he does. 




 My ex told me that mine tastes better when I transfer her a weekly shopping allowance. I'm starting to think this whole thing was a ruse. 




 Ask leading questions to find interests. Quick example - *What do you do for a living?* - if they're a student, you can go from there and ask them what they're studying, where they're studying, what is their plan after studying, etc. If you have personal anecdote about something they've said, share it! Keep the conversation going. Ask questions and be genuine.

They just mentioned that they're studying something you've never heard of? Ask them to give you a brief run down. If they're working full time instead of studying, then ask them about their job in a similar manner as above. You'd be surprised how many stories and questions you can come up with from just about any topic. 

 




 I'm figuring it's something like that, there are some seriously strange and unexpected side effects of weight loss out there. 




 Instructions completely clear - dick stuck in fan 




 Depends on the girl.

Let me explain.

While away on a holiday with my school friends, we were organising a party at our place that night. We bumped into a group of girls during the day. So being the super confident dudes that we were, several of us approached them and struck up a conversation. We ended up inviting them to the party that night (god I miss confident 18 year old train_subject5967). So anyway, they said yes.

In this group, there was a stand out girl. Smart, pretty and extremely funny. My friend and I on the drive back both called dibs on her. He ended up backing down as long as "I could close the deal in 20 minutes". Pretty tall order.

Anyway, the girls turned up and me and this girl hit it off. One thing led to another and we disappeared into a bedroom. There we were, both in a locked room. She told me straight away "Long story short, I'm not sleeping with you tonight. Nothing personal, it's just my rule". I decided to go with it instead of bailing.

It was one of the best decisions of my young adult life. We ended up spending most of the night lying in bed, making out, laughing and talking. It was like a fucking movie. We had the best time.

After spending the night in each others arms, I was totally smitten. Over the next week we spent nearly every night drinking, talking and hooking up. Still no nookie though. That was **totally** fine, those who have had a true connection with someone know what I'm talking about.

I'm happy to tell the whole story if you guys want, but suffice to say that if I had bailed on her the second she declined sex, I would've missed out on my very first love. 




 I almost thought about tagging this as a NSV, but I noticed in the shower today that my underarm hair has gotten thicker... I'm a fair haired guy and over the years of obesity I noticed my underarm hair was getting thinner. Now it seems to have started to grow back. 

Is this a normal part of weight loss? I'm happy I guess, it used to look like I shaved my armpits. 




 So 3 months ago, I'd had enough. So I decided to make a real effort to change. So far, so-fucking-good.

I'm currently losing around 2 lbs a week consistently, so my main goal will to be keeping that weekly loss going for the next 12 weeks. Which means I'll be able to get past 50 lbs lost well before the 12 weeks are up.

In late August I have a planned camping trip (proper camping, none of this porcelain toilet nonsense) and I would love to be in crazy good shape for that trip. In previous years I've struggled with some of the physical needs of the trip. Not this time.

At the moment I'm doing 2-3 gym sessions per week. They consist of 45~ minutes on the tread mill:

- 5 minute warm up

- 10 minute fast walking

- 5 minute jog

- 10 minute fast walking

- 5 minute jog

- 5 minute fast walking

- 5 minute cool down

My end plan is to gradually reduce this watered down cardio session to a full jogging session. I'll be periodically increases those jogging intervals as time passes.
 




 Don't be such a negatron. 




 That's a perfectly fine thing to think about, but I think you're missing the big picture here...

You've already proven how strong willed you are! To lose 50 lbs is an insane achievement! If you stuck with the initial change of diet, you're totally ready to adjust it further to meet your goal. 

I'm currently eating a 2000 diet, but I know once I get to your level of loss, I'll need to readjust my diet just like you need to. I'm ready for it! Show that will power :) 




 I know the fear you're speaking of, I have around 100lbs to lose and I'm worried how my stomach will look. I've taken solace in the number of photos I've seen where people have had minimal loose skin with that kind of weight loss. It **does** happen.

I'm the same with you though, it's not going stop me from doing what I'm doing. 




 I've not seen it yet (doing so tomorrow), but this the the one thing I care about. It can suck, it can be boring, but it better not try to reinvent the wheel. The movie could be made with minimal reference to the show, but the main aspects of the show need to be in the movie. Brotherhood, growing up and defining yourself.

It's currently 32% on rotten tomatoes, but from what I read, those who're fans of the show enjoyed it. 




 That's not the realisation I meant, I mean show her *exactly* how much each piece of food is. She might think a salad is low cal, when it's not in her case.

FTFY
 




 Toyota. I've only ever owned Toyotas and while my friends all have persistent car troubles, mine have never needed more than the standard wear and tear services. Not only that, the parts and very cheap. 




 (Spoilers All) The white walkers can't swim


I'm not saying the white walkers can swim.

I get what you mean, but this is still funny as hell 




 Hello fellow Australian :)

Nice work, it's never easy to give up old habits. I've been off the beers for almost 3 months now and I can tell you... It's been kind of awesome. I'm saving a ton of money, I'm having better sleep and socialising at parties is actually easier.

While I do miss the shit out of a nice cold one with dinner, I have lots of metaphorical debt to pay off before I can do that again.

 




 The proverbial proof is in the proverbial pudding, isn't it?

Shit loads of people from this subreddit have lost tons of weight without any exercise. I had a 3 week break earlier last month from exercise and my rate of loss was pretty much the same.

Exercise is still extremely important, but I'd rather see a skinny out of shape person over an obese out of shape person. So if exercise is a deal breaker, telling someone to focus on their diet is perfectly fine. As long as you preface that advice with a mention of how important exercise is *as well*. 




 Next time get diet cocaine fries.

Nice one :D 




 I think the you underestimate the number of underrated under-appreciation threads. 




 Seriously? That's a rather stupid thing to let lose. If they do plan 'for the watch' to occur, why reveal something like this? 




 Wait a minute, this didnt happen in this weeks episode, why are we discussing this OP? /s 




 Wouldn't it be funny if they *did* include the rattleshirt/mance bait and switch from books and Tormund just beat Mance Rayder to death haha 




 You really dodged a bullet there 




 When ever she repackages askreddit threads with a slightly different question. 




 Paper? Like from the toilet? 




  misinformation (or lack of information)

While both of these are the problem, I'm sad to say that there is probably more *misinformation*. Which makes me fucking sad. 

Think about it, somewhere an overweight person is spending their small amount of spare money on a pill they saw which guaranteed them something for nothing. Or there is someone who has a disease which stops them from being overly active, but because they were always told "you need to exercise to lose weight", they've given up hope and eat their sorrows.

I'm in the same boat as you, I really enjoy the 2-3 gym sessions I do each week. It really is a mental and physical boost. It falls back on the common saying in /r/loseit.

**Weight loss = 80% diet + 20% exercise**
 




 June 3rd, 2015 - the day Reddit stood chill. 




 **Cunty McFucksticks**

Hey, that *is* fun :) 




 Whiskey in a Jar by Metallica, that shit is incredible. 




 PUT THE RABBIT DOWN, SIR 




 The problem is the misinformation out there. If society tells you that you can't lose weight without exercise (obviously nonsense) and you can't exercise, then you can't lose weight in your own eyes. The amount of people out there who're not willing to try because 'exercise is hard' is staggering.

Hell, I was one of those people not that long ago. We all hold onto our ignorance and don't really like to hear a contrary truth. Especially when we've been telling ourselves these 'truths' for many years.

So while you may feel it trivialises your efforts (and it does), you have to see it from the perspective of the uninformed. 




 In the vast majority of cases fat people are fat because they eat too much, not because of genetics. 




 Had to read your post a few times to get it haha

That's actually an awesome idea to help conceptualise your efforts! Now what weights 30 lbs that I can strap to my body... 




 I don't suppose you have it? For posterity?
