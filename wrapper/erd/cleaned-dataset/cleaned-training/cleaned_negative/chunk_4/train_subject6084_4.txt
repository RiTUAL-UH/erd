**Cetaceans, sex and sea serpents**

In 1741 the missionary Hans Egede published the report of a "terrible monster" seen at sea near the coast of Greenland. Accompanied by an illustration of himself which you can see below, would become a particularly famous story in the collection of stories about "sea snakes".

Over the centuries, various explanations have been suggested to the event, like the sailors might have seen a giant squid (Architeuthis) with a raised tentacles confused with a tail.
But Charles Paxton, University of Saint Andrews in England recently suggested a more interesting hypothesis. Paxton has received the Ig Nobel biology prize in 2002 for his study on the procession of excited to British farmers ostriches, so it's not so surprising that one of the ideas outlined by scientist to explain the story of Egede is that sailors have seen a whale penis.

Yes, a male whale of a species unknown to mariners, excited for some reason and taking his erect member - which can reach almost two meters long - confused by the tail of a sea serpent .One image, however, may be worth more than the past thirty-five words:

The suggestion is serious, and is contained in a paper published in the journal Archives of Natural History, "Cetaceans, fri   sea serpents: an analysis of the Egede accounts of a Most Dreadful Monster seen off the coast of Greenland in 1734".
At work, Paxton together with Erik Knatterud and Sharon Hedley, discusses thoughtfully:

*We do not have "absolute confidence" in our interpretation of the creature Egede. Nor are we suggesting that whale cocks are a universal source of marine sightings of snakes, although we believe that another sighting, the merchant ship Pauline in 1875 when a sea serpent as a White pillar? of views between various sperm? frantic with excitement? (Heuvelmans 1968; Oudemans, 1892), could be a mistake of this nature (penis sperm whales can be white (Harrison, 1938)) .In the case of Egedes, we assume that the use of facsimile snake and drawings were not completely accurate. If they were accurate, then the strongest objection to the interpretation of whale sighting Egede is evident the presence of teeth in the drawing.*

*Our explanation also assumes that the witnesses would not have recognized the penis of a whale and that some species exhibit their penises in the summer of Greenland. Hans Egede (1741 ,1745) described the great Manhood a whale but Egedes may not have realized that he could be seen at sea.*

*Despite these objections, even if the monster was an unknown species, characteristics suggest a cetacean diagnosed. In the end, we will never know for sure. Whatever Poul Egede had seen that day, be a loving whale, a whale without a tail or an unknown species, was a very unusual sight both then and today.*

Which brings us to another fascinating image comparing frightening medieval illustrations with casual pictures whales wildly excited. The first image of a whale penis in this note comes from this site, and second, this. You can also watch the video of a terrifying encounter with sea serpents fighting with whales, whales mating confused with this link .

 It turns out that they were aware that this kind of format could skew the results in the [original study](http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/69/4/603.html), so they removed those type of sports where there are gold medal/bronze medal matches from the analysis and still got similar results. 




 And I guess the third place finisher can be full of "what if"s too, but in the opposite direction. i.e. "What if I hadn't done that turn so well, and missed out on the bronze!". Hence, feeling better in the situation than the silver medalist.

 There are 69 story missions in GTA5. Here is a useful guide to them all:

http://gta.wikia.com/Missions_in_GTA_V

As we know, the order of most of these is optional. You can choose Michael, Trevor or Franklin (or sometimes a combination of the three) before each is begun. Of course, some can only be completed in order, such as the prologue and the ones involving Franklin at the beginning of the story. 

Let's make a very conservative estimate that only 30 of these missions are of the type that can be started in an optional order, and that there is a choice of only 2 before each. Then, there are

2 to the power 30 = 1073741824  **1 billion** ways to complete GTA5, depending on the order of missions.

What if the big easter eggs we would all like to see required someone to complete the story with one specific order of missions? Wouldn't that be the kind of elaborate puzzle that rewarded true fans, which Rockstar is likely to set up?

The chance of someone already finishing the game in the correct order yet is miniscule, and Rockstar needs to leave an elaborate clue about the order required. What in the game looks like it could provide those clues? **The Chiliad Mural**.

This post is an extension of the ideas started in this thread started by /u/Notaredditr from a few days ago:

http://www.reddit.com/r/chiliadmystery/comments/1wny24/my_mural_theorya_hunter_never_really_stops/

Basically, the lines and glyphs in the mural are a represntation of the GTA5 main story. the ufo is Michael, the egg is Franklin and the jetpack is Trevor. Thankfully the mural is to the right of this post, so you can follow along. Now, here are the key pieces of evidence that this whacky theory may be true and why I believe it should be investigated further:

* the line joining the ufo and the jetpack is the Prologue, because it is at the bottom of the mural and only Michale and Trevor are involved in it. As the story progresses, we go up the mural.

* After the Prologue, we start with Franklin (the egg). He goes up the first middle line, turns left, and eventually meets Michael (the ufo). Then they both come to the first heist, the Jewel Store Job, the first red X. Only those two are involved with that.

* The other red Xs are other heists. I come to the final heist in a bit.

* There are 4 lines which seem to leave the main set of lines, two of which even leave the "mountain" on the mural. These could represent the trip to North Yankton and Did Someone say Yoga, where Michael literally leaves the story, for a while.

* There are 6 heists in GTA5 but only 5 red Xs. The final heist is the eye at the top of the mural, representing the end of the story. What about the 5 lines on top of the eye and the two below? Well, after the final heist you can either kill Michael or Trevor. Those are the two lines below. In the Third Way, the five lines represent the first fight plus the 4 people you have to assassinate in that mission.

How does this relate to completing the missions in a specific order? I believe a good place to start thinking about this is to "travel" along the lines in the mural *which cover the shortest possible distance*. Beyond that, I believe someone with more familiarity with the "mission tree" of GTA5 might be able to identify more parts of the mural's lines, in order to confirm or debunk this theory.

 Ah you do indeed. My bad. 




 I should point out that under this theory, the line underneath connecting M/ufo and T/jetpack would certainly represent the prologue, since these two are involved in that. 




 Right, is it possible to complete the main storyline by "traversing" the lines in the mural with this idea of M/UFO, F/Egg and T/jetpack in a way that makes any sense? Perhaps by covering the shortest possible distance? This doesn't preclude some big payoff at the end. After all, it's "not how you won or lost, but how you played the game". 




 OK I'll bite. Could the Xs represent the heists? The first heist, Jewel Store Job, involves only Michael (UFO) and Franklin (Egg), it would be the X on the lower left, most connected to the UFO and Egg. The second last heist (Bureau Raid) also only involves these two, it would be the X on the upper left. The other three heists (Merryweather, Blitz Play and Paleto Score) involve all three characters, and could be the three Xs on the right. The final heist (Big Score) could be represented by the eye at the top, which represents the end of the story. "Come back when your story is complete". The lines in between these could represent the paths of the characters in between the heists, i.e. the intervening missions. Therefore the mural could be a graphical representation of the story. 




 Most trusted **and** least trusted, according to that poll.
