 Could you perhaps try

     String.format("%02d:%02d:%02d", hour, minutes, seconds); 




 I would consider using python! Python is a scripting language and is pretty easy to pick up and learn and you can do a lot with it - that's why it is used as an intro language for lots of CS courses. 

There are also a lot of modules you can use to help you create nice things such as PyGame etc. I would definitely consider giving it a look.
