 early next year for sure, dodger stadium is certainly one I'm looking forward to seeing, cheers 




 honestly, more about being there than the beer itself, haven't had a bad beer yet (although miller comes verrrry close). I teach university so I have the time and my wife is onboard with the idea though she rarely travels with me 




 yep, that's how they roll
