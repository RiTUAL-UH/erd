 Yes! I am really starting to get the feeling that I might get more out of the experience if I wait.Thank you for the advice! 




 Thank you! I was just feeling worried that if I did not start now, that I might be one of those teachers, 30 years in the future, who wishes that they got their masters.
It's awesome to hear that your experience may have been better after waiting. 




 Thank you. These are some awesome questions that I will definitely ask myself. 
Truthfully, I miss being a student, I would love a pay raise and I feel like if I don't go back soon, I won't go back at all.
