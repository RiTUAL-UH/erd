 Kolin looks like Samus Aran in terms of the hairstyle. 




 Apparently from the Capcom Pro Talk, it was announced they are both commentating Ultra on the srkevo1 stream. Disappointing since I preferred Seth Killian or/and Zhi.  




 Great for humanity. 




 Air won't beat Gamerbee in his bracket. 




 Xiao Hai is a dangerous darkhorse. Won't be surprised if he won it. The KOF god is hungry for SF glory. 




 Yeah I think so too. Isn't gambling illegal anyway in the Las Vegas hall where the Evo venue is at? 




 If he sticked to Chun throughout the whole SF4 iteration then I doubt he would make as big as an impact like in 3S.  




 Daigo got 5th place in Evo 2012. So it would actually be:

1, 1, 4, 5, 7, 48 




 Apparently there's gonna be a special exhibition between these two at this upcoming Evo on Madcatz's stream. I saw it on MarkMan's twitter but I can't find it. If he deleted it, then I'm gonna assume it's not happening.
