 Boehner's office said the visit aimed to send "a strong, unequivocal message that the House of Representatives wants to maintain a right-sized presence in Afghanistan." 




 Starting in 1964  the same year he signed the Civil Rights Act  U.S. forces and their allies flew more than 580,000 bombing missions across Vietnams neighbor to the west, targeting nearly every corner of the country. The bombs stopped falling in 1973.

 Please watch this video.

* Carter calls Osama bin Laden, et. al "freedom fighters" and admits he was responsible for giving them weapons.

  "I was hoping the United States would say, 'Let's sit down and talk and solve these problems,' but America was going on and doing what I expected them to do." 




 "Russia is a gas station masquerading as a country, McCain said. Its kleptocracy, its corruption. Its a nation thats really only dependent upon oil and gas for their economy. And so economic sanctions are important. Get some military assistance to Ukrainians, at least so they can defend themselves. Resume the missile defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic. Look at Moldova and Georgia, both of whom are occupied by Russian troops as we speak, a path toward membership in NATO. 




 Declare that any further Russian military incursion beyond Crimea will lead to a rapid and favorable response from NATO to any request from Kiev for weapons. These would be accompanied by significant numbers of NATO trainers and advisers. 




 I think this is actually an important event.  A conservative Texas Republican governor thinking it's politically prudent to take a more moderate stand on pot legalization.  This never would have happened 5 years ago.

 People my age have grown up with a decade of war and were tired of it, Mezzina said. When people like Sen. Marco Rubio push for more war, more bombing and sending troops overseas, its not something that appeals to my generation.

 Late post, but thought this story was worth a read. 




 So who did they kill? 




 How many countries are stamped on your passport?

Quite a few.  I've always found that people are pretty much the same around the world.  You see dark-skinned head-chopping religious fanatics around every corner.  You've been brainwashed by the U.S. military, I haven't been.

 I wonder if the U.S. will also condemn [this attack](http://news.antiwar.com/2014/01/17/probe-wednesday-us-air-strikes-killed-14-afghan-civilians/)? 




 The NYT article makes depressingly, horrifyingly clear that we remain very, very far from becoming adults, if by "adult" we mean recognizing certain unalterable facts of our existence. Our politicians, our military personnel, and many Americans still refuse to face honestly and completely the reality of what the U.S. did in Iraq, just as they refuse to recognize the blood-drenched reality of U.S. foreign policy in general. It is inconceivable that any of the catastrophic consequences of our actions, including the suffering of U.S. military personnel, should be our own responsibility. We therefore blame anything and anyone else, including the victims of our own crimes.

 And it falls upon Muslims themselves to take on their violent brothers.

Has Rand taken on his Christian "violent brothers?" 




 Today's war is perpetrated by **"a fanatical element of Islam,"** Rand said, adding that most Muslims are not commited to violence against Christians. However, those who are number in the tens of millions, he said. And it falls upon Muslims themselves to take on their violent brothers. 




 But the United States wants to keep using Special Operations forces to target the **roughly 75 operatives** that American commanders estimate remain in Afghanistan.

 He described Al Qaeda, the reason the United States came to Afghanistan, as a shell of its former self, with **only about 75 members** in Afghanistan, and most of them too busy trying to stay alive to plan attacks in the West. 




 We left (Iraq) on the edge of being stable, Lt. Col. Anthony Shaffer, a former military intelligence officer, told Fox News. 

While saying it's clear the job was "not done," he warned: Al Qaeda as an entity is coming back strong within the region and is doing things to destabilize governments, which, at this point in time, are still friendly to us." 




 "What it makes me feel is deeper guilt," said Mike Prysner, an anti-war activist who, at 19, was part of the 2003 Army invasion. He served in Iraq for 12 months and left the service as a corporal. 

"One of our roles was to shred their national identity. What is happening today is a direct result of the U.S. occupation's strategy," added Prysner, 30. "I remember the Iraqi government being setup along ethnic lines by the U.S. occupation. I remember arming certain ethnic groups to fight others. I'll live the rest of my life knowing I was a part of that."  




 But he wouldn't fight as hard if he knew the weapons would be used against Muslims or Hindus?

 We know that something like 40 to 50 percent of Americans dont vote. **Ron Paul created his vote. His people were not previously Republicans. They were disaffected, anti-government activists who hated the political process.** He drew them from those Americans who dont vote, and a lot of them are going to go back to not voting. 




 In northern Afghanistan, the State Department last year abandoned plans to occupy a large building it had intended to use as a consulate. After spending more than $80 million and signing a 10-year lease, officials determined the facility was too vulnerable to attacks. 




 [From the NYT](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/03/science/civil-war-toll-up-by-20-percent-in-new-estimate.html?pagewanted=all _r=0): By combing through newly digitized census data from the 19th century, J.

 Yes, because [socialism and militarism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism) are always diametrically opposed and can never be part of the same philosophy. 




 Barack Obama is president now.  You may want to thank him as well. 




 That George W. Bush, who is known to have authorized torture and numerous other crimes against humanity, is being given an award for improving the human condition is a sick, cruel joke, she wrote. 




 The $310 million project, which faced considerable opposition from Italians against militarism, will house elements of the 173rd, the 509th Signal Battalion and eventually U.S. Army Africa. A few dozen protesters still opposed to the project gathered several blocks away. 




 Maybe.  But he's sure as hell more deserving of the award than Barack Obama. 




 It appears to undermine the claim made by President Obama in a May speech that "conventional airpower or missiles are far less precise than drones, and likely to cause more civilian casualties and local outrage". 




 It is no worse than what other countries have done in the past/are doing now.

For the last 50 to 60 years, the US govt is by far the [most violent and deadly force on the planet earth](http://www.alternet.org/investigations/executive-branch-evil-and-lawless).  Your statement is simply incorrect. 




 Maybe he can't get past the mountains of corpses the US govt is responsible for throughout Africa and the rest of the world. 




 Like President Barack Obama, Bush deflected criticism of the spy program.

"I put the program in place to protect the country, and one of the certainties is civil liberties were guaranteed," Bush said in the interview. 




  Some folks mightve looked at Ron Paul and dismiss him out of hand because he was far too extreme to them. Theyll not be able to do the same thing with Rand after they meet him. If you sit and talk to Rand, he comes across as extremely bright, extremely articulate and the farthest thing from crazy or extreme. 




 I'm assuming you're talking to the WashTimes headline writer, not me.  The headline above is directly from their website. 




 Note how the WaPost leaves out the second part of the quote in their headline. 




 It is a matter of indisputable fact that the U.S. Executive Branch has over the past 50 years been responsible for bombing, shooting, burning alive with napalm, blowing up with cluster bombs, burying alive with 500-pound bombs, leveling homes and villages, torturing, assassinating and incarcerating without evidence more innocent civilians in more nations over a longer period of time than any other government on earth today. 




 We're supposed to worship these military guys, right?

 Great comment.  Thanks. 




 Nice try, but that makes absolutely no sense. 




 I never said that the US is "worse than Nazi Germany," so please don't put words in my mouth.

You still have never explained how Germany, located across the Atlantic Ocean and then some, posed a threat to your beloved Homeland.

Stopping genocide was never a war aim of the US govt.  You're smart enough to know that. 




 You're actually wishing that the Axis had conquered Eastern Europe 

Actually, if the USA had never entered the ETO, it is less likely Stalin would have "conquered Eastern Europe."  Hitler then could have concentrated more forces on the eastern front thereby preventing Stalin from advancing to Berlin.  Over time, the Russians would have pushed the Germans out of the USSR but probably wouldn't have had the political or military will to set up the Communist eastern bloc buffer zone that eventually rec'd the Allies' tepid blessing.

the wholesale extermination of Eastern Europe

If you're talking about the extermination of the Jews and other minorities, please remember that the USA did not go to war with Germany to stop what became the Holocaust.  In fact, [FDR was turning away ships with Jewish refugees as late as May of 1939](http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005267).  Here's one passage from the article:

"Sailing so close to Florida that they could see the lights of Miami, some passengers on the St. Louis cabled President Franklin D. Roosevelt asking for refuge. **Roosevelt never responded**."

So perhaps the "miserable racist fuck" you're thinking of is one of America's most beloved presidents.

put a bullet in your head, you fascist fuck

In fact, as a libertarian anarchist I'm the exact opposite of a fascist.  My guess is that your views are much closer to those of the Nazi party.  You probably support torture, endless war against Muslims and other suspect non-white peoples, rendition, domestic spying and the collaboration between govt and corporations in advancing the interests of the state.  I seriously doubt that you have ever advanced the notion that American society would be much better off if it embraced the principles of liberty. 




  Even granting your premise that we weren't threatened by Germany (which I don't)

How again was "The Homeland" threatened by the German military?

I still find your view repulsive

I support peace.  You blindly support war, the most evil enterprise ever created by man.  Whose views are truly repulsive?

a country directly responsible for mass murder and aggression

Then you should engage in war against America.  Because what country on the planet is more responsible for "mass murder and aggression" then your beloved Homeland? 




 Germany posed no threat whatsoever to invade the USA.  They couldn't even conquer England from bases in France.  The US govt should have simply ignored Germany's declaration of war.  If they had, millions of lives would have been saved and Eastern Europe probably wouldn't have suffered thru 45 years of Communist oppression. 




 It is irrelevant whether Germany declared war on the USA, they never posed any threat to the "homeland" and therefore America should never have been involved in the European war. 




 Yes, I did.

If you feel so strongly about your views, then sign up with the U.S. military and go kill Muslims in foreign countries.  Or, perhaps you can become a drone pilot and kill Muslims from Nevada.

 




 You may want to ask yourself *why* someone would want to attack your "homeland."  Perhaps your govt was bombing that person's country for decades killing hundreds of thousands of innocent people.  Maybe your govt had initiated sanctions that had caused untold misery among the population.  Maybe your govt had bankrolled and supported the oppressive dictatorial regime that had terrorized the citizens of his country for decades.

Of course I'm assuming you are talking about the 9/11 attacks since the Germans did not initiate an unprovoked attack against the United States in either WW1 or WW2. 




 Jesus, man, you are one sick and immoral person. 




 Because there's never a better way to solve problems than killing millions of innocent people. 




 Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying. 




 Yes, I am telling you that the neither the Zimmerman Telegram nor the Lusitania incident justified U.S. involvement in WW1.  Of course, the Germans weren't involved in the Pearl Harbor bombing so that attack did not justify the U.S. entering the European war in WW2.

the two worst wars that the world has ever seen

They were both made worse by U.S. involvement. 




 You need to read more history.  Both of those wars were b.s.  In any event, America never should have been involved.  Germany never threatened the "homeland" and therefore all of those soldiers died for absolutely nothing. 




 Yeah, like when?  Give me a couple of examples. 




 Then why continue the wars, drone attacks and killing? 




 Small children are burned alive in cars. Worshippers are cut down outside their own mosques. This is beyond unacceptable, he said on May 17; Systemic violence is ready to explode at any moment." 




 I expect him not to go on a trip that costs "tens of millions" when the benefit to the United States is zilch. 




 Nothing like a new war to distract from scandal.

Yeah, I'm sure that would have done a lot of good.

 In the end it is not Bradley Manning who is on trial. His trial ended long ago. The defendant now, and for the next 12 weeks, is the United States. A runaway military, whose misdeeds have been laid bare, and a secretive government at war with the public. They sit in the docks. We are called to serve as jurists. We must not turn away. 




 David Coombs, Mannings civilian defense lawyer, opened by describing an incident in Iraq on December 24, 2009. A US military convoy, traveling along a roadway, forced a vehicle carrying five civilians onto the side of the road. They struck a roadside bomb.

At Forward Operating Base Hammer, where Manning was stationed, he and other intelligence officers watched the event unfold. The other soldiers erupted in cheers because the US forces were unhurt, Coombs said. Manning was disturbed.

Send them home, where life goes on and no one really understands the profound change in their life and perceptions.
Let them deal with the VA bureaucracy that is consistantly overwhelmed and underfinanced. Have the VA delay or deny their rightful claim to disability.
Have republican members of Congress vote against a Veterans Employment Bill.
