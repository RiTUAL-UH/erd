 I've seen it several times. Still uncertain about the physics of it. 




 The Tesla machine that Angier uses for his ultimate trick creates a duplicate of Angier. One remains in place at the machine and another several feet away. My question is if the "real" Angier is at the base of the machine isn't that certain death in regards to the glass tank beneath him? This is assuming that the original Angier is at the base of the machine. If it isn't then the original Angier dies during the first usr of the machine back in Tesla's house. So what was it?  


=calibrating the machine to Copy Angier the base of the machine and teleport the real Angier to a different spot.

=or Angier is fine with dying over and over to best borden


=Or maybe another possibility I haven't thought of.

 Wow, I never knew this. It makes sense. It still doesn't explain the flying car, that was jumping the shark. They established the rules of the world then wrote to contradict that.

 I have watched it again. I find that watching movies with a twist have tend to be enjoyable as you see how it builds up the twist. That is, if it's well done. Also it's fun to show someone a movie with a twist and see their reaction, but that's just me. 




 Operation Paperclip 




 I'm sorry, Mr. Williams. You've created countless smiles and that's just on my face. 









 Well, technically Mr. Universe was a better pilot than Wash only because he hacked his grades. So the Alliance would prefer to clone him. 




 It is but I like his style. 




 I like preparedness, you sir are a survivor.  




 For science... 




 Get off your ass and follow your dreams. 




 I think cloning a new wash would be more expensive than looking for a new pilot. Besides if they could they would've already done it in the comics. That being said it would be a neat concept to have clone wash have an existential crisis about being a clone. 




 Yeah, it's been accepted that Wash's death is the most brutal and emotional in the Whedonverse. It really hurt and was done ultimately because Serenity was a last hurrah for Firefly(as was River's rushed character development). However, if we were to get Firefly back, we would want Book and Wash back, even if it meant in a parallel universe. 




 Mal lived...do you mean Wash? Look I used the show, movie and comics to create season two. In the end I sent them to an alternate universe where everyone could come back.  




 I expected this insight, I know it's kind of a cheat but Firefly itself was cheated and fans would look over this if it meant Wash and Book could come back. It's the writing equivalent of saying,'we're starting over because we didn't get a fair shot the first time.' And quite frankly it seems less sci-fi that we Unkill wash than Firefly coming back (please Netflix).

Joss has said that when he is done with Marvel and Nathan is done with Castle he might revisit the 'verse.


I don't think it's so outlandish to accept a universe tear, even in today's world we are experimenting with particles that could erase everything. I will concede that it's a bit of a coincidence that wash be near the crash site.  




 *blows air, spitting* 




 I tried to do this myself and failed. 




 Also I used current canon planets.   




 At the beginning Shepherd book and Wash are still dead but I created a rift in the universe with the cosmic cloud (think fantastic 4) that threw them into an adjacent universe.  




 I tried to make some characters from season 1 come back (Jubal and Bager) but not so much to stretch them thin. 




 Great ok, here we go.

There's obviously alot I'm leaving out, the plot summaries are basically what you would read off of imdb when clicking on the episode. The ending are the end scene/s. 




 I spent the better part of this afternoon creating plot summaries for 14 episodes of Firefly for a second season. 

I read an Adam Baldwin interview where he said he'd love to return to Firefly but he would want Wash to be unkilled....so I tried to achieve that.

Interested?

 Batman's footage is very interesting. He leaps from rooftop to rooftop, when decending upon the criminals of Gotham you can see him systematically pick them off and beat them to a pulp.


However, Tony Starks footage is just more fun to watch, he zooms through the battles and shoots at folks while cracking smart ass comments.


In this respect, the thing to remember is that Batman probably suffers from a mental disorder since he habitually goes out to fight crime and takes no pleasure in doing it. Tony Stark can notice the danger in what he does but will make it fun to watch all the same. 




 Only think that comes to mind is Smokin' Aces.
