 The abandoned playground ship was found in a abandoned zoo.  




 Thanks for your answer! 
Shooting from a lower point was unfortunately not possible, because I was not able to get into the ship (I'm to tall for playgrounds I think :D). I shooted from a window like the one you can see on the opposite so I was not even able to get the support column out of the way
