 I'm a rising Junior in high school and am taking all my classes at a local community college next year. Part of the process for me was taking the CLEP college algebra exam because I took Calc 1 last year and want to go to Calc 2. It's scaled from 20-80 points. I winded up getting 75 and a couple hours later I got an email from Quest Bridge about them. Coincidence? Is this because of that score? Is that program even something too look into. I am in need of financial help for college and many of the schools I'm looking at are on their partner list. 
TLDR; Is Quest Bridge legit? 




 I understand completely. It's like you could be talking with a group of 30 people and yet you still feel alone because nobody is on the same "wavelength" as you. 




 Thanks, this is what I needed to hear. 




 I've been relatively recently diagnosed and I feel like there is now this thing inside of me that is controlling everything about me. There were things about me that I used to like and now I just think I'm only that way because of my condition and it's not really me. Anyone else feel this way, if so how do you cope with this? 




 I'll be dual enrolling next year and the following year (my junior/senior year) and am going to take classes in C and C++. When I graduate I will be 18, is it possible to get in internship in CS the summer after my senior year?
