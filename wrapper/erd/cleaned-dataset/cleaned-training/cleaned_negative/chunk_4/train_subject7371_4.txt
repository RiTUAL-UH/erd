 First thing I would recommend is to change your perspective. Stop beating yourself up, and start being your biggest supporter. It is incredibly important and it's ridiculous how big a difference that can make in your own success. 
The second thing is to decide what you want to do. It doesn't matter if it seems impossible right now, just pick a direction and go. I've noticed that I'm less distractible when I have a goal to focus on, and even if I get distracted I know which direction to realign with.  You don't need an exact plan, just know where you want to go. The path will form itself.
Keep in mind that things will not change over night. It will take hard work and patience (A LOT of patience), but it is very doable. ADD does not make us dysfunctional, it makes us function differently. 
You can do this.
