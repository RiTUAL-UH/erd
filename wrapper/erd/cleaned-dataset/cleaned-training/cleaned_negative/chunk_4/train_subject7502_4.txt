 Today, I lost my virginity. My boyfriend and I had attempted to have sex before but it had hurt too much to continue, so we had planned to wait a few more months. Naturally, I was preparing myself to handle what I thought would hurt like a bitch. Cut to romantic date night leading up to what was supposed to be a magical moment. I was terrified and positive it would be a bloody, painful mess. But for some reason, I guess due to the foreplay/lube, when he put it in, it barely hurt. And I, reveling in the lack of pain, exclaimed, "Is that it?!". I asked my poor boyfriend, "Is that it?" as he took my virginity.

Disclaimer: He has a big dick.  




 No phones, no internet.. poor lost animals :( 




 Hello! I love your music and saw your concert in Dallas last year and it was mindblowing. It was my boyfriend's first concert and probably his favorite, to date. We were wondering what your favorite collaborations have been and if we have any to look forward to in the near future. Thanks so much for doing this AMA! 




 not so much on the tip of my tongue since I know what it is but I can't find the video where Ken Jennings answers a Jeopardy question with "what be ebonics?". can anyone help?
