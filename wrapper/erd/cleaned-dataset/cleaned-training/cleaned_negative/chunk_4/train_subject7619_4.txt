 The US declares tomorrow that all troops worldwide are to return home by the end of 2014. All US presence beyond our own borders is removed globally. A doctrine of isolationism is implemented so far as it concerns our military and foreign aid. We don't send troops, we don't drone strike, we don't bomb, we don't sanction, we don't diddly squat.

What would happen? 



















 The easy method is Batman's birthday, 1985 deduced from Batman #010, Year Zero Directors Cut. Bruce Wayne is Born. (Date inferred Willowood and Wayne Death correlations. Willowood fell into disrepute after Martha died when Bruce was 10, but it was likely not that long after, and the sickhole happened 18 years ago. This also correlates to Bruce taking off as soon as possible, 18, which is consistent with everything else.) 

Thomas   Martha are murdered when Bruce is 10 in 1995. Damian is born in 1999 (Batman   Robin #0) somehow even though Bruce Wayne would only be 14 and doesn't leave Gotham until 2000 (Batman #0). Bruce returns to Gotham in 2004 (Detective Comics #0). He's now 19. Damian would be 5 going by this insanity.

In 2005, Bruce is a vigilante trying to save Gotham City from The Red Hood and his gang (Batman #0).

2006: Tim Drake attends Graystone Academy (in Middle School) as their top academic student and is taking gymnastics. He hacked the school's network and caught the principal embezzling funds and turned him in. At the exact same time, Jason Todd robbed a convenience store with a friend(?) who shot a scared woman. Jason in moral outrage beat his friend(?) down and allowed himself to be arrested. The Bat-Signal is lit by Commissioner Gordon for the first time. Dick Grayson's parents fall to their death due to Tony Zucco tampering with the trapeze equipment. Dick is then sent to an orphanage, The Wayne Care Center. (Batman #0)

That ***same year*** Dick Grayson becomes Robin. (Nightwing #1).

That ***same year*** Barbara Gordon becomes Batgirl.

So Bruce Wayne has been active one year as a vigilante and already has a kid sidekick and inspired a female crime fighter.

2007: Barbara gives up being Batgirl after only one year to focus on college. (Batgirl #0)

2008: Alan Moore's *The Killing Joke* happens, officially NewFiftyTwoniverse Cannon. As a reminder, Batman is apparently 23 in this book. Damian is 9 and still unknown to his father.

2009: Jason Todd resurrected. When exactly he died or became Robin is hard to figure out, but it couldn't have been for very long. Damian Wayne defeats his mother in a birthday challenge and learns Bruce Wayne is his father. Batman is 24, Damian is 10, so yes, somehow Bruce fathered Damian when he was 14 with a woman he'd never met a good six or seven years before he became Batman. WTF?

2010: The events of Batman, Inc #0 take place.

2011: The "present" of the New52 launch in most titles which has advanced generally in real time since.

So Batman/Bruce Wayne is roughly 29 and has managed to have four Robins in a vigilante/costumed adventurer/superhero career of about nine years. By DC compressing decades of continuity to keep all these characters they've built and established, Batman has Dick Greyson as a costumed sidekick almost immediately, loses him when Dick starts the first Titans--vaguely referenced in Red Hood   The Outlaws--Batman almost instantly replaces Dick with Jason who must then die almost the next day, then he gets replaced by Tim who goes off and forms the current Teen Titans, and then Damian comes along, who Bruce apparently fathered at age 14 because that makes sense.

DC Comics has created a clusterfuck of plotholes in their new timeline.

***EDIT***

To offer what would make more sense if I was running this shit:

Martha   Thomas murdered when Bruce is 10.

Bruce returns to Gotham at age 18 after training all over the world. He does the masked vigilante bullshit for about a year, has little luck, is about to give it up when ***BAM!!!*** the bat thing happens and he's inspired. Becomes Batman, a complete badass but inexperienced. Suit is too armored because he's not too good at dodging bullets yet, and he relies too heavily on Alfred and technology to get by. 19-year-old Batman is nothing like the Batman we know and love, but DC sells his stories in the monthly back-in-the-day series called "Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight." These stories are interesting because we see a flawed Batman who doesn't always win his fights, fucks up, fails, and hasn't mentally killed off Bruce Wayne yet. He's still trying to balance Bruce and the bat because he hasn't realized he needs to sacrifice his life to become the hero Gotham needs.

Five years later, Batman is getting insanely good. He's dropped a lot of the tech and armor in favor of lightweight, stealth, ninja shit. He looks more like a ninja than a stealth, militaristic man-tank. Alfred is there when he needs him, but Bruce is much more capable on his own and far less reliant on tech and gear. He's also established now. Criminals fear him and Gordon is with him rather than against him, plus, Gordon has been promoted through the ranks and is now commissioner. The Bat Signal scares the shit out of people and is a hallmark of Gotham. Batman is only 24, but 5 years in, Batman is already the stuff of legend. However, Batman has steadily taken the place of Bruce Wayne. Alfred reminds Bruce of an obligation. He attends Haly's Circus and witnesses the death of 10-year-old Dick Grayson's parents. Relates hard. Epic feels. Takes in kid as ward. Feels bad man.

Over the next year, Dick puts the pieces together. Witnesses Alfred doing his medical shit for Bruce after a bad night. Last shreds of doubt are gone: shitty fake rich dad man is Batman. Dick sees Batman as the means to get revenge on Tony Zucco. Bruce takes him under his wing, trains him, and Robin: The Boy Wonder is born. Batman is 25, Robin is only 11. They are the Dynamic Duo, forming one of the greatest relationships in comics. DC sells the stores of this time period as Robin: The Boy Wonder. Great comic. Such sales. When Dick is 16, they have a falling out. Five years of Batman   Robin comes to an end at Dick goes off to found the original Teen Titans. Batman grows dark as shit without Robin to balance him out. Batman is now 30. 

Also noteworthy: the original Batgirl, Barbara Gordon, begins and ends in this time period. When Batgirl first appears, Batman is 26, Robin is 12, and Barbara is 17. Batman disapproves, Robin crushes hard. The three end up making a sensational team. When Batman figures out Batgirl is Barbara Gordon, he's crippled by guilt. Batgirl operates for four years, quitting at 21 only to be shot through the spine by The Joker in a home invasion because The Killing Joke is cannon forever. 30-year-old Batman is mentally broken by this incident, and it drives Dick away. He's losing his shit.

At age 22, Barbara Gordon becomes The Oracle, an essential part of Batman's operation and lending support to Dick's Teen Titans. Batman is now 31. Bruce and Dick speak to each other only through Barbara and are otherwise estranged. Dick is now Nightwing. At age 23, Oracle founds The Birds of Prey, passing on the Batgirl identity to either Cassandra Cain. She also works closely with her best friend and ally The Black Canary, Stephanie Brown AKA: The Spoiler, and Helena Bertinelli AKA: The Huntress. Batman is now 32 and a 15-year-old kid named Tim Drake has figured out his identity.

Tim Drake is obsessed with Batman   Robin. Batgirl, too. He's a boy genius, a black belt, the top student in his school, and has hacking skills second only to Barbara. He wants to be the new Robin, and nothing Bruce says or does as Bruce or Batman will change his mind. Barbara tricks Bruce and Dick into meeting. Bruce eventually reveals the Tim Drake problem, and Dick says he already knows. How? Barbara. Dick surprises Bruce by encouraging him to take the boy under his wing like he did for him because Batman needs a Robin, but it can't be Dick anymore. 

Batman has a Robin again. Batman is 33. Tim is 16, the same age Dick was when he left Bruce's side. DC explores these stories in the ongoing Batman   Robin comic as well as Gotham Knights, a book featuring the dream team of Batman, Robin, Nightwing, Batgirl, Oracle, and other Gotham vigilantes inspired by Batman like Huntress, The Spoiler, Catwoman, Batwoman, etc.

You'll notice Jason Todd didn't exist. No one other than Dick   Tim have ever been Robin, and if Damian Wayne is going to be introduced, it hasn't happened yet but could down the line, preferably around the same time Bruce is either about to die or retire so Dick can become Batman and Damian his Robin.

Realistically, Batman either dies in the line of duty before he ever makes it to 40 or retires to be replaced by Dick Grayson either way.

I'm sorry, but you don't just go through sidekicks like dirty laundry. It's ridiculous. 
























 I once had a can of Easy Cheese but no Ritz crackers so... 



















 I'm 33, I want to buy a house, my credit is terrible (599), and I have no savings. 

Can I still do this? Is there a zero down option? Where do I even begin?

 









 I'm 33 and I want to buy a house. I'm tired of wasting money on rent. That being said, I've found it impossible to save the kind of money to make a serious down payment. Can I borrow 100% of the cost and accept a higher monthly mortgage? 




 My wife and I just moved from San Antonio, Texas to Laconia, New Hampshire. We are currently unemployed, just about run out of money, and have no insurance. My daughter is complaining of pretty severe tooth pain, and there's an obvious cavity. What can we do?

 I left NH for two years, came back, and suddenly Molly doesn't exist? 




 So I have an idea. My wife doing what she does for a living (outreach therapist) gets exposed to all these kids who get flat out rejected by their own families for being gay. Some get kicked out, others are simply made to feel like they're less-than-human, others want to kill themselves upon finding themselves unloved by their own families, etc.

That's all a whole lot of bullshit.

So I want to start an orphanage of sorts. Anyone from anywhere in the US finds themselves in one of these shitty situations, they can move into the Jackson Pride: A Sanctuary for LGBT Youth. Until they're 18, they'd have a safe place to stay where they are loved and supported by a staff made up of LGBT and LGBT-friendly people such as myself.

I'd need a shitload of money. It'd have to be grants and charitable donations because I can't see any way to make such a thing profitable. Does anyone have the first clue where to start on a thing like this? This might be my calling.

 Before anyone corrects me, I'm not claiming this is The Great Gatsby: A Phantom Menace. But...

Aside from names, it's basically what logically happens before The Great Gatsby. 

Jay Gatsby is Dexter. 

Comes from middle class family. Father owns the second-best grocery store in town.

Aspires to be part of the old money, upper crust elite.

Meets Judy/Daisy.

Loves her. Loses her because she's old money elite; he's not. 

Couple of affairs.

Loser in love. Goes to war as we know Gatsby did. Never forgets her.

He returns. Gets filthy rich. Success. Still loves Judy/Daisy. Finds out from a friend that she's married now and the guy is a dick. Name is Joe Simms but he sounds an awful lot like Tom Buchanan. He cheats on her just like Tom. She doesn't cheat. She stays home with the kids.

He's still alive at the end and very much contemplating the Judy/Daisy situation.

 Batman and all his allies defending Gotham City featuring Batman (Bruce Wayne), Robin (Damian Wayne), Red Robin (Timothy Drake), Nightwing (Dick Grayson), Spoiler (Stephanie Brown), Batgirl (Cassandra Caine), Oracle (Barbara Gordon), Huntress (Helena Bertinelli), The Red Hood (Jason Todd), Catwoman (Selina Kyle), Black Canary (Dinah Lance), Katana (Tatsu Yamashiro), Cheshire (Jade Nguyen), Batwoman (Katie Kane), Ragman (Rory Regan), and maybe even some variation of Azrael and/or Batwing.

Additional cast featuring Alfred, Lucius Fox, Commissioner Gordon, Rene Montoya, Detective Alvarez, Harvey Bullock, Harvey Dent, Maggie Sawyer, Leslie Thompkins, and Vicki Vale.

You don't have to get all detailed about each character's origins or how they ended up where they are, and it'd be largely based on Morrison's "Batman, Inc." run, which means it involves Talia's all-out assault on Gotham, a call to arms of all Batman's allies, Bruce Wayne is out as Batman's financial backer, Damian dies, and there's a fuckload of cameos. Three-hour epic.

 Before anybody tells me about Monster, jobs.com, etc., yes, I know. I'm exploring those, but /r/sanantonio has been awesomely helpful with everything I've ever needed.

I'm 32, I have an associates in graphic design, I have experience as a delivery driver, I don't mind desk or labor work, I'd prefer first shift, I'd consider part time or full, benefits aren't needed, I look professional (no visible tats or piercings of any kind), I'm reliable, have reliable transportation (2009 Scion XB), I'm in school for English education, and I've been a substitute teacher. 

Any leads would be appreciated. 





























 As insane as this sounds, I've done the research. It's plausible. The idea isn't original; it was first proposed by Carlyle Thompson, a professor of African American and American literature at Medgar Evers College of the City University of New York. There's actually quite a bit of evidence to support it, just as there is to support the queer reading of Nick.

Gatsby is described by Nick, "his tanned skin" and "short hair look as though it were trimmed every day" (Fitzgerald 50). The short hair and the appearance of daily trimmings could definitely refer to the grooming habits of African American men.

Gatsby's West Egg mansion is on "more than 40 acres of lawn and garden" (Fitzgerald 5), which is specifically interesting, because freed slaves were to be given 40 acres and a mule by decree of Sherman's Special Field Orders, No. 15. "More than" is stated, but instead of giving us that exact number--it could be 41 acres or 400--but we're given 40. It should be noted that 40 acres and a mule was oft promised, but a promise not always kept and inconsistently applied (Oubre 79). There's an obvious metaphor for a man who feels deserving of something he doesn't get, i.e., Daisy.

Gatsby would be unlikely to achieve the level of success he did in the roaring 20s if he were black, and some of the upper-crust white folk would be likely to notice or take issue with his race, so it's only a plausible theory if he were able to pass himself off as white. There is evidence for this, too. For one, the manner in which he makes his fortune is bootlegging during prohibition, and bootlegging is a sort of counterfeit product. That could be a metaphor as Gatsby is a counterfeit person. He pretends to be someone he's not, he seeks an imagined perfection of a flawed woman, he lies about his past, he's secretive about what he does and his intentions, and being a man of color could be just one more lie he's living. He's even changed his name from Gatz to Gatsby, something more Nordic-sounding.

Gatsby is quite proud of his heroism in Montenegro. Of all the places he could have earned a medal, it's one where the word "negro" is right in the name--negro/black, mont/mountain--and it's mentioned by name seven times immediately like Fitzgerald wanted it to stand out. Also, his valor at Montenegro was immediately proved true by the medal Gatsby carried around. In other words, Gatsby lies, but the "negro" part is the truth.

How do we know he lies? He just told us on the previous page, "I am the son of some wealthy people in the Middle West--all dead now" (Fitzgerald 65). We know for a fact later on that his father remains alive and is far-from-wealthy. Was his family dead, or was he dead to his family on account of his color? "I was brought up in American but educated at Oxford, becaue all my ancestors have been educated there for many years. It's a family tradition" (Fitzgerald 65). He's awfully concerned with establishing a European heritage.

But here's the passage that really blew my mind with this reading:

        ...a limousine passed us, driven by a white
        chauffeur, in which sat three modish Negroes, two bucks and a girl. I
        laughed aloud as the yolks of their eyeballs rolled toward us in
        haughty rivalry.

        "Anything can happen now that we've slid over this bridge," I thought;
        "anything at all. . . ."

        Even Gatsby could happen, without any particular wonder. (Fitzgerald 69)

First, let's note that this happens as they are crossing Blackwell's island. Again, a geographical location is used that denotes "black."

According to Merriam-Webster's online dictionary, "Modish" means "Conforming to or following what is currently popular and fashionable." In other words, these are African American men who turned the social paradigm on its head and are being driven by a white chauffeur. In spite of a possible slave heritage, they are able to afford the luxuries of the time, looking at Gatsby, his ride, and his present company with a sense of rivalry. If these black men are able to realize the American dream, surely a man of African descent who can pass for white can achieve this success. Yes, anything is possible, even Gatsby. Even a black Gatsby.

There are smaller clues, too. After Myrtle is struck by a car, the incoherent speech of a man is "M-a-v-r-o----," which is interesting, because "mavro" is Greek for "black."

One the same page, a "pale well-dressed negro" described the car, Gatsby's car, as "big" and "yellow." Now back to the Montenegro thing, which literally means "black mountain," which may describe Gatsby, big and yellow may also describe him as "high yellow" was a term to describe light-skinned blacks, the product of mixed race backgrounds due to the golden skin tone (Dalzell, 2009). He may be a "black mountain" of a man, but he's also "high" like a mountain, but, although technically black, also "yellow."

Is this a meaningless distinction? No. It's not trivial at all. Tom Buchanan is an awful human being, and we're treated to Tom's racist rant:

        Have you read 'The Rise of the Coloured Empires' by this man Goddard? . . . Well, it's a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. The idea is if we don't look out the white race will be--will be utterly submerged. It's all scientific stuff; it's been proved. . . Well, these books are all scientific . . . This fellow has worked out the whole thing. It's up to us who are the dominant race to watch out or these other races will have control of things . . . This idea is that we're Nordics. I am, and you are and you are and . . . and we've produced all the things that go to make civilization--oh, science and art and all that. (Fitzgerald 12-13)

How are we supposed to feel about this? Well, Daisy openly mocks him and Nick says he's pathetic. Tom believes that the Nordics are the master race and that it's imperative for him and people like him to keep the colored folk down. Wouldn't there then be great irony on his wife's competing love with a non-Nordic person? A black Gatsby?

It's at least a suspicion on Tom's part when he puts the pieces together and outs his fears:

        I suppose the latest thing is to sit back and let Mr. Nobody from Nowhere make love to your wife. Well, if that's the idea you can count me out. . . . Nowadays people begin by sneering at family life and family institutions and next they'll throw everything overboard and have intermarriage between black and white. (Fitzgerald 130)

        "We're all white here," murmured Jordan. (Fitzgerald 130)

Not only does Tom suggest that Gatsby is black, Jordan picks up on it and defends his whiteness! Why else would intermarriage between black and white even be brought up? He may have even suspected this for a long time before, pausing before he includes Daisy as a Nordic in the Goddard rant with a wink and a smile when he lays out the Goddard nonsense. Perhaps he sees her as sullied having had her history with Gatsby.

The trouble is, there's plenty of evidence to suggest that Fitzgerald was both a racist and antisemitic (Blogger.com 2010). That really changes the perspective. That underscores what Fitzgerald's true intentions were in the Goddard passage from the book, actually The Rising Tide of Color: Against White World-Supremacy, by eugenicist Lothrop Stoddard, published in 1920 (Turlish 1973). Fitzgerald was obviously familiar with it. It's even more interesting to note that both Fitzgerald and Stoddard had the same publisher, Scribner. As for the name change, Henry H. Goddard was a famous eugenicist (Thompson 2004). The plot thickens.

It forces one to consider that Gatsby is a cautionary figure, that negro men could be among us, passing themselves off as white, throwing lavish parties, living the lifestyle, wooing our women, acting as elaborate con artists, bootlegging, and involved in all manner of illicit affairs. Maybe that's the real reason he doesn't win in the end. Maybe that's why he's killed, as white men conspire against him. Maybe that's the real reason no one shows up to his funeral.

* Sign up for classes. Exercise doesn't have to mean treadmills, ellipticals, or weights. Try new things, meet new people, and have fun. Try yoga. Try zumba. Try boot camp. Try core training. Try belly dancing and/or pole dancing if you must. Be adventurous.
    

* Have a run first thing in the morning when you wake up. It'll jolt you to life, give you more energy, almost guarantee you'll make time for a healthy breakfast, and once you're showered, you'll be good to go, probably in a better mood to boot. Go get life.
   

* Meet a friend at your scheduled gym at scheduled times or activities so you'd feel bad leaving them hanging. Tell that friend to give you a hard time if you skip a day or slack.
    
* Don't feel like going? Go. Tell yourself you'll phone it in today. Tell yourself you'll take it easy. Showing up is half the battle. Once you're there, you'll probably feel like you might as well get a good workout in if you're there anyway.
    
* Set realistic goals for yourself. Put them down on paper.


* Skip escalators and stairs, walk or ride your bike if it's not too far, park further away from the grocery store, and find other little ways to work in extra exercise into your daily life.


* Reward yourself for meeting goals/expectations, but not with cake and pies. 




 Do you prefer one above all others? Do some ethnicities do things or have characteristics that you find sexy or a turn-off? Were you consciously trying to have sex with a variety of races? How would you rate your experiences overall?

Curious because I'm a married white male who has only had sex with white women, not by choice, but because New Hampshire is a very white place. I assume I'll die never having known the difference, assuming there are any. 




 Booster Gold   Blue Beetle! Hollywood is missing out on a great opportunity to make a superhero/comic book movie that is completely unlike the rest, and actually use it to satire superhero/comic book movies. It could have plenty of action, but also a lot of comedy, and more bromance than JD   Turk in a season of Scrubs. 









 A friend posted in our local (San Antonio) Facebook forum asking advice for overcoming writer's block. People seemed to like my response, so I thought I'd share:

You're over-thinking it. Stop. A*** A**** has great advice, but if you're not in the reading mood, don't do that either. Don't do anything, writing especially. If you're a comedian, funny things will come to you. You have a gift for being able to see the comedy in situations people experience every day of their lives, but they either don't see it or make the normal choice not to make a big deal of it. That's YOUR job.

If nothing is coming to you, don't panic. This is a great time to pull out your old jokes. If they're in a notebook, transcribe them to a Word document or otherwise create a document you can organize. Re-read your jokes. Try to approach those jokes from different angles. Figure out a way to connect jokes where some continuity may exist for good transitions. If you need better transitions, write those.

Think of that time some dumb drunk bitch said some dumb drunk bitch thing during your set. Now think of what you wish you had said to her. Maybe it's about her being a dumb drunk bitch. Now you have heckler ammo in your pocket.

Write and re-write your old shit and before you know it, you'll be writing new shit because you just inspired yourself to write and be creative.

If you car won't start, you give it a jump. That's all you need. The car is fucking fine.

 




 My wife and I are happily married and new San Antonio residents as of last year. Our 5th anniversary is this weekend, and I'm hoping to take her out on a hot date. Money is not an issue. I just want it to be memorable. 

She's an artist, very into dance, music, or any kind of art, really. It doesn't have to be anything like that, either, just a fun night out on the town.

I haven't lived here long enough to know where to go/what to do. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated! 




 ***Tax exemptions for churches violate the separation of church and state*** enshrined in the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment of the US Constitution. By providing a financial benefit to religious institutions, government is supporting religion. Associate Justice of the US Supreme court, William O. Douglas, in his dissenting opinion in Walz v. Tax Commission of the City of New York, decided May 4, 1970, stated: "If believers are entitled to public financial support, so are nonbelievers. A believer and nonbeliever under the present law are treated differently because of the articles of their faith I conclude that this tax exemption is unconstitutional."

***A tax exemption is a privilege, not a right.*** Governments have traditionally granted this privilege to churches because of the positive contribution they are presumed to make to the community, but there is no such provision in the US Constitution.

***Churches receive special treatment from the IRS beyond what other nonprofits receive***, and such favoritism is unconstitutional. While secular charities are compelled to report their income and financial structure to the IRS using Form 990 (Return of Organization Exempt From Income Tax), churches are granted automatic exemption from federal income tax without having to file a tax return.

***A tax break for churches forces all American taxpayers to support religion***, even if they oppose some or all religious doctrines. As Mark Twain argued: "no church property is taxed and so the infidel and the atheist and the man without religion are taxed to make up the deficit in the public income thus caused."

***A tax exemption is a form of subsidy, and the Constitution bars government from subsidizing religion.*** William H. Rehnquist, then-Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court, declared on behalf of a unanimous court in Regan v. Taxation with Representation (1983): "Both tax exemptions and tax deductibility are a form of subsidy that is administered through the tax system. A tax exemption has much the same effect as a cash grant to the organization of the amount of tax it would have to pay on its income."

***The tax code makes no distinction between authentic religions and fraudulent startup "faiths,"*** which benefit at taxpayers' expense. In spring 2010, Oklahoma awarded tax exempt status to Satanist group The Church of the IV Majesties. In Mar. 2004, the IRS warned of an increase in schemes that "exploit legitimate laws to establish sham one-person, nonprofit religious corporations" charging $1,000 or more per person to attend "seminars." The Church of Scientology, which TIME Magazine described in May 1991 as a "thriving cult of greed and power" and "a hugely profitable global racket," was granted federal income tax exemption in Oct. 1993. The New York Times reported that this "saved the church tens of millions of dollars in taxes." 

***Churches serve a religious purpose that does not aid the government***, so their tax exemptions are not justified. Tax exemptions to secular nonprofits like hospitals and homeless shelters are justified because such organizations do work that would otherwise fall to government. Churches, while they may undertake charitable work, exist primarily for religious worship and instruction, which the US government is constitutionally prevented from performing.

***Exempting churches from taxation costs the government billions of dollars in lost revenue***, which it cannot afford, especially in tough economic times. According to former White House senior policy analyst Jeff Schweitzer, PhD, US churches own $300-$500 billion in untaxed property. New York's nonpartisan Independent Budget Office determined in July 2011 that New York City alone loses $627 million in property tax revenue. Lakewood Church, a "megachurch" in Houston, TX, earns $75 million in annual untaxed revenue, and the Church of Scientology's annual income exceeds $500 million.

***Despite the 1954 law banning political campaigning by tax-exempt groups, many churches are clearly political and therefore should not be receiving tax exemptions***. Every fall, the Alliance Defense Fund, a Christian legal group, organizes "Pulpit Freedom Sunday," encouraging pastors to defy IRS rules by endorsing candidates from the pulpit. More than 500 pastors participated in Oct. 2011, yet none lost their churches' exemption status. In Oct. 2010, Minnesota pastor Brad Brandon of Berean Bible Baptist Church endorsed several Republican candidates and dared the "liberal media" to file complaints with the IRS. Brandon later announced on his radio program: "I'm going to explain to you what happened Nothing happened."

***American taxpayers are supporting the extravagant lifestyles of wealthy pastors***, whose lavish "megachurches" accumulate millions of tax-free dollars every year. US Senator Chuck Grassley, MA (R-IA) launched an investigation into these groups in Nov. 2007 after receiving complaints of church revenue being used to buy pastors private jets, Rolls Royce cars, multimillion-dollar homes, trips to Hawaii and Fiji, and in one case, a $23,000, marble-topped chest of drawers installed in the 150,000 square foot headquarters of Joyce Meyer Ministries in Fenton, Missouri.

***The tax break given to churches restricts their freedom of speech because it deters pastors from speaking out for or against political candidates***. As argued by Rev. Carl Gregg, pastor of Maryland's Broadview Church, "when Christians speak, we shouldn't have to worry about whether we are biting the hand that feeds us because we shouldn't be fed from Caesar/Uncle Sam in the first place." 

***The "parsonage exemption" on ministers' homes makes already-wealthy pastors even richer at taxpayers' expense.*** The average annual salary for senior pastors with congregations of 2,000 or more is $147,000, with some earning up to $400,000. In addition to the federal exemption on housing expenses enjoyed by these ministers, they often pay zero dollars in state property tax. Church leaders Creflo and Taffi Dollar of World Changers Church International had three tax-free parsonages: a million-dollar mansion in Atlanta, GA, a two-million-dollar mansion in Fayetteville, GA, and a $2.5 million Manhattan apartment. Kenneth and Gloria Copeland, leaders of Kenneth Copeland Ministries in Fort Worth, TX, live in a church-owned, tax-free $6.2 million lakefront parsonage.

 Going out again? Put on new socks. Go through five pairs a day if you have to.

I knew a guy who had awful foot odor. His shoes always stank, and so did his feet. Then I realized, he'd put on socks after he showered in the morning, put on shoes, go about his day, come home, take off the shoes, and leave his socks on. If he went back out, same nasty-ass socks with all that same sweat and bacteria now going back in the same nasty-ass shoes. 

Then I realized A LOT OF PEOPLE DO THIS!!!

Fresh socks every time, people, and when you're not wearing shoes, remove socks. Bleach the white ones. 




 Has anyone used a pet-shipping service they could recommend/trust? 



























































 **THE BEST**

Batgirl started off weak in my opinion but grew on my quickly.

Batman started strong and stayed strong. It's one of the best books DC publishes.

Batman and _________ (formerly "Batman   Robin") instantly had me hooked, but it's gotten weird since Damian died. Batman has been increasingly more and more out-of-character, but I'm holding out hope it leads somewhere.

Batman Incorporated... you love Grant Morrison or you hate him. I'm glad I toughed it out. It's a slow burn, but it's so worth it.

Earth 2 is one title I wanted to hate from the day they announced it. Turns out I love it and highyl anticipate each issue.

Legends of the Dark Knight is one title I was so happy they brought back in its original non-canonical fuck-all form. Yeah, as a collection of stories, it's inconsistent in art and writing, but when it's on, it's on.

**THE MIDDLE**

Batman Beyond Unlimited has actually been mostly good, but I've stopping collecting simply out of disinterest.

Batwing is one I've wanted to quit repeatedly, and I hated the look of the character from the beginning, but there was always something keeping me. Just as I was about to drop the title, they brought in the new Batwing, who looks fucking amazing, and now I'm curious again. Nicely played, DC.

Batwoman isn't going to be for everyone, and I kept getting confused and frustrated, but it rewards patience, and I still believe it's got the best art/panel layouts in the business.

Talon was actually pretty good, and I gave it a few issues, but I couldn't bring myself to give a shit about the character. He seemed like just another Batman knock-off, and there's plenty. Besides, I was amazed by how shitty he looked. They had so many cool variations of the Talons and that's the design they went with?

**THE WORST**

Ame-Comi Girls intrigued me, but I'm jumping off after the Jade issue. It's pretty stupid.

Batman: Li'l Gotham isn't terrible, and it's really cute, but it's not really my thing.

Batman: The Dark Knight started off awful and continues to be awful as of issue 19. I'm been wanting to jump off since the first shitty issue, but I keep hoping it'll get better. It doesn't.

Birds of Prey started shitty and then seemed to challenge itself to get progressively shittier with every issue. They succeeded. None of their teased plot twists were enough to keep me on board.

Catwoman I almost quit repeatedly, but I got re-invested with the JLA storyline. Kitty is on a short leash.

Detective Comics: I have to stop buying this shitty comic just because of its title. It should be the flagship title of DC (Detective Comics), but it's garbage. It's been confusing, muddled, shitty shit since the first issue.

Justice League, like Detective Comics, should be one of DC's star attractions. Instead, it's a monthly clusterfuck. They couldn't even commit to the core roster, like everyone expected, which includes Cyborg, a character so fucking interesting he doesn't even have his own monthly. Thanks for overcharging for the several pages of Justice League and then Shazam's never-ending origin story stapled to the back. Is he ever actually joining the team and/or getting his own title, or is this basically Justice League/Shazam forever?

Justice League of America, the C-list of the Justice League (assuming International was the B-list) has managed to do jack shit in 3 issues, even requiring other titles for back-story and exposition. Another issue or two and I'll decide if it's worth continuing.

Nightwing is a character I love and I still had to drop this title. It started off shitty, got shittier, improved, and then went right back to shitty. I guess I'll never know what happens in Chicago.

Red Hood   The Outlaws is a title I fully expected to love. I... can't... get... into it. I seem to enjoy Jason more when he appears in other books. He'd probably be better solo.

Suicide Squad is a title I started off enjoying and the cliffhangers kept me buying, but a comic can only insult my intelligence so many times before I give it the boot. Sorry slutty Harley Quinn. I liked you better in the jester costume.

Teen Titans is a title I wanted to love since I grew up a fan of the older Titans teams and enjoyed the anime-style cartoon, but what a shit-pile. I kept hoping it'd get better as it got worse and worse. I quit.

**HAVEN'T READ**

Batman: Arkham Unhinged

Injustice: Gods Among Us

 I haven't been here 8 months and I've been too busy to sight-see. We're doing the obvious stuff: tower dinner, Alamo, River Walk, etc., but what are some need-to-see places and must-eat restaurants? I want them to have a good time, and I'd like to at least pretend I'm less of a tourist than they are.

INB4: I know how to use Google. I just figure legit San Antonio natives will know a little better than tourist websites.

Also, I'm aware there's a FAQ. It's extremely incomplete and honestly not that helpful. 




 New in town and I'd like to take my 3-year-old daughter.
