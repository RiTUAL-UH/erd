 I can also add 100 dollars of my own money as well.

I want to be able to record my vocals and some live guitar/bass/drums.

what say you

:) 









 Saturday while I was on the highway all of a sudden my truck slipped out of gear revving the hell out of my engine. Now, It wont work in D or R. 1st and second still work manually. They kind of go into D and R and feels like it starts to go but not really. It moves a tiny bit.
I went and pulled the codes

P0735

P1270

B1600

P0171

None of this looks good.
In have had a strange electrical issue for a while. Says door is ajar when its not, engine light go on and off, blinker is sparatic and makes a gritty noise half the time. After all this went down now the blinker works absolutely perfect while it hasn't since I've owned it.
Anyone advice on where I should start besides of course bringing it the shop. Im going crazy not knowing and nobody is around until tomorrow. 





























 I played every day for about 2 years while I was living out in Seattle. I sure miss it. Thought I would check on here to see if anyone was near me to play sometime...and where? 














 If so, how was the experience? 

4 year degree, trade school or whatever. 

Any financial aid? 

Any tips?

Reason being I am tired of what I've been doing all along. I never went to school and there is no future (that I want) financially in what I currently do.

 




 Along the lines of the ones we did in high school but maybe something that takes into account what we have already done so far.
 





























 I'm talking about a 3 bedroom house with full attic and a shed that i just need to rig for year round heat. 

i now only really have late nights etc for the recording. 
























 I'll leave mine in the comments.  





























 Specifically 11/26/78 




 Why don't I see usernames on posts when they are links?  



















 Check out the entrance to America's favorite past time. ;)  




 These guys give out an outrageous amount of fries when you order them.  

Next and last clue at 1130 




 **SUPER DUPER SECRET SCAVENGER HUNT THING**

It's the city where [these guys formed](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe4EK4HSPkI)

Next clue will be coming around 11 am, ensuring anyone who wants or has the time to get in on it...can. 

 



















 Just shoot us mods a message or make it known in this thread. 

This year me and my SO both have parents in the midst of serious health issues whom both reside in separate states far too many miles apart.  Meaning I will be doing a much smaller dinner at home.

Location is Deep River

 









 I can't. What's up with that?  




 Last week redditgifts sent us mods a message informing us that a user would be posting clues to the secret box in this subreddit, and to keep it a secret. 

It somehow ended up in /r/hartford. Nothing against /r/hartford (they are a fine upstanding subreddit) but they have about 8,000 less subscribers. 

To ensure that the rest of connecticut gets to partake in this I am doing my own. 

**THE SUPER DUPER SECRET SCAVENGER HUNT THING**

To keep it relevant and not lose steam I am having it this Sunday (11/23). Be sure to keep your eyes peeled to /r/connecticut Sunday at around 8AM for the riddles/clues/etc.

The first clue will point towards the general area of the state and the next clue will be given after there is ample time for anyone from any corner of the state to make it to that area...ensuring everyone can get in on it.

I promise the box won't suck. 























































































































 Even on the cleanest of settings I'm getting a nasty fuzz . 




 Almost so much that I don't even read them. It's just become a free ad space for them to promote whatever they are releasing. 

In New York releasing a movie/book? Stop by and see Victoria.  














 I will be using an acoustic guitar, electric bass, electric guitar, drum set and a midi keyboard. I will only be recording solo. I already have

1. Garageband
2. Magellan
3. DM1
4. Funkbox
5. MusicStudio 2
6. Loopy HD

What I am wondering is what should I get for an audio interface and vocal/acoustic guitar mic? Thinking of getting a mixer for the acoustic drum recording. (want to make sure what I get is compatible)

I am going to use my bestbuy credit card to get the interface and mic. 

Whats my best bet guys/gals?

Thank you. :) 




 Anybody found a really good realistic sounding drum app? 



















 Been hearing how horrible this is going to be in the winter. It's 4x4 but that's only good for certain elements. 

What is your experience/tips/tricks?

My only other 4x4 experience was with a 97 jeep grand Cherokee Laredo. Otherwise I have owned front wheel drive sedans. 




 It's from their song Sweet Home Alabama.  





























 I'm noticing how many people coming into this cancer wing just reek of cigarettes. So many sick looking people. Fuck cigarettes. 

Obviously not every person who has cancer is because of smoking or vice versa. It's just what is in my face right now.  














 Whenever I click a vimeo link it just goes black or kind of freezes.  






















































 I got free tickets for it. What should I expect? Anyone? 



















 fuck, though. I need my garageband open to record some bad ass shit that wont go anywhere.

not kiding. 





























 Need to catch up a bit 







































 Thats right. Give me a tag line and a name. Like this.

1. Crazy shit

2. CriT 




 The Fuck. Is Wrong With U! 









 Sitting here in my shed/workshop with a few drinks and a joint. Man, this album is fucking top notch. Been years since I gave it a good spin. It was that time when I could hear Beck starting to get serious with his songwriting, if you  know what I mean.  





































































 Anyone know what I mean? 


































 What do I need to make this work? I also have I an maudio fast track.

Thank  you much in advance. :) 




 What do I need to do to make this work? I've also got an m-audio fast track interface.

Thank you in advance :) 




 I use and love baconreader for my phone (galaxy s4.) I can't for the life of me figure out how to view my own profile in the iPad version. 



















 Been using Microsoft and Android my entire life (I'm 35).
I bought it manly for the use of and easy access to GarageBand. Android doesn't have anything close for me. 

I'm new here guys. What do I need to know?


So far the main thing I have an issue with is the keyboard. I'm very used to swift key on my galaxy s4. Gotta say this thing has a very high quality feel.

 I have been having smoking dreams in the past week or so. One so vivid that I recall telling people in my dream that I just gave up 11 months. I recall saying it was gross and not finishing it. I didn't even finish it in my dream. 

I am on the wagon so I think that's why my dreams have been so much more vivid. 

You guys get these dreams even almost a year into no cigarettes? 


































 I could clean up a 7 computer pretty well. What should I look out to get rid of on this one? 














 Dude probably looks pissed off while eating lobster as he gets a blow job.  



















 Plan on getting a tablet for just this. Also a mic that works well with this? 

Edit: **MULTITRACKING** 
























 I just had a nightmare last night (not something I normally have) that I watched a friend from high school get mauled by a grizzly.


I haven't seen this kid in 20 years. I've never seen a bear in real life. 

In the dream I was hanging out with a bunch of friends from high school (in high school times) and there happened to be a bunch of bears around. We all notice one that snuck up on us. I bolted for the car and got in along with a few of my other friends. My other friend, Dan didn't make it and I watched him get torn apart by this bear right up against the car.


I woke up as the bear had begun prying/tearing the door apart next to me. 




 So discouraging. I need to massage the hell out of my calves and up my legs to my butt. My stamina is fine. I was barely winded.  




 VIN# JTEES43A482008044 









 Lets hear them. :) 





























 With all of the advances we have had over the years with computers why are we still using the ump behind the plate? 



















 [Here are my stats](http://www.rundouble.com/user/fb:604245161/E4jLy5cB)

W2D1 was very rewarding and fairly easy. Today was a beast. I may be getting shin splints, I'm not sure. The pain was almost unbearable. Also, all of the other days I felt really good and after each workout and even sometimes got that extra burst of energy. Today afterwards I really hurt, felt exhausted and almost sick to my stomach. What am I doing wrong? I stretch before each workout. Maybe not enough? 





























 I have for many years claimed he is my favorite musician/songwriter. I was introduced to him through a friend who got some shit from some skater magazine back in early high school. That is where it began. 

Long story short...it stuck.

This last show in Providence was the first time I saw him perform in over 10 years. Life just happens. We miss simple things. This performance reminded me to never let them slip by. I don't mean just Beck but any band/musician you are into. Just make it fucking happen. 

I had such a blast, enjoyed every minute of the show and just became  even more of a fan of his catalogue. 

Side note. I became a musician because of Beck and now that i have settled down and have some stability in my ,life I am slowly gathering equipment again to produce.  



















 Scanning this sub and I'm noticing a lot of complaints.  









 I just barely made it but I did.  




 Lets meet up for a drink before or after and do a cheesy /r/beck pic for the sub. Why not, right? 









 We will be in town for a concert tomorrow night and have a hotel in the city. We want to spend the day at the beach and maybe even sunday late morning as well. I want to know from the locals which is the best for travel between the hotel and the beach. We arent coming from far (next state over) but thought I would ask you guys for the best advice. Thank you much. :)
