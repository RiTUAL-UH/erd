 Thank you Based Al. 




 Gotta love people downvoting the true sauce. Have an upvote. 




 If you keep chopping wavelets in half, you just get smaller wavelets. The Boson is just more wave mechanics at a finer resolution. I don't buy this. I say they've built the right device and are now taking all the wrong readings with it. 




 COPERNICUS IS WRONG.

 LoL I want to see a Cry Engine type reaction instead where the tank just pops like a balloon from a glitch. 




 Excellent, I'll try that. 




 Thanks so much for the well wishes!

 Unknown, last had when I was a child, mother scheduled for me, had like 5 little tiny flat clear warts on my pinky knuckle and a couple others on the edge of my hand

 I had issues with this when I saw it at my house, but when I got to work here, it loaded a little slower
