 I'm building a product based on the Raspberry Pi as the control unit, but I want to modify on the design by removing some components to make it cheaper. Thanks for the link! 









 It's ideal for rapid prototyping, I'm posting on twitter with only 1 line of code from Arduino, used before in our booth during a big event and the output was amazing. 









 Hey guys, Amr here from the makers of 1Sheeld, you can chec out a lot of examples by the community on Hackster.io/1Sheeld

Also you can check out some [projects on instructables](http://www.instructables.com/howto/1sheeld/) and let me know if you need anything :) 




 That's awesome, would you share an instructable after you finish? :) 




 Okay, what are the cheapest components to assemble it? do you have a good tutorial? 














 no i don't think it will be relevant to children, especially with the gun part! 









 This one is also amazing:
