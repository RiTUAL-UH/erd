 Do you have a recommendation for an app then? Tasker seems good for the automation I need like automatically turning on mobile hotspot and such? Standing by... 














 Of course there was an unannounced fourth stop, there needs to be some sort of cameras installed along all of the road ways as a back stop for evidence. Business Camera's don't seem to work to well. In Russia all vehicles come with dash cams. 









 Yup I saw that, what a jokster. 




 Kudos to them for all of the hard work. It doesn't look easy by the way.  




 Seriously what is their problem?  




 I've actually have been surprised with all of the tales. I actually get 100 MBs where I reside it's great.  




 It was only a matter of time, he deserves it. People need to stop with the crab jokes.  




 I tried this app and its great.  




 Is there a free APK? 




 Do you have instructions? 




 I would have to go with Ugly Betty.  




 Garmin Connect and Strava.  














 I would suggest those of you that are heavy users purchase this battery. Stand by time is easily 1 day and 16 hours plus. Screen time varies between 10 and 12 hours of heavy usage. The battery is pricey at $60 dollars but totally worth it.

[Dan and Sierra discussed Mike's claims that they were at the bottom of the majority alliance; Dan later attempted to comfort Shirin about Will's comments at the previous Tribal Council. Reward challenge: Divided into two groups of four, the teams were given four barrels, two wood planks, and rope to cross the beach without any part of their bodies or the planks touching the ground, or else they had to restart. The first team across won a trip on a catamaran, complete with a feast of hamburgers and pie.
After the team of Mike, Sierra, Shirin and Rodney accidentally placed a plank on the ground, they decided to each roll on a barrel to make up time, but they were unable to do so and Carolyn, Dan, Tyler, and Will won the challenge. Back at camp, Sierra campaigned to Rodney to get rid of Tyler for being a threat and to take Shirin to the end because no one would vote for her to win, though Rodney neither believed Tyler was a threat nor trusted Shirin. On the reward trip, Carolyn, Tyler, and Will did their best to make sure Dan stayed loyal to them.
Immunity challenge: Each castaway held onto a rope handle attached to 25% of their body weight as of the beginning of the game. If the rope unspooled and the weight dropped, a bucket of water dropped on the castaway's head and they were eliminated; the last man and woman remaining won immunity.
Carolyn and Mike outlasted Shirin and Rodney to win immunity, again thwarting the majority alliance's plans. Though the majority alliance targeted Shirin, she lobbied Dan and Sierra to take out Tyler. Tyler searched through Dan's bag and discovered his extra vote advantage. Mike attempted to realign with Dan, his former closest ally, but was unsuccessful, and Mike considered playing his idol on Shirin. At Tribal Council, Shirin told everyone that getting rid of her would be a bad idea and that they should get rid of Tyler. Right before the vote, Mike unveiled his hidden immunity idol and gave it to Shirin, and claimed that Shirin was going to vote for Tyler and he was going to vote for another member of the dominant alliance, and told the other members of the alliance to vote for Tyler to ensure their safety. Ultimately, Mike did not play the idol for Shirin, but the dominant alliance called his bluff and Shirin was voted out, though Tyler and Will voted against Dan.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor:_Worlds_Apart#11)

 Ponderos is more exciting than the game right now. 




 He's definitely not showing the 3 C's. 




 Maybe next time you can post it half way through as suggested,15 votes didnt give much of a true baseline. 




 A complete 180 from the beginning of the season, everyone was on board to throw Mike overboard. 




 You can take it to the bank. 




 ELI5: What just happened? 




 We have to wait until the next episode for the six to split apart. 




 Keep voting. http://strawpoll.me/4239641/r 




 Wow, things livened up quickly. 




 I would've liked to see the poll embedded at the top or on the side updating live. 




 Tyler's in the lead, huh. 




 Maybe the necklace?
 




 The title of the episode should've been; theme of this episode: SHUT UP DAN.

 Mike's the one staying calm, cool, and collected. 




 Where? And wont that be to short of a time frame for votes? 




 Maybe the mods can pin it to the top?
 




 Is there a poll going on to see who R/Survivor things is going home tonight? 




 Dan has no idea what's going on, minuscule amount of awareness. 




 Rodney always.  C's..Cool..Calm..Collective.

 Barrel Rolling are you kidding me. 




 Voting for Will to fail. 




 How do you guys think Will 'will' perform, no pun intended. I can't wait for the animal he mimics. 




 You mean Sprint? 




 Im just here so I dont get fined. 




 Dan and Mike are very polarizing.

 Would be a great addition for the Mavs, due to his size and versatility.
