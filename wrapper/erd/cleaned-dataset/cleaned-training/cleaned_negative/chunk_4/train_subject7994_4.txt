 Obama said it was "up to the Iranians to choose their government, but sometimes their governments acts poorly". That was Obama's way of staying away from the Green Revolution controversy but claiming he was taking a stance, That is a joke. Those words had no different impact than if he really would have said "trust your Mullahs" (which he didn't). But explain exactly how Obama's mild lip-service was anything but a tacit support of the status quo in Iran.

 Were you allergic to nuts? 




 President Obama didn't support the Green Revolution in Iran at all in 2009. He sided with the Mullah's and told the people they should listen to and respect their supreme leaders. That was a blown opportunity. 




 That picture and headline made me laugh big time. 




 I demand an explanation.  




 That's funny you put the nickle there because I was not actually getting it until my brain processed the coin. Very good.
