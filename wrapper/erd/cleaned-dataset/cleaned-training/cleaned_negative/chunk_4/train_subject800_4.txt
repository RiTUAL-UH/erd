 Most of my experience was satisfiyng my domme sexual fantasies and desires, but there were also other tasks I loved to do, like going to the shop or helping her painting the room. Once she ordered me to write some tale very quickly in the typewriter while she was having a shower. She knew I like to write, so she wanted to make me practise and improve. That was nice.

I'm too lazy to cook. Maybe a domme that forced me to cook, learn more recipes and be more disciplined in my daily life would be great for me. 




 This is androgyny at its best. Makes me question my heterosexuality. Such a gorgeous human being. 




 Nice to know. I have been in a couple of dominant relationships. I've been dominant and submissive. Definitely I prefer to be submissive. You feel so great when you please your master! You have him/her in your mind all day long thinking about ways to please him/her, and that fills you with love. I miss that in a certain way.

Also, Honeybee, that's a cute nickname.

Have fun! 




 Does that collar mean you are into domination?

I wanted you. And I was looking for you.
But I couldn't find you.
I wanted you. And I was looking for you all day.
But I couldn't find you. I couldn't find you.

You're walking. And you don't always realize it,
but you're always falling.
With each step you fall forward slightly.
And then catch yourself from falling.
Over and over, you're falling.
And then catching yourself from falling.
And this is how you can be walking and falling
at the same time. 




 Germans have some word for this, for sure. 




 Oh, guys, some day I will share with you some pictures, maybe even a video, of the place I work. I work in a big public library. It has some of the most creepy spots I've ever been. Places out of public access. Some huge, long basements where you have to go down all alone, long silent corridors, an attic where the light turns off automatically after a certain time and let's you there in the middle of the almost absolut darkness and silence. 




 He said something about somebody being absentee. You know who. 




 And people browsing Reddit and playing LOL and Counter Strike. 




 Same thing happens with the term Lolita, generated after the book and the movie. 




 ... and one that actually we don't want to see. 




 So I guess if I elaborate and tell you I got hurt because of having too much sex, due to friction, and that this happened to me with two different girlfriends, you wont believe me.

Also, actually it's the first time I post in this sub. 




 They are called webcams 




 Health reasons. I got a wound in my penis fucking with one of my girlfriends, many years ago. Everytime I fucked, the wound got open and then heal again. So, the foreskin closed very tight and strangled my penis. Everytime I wanted to fuck, I had to pull the skin and open the wound again. It was painful. So I had to cut it off. 




 I feel guilty, but I laughed at the lightning striking the grave. It's like God himself had something against this poor guy. 




 Fucking while still having stitches. That's something I have to try. I have masturbated while having stitches in my dick after my circumcision, though. It was painful but also hot. I'm a little bit masochistic. 




 1. All races are equal. This has been stated by scientist many times.

2. How do you explain poor white people in first world countries? Are they like a special kind of white race people? 




 I'm not american so i didn't knew about this guy. I'm watching some videos now. Thanks. 




 Wise words 




 If you are thinking about killing yourself, maybe it's time to change some things in your life. 




 Did he fart at 8:43? 




 No. He is an artist. 




 There is also some spanking in Adventure Time.

 Maybe listening to his voice will make you feel good. You could phone him now and then or ask him to record special voice messages for you or even an audiobook. Imagine listening to an episode everytime you miss him. Wouldn't it be cool?

 I meant he is a little out of tempo in that video. 




 Now you are being rude. You are taking karma too seriously. 




 How do you punish your subs when they cum without your permission? Something easy would be giving them a good spanking, but, if they enjoy that, it would be more like a prize. Something humiliating, maybe? 




 Well, there was that thread with midget clown porn recently. It was deleted but, what was that?

 How is that? 




 Thanks for sharing this. I'm disocovering the pleasure of reading in this subreddit other people's experiences and games. 




 I'd recommend you these albums:

Lightning Bolt - Wonderful Rainbow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JpHoAnaPK0 (brutal live performance)
Techno Animal - Brotherhood of the Bomb 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIZ6G1usPXc

Food for Animals - Belly

 But where did they get the voice sample? 




 I don't know the story behind the "Quarantine the virus, god block" line. Where is it from? 




 You mean favorite moments in their songs, their career or their performances? 




 Stefan has a much softer voice than I expected. 




 Vine doesn't work in some android phones. Maybe that's your case. 




 Hey, that's Cersei! 




 She is gonna get so horny while telling you her fantasies and visualizing them. 




 This, please. Anyone? 




 Of course, she had to record that video in a dark room only lighted up with candles, with some more dolls in the background. She couldnt record it in a totally normal room at day light. 




 That's a terrible CGI work. 




 This movie is based on the premise that the deaf guy can read the lips perfectly, but actually doing this is very hard and you only get like the 10% of the oral information. I know this because I've worked with deaf people for some years. 




 When does the quantity of policemen start to be too many policemen? 




 Yeah, I know there is a lot of fucked up people in the internet. But at the beginning of this video you can see how this guy cleans a knife full of blood with  panties. That's obviously a joke.

I admit I had a moment of doubt when I played this other video and saw the obsessive mural made of cute girls photos.

Like, who the hell would be so dedicated to set the scenario for a video? But also you can see labels on the boxes: "Justin DVDs (Bieber)" and "Justin DVDs (Timberlake)". He's clearly acting. 




 I doubt this guy is really pertubed. I think he is just making art and humour. He is acting. If you watch the whole video it gets quite absurd, its just like a creepy short film. 




 someone set up us the bomb! 




 On one session my dom forbided me to close my eyes. I just keeped closing it because I was feeling such a pleasure.

Some time later we switched and she was my sub. I forbided her to speak, a different way of having control on somebody. The thing was she had to speak in sign language. I was a sing language interpreter then and I was teaching her, so it was like practising for her. It was incredibly cute to see her so quiet and trying to communicate with me with her hands. 




 You are a genius and made me laugh. Thank you very much. 




 I played my No Love Deep Web record while practicing a method my therapist taught me for releasing my anger and anxiety. It consists in hitting a phone book with a piece of plastic pipe while you scream.

So, No love was blasting, and I was hitting the phone book as hard as I could, following the ryhtm of the beats, shouting things like "I'm not gonna be sad!" and "I'm gonna be happy!".

Later I got interested in magick and occultism, so one day I tried to practise my own purification ritual. I wrote in my arm "Do what thou wilt, shall be the whole of the law", and in my leg "Love is the law, love under will" (both quotes from The book of the Law by Aleister Crowley). I cut my hair while listening to Beware. Cutting my hair had always some kind of symbolism, like leaving the old stuff behind and starting a new phase. 

I can assure you I felt quite powerful, like I was doing something really meaningful or, at least, different, as Manson spoke in the intro. Then I took a shower. 




 That moment when Come up and get me starts... Damn. If I was there I would have an orgasm. 




 Did a picture of this graffiti exist, or did I just create a fake memory? 




 If the band see this, they are gonna love it, for sure. 




 thanks

APORSIH? 




 There is nothing wrong in not being absolutely original. 




 I just realized that people have posted a lot of button-related haikus:

 I can't remember how mine ended. I guess I just stopped imagining them. 




 Ok then :) 




 Is really anybody gonna read all the bands we list in these posts? 




 Cool. I didn't knew this one. Thanks.

 It was probably just the office ghost cheking r/thebutton. 




 No. Germans are "Textura".

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackletter 




 Me and my best (girl) friend are huge fans of AT and sometimes we meet and watch the new episodes. After that we use to discuss and get to the same point: the show is getting more adult. AT started as a children show, but it got a lot of young adult fans, and they have to adapt to that. Adults want more complexity, more mature themes, deepness, sub-plots, story arcs.

But I wouldn't worry. I think the show will always preserve its touch  of innocence and be children likeable. Even in the most serious episodes, a lot of fantastic and absurd things and jokes happen. 




 Don't be such an ass. He is just trying to have a deep discussion about a show he likes. That's what boards and forums and subreddits are for, besides posting memes and jokes. 




 Well, people keep saying "Oh my God" even when Nietzsche stated very clearly that he is dead. 




 Is this really something to look at while you are stoned?
