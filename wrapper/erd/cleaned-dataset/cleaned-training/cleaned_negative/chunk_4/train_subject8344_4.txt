 A Colorado program  deemed the most successful in the country which provided birth control for teens, reduced teen pregnancy by 40%. It also reduced abortions by 35%. Republicans just voted to defund that program.


I just don't get it. I respect your right to have an opinion. But these two positions seem so counter-productive to each other. You hate abortion so much, how can you be against something that reduces it so significantly?

 I am a single 57 year old male and am thinking I should get some life insurance. Nothing extravagant. Do you have any recommendations? 


Additional information: I don;t really understand what type and how much I should get. To be honest, I'm not even sure why I need to get it. It just seems like something I should have. I make a modest income and can't afford to pay a huge amount. But if it is something I should have, I am willing to put some money toward it each month. Sorry for my lack of knowledge on this subject. Your expertise is what I am seeking.

I own a mobile home but not the land. I rent that.

 When big disasters occur, we all care and want to help if we can. But we here at /r/assistance have noticed a rash of gofundme-type fundraiser pop up when these disasters occur. There is no way we can assure the money raised from these, actually go to the cause.

Therefore we will only allow requests where the money goes directly to the relief efforts.  This rule goes into effect immediately.

 After some 40 years of smoking, I have come to use cigarettes as kind of a reward system that gets me through my work day and home life. 

Finish this and I can go have a cigarette, do 30 more of these and I can go have a cigarette, get through 30 more minutes of this and I can go have a cigarette, etc. etc. etc.

When I attempt my quit, I know this will be a **MAJOR** issue for me. I could use some food but we all know what that will lead to. I don't want to gain a lot of weight. 

I need some others rewards to pacify and motivate me to get through my day. Any suggestions?

 Today I watched the "Succubus" episode for about the tree hundred and fiddy time.  But I noticed something I had never noticed before. Do you know what character in that episode turned out to be the Loch Ness Monster?

--------------

Edit: Eric's optometrist is the Loch Ness Monster. The entire episode they make Chef's dad out as some looney who imagines everyone disguised as the Loch Ness monster asking for tree fiddy. But in the very last scene we find out that he wasn't imagining it. Watch the episode again and you will see. Eric's optometrist is the Loch Ness Monster.
Here is the script from the episode. Look at the last line. The optometrist asks Eric for three fifty.

 	Two types of nuclear weapons material: Uranium, which is mined. And Plutonium, which produced.

	Uranium needs to be about 90% pure to work in a nuclear weapon and only 5% for a power plant

	They have been enriching it to 20% - The agreement is that will stop  and they will only enrich it past 3.67% for 15 years

	They currently have 2200 pounds of the 20% enriched. They have agreed to give up 97% they already have.

	It is enriched by centrifuges.  There are two types. 

	One is designed in the 70s which runs on very old outdate software comparable to an Atari game.

	The other is a high tech version that is much faster   efficiently  Iran has none and will not be allowed to have any of these.

	Iran currently has 19,000 of the old inefficient type.

	The deal specifies this number be reduced to 6,000. And only the old and inefficient ones

	Iran would be allowed to conduct research and development on advanced centrifuges. But not produced or possess them.

	 Two ways to make plutonium: 

	Spent fuel rods used in enriching uranium can be used to make plutonium. Iran does not have this reprocessing ability. The deal specifies they cannot seek to gain this knowledge or ability and bans such processing plants.

	The second way is a reactor that is specifically designed to produce it. Iran currently has one such reactor that is not yet operational. 

	The deal specifies this core from this facility be  destroyed or removed from the country 

	Anything produced from this facility is required to be shipped out of the country.

	The other underground facility would partly converted to advanced nuclear research and the production of medical isotopes. About two thirds of its centrifuges would be removed. Foreign scientists would be present. It would have no fissile material that could be used to make a bomb.

	This was one of Israels biggest concerns 

	Unprecedented levels of inspections including on site inspectors, camera and Seals. Uranium is tracked from the time it comes out of the ground, through the processing until it is stored in cylinders. Ability to see what they are importing and exporting. Inventory control.

	Inspections anywhere in the country that could investigate suspicious sites or allegations of a covert enrichment facility. (details still be worked out)

	The issue of when the sanctions are to be removed still looms as one of the potential obstacles to a final agreement on June 30.

	UN Security Council resolutions on Irans nuclear program will be lifted simultaneously. A transparent procurement channel will be established, allowing Iran to get what it needs for civilian nuclear development while giving assurances to the world that the materials will not be diverted for non-peaceful use.

	 International cooperation to help Iran in research and development.

 So that our subscribers will have the benefit of your wisdom and knowledge at their fingertips, We here at /r/assistance have decide to compile list of resources in one handy place to put on our sidebar.

So each week we will ask you to share all your resources for one specific area.

This week it is: 

#PET CHARITIES

We have many posts for the critters that can make our life worthwhile. 

We ask that you include the following:

* **Name of the organization**

* **A link to the site**

* **The specific area it serves** (city, county, state or country)

   We'd like to get resources around the world

* **The service it provides**

Please be concise so we can put these resources in a neat and easily accessible form. Please follow us in the coming weeks as we ask for resources in other areas that are needed on a regular basis. Next week it will be for the HOMELESS. 

Let's make this the most thorough list we can. Thanks for all your help

-------------------

**Edit: Please write it in this format to make it easier to compile and list later:**


* Name of Organization 

* Link to the site

* Service provide

* Area served

This will make it much easier for me to list when I do the compilation.

 Getting older changes a guy, President Barack Obama says, and he admits he's getting crankier.

"Next week I'm signing an executive order to get off my lawn," Obama joked Saturday night at the Gridiron Club and Foundation's annual dinner. On top of that, the nation's graying chief executive says he's having trouble now with his morning cup of joe. "Coffee really disagrees with me these days," he says, "which is why John Boehner just invited coffee to address the joint House." 
























 I bought it an HTC 150 Smartphone at a cricket store. I'm good at the computer but I am having a hard time learning how to use this phone. Everyone keeps telling just keep trying, you will get it. Well I am not.

I would like to take a class to help me with it. Does anyone know of any such classes near Fullerton, CA? Or maybe a good online tutorial. Something that teaches you like you are five years old.

 AT T has pissed me off for the last time. I could go for paragraphs about how they keep raising my prices. I just want a place that I make a deal and they stick with it. I hate having to call and argue every four or five months.

I checked out Verizon, and they seem to have a decent deal but I fear all the same BS tactics of AT T. Are my fears justified. 

Do they have good service? Do they stick with their contract? Do they play games?

Would appreciate your opinions. 



























































 Right now they are showing the Search For Spock. Other shows from all the series will be shown throughout the day and night. 
























 I'm a long time cigarette smoker trying to talk myself into quitting using e-cigs. I was wondering, compared to regular cigarettes, How harmful are the e-cigs to your health? 

Let's say that on a scale of 1 - 10, regular cigarettes are a ten. What number would e-cigs rate?

   














 I remember someone making a post about it but for the life of me, I do not remember who it was.

But I want to let you know it was delicious!


Thank you so much. :D 
























 This year /r/SantasLittleHelpers brought Christmas to over 700 families proving together, we  can create miracles.

 Happy Birthday Sue - We couldn't do this without you.

**WE LOVE YA!**

 You may notice our **New User Registered** flair featured in red. This means the request is being made by an account younger than 60 days old.  We strongly suggest you take extra precautions and try to find ways to apply help more directly rather than sending cash.

We hope this tool will assist you in making more informed decisions. 


----------------------

**Other tips and tools to promote safe giving:**


* **APPLY ASSISTANCE DIRECTLY WHEN POSSIBLE!!!**  We highly recommend you pay the bill or buy the item instead of sending the money to the OP - This assures  money is going where they say it is** (EX: If someone is asking for help with a utility bill, pay that bill rather than giving the OP money)



* **ASK LOTS OF QUESTIONS IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING GIVING** - Dont be reluctant to ask  OP personal questions by PM - You wouldn't give a perfect stranger  help without  asking them a few questions - If the OP is reluctant to supply the information  by PM,  we recommend you do not give - It is up to the OP to supply you with the comfort and proof you desire and require - Get this information **BEFORE** you give!!!

* **This does not give anyone the right to  harass someone or subject them to a public trial:** - Be polite and respectful and do not make unfounded accusations. You do **not** have the right to put someone on trial - If you have concerns, contact the mods and be prepared to present proof

* **USE COMMON SENSE:** Take a moment to gather information about the requester. - Look at their overview page and history -  Gather any information  needed to pursue someone if they do not live up to their end of the bargain before you supply  assistance - Once you have given, you will not have that opportunity


----------------

**EDIT:**

* * As pointed out bt our moderator u/rhubey,  if you help someone by paying a bill for them, talk to someone from the billing department or customer service to make sure they do not keep your card information on file as the default payment card. This will avoid your card ever being used again by accident or even on purpose. Thanks you rhubey for this excellent advice. 









 I want to have a few rules appear in the box when you make a post in my subreddit. (r/assistance). You know so people can not miss it. 

Is there anyone out there that might be willing to do this for me?

 




 /r/SantasLittleHelpers brings Christmas to hundreds of families every year who wouldn't have otherwise been able to join in the giving. The only thing as awesome as the giving itself, is to see the results as pictures come in from all over the world of families opening their present on Christmas Day. 

Here is the video from Christmas 2013:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUyt_JwBDeQ

We are looking to do the same and are eagerly searching for one of you fine and talented individuals who is willing to put together a  video for Christmas 2014.

We have hundreds and hundreds of photos and have a background song already picked out. Is there someone out there who would be willing to help us out? 




 Don't do anything stupid and just stay inside. Be ready for the worst. We are here for you.  

**STAY WARM NOW!!!** 









 I am making this request on behalf of /u/justaluckyshot, one of our mods and a good friend. Yesterday he lost someone very dear to him and the family needs help with the funeral costs. I can provide a paypal address if you care to help.

Justaluckyshot is famous for helping folks out here with car problems of all kinds. He has helped so many and I am asking for help in his time of need. 









 So what do you all think of this new show that is replacing Stephen Colbert?  







































 Is there a log that will tell me who has been deleting entries on a spreadsheet and what those entries were?

There are about 12 people who have full access. I believe one of them is deleting entries that they shouldn't be. I would like to find out who and the information they have been deleting. 

If this is the wrong place to post this, please let me know.

Thank you. 









 At work I have this guy constantly telling me to relax. Actually I am very relaxed but this certain comment does kind of irk me. I'm looking for a comeback that doesn't come across like I am angry the least. Just some sort of jab to shut him up. 




 The person is a vet, already served with eviction papers. They need lots of help in many areas but my first piece of advice is to declare bankruptcy. Can you please give advice of how to declare bankruptcy in specifically in Michigan using a Paralegal.

And also if there are any option with eviction.

The user's name is /u/Alohm1ab

They really need help and might be out in the very cold streets soon. Workingon other stuff but bankruptcy seems a must here. They just owe too much money
