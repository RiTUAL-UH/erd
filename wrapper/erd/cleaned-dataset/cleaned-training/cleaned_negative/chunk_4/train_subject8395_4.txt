 I hope it does too. This week has made my holiday/brithday.  




 I have only been in Dubrovnik so far but I am going to Split next Tues. So far Dubrovnik is one of the most beautiful places i have been too with loads to do and I have only been here for three days. The city has a massive hill to the left and beautiful sea and islands to the right so gives it a look that is very hard to find in other scenery's. It is also very cheap over here as well so would highly recommend it for travelling. I could message you when I get to Split and let you know how it is over there if you would like? 




 Sophie Turner "Sansa" and Natalie Dormer "Marjorie" are reportedly shooting nearby as well so I am keeping my eye out too see if I can ambush them as well. 




 They may be. I spoke to a set worker yesterday and he said they will be filming around Croatia for the next two months. 




 Pile Gate is great, did you recognise that the little path just through the gate was where Joffrey caused the riot in Fleabottom? 




 If anyone is interested, I also put up a photo of a Season 4 set piece with the "Red Keep" in the background which I found the day before about 15 minutes away from where i met Brienne. 




 Yeah her character is meant too be unattractive by Westoros standards. She is in fact really thin, with a soft spoken British accent and so friendly. Yeah she is about 6"3. When we saw her we double taked as she did not look like Brienne apart from the height but she is really tall. 




 No I would be skeptical too. Me and my gf just managed to book the right place at the right time. Adds a new level of fun to a holiday. 




 It is one of the most beautiful cities I have ever been too. Once you get past the loads of locations they use for GoT, there is still plenty more architecture, history and natural beauty to admire. I really recommend it and it is quite cheap.
