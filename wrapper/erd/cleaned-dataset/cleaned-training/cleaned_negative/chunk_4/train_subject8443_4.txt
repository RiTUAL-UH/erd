 I've heard the same thing.  Though I haven't yet had the opportunity to use an H6. I've also hesrd the User
 Interface is much cleaner. 
In that price range the Tascam you suggested might be your best bet. 

What mics are you using?

 




 I've had many similar experiences on set and all I can say is it gets better. In class projects tend to be crappy. You get stuck in groups with people that have no ambition and no interest in learning any of the skills necessary to make a good film. My experience at film school was that there are two kinds of students that go there. The ones that go to class and the ones that go to set. 
You'll start to build up contacts of people you like working with at school and your projects will improve as you start to weed out the lazy kids. 
I'm not a director,  just a sound guy, but knowing who to work with is incredibly important.  

Also saw you were in Midwest and I'm in Chicago and completely agree with your analysis of Columbia College. 




 I should make the correction that screen writing students hate feedback. The profressionals know its part of the industry.   




 Both and joke and true.
The only person who hates feedback more than the sound guy is the writer.
