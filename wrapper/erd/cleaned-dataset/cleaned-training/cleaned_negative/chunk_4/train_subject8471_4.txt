 No, I don't want to watch your "selection of bonus features", i.e. COMMERCIALS.  I just want to start the freakin' movie as soon as possible so my kids can veg in front of the TV and leave me alone.

What kind of demonic marketing bot thought this was a good idea in the first place?

 The other day I was having an echocardiogram, which is basically an ultrasound of my heart.  I was looking at it and it looked like a pregnancy ultrasound:

 Well son, there used to be this awesome website called reddit, but sometimes it would go down, and I'd have to spend time with your mother ... 



















 I don't suppose anybody remembers the 1992 Republican Convention whose theme song was "The Best of Times is Now", from the gay musical La Cage Aux Folles. 




 This woman goes into a funeral home to make arrangements 
for her husband's funeral.  She tells the director that 
she wants her husband to be buried in a dark blue suit.

He asks, "Wouldn't it just be easier to bury him in the
black suit that he's wearing?"

But she insists that it must be a blue suit and gives
him a blank check to buy one.

When she comes back for the wake, she sees her husband
in the coffin and he is wearing a beautiful blue suit.
She tells the director how much she loves the suit and
asks how much it cost. He says, "Actually, it didn't
cost anything.  The funniest thing happened.  As soon
as you left, another corpse was brought in, this one
wearing a blue suit.  I noticed that they were about
the same size, and asked the other widow if she would
mind if her husband were buried in a black suit.  She
said that was fine with her. So... I switched the heads"

 [Lies I've told my 3 year old recently](http://www.mexicanpictures.com/headingeast/2008/03/lies-ive-told-my-3-year-old-re.html)

March 18, 2008

Trees talk to each other at night.

All fish are named either Lorna or Jack.

Before your eyeballs fall out from watching too much TV, they get very loose.

Tiny bears live in drain pipes.

If you are very very quiet you can hear the clouds rub against the sky.

The moon and the sun had a fight a long time ago.

Everyone knows at least one secret language.

When nobody is looking, I can fly.

We are all held together by invisible threads.

Books get lonely too.

Sadness can be eaten.

I will always be there. 




 A knight of the Table Round should be invincible,
Succeed where the less fantastic man would fail!

 "I feel a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror, and were suddenly silenced." 




 If you're surprised that our government would do this, may I suggest adding Necessary Illusions, Manufacturing Consent, and A People's History of the United States to your reading list?
