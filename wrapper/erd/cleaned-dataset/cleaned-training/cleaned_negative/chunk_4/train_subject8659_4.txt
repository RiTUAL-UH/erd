 IT depends on what operating system you're using. If its Windows 8/8.1, you can initial a full Reset from within the OS. 

If its Windows 7, the recovery console SOMETIMES appears on another monitor after reboot (as it is loading the default drivers). but this depends on the manufacturer as well as the hardware. 

Good luck! Let us know how that goes or if anything needs clarification.

Alternatively, laptop screens are surprisingly easy to replace, especially on most HP laptops.  




 Canned air is generally more effective at dislodging dust in the nooks and crannies. That being said, I have never heard of anyone causing ESD damage, but I have seen people physically drag a vacuum attachment across sensitive components and damage them.

Basically, you're fine with the vacuum, just don't whack stuff with it :P 




 I agree. Any theoretical performance increase is completely negligible. The only difference (this is purely based on my observations) is that 3.5" drives fail slightly less due to the data density not being as high. I manage many computers, both desktops and laptops, and the smaller drives seem to physically fail as well as get corruptions much more frequently that the larger drives of same capacity. Like I said, I have nothing to back that statement up other than anecdotal observations. 




 If you can get into Windows still, go here: 

C:/  Users  "UserName"  AppData

AppData is hidden, so unhide your folders if you cant find it. Now you should see three folders: Local, LocalLow, and Roaming. In each folder, there are lots of other folders and then random files. Delete all these random files that aren't in folders. A lot of them are benign, but this is the most common place for virus' to hide. 

Good luck! Let us know how it goes or if that doesn't work. 




 As others have said, you were probably touching the heatsink which should be substantially cooler than the CPU.

I would apply some thermal paste. Most thermal paste is only rated to last a few years and given that you're running a 6 year old C2D, it's probably all dried up now. RadioShack and Best Buy carry it for $10 or less and its fairly easy to apply. There are several youtube video's explaining techniques and how-to's, but q-tips and alcohol are super useful when cleaning the old paste off the CPU and the heatsink.

Additionally, you may have bumped the heatsink while messing around in the case. I did this several years ago where I SLIGHTLY popped one of the 4 heatsink lock pins and the CPU was overheating within minutes. In this scenario, I would still re-apply the thermal paste and re-attach the heatsink. (If you remove the heatsink, you kind of have to re-apply thermal paste, especially if its old and dried)

Good luck!  




 Basically... you can't :(

There are some crazy work around and occasional success stories, but its a huge pain. For $10 more you can get one on Amazon (or get a 320GB for $45)

http://www.amazon.com/120GB-Hard-Disk-Drive-Generic/dp/B004GIGA1A/ref=sr_1_13?ie=UTF8 qid=1406606362 sr=8-13 keywords=xbox+hard+drive

 




 If you're using Windows 8/8.1, File History is an awesome feature that backs up your entire Library every hour and is super easy to use. 




 What was your reason for not using the recovery partition on your laptop? 

Depending on how you formatted/partitioned, you may be able to still use the factory recovery image. If you are trying to go from 8/8.1 to 8.1 Pro, you can type in "add features" on the Start screen and then follow the prompts to enter your 8.1 Pro key. It will upgrade without requiring a full re-install.

What brand is your laptop? Most laptop brands have different tricks to get into their recovery console. 




 In an offline scenario such as a boot disk, the command would be 

sfc /scannow /offbootdir=d:\  /offwindir=d:\windows

Where d: is where Windows is installed. 

 




 I'd say 15-60 minutes,  but however long it would normally be before your computer crashes when playing games would be a more accurate time. 




 Additionally, you could purchase a simple stand-alone mic. They are cheap and often perform better that headset mics (I have the A40's and prefer a $10 desktop mic) 




 As others have stated, it sounds like a hardware, not software issue (but it still could be!) The two most likely cases are the card is bad or the card is overheating. There is also the possibility that your power supply isn't giving the card enough power or it could be a memory issue. Lets troubleshoot to try to narrow it down, shall we?

Possible Issues:

-Overheating

-Bad/Defective card

-Graphics driver issue

-Power Supply issue

~~-Memory Issue~~


1. How old is the card? It is important to note whether or not it is still under warranty. I'm going to assume it is, so we don't want to void the warranty :P

2. Pop the case open and see if the fan/heatsink area on the card is dusty. Clogged heatsink = overheating. Canned air is generally much safer than a vacuum cleaner if youi have to remove any dust.

3. If there is no dust, or you cleaned it, let's run a test to see if the card is overheating. There are several ways to go about this. I like [Furmark](http://www.geeks3d.com/20140313/furmark-1-13-0-download-gpu-burn-in-stress-test-opengl/) as it is quick, simple, and shows the temp during the test so there's no need for extra monitoring programs. Most CPU/GPU's are relatively safe up to ~100*C, but realistically going above 80*C means there's an issue. Your card in particular should be around 65*C at full throttle. Run the programs "Burn-in Test" and monitor its temps. Run the program for as long as it normally takes to crash while playing games.

4. If your card is staying nice and cool or doesn't crash during testing, that means your card itself is probably fine. Next, lets update your drivers. [This](http://support.amd.com/en-us/download/desktop?os=Windows%207%20-%2064#amd-catalyst-packages) download should get you the most up-to-date driver directly from AMD. This is a much newer driver than is listed on your cards page, so that could be the issue. Once you have the new driver loaded, restart your computer (even if it doesn't tell you to) and start playing your games!! If the issue goes away... awesome! If not, lets keep troubleshooting.

5. We will assume its not a memory issue since you ran Memtest already, and power supplies are difficult to test without a multimeter or power supply tester. This next step is kinda skeevy, but works. If you have a Best Buy, Walmart, or any other store that sells graphics cards, buy one that is preferably in the same series (R9 2XX) and play on it to see if the same thing happens. (These big box stores will let you return opened cards within their return policy.) If you do get a card in the same series as your R9 280X, it is using the same driver, so is purely testing whether your card is bad or not. 

If these don't work, post your results and we'll go from there. Good luck! 




 Try this on the Mini DisplayPort 

http://www.monoprice.com/Product?seq=1 format=2 p_id=8118 CAWELAID=1329456194 CAGPSPN=pla gclid=Cj0KEQjwrqieBRCln82Rgufz7I0BEiQAPNjAI8Ps5kvbe-WlFBG0K4t8vrLgS9i8fLyahnmuz2FnpLwaAqN78P8HAQ

That would give you your S7 screen and two monitors. The Toshiba DynaDock can also do this. 




 A couple things to try...

First, see if there's a voltage corrector. Its a little switch that you can select 120v VS 220v. If its on the 220v, but you're using a 120v socket, you'll have some issues.

Secondly, you might be short a cable! You mentioned that you plugged in the 24-pin cable and the 4-pin CPU cable. On some pictures, it looked like your motherboard might actually take an 8-pin CPU cable. Check and see if there's just one square 4-pin socked on the motherboard or if it's a rectangular 8-pin socket. If this is the case, you'll need a completely different model of PSU and it might be cheaper to get it directly from Dell as most PSU's with 8-pin CPU cables are on the higher end and more expensive. 

Good luck and let us know! 




 I agree, this sounds very much like a driver issue. It could be the driver is just corrupt or needs some TLC, or it could be that LoL and the driver aren't playing nice.

 I would uninstall and delete the driver from Device Manager as well as any Catalyst software and completely re-download the driver. If that doesn't work, try doing the same procedure with older drivers.

Good luck! Let us know how it goes! 




 I would update/re-install your**[ drivers](http://www.nvidia.com/download/driverResults.aspx/75991/en-us)** if you haven't yet. If that doesn't help it could be a hardware issue. 

If its hardware, it could be your card overheating or just going bad ,your power supply overheating or going bad, or even possibly RAM. 

First, I would heavily dust out your case, especially around the PSU, card heatsink, and CPU heatsink. You can download a monitoring program (I like **[Speccy](https://www.piriform.com/speccy/download/standard)**, but there are several) and a stress test (I like **[FurMark](http://www.ozone3d.net/benchmarks/fur/)**, but again, any is good.) and see how hot everything gets; your card is listed as 105c max operating temp, but ideally they would be around 95ish while stressing. You could also attempt to re-apply the thermal paste if it does seem that heat is an issue.

To test RAM, **[Memtest86](http://www.memtest86.com/download.htm)** works fairly well. I would start it before bed and see how its doing in the morning as it can take a while or run indefinitely. 

Your PSU can be tricky to test unless you have a multimeter or ideally a power supply tester. If your video card isnt receiving enough power when it needs it, bad stuff happens. 

Let us know if that helps of not! 




 It should work, but depends on a few things such as where you got the trial from. Some variables such as volume license keys, Upgrade vs Full keys, etc could cause compatibility issues. Worst case scenario, you'd have to re-install Windows .exe they provided. 
If you do run into an issue with it upgrade/full, let me know because there is a registry tweak to get around that. 

Good luck! 




 It seems like your computer might still think that your headphones are plugged in, or something similar. Assuming you're using a newer Win7/8/8.1 PC, try right-clicking the volume or speaker icon next to the clock and select "Playback Options". In the windows that appears, it should show you all the different device possible (On mine for example, I have HDMI, Astro Headset, Digital Output, and Digital Optical Output). In your situation, you would want to select "Speakers" and then click "Set Default" below. 

If that works, there's a good chance that your 3.5mm port is damaged, but you can always use the above steps to manually change it. Hope that helps! 




 If I recall, "doubleclick.net" is what Google uses for ad tracking. Basically, if you've every Googled something, you'll have that cookie on there. Like others have said, its harmless. 

Since it looks like you're using Chrome, you can try turning off the "tracking" setting by going to the Settings Menu (3 horizontal lines in the upper-right)  Settings  "Show Advanced Settings"  and under the Privacy section, tick the box "Send a "Do Not Track" request with your browsing traffic"

Hope that helps! 




 There is rarely a single program that is universally good at protecting you, but if a nice "toolset" is assembled, it can greatly help. All of the listed programs are free!!

**[MSE or Microsoft Security Essentials:](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5201)** This is your base level protection that hopefully catches the really bad stuff. It get shit on a lot, but it seemingly offers great protection against some pretty nasty infections. It automatically updates with Windows and almost never bothers you gives pop-ups unless if finds something. *Note* : Don't install multiple, always-on, anti-virus programs and uninstall any old ones you don't use (Kaspersky, Norton, McAfee, etc). They can "fight" with each other stop working properly.

**[Malwarebytes](https://www.malwarebytes.org/mwb-download/):** This is a scanner that you have to run. Unlike MSE, it does not offer constant scanning (in the free version), but does a great job of removing both really nasty stuff as well as annoying toolbars and adware. Pro Tip: Right-click the check-boxes on the reports page, and click "Select All". Much easier than clicking every box!


**[ADWCleaner:](https://toolslib.net/downloads/finish/1/)** This is an easy to use and quick scanner that only targets adware, toolbars, browser hacks, etc. The app is portable (doesn't have to be installed) and is updated daily.

**[AdBlock Plus:](https://adblockplus.org/en/chrome)** This is an awesome little browser add-on that is an incredible pop-up blocker as well as helps get rid of banners and ads on websites. You'll have to install it on each browser you use separately; the link will auto-detect what browser you are using.

**[CCleaner](http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner/download/standard)**: Nice tool that cleans temp files (and can do a ton of other stuff if you're feeling bold). Doesn't really remove or scan for virus's, but malware very frequently hids in temp file locations.

All that being said, if you really like subscription anti-virus (Kaspersky, McAfee, etc.) you can normally get them for**[ FREE!](http://dealnews.com/search.html?search=anti-virus)** 




 It's hard to tell exactly what needs adhering from the pictures, but have you tried double sided tape? There are industrial adhesive mounting tape and automotive tape that is incredible strong. Additionally, you could always try epoxy, but you wont ever get it off again.

Good luck! 




 Saw them last night. They were good and chilled in the crowd for the rest of the acts. 

Whoever was manning the audio board however was a total idiot. WAY too loud, woofers were distorting, and you could barely appreciate the music. I get that certain genres beg to be blasted, but this is not one of them.

Its not FLAC, but its not bad 




 My 2008 Ford Focus SES with ~90k started having trouble shifting around 30-40 mph (although I'm not sure exactly what gear 3rd or 4th would be my guess.)  From a stop, the car accelerates without issue, but maybe 30% of the time when I get to 30-40 mph, the engine revs up to about 5k RPM. I take my foot off the gas and gently push the gas again and it will normally get into gear after 1-3 attempts at "pumping" the gas. I have researched this and found "Some 2008 Focus vehicles equipped with 4F27E automatic transaxle and built on or before 1/29/2008 may experience no 3rd or 4th gear. Possible diagnostic troubles codes (DTCs) P0733 and/or P0734. The cause may be a direct clutch snap ring out of position caused by the reverse clutch wave spring." It seemed like this was only happening on almost new cars and im not getting any CEL, so I'm not sure if this would apply to my situation.

As for the vehicles history, I've owned the car for about 2 years and put about 25k on it. I have not done any transmission maintenance (I'm not even sure if that's a thing!) but I've gotten the oil changed 3 times and hit a deer a month ago ( the issue was there before though). At around 75k miles, I had terrible engine shake while idling, and the dealership replaced the engine mount. 

As far as troubleshooting and repairing myself, I'm very mechanically inclined and have no problem diving into stuff, but I have never gotten into cars, so my knowledge is very basic.

Any help, insight, or advice would be very appreciated... thank you!! 




 Ad**d**ress. 




 If you have Office 365, then yes. If you purchased Office for Mac then no.

As it has already been said, Office and Office for Mac have two separate licensing keys, hence they cannot be swapped between them. Office 365 on the other hand can be installed on PC, Mac, Android, iOS, and Windows Phone.

If you DO have Office 365, or are unsure, go to www.office.com and login (upper right corner) using your Microsoft Account (you need a Microsoft account to have O365 so if you never made one, you probably don't have it). Once logged in, click on My Account in the upper right and the page will populate all Office products associated with that account with a large green "Install" button.

If you're still unsure, what version of Office are you running? Office 365 will only be Office 2013 so if you have '03,'07,'10 then your copy is not transferable. 

Depending on how often you use Office and in what capacity, you can try using the webapps on www.Office.com. You get Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote for free and unless you're using higher level functions (macros, etc) the webapps are basically identical to the full program.

Hope that helps! 




 Those look great! I'm really curious as to what the red material you used it called and where you can find it. Also, a metal handsaw is generally known as a "hacksaw" in English.

Is he talking about himself?! HAHAHAHA 









 Not shatter, but I have literally done exactly as OP described and had "shards" or think wafers of metal come off. 




 How does this this happen? Is it a special breed or something? I'm curious to see how big the second largest rabbit is...
