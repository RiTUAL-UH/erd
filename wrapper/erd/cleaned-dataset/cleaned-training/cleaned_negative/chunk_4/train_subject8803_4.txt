 Radical Face - Welcome home, Son. When the chorus kicks in, still gives me the same, happy feeling every time i hear it. [Link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8a4iiOnzsc)  




 Really loving all the subtle things in this season so far, the zealot in the dish, the cheese throwing, the balance joking (reaper changes, super long range on nexus cannon) Just gives it that little extra! 




 Because getting laid is of course the only purpouse of playing guitar. 




 Does anyone know if the startale video where Legend is trying to become a pro player is on youtube? I cant seem to find it, really enjoyed it when they played it during a tournament. 




 do you happen to have a link to that VOD? 




 TIL op_is_sea_gm_fyi is a fellow dutchmen 




 I think Huk and Ret aren't talking about the same thing, huk complains about him getting denied to compete in both code A and WCS NA/EU while players in code S are allowed to do this, Ret is giving his opinion about koreans playing in WCS NA/EU in the first place. 2 very different things 




 basically your MMR (the hidden ranking score system blizzard uses) has to be steady in the league you want to get promoted too. What this means: when you face, and win from gold players regularly you will get promoted soon. It can be a bit random sometimes though. 




 thats pretty sweet! 




 Well as its a new game the timing aren't figured out yet. So i think you can get into diamond now with decent mechanics, i play a reactionary style most of the time. 




 So I (diamond Protoss) just started playing around a bit on the unranked ladder as Zerg (my zerg skills are bronze/silver i think). 
I got matched vs a platinum protoss player and lost quite badly.
after the match i noticed that his league symbol changed to diamond.
So after a quick chat i found out he queued for the ranked ladder, and got promoted to diamond after the match. I think this is a bit unfair. **What do you guys think?**

TL;DR: Opponent gets promoted on the back of my diamond protoss MMR, while I played offrace on the unranked ladder. Fair/unfair? 




 Amsterdam is 4 meters below sealevel, so a flood is pretty likely to happen somewhere in the future. 




 I used a build like this in WoL a lot, but it indeed does work vs 3 hatch openings in HotS.
I don't have an exact build order, but here is roughly what i do:

FFE, if you can gateway before cannon (scout no early pool)
2 gasses
gateway 100% -- cyber core.
zealot (send to watchtower/third base if you 
chronoboost in probes until cybercore is finished, after that only chrono boost cybercore
+1 att @ 100gas (chrono when you can)
stalker.
3 gates @50% cybercore
stop probe production
3/4/5 more gates
forward pylons
should be hitting around 8:30-9:00 i think.

Hope this helps! 




 Hots started out really rough, got placed in silver after beeing plat in WoL. But after laddering for a week im back, [better than ever!](http://imgur.com/NarmerN) 




 whoopsie, missed that post/sticky. Sorry! 









 Same happened to me, got placed in silver and ranked up to plat in a few days. Sad thing is i was plat already in WoL. Oh well lets aim for diamond my brotoss!
