 Sweet thanks! If you don't mind my asking, who do you buy from? I'm leaning towards onemedstore but I kinda like the discretion provided by bitcoin. 




 I think the more concerning failure rate is for the 7ft wall test 




 Eh kind of. MEPS is supposed to filter out those that are medically unable to serve. They don't really check your physical strength or anything like that there.  




 I'm planning on buying 30 to start and then I might purchase 90 if I like the stuff and that should hopefully past me through the school year at which point I'll see about getting a prescription from my doctor back home. 

The three sizes intended for envelopes are

35.5 in

5x5.5 in

11x5.5 in 




 The problem is that for several of the tests the failure rate for men is at or below 1%, whereas for women it's in the 10s or 20s. Fiscally speaking, it would be irresponsible to pursue this if half way through training a quarter of the women get dinged out. 




 I took it freshman year of high school for about six months but I remember it not doing much for me. Gave me headaches though.  




 What dude your post history involves grow advice, questions about tor, and references to smoking weed several times.  









 Bro. Double double and animal fries. 




 Yaaaaasssssss 




 The article I found said that he mostly did this over the course of his senior year so I think it's safe to assume that he was 18 for at least some of it. 




 I'm shocked!  SHOCKED I SAY! 




 OP deliver with pics 




 Younger than 16 is actually very serious and should be treated as such. We're talking about a freshman in high school. What you neglect to mention, or didn't read, is that he did this to **10 different kids**, not to the same girl ten different times, and he intended to share the films. By your own standard he's getting off easy at 2.5 years per victim.

Edit: I should add that I didn't know this guy. I graduated from SEHS this year, but the general attitude among seniors was that freshman girls are off limits. They're basically kids. Hell, some of them aren't done with puberty or have even started it for that matter.  




 Yeah I'll definitely talk to a transfer counselor to get the specifics.  I think my total GPA is still above 3.65 but I'll have to double check. If I kill this year I can raise that though.  









 So I'm currently attending SBCC (Isla Vista FTW) and I love it here but after spending some time exploring the UCSB campus I've decided that that's no longer my first choice for transferring. I'm also really enjoying my investing class so I figure I might enjoy a business related career. 

So here's the thing, I've looked through my credits and I've taken almost all of the courses required by Cal. I just need to take a 19 credit load next semester to finish up the reqs. Of all of the UC transferable courses I've  taken I've gotten mostly A's with a few B's mixed in there, but my non-UC transferable courses are mostly B's. The transfer website says that they only calculate your GPA based on your UC transferable courses. Can someone with experience in this tell me if my non-UC transferable courses are going to hurt my chances? I'm not sure if what they're saying on the website means that they totally ignore those courses or that they look at them but don't consider them as much in their final decision.  




 Like armodafinil is OTC in Canada?  




 Could you capture some low light footage tonight?  




 Weed maybe but that's because it literally grows on trees. Everything else is far more difficult to get than alcohol in my experience.  




 I'm not sure I understand your complaint. I summarized the situation and provided the relevant quote.  









 That's not disregard. Disregard would be seeing a school bus full of children go into a lake and say fuck it someone else will eventually call the cops and go on with your day. This is pure unadulterated psychopathic hatred for humanity. 




 Here's anothe awesome pond in Oregon.  It's called blue pool and you can go cliff diving there. I think it's about a 45 min drive + 5 mile hike from Eugene.

 Oct 4th I believe 




 Oh and just a reminder, the gopro hero 3's software and some if its hardware was absolutely terrible when it came out so let the camera junkies mess around with it for a few days and give feedback before you pull the trigger.  




 Comes out on October 4th so we won't know for sure until then but it's essentially a very bland gopro. Just press the top button and it'll turn on and record. Hold it and it will take time lapse shots. Records in 1080p at 60fps or 720p at 30fps and auto adjusts for light conditions. If you just need something to cover your ass in case a driver does something retarded or you want to record track days then this is a good choice. If you're looking to record fancy videos for a documentary or highlight video or whatever it will do but the GoPro hero 4 or Hero 3 will give you a broader range of recording options. 




 Why? For most division one starters on good teams football *is* a major. It leads to a job, and one that will pay more than you'll earn in a life time at that.  




  How the fuckity fuck fuck can someone get a fucking education when they spend an entire semester training and practicing to play fucking football

By putting in work. All of these kids playing div 1 football know what they're getting themselves into. Likely their varsity teams in high school had incredibly rigorous training programs. Some of them like Jonny Manziel take easy course loads because they know they'll go pro. Some of them like Colt Lyerla do that and fuck up. And some of them like Marcus Mariota, arguably the best div 1 QB right now, put in work. Marcus Mariota earned a general science degree in three years. Now he's taking a lax course load for his senior year so that he can get drafted. 

Here's a list of Oregon players from the 2019 season that were honored academically.

 Why? 




 Saying wtf doesn't have to be out of disgust. It could be a quizzical wtf. Honestly tho, how much time do you people spend on reddit if you're critiquing semi off topic posts and slight misuse of memes? 




 Polaroid also came out with a $99 action camera called the Cube.

 Honestly it depends. Girls in high school have a much easier time getting laid. If the teacher was disgusting or maybe even just average looking I'd probably be singing a different tune, but if he was a moderately attractive guy I wouldn't. I know my high school self would've jumped at a chance to geg with a teacher because I sure as shit wasn't getting any elsewhere.  




 That depends on if there's an implication of consequences for not having sex. It'd be rape for my boss to say she'll fire me if I don't fuck her, or my schools president to say she'll expel me. But if either of them just say "wanna fuck?" It's not illegal. No matter how unprofessional. If this kid had been 17 these teachers would be out of a job. Not facing jail time.  




 There are only 12 US states where they have to be 18 before it's legal for an adult to have sex with them. In the other 38 it's either 16 or 17. This is not some terrible crime that's only legal in the hick country. In most states the only thing wrong here is a lack of professionalism. 

http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ages_of_consent_in_North_America 




 16 is not a child. That's the age of consent in most states.  




 It has as much to do with the attractiveness of the perpetrators as it does the gender. If these women were hags it'd say race. If it were some bradley cooper looking motherfucker it'd say sex. Honestly though, what heterosexual sixteen year old male would turn down a three way with these two?

 What other reason is there for someone with a mobile body and sound mind to commit suicide? 




 What was irrational about my comment? The fact that modern medicine means that you can end mental suffering without suicide?  




 There is not a single person on earth that has thought about suicide, seeked help, and regretted not going through with it after the fact. Medication, therapy, whatever. There are things that work to combat depression in the modern realm of medicine. And I don't give a fuck what people say, suicide is fucking selfish. No matter how much you believe otherwise there will be somebody that is seriously affected by your suicide and you may have unknowingly sent them on the road to suicide.  




 Because they're not even facing a problem yet. It's a fucking preemptive measure. Euthenasia should be for true incurable pain and suffering. Not depression and sadness,  and definitely not expected depression and sadness. 




 There are very few reasons for which I think assisted suicide should be allowed. This, this is not one of them.

 Snowden is a narcissist and a traitor. He has been caught lying about so many things that I don't trust a word out of his mouth at this point. Oh yeah,  why would a patriot seek asylum in fucking China and Russia?  Those countries are the exact opposite of the ideals he supposedly stands for. Fuck snowden.  




 A bit about me: I currently go to SBCC and live in Isla Vista. After talking to my transfer counselor I've learned that I can probably transfer to USC and start as a sophomore in the fall of 2015 if I take certain classes this spring. USC was actually my second choice behind UCSB but I didn't get into either and I decided to TAG into UCSB rather than attend one of the four years I did get into. 


* Enough about me though, what I'm wondering is, how is the greek life at USC compared to the scene on DP here in IV? Am I going to feel let down by it after I've experienced Halloween and Deltopia? 

* Coming from a middle class family that hasn't done anything spectacular,  what are my chances of actually getting a bid from a good fraternity? (My cousin is an ATO so that could be cool).

* Does the USC campus have a college town vibe or does it feel like you're in a big city?

Thanks! 




 if you want a device to get things done, to not play with - Blackberry is what you get.

That was true like 5 or 6 years ago when the blackberry waa making the only widely produced phone that resembled a smartphone and had a full keyboard but nowadays it doesn't matter. Iphone, Galaxy,  it doesn't matter because they all have business apps, full keyboards, and ease of use. If you just want to do business then any of the major smartphones will work for you just about equally.  




 Comment graveyard turn back now 




 Uhhh guys someone should look into this guy 









 Boobs 




 I crashed my bike today and now my confidence is a bit shot.I haven't ridden regularly for about four years and I bought the bike on Thursday to get around school and I've ridden it pretty much everyday since and I've loved it! However, tonight I was going for a ride and asi pulled away from the stop sign I stood up and pedaled which threw me off balance and caused me to crash in the middle of the street. Honestly I'm lucky I was under a street light so the oncoming car saw me and stopped. I managed to get away with a few minor scrapes on my elbow and what feels like a bruised rib. My main problem is I'm embarrassed, my confidence is shot, and I'm a bit scared to go riding again. Any advice?  




 I think you mean santa barbara/isla vista

It is a crime. Public use of marijuana, much like alcohol, remains illegal in Washington. They're being dropped because of the way they were written and because he was targeting.

 There's another factor, reddits cop hate circle jerk. A picture of a police car parked in a faded handicap spot got more upvotes than this and people were calling on OP to send the picture to all of his local news outlets. It was fucking retarded. The kicker? the spot wasn't even legally considered a handicap spot anymore.  




 I'd like to be able to do what iphones can and have access to the camera without unlocking the phone so that if I give it to someone to take a picture I don't have to worry about them snooping through my stuff.

 Not everyone has the mental capacity to bring on the next stage of civilization. And we've only been in this stage for 20 or so years.  




 Yeah? And what will they do instead?  Sit around mindlessly watching TV until their unemployment runs out? 




 Get rid of needless jobs like truck driving.

I am not looking forward to that. Between the 3.5 million semi truck drivers, 233k taxi drivers, 650k+ bus drivers, and the rest of the driving jobs in the US, commercial self driving car technology is an unemployment time bomb waiting to explode. This is the one technology that I truly think needs to have sanctions placed on it for commercial use. 




 Another one here 




 That's the issue. I can't be there for him. We go to different colleges now and his new "experienced" friends came up with the idea to try edibles. I'm honestly worried about him getting that high with people stupid enough to give a first timer an edible. I gave him advice like eating a full meal beforehand? only taking a bite and giving it time to kick in, but I can just tell that this is going to go south. 




 So my friend has decided to get high for the first time, I personally don't have a problem with this. I do have a problem with his method however. For his first high ever he will be using edibles.......... I told him that this is a terrible idea and he should smoke for his first time because it'll be easier to control his intake level but he refuses and says I'm iver reacting.  




 Planned parenthood for the win 




 Where do you live..? 




 Fuck I miss oregons friendliness. It's just not the same down here in socal. 




 Mine resistant has become a buzz word for the police militarization crowd. When looking at MRAPs the key word for police is armored. If you're rolling up to an active shooter situation in a squad car you're in for a bad time. The fact of the matter is that even a .22 can penetrate every part of a car except the engine block. 

[Here is a video if a .22lr and common pistol rounds being tested on a car door](http://youtu.be/lkYBd9p3b8M). Whether it fits your agenda or not you need to admit that it's well within reason for police departments to own an armored vehicle.  




 So where are the people that launched the original story alleging police corruption to the front page less than 3 hours after it was posted? Where are the 4k+ upvotes? 




 That's just ridiculous.  Everyone knows that the Internet was invented by Bill Gates and Steve Job when they were in college.

 Those ROE went into effect in 2010. I call bullshit. 




 That's backwards retarded and completely misleading. Those rules of engagement are to some extent unique to the US, and were set by Obama. Before 2010, when the Taliban was still using gunfire as a common tactic, it was fire on people that were threats, especially in close quarters areas. Something else to think about:

http://rt.com/usa/battlefield-deaths-rules-engagement-change-862/



Now, I have friends and people that I love that are cops. If you expect me, them, or anyone they know to support them being restricted to the rules of engagement that soldiers in Afghanistan are binded to then I demand that their equipment be upgraded to afford higher levels of protection.  




 Not really. Nobody even needed to reload. They all probably just dumped a 13ish round mag which would be reasonable if they were by themselves. It takes a matter of seconds to shoot a magazine that size. They may not have realized that all of them were shooting in that time.  




 If you wamt to do that then you include all, but if you want to use at as a measurement of the probability of the success of your marriage as the guy I was replying to was, then you don't. Got it? 




 If you're going into combat with a bunch of 180lb men you should be able to carry at least one of those men on your back. The current standards for men is what the army has decided proves that you are in good enough shape to do that and anything else that gets tossed at you in a war zone. War is not about fairness. It's not about letting a 100lb feminist play dress up and pound her chest while saying she can do a man's job. If she truly wants to go to war she needs to be able to prove that she can pull her own weight and the weight of anybody that gets in a jam while they're out in that war zone.  




 Before some of yall get all confuzzled. Ranger school is not RIP/RASP, meaning it does not get you into the 75th. Ranger school is a leadership school and it gives you the Ranger TAB whereas someone in the 75th has a SCROLL.

 So I'm making my first weed purchase tomorrow and I'm wondering if I'll need a ziploc or jar or something to contain the scent once I bring it back to my dorm. The RAs have a see it, smell it, hear it policy for checking people.  














 So I've moved to a new town for college and I've been having a bit of trouble making friends and the few friends I have made are pretty straight edge. But I've always had a bit of an interest in weed so I'd like to try it for the first time. I've met a dealer but he's a bit of an asshole and definitely not someone I really want to spend much time with. 









 I'll update with pics later, but essentially there's a pink area that extends out to where the plastic surgeon did the electric cauterization and then there's a grayish area where the original mole was. I'm slightly worried that the doctor may have missed some and that it'll regrow.

Edit: kind of grainy but here are pics

 I'm still sporting the 'ole high school mop top. Never really had short hair before so I need somebody that can figure out what would look good on me.   












































 Just spotted a female, early 20s, walk onto my neighbors front deck and lean over the railing to do something, she then got back on her bikd and rode jn circles in the intersection while swearing to herself before traveling south down Washington st. 







































 So here's the deal, I've got a mole in the middle of my face and it's always bugged me and I want to get it removed before I go to college. I had an appointment with a dermatologist and they referred me to a plastic surgeon because they couldn't get the scar to flow with the natural lines of my face. The plastic surgery place was slow to get back to me and it's now a week and a half from the time I leave for college and I'm just now getting the appointment set. I originally wanted to have the procedure done here abd then have a doctor in my college town remove the stitches, but it seems like that might not even be possible at this point,  so if I had a consult here would the doctor be able to send his notes to a doctor in my college town so I could have it done right when I arrive or is that unlikely/illegal/impossible etc?

Edit:

Conversely, is it possible to have the procedure and consult done in the same appointment?  




 I was helmet shopping and the store owner was hard selling me a high viz kabuto kamui. The price is around $250 and it seems like a decent helmet. It's got the eye glasses insert port things, a drop down sun visor, an antifog insert, and a quick clip chin strap thing. 

Apparently the company is new to the US so the products are being sold more cheaply than they normally would. The guy at the store basically said that they're only a step below Shoei.

Is that true? If it is then it seems like a pretty good deal but I'm not sure.  




 A couple weeks ago I overhead a conversation at the DMV but it's just now dawning on me how amazing this guy is.

 So I arrived at the DMV and took my number. Usual DMV shit. I've got like a 90 minute wait time. I go take a seat and end up eavesdropping on a conversation that's happening behind me. It's this 20 something black kid talking to a 40 something Hispanic dude with a fairly thick accent. They're shooting the shit and doing the normal small talk thing and the hispanic guy gets around to asking the kid what he does. The kid says that he usually works construction but hasn't been able to find a job lately. They talk a bit about construction and then the hispanic guy tells the kid how to apply for a job at McDonald's and how it's a great place and whatnot. At this point I'm sorta rolling my eyes and thinking what the fuck is this guy talking about. The kid says he's applied everywhere and no one is hiring. The hispanic guy says to apply to a specific McDonald's location and that he can get the kid some hours. At this point the kid asks how he can do that and the hispanic guy replies that he's the owner of that location. The kid asks how that came to be and the hispanic guy says that his family immigrated to California ehen he was about 10. During high school he knocked up his girlfriend and took a job at McDonald's to pay all the bills. He worked at McDonald's for 20 years before he was promoted to manager and after 5 more years he had saved up enough money to purchase a franchise location. 


I'm blown away. I look at my life and myself and I know I couldn't do that. I couldn't work at a fast food restaurant for 20 years to support my family. That man is a better man than me and he's only ever worked at fucking McDonald's.  









 So I picked up a high viz kabuto kamui today for $250 and now I'm off to check out bikes. The guy said that it's one of the better helmets in the price range, which I believe. He also said that it's of Shoei quality but since it's new to the US it's not as pricey yet. Not sure how true that is, but I'm happy with my purchase!  




 So the basic strength test is that you need to lift a stretcher loaded w/ a 150lb person with help. That's easy enough with deadlift training but I was talking to some EMTs and some people over in /r/ems and they said that deadlifts are all fine and good, but more often than not you're not going to have time or room to use proper DL form and I'll be carrying the stretcher in awkward positions on stairwells and stuff. So that said, I'm doing Coolcicada's PPL right now, but I want some suggestions for a workout that will strengthen all the little muscles in my back so I don't snap it if I'm lifting a 210lb dude from a weird position.  




 I just moved to town and I'm looking for a place to gamble. Primarily hold 'em and blackjack. How is the gambling there? Are they fair (or at least as fair as you expect a casino to be) or is it kind of shady? 




 I'm looking for a place with a large selection, particularly of helmets, but most of the places in the area seem to be smaller gear stores attached to bike dealers. I know I can order from revzilla but I prefer buying helmets in person 




 So I'm in a car doing 45 on a four lane road and I've got a car in front of me, a motorcyclist slightly behind in the lane next to me and a car in front of the motorcyclist. This van is coming up behind me doing 55-60 and the car in front of me decides to slow down to turn right. Well, the van doesn't see us slowing until the last second so to avoid rear ending me he swerves into the left lane still going ~55. The motorcyclist somehow sees him at the last second and guns it while swerving into the space in front of me.

If that motorcycle didn't have that reaction time I would be telling a different story. Stay safe out there. 







































 I did everything you're supposed to do. I showered after every workout. I changed clothes after workouts. I dried my shit off after every shower. But one day I fucked up. It was a particularly hot day (95ish F) and I did my usual mid day cardio workout. I was in a rush so I skipped my post workout shower and went straight to my next location. I then went to my afternoon weightlifting sesh and ran into my buddy. We got to talking and I ran out of time so I skipped the shower again. The next day I pop in the shower and **HOLY MOTHER OF JESUS WHAT THE FUCK.** My left thigh and the left side of my balls were burning like a mother fucker. Now I've gotta spend 2-4 weeks using antifungal cream on my junk before my shit stops burning or I can have sex that isn't painful and embarrassing. 


Be careful ladies (yes you too) and gentlemen. This stuff sucks.
