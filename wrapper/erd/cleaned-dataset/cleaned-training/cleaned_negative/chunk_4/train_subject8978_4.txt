 Superb. I'm not a huge Fishbone fan but this is a great song and a great performance.
 




 Sadly, I think you're right, things are going to have to get worse before they get better. 'They' will fight and the fight will be ugly, but that's the only way things will, eventually, get better. How many more men will have to be destroyed by family "law" before we, collectively, wake up? Not sure, but marriage is certainly taking a serious hit and the more men that opt out the better

 It occurs to me that the (disputed) Gandhi quote: "First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win." is very much applicable to the Men's Rights movement. Twenty years ago, the men's rights movement basically didn't even exist, or existed in a very small, marginalized form. Today, it seems as though we're transitioning from the "laugh at you" to the "fight you" stages. Make no mistake, it's still a marginalized movement, but it is a recognized movement that feminists now feel the need to fight (i.e. Warren Farrell at U of T). There are more people every day who are realizing that the current feminist-dominated culture simply isn't working. Let's keep it up.
 




 Is it just me, or does that picture from 1999 say it all? Fraser's face is all "Please help." and her's is "I'm gonna take this motherfucker for every dime he's worth."

Watch the first ten minutes, up until Chow Yun Fat spits out his toothpick.


 




 If you like that, check out Trinity and Beyond: The Atomic Bomb Movie. A history of nuclear testing, with stunning footage, a superb soundtrack and narrated by Shatner!

Truly awesome movie.
 









 Shoah.

Ten hour documentary about the holocaust with no historical footage, mostly interviews with survivors. Incredibly difficult to watch, but essential.
 




 Oh man, this is a very difficult movie to watch. Really don't think I'd want to go through this twice, but it is a masterpiece.
 




 He did it last Thursday:

 Richard Wolff helps explain the situation:

 ....and will find that after a thorough and exhaustive re-examination of all the facts, that they were completely and totally right in the first place.

 




 Because oil.
 




 "Slavery with a chance of medical care." Good one!
 




 Actually, the manliest thing he ever did was work with the brilliant but psychotic Klaus Kinski...more than once!
 




 Google: Self-driving cars in 3-5 years.


Feds: Yeah, sure, totally...as soon as we work out a scheme of kick-backs, illegal campaign donations and tax schemes so we can get what's ours.

 1971 Dodge Challenger from [Vanishing Point](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA4ymmXa8rs). 




 Tarantino's scripts are fantastic, and always worth checking out if you like his films. Check out the script for Django Unchained and Kill Bill, esp. I think they would've been better movies (especially the ending in Django) if he had stuck to his scripts more closely.
 




 I can quit anytime I want.
 




 Quite the contrary. You're going to see how feminist theory influences Family Law first-hand. I worked at a state AG office for two years, it was a real eye-opener as to how feminist theory dominates public policy.
 




 Don't even get me started on The Black Eyed Peas.... 




 Logic...critical thinking...rational decision making...game theory....identifying logical fallacies....I apply lots of the philosophy I learned every single day.

 My two favorite shots are both from the same movie and come immediately after each other. Kagemusha goes immediately from [this shot](http://www.ropeofsilicon.com/Images/stories/2009/may/kagemusha1.jpg) to [this shot](http://www.ropeofsilicon.com/Images/stories/2009/may/kagemusha2.jpg). Fucking beautiful. 




 Hands down, my favorite performance of all time is Eli Wallach as Tuco in The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. As a performance, it is simply magic to watch. The character is so well-realized it's easy to forget that there's even an actor there, all you see is the character. I will never get tired of him or this movie.

 "Is it worth learning about Nietzsche at some point in my life? "

It's worth learning about Nietzsche at some point in everyone's life. Seriously, one of the most important, and one of the most entertaining philosophers ever. Do it, you won't regret it.
 




 Ha, true about both sides of his personality. I heard about it from When We Were Kings where Plimpton talks about trying to get it into the GBOWR as the shortest poem ever, and it seemed that in the context, in front of a crowd, it was more a "we" thing. Whatever, good job with the design! 




 Awesome design....but pretty positive it's "Me, We" as in we're all part of the same human family instead of "Whee!" which is a little too silly for the greatest of all time! 




 It's not what you did, it's how you did it.

 Dude, my apartment building burned to the ground last August. Lost everything except the clothes on my back and my wallet. I feel for you. Good luck.

 God, tigers are so stupid!
 




 Always interesting to see Warren Farrel. Unfortunately the host of this show, Michael Coren, is basically a right-wing Christian dick, which is why he's on Sun News. 




 Thanks for the offer!
 




 Further proof, Lennon does the same thing to Zappa:

 Don't know anything he did other than Transmet. What are some other good Ellis books?
 




 The Fall.

Currently have 17 albums with 4 star ratings or higher on Allmusic.
 




 Funny, I have the same attitude towards Transmet. If you're a fan of Hunter S. Thompson at all, it comes across as a truly shitty comic book version of that man's much more interesting books/life. 





































































































































































































































 With no preparation, you go back immediately with only the information about the event that's currently in your head. This is pre-9/11 so nobody is really going to take this threat seriously, how would you play it? 










































































































































































































































































































































































































 ...be defenseless in the face of one of the most cruel beasts that has ever taken a people into captivity. That's this American white man. And they have proved it throughout the country by the police dogs and the police clubs. A hundred years ago they used to put on a white sheet and use a bloodhound against Negroes. Today they've taken off the white sheet and put on police uniforms, they've traded in the bloodhounds for police dogs, and they're still doing the same thing. And just as Uncle Tom, back during slavery, used to keep the Negroes from resisting the bloodhound, or resisting the Ku Klux Klan, by teaching them to love their enemy, or pray for those who use them spitefully, today Martin Luther King is just a 20th century or modern Uncle Tom, or a religious Uncle Tom, who is doing the same thing today, to keep Negroes defenseless in the face of an attack, that Uncle Tom did on the plantation to keep those Negroes defenseless in the face of the attacks of the Klan in that day."
