 This is the nature of the game and sports. Some of the best players of the 90's made less in their entire careers compared to average players of the 2000s. 




 If Romney decided to come back in, would he be a big favorite? 




 Good for her! Women will vote for Hillary for the same reason Barack Obama got almost all of the black vote. She's one of them. I'm not saying it's logical, but it's how people think. 




 Does it seem like teams are overpaying players just so they can lock them up and not pay them when the new CBA takes effect? 




 because certain people were raised to be prejudiced and not like brown or black people 




 People like to vote for people who look and sound like them.  














 Not that bad? Just the wars and disastrous tax cuts that lead to a near depression economy make him horrible to me. And there is so much more too.  




 Why doesn't he tell ownership if you don't pay me now I refuse to sign with you ever again? I'm only playing to keep my stock up and sign with another team when the time comes. 




 will Aaron Rodgers be there? 




 What did you expect signing all those AARP expendables?  




 if biden announced though he'd be second :/  




 LeBron won't like this 




 I'm sure fox execs are yelling, get those damn interns to find something! read them again!  




 Bush is known for his endless wars, tax cut for the rich, and destroying the economy. Obama got a lot accomplished and has a strong resume in the history books! 









 That's kinda cool! will you be like matt damon in elysium or borg in star trek now?  









 Interim title fight over regular title fight? really?  



















 Steroids will now be allowed as long as you don't inject during the match. Half time is ok.  




 I think it's more of the banks and corporate puppeteers than Hillary per se 














 who is the main event now??? 









 This should be obvious to everyone. I don't even think he's that racist. I think he's pandering to the voters in the party. 




 she's supporting hillary now and doing her dirty work 




 We just need enough of them not to, but I know you're right. 




 Until she starts up again. Give it time. There is a lot of time between now and the primary election. She deserves criticism. She came out of nowhere to attack Sanders. Not his positions, not his policies, but the man. Why did she do this? Who is she working for? 



















 So, what about the issues? what about substance? Oh right, it's easier to just attack a source and not talk about those things like claire mccaskill. 




 oh yeah? people in western europe struggling to escape? like germans want to run away from their universal healthcare and free university education?  




 why don't you worry more about content than sources? there is no desperation, it's a hail marry to begin with  



















 Why are you making an ad hominem attack? Why don't you just address the content? Some politicians are more in touch with people than others. Reliability is a fair issue. 




 Voting record bruh. I'm good.  




 She's not that liberal. She is a corporate democrat. She is a warhawk. She has a voting record. Are you familiar with it? Her backers are banks. She voted  for the war. And they are not lies or smears. They simply asked people who they thought the mansions belonged to.  




 We can and we should. We don't because Wall Street owns all of the republicans and half of the democrats, those like Hillary Clinton, Claire McCaskill, everyone who voted for the trade deal, and the President himself.  




 You mean Hillary Clinton's campaign donors? 




 To me Hillary is no different than republicans. She's a corporately owned and a warhawk. Sometimes conservatives are right about issues and in their criticisms.  




 I think it's important to consider material based on the content rather than making an ad hominem judgment. Wall Street is paying for her campaign.  




 No, of course not, just like I would not vote for someone only based on their sex. But it raises important questions. Can she relate to me? Where did she get all that money? IMO no she can't and she got that money from her Wall Street friends who pay her millions of dollars every year for speeches and are paying for her campaign.  




 Because they concentrate their wealth at the cost of everyone else. Us "wingers", what does that mean again? Well, anyway, we believe in equality, social mobility and the [American Dream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acLW1vFO-2Q).  



















 All the revenue streams you listed will not be realized by a majority of fighters.  




 We need to catch and surpass Hillary Clinton's 990k. 




 exactly! i wish someone with skills would do some Sanders Dragon Ball Z animations  




 they obviously spent the minimum money on this project and don't care at all about the fighters

they're robbing them and insulting them 




 It's indicative of Reebok's leadership. Any competent company would have oversight and checks.  









 she's not going to be a VP 














 He talks about it more in the actual 60miutes story, but I can't seem to find it. He basically said they have horrible leadership, a bunch of clowns working for them. I think UFC's kits are further evidence of that. 




 They're a horrible corporation on the decline. Listen to what the [Crossfit owner said about Reebok](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKnMQKU_-b8).  




 are we doing a betting pool? i'm going to say 12,000 




 what if it's larger than 9,500? 




 crossfit is ditching reebok once their contract is up

the owner hates reebok 




 that sounds about right 
























 This is telling of the quality of Reebok. Crossfit will leave them when their contract is up. Reebok is a garbage brand and they have some of the worst higher ups in the clothing business.  




 I wish. I can't afford that either. If only there was a free event.  




 I can buy 4 of the pride shirts or one ugly Reebok shirt? It's not really a choice. 




 it is possible they'd have to pay WWE if they used CM Punk? 




 i was trying to be funny 




 they own his likeness, i'm sure they knows they'll be using his name long after he's dead  




 ;) 




 female presenter gets [roasted](https://twitter.com/theMMAcommunity/status/615897111754768384) 




 this guy [sums it up](https://twitter.com/acmalin927/status/615898673658986496), the uniforms take away individuality  




 there is a [Georges](https://twitter.com/fishisoff/status/615898902256947200/photo/1) top too 









 very lol 




 was there even one fighter who looked genuinely happy?  




 That design could have been thrown together in under an hour. I would never wear Reebok's ugly clothes.  




 this kit was disappointing  




 that smacking noise he's making with his mouth is very annoying 




 happens sometimes 




 typical UFC

the problematic start is symbolic of their fight kit and the reebok deal 




 You're right. He doesn't have to reach all of them. Just enough of them at the right times. 









 The USA is not the UK. And Labour is much further to the left than Sanders. 




 fox news will spin this and say we have to begin bombing Iran ASAP 




 they got citizens united and still get to execute people, you can't win em all bad guys!  




 If only there was protection. We need to protect American jobs. We can have a strong economy if people make livable wages, like in all of those well paying manufacturing jobs that have been shipped overseas   Americans should not have to compete with slave labor.  





























 let's see if he can it up with the new testing policy, his cycling windows might have to get larger, but jacksons is good at what they do 




 This isn't new. This is what she does. People know what she is before training with her. And her fighters never break down mentally in a fight. 




 are these kits like a big chunk of the supposed pay ufc fighters are getting? do they get some coupons or vouchers for meals at the soup kitchens too? 




 beer goggles bruh

and that voice! omg, I want to be Matt Hamill 




 as it should be, champs can't miss weight, none of this Paulo Filho BS 




 If the Dems can win the next two presidential elections there is a very good chance the court could be drastically reshaped to be progressive 6-3. 




 Say the Rebels win. What are the chances they turn on Irael in a decade or two? 




 How do NATO allies feel about this?  




 great video! 














 If the average American can what? 

Get rid of the cap on social security taxes. This does not affect the average American at all. If you expand medicare it will bring costs down. Those are the primary social costs. 

And take it easy on defense spending, corporate welfare, and tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires. And stop the banks for gouging everyone.  




 That's dishonest, so republican style for sure. 

But it wasn't socialism that ruined Greece. It was Greece that ruined Greece. A country can function only so long when people retire young, nobody pays taxes, and everyone wants services. 

Western Europe shows us what democatic socialism is.  




 **Boxing**. Heavyweight champion of the world! **Klitschko vs James**

He has great footwork, balance, height, and reach.  




 or vice versa?  




 i bet he  could practice for a few months and play on any team 




 what particularly? granted, he's very fast, but he's too big to be running sub 10second 100's or sub 20 second 200's 




 Imagine Megatron but even bigger. LeBron is crazy fast too! 

 




 there are many people whose parents lose it 




 you want the 2nd pick for a first rounder next year?  




 he's 11 to 1 so you're wrong :) 




 Barack campaigned as a progressive. He ended up governing as a center of right moderate. He didn't even try to get the public option. Somehow he's called a socialist by the right who more insane every day with the tea party. The Jewish guy who is a socialist democrat is the only honest candidate. He puts American workers first. He doesn't have corporations and the banking industry backing him like Hillary Clinton. 

I think you're making a good choice.  




 there's like a 2% chance of that happening
 




 thank you, you were right 




 He should not take VP if offered. Why would anyone want to be her VP? We all know Bill will have more power than the VP. Also, Bernie does great work in the senate.  




 Muslim? Since when? And gay? Did you see some polling somewhere that you would care to share with me? 

Personally, I'd like to see an atheist become president but i'm not holding my breath. 




 he panders to racists and is now #2 for the GOP 




 and free speech is something the government can't hinder, as far as the company you work for? oh yeah 




 It's not rehosted. Rings of fire does the program.  




 and he has decent feet! dirk 2.0 









 Kristaps Porzingis 




 The answer is not that simple. The race is dynamic and there are many factors we have to consider. I'm sure it will depend on each particular state. 




 can't reach more catholics if people are drowning and dying off
