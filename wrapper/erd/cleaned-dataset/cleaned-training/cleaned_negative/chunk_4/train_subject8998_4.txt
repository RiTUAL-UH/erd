 I guess it's all a matter of body theory and personal identity theory. I think Hawkings is Hawkings. He has his own mind; he just happens to be placed in a non-functioning body. It ultimately asks the question: Is Hawkings famous for his discoveries or disabilities?  




 ehh that's arguable. Computers have taken over the extent of which he can communicate in society, but haven't taken him over personally. 









 Just anything that makes you feel.  




 I'm looking for songs with a lot of emotion? Just raw, honest, weird stuff with deep lyrics and raw emotion. Any suggestions.
