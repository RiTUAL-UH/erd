 That's a pretty cool Heat map 




 One big answer?  Pages and pages of codes, regulations and laws, all using the English system.  They are unlikely to be changed because converting these values into metric is messy.  "This building code requires 2.74 meter high ceilings, and the stairs must each be 16 cm tall." or "Companies are allowed to dump, 30,564 liters of sewage into the neighboring stream."  There is a massive amount of regulation that needs to be taken into account.

Also there are dangers involved with changing the units people are familiar with. Imagine the height limit signs on bridges that prevent trucks who are too large from hitting the bridge. Mistakes would constantly be made during the transition period. It's just not worth it. 

The truth is, the metric system has replaced everything that matters. We use milligrams for our medication and most scientific research uses metric. NASA sure does. How we measure our drinks and weights really don't matter in the scheme of things, so we don't use metric. Metric's advantage is not important enough to replace the small stuff.
