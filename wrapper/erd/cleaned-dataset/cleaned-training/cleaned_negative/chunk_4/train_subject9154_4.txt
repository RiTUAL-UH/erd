 Well the problem is I don't have this issue with ZombiU or any other game on Wii U 




 It just seems kind of crappy that we lost team points in ranked when someone DCs. You can't win a 3v4, I've never seen it. It's very rare. 

It's about 4 out of 10 games this happens.

It's only with Splatoon I have this issue.  




 414,706 

Even from your picture I don't see it. I'm not sure what you're referring to Maniac.

My username is Bucky if that's what you're referring to but I have never said Bucky after a count.

 I've noticed you just bounce off them if you try to roll on top of them, so I don't use the weapon anymore. It's fast, but not a good weapon.

 Does anyone have constant problem with connection? My connection is fine, it works great and I never have any problems but about 35-40% of my matches someone always has a disconnect problem and it starts us with 3 people so it's 3v4 and then we lose terribly. Or it happens to the other team, same thing with ranked games. 

Wondering if anyone else has problems in games like this. 

Do you think they will at some point fix it so when someone disconnects your team won't be penalized?

 This is why you need official anal beads. They have a string.  




 there is no dom/sub in our relationship we are vers 




  It clearly means that they are intolerant to "ANY" opinion that is different then their own.

No it doesn't.  




 That's certainly one way to interpret that definition.  




 It doesn't have to be all. They do fit the description. Those are actions, things that are intolerant. You can disagree and that's fine for you to have that opinion, but I do not agree with it. 

I never said someone that is racist is intolerant to all different opinions.  




 no. you can unlock everything in a week basically. Even the stuff on single player  "hero mode." 

It's a great game except there's only two types of games to play. Splat zone- ranked or turf war. That's it. You can't do turf war on ranked, and you can only play with friends on regular games and you may not be on their team because it is randomized. 

They have a wide variety of weapons and armor/clothing to wear, but only 8-9 maps and you can only play 2 every 4-8 hours until they change them. Every time you open the game the splat sisters talk and you have to scroll through their repetitive talking every time they change courses, which is fine a couple days- then it gets annoying and you can't skip it. 

The upsides are that it is seemingly a fun game. However, they are 4v4 matches so if someone loses internet and it's 3 v 4 you will assuredly get your butt kicked.  




 Nope. But I find this satire poking fun at the week's events to be amusing.  




 it's a joke. stop trying to analyze it.  




 ....k but they have no soul 




 I usually only call someone a bigot when they refer to black people as dirty n-word, say gay marriage is the same as pedophilia, or says "President N-Word" - This is what I imagine is a bigot.  




 Nah

 I can't speak for someone I do not know. Mirroring your behavior is a common counseling technique though, such as what you say, we call it re-framing or summarizing. Might be different than what you are describing. 

I can't speak for a counselor who I do not know but if you felt like she was coming on to you, then I am sorry. That should not happen in our profession. It's in our ethical codes and standards that we not have dual relationships like that. It's harmful to the client. And most importantly our job is to advocate for our client. So I can see how that experience may have not helped you any. Not all counselors are like that, if she was indeed doing that, again I can't speak for a situation I had no part in. 

I can't speak to her mannerisms or the way she counsels, maybe that's just the things she does? With her hair, lip licking, mirroring, necklace touching...I really don't know. 

It's not unheard of for a counselor to check up on a client once they have terminated their sessions. She could have generally been concerned, again I do not know. 

I always tell clients that they can tell me anything, so if they had an attraction to me and told me. I would thank them for telling me, I would go over the part in the ethical standards with them and then I would refer them to another counselor. At that point, the relationship would have been damaged. It really depends how severe it was. But it would make the relationship a bit awkward. It's not a rejection so much as doing the right thing for them. There are some situations where an attraction cannot be avoided like for a school counselor if they have a student who is attracted to them. They can't refer them to someone else. So it has to be maintained appropriately. But those are younger kids who are malleable and easier to work with I think. 

Likewise, I also see a therapist and if I were attracted to her, I couldn't see her.
