 I just found out at 22 I was the child not of my father, but instead of my mother and a sperm donor who had Croatian citizenship at the time (the procedure took place in New Orleans in the early 90s if it matters). 

I automatically had American citizenship at birth by being born of an American and by being born in America, but now that I suspect I could get Croatian citizenship I am very interested in acquiring it. 

The Croatian bills regulating it suggest you need to settle the matter before you are 18, yet I did not know of my true origin. 

Also of note, I am not sure if he fled as a refugee in the 1990s, and I know a lot of the laws are different and written with the aim of resolving stateless citizens, so I am not sure if I could inherit citizenship if he was fleeing refugee wise. 

I should have access to proof of my origin via the fertility clinic, so is there a possibility of getting citizenship?  

I will link the relevant text of the Croatian legal code. 

The gentleman in question likely signed away the kinds of rights in regard to actions such as child support or whatnot, but I doubt that still includes the ability to confer citizenship. Is that the case?

I am older than 18 and not on the register of Croatian citizens, so I have no idea what to do and I presume this will involve a fair amount of paperwork even if I find all of the documentation. 

Thanks in advance.

 In terms of their governments. Like did they have cooperative foreign policy as little statelets or what?  Both were short lived in the long term, but did they have something like camaraderie as very small states who wanted independence from their southern neighbor?


Edit: especially in regard to race and the griqua being another force not necessarily subservient to the cape
