 If this is true, can we please stop getting pissy about the guy driving a Hummer? 




 That's the interesting point.

If you didn't have a dick, you're okay, because you are a beautiful woman.

If you had a black dick, you would be okay because you were an oppressed black person.

If you didn't acknowledge or like the fact that you have a dick, then you're okay because you are a special transgender who just wants to be free.

But if you have and enjoy your white dick, then fuck you. 




 It's like a swizzle stick!

 Well, the world is ending, Kanye admitted he was wrong. 









 I don't quite understand the issue with /r/Art 

What makes art... art?

Is it the subject material? Does a drawing have to have a deeper meaning before it becomes art?

Is it originality? Does it need to be completely original and have no  prior inspiration?

Is it the medium? Does canvas and paint have more right to be called "art" than crayon and construction paper?

Because [Jackson Pollock](http://www.internetmonk.com/wp-content/uploads/pollock.number-8.jpg), [Andy Worhol](http://www.warhol.org/exhibitions/2012/15minuteseternal/en/img/art-marilyn-470x469.jpg), and [Pablo Picasso](http://metacool.typepad.com/metacool/images/11048740ll.jpg) would beg to differ.

She gets the advice on how to make simple syrup, thanks them, and laments that she is also out of syrup.

 Hang on...

Question 1 - How "new" is your friend?

Is this someone you've known for a few months from work, but don't have any newer friends than them?

Or is it someone that you met within the past few weeks?

Question 2 - How are they selling the car?

If they are selling to a guy on Craigslist, do they have a way of trusting the transaction?

Question 3 - Why can they not cash or deposit the check themselves?

Even if they don't have a bank account, most banks will allow an account to be opened with an initial check deposit. There is little reason to take a check for someone else.

If you can not answer those questions satisfactorily, or if the answers make you uncomfortable, *do not perform the transaction*.

 His first scenes included him literally whining about going with his friends to get some power converters (probably for his landspeeder) to Uncle Owen. 




 The one by Admiral Ackbar was perfect. 




 Well, yes. I take issue with it. That is part of having an opinion.

If it is insane to have an opinion, even a *wrong* opinion (which is your opinion), then lock me up in a padded cell.

**WARNING - My Opinion**

Tidal *can* offer whatever terms it wants, but ultimately they are the weaker service when it comes to the one metric that matters... The number of subscribers.

If Tidal were to be *smart* about it, they would say that musicians should have *some* exclusivity with Tidal, instead of trying to strongarm them into full exclusivity. And strongarm it is, since they try to make all the **small** artists exclusive, but the **big names** can choose to go to other services.

For example... [Kanye West](https://play.spotify.com/user/xpoplicola/playlist/77fa6y3frmLh2Jn2J3d6Xn), [Jay-Z](https://play.spotify.com/artist/3nFkdlSjzX9mRTtwJOzDYB), [Daft Punk](https://play.spotify.com/artist/4tZwfgrHOc3mvqYlEYSvVi)... All still on Spotify, but if I make a song, and I want it on Tidal, I have to sign an exclusivity contract.

Is that fair? 




 Because if you want widespread acceptance, you should have widespread availability. 

Why would I deny my stuff on massive, wildly popular services in favor of an inferior one with less users? 




 The big thing that I can think of to do is to reevaluate the construction when you come up against a plot point you didn't plan for.

For example, you make a grand battle between good and evil where the protagonist takes on the Big Bad singlehandedly. But while writing, you realize that the plucky best friend is just the type of person to stand with the hero.

You write the section with that change, and then rework the plan to include it. 




 Fair enough.  




 Well, regarding the forking issue, it isn't that the timelines didn't branch out, it's that there are no games on those branches. 




 Okay... so you are saying that Inception stole dream-within-a-dream and dream-diving from Final Fantasy 8?

I'm sorry, but this is less a theory and more a fanfiction.

First, there is no discrepancy solely contained in Disc 1, unless you accept this to be true from the start. And the only weirdness is the shared vision on the train.

Quistis hit on Squall early on because they are roughly the same age, and he is single and attractive.

Everything else here can't be disproven, the same way you can't disprove that I saw a dragon last night.

Ultimately, this is just an attempt at shoehorning an unrelated movie into a game.  




 Basically stated, the theory is that Squall died during the attack on Sorceress Edea, and that everything that happened afterward, including the craziness of the school being an alien spacecraft, is his own delusion as he comes to grips with death. 




 That isn't caused as much by surface tension, as it is by water pressure.

By thrashing about, you unsteady the body, but you also lower the amount of water directly beneath you.

This causes less upward pressure on your body from the higher-density water and causes/allows you to sink. Adding in the effect of your thrashing causing water to move around you, and your head easily goes underwater. 




 They actually have a full timeline out, that shows three separate timelines based on whether Link survived or when Ganon was killed.  




 The only one that hints to Assassins being real is the Abstergo employees.

The rest is easily explainable as them playing Assassin's Creed on the Playstation in the game. 




 Great work, but when I saw "beer goggles" as the name, I was expecting the subjects to be looking better inside the beer glass. 




 However, the use of certain elements indicated that they were certainly *implying* that Return to Oz was a direct sequel to The Wizard of Oz. Most specifically, the Ruby Slippers which were created solely for the MGM film (to show off the Technicolor), which in the books were silver. 




 And the Wheelers... 




 -rel rhymes with -rel... Thus quarrel rhymes with barrel. 




 Throwing away other people's belongings is not the same as coloring outside the lines.

What *you say you did* was a crime. 




 You are being downvoted because you are saying that you literally destroyed a piece of history. Plus, it wasn't yours to destroy.

No matter how abhorrent that was, it needed to survive for the simple purpose of understanding the times.

Should I throw away someone else's copy of the Bible, or go into Barnes and Noble and tear up copies of Fifty Shades of Grey?

Maybe the book didn't belong in the school library. Maybe the book isn't appropriate for most contexts. But you absolutely do not destroy a book. 




 My grandfather has (maybe had, I don't know if he kept it) a copy of this on VHS.

His whole basement den was lined with DVD cases. 




 It's. 




 They're *all* just ways of capitalizing on the franchise...

The fact is, they shouldn't *be* a franchise in the first place.

Why do we need sequels to Beauty and the Beast, Lion King, Cinderella, Snow White, Peter Pan, or Air Bud?

The sad part is that the movies that had *room* for a sequel don't get one, like Sword in the Stone. 




  The Lion King II being the best

 better Disney sequels

Yeah, being the most impressive turd in the outhouse isn't a great accomplishment. 




 What /u/PainMatrix said, plus Kane was motherfucking rich. 




 They should call that award the "Dead Horse Award" 




 Thank you. I was never a soap fan. 




 Yeah. Dude blocked you.

If you're actually friends with the guy, call him up and tell him, so he can unblock you.

If you're not, then just get over it. 




 The book series was basically, "what if Game of Thrones had a smidgen less killing?" 




 I've read that one!

It was one of the Sword of Truth novels, Temple of the Winds.

Kahlan and Richard are taken into separate tents and told they have to consummate their marriages to other people (even though they love each other only. It's a magic thing.).

However, Richard was swapped with the other guy, because of shenanigans and since they weren't allowed to say anything Kahlan didn't know.

They bone, which to her felt like she was being violated, no matter how well Richard treated her, then she realized that for the magic to work she had to enjoy herself.

So she goes a second time, being more forceful, with Richard knowing that she thinks he is the other guy. She cums like their is no tomorrow, and then "surprise! You just raped your husband!" 




 The easier VR twist is having VR be an answer to something.

Like on Family Guy, where Brian uses VR to spend time with Pearl before she dies. 




 A lot of them sound like good episodes of The Twilight Zone...

The twist ending where the doctors are revealed to be ugly pig faced people, and the "hideously mutilated" woman is hot... 




 Cask of Amontillado, Count of Monte Cristo, Wizard's First Rule, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban... 




 You will note that many points on the list apply to Fantasy, primarily 10a and 15.

11 is used in Fantasy settings just as easily... even in Science Fiction it is used to explore good and evil (Dr. Jekyll, Invisible Man) but it can be applied with magic as well (Snow White's Evil Queen) 




 I rather like the idea of 10a, someone calls tech support for magic. 




 Enhanced interrogation isn't the point of the "rule" or the comment.

It's about punishment. The idea that we would agree to take rapists, mass murderers, baby killers, and (ultimately because we need it for the story) over muscled political dissodents, and have them be publically hunted for sport is... a little far fetched.

Especially when today we live in a society that give Charles Manson a token parole hearing. It would take a *lot* of changes, not limited to the complete repealing of the Constitution.  




 With rich people wanting to dominate a woman. 




 Having one chapter where the character goes through their dreams, and that is used as a means for them to remember something forgotten or turns out to be a vision is fine. 




 Wizard of Oz fits better with the dream issue.

And Dynasty (I think that was the soap opera that retconned an entire season as a dream.)

And St. Elsewhere, where the whole show was in the imagination of an autistic child.  




 Just remember that many great works are on this list.

/11. Scientist experiments on himself - The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, etc.

/13b. Author ignores basic human decency and the Constitution in creating a strange punishment system. - The Running Man.

/2a. Writer has writer's block. - Secret Window...

/14. White man gets wisdom from magic Native. - Avatar

If your story is *good* (doesn't even have to be great), then this list doesn't matter. 




 Exactly, who knows... But I'll tell you this, changing the name of a superhero rarely is a good thing.

Look at The Greatest American Hero. 




 It is a very cruel fate to be taken as a boy and given the power, and responsibilities, of a god.

Look at all the boy heroes out there. They mostly turn out "okay" (Tim Drake), but they are damaged goods, the lot of them.

Their friends are mostly people they fight alongside, their family are targets. Most of them end up hiding their identities to protect the ones they love. If they are lucky, their human friends don't turn into supervillains.

I'm not saying "superhero is the worst thing ever", but if you are saddled with that burden and given superspeed, superstrength, or magic powers, you are following a hard path...

And if you are a good person, you are not going to ignore it. 




 Let's not be snippy. A *lot* of people, including some lawyers, don't know the difference between copyright and trademarks. 




 He will always be Captain Marvel.

Who cares if Marvel has their own Captain Marvel? 




 Your mine... is infested with zombies. Sorry, bro. 




 I guess what everyone seems most angry about on that joke is the idea that Donald Trump is one of the people on here, and that we might give money to people who simply don't need it. 




 I don't think anyone has a problem paying $35 for something that costs $30 to make (obviously including the baker's time)

A $35 ripoff would be if the cake only cost $5 to make, and they charged that much. 




 Yeah.

It's actually a fairly large country in terms of size. 




 Um.... hang on...

$28 is selling at a loss, but $35 is a ripoff?

If you are losing money selling the cake at $28, then $35 is perfectly reasonable. 




 A signed check is a contract to pay as much as is written on it.

If you presign your check, someone else can take it and write in any value they want and wipe you out financially.  




 Seriously, lie back on your back to give the most water underneath you as possible and lay still. Assuming you aren't too deep, or aren't weighted down, you will float up to the top in time to breath. 




 Yeah, a little bit. He loves the spotlight. 




 Stan Lee is an easy get...

Leonard Nimoy, Brent Spiner, Steve Wozniak, Levar Burton, George Takei... plus regular roles for Wil Wheaton (as an evil version of himself) and TV's Blossom...

Hers is particularly interesting because she was first referenced as the actress, giving her info in neurobiology, as a potential 4th player for the Physics Bowl, only to be added to the cast as the neurobiologist, Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler. 




 I've already seen it.

TV Guide: PBS - "Secrets of the CIA"

Actual show title? Cooking Secrets of the Culinary Institute of America.  




 Those shows are fun...

Aggravating, but fun. 




 [Showtime already did it.](http://m.imdb.com/title/tt0346369/) 




 Seriously, I need to buckle down and write about something.

If that idiot can make millions on a shitty, edited Twilight fanfiction, then I should be able to get something good out. 




 Ironically, that plan simply increases the use of student debt.

If they were to do this regularly, the students have an encouragement to default, the schools would raise tuition rates to raise the value of the unpaid debts and get as much as they can out of the paid ones, and the losers would be the people who donated money.

It wouldn't end tuition-related financial trouble at all. 




 Perhaps a subreddit for "glorified begging", like my idea to give $1 for each sale on my website, can be associated with this one.

All posts like "help me become a millionaire by doing X" or "help me increase donations by doing Y" go over there. 




 You dismiss the bloggers, authors, video creators as "bad ideas", but if we are interested in wantonly creating millionaires, then those are *very* good ideas. After all, I can read a few pages on a blog, watch a few videos, and read a book from Amazon's Lending Library, and it doesn't cost me a dime (compared to whatever else I'd be doing with my online time.)

It costs enough of you a little bit of reading time, it can get them a decent payday.

Hell, you don't even really need to read the book. Just set down your Kindle/Tablet/iPad, and flip the pages slowly while you play a video game. 




 Yeah, very clickbaity. 




 If I were to win, say $10,000, I would very boringly pay my credit card bills.

I could then use my cards again, and get new inventory for my store, little bits at a time, and hopefully increase sales.

I would gladly post pictures of the new inventory, and help pay it forward by factoring in future donations to the group as part of my sales.  




 Honestly, the only person that can do such a thing is a person who was already rich.

Only an idiot would literally throw away free money, unless that money held no value to him.

Trump would take $10,000 and chuck it like a stone at an unsuspecting bystander. (Well, he could. He probably wouldn't, unless it were staged.)

For someone $1000 in debt, they simply won't. 




 If it is based on who writes the most interesting comment, then it is basically a popularity contest, as opposed to a lottery.

I subbed here a while back, but normally didn't see the posts until it was too late, myself.

Edit - My use would probably be the most boring. I would pay down bills, and use any extra to buy toys to sell on my website.

If I were to offer a donation here based on my sales, would that be acceptable here? 




 There was one PSA beck when I was a kid about body image, with a girl who meets her model idol, and finds out just all the work involved to make her look hot. 




 Then again, some people are just squeamish.

But that isn't something to call names over, either.

 Yeah. It wasn't a good period of time for me, thanks to that. 




 There are *four* eggs! 




 Regular. I never should have been accepted. I wore glasses, was all but legally blind in one eye, and straight-up failed the hearing and calisthenics tests. 




 Funny.

But, no. MEPS was too interested in getting me in that they ignored my existing eye, ear, and knee problems. I officially failed those exams, but they still rubber stamped me in to fill the quota. 




 Then again, if they spaced out the junction a little more, it still might have been bridged by an older squirrel, or a snake. 




 I still remember flicking through channels and finding a program titled "Secrets of the CIA".

"Cool!" I thought, "This could be interesting..."

Turned out to be **Cooking** Secrets of the Culinary Institute of America... Instead of learning about assassination missions, I was watching how to make a quiche. 




 You were closer to being a Marine than I was being an Air Force intelligence analyst.

I was in boot camp for about a week before they realized that my body simply can't handle the military. I spent more time in the exit program than I was in actual boot camp. 




 At least he was honest enough to get rid of the tattoo? 




 At least OP's guy is saying that he *wasn't* a Marine sniper, and that he wasn't because laziness. 




 Gopher? 




 I wouldn't flag this as part of that fallacy.

The squirrel did not have any ill intent when it got itself electrocuted, it was neutral. Such an accident would be seen by everyone around as a freak occurrence. The power company and electricians would see it as the cost of doing business, and the customers would see it as an inconvenience.

In the long run, the customers only lose out if they decided to go to a hotel while the power is fixed (a completely optional choice), and the electric company would take repair costs out of preassigned funds, with likely no effect on the bottom line.

In this particular case, the destruction has a benefit of keeping electricians in work and in practice, at the cost of customers being a little hot.

 Clearly, she's an android. Only they dream of electric sheep.
