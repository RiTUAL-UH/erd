 Great, thanks for the info. 






















































 I am a High School student looking into a CS career.

I have a strong interest in CS, namely Machine Learning, AI, Genetic Algorithms, Robotics, and such.

Regardless of prestige and difficulty, what are some good schools for fields such as these with good opportunities for a major in CS?

I've seen many lists, but they have many different schools ranked inconsistently and I'm aware of the obvious schools such as CMU and Berkeley, which I am interested in, but what are some others?
