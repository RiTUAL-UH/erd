 LawBL is the best one 




 hey...me too! 




 "Fuck Finn Balooooorrrrr!" 




 1)Because the original picture was from Buzzfeed  2)Because fuck you  3) Because fuck you again 




 So according to you, three promos over the past 2 years is over-saturating? 




 I keep seeing this... in what way is he an Authority crony?  Because that one match with Reigns?  You do realize that that the point of those matches was if Reigns loses, the person he lost to would take his place in MITB.

 A living one of course... don't need dead wrestlers hanging around (see ECW's The Zombie) 




 What about Rollins vs Ambrose? 




 *Ace Crusher 




 And then The Ascension tried to murder me with a shotgun

That's a bold strategy Cotton... let's see if it pays off 




 One powerbomb, then lift them, bounce them off the ropes, into a alley oop 




 Looking at that lineup I just have 2 words for ya....... Goodbye Impact 




 Lawler saying you wont see Owens doing any moonsaults in his match with Cena.  Then Owens does a moonsault 




 Enzo would have a class where he doesn't teach anything.  Cass would be his TA 




 The Pop Tart Powerbomb 




 Mark Henry and Mae Young 




 Slobberknockers in the streets.  Tombstones through cars 




 The Olympic Gold Medalist Kurt Angle... wait I don't think I'm doing this right 




 MFW Joey slips a finger in unexpectedly 




 Welcome Back Heyman 




 Sheamus got stuck in there 




 a ladder? 




 Gas station, because he still has a lot left in the tank 




 Taker is going pee when Kane comes up through the toilet and drags him to hell 




 Reignbrose 




 Irrational fears of wrestlers 




 Other things that Owens' son likes that makes him upset 




 Damn when did El Torito get his own podcast? 




 It's is sad that people are getting this offended by one segment, yet have said nothing for years, despite this same type of thing occurring multiple times.  So sad. 




 Hey Macklemore! 




 he would not no which way to face.  

*know 




 People are going to hate you for liking a commentator, especially JBL 




 Not sure if anything was said in there but you may run across some major negativity about something that happened. 




 I hope you are just trying to make a joke 




 Overall, no.  Good moments here and there. 




 I agree to a point.  It is tough though because there are too many people out there that will like the bad guys no matter what and will not boo.  But yes, there needs to be a resurgence in the amount of heel tactics in matches like eye raking/gouging, cheap shots, low blows, etc. 




 In essence yes, you are giving them a reaction.  But, there is still a fundamental difference between booing and cheering.  Booing shows your disdain for a wrestler while cheering shows your support. For example, if Barrett is facing Neville and he hits him with a Bull Hammer, he should not get a standing ovation.  He should get a rousing chorus of boos because he is the bad guy. 




 The bigger problem is people cheering for the heels.  You are not supposed to cheer heels, you are supposed to boo them. 




 I know, it's just sucky to read when I have experienced the whole cancer thing with family members and then these people who hide behind a keyboard just make a mockery of a heartfelt thing from Cena towards a kid with cancer. 




 Hogan, Austin, Rock, Cena

Trish, Lita, Steph, Moolah 




 Because the negative posts keep getting removed or downvoted into oblivion, which they should.

Ex:

https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/387tyj/john_cena_shields_himself_with_a_cancer_survivor/ 




 Thank you... these posts about Cena exploiting the kid with cancer have made me really lose faith in humanity 




 but you don't walk when you are in a wheelchair?  You sit? 




 [OK Ric, time for our match](http://pwpop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Hogan-flair-TNA.jpg) 




 I'd like to take a selfie with someone that special 




 You really are a heartless piece aren't you? 




 You get my upvote  




 Wow you are a pessimistic piece aren't you?  He was in no way saying it was him and his catch phrase that cures cancer kids or anything like that.  HE said he goes out there and does what he does for kids like that to give them inspiration.  HE said that message is what kids in those predicaments should remember.  How does it feel to be a heartless a-hole? 




 What a [Fat Ass!](http://tinyurl.com/ohpgnab) 




 He's not even the "face of the company" 




 From the looks of last night [Prime Time Players](/spoilers) are in line for the next shot, so what difference does it make if one half of another team is in the match? 




 And Kofi is in New Day, yet he is in the match? 




 something something... Mark Henry 




 Because Reddit says so!  Now in that vain you must also hate all current commentary and believe Roman should turn heel. 




 [How bout](http://i.imgur.com/DfYjmCn.jpg)... 




 This wasn't funny the 1st time 









 The "I'm your Papi Powerbomb"

http://ews.extremewrestling.netdna-cdn.com/media/catalog/product/p/a/papieddie.jpg 




 Coal Miner's Glove 




 I noticed that.   But more so than that was the length of the replays.   They were showing whole sequences instead of just the moves.   Took a lot out of the match when I couldn't see the current action 




 Frig off Donny! 




 If Dean Ambrose were a fruit dessert made of oranges and shredded coconut and sometimes pineapple he would be Dean Ambrosia 




 My bad... it was on facebook which was a fuck up on WWE's part.  However, I don't get my definitive info from their facebook page, I get it form TV or their app where they say what's actually happening. 




 You do realize that this crowd was supposed to be a house show crowd right?  They had bought tickets for a house show and then it got changed to the special event.  It's not like this crowd was going into this as a real PPV crowd.  That is why it wasn't explosive at everything, as well as the fact that there were plenty of reasons to not be cheering their heads off. 




 It was never announced as a title match 




 It wasn't really that big of a deal.   Not like that one thing destroyed the match 




 Let's go Cena fight Owens fight 




 Become a mod then so you can change it 




 GFW is a much better choice for him, as is NJPW.  At this point it seems like TNA is a sinking ship. 




 And dear God! they are managed by Simon Dean! 




 Dean^2 Ambrose 




 Except for this one lol 




 I was once downvoted a few hundered times for saying I wasn't a fan of Naomi's derriere. 




 Noooo.... that never happens on here (hard to really show sarcasm with just words lol) 




 The majority of people on here are going to be assholes at some point just because they don't agree with you.

 




 Myspace!!??!! 




 You definitely are a piece huh 




 So Vickie Guererro losing weight is making herself fat? 




 Something something dark side... something something complete! 




 Makes sense... sorry I am a bit slow today lol 




 Something Something put in feud with top dog before even becoming main roster talent... something something don't be a debby downer 




 Oh My God!  What's Zolph Diggler doing in the ROH Zone!?!? 




 How is this bad news? 




 Piggy James, or all of the fat comments towards Vickie from Cena, Lawler, etc 




 Flair and Foley 




 He won the title from Zayn by TKO 




 Yeah it's that cross between the two. 




 "#"justrussothings 




 I always liked The Hurricane's [version](http://wrestlemation.com/gfx/image?format=raw type=orig id=3872) 




 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2bbUfIkVN0 




 Tyler Reks did and I really liked it.  He had to stop using it though because Cena "allegedly" complained it was too similar to the AA 




 You're still talking?  Sorry I lost interest. 




 Harley Race 




 I would love to see the burning hammer or death valley driver brought back.  Sadly Cena wouldn't allow that to happen. 




  Also, till I saw this I had no idea Sasha was hurt or Brock was returning, so thanks a lot asshat.

Seems like you did to me 




 /r/wtf 




 I'll give you a hint... only one is one that I actually want to come back.  The other two are for Ss and Gs 




 And you've been one for a year and don't understand the point of a [SPOILERS] tag 




 Coal Miner's Glove match

Raw Roulette

Judy Bagwell on a Pole match 




 How so?  Because I merely repeated things that other have been posting all day long?
