 Well it's $37.49 on CoolStuffInc right now, so there ya go.  




 [**Splendor**](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/148228/splendor) seems right up your alley. 30 minutes or less. Very few pieces: just tokens and you lay out a grid of cards. Very simple mechanisms, but some depth in decisions/strategy. You can teach someone how to play in under 5 minutes. I love this game.  




 When on a random friday you say to yourself 'I can either take my girlfriend out to dinner tonight or buy these 3 games...coolstuffinc purchase it is!'


No one tell my girlfriend... 




 Please, if you can, show me a screen cap of this. I'm a tech savvy person. I never saw anything resembling an option to use updated/custom rosters 









 Nope. I tried like 10 times. The option never comes up like it does in offline mode. The only option is whether I want to start season or start fantasy draft.  




 Yea, I'm still not sure about Bethancourt at the plate. He's still young so hopefully that contact rate can improve. And BJ certainly can't be worse...right?? And I wouldn't put CJ anywhere near exceptional on the defense meter. Fangraphs has him well into the negative in defensive rating every year of his MLB career 




 Same kind of thing as that...just keep plugging into different sources. Game of the Week on here, different podcasts like Secret Cabal or videos from the Dice Tower Network. Check out bgg and scroll through the rankings, see what interests you. Read the WSIG posts here. Lots of resources to find and hear about new games!

 Nice try, Chase  




 What up real insanity wolf. Nice to see you again.  




 Yea. there's still not a ton of power down there. 




 Yea, Keith said he thinks Braves just turned a bottom-5 system into a top 10 system this offseason.  




 I don't think the FO wanted to run the risk of showing Gattis anymore, especially with no protection in the lineup. If he had a poor first half of the season...goodbye all value. I think it was the right move now. As Brad Pitt/Billy Beane said in Moneyball, "when you get the answer you're looking for, hang up." 




 Did everyone watch this team last year? Can we all remember for a second how putrid this offense was? With Gattis on it. 2nd fewest runs in baseball and roughly 87345763 strikeouts. Gattis' platoon splits are not good, his defense is terrible, and he was a great story that mashed home runs versus lefties with ease. It was magical 2 years ago when he hit all those game-tying and go ahead homers. Magical. But let's not kid ourselves. This isn't trading Gretzky in his prime. It's trading a home run specialist, whose main position is the same as your top prospect, in a time where you need to juice up the farm system. It's a win for the Braves.  




 9 fedoras. 




 There's a million threads on /r/boardgames about sleeves. Just run a search. Places like Michaels, JoAnne fabrics, Hobby Lobby etc all have card sleeves for dirt cheap. 




 Because if we stop debating them and allow their voices to go unopposed and uneducated, then they begin to win and continue to push a biased, uninformed and harmful agenda. So please, do not stop arguing with anti-vaxxers. 




 *Shitrish  




 From this write up, it would seem a great haul. I don't know much about any of these guys. To be fair, Law has never been a big Gattis fine, sighting his K rate, awful defense and platoon splits, so he'd probably see any decent return as a windfall for Braves 




 at 16 bricks of 12.4 kg each, and a current rate $1,260.80 USD per ounce, that's $8,042,275.20 USD of gold 




 [This is a list on BGG of games with solo variants](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/49479/soloplay-variants-posted-geek) 




 It's insider so I copied the text below. [Here's the link](http://insider.espn.go.com/blog/keith-law/post?id=3225 ex_cid=InsiderTwitter_Law_GattisTrade)

In dealing a trio of prospects for Evan Gattis, I really don't understand what the Astros are doing. The prospect depth they have in their system could allow them to acquire a player of a much higher caliber than Gattis, preferably a younger one as well, someone who's going to contribute to the next good Astros team in a few years. Atlanta, meanwhile, has gone from a bottom-five system in baseball to likely a top-10 system, overhauling their major-league roster while adding a broad mix of near- and long-term talent to their farm, in this case trading a player somewhere near the apex of his value for a very strong return. 

Gattis is already 28 years old, coming back to pro ball late after several years of off-field problems, and he brings four years of control. In two not-quite-full major-league seasons, he's shown big power, poor defense, horrible on-base skills, and huge platoon splits -- killing lefties but posting a .241/.297/.469 line against right-handers with enormous problems against right-handed breaking stuff. While Houston's a good ballpark for dead-pull right-handed power hitters, he's virtually positionless and doesn't address the Astros' major needs for hitters who get on base or at least make more contact. He's also disappeared in the second half in both of his years in the majors -- whether due to physical wear and tear or inability to make in-season adjustments -- and his body isn't durable. He's probably a bench guy, or a platoon player, but not a full-time solution at any position. The Astros also pick up James Hoyt, a hard-throwing (93-97 mph) right-hander that Atlanta signed from an independent league for $500 after the 2012 season, a good bet to provide some value in middle relief right away. 

In exchange for Gattis, Atlanta gets three prospects with question marks, but all of whom are legitimate major-league prospects with real asset value today. Mike Foltynewicz is the big get, and I would have traded Gattis for him alone. Folty is a high-beta prospect with the upside of a potential No. 1 starter if he can develop a more consistent arm slot and find an average third pitch to go along with an 80 fastball and 70 curveball. He drops down on the fastball at times and comes back up to get depth on the curveball, a trick that major-league hitters will exploit. His changeup will show plus, and ditching his slider (which he did early in 2014) may help him spend more time working on the change, but the change isn't good enough now to keep lefties from sitting on his four-seamer. Drafted in the first round in 2010, he's never seen the DL, and has the size and frame to be a durable 200-inning starter. His floor is a Nate Eovaldi type, and he'd be a wipeout reliever, but Atlanta has to develop him as a starter and hope the changeup comes along to the point where he can lead their rotation in 2017. 

Third baseman Rio Ruiz has developed nicely as a hitter, showing outstanding patience -- his walk rate put him among the top 10% of minor-league hitters this year, even though he was just 20 in a high-A league. Lancaster is a tremendous place to hit, however, and his power output was a little light given his home environment. He has good natural feel to hit and much of his contact is hard, but his load is getting too deep with his weight too much on his back side, interfering with his timing and reducing his ability to drive the ball out. At third base, he has the hands and arm, but he lacks rhythm in his feet and the ball tends to play him unless he's coming in on it; he has a chance to play at third, although it's at least 50/50 that he moves to first. Unlike a lot of young left-handed hitters, he has no real problem facing lefties. He projects as something similar to what Matt Carpenter has become for the Cardinals -- a high-OBP doubles hitter, a little less glove, a little more pop -- if he can stay at the hot corner. 

Andrew Thurman was a command right-hander when the Astros took him out of UC-Irvine in the second round in 2013, then started hitting 95-96 in spring training last year, only to head to the cold weather of the Midwest League and struggle with his control. He'll pitch with a 55 fastball and shows three potentially average or better secondary pitches, but nothing is plus and he has to throw strikes to succeed. I still like him as a potential fourth or fifth starter, but that assumes that he can harness his newfound velocity and stop walking guys. Of the three guys Atlanta got back in this trade, he has the lowest ceiling and the lowest probability, the latter due to his difficulty against low-A hitters last season. 

There's a good chance Atlanta walks out of this deal with an above-average starting pitcher and an everyday third baseman, which would be a heck of a return for a flawed player like Gattis. The Astros get four years of control of Gattis, and if they choose to use him behind the plate on occasion, the acquisition might free them up to trade one of their many catchers ... but is this the kind of player the Astros should be trying to acquire right now? They're not contenders this year, probably not in 2016, and by 2017 Gattis will be turning 31 and past peak, which we've probably already seen. I have no objection to the Astros trading from their passel of prospects to add real major-league talent, but they should be aiming higher than an OBP sinkhole who doesn't add value on defense. Foltynewicz is well-regarded throughout the industry, and I think he could have headlined a package for a much better player, now or during the 2014 season.

 Can...can I get Five Tribes from you? 




 try meetup.com. I know my area has several groups coordinated through meetup that gather at various bars or cafes to play board games.  




 My only tip would be to all play as humans. Keeps everything even throughout the players and lets you get the understanding of the game. and ass /u/Show-Me-Your-Moves said, don't add house rules before you play the game. I've played lots of Eclipse and have never removed missiles and it's not a big deal. Sometimes someone gets missiles early, sometimes they come out real late. Sometimes someone gets a bunch of awesome discovery tiles and you don't. Things balance out during the game and each game unfolds differently.  




 I think the general sentiment isn't about having to go into a walmart, but supporting their business in general.  




 Well didn't you just buy it from them? 




 Boo walmart 




 Spector Ops looks preeetty sweet. Hearing good things on Spirits of The Rice Paddy as well. And I don't know if they'll allow it, but if you can snag a pre-order discount on the upcoming printing of Dead of Winter, do that too.  









 [**Acquire**](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/5/acquire) 




  Are the Egyptians and Japanese actually much harder than the others?


Only in a board game thread is that ok to ask.  




 **King of New York** is not a reprint. It's basically a sequel. Or a standalone expansion of King of Tokyo. And it's better than KoT. More strategy, more interaction, more decisions, more destruction, more fun.  




 The Secret Cabal podcast is my favorite. They release new episodes the 2nd Wednesday of every month, each episode is 2-3 hours so you get a lot of content. They do a great mix of talking about games they played that week, reviewing 1 game at length each episode, going over news and updates in the board game world, and if you're into RPG stuff, they talk about that too. They do contests occasionally too. It's good stuff 




 I think it's just as cool for people who don't know a lot about the Cold War, because the game organically teaches you so much about it. You're playing the game as you see history unfold.  




 The box art is pretty bland, but the board is gorgeous, and the cards are very nice as well. The game is just so incredibly balanced and the theme is absolute perfection. It very much is a 'struggle' as every decision you make has a big impact and many of those decisions you make may very well benefit your opponent. It's all about doing your best to minimize what you give your opponent and maximize what you do and score as best as possible. It is a masterpiece.  




 Ha, that's true. I guess I was just referring to the box size. 




 Yea, I feel you. What about taking a look at some scores from Cold War movies like Dr. Strangelove, Good Night   Good Luck, Tinker Taylor Soldier Spy, Hunt For Red October or the TV show The Americans.  




 I wondered to myself "I wonder what I'll find if I google 'cold war music." [This is what I found. Everything is on wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_songs_about_the_Cold_War). That should help for Twilight Struggle! 




 How about [**Jaipur**](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/54043/jaipur) or [**Hive Pocket**](http://www.amazon.com/Gen42-Games-5513668-Hive-Pocket/dp/B0079L0EKY/ref=sr_1_3?s=toys-and-games ie=UTF8 qid=1419971594 sr=1-3 keywords=hive)? [**Mr Jack Pocket**](http://www.amazon.com/Asmodee-700400ASM-Mr-Jack-Pocket/dp/B0040LJVNM/ref=sr_1_1?s=toys-and-games ie=UTF8 qid=1419971684 sr=1-1 keywords=mr+jack+pocket) is also wonderful. [**Star Realms**](http://www.amazon.com/White-Wizard-Games-Realms-Deckbuilding/dp/B00HRGMPIU/ref=sr_1_8?s=toys-and-games ie=UTF8 qid=1419971722 sr=1-8 keywords=eight+minute+empire) is the best micro game of the year IMHO, and scales past 2P with multiple decks. [**Coup**](http://www.amazon.com/Coup-Card-Game-Resistance-Universe/dp/B00GDI4HX4/ref=sr_1_6?s=toys-and-games ie=UTF8 qid=1419971722 sr=1-6 keywords=eight+minute+empire) is also a lot of fun and quick. I personally do not like **Cheaty Mages** at all.  




 Nice!  




 This thread will make me depressed to see how many bajillion more plays other people got than me this year :( 




 I enjoy the [Settlers of America](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/67239/settlers-america-trails-rails). Cities   Knights is probably the most popular expansion (i think?). 


Overall, in /r/boardgames, you're going to find a lot of Catan hate (and some love). It's such a popular game, a lot of people got their board game start playing it, and playing it to death, before moving on to games with much more strategy and depth. 


How old is your son? Ticket To Ride is a great intro game. Other games like Carcassonne or Dominion are easy enough to pick up, but off a ton of depth in strategy and replayability. Splendor is a new hotness that's simple, fun and strategic. Takenoko is a big hit with my gf who hates board games. It's a light, fun, beautiful game, and has a similar hexagonal tile element.  




 Filtering it [this way](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_pg_1?rh=n%3A165793011%2Cn%3A%212334111011%2Cn%3A%212334142011%2Cn%3A2241292011%2Cn%3A10222887011 ie=UTF8 qid=1419948673 ajr=2) also gets some other games shown in the sales. Among The Stars, a Sentinels expansion, GoT LCG deck. Couple others.  




 Kind of a weak sale. It's only a few dollars off what those games usually are.  




 Exactly this. Someone in my group will usually say this when someone is clearly distracted/not paying attention. It's a polite reminder of "hurry up" or "pay attention"

 I bought this from an Amazon sale a couple weeks ago for the same price. Finally got it to the table last night and I loved it! Played two 2 player games, then a 4 player game. Works wonderfully with both. Quick, super easy to pick up and still some good strategy and decision making to be done. The 'reserve a card' option is a neat twist.  




 The ios app is phenomenal as well. Especially if you're playing solo, saves you all the time of setting it up just for yourself.  




 The Agricola solo variant is great. 




 Wears down the surrounding area to even out surface. Then paint over.  




 What if it's obvious where it would be. For instance, went to my girlfriend's apartment and the person that lives in the next apartment who I've met twice (and is super friendly) clearly didn't remember me and introduced himself to me. Even after I said "hey Michael." Just didn't want to give him the "yea, we've met before."  









 Ditto this. I've played 2p with just the bottom section. That was better. Otherwise it's just two people playing by themselves in the same game. Map is way too big for 2 players. My favorite game of all time though. 




 JoAnne's. Michaels. Hobby Lobby. Amazon. Dollar store.  




 Uggla gets a lot of hate here (deservedly so, he was awful), but I always liked him and I'll always root for him. He never pouted, he showed up every day, and he always booked it to first on easy ground balls. I hope he catches on somewhere outside of the NL East and does well.  




 I can only speak for Agricola here...it's tough to get people into Agricola that aren't into heavy euros. Agricola is hard. If people are new to games (or only know settlers, ticket to ride or pandemic), it's a tough leap. There are more complex games, but Agricola just really beats you up, ya gotta make sure people like worker placement euros where you may feel like you didn't do shit for the last 6 turns. That said, I love Agricola. I'll play with you!

 My work computer won't allow me to download flux. Any recommendations on the RGB settings on the monitor to help with this? 




 8 hours?! Yeesh. Even with rule checking etc, sounds like you guys have a lot of analysis paralysis. I own the game, and have never had a game go over 4 hours. My recommendation: agree to a shot clock. Don't sit in the headline phase for 5 minutes agonizing over which event card to play or where to place influence etc. Set a time limit that you'll both agree to stay within to the best of your ability. And that should organically work out anyway as you get more comfortable with the game and what cards will be coming.  




 I just bought Shadow of Mordor and started the campaign last night, for a couple hours. It seems from the opening cuts that I, and my family, was killed. Now I'm just running around killing Uruk.

 No, it wasn't salt water 




 I lent my Canon T3i to a friend for the day. As the friend was shooting he tripped, fell and plunged into a pond. My camera around his neck. He has reimbursed me for the camera but I'm wondering if there's anyway to fix the water logged one. It's been a couple months since so it's had sufficient time to dry out, but it doesn't turn or anything. Any chance I could take it somewhere to swap out a part or fix it somehow? 




 Yea, I just don't really want to spend $300 on something I'll use once a month or once every few months.  









 I'd give it a whirl. My grandparents are devour US History or Art History. My grandmother is a painter and illustrator and adores the french and dutch masters. Most of the books you'll find in their house or biographies of painters, US Presidents, Churchill, WWI, WWII or events revolving around one of those topics. I like to add to that passion and collection each Christmas.  




 They would not be into that, but I appreciate the thought.  




 I don't read a ton of non-fiction, but I do read a few a year. Every Christmas I get my grandparents a non-fiction work (lots of presidential biographies, McCollough, Kearns-Goodwin, painter bios) but this year as I walk around Barnes   Noble, all I can seem to find are celebrity memoirs or Bill O'Reilly books. Is this a total down year for history work? Is there anything worth picking up?

 **King of Tokyo/King of New York**. It goes up to 6 and is loads of fun. I've used it a ton as a fun gateway game to people who aren't into board games at all and it's always a hit.  




 **Dead of Winter.** 

It is an overall cooperative game. You need to complete the main objective together. However, everyone also has a secret objective (none, one or some of which may be a betrayal objective) that each person needs to attempt to complete so they can individually win. It adds a lot of tension, suspicion between players (you never know if anyone has a betrayal objective or how many people may). This game is phenomenal.

 It seems like before and shortly after the release of Five Tribes, it was all the hotness. People couldn't wait for it, and then when they got it people loved it. Is it just me or since then, after people have had it for a bit, has all the buzz died? Is the replayability poor? I've been eyeing it for purchase, but now I'm not sure.
