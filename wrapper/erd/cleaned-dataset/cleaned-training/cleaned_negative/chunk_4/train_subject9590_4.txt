 Not to detract from Unidan's greatness but I'm pretty sure it's a Simpson's quote. 




 My fraternity house is literally a minute walk away from the stadium for Georgia Tech in Atlanta and a ton of people would drive by it to park on gameday. We would stand out in the road(not blocking traffic obviously) with a beer and a sign saying you honk we drink and basically every car that went by would honk. Whenever cops would roll by all the time and do their little *woop woop* siren and we would finish the can. It was awesome.

I was also only 18 at the beginning of this and looked about 16 so basically the cops didn't give a fuck/ 




 I don't think it's RES, if you open a incognito window and paste the image link in to get it to load again it still happens. Must be something to do with the website 




 I seriously want to know the answer to this question. Were you using RES as well? 




 Pulling the old Sir John A. Macdonald, only Canadian Prime Minister to win six majority governments.

  One famous story is that during an election debate Macdonald was so drunk he began vomiting violently on stage while his opponent was speaking. Picking himself up Macdonald told the crowd, "see how my opponent's ideas disgust me."

In another version of the story, he responded to his opponent's query of his drunkenness with "It goes to show that I would rather have a drunk Conservative than a sober Liberal.". 




 You're correct, thank you. I believe everyone should unequivocally be treated with respect unless they do something making them lose it. I am just curious but you're right there really is no way to explain the whole gender spectrum, it just is. 




 Go the fuck away 




 I've never understood the term gender fluid. I 100% believe that due to brain chemistry, hormones, etc. some people who were born one sex feel like the other. I'm not saying I don't believe that people are actually gender fluid and feel like different sexes at different times, I just don't understand at all what would cause this. 




 I want the world to know 




 Not even just his stuff haha... OP got my car stolen by leaving my keys in my unlocked car. 




 Remeber that time you got my car stolen? None of this surprises me at all 




 I'm pretty sure what he was thinking about, something to do with a copious amount of drugs. 

This is the same kid that got my car stolen by leaving my keys in my unlocked car outside a party in a sketchy area. Luckily I found my car at 7AM next morning parked just around the corner from where I had parked it. The keys were sitting **on my hood** in plain view so I guess someone had a fun joyride in it. Somehow he always gets super luckily with the dumb shit he does. 




 I'm just guessing here but I bet the reasoning is to try to prove they're an "alpha" male not a push-over pussy "beta". Combine that with the severe social ineptitude that these people are bound to have and you get this creepy, disturbing shit. 




 I ashamed to even be able to answer this but its called "negging" and it is the dumbest thing ever, especially for the type of severely socially inept people that the PUA "technique" appeals to. 




 Don't forget about /r/AnimalPorn ,  all the badass animals of the world together in a sub! 




 The worst is /r/HumanPorn , it's like whoever creates those subreddits doesn't even think of what the word porn means to most people anymore.  




 This is a long shot but was it asherons call? 




 Ich stimme zu. 




 No he sensationalized it pretty heavily. I can't see anything constructive about adding 2 base pairs to DNA, when life seems to do fine with just 4. Maybe it will give us more choices with amino acids, etc. but considering we can't even really design our own proteins now due to post-translation modifications and not understanding folding and a whole number of other issues.

This is pretty cool I guess but nothing super ground breaking and I believe it implies that we are close to things like designing our own proteins that nature could never design when in actuality we are pretty far away. It also really doesn't seem like this author understands the whole transcription and translation process and how this applies to building proteins

BTW fuck you ryan 




 Rob Ford for President 2016. fuck the constitution we need him here in the states 




 So we should just disregard 90% of the community because of your opinion? 




 But it does bring a group of similar minded people together. I am subscribed to /r/drugs but I never really post there. I will admit sometimes the posts get me cravings to do those drugs but it has not increased my overall drug use at all and is a very knowledgeable and for the most part level-headed community. 




 I always thought brilliant writers hold most of the cards compared to publishers, especially if they're as established as Fitzgerald(I'm not sure if he was at the time though I guess). I would think he could put whatever he wants in his book but I guess that's not true.  




 Oh wow yeah! Ba$h was the shit. I remember i would go to his arena(?go bash) and fuck around with him because you had like unlimited repels and thor's and boosts and all the values for the ships were messed around with. It was a lot of fun 




 For some reason the only name I can remember from back then is Callidus. NO idea why that stuck with me. 




 So I guess I got butthole gainz wasted last night haha? Don't really remember writing any of this 




 I can't remember.. can't even remember what squad I was in but it wasn't like a top tier one, maybe second tier squad. 

I played dep all the time and could break some ankles as scout too. This is annoying me that I can't think of what my name was but I'm sure it was really dumb, I was 12. 




 So it's a 2d game where you control various types of ships using only the key board. Tab is shoot rockets, ctrl is bullets. It's basically like that old school asteroids game where you except multiplayer with 8 different types of ships, objectives(CTF, king of the hill, etc.) and ton of different weapons. The objectives on the maps are super fun, the game has a great community and it's really easy to pick up but hard to master. It's definitely worth the 5 minutes it takes to install it and try it out.


 




 Come play. It literally takes 5 mins to dl and install and I'm getting a nostalgia overload. It would also be nice to have a few more people playing. 




 Fuck that hell no. Moistening is the most female thing I could possibly think of, you gotta do it bareback and dry as the Sahara  




 Hey so I did a little research to try to find the map files and I found this.

 http://www.subspace.co/topic/26130-sscl-metal-gear-ctf-it-was-back-but-now-its-gone-again//


You could probablu try to email someone from that thread and ask.

This was only about 2 years ago so it's relatively recent  




 The trick is to start shitting a couple times a day for a couple of days. This should be more than you usually do and you may need supplements to reach your shit quota. This is rip your butthole to shread. Now comes the hard part. For the next 2 weeks you are allowed one shit a week. This allows the tissue to heal. After these 3 weeks you will notice some sick gains in your butthole strength. Feel free to post pictures of your technique and I'll take a look at em ;) 




 Ah, Evolved rings a bell. That was like one of the most elite squads right 




 I'm actually on EG right now, but I can't figure it out really 




 Yeah some of those. I just to love fishies and football and the 1v1 tourneys and elim 




 I changed it! sorry about that it was the first one that popped up on google and it seemed legit. 




 I'm not sure but I changed it to a different website that has brrn updated more recently just in case 




 Probably around 02-04. I cant remember my name for the life of me or what guild or whatever it was called i was in. I used to be really good at dep and scout 




 Yep I'm currently on trench wars getting absolutely massacred  




 I don't remember what my username was but I do remember callidus was fucking amazing and I would always dep for her. Miss playing soldier too, and the #2 scout damn good days 




 Sounds like that might have been Trench Wars. People still play, there's usually 60-100 people on and peak times.

Edit: actualy 158 on right now on that server 




 That's the only server I played for the two years I really played continuum and I just liked it a lot better than Trench Wars or Extreme Game. Maybe I don't know the nuances of those servers well enough but I long to play some metal gear. Does anyone else feel similar? 




 I know it's awesome. I should have described it more when i made the post but I was too lazy. What servers did you play on? I played Metal Gear CTF 




 What server? I played metal gear CTF and its so much different I still haven't quite figured out trench wars and that other big server, extreme games maybe? 




 I have a script for xanax... after all the opiates I've done, benzo's dont really give me much euphoria, a little, but not a lot. 




 Is it bad that that movie made me want to swindle and manipulate the shit out of people and fuck them over completely in the process so I could get that kind of life and do that many drugs and fuck so many dimes. 




 Dude it was all about metal gear. I loved that server. It's not up anymore though =( 




 Oh.. I guess I'm more of a TagAmateur than a Tag pro. I'm only like 15 degrees 




 And be sure to inject butter directly into your blood stream every 4 hours to alleviate the debilitating emotional pain 




 Do you think you're better than me? You're a pussy with your pristine asshole than isn't so covered with scar tissue that you can poop in under 2 hours. I laugh at you before you laugh at me 




 I would periodically move things around their desk around while they are focused on something else. Maybe move a notebook from a drawer onto the desk. Maybe move a pen they just had in their hand onto the other side of the desk. Things that would be physically impossible to happen. This would be very subtle, maybe once or twice a month at most. Gradually I'd start doing more obvious things, like unplugging their monitor or making a stapler fall off their desk for no reason. 

Maybe after 6 months of this, I would start writing messages to them, either using a pen and one of their notbooks that is out of sight, or distracting them enough to write something like **LEAVE THIS PLACE** OR **WAKE UP** on their computer. Maybe I would do this with notes or if they are working on something in word, just type it in the middle of their document. Eventually they would begin to doubt their sanity. As they neared the breaking point, if I sensed they we're going ot loose it soon, I would draw dickbutt in paint and tile it as their background. I would then write "turn around" and have a couple hundred thousands dollars in my hand(which I had stolen using telekinesis) and give it to them to maybe make up for the torture. 




 Do you want me to sit in a corner and rust or just fall apart where I'm standing?  




 I'm currently toughing my asshole up. I started with singly ply and then I found half ply, next the finest grain sand paper available. I gradually increased the grain fineness over the course of the past two years and now I use steel wool and I feel manly as fuck. 

It's like that ass pennies sketch. If i ever am uncomfortable around someone I just think their candy ass can't wipe with steel wool, they don't deserve to be in my presence.
 




 Well I(along with many many other people I assume) am a completely different person on the internet than I am in real life. I would never even think about saying anything like that to anyone I know. It's kind of like how you change how you act, even if only a little, depending on the people you're around 




 COuld I be your unlikely morbid, depressed and callous robot penguin sidekick. 




 Or you could just spend a dollar or 2 extra to avoid the butthole pillaging altogether.  




 For each their own... anonymity breeds weirdness 




 [Continuum](http://www.subspace.co/). Archaic game the is incredibly addicting and fun

Edit: Wish I had put more effort into this post, I feel like it could be much higher up 




 I seriously think they should make a tagpro type game with a 3d engine. Maybe something a little like LoL, you would have skills(like jukes or spins or sprint) which would be on a cool down. Maybe even different classes(scout, defender, etc.) too but you would move with WASD.

Edit: Just to clarify how I'm picturing it: It would still be CTF. The only way to die would still be running into each other, or maybe some type of special move. Maybe there would be some projectile type attacks you could aim with the arrow keys, but of coursee they would have cooldowns.

Can anyone elaborate on why this would be a bad idea. I don't care of downvotes I'm just curious
  




 To be honestly I was just trying to type the weirdest possible thing I could ala /u/mroglolblo or /u/_vargas_. Just wanted to try it out, had never done it before

If you want to read some stories kinda like that except a millions times better go through mrog's history

Here's a preview
I wouldn't want to have sex with the queen but it could be kind of hot if she watched. She has always seemed like she has a "wry" sense of humor and has always struck me as a woman of intense curiosity. How cool would it be to bring a chick back to your place and she sees the queen sitting in a chair in the corner as you frantically undress each other and she stops and says "oh gosh, it's you!" "It is an honor your majesty!" and she awkwardly curtsies while covering her tits with one hand, "charmed my dear, now start fucking!" At first she is really demure and tries to be as tender and "proper" as possible, missionary only etc. and the queen starts shrieking "none of that, when I said start fucking, I meant start FUCKING!!!" and maintains steely eye contact with her 




 So OP's picture is literally the first one to come up for chinese english tattoo on google image. [Here's the second](http://i.imgur.com/hRGQoJh.jpg) 




 Plot Twist: His boss is a transvestite and he caught her right after she had finished jackin it. 




 I mean what I wrote is just as plausible as the OP's story honestly. 




 Only thing left to do is post this picture of an intimate situation between two people publicly for literally everyone I even kind of know can see it. 




 That's when you say oh here let me wipe that off for you and pull out your rock hard dick and ever so tenderly get every drop on the tip of your dick. 

The moment is finally here! That skill you've been practicing for months, that you've put your life and soul in, it's moment has arrived. You lie down and prepare. Pushing your dick down as far as it will go you steady yourself. Using the cock pushup acquired dick strength, you let her rip. The the cum is shot in a perfect arc right into your own open mouth. A flawless dick catapult. The man juice in your mouth tastes better than ever before, you literally have an orgasm in your mouth. 




 Heart of Gold 




 Don't forget to run it under some warm Code Red first. 




 Wish the same thing could have been said about his pituitary gland :(. He was such an amazing person 




 Aw. Guess just exorbitant amounts of coke will have to fill the void. 




 I don't know if I could handle those Zefs there though(unless they look like Yolandi). Are they like the SA version of chavs? 




 The name roach is very fitting for them 




 Does this imply most of his novels underwent similar censorship? 




 You forgot the type a horrible comment step somewhere before exit out. 




 Watching that movie makes me want to do so many drugs. Does anyone know if ludes were actually as awesome as they make them out to be? 




 For snorting coke, I'd say the norm is 20-40 mins between lines depending on how much you have 




 Can you provide proof for any of this? The majority of other posts in this thread seem to say the exact opposite. 




 I envy you as well. I've got a 5 hours left till my engineering degree and my recent lack of a social life has kind of left me unmotivated to put my all into school. I am on medication of depression and anxiety but I feel some kind of therapy would help but so far the 2 therapists I've seen haven't really helped. 




 For some reason I read that as conversation... I'm a pretty quite guy and sometimes have trouble holding conversations with 
people I don't know well and was just seeing if maybe that type of therapy would help me but I guess some other type of therapy would be much better
 




 7What about the amazonian(I think) fish thing that swims up your urethra when you pee and lodges itself in there.  




 Can I ask what you symptoms you were treated for. 




 It seems to be it's just a bit more specific than his earlier claim and meant to clarify. 




 Of course inflation has a bit to do with it as well. 




 Who cares? Your'e a fucking dick 




 I know right. I speak a little German so I understood maybe like half of it but it was like a really weird mix of german and english 




 Don't forget about your duderuses either. 




 Do you mean alprazolam? Altrazaplan isn't anything
 




 Yep, I remember reading in biochem that the best internal combustion engine is only around 30-40% efficient in harnessing the energy produced by breaking C-H bonds, while our bodies are 60-70% efficient. 




 What? That's crazy I live in Texas and it's only around $3.30-$3.50 




 I found [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/23dyes/recap_the_failed_moderation_and_gaming_of/cgyf5y4) a little while ago... Take it with a grain of salt obviously
 




 Ah I see, didn't catch that 




 I've tripped more times than I can count and I was want to say you have a really good idea of what it's like for someone who hasn't done it. I would definitely recommend trying it at least once, but only in the right environment. It's really just gives you a whole new perspective on things and is quite interesting. 




 It's still on? I thought it got canceled cause I've only seen a few episodes. 




 Thank you that's really interesting and I would never notice anything like that. I also appreciate you being so civil cause I honestly don't understand why this question got so much hate. 




 I never said she looked better with no make up on.. I meant this style of make up. Maybe I didn't word it quite right but this is just ridiculous. I asked a legitimate question I was curious about Sorry for trying to expand my horizons a bit 




 Haha I'm suprised anyone understood that at all... so many typos damn swype 




 I think we're not on the same page. I was talking more about the neuroscience part like /u/mroxiful  




 Yes 3 legs on the ground at all times makes walking very simple but what about for walking over things? What about getting away from predators? Etc. Is it the most efficient for all these factors which highly influence the life and death of the insect and in turn the strength of the colony.
 




 Same. I'm done wasting my time arguing about it, what a waste of 45 minutes. 




 Thanks, I didn't know about the earlier models but it makes perfect sense. 




 I guess /r/science spoils me in this regard 




 Maybe it is that simple, but I'm sure there are other factors at play. Yes 3 legs on the ground at all times is great but what about for walking over things? What about getting away from predators? Etc. Is it the most efficient for all these factors which highly influence the life and death of the insect and in turn the strength of the colony. 

It obviously is because insects have 6 legs but what I'm trying to say it's not just basic geometry by any means. 

Source: Many classes from my biomedical engineering degree and a little bit of critical thinking 




 Maybe it is that simple, but I'm sure there are other factors at play. Yes 3 legs on the ground at all times is great but what about for walking over things? What about getting away from predators? Etc. Is it the most efficient for all these factors?  




 Exactly! Many cases.. not all. 




 Maybe he did and couldn't find anything so he decided to ask the person who was making the claim. I'm willing to bet that's the case actually.

Any critical thinking, scientifically literate person would do the same thing. 




 I think you are probably right but just because it seems to make sense doesn't mean it's necessarily true, and if it is true it shouldn't be too hard to do a google or google scholar search to provide a source and remove all doubt 




 I can and I'm sure he can too, but just because it seems to make sense doesn't mean it's true by any means.  




 It makes me sad that some people so blindly believe things that they would condescendingly question why you don't. 




 Do you have any idea what that robotic pack mule was 4 legged and modeled after mammals, than after something like this. Maybe the who size difference and surface area to volume ratio thing?
