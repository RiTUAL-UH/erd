 Fat man and little boy, although while short of stature he was indeed a giant. It's a pity Fermi died so young. 




 Looks to be about 1946 Chief. They stopped using the 1/2 leaf spring on the front end after the war.  




 Well, you're in luck. Check out his [channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJzgDS6e4qCckIywGxCyvgw). And if you haven't seen Iain Stewart's [youtube stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q_kPZZgpHs list=PL832tWrspuPm2Lls9MMKjCtSxOrhIpRZ2) it's also great geo-tainment. 




 Yes. 














 r/militaryporn would likely appreciate this. Great find, and one very lucky ~~soldier~~ coast guardsman. 














 "Manhattan District" is from the source title

 Hin-mah-too-yah-lat-kekt never saw his beloved Wallowa valley again. 









 I believe the photograph you found to be more accurate. I tried to find original source for the one I posted without success.

I will delete mine as I believe it is of poorer quality and appears to be doctored. Perhaps you should post yours.

Thanks! 




 How do we know if a tree is lonely?

 Even as a Dodger fan I had to admire Mr October. 









 Current hypothesis is [methane burst in warming permafrost.](http://www.nature.com/news/mysterious-siberian-crater-attributed-to-methane-1.15649) 



















 Cheap, tough, practical. Nothing beats it. 




 The ancient deserts of Western Pangaea. I love Navajo Sandstone

 I always enjoyed [this movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYIcc9IBZj4) for some great 917 *et al* music 




 [Here](http://www.pbase.com/drjaysel/image/87690309/original) is another view. I think it's bits of metal hammered on. 









 Looks Silver, too. 




 Is this machine the wedge, or the inclined plane? 














 And thanks for the link, our convict past is always so murky. 




 I would think so, but it's clearly an F, so I let the stone speak for itself. 









 Sorry, sleep deprived, and thanks. 




 The photo caption I found on wikipedia doesn't give a specific date:

"The BSA Gold Star, (19381963), is a 350 cc and 500 cc 4-stroke production motorcycle that gained its reputation for being one of the fastest machines of the 1950s. These motorcycles were popular for their high performance. Besides being hand built, with many optional performance modifications available, they came from the factory with documented dynamometer test results, allowing the new owner to see the horsepower produced."

 Love the Porsche 917; I was just watching *Le Mans* last night! 




 Is it nesting?

 Subcontractor for McDonnell Douglas in North Hollywood about '73, I was a machine operator, just one step up from sweeping the floor and deburring. I dropped a part with many hours of work on it. It was distorted-scrap. Coolant can make parts slippery. . .

 Ain't it a shame when honesty is noteworthy? 




 The helicopters resemble bugs.  









 Lucas knew a good thing when he saw it. Ralph was a genius. 




 They think they're in control. Heh. 




 Or the manager will better know his employees. "You asshole, what are you doing joyriding on a customer's bike? This is a business we're running here!" 




 Better slow once than fast twice, as my shop foreman told me years ago after i wasted a nice chunk of the company's change. 




 Some will need a damper 




 You forget stage eight where you get old, have arthritis and can't tie yourself into a knot to ride the sport bike anymore. *sigh* 




 $5,000? Why not $50,000? It's a Ferrari, after all. 




 I love a good Cav/Pag, but not with this clown.

 A great year for both; Duke released [Money Jungle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZZCxQrM_aA) the same year. 




 Great pic! 




 Felice Bonetto in the [Cisitalia D46](http://www.ultimatecarpage.com/images/large/975-1.jpg), "rolling sculpture". Alas, he was killed racing in Portugal in 1953. 









 That's great composition. 




 Good stuff, thanks.

 Of course this is not a transistor radio, a bit too early for that and one can see the vacuum tubes protruding from her hat.

While the transistor was invented in 1947 the first commercially available transistor radio was the Regency TR-1 in 1954.

 Love the stride feel.  









  Nice Eames chair, too. 




 All of Gottlieb's stuff is public domain, he gave it away. What a gift, what a mensch.

 Lean made many great films, but this is his greatest. 














 I think it's Hickory House.

Edit: nope, Downbeat on 52nd

"Seen in the mirror is Gillespie and the Barbara Carroll Trio, which worked opposite Dizzy Gillespie at the Downbeat Club from July 18 and into August."

 I don't recall where I heard this, but Bird was said to stuff cotton in his cheeks when playing in Jay McShann's band to simulate playing. When it was his turn to solo a buddy would elbow him out his smack-induced fog and he'd take off. What a waste. 









 Thank you, Clark. Big tears here. 




 Well they certainly are cool, great pic.
