 Gotcha. Thanks :) 




 Yes, this is true. Although the US Constitution does supersede this and the Supreme Court would rule against it (most likely) as you pointed out, the states do have their rights too, just like how states can have legal medical marijuana although it is still illegal on a federal level.

Why shouldn't I believe that these states have these articles? They are written in text by the governments of the states and that is sufficient evidence for me. 




 Someone already posted a fixed version?
