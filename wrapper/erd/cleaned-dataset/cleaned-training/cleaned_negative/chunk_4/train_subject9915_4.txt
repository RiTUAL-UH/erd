 Yes. It a secular variation of the ceremony from [Peter Gilmore's Satanic Scriptures](http://www.thesatanicscriptures.com/blog/). Because we had family from both sides attending we decided to remove some terms that would make things awkward, but we kept the idea the same. A celebration of two individuals joining together, working towards the same goals, enjoying life. It was ordained by a Reverend in the COS. 




 Coop is a solid guy. Another photo, slightly awkward due to cropping, but taken from the dinner on the eve of my wedding, at Trade Vic's in Downtown LA. Coop won the best shirt contest at the table. http://imgur.com/ki7e9Lq

I guess the gentleman throwing the horns is kind of a giveaway (taken backstage at a music festival in Germany).

 




 If that kind of symbolism and imagery works for you, then go for it. Keep in mind that what goes on in the ritual chamber is self imposed ignorance, fantasy... the Intellectual Decompression Chamber.  If anyone thinks they are actually talking to or summoning demons then I'd suggest therapy. 









 Something that might interest you, here's an interview with Ashely S. Palmer of ASP Apparel on the 9sense Satanic podcast. He talks about the Church of Satan Walpurgisnacht celebration at the Dashwood Hellfire Caves Buckinghamshire, Southeast England.

http://www.ashleyspalmer.com/9sense-interview-dec2011/ 




 Read the material, and live your life as you see fit. Some of the most Satanic people I've ever met rarely ever directly talk about Satanism in public (unless asked about it), but they apply the philosophy and aesthetic discretely to their art, writing, careers, etc.   

The Church of Satan is an international organization and we have many members in England, including some of our most active. Joining the Church of Satan *is not required* to be a Satanist, but if you wish to support the organization and get to know other Satanists then [you can sign up here](http://churchofsatan.com/join-the-cos.php).

One of my good friends is in England and runs the [ASP Apparel](http://aspapparel.com/) webstore. 









 I have a couple of friends who work with/for Vice, mainly for their Noisey music segment. I'm also a fan of Molly Crabapple's writing.   

Unfortunately they have some people on staff who think the Church of Satan should jump at the chance to be associated with them. They reached out to the COS, we had some questions and laid out our terms, and they decided to go with some nobody who would be willing to give Vice a song and dance. 




 He was, as my friend [Kenaz Filan](http://kenazfilan.blogspot.com/) puts it, a functional atheist, meaning that he did not operate under the notion that there was any conscious God or gods, he lived his life purely materialistically. His idea of magic was materialistic, *if magic exists* it would one day be explained by science and understood to be part of the human experience, not something supernatural. 




 Essentially, yes. He was open to the possibility that there is a "force" that keeps nature in balance, but this "force" was not something you could communicate with, to pray to or negotiate with. It just is, it doesn't "think", and it surely doesn't give a damn about people. 




 It's important to be clear that the Church of Satan itself does not advocate any one political party/ideology. It encourages each Satanist to seek the politics, if any, that they most agree with themselves and benefits them best. I've met Church of Satan members from all over the political map. and even though they all agree on the principles of Satanism, and may respectfully disagree on how it is applied to politics. 




 Personally, I most closely agree with Ernst Junger's idea of the Anarch, an individualist anarchist/egoist. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarch_(sovereign_individual) 




 Firstly, being an individualist does not mean you're an isolationist. Your self interest comes first and foremost, but you also recognize situations where it would be net beneficial for you, in the short or long term, to cooperate with others.   

There are Satanists who consider themselves Libertarians. You can watch artist Coop (Magister in the Church of Satan) talk about his politics on the Libertarian Reason TV: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy1aC_ltJBs  

LaVey was obviously influenced by Ayn Rand. He promoted her work to other members of the Church of Satan, but there were some clear areas where Satanism and Objectivism diverge. See Magister Nemo's essay: [Satanism and Objectivism](http://churchofsatan.com/satanism-and-objectivism.php).  

The Satanist can also recognize the importance of having a stable environment, where you are free to pursue your happiness, and may choose to dedicate your time and resources to improve your own community. Remember, Satanism does not normalize to society. Satanism does not require everyone to be a Satanist. In fact, Satanism says most people *are not* Satanists. I can see how a Satanist can agree with a centrally planned political system, recognizing the need for people to have their interests taken cared of for them (Socialist, Communist), so long as they place themselves in a position of control of this system. Peter Gilmore writes about this situation in The Satanic Scriptures.  









 Great job! 




 Nailed it 




 Satanism is about living your life happily, rituals should be a tool to help achieve that. Rituals are by and large private, solitary practices. The Black Mass, or Le Messe Noir, as it's referred to in The Satanic Rituals, is just an organized blasphemy, a parody of the Christian mass, or any social institution, and are a means for personally throwing off those shackles. They are very, very rarely public events. The last Satanic High Mass was done on 6/6/6, restricted to verified Church of Satan members, and conducted at the Center for Inquiry West's Steve Allen Theatre in Los Angeles.  
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1zsIk6WcNM 









 The Satanic Bible is the fundamental text for Satanism. This is like going into /r/islam and asking for thoughts on the Koran...   

[Not sure if...](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/t_ku-medium/18nsju2r17odgjpg.jpg)   

Anyway... coincidentally my good friend [Rev. Kevin I. Slaughter](http://www.underworldamusements.net/books/) just posted this [screenshot of the Satanic Bible on Amazon](https://scontent-b-sjc.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-frc3/t1.0-9/10150699_10203710027498322_1300974056_n.jpg) and made this comment a few moments ago that's worth repeating here: 
"A paperback original, published in 1968, is still a bestseller. There has never been a single advertisement placed by the publisher in all that time, there has not been a single "legitimate" review in any major outlet." 




 Love is one of the most powerful human emotions, and it should not be wasted. It should be cherished and applied to the people who would love us back. What is the greater good of humanity? I don't believe in an objective human "greater good", other than living in balance with the natural world. This might not match what other people consider "the greater good".  




 I'll be sure to include your material in one of my upcoming episodes of [Chaos Sedated](http://www.radiofreesatan.com/category/chaossedated/) 




 [Satanic booty had me like...](http://cdn.arwrath.com/1/153259.gif) 




 From the Church of Satan FAQ: http://churchofsatan.com/faq-ritual-and-ceremony.php   

WHAT IS A SATANIC RITUAL?

Greater Magic, which is our name for our ritual practice, is basically meant as self-transformational psychodrama. That is it serves as a means to purge oneself of unwanted emotional baggage that might be hindering a daily pursuit of joy in life. We do not require that anyone accept that it is more than this. The pageantry of ritual is a drama meant for emotional stimulation, not a belief in or worship of any power higher than the projected will of the magician. That is why we call it an intellectual decompression chamber.

The three basic types of Satanic Ritual are outlined in detail in The Satanic Bible, which is essential reading for those wanting to grasp our perspective on this practice. They are for Compassion (for oneself and others), Lust (to release unrequited sexual urges) and Destruction (to cleanse oneself of anger towards someone who has done you an injustice). These serve as models for whatever other purposes one might feel the need to explore via ritual. In The Satanic Rituals Anton LaVey presents other rituals essentially meant for larger group performance based on historical and cultural diabolist imagery.

However, some Satanists also consider the possibility that, through the raising of emotions focused towards a specific achievable goal in ritual, ideas/concepts/images might be transmitted to the minds of other people at a distance, thus perhaps influencing them to make future decisions favorable to the outcome of the situation desired by the magician (transmitter). It then seems to us plausible that there would be a means that is part of nature through which this works. It is not attained through the intervention of supernatural beings, as we do not believe such things exist. The desired goal, what we call an Is-To-Be, would vary based on peoples' ability to transmit as well as receive such images as well as the likelihood of the situation towards which the magician is working.

Rupert Sheldrake, a biologist, has spent many years exploring the extended mind and has solid statistical evidence that there indeed does exist a mechanism in nature that could be used for such ends. His many books are fascinating and worth investigating.

We emphasize that the philosophy of the Church of Satan does not require that our members believe that ritual is more than an emotional experience, nor is there a mandate even to ritualize at all. We simply offer it as a tool for experimentation. Some folks have found results that they feel are beyond coincidence or statistical parameters. Others simply enjoy the release of emotions otherwise hindering their pursuit of personal happiness.

There is no judgment placed on members of the Church of Satan regarding their personal understanding of how ritual functions. One is not more or less of a Satanist based upon his or her evaluation of Greater Magic. See the essay, On the Role of Ritual in the Life of a Satanist by our High Priestess, Magistra Peggy Nadramia, for more information. 




  Order of the Trapezoid

http://www.churchofsatan.com/cos-order-of-trapezoid.php   
  
The Order of the Trapezoid, as a formal organization, was the organization that became the Church of Satan. LaVey was inspired by historical occult orders, but cultivated members who accomplished things in the real world, not people who spent all their time studying occult mumbo jumbo and couldn't get waiter to fill a glass of water.

" In accordance with LaVeys explorations of demonic geometry, they took to wearing an odd-shaped black and red medallion adorned with a bat-winged demon and formed a group called the Order of the Trapezoid, which later evolved into the governing body of the Church of Satan. Those who attended LaVeys soirees always comprised an array of professions and pursuits: the Baroness Carin de Plessenwho grew up in the Royal Palace of Denmark, Dr. Cecil Nixonmagician and eccentric extraordinaire, underground filmmaker Kenneth Anger, as well as artists, attorneys, doctors, writers, and law enforcement officers. City Assessor Russell Wolden might share the room with Donald Werby, one of San Franciscos most influential property owners; anthropologist Michael Harner with writer Shana Alexander. A ships purser might be seated next to a deep-sea diver, a dildo manufacturer next to a plastic surgeon. A famous tattoo artist, the grandson of a U.S. president, the owner of one of the worlds largest collections of Faberg artifactsall attended LaVeys get-togethers. The field of fantasy and science fiction personages alone yielded the likes of Anthony Boucher, August Derleth, Robert Barbour Johnson, Reginald Bretnor, Emil Petaja, Stuart Palmer, Clark Ashton Smith, Forrest J. Ackerman, Fritz Leiber, Jr., to name a few, into LaVeys circle of magical compatriots." 




 There is no such thing as "Generational Satanism" in regards to the Church of Satan. Any "hardcore members" who would believe in that would be swiftly kicked out. 




 Blanche Barton is working on an updated edition which would include an updated bibliography. That's a good question to ask her, I'll forward that along. 
























 No problem. What's are some of your favorites? 









 Representatives put themselves out there not to gain acceptance from the general public, but to defend our rights if we ever see them threatened or to be a beacon for the few others who might share our philosophy. Why bother? I meant what I said in my OP, I did this to have fun and give people the opportunity to interact with a Satanist. All in all I had a good time, talked about music, beer, and Godzilla.   

I agree, evil as some kind of "thing" outside of the human mind doesn't exist. Evil to me anything I don't like. I think all circumstances of child abuse is evil. Children naturally love life, they are in tune with their instincts, they are natural magicians with powerful imaginations. Do I need to defend this? Apparently the Catholic Church doesn't deem child abuse to be evil enough to jeopardize their power.   




 In the context of what he's written later in his life and other books I would think he's being analogous more than anything else.  




 Seems to be a common occurrence, Selim Lemouchi, former frontman of The Devil's Blood (the band that Watain believed could put their Satanism on the cover of Rolling Stone) recently took his own life. Everyone who I know who's worked with Ndtveidt and various other "theistic" Satanists have noticed heavy use of hard drugs. Richard Mills of Grand Belial's Key was a close and personal friend of mine, and though we disagreed on many things (politics, religion, substance abuse), he was a reliable friend to me. Unfortunately one of my last memories of him was when we were hanging out with Absurd and they asked me where I could get drugs. He knew I didn't do drugs, so I got pissed, told them to fuck off and left. A few days later he would die of a drug overdose on the streets of Harlem.  




 We believe that the psychological effects of magic is real, and that, for example, by performing a lust ritual, we are able to increase our chances of having our desired partner, because of an increase in confidence and an alleviation of stress and worry. We are open to the possibility that there may be additional effects to the practice of magic that we do not yet understand. 

"Greater Magic, which is our name for our ritual practice, is basically meant as self-transformational psychodrama. That is it serves as a means to purge oneself of unwanted emotional baggage that might be hindering a daily pursuit of joy in life. We do not require that anyone accept that it is more than this.

 If your six friends bought those certificates in the past... 40 years or so, then yes they were certainly taken for a ride, but not by the Church of Satan. Did LaVey sell certificates at one point or another? I'm not sure, but the only person to claim this (back in the early 70's) was someone who had personal vendetta against LaVey, so I don't take that very seriously. I know I didn't, and none of the Priesthood that I know did, and many of who knew LaVey personally, some since the 80's.

The current administration does not sell priesthood, and will often reject applications and send refunds to people they believe are not fit for the organization (http://imgur.com/r/WTF/E1BPd).  

And about LaVey making a "fortune", I guess it depends on what you mean by fortune. He lived a comfortable life off his royalties (which the COS does not hold, all sales of his books go to his ex partner). Here's a blog entry from writer Kenaz Filan, who's working on an extensively researched, unbiased biography of LaVey and his take on LaVey the money grubbing conman: 

http://kenazfilan.blogspot.com/2013/02/for-chas-clifton-questions-for-devil.html
"But amidst all these allegations I've never seen anyone say that Anton LaVey bilked a nice little old lady out of her life savings.  Or that he took tens of thousands from a bored San Francisco socialite to teach her "the Darkest of Dark Arts." Or that he extorted money from his flock. Or that he ever did any of the things you'd expect a con man to do. "

http://kenazfilan.blogspot.com/2013/01/satanism-story-of-reluctant-antichrist.html   
"Then I saw a throwaway line where LaVey told Lawrence Wright that he hadn't done a Black Mass in over twenty years.  And I realized that here's a guy who could have made a tidy living working the lecture circuit.  Hell, I'm imagining LaVey with robe and hood, holding up a sword and proclaiming  "In this arid wilderness of steel and stone I raise up my voice that you may hear. To the East and to the West I beckon. To the North and to the South I show a sign proclaiming: LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT!!!"   

But he didn't do that.  Instead he watched like Sauron from Barad-Dur as others ran with his ideas (and more often than not got them spectacularly wrong). For a good part of Satanism's story Anton LaVey is conspicuous by his absence. Those aren't the actions of someone who was doing this as a performance, someone who was just looking for a quick buck.  There are many religions founded by conmen pretending to be prophets.  Anton LaVey was a prophet pretending to be a conman. He may have played a little fast and loose with the facts, but he believed everything he said."

 We have some Satanists who are interested in what might be going on and will examine the latest scientific data that could help understand it. Belief in magic beyond psychodrama is not required though, it's up to you and your own experiences to judge that. The rituals, the symbols, the chants and names of the devils are all used to create emotions, stimulate your mind and creativity. Here's some more information, including an interview with Magister Nemo on the role and research on Greater Magic:

 Find out! Another Church of Satan Reverend just reissued the King in Yellow http://www.underworldamusements.net/books/the-king-in-yellow/ 




 Good questions, sorry I missed it earlier.   

I used to be when I was in my teens. I worked for various live venues in NYC and saw many Black and Death Metal bands that I enjoyed. I was into metal before I knew about Satanism as an organized religion. Since I do not have any kind of spirituality, I would say no. I find that heavy metal attracts many young people to Satanism, but many of them get stuck on the basics, the shock value element of it. But I know many mature Satanists today that started out as metal fans; some who still are, others who aren't as much. 

Some favorite metal bands:  
Sunn O))) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rL5Ilyv98c8    
Altar of Plagues http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbfieYwl4aQ   
ISIS http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NT0QL-xrx4
Pig Destroyer http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnymA33eoII
 




 Going through some questions I missed here... I would say that don't have faith, but a worldview and philosophy 1. That we believe in a literal Satan (pretty much covered here) 2. That we're all serious, sullen, metal heads. 3. That we're merely hedonists, all we want is immediate pleasure all the time. We say indulgence, not compulsion. When you feel like you *have* to have pleasure, you're no longer making choices but feeding an addiction. 




 Those anti-christian symbols seem to work well for a number of people, see the popularity of various metal bands (King Diamond) or artists (Coop). Being gaudy about probably won't get you anywhere, have a sense of style and taste and it could work out. Then again, you do away with that all together, use other symbols or archetypes that fit your goals or needs.  




 I would see Jung and his writing on the importance of archetypes, rituals to mark milestones in life, etc. His books are recommended reading for Satanists. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungian_interpretation_of_religion   




 Key terms are *"if you have employed"*, some Satanists are interested in finding out if there's something in the natural world (not spiritual) that could explain magical or psychic phenomenon, and others have no interest in magic other than psychodrama or a form of meditation. 




 I listen to a lot of ambient and experimental music and worked with several record labels that put out that kind of music. See my Chaos Sedated podcast if you're interested http://www.radiofreesatan.com/category/chaossedated/   

But I enjoy many other types of music, from rock to electronic pop music. Here are some songs I've been enjoying a lot lately:  
Ulver: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srImIubSxe8   
ISIS: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWTAkBRe6aI
Monster Magnet: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-mZqUg7lYU  
Crystal Castles: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twG4MTnU8xg
Cold Cave: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRt-IzBXdNY   
Prurient: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meNol8eRwfg
 




 Probably blasting this song in my car http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QbAXXXOJF8 




 I hung out with him on several occasions, did a photo shoot with him in NYC many years ago. We have since parted ways over various differences. He no longer considers himself a Satanist in any way and refers to himself as something like an occult Christian (see the end of his biographical film Iconoclast) 




 LaVey created the above ground, organized religion of Satanism, so I obviously have a lot of respect for him. Yes, I think that TSB is mandatory reading if anyone wants to understand Satanism. 




 Waking up and going to bed with my wife.  




 I'm personally not the biggest fan of heavy metal, but I realize that it attracts many youths to the philosophy. Unfortunately not many get past the shock value and stick to what I consider Phase One Satanist... you know, all black, serious, pentagrams and upside down crosses... But some kids take the ideas and research it it further, find other forms of music and art that have a Satanic element, and develop into more well informed and articulate individuals. Here's a show on Radio Free Satan that focuses on opera and classical music http://www.radiofreesatan.com/category/voxsatanae/ 




 Not familiar with what this talk is, but I'm sure it's a lot of crap... the media just likes to paint anything that looks strange or weird as "Satanic".  




 Not sure which article you're talking about, but LaVey wrote a book called "The Satanic Witch" which was basically a manual for women to use to control men, but also covered the role of sex and gender in general. Here's an article on Satanic Feminism by Blanche Barton, LaVey's last wife and current high ranking COS member http://www.churchofsatan.com/satanic-feminism.php

 Anyone who believes they are able to communicate and gain favor from external deities, whether it's Jesus, Allah, Vishnu, or Satan is delusional in my eyes.  Many of these theistic devil worshippers advocate animal cruelty and acts of crime. 




 here is Magister Nemo talking about Greater Magic. There isn't a front, we're pretty open about what may or may not be possible and the fact that some members believe in magic. That's up you to do decide https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCcYWmeSkCI 




 You can believe what you want, but I've been through all the ranks of the COS and what you see is what you get. There are a few who believe in the power of magic beyond psychology, but they are interested in *possible* scientific explanations. I know many high ranking COS members who do not practice magic at all or purely for psychodrama. And almost none of them take Crowley seriously beyond being a poet and using some useful material for a dramatic ritual. That's it. 




 *Satan* 




 However you want to represent yourself in public is completely up to you, it doesn't make you any more or less a Satanist. I've always enjoyed your responses here, but that's your call.  




 I was in touch with a few of the mods throughout the AMA, they were very helpful and even supported many of my ideas. 




 I actually spoke to the mods and it is recommended to not start responding to questions immediately. I waited about 20 minutes before I started to respond, but my responses were *immediately* getting downvoted below the hidden threshold, so no one was seeing it. The mods were trying to fix this because they noticed a big influx of people (some say an organized Christian group) going to the thread and downvoting everything. About 40 to 45 minutes in my answers started pop up. According to some people I responded faster and more frequently than most celebrity AMA's. 




 "I yam what I yam and tha's all what I yam." If people were going to consider me evil, they should at least be accurate about they think I'm evil for. Maybe I'm evil for being concerned with the planet's environment. Or evil for thinking creationism shouldn't be taught in school. Shock value is important, it wakes people up. Many people can't get past that, but some people get the message and learn to apply what they've discovered about themselves productively in the real world.     




 "I yam what I yam and tha's all what I yam." My views *are* Satanic. Prior to LaVey the term "satanist" or "satanic" was a derogatory term, a way of denouncing a religious or political enemy, or just a general term for blasphemy, not a formulated, structured philosophy or worldview. Catholics called Protestants "satanic" and vice versa. Every so often there would be a Christian heretic who would switch sides, but they still operate under the Christian paradigm. LaVey's goal was take ownership of the term "Satanist", to make it something that stands on it's own, to apply the idea of the "Satanic" not just in terms of opposing spirituality, but in social and cultural institutions that each individual Satanist decides to reject (if any at all). Is this evil? We may disagree but I believe evil is subjective. I think it's evil that we're destroying our planet's environment. I think it's evil to teach creationism in public school. I think child abuse is evil. I have never, in the real world, been considered evil. Well, that's not true. I once got a person fired for sexual harassment and was considered to be evil for ruining someone's life over a misunderstanding. I can live with that. In fact, I can live with being called evil for all sorts of things. But at least be accurate with what you think I'm evil for.   

My end goal is not to help people *in general*, it's to help myself and my loved ones. Sometimes that overlaps with helping others outside of that group. When I advocate for a secular government, sure I'm helping a wide range of religious and nonreligious groups live more comfortably in this country, but that's mainly to protect my own interests. One can expand self-interest outside of immediate rewards. Do you not feel good about helping others? Be honest with yourself, it makes you feel like a better person. That's pride, a sin other religions, not in ours. 




 I can certainly see a Satanist who uses Kali as a metaphor and symbol in their ritual or art in exactly the way you describe. 




 Personally? I believe magic is a way of using symbols and a ritual environment as a form of psychological meditation, focusing on goals, and letting go of emotional baggage. Some Satanists believe there is more to this and they are interested in researching how it can be explained with science and rationality, not spirituality.    
http://churchofsatan.com/faq-ritual-and-ceremony.php 




 Here's more on Satanism, occultism and paganism in general http://churchofsatan.com/faq-occultism-wicca-voodoo.php 




 Most neopagans I've met believe in some form of spiritual karma, that "bad" things will come back to hurt you. It's always appeared to me as basically Christian morals, minus the mythology, add in Mother Earth. I don't claim to be an expert on neopaganism though, and honestly I'm not very interested in it.  




 I meant neo-pagans in general that I've encountered, meant to exclude Asatru from that. 




 I haven't. There's such an overwhelming collection of evidence against the supernatural that I'm very comfortable with my stance.  




 You're underplaying the amount of self satisfaction one can gain from knowing they've improved the world. That is selfish. Everything else follows. That's right, what's right and wrong, beyond the basic doctrines, is up to the individual. If that makes you uncomfortable, that's fine. I don't think everyone is or should be a Satanist or accept Satanism. 




 How so? I've never heard of Mark Passio until right now. He was never the High Priest of anything, and to my knowledge not ever been a member of the Church of Satan. How would you respond to a person who claims to have been the CEO of Google though there's an overwhelming level of evidence to the contrary? Would think this is a sane person?   
http://churchofsatan.com/history.php   

The conspiracy that the Church of Satan is made up of corporate elites has long been debunked. http://www.snopes.com/business/alliance/procter.asp 




 A fulfilling life. Metaphorically our egos live on in the minds of the people we've influenced and inspired. 




 I get to do a great deal of traveling and met some inspiring entrepreneurs in this line of work. It keeps the technical work interesting knowing that the numbers you're working represent cases of booze shipped and sold around the world. I work in data modeling and predictive analysis, which is a hot topic in the business world right now. Lots of small independent IT shops are coming out with their solutions, some are getting bought out by SAP, IBM, Microsoft, etc. The wine industry is very "traditional" in various ways, but they're catching on and adjusting. Here's an article describing the change: http://www.businessinsider.com/big-data-makes-your-wine-taste-better-2013-8 




 No. I do not believe in a spirit or the mind existing outside the body. 




 I don't worship Satan, see my OP. I don't believe in a being called Satan. Satan is a symbol, a representation mans natural instincts. We see our world and society as out of balance, so we take the symbol of the opposer, the enemy, the one who seeks to put things into balance. 




 I was in a bookstore and came across the Satanic Bible. It looked interesting, so I bought it and read it that same day. I agreed with everything in it, it described me and my opinions as if it was written by and old friend. I was about 15 then and I've considered myself a Satanist ever since.  




 Crowley has nothing to do with Satanism, he never called himself a Satanist. He started a religion called Thelema and it's more like Buddhism than anything else.

 I have a couple of Therion albums somewhere, I liked them and will give it another shot. I'll definitely check out that podcast.   

Oh yeah, and check out Dave Ingram's latest band, Down Among The Dead Men.

 1. The Church of Satan isn't interested in becoming a mainstream religion but instead promotes the work the members and maintaining the philosophy of Satanism in general. It's possible that at some point in the future Satanism will be a more understood religion, with more public figures coming out as Satanists. For example, there's Jacob Appelbaum as an open, public Satanist, and he's applied the Satanic sense of freedom to his work at Wikileaks.   

2. I'd like to see it push secularism, but I rather see individuals Satanists advance their goals in the real world than the organization or philosophy itself.

3.  The only political agenda the Church of Satan has is to push for secularism and taxation on all religious organizations, along with some social and cultural programs (total environments, artificial human companions). See here: http://churchofsatan.com/pentagonal-revisionism.php

There are Satanists who are Freemasons, the ideas are not mutually exclusive.   

I'm not a big beer drinker, I prefer scotch. But I recently visited The Lost Abbey brewery and enjoyed their selection. Their Inferno Ale was delicious and I brought home a few bottles! How about yourself? 




 No idea, honestly. I think they like to call themselves Luciferians or Theistic Satanists, but it's inconsistent and usually just whatever that person thinks sounds cool. 




 I spent years going to Coney Island High, The Wetlands, CBGB's and worked with the likes of Deicide, Emperor, Cannibal Corpse, Immortal, Dimmu Borgir, Hate Eternal, Morbid Angel... I'm pretty burnt out on that stuff...  

Nowadays I prefer drones over blast beats.

I'm in the middle of updating Radio Free Satan right now, you might be interested in these shows:  

http://www.radiofreesatan.com/the-metal-grotto-034/   
This month on The Metal Grotto, Citizen JNothing brings you the metal sounds of Goatwhore, Nile, King of Asgard, Death Breath, Entombed, Lazarus AD, Cradle Of Filth (covering a Slayer tune), Erupted, Aeon, Gojira, Psycroptic, and finishes off with some Fecal Corpse.   

Or this one, hosted by Church of Satan member Dave Ingram, former vocalist for Bolt Thrower  
http://www.radiofreesatan.com/metal-breakfast-radio-episode-29-8/   
Back with a bang, or is it a whimper? Either way, we return with a new episode for our lovely listeners, fabulous fans, and the rest of you gorgeous gits. First half sees submitted bands through the sniper's scope - with a surprise money shot at the end. Second half is all about David, since we didn't get to celebrate his birthday properly. He chooses these ones, much to Donovan's chagrin. Or poor taste in music. It's definitely not self-depreciating rubbish. On it you can hear: OBLIVION, EKSPOSISI, SEVERITY, CRYPTIC BLOOD, SLAUGHTERDAY, SERPENT EATER, BLOOD LABEL, MORFIN, SPEWTILATOR, CANCEROUS WOMB, DESTRUCTOR, DISCHARGE, THE ACCUSED, VOIVOD, VENOM, BATHORY, POSSESSED, RAZOR, BOLT THROWER and THE VANDALS.  




 Probably closer to libertarianism. It's a hierarchy. If that scenario provided me with a greater level of satisfaction than pain, or if I personally enjoyed pain, then sure. I don't see that happening for myself. 




 Here's Peter Gilmore on Godzilla  
http://www.churchofsatan.com/godzilla.php  

"Godzilla anthropomorphizes Nature by giving a consciousness to such vast and terrible powers that dwarf us, showing us how truly insignificant we are, personally and as a species. And that such a threat could possibly focus on us intentionally, rather than being something mindlessly passing dreadfully near, amplifies its might. Godzillas presence emphasizes ephemeral humanity." 




 I would consider myself most closely aligned with the Libertarian platform. 




 I never met Zeena but it's pretty obvious that she has an ax to grind against her father. No I don't feel brainwashed.  




 A Priest/Reverend has the authority to speak for the Church of Satan and represent Satanism. The High Priest and Priestess are aware of this thread, I'm in regular contact with them. 




 The Church of Satan actually has a SETI@home team
http://www.churchofsatan.com/cos-seti-team.php   

I'm personally intrigued by the idea of the possibilities of life on other planets and it would help explain our own origins. Our religion seeks to understand the world as it is, within the realm of science, so this is certainly of interest to Satanists. 




 I don't. It's not work, it's an honorary title. 




 We do think of the children... we leave them alone for their parents to deal with. We raise our own children without religion and let them decide what they want to believe when they reach maturity. If a child is in danger I imagine a Satanist would not hesitate to contact the authorities. 
For specifics see this:  http://churchofsatan.com/faq-young-people-satanism.php 




 I think they're delusional at best, potentially criminally violent at worst. 




 Yes, I have it on DVD. 




 It's god damn rainbow coalition! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzlOtvDFjx0 




 You mean, something like, The Satanic Bible? http://www.amazon.com/Satanic-Bible-Anton-Szandor-Lavey/dp/0380015390 




 My favorite metal band would have to be ISIS   
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWTAkBRe6aI feature=kp   

"Satanic" metal isn't really my cup of tea, but I've enjoyed GHOST BC. 




 Mostly electronic music of all sorts. I do an ambient and experimental music podcast here http://www.radiofreesatan.com/category/chaossedated/   

Some recent artists I've listened to: Jesu, Grimes, Youth Code, Boris, Vatican Shadow, Ulver, David E. Williams, Zombi, Godflesh, Dalek, Little Dragon, M83, Zola Jesus, Skream, Burial, Massive Attack   

But I also love soundtrack music, I just ordered a bunch of records from Death Waltz Records: http://deathwaltzrecordingcompany.com/   

 




 Being individualistic does not mean you refuse to work with others. It can mean you only work the those who share your goals. The Church of Satan can provide that network, if you want it. You're not a lesser Satanist if you don't join the organization, and a Satanist can "join" just a form of respect and appreciation and never contact another Satanist.  




 Here's an article by Peter Gilmore dedicated to Godzilla  
http://www.churchofsatan.com/godzilla.php  
"Godzilla anthropomorphizes Nature by giving a consciousness to such vast and terrible powers that dwarf us, showing us how truly insignificant we are, personally and as a species.

 He's got quite the collection of Kaiju toys. Here's his article dedicated to Godzilla http://www.churchofsatan.com/godzilla.php 




 If this occurs after the lifetime of the Satanist then it doesn't negate the satisfaction he or she received in their initial act. 




 If that was an issue I'm interested in fighting against I would condemn the political institutions that protect sex trafficking, including the religious institutions involved in Bacha bazi.   
http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/dancingboys/

I know a couple of Satanist who work with child protective services and counseling, that's another way of applying the Satanic idea of respecting children.  

Here's a book with a collection of stories from Satanic women where all proceeds are donated to The National Violence Against Women Prevention Research Center.

 I have no idea what these groups are. I met Leyba when he first came out with Coyote Satan Amerika. We were in touch for a while, but we had a falling out. Do members leave or get kicked out? Sure, but I'm not seeing anything significant in terms of a "schism".  




 I have no idea what the membership count is, and the Church of Satan does not disclose it. What I do know is that the Central Office is constantly processing memberships, responding to media contacts, and following up with active members.  

There is only one High Priest at any given moment, currently it is Peter Gilmore. Where are you getting these ideas from? LaVey stopped doing public performances in the 70's. He never meant for Satanists to do anything "in the name of the Church" other than apply Satanism in their everyday productive lives. The idea that this somehow "changed" when he died is inaccurate.

Here's a video of the 6/6/6 Satanic Mass.

Here's a video of a lecture at the Maryland Institute College of Art

Here's the successful kickstarter campaign for a Spanish translation of the Satanic Scriptures   
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kevinislaughter/las-escrituras-satanicas-the-satanic-scriptures-in
  
Listen to Magister Coop talk Satanism, art, and rock and roll on WTFPod  
http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_318_-_coop  

The Church of Satan does not see a penny from sales of the Satanic Bible. Royalties of the book go to LaVey's children and his former partner, none of whom are involved with the Church of Satan. 

What's a good pair of shoes run you these days? If $200 is going to break your bank then don't join. The Church of Satan actually rejects applications and refunds money very regularly. http://imgur.com/E1BPd
 




 It doesn't "bother" me, but it's disappointing. It doesn't change anything either way. 




 Seems like Kanye West is wearing clothing from Actual Pain, a clothing label that uses Satanic and other occult imagery. http://lineout.thestranger.com/lineout/archives/2011/02/25/kanye-in-actual-painactual-pain-in-cross  

I was walking around the shops in LA a few weeks ago and noticed an increasing amount of Satanic imagery in high fashion shops. My wife picked up a few pieces she found interesting. I think this part of what makes True Detective such a hit show right now. If this trend means I get better TV to watch, my wife gets sexy clothes, and I can get vinyl reprints of horror movie records then I'm happy. 




 1. Kooks come in all shapes and colors. Not worth your time trying to sort him out.   
2. I've encountered a number of drugged addicted morons in metal bands who think they're in communication with demons. I quickly distance myself from anyone like that. 




 Had a decent enough time with this, even answered some fun and thoughtful questions.  




 Good is what I like, evil is what I don't like. You're assuming that "good" comes from a divine source, that is a first principle I do not accept so everything from that point cannot be reconciled.  




 Here are some more answers

 Never been a fan of either! Well before my time, both of them! 




 1. Most Satanists I know believe in subjective morality. We a few baseline morals (more like guidelines) but beyond that we are left to decide and incorporate any moral system that best suits us.  
2. Yes, I'm an atheist. What is Christian morality? It was once moral for Christians to own slaves and kill their children. Obviously this doesn't apply today (for the most part...) but that would mean Christian morality is subjective to the cultural norms of the the time. I'm open to the debate that certain morals are consistent throughout cultures because they establish a basis for civilization and is innate. See the Wason selection task.  
3. Most Satanists I know could be described as social liberals and fiscal conservatives, or just plain Libertarians. I know one who considers himself borderline socialist, and others who have no political interest at all. The only political agenda that the Church of Satan works towards is secularization of the state and taxation on all religious institutions.   
4. There are no "meetings." Many Satanists are performers, artists, musicians, and writers and the Church of Satan will promote the concerts and events of these people that's what they want. At those events other Satanists who share those interests might show up. But Satanists have a wide range of interests, so it's not some universal gathering.  
5. A priest does not have a "function", it's just an honorary title that means the Church of Satan approves of me representing the Satanic philosophy in public *if I choose to do so*.    
6. I put up a tree, send greeting cards to friends and family, and exchange gifts. I prefer to refer as Yule. Here's the latest Yule greeting from the Church of Satan http://churchofsatannews.tumblr.com/post/70660015798/superlative-solstice 




 Yes, that was one of my events! Blood Axis, Changes, and Dream Into Dust. At the time I was part of TESCO USA. You probably saw me there, and that was the same bar I had drinks with Peter Gilmore at. Did you enjoy the performance? If you're interested in more of the same follow me on Twitter, I'll be doing another event in NYC in October. https://twitter.com/InvisibleWar 




 Odinism can be seen as a noble form of Satanism. I'm close friends with several Satanists who use Norse gods for their symbolism.  




 If working towards a better tomorrow gives a Satanist personal satisfaction today then this is very much in-line with our selfish philosophy. 




 http://churchofsatan.com/satanism-and-objectivism.php "We do not hold, as do the Objectivists that the universe is benevolent. Satanists view the world as neutral, beyond the concepts of benevolent or treacherous, good or evil. Satanism enables the Satanist to codify his life beyond the ethical and metaphysical straightjacket which Objectivism unfortunately offers. This is not written to attack Objectivism but merely to clarify the areas of difference.

Satanism drew from Objectivism as even Rand drew from others. Both are, however, unique. Both are different from the other." 




 By achieving real world accomplishments. 




 I have this on VHS! 




 Much of this has been answered here http://www.reddit.com/r/tabled/comments/1zgfeg/table_i_am_a_priest_in_the_church_of_satan/  

http://churchofsatan.com/theory-practice.php 




 1. No, we do not believe in any supernatural forces. http://churchofsatan.com/faq-fundamental-beliefs.php

2. I've never had an issue.  
3. We don't meet as an organization, but some Satanists will support the concerts, events, art galley openings of other Satanists who share their interests.  
4. My birthday.  




 http://churchofsatan.com/faq-fundamental-beliefs.php 




 No. 




 I can't say that "love our fellow man". I think people need to earn my love, and doesn't come easy. That doesn't mean I'm not polite or respectful in public. We do not advocate human or animal sacrifice of any kind and will promptly report people to the authorities if we get any sign of that.
