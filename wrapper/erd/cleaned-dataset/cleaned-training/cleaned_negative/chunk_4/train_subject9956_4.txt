 I'd argue it is very hard growing up in Western culture and not know anything about religion. 




 I would have no problem with religion if people wouldn't believe it. 




 Of course there is a heat shield,I forgot to mention it. 




 Good idea, thanks 




 I am currently designing a lightweight escape pod for two Kerbals, basically seats on a cubic strut with a parachute with fairings (but I don't think they're necessary now). now I have to just solve the stabilization during activating small separating boosters, because it tends to spin instead of keep firing retrograde. 




 You did good. Some people created a dumbfuck religion out of it and try to make it last as long as possible - blame them for that we do not know yet what happens.

 As Cooper is falling in the black hole (or is it already *somewhere else*?) we can see he is falling towards [a spherical structure](http://i.imgur.com/vFciagz.jpg). Given his relative size to [the space of the tesseract](http://i.imgur.com/LD4OvfQ.jpg) and assuming a "chamber" in there is taken as a cubic space with every side being one clearly visible rectangle (or mabe rather the dimensions of Murph's room), I'd assume it could be estimated how many "chambers" there were, but I can't do the math. 




 "Probably a dozen times since their deaths I've heard my mother or father, in a conversational tone of voice, call my name. Of course they called to me often during my life with them  to do a chore, to remind me of a responsibility, to come to dinner, to engage in conversation, to hear about an event of the day. I still miss them so much that it doesn't seem at all strange that my brain will occasionally retrieve a lucid recollection of their voices."

Just thought it would be nice to point it out, since Google search turns out twisted versions of this quote. 









 For me it is a horrible/overly complex UI. That is the reason why I do not play many strategies/MMOs, I just want to have fun without having to learn what all buttons do and so on. But if I immediately think the game is worth it, of course I can sacrifice the time learning it. 




 One of my cats purrs very easily and so I can clearly hear changes in purring, and I noticed about 3 "levels" of purr she gives off depending on the amount of her satisfaction and contentment. The usual purr can then be accompanied by a "deeper" purr or even another sound. 



















 be overtaken by the tree roots and change back into the library? Because we all know in our hearts that the tree was, is, and ever will be only true home, right?

Also, please someone make a gif of Harry rocking Fluttershy (I don't know how to make gifs), that was cuteness overload. hnnnnnnng

It is mindboggling that it is not funded more. 




 Almost all of my EPL bases are on planets (and one is in orbit above Kerbin), but I haven't as of yet tried to make a functional base on an asteroid. I am not sure if it can be mined without additional plugins (and screw realism, infinite fuel asteroid deposit ftw). Can it? 





























 I have built a base on Duna, but I can't get the converter to convert. There is everything - drill, karbonite tanks, pipes and so on - but the damn thing is stubborn as Jeb. I have tried various pipe flows but it doesn't help. Isn't there a mod which makes it work automatically?

 I want to buy it, but I am not sure about this. 




 I saw some bottles of cider in Tesco and thought it would be nice to drink some again, so I bought a few, but it gave me 
tummy ache and a little bit of diarrhea and I was lying in bed all day. Is cider supposed to do that? Poor Applejack. 





























 I remember nothing else about it, but I saw it maybe 15 years ago 



















 Hi, just a quick question, in some games (currently Just Cause 2) VLC's global keybinding doesn't work. I like to listen to my music instead of in-game music and while it is just a matter of alt-tabbing for 2 secs to make it work and then going switching back to the game, it disrupts the experience. Does anyone know a solution? 
























 I mean, it is fun to have your rovers jumping, tubmling and exploding, but if you seriously need to get somewhere far it is a nightmare, as the rover easily slides. Is there a mod which improves that? 







































 Firstly, some of you may criticize me for this, but I mean no harm - I was browsing FB and look at some dude's profile and there was [this photo](http://i.imgur.com/Zp0JW6k.jpg) of him with his girlfriend. It made me happy for them.

Most people would consider them rather... not pretty, but they don't mind. They found each other, and you can really see their happiness. There is hope for every one of us. 












































 It has this adventurous feel, almost nostalgic. Why is it so obsure, I heard about this twice (the first time I forgot about it). 









 I just saw a ultrasound photo on my feed from my other cousin. 














 The other day I bought a carrot and when I turned a corner to a dark alleyway it hopped out of the bag, pushed me on the ground and brutally beat me up while laughing evily. 







































 In Pale Blue Dot Carl mentions his colleague who visited New Guinea highlands and found a tribe that was ignorant about technology but not about the Moon landing and the astronauts. I googled, but I can't seem to find what tribe it was. Can you help me? 
































































 As of now, shockwaves are only a visual effect and I think that's a pity. It wouldn't have to create a chain reaction, just disassemble things in proximity and push them away (or just push away if more distant). I kind of miss this feature. I googled but to no avail. 









 I built an EPL base on Minmus, but I cannot use it properly because there are two fuel ducts endpoints above the launchpad left over from positioning it and they clip with vessels and fuck shit up. Can't grab them and I doubt I can shatter/smash them with robotic arms. I set up a second launchpad, but I don't want to abandon this one.

[Look](http://i.imgur.com/MEQLMqd.jpg) 









 Upon "finishing" my 0.90 career mode, I started a new game with a couple of other mods, namely Karbonite, Extraplanetary Launchpads, and SCANSat so I try building fully self-sufficient bases elsewhere and explore the system more easily.

I have finally understood how those work, but I am having problems setting the SCANSat big map to the resources mode. It just still displays altitude map. I have sent a probe with both Magnetometer and SAR detector in a polar orbit of Minmus (I don't know whether SCANSat detector is enough). Do I have to activate the magnetometer? It didn't show the option before activating the detector, but activating the detector keeps my energy drained at 0.01, so I have no way to check, because it won't let me.

 


































 I fail to see any reason why it would not be possible, but I haven't tried it yet. The transfer rates should be high enough for it to function. 




 There was a scheduled whatnot with the central heating in our building, he was one of the workers that came here. I did not expect that at all, I was in a bad mood and it made me very happy to see him. I love meeting my old friends. :')

 Specifically, I think of how much would Sun bulge if it was orbiting the Earth and not the other way around. 



















 Often I have problems with the scale of this game and I think "Wait, real galaxies have fucking lots of stars, but it can't be this much.". I am in disbelief when I fly across any galaxy.
