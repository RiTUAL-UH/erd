 Through the scriptures. They resonated with me in a way that was only explainable as Divine. Their truth grappled with my heart and left my walls of excuse broken. 




 Because he has enabled me to. Salvation was all his work, I had no part in it. He awakened my heart and drew me to himself. I could never have been "convinced", it was all his doing.

 




 Yes, absolutely brilliant.

Blood Meridian is my favorite. 




 *All the pretty horses* by Cormac Mccarthy 




 Get involved in a community organization. Seriously, you would be surprised how many friends you make by volunteering.  




 Kind of. Except I could be a hippie with a beard and nobody would care.

Plus, highschoolers might be actually smarter than Army privates. 




 1. More time with my family. I am ready to plant roots in the north Alabama hills, buy a little land, get some chickens and sheep, get involved in my community,never move away again.

2. I just got tired of the Army running every aspect of my life. I understand it, I don't hate it, I just am ready to move past it.

3. No. 

4. Yes, I have a railroad job lined up and I am going to use my G.I. Bill to go back to school at UAB, get my teacher certification, and teach some high school kids. 




 Anything by Sondre Lerche. 




 Obviously this is a subjective question.

I don't believe the point of religion is "getting back to God" or "helping your fellow man", though those are two admirable things.

I believe the point of religion is to properly serve our Creator according to His holy Law. It is not about a unification of consciousness or altruism, it is about complete obedience to our Sovereign King. 

 




 I meant to say state action in the marketplace. My mistake.

Because I believe I should be allowed to work for however much or little I want. If I choose to accept conditions below minimum wage, that is my business. I have in the past worked for low wages, and would again. I don't like the state telling me what I must work for. I also don't like the state pretending to be my nanny. I believe as an individual I have the right to agree to any contract I want. It is not the state's business what I choose to work for. 

If a union wants to argue with an employer about wages, that is their business. I don't care what they do. Everyone in that union has the right to free association, and if they can strike or whatever to get the employer to agfee to their contract that is all fine. I don't believe it is ever the state's job to intervene though. The state should enforce contracts, not make contract demands. It is the individual's (or group of individuals') responsibility and right to make any contract they are willing to agree to.

Since I believe life begins af conception, I believe abortion is an act of aggression against a human life, which I would never support under any circumstance. Violence should only be used in defense and never aggression.

I am a libertarian laissez faire capitalist. I believe the markets should be free from state control. I did not come here to egg on a political discussion though, that was not the intent of my OP. 




 Well I am not a union member, and won't ever be.

My question was not about a personal curcumstance though.

In some states it is nearly impossible to work in the blue-collar career you are skilled in without joining a union.

I have nothing against the idea of unions, I think everyone should be allowed to associate with whomever he or she chooses. I just do not know of any unions that operate from my perspective, and I would not want to join an organization that runs counter to my ethos. 




 Well thanks for your explanation, I appreciate your perspective. 




 For example, if a union decided to strike for employers to provide birth control coverage to employees, including abortion, I would be against the morality of those benefits.

Since I am also against minimum wage laws, I would not strike to raise minimum wage. 

Since I believe state action is immoral, I would not strike to enact state change. 




 Hmmm, we didn't. We shot slick for familiarization, but not qual. 




 You win.

Pushing now.

Climb to glory. 




 We are hot shit. 

Do pushups. 




 Weird..  




 You did not do it in basic and AIT? 




 How are you in the Army and now is your first time shooting in an IOTV? 




 I can understand your reasoning. I am not in a union job, but I am in a job that requires me to be in an organization where we actively lay our lives down for the guy to our left and right. I understand being a part of an organization that is equatable to family, the reason for the OP is just me trying to get my head around one thing ( I am honestly not trying to say this like a jerk)

My brothers woukd never ask me to stop working under threat of eviction from the organization, even though our benefits and workplace can be crappy as well. I just cannot understand being forced to participate in that because an organization has a monopoly on that trade. 




 I agree with what you are saying. Unions are important, and I am all for people joining unions. The area about this issue I am curious about is what does one do if they are in a state where they have to join a union to work a specific job? They cannot leave the union unless they want to lose their job, move, or face legal action, yet they disagree with the strike issues?


 




 *Lone Survivor* and *American Sniper* are the only two I have read. They were ok. I have been to Afghanistan, and approaching them with firsthand experience gave me a bit more appreciation than I might have before.

I would not place it on a top ten military books list.


My personal favorite is *We Were Soldiers Once, and Young* by Hal Moore. 




 What if I disagree with the union about the morality of the benefits rhey represent? 




 But in a non-right to work state, would I have to quit my job? 




 What happens if my union is on strike, and I disagree and refuse to strike, and instead go to work? I am especially curious how this works in a job where union membership is mandatory? 




 What happens if my union is on strike, and I disagree and refuse to strike, and instead go to work? I am especially curious how this works in a job where union membership is mandatory? 




 Probably just a publisher misprint. 




 "Bubba".

My little sister could not properly say "brother". It stuck. 




 There are several reasons

1. Because Jesus Christ is fully God, and we are forbidden from making images of God.

2. Because it is impossible for finite men to draw one Person with two natures ... the picture will be heretical.

3. Because Jesus Christ has ascended with a glorified body. We have no way of picturing the Risen Christ.

4. Any picture of Jesus we make will be a fashioning of his appearance by us, not as God revealed, for we don't know what Jesus looked like.

5. You need to contemplate God to draw Him, and we can't contemplate without owing worship. So, we either fail to revere God or we worship Him by image.

6. Because God is spirit, and this cannot be captured by a picture. 




 There is no wiggle room. In relation to your first quote, we consider the standards *goodband necessarily deduced from scripture.*.

Your second quote proves my point. It says that the circumstances regarding the worship and order of God's church *according to the general rules of the Word, which are always to be observed*

Read section XXI. That is where the RPW is explicitly stated thusly

T*he acceptable way of worshipping the true God is instituted by Himself, and so limited by His own revealed will, that He may not be worshipped according to the imaginations and devices of men, or the suggestions of Satan, under any visible representation, or any other way not prescribed in the holy Scripture.*
 




 I did not mean we don't need any recruits. 

I meant it in the sense thst we are not lacking in possible recruits. There are a thousand others who will join anyways, without tattoos, and the Army is still cutting.

My point; this is a garrison Army. We aren't fighting OEF and OIF anymore. They have no interest in loosening up the rules. 




 I would not say more... or less.. I like spending time with people based on many attributes, whether they are gay or straight has no relevence on how relaxed I would be.

I know gay people who are obnoxious as hell.

I know straight people who are obnoxious as hell.

I know gay people who are mature andi enjoy being around.

I know straight people who are mature and I enjoy being around. 




 It doesn't matter if it is religious patriotic etc. If your tattoo below your elbow is larger than your hand, you are out.

Do you think the military really needa recruits? They are cutting our numbers all the time. We don't need recruits badly. So no, they are not going to be lax on tattoos. If anything, they are only going to get stricter. 




 Sometimes we have stained glass as an aesthetic thing, but they never have images of Christ. Usually they are landscapes or some other artistic design. 

We sing only Psalms in worship, our ministers usually wear black Geneva gowns 




 Because I believe there is no biblical precedent for seeking God through images. Also I believe the Law still demands us to refrain from any images in our worship.

 




 Morality is determined by obedience to God. My fsith defines morality by God's law.

It is very human to define morality by how we relate to other humans. God demands us to judge our morality by our relationship with him. 




 Both.

I believe it is a mockery and is disrespectful to Christ. The example of portraying Christ as a white man is one example. It is also blatant disrespect to assume that sinful man can even come close to depicting a perfect God.

It is also morally wrong in the sense that God, in Holy Scripture, directly forbids it. Therefore it is a direct act of mutiny against His holy law.  




 Both. It saddens me to see Him disrespected in a way that he specifically forbid us to do. It also saddens me to see folks overlook the seriousness of this action, and saddens me for their wellbeing.

I don't think this is a "heaven or hell" issue. One can be a Christian and still break the second commandment, but that does not mean it carries no rebuke. 




 Yes, we do take a sola scriptura view of scripture. 

I understand the theological justification behind iconography, but we reject it.

No, I do not think you are going to hell. I imagine we disagree on a good many things though. 




 It upsets me at all times, I believe it to be very wrong.

If you are asking if it angers me in a way similar to the Charlie Hebdo incident angered some extremists... absolutely not. I would never take aggresive violent action because of such a thing.

I do believe it is morally wrong, and folks who participate in it will have to answer to God for it. If it happened within my denomination I would bring the issue before our leadership and expect disciplinary action. 




 Some of us do.

I am a Reformed Presbyterian. It is **strictly** forbidden in our denomination. We do not allow images of any person of the Godhead in any scenario, ever. 

Not in our homes, not in our church, not on our facebook page, never  




 Exactly.

Having a contract forced upon you without the option to determine your own contract rules is slavery. 




 It also violates the concept of free association.

Free individuals choose their contracts, servants have their contracts forced upon them 




 Our church name is a decriptor that refers to our form of government.

We do not believe the Westminster Standards are extrabiblical. They introduce no new doctrine. Every point of the Standards is from scripture. They are simply a concise and homogenous guide to explain Scripture.

We are so strict on them to prevent division. If you want to have your own varied views on scripturex go ahead, but to be a Presbyterian you have to agree with our standards totally. If a church or elder in our presbytery wants to stop being Calvinists, or refute paedobaptism, or teach something different than the standards, we have grounds for discipline. It is easy and simple.   




 Yes. We are strictly bound by the Book of Church Order with regards to those things. The BCO operates with the Regulative Principle as it's foundation. We do not operate congregationally, we have a plurality of elders because we believe that is the example of scripture, there is no other option. There is only one way we do things. We have a presbytery with authority to exercise oversight over local churches because we see that in scripture.

 




 It is a revolving line of funding from Congress given to veterans as repayment for their service. I am not getting benefits just because I am a human and "deserve" it. I am getting those benefits because I am contractually entitled to those benefits.

If I agree to exchange my service for "X" product, and itbis included in a contract, after my service is completed I am entitled to that product. That is the premises of free trade. 

I defend freedom. I do not defend anyone being "owed" anything just because they are human.  




 That applies specifically to worship. The Sabbath is the Lord's day and we believe in only worshipping him his way on the Lord's day.

We do believe there are many areas left to Christian liberty in private life (alcohol, smoking, etc) 




 By we, I mean all EP Reformed Presbyterians. I can speak for all Exlusive Psalmody Presbyterians because we have very strict confessions which we subscribe to. We do not allow deviation from the Westminster Standards. 

All of us believe exactly the same on everything in the confession. We do not believe in individual interpretation. 

Some confessional presbyterians deviate very slightly from exclusive psalmody and allow hymns as well. Nonetheless, even they would be *very* strict about what is allowed in worship.

We do not use instruments in worship. There is some debate about the use of instruments within the RP camp, but my particular group does not.



 




 Yes.

We believe the state has no say in marriage.

Your religion is free to define marriage however they like, but they cannot force those beliefs on others.

So we believe the Catholic church has the right to not define same sex marriages as valid in their religion, but they cannot stop unitarians from marrying the same sex. 

 




 We believe that verse us referring to various *kinds* of Psalms (i.e. Psalms, Psalms of adoration, and Spiritual Psalms.)

The fundamental issue that guides our view of worship is the Regulative Principle of Worship. We believe if Scripture does not command something in worship, it is forbidden. 




 Libertaran here.

I would not say Pres. Obama is a socialist, he is a progressive democrat. 

We disagree on the role of the state. We believe the markets should be free, and nobody should be forced to pay for other's welfare. We believe welfare should be accomplished through voluntary association (i.e. charity, relgious organizations, and non-profits.) We believe the state should not force contracts on people. It is up to each individual to negotiate and decide what contract he is willing to work for (or join a union voluntarily to band together to bargain collectively). 

There are some things I do agree with progressives on. For example, open borders, drug legalization, marriage equality etc.

Libertarians and Republicans are *nowhere* near alike.  




 I never once said homosexuality was worse than other sins.

I did say that living in blatant sin (in any area) is not a mark of a true Christian. 




 I earned my college and my paycheck because they were both part of the wages in the contract I agreed to. It was not given to me. I gave services in exchange for thst G.I. bill, as it was stated in my contract. In my contract it specifically said I would give my services in exchange for both a monetary wage and other benefits, including a G.I. Bill, 

It was not a gift, it was income for my services.

You paid for my college because I worked a job to defend you. Your tax money did not give me anything that I did not earn. 




 There is no such thing as a free lunch. The money will come from taxpayer pockets. 

As a veteran, I worked hard to *earn* my college benefits. I put blood, sweat, and tears into my job so that I could go to college on the government's dime. Now we just wanna give that to every kid on the street... It devalues what I worked so hard for. 

If you want to go to college, you have to earn it. Through the military, through academic application, through employment programs, through any way you can. I am not of the breed of folks who believes you deserve free college just because you can eat, sleep, and piss. 
 




 I am not a Republican so I can not attest to every motive of theirs.

I disagree with them on a good many things, including immigration, drugs, gay marriage, etc. 

 




 That has nothing to do with it. 

The point is that I, and many others like me, just want to be left alone. We do not want anyone making our decisions for us (good or bad). I own myself. I work for what I choose.

I would argue that viewing the government as a benevolent organization that only wishes you good is a very uninformed and foolish way to view the world. 

It has nothing to do with the government being out to get me. It is the fact that they will not allow me to make my own decisions. They won't let me decide what is best for me. The state is not my mommy. I can choose for myself.  




 I believe in bettering the world we live in through voluntary action and free choice, not through the government trying to do it through force.

What kind of world would it be if the government told me what I was allowed to work for? Am I not an individual? Why should they force me to accept their conditions? I want nothing to do with them, yet they are going to force me to work for 7 paid sick days, thus removing yet one more thing that might distiguish me from other job applicants.

I say leave me the hell alone. What benefits I choose to work for is none of their damn business. If someone else wants 7 paid sick days, 15 dollars an hour, etc, they can go find that job. If I am willing to work for less, with no sick days, why shouldn't I be allowed to? 




 The point is we do not believe it is the state's job to demand what an employer and employee agree to in a contract. 

We like the government out of our business. I don't want them making my employer give me days ofd, I don't want them telling me what benefits I have to work for. It is my business and my business alone what contract I choose to accept.

Perhaps agreeing to work for less sick days makes me more marketable to employers? I am willing to work for zero paid sick days if it makes me more competetive in the job market. 




 They are against the government forcing businesses to give folks sick 7 days of leave.

As a Libertarian, I am against this too.

 




 He is speaking to the combined houses of Senate and Congress.

He is basically giving them an assessment of the current "state" of the "union" (United States).

Traditionally it was a way for the President to report to the legislative branch ow the nation was doing.  




 More Psalms.

We only use Psalms in corporate worship. So in a corporate worship context, all other types of music are irrelevent to me.

Other types of Christian music are nice for the car though.  Take notes from Red Mountain Music and the Gatsbys. 




 Neither.

It leans communistic still, but the markets are not totslly stste controlled. There is some competition and freedom allowed.

They are a mixed system, just like pretty much every other nation's economic system in one way or another. 




 [Here is a link for you](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/passports/information/where-to-apply.html) 




 If you are celibate, then yes.

If you are engaging in sexual relations with the same sex... Maybe. Let me explain. 

Christians can sin. If you are a Christian, and are attracted to the same sex, and slip and have sexual relations, you do not lose your salvaion or anything. 

If you are living a life of outright noncelibate same sex relations, that is not an indicator of discipleship. True disciples do not live in blatant sin for extended periods of time.

I take the traditional and orthodox stance that same sex relations are a sexual sin, just like adultery, lust, sex outside of marriage etc. A Christian can slip and be involved in any of those sins. A Christian cannot live a life of blatant disobedience in any of those areas for an extended period of time. 




 I have seen the term thrown around a bit, but I have no clue what it means. Can someone break it down for me? Also, is there any divide between traditional libertarian thought and paleolibertarian thought? 




 Ah. I would venture to say they fit into the latter category. 

Probably not, as long as you don't challege their prosperity gospel. 




 I would like to see myself owning several acres of property, operating a little farm. I would love to be surrounded by children and grandchildren. I cannot wait to see how much more I love my wife the older I get. I am gonna be a cardigan wearing, pipe-smoking, scotch drinking old veteran. (I know this because I am a cardigan wearing, pipe-smoking, scotch drinking *young* veteran). I would like to be well travelled. I would like to continue my travels as an old man, with my wife.  




 Where do you see yourself as an old man? Just curious if any of y'all ever think about this? 




 Depends. 

In a few pentecostal type churches they have bishops in the traditional diocesian sense.

Oftentimes they see the word bishop as interchangable with elder or pastor. Many times they are ordained by their denomination.

Others are ordained by no one. Oftentimes these are the ones who open up their own "worldwide ministries" operating as entrepreneurs peddling Christendom to whoever they can. 




 Neither, I am a Libertarian. 

Because I believe in social *and* economic liberty. 




 You are right about that! Those days are over too. I just picked up my 5. Now I am the private of thr NCO corps. 




 Absolutely. I took full advantage of my private status. 

Now those days are gone and when I get in trouble, i can no longer say "I'm a private" as an explanation. 




 In 1 Cor. 7 verse 12 and on Paul says that a husband/wife who is married to a non-believer should not seperate from them. 

The fundamental principle would apply in your scenario as well. 




 For example Russian Orthodox, Antiochian Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Greek Orthdox etc. From what I understand they are merely cultural divisions, but what actually makes these variants unique from each other? Also, in the US do Russian, Greek, and Oriental Orthdox churches all follow under the OCA? 




 Best news sources I would recommend.

Reuters.

BBC.

NPR

 




 The seventh day was not a day spent creating anything. The world was complete by the end of the sixth day. The seventh was the day of rest, the initiation of the Sabbath pattern. 




 This. 




 I like it. I will soon be transitioning from my current career into another.

I love stability. I love knowing where I am going, and seeing myself move from a kid with no skills to a grown man moving in a bright direction. 




 I will refer you to my confession. 

[Article IV of the WCF](http://www.reformed.org/documents/wcf_with_proofs/index.html?body=/documents/wcf_with_proofs/ch_IV.html) I believe in a literal six day creation. 




 Good. Not LHBC Milk Stout Nitro, but enjoyable nonetheless. 




 Our view is the same view Calvin adhered to about Sola Scriptura. It has historical precedent. 




 Again, we are not participating in any worship. We are enjoying a cultural holiday with neutered cultural symbols. Culture determines what symbols relate to false gods. Nobody in our culture associates anything on these holidays with pagan gods (except fringe groups)
 




 Reformed Presbyterian here.

We don't believe you can come to God any way exceot through the word revealed in Scriptures. The Scriptures are the only revealed word of God. The Scriptures are the complete word of God. There is no other revelation at all. Since we are staunch adherents to the RPW, we allow nothing j  worship that is not commanded in Scripture. No outside traditions. No images, no human written songs (I am Exclusive Psalmody), no church calender etc. 

That is what we mean by Sola Scriptura. It is not that the Scruptures are the highest revelation of God among many, we beleieve the Scriptures are the **only** revelation of God at all. (In an immanent sense). 




 Obviously the LOTR. 

I liked the Elven appearances in *Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norell* by Susanna Clarke 




 The Name of the Wind series by Patrick Rothfuss

The Mistborn series by Brandon Sanderson.

The Boneshaker Series by Cherie Priest.

The Leviathan series by Scott Westerfeld 




 If I use thst logic I should not use regular names for days (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday etc), or teach my children the names of planets (Mars, Jupiter), or hve them read any litersture besides Scripture..

Paul was very schooled in the Pagan Greek poets, and Greek philosophy and rhetoric. He was familiar with the Olympic sports (hardly a Christian institution). There is value to culture and cultural identity. We do not allow that cultural heritage to influence our worship. 

See Paul's argument for food offered to idols in 1 Cor 8. I would place cultural celebrations in this category.  




 Reformed Presbyterian here.

We acknowledge the paganistic core of these holidays, and therefore do not acknowledge them as Christian. If you go to our churches on Easter Sunday or the Sunday after Christmas, it will be no different than any other Sunday.

Usually we celebrate them as fun cultural holidays, but we place *zero* religious significance in them.

I cannot speak for the rest of Christendom.


**Edit;** Also, we don't use holy water, symbols, images, or any other such thing in worship.  




 [The Road to Middle-Earth; how J.R.R. Tolkien created a new mythology](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/564204.The_Road_to_Middle_Earth?from_search=true) by Tom Shippey


He assesses the influences and themes of Tolkien's mythology, noting especially the philiological themes of the works. 




 Because cars were a status symbol. 

Today just about everyone has cars. If I took a picture to prove I had a car, you would not care. I think you already assume I have a car.  




 I am a Reformed Presbyterian looking to better understand EO history and thought? Can someonr recommend some good introductory (but not dumbed down) books to the EO world? 




 I listened to that article on NPR, and I think it is one of the best standalone stories supporting prison libraries. That is actually wht got me searching for information on prison libraries (which led me to the NYT article). 




 I am sorry, it was my misunderstanding. 




 My wife and I are set on homeschooling our children. Can y'all recommend some books about homeschooling? I am looking for anything about why you should homeschool, how to start homeschooling, any of your favorite books dealing with the subject.

I would also appreciate some memoirs of folks who did homeschooling/were homeschooled. 




 Yes, the PCA holds to the Canons of Dordt. (TULIP).

They are staunchly Calvinists. 




 Depends on which Presbyterian Church. 

The PCUSA is pretty liberal. There are a few conservatives left. 

The PCA and OPC are the largest confessional denominations. They are strict calvinists. 




 Cool, I was there too

March 2011- March 2012

November 2013- July 2014 




 Yeah, not a sports guy either. I have better things to do with my time. 




 Which conflict? 




 I am gonna have a glass after dinner. It was recommended by my (very knowledgable) local beer guy. I am a *huge* fan of stouts. So far Left-Handed Milk Stout Nitro is my very favorite beer. 

What do y'all think of Bell's? Where does it fit on the stout spectrum? 




 Yup. I think there is a big difference between healthy assertiveness/confidence and alpha-male overcompensation. 




 For myself, I would say yes. 

I work a manual job (the military), keep my hair short, dress very old school, enjoy mostly masculine type hobbies (wood working, hunting, fishing etc). I tend to be *very* conservative in my behavior (not exactly in my politics though).

I also like cooking, and do my share of the cleaning, but I don't see those as feminine exlusive activities. 




 Basically, would you say your definition of masculinity/male roles is traditional or not? Do you fit into the traditional parameters of masculinity or not?

I am *not* asking whether you think all men should be restricted to traditional gender roles, I am just curious in what ways you personally fit into traditional masculinity, and what ways you do not. 




 I dunno. I have never been that kind of guy. I don't put my hands on other dudes, don't hug other dudes, and don't pretend flirt with other dudes. 




 They tear you down as a human being. The point is to root out all individuality. You no longer own yourself. You are not unique. You do not do what you want. Your life belongs to your brothers. 

Then they build you back up. They give you a new identity as a team member, a uniformed person who has voluntarily surrendered all selfexpression in order to live a lifestyle of absolute conformity. 




 I am definitely not opposed to reading it. I enjoy reading many things outside my perspective. 




 So you support the release of the Guantanamo Bay inmates but oppose free exchange of ideas for them? Interesting. How do you reconcile those two things?


I also support the closing of Gitmo, but I was just curious if in the meantime, y'all found the library important? 




 Not just my congregation. This issue is fundamental to Reformes Presbyterians throughout history. Calvin, Knox, the Westminster Divines, the Covenanters, all saw this as a first tier issue. 

My entire historical line is one if Penal Substitutionary Atonement advocates.
 




 Mead is closer to wine than beer. 




 My church would disagree. This is an issue we see as fundamental to Christian fellowship. A first tier issue. 




 Yes, it is changing. I was just explaining why such a divide has existed in the past. 




 A lot of it is culture. In American culture, beer has been associated with masculinity, especially blue collar masculinity. In the past it was frowned upon for women to drink beer. 

 




 I don't think they are heretics. That is a strong word. It refers to the denial of some fundamental doctrine of the Christian faith (i.e. the Trinity, Divinity of Christ, Substitutionary atonement etc)

I don't approve of many of their songs being used in worship, since I am a staunch advocate of the RPW. 




 For example, why is Pluto a typical dog, while Goofy is an anthropomorphic dog? 

 




 The war is no longer active, for one. It is officially over. OEF is over.

Of course you might have to do hard things. That's life. There is no free lunch. Vets sometimes understand that better.

The payoff is better than any other option though. No debt, a good resume, attractive employment qualities..  




 Not to mention you will actually be headed to college with an extensive resume and real world skills. Your chances of employment after college will be way above your peers. 




 Join the Army. That is what I did. Post 9/11 GI bill benefits are phenomenal. They will literally pay for all your college.

Or you could get an ROTC scholarship, and they will pay for all of your college and you will join as an officer. 




 Get another cut. I cut my high and tight every two weeks to keep it looking fresh  




 Mostly they just do paperwork. 




 92Y, Unit Supply Specialist.

You spend most of your time outdoors. Oftentimes they get called away on special missions to help others. Sometimes they have to prepare short speeches to give in the local "soldiers only" forums, and they win special medals for properly explaining themselves.  They are always on the front lines, truly the tip of the spear. Everyone in the military calls them "the SEALs of the Army". Not everyone can make it, but if you think you are up for it, go for it! 









 In the denominatin I grew up in, SS was always the packaged lifeway spiel. I got nothing out of it. I was always way more advanced, and comparing biblical principles to pop culture always annoyed the crap out of me.

Since I have made my journey to Reformed Presbyterianism I have loved SS. We always have very beneficial discussions at my church, our teachers write their own material, I love it. Now I teach our young adult SS class, and it has been wonderful.

I think it depends what circles you run in. Super grounded/confessional churches tend to take their theology way serious, this carries over into small group. This is what I look for in SS.. My experience with more broad evangelical circles has been very different. I am not a fan of the super chill social club SS ideal. 




 I recently read [this article in the Times](http://mobile.nytimes.com/2013/06/16/books/review/prison-library-at-guantanamo.html?_r=0) (which I know is a little old) and I was struck by a few thoughts, that I thought I would extend to y'all.

1. What do you think about the censorship going on at the Gitmo library? Librarians and library supporters tend to be very anti-censorship, but I am curious if circumstances determine our vehemence? Should we strictly regulate what a society of extremist affiliates are allowed to read?

2. How important is it to have a library in a place like Gitmo?

I would love to hear any other thought's y'all have 




 I would go for Old Rasputin. 




 First, I would make a distinction between "will" and "pleasure". I believe it is the will of God to ordain all things (including the judgement of the wicked) for his glory. This does not mean he takes pleasure in their demise.

In regards to Ezekiel 33:11, I believe this is God using human language to describe divine thought. The point ot this text is the individual responsibility of every man for his sin. The point of this text is not an explanation of the redemptive plan of God, but rather a plea for repentance aimed at an ungodly nation.

 




 I am too, but it is pretty much the default explanation from every PC advocate I have ever spoken to. 




 Your disconnect is that you see baptism explicitly tied to profession of faith, and we do not. I do not believe any of those references explicitly refer to baptism being predicated by belief. Baptism is tied to the death, burial, and ressurection of Christ in the sense that it identifies the baptized one as a member of the covenant which Christ's sacrifice paid for.

The issue is, fundamentally, we do not interpret a single scirpture about baptism as referring to it being predicated by faith. 1 Cor 11:28-29 are quite obviously referring to believers. 




 I love stouts. They are truly the beer-lover's beer. I love oatmeal stouts, imperial stouts, pretty much anythubg but Guinness

 Left Handing Brewing' Milk Stout Nitro.

Stout's are my favorite styles of beer. The Nitrogen bottling makes the beer smooth and velvety. It is full bodied ans bitter in the best possible way.

Also, I am a man. And stouts are manly.  




 I was just using the example of the passover in passing.

The main reason is the aforementioned, 1 Cor. 11:28-29 make it clear that the recipient of the Supper must be able to **examine themselves** and **discern the broken body of the Lord**. 

Those who support PC often claim this verse is referring to being able to discern the supper belonging to the body (i.e. the Church) as opposed to being able to discern/understand that the supper *is* the body of Christ. 
 




 First, it was not his time. He had a plan, and it was one of gradual revelation.

Second, Christ often veils his words in the gospels. He reveals himself to those he chooses, but veils himself to others. He fully intends for the pharisees and jewish leaders to think he is lying, so he can be crucified. He *wants* to be convicted and sent to die. 

I believe it works the same way today. God reveals his gospel to those he chooses, and hardens the reprobate's heart. 




 Because infants are not capable of examining themselves so as not to partake of the Lord's Supper in an unworthy manner (1 Cor. 11). That is the simple answer.


Baptism is a continuation of circumcision. Obviously infants in the OT were circumcised. 

The Eucharist is a continuation of the Passover supper. Do you think infants partook of the paschal lamb? They were present, of course, just as our infant children are present at the Eucharist, but I doubt they partook.

We believe baptism is a sacrament which does not require anything of the recipient. The Eucharist requires the ability to cognitively examine oneself, as per 1 Cor 11. 




 In regards to my comment about the regenerate man having free will, I agree with your assessment. I was using "free will" in the same way the OP likely meant (i.e. freedom to choose right from wrong) not in the sense that our will is totally free. The idea of free will is so subjective that it is hard to get across the point.  




 You don't choose God.

As a Calvinist I affirm the doctrine of predestination. Gid chose his elect before the beginning of the world, died specifically for his elect, and he regenerates his elect. Once a man is regenerate, his will becomes unbound, but unregenerate man has a will that only acts according to his nature.

As a monergist I do not believe man has any part in salvation. 




 We don't have free will. Our wills are utterly bound and distorted by sin. We are totally corrupted from birth.
