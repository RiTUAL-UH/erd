 We all know this has nothing to do with "safety."

Oral surgery has a greater complication rate than surgical abortion. Yet somehow these restrictions weren't placed on oral surgeons (or ANY other outpatient facilities that perform such minor surgeries.) Only women's health clinics were targeted. There's no requirement for double-wide swinging doors to accommodate hospital gurneys in oral surgery facilities, for example, nor will there ever be.

This is direct, blatant, selective, and persecutive legislation by the Texas government against women's medical facilities and obstetricians performing federally legal procedures.

How many cases of cervical/uterine/breast cancer will now go undetected because of these regressive laws? How many women will die from ectopic pregnancies because they didn't have access to basic women's health care? How quickly will cases of sexually transmitted diseases expand and multiply because no testing or treatment was available? How many women will lose their only access to affordable birth control?

This entire "But... but... *it's for the womens' safety!*" charade has never been anything but a damnable lie. But you already knew that.
 




 May Texas go Blue sooner rather than later. 




  Personally.... I would want the chance to live.

You'd never have known the difference.

Call me crazy for being pro life.

And you'd probably think crazy those who view "life" as more of a non-commutable sentence of unceasing suffering ending in inevitable death than as a "gift" or a "blessing."
 




 In other news, Ben Carson won a straw poll.

 And then a state-forced three-day waiting period. 




 Still, there are many like him who actually believe such tripe. 




 Is there no end to the Duggary? 




 And we're going in first unless they are halted. 




 "LIBERTY!"^TM strikes again. 




 Ralph Nader was a multiple stroke victim who wasn't even on the ballot in all states, thus making a win *mathematically impossible.*

Nader's vanity campaign didn't draw even 4% in *ANY* state, but still he insisted on campaigning ***almost exclusively*** in swing states where polling was within the margin of error.

Are those facts relevant enough for you? 




 TIL tadpoles are frogs. 




 Multiple stroke victim Nader's hopeless, useless, self-aggrandizing "BOTH SIDES ARE TEH SAME!!1!" vanity/fantasy campaign sentenced America and the world to the hell of Bush/Cheney.

Denying the reality of it doesn't make it go away. 




 Tell that to the hundreds of thousands of Iraqi citizens who were Naderized. 




 But... but... *life begins at conception!*

/s 




 The parasite attaches to the uterine wall. Were you by any chance home-schooled? 




 If you want to be surrounded by sycophants, go to freerepublic, fox, redstate, or breitbart.

I'm sorry this forum doesn't regurgitate your worldview for you. The lack of affirmation is clearly very troublesome to your psyche. 




 Well, if it's a *legitimate* rape... 




 I guess the woman's body just has a way of shutting that whole thing down. 




 It's simple: the forced-birthers clearly don't give a damn about either mother or child after launch. Can anyone realistically argue otherwise, given their constant, consistent contempt for any/all programs to assist these post-fetal Americans?

Nope. Almost instantaneously, the women and their newborns become "welfare queens" and "welfare brats" (who don't even deserve enough in SNAP assistance to keep them alive.)

The fetus fetishists certainly don't give a shit about "honoring a Culture of Life" after launch, do they? Hiding hatred of women behind a cloak of "morality" is the exquisitely cruel SOP of the American Right.  




 concern troll is concerned 




 Based on his facial expressions, I'd wager it's up there a lot of the time already. 




 And its first birthday party at the age of three months! 




  I don't personally believe first trimester is murder, but they do

Do they really believe that? They *say* they do, but I don't think they really do. 

It's just a convenient way to justify their regressive politics, as they know they can't say publicly what they *really* feel about women. 




 At least he'll be able to perform exorcisms on his fellow inmates. 




 Right-wing extremists just can't kick their craving for Koch. 




 Yet more contempt for women from the American Right. 









 So Rand Paul has moved from plagiarism to straight-out fabrication? 




 As if the Republicans will give a shit. 




 No one cares what Rand Paul thinks about anything. 




 If it weren't for guns and fetuses, what would Republicans obsess over? 




 Walker is not pro life. He is pro birth.

Walker is "forced birth." 




  a mostly form child 

How is babby formed?
 




 How is a parasite an "unborn baby"?

Thanks for playing, Mr. Wizard. 




 What accounts for the strange, obsessive fascination that Republicans/the American Right has with lady-parts? 




 Privatize the profits, socialize the losses!

 




 Rand Pau's son William gets to assault flight attendants and get into drunken crashes. 




 it all goes back to that time as a kid when he was beaten senseless with a pool noodle 




 if accuracy is the goal, yes, absolutely. 




 orchestral manuvres in the park 




 That somersault was worthy of a Bundy Ranch "tacticool" wanna-be.

 The somersault was Reno 911-worthy. 




  I obey badgers.

BUILD US A DAM

 




 all because grover's dad stole his ice cream... 




 This is "LIBERTY!"^TM and "FREEDOM!"^TM Koch Brothers style. 




 Oh look... a one day-old, -100 account. 




 It's a food product, essentially. 




 It's almost like that time Cincinnati was bombed with turkeys. 




 Nader needs to become a "shutthefuckupandgoaway"-ist. 




 I wonder what Bob Dole thinks about all of these goings-on in Kansas? 




 *This Governorship sponsored by Kansas-based Koch Industries* 




 When you shoot with Cruz you lose! 




 Because the potential for comedy is enormous? 




 Based on their actions, the American Right believes psychopathy is a virtue. 









 Good. Someone needs to fight the GOP scammers and fraudsters. 




 How many of them are running now? 




 Why would Hillary ever debase herself so? 




 By being hateful, judgmental toolbags? 




 Fox News: Where you'll believe whatever the fuck we say! 




 Right-wing domestic terrorists.  




 It's amazing to me how the American Right defends the Duggary. 




 But ... but ... DELEGATES!

How else will they get to PaulFest? 




 When will this vulgar, vulgar woman go away? 




 *Shamu's Secret Shame* 




 ABC has, but the title over there precludes the rules of submission for this subreddit. 









 Oh so "pro-life." 




 Shitty website is shitty. Zerohedge is a joke.

It's big among the Ron Paul/Mises/Rothbard/Rockwell crowd. 




 "zerohedge" haha 




 Rand wasn't able to "defeat the American Machine" because his drunken son crashed it into a parked car. 




 The Hastert Rule: 18 year-olds might as well be Senior Citizens. 




 What is it with these right-wingers and their Duggaring of children? 




  Why do Republicans need to attack any of our universities?

Because an educated populace is the American Right's natural enemy.

 




 Republicans are authoritarians, despite all the "FREEDOM!"^TM AND "LIBERTY!"^TM bullshit.

They only hate the "damn Gub'mint" when they are not in complete control of it. 




 "Please remember to spay or neuter your Duggars." 




 Josh Duggar was 15 when he started Duggaring his 5-year-old sister.

Stop making excuses for him. 




 or protecting the family's income stream. 




 I think those are his protective Bears. 




 Holy crap 




 I wonder if a properly-certified ophthalmologist could help Rand correct his "dark vision"? 




 When will Kansas wake? 




 A warning to all Republicans on the clown car: if Josh Duggar asks you to sit on his lap so he can tell you a story, ***don't do it.*** 




 The information needs to be out there showing that the family cared more about the image of the family than the actual family members.

Even more basic: they cared about preserving their revenue stream. 




 Again, this perpetuates the American Right's oft-spread *"Social Security is going bankrupt!1!11!one!!1!"* lie.

Let's be clear: the Right's goal is to undo the 20th century and return us to the late 19th century, the age of the Robber Barons. That's not a future to which any nation should aspire. 




  maple syrup molesting racist

I don't think I've ever heard this particular allegation leveled. It sounds like a sticky situation. Any details?

 




 Do they really have a choice? Are they willing to risk exile from the family, having had no real education, out into a world from which they've been deliberately sheltered for their entire lives? How would they support themselves? Where would they go?

"She who troubleth her own house shall inherit the wind." 




  received professional counseling.

I'll bet it was some hokey pseudo-Christian "pray away your brother's play" outfit.

 




 He was helping them keep their quivers full. 




 I think people like to stand behind the Duggars because it helps prevent them from being Duggared themselves. 




 Rand tried to "defeat the Washington machine," but before he had a chance his son William got drunk and crashed it. 




 Megan Kelly's opening question: "Jim Bob, Michelle  how are you dealing with the liberal media's savage, relentless attacks on your family?" 




 It's really scary how Duggar fans are all over the Internet trying to explain away Josh's actions. 




 They study it out and train them up!

(Blanket not optional.) 




  who later claimed homosexuality leads to pedophilia.

Since by that time he certainly knew he was engaging in pedophilia with his sisters, I wonder if this "homosexuality leads to pedophilia" belief is an implied confession to Duggaring his brothers, too?

This case gets stranger each day.


 




 Multigenerational Duggary? 




  And they did talk to a cop about it.

Yeeaaaah, about that cop... he was a family friend who is now serving a 50+ year sentence for collecting/distributing child porn.

It really astounds me the lengths to which people will go to continue defending the Duggary...



 




 #***SOCIALISTS!!!1!11!*** 




 Ask the Duggars what's wrong with *them.* 




 The Duggary apologists sicken me. 




 Josh's sisters sure didn't.

 




 Ugh, quite the contrary. 




 Yet more Duggary unveiled. 




 or excitement 




 The report details that Josh went from sister to sister, stating, Apparently all of the girls were sleeping in a common room at this time.

Imagine those poor Duggar girls lying there awake while they pretended to be asleep, waiting their "turn," powerless to stop their brother Josh from molesting their sisters right in front of the others, wondering what age he'd start on the next one, knowing that they were going to be the next one forced to lift their wrinkled nightshirt so Josh could poke and probe and prod and squeeze wherever he pleased with his sweaty, trembling fingers  

 and all the time knowing that ***it must all be hidden***, first, to protect the family, second because they were allowed no contact with those outside the sect, and third because no one would ever believe them anyway, instead calling them temptresses and liars and sluts and whores who had brought utter disgrace to the family and destroyed the family's means of support with their foul lies . . .  




 The "stern lecture" family friend-cop Jim Bob and Josh talked to years after the Duggary occurred is now in prison himself, serving 50+ years for possession/distribution of child porn.

Model citizens. 




 I thought JimBob said God's law was greater than the law of man.

Well, it's different if you really, really, *really* want to bone your sisters. 




 Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar just told their daughters to pray Josh's play away. 




 FADE IN

*[Duggar Family gathers around dining table and all sit. Joe Bob begins to say grace, but his oldest son Josh Duggar interrupts him.]*

JOSH:  Dad, I'm your son. There's something you need to know. I'm a Duggar. 
And, boy I really dug her  and her, her, her, and her, too!" 

*[points to various siblings around table]*

[cut to zoom-in on Joe Bob Duggar's face, a "Home Alone"-like reaction of shock and surprise.]

*[Boingy Spring SFX, followed by Sad Trombone]*

END SCENE 




 Ooh, ooh, a "very dark plan!"

Please share the details. 




 What is, as you call it, the "transgender agenda"? 




 Ron Paul fears a lot of things. 




 And? 




 Does he also believe in the freedom to drive drunk?

Rand's son William Paul sure does. Also, there's his freedom to assault flight attendants. 




 **"I have heard of many tragic cases of walking, talking normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines."**   *** Rand Paul***  




 Don't forget "LIBERTY!"^TM
 




 And many acts of Duggary were committed! 




 Yes, I bet Josh Duggar's sides hurt from laughing.

The sister-victims Josh diddled? Not so much. 




  The European states are also much smaller geographically, much smaller in population, and much more homogenous ethnically and linguistically.

This is one of the most trusty dog-whistles of the American Right. Translated, it means "what works quite well over there won't work at all over here, because minorities."

At least be honest about the use of the statement.
 




 "I'm sorry, the card says 'Moops.'" 




 There really is no "left" in America.

The US political spectrum runs from right-wing through extremely right-wing to *insanely* right-wing. 




 What will the Republicans do when they run out of "Culture War" rage wedge issues? 




 No. That's why we all know Rand's stunts are nothing but prelude to setting up a string of MONEYBOMBS! over the next 1.5 years.

His grifter Dad Ron Paul taught him well. 




 AMA Request: Josh Duggar 




 How would the Cliven Bundy Militia have reacted if Cliven Bundy had instead received the [Eric Garner treatment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-xHqf1BVE4) ? 




 I'm pleased I was able to enhance your state of self-realization this day. Go forth, my son. 




 Nope. The Kermit Gosnell case is a perfect example of Libertarian ethics at work. 




 Bundy has also said on many, many occasions that he "doesn't recognize the Federal Government as even existing."

He's not a folk hero, and this isn't some "principled stand."  




 Ask the Duggars. 




 I hope they're just nodding along while their husbands spout Fox/AM bullshit, but listen to their own hearts and consciences when alone in the ballot box. 




 Is this the Kochs' *ALEC* unit at work again? 




 He wrote a *very* strongly-worded letter, he'll have you know. 




 An update on Sean Hannity's former best buddy.

  I have never and will never apologize for voting for Nader.

Hundreds of thousands in Iraq and Afghanistan commend you for standing by your principles.
