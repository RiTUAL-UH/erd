 No worries! Thank you, firedrops!

 How are you guys staying safe while reporting the news (do you have your own security? I presume it is unsafe to wander the streets)? And how do you filter through all the news coming in in such a chaotic environment?

Stay safe! 




 Thank you, N8theGr8!  




 I understand. Thank you for looking into it, /u/nallen! 




 Thank you, /u/nallen. 

I searched for 'DNA' and 'Iceland' before submitting - no recent submissions came up. Also, the story I submitted is talking about something entirely different than in the story you point out. 




 Here is the peer-reviewed journal entry: http://www.sciencemag.org/content/347/6226/1132.abstract 




 Totally agree! 

You and the other guys do an excellent job! If it wasn't for the consistent checking of submissions by you guys, this extraordinary subreddit would have gone down the hill. Sometimes finding the correct/corresponding peer-review entry is not easy.

Thanks! 




 Hi Dr_Peach - 

I think its related to this peer-reviewed entry http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/02/26/molbev.msv046.short?rss=1 and not the one you highlighted.

 Thank you, ecafyelims. I submitted it to r/news. I did search and find some prison stories but I guess they were more related to the political side of the story.
