 the idea of having 2 static second divisions is fucking stupid 



















 how neat would it be to have both groups in MLS? a genuine city rivalry 




 right? so damn close 









 Ronaldinho 





























 given that Picault was the one consistent   meaningful player on the Strikers this season, I'm surprised 





































































 I find that first draft is just the version with all the mistakes   tangents   ugly notes--a way to puke it all on the page. So I like writing with a pen   paper because it allows for more fluidity. A type-script it usually a second draft, where things are edited both as I type and from the 1st draft/notes 
























 thanks, for the input. [the paperback cover](https://www.createspace.com/5113670) is a bit different. I really dig the pic, which I think is by [William Azcona](https://fbcdn-sphotos-e-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xaf1/t31.0-8/s960x960/820841_553538574670517_705785478_o.jpg). I hope you consider picking up the book! 












































 So early in November I published my first epic fantasy novel, [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/Adversaries-Together-Ascendant-Realms-Book-ebook/dp/B00PB4I5X4/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8 sr=1-1 qid=1416618174). It's swords   sorcery only without the sorcery. I've been able to complete about a third of the second book in the series, which I'm hoping to have available in the early Spring.

 Part of the siege of one of the cities in [Adversaries Together](https://www.createspace.com/5113670) is based on anecdotes from the siege of Leningrad. Hoping to have the next novel in the series expand on it

 it's not poking your nose. purpose of this network is to ask   socialize. to your question--so far my book's been available for 2 wks as an ebook. not a lot of sales but through KDP I get 70% royalties which is solid. So, will it pay your rent? No. Will it make more money than not publishing? Yes 














 I'm writing my second fantasy novel now, just self-published the first [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4). Would love to hear your thought, Hannah

 Anthony Ryan's Blood Song was a big hit recently. And you could try [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4) 




 [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4)
Tumbledown, Robert Boswell
Girl in the Road, Monica Byrne
The Search, Geoff Dyer 




 Maybe looking into [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4) 














 I just finished Geoff Dyer's The Search--concise, quick read that's rather fun in that old school gumshoe kind of way 




 Maybe a fantasy adventure series, [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4) 




 I'll suggest [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4), more of a fantasy adventure story but without magic just in a strange world 




 Give [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4) a try, easy to approach, get into, set down, and come back to 




 [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4) has seven main characters, three of which are women--a rugged adventurer, a scrappy daughter of an elite, and a priestess who becomes more than what her faith can handle. All of them resist or grow beyond the damsel in distress trope 




 Why not give [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4) a try 




 I submit [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4) 




 There are a slew of new ebook series to get into early on like [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4) 




 I really enjoyed Blood Song, easy to get into and satisfying. Also, [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4) 




 [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4) doesn't have any sex or magic, but it's mostly characters talking and thinking so it's light on gore
 




 If you're interested in a quick read as an ebook that's a new series [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4) 




 so then what could such a genre be called? Speculative, maybe? 




 fair point, I'll polish that line. 









 I wrote what I consider to be a fantasy novel, [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4), but I made it a point to not have any magic. It seems that a lot of folk in the genre are resistant to this idea. Regardless of the quality of my scribbling, I'm wondering what others think. Does a story that's fantasy have to have magic? If it doesn't, is it then sci-fi? If not, what kind of genre would it be? 




 Blood Song and The Name of the Wind are easily accessible and engaging. I would also say [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4) 




 I wrote [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4) to feature three strong woman leads--one an aggressive adventurer, one a scrappy daughter of a city's leader, and another a nun-like character that sheds her naivete but refuses to compromise her beliefs. All done without having to fall in love or be damsels in distress 




 [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4) is about groups of elites in a fantasy world looking to conquer--one character is looking to take over the world's religion, another wants to become emperor, and a third wants to bring to the world to its knees by dominating it economically 




 [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4) is a fantasy adventure but it has zero magic and centers more around the plots and scheming of elites looking for more power and the common folk enduring them 




 [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4) keeps things platonic, simply people trying forge trusting relationships 




 Writing [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4) I made it a point to work towards a balance of active, meaningful men and women characters that aren't 'in love' but are just people working together 




 [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4) centers around a core of seven characters involved in intrigues of four different nations vying for power 




 I'd like to think the character Avery Roth in [Adversaries Together](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PB4I5X4) fits this 














 one of the things I always thought would be cool would be to base fantasy or scifi worlds on the what the continents looked like in deep time. this is part of a small attempt to do so
