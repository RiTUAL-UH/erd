 I've heard that 5-15 year old Mazdas rust like hell in Canada.

 I don't really think of this view that way. What I mean is the potential to help out overpopulation a bit is the reason why I think things such as driving without a seatbelt on should be legal. 









 They did a surprisingly good job.

 Most muscle cars from 1974-84. Such as the Chevy Cosworth Vega, Olds 442, and Volare based Road Runner.

 I agree, I feel safer when I don't have to rely on technology to drive. 




 Its the same car, before the fire. 









 That's what I thought, driver aids and other electronics, but otherwise the difference between 2005 and 2015 cars seems quite small when compared to say, 1955 vs 1965 or 1985 vs 1995 cars. 














 Infiniti Q50, Cadillac XTS, Mercedes C/E, Lexus LS/GS/ES/IS are all good choices. Also check out /r/whatcarshouldibuy.

 [Yup.](http://jalopnik.com/the-six-best-unreliable-cars-you-can-buy-from-carmax-1687770994) 




 A 5-7 year old C-Class might not be the most pleasant when its time for repairs, but should be less expensive than an E or S class. If this worries you, I would recommend finding one with lower miles or trying to find one from Carmax if you can, since they warranty all their used cars.

Edit: Unfortunately they don't seem to have any AWD in stock. 




 2008-10 Mercedes-Benz C300s and C350s were available in manual with AWD. Here's one, but they seem to be relatively rare in the US,

 and why most German cars in the northeast are now all wheel drive. 




 I feel like even though enthusiasts complain about some cars being FWD, most buyers could care less. For example, a non-enthusiast cross shopping a FWD Audi A8 and a RWD Mercedes S550 is probably more concerned with amenities and badge prestige than they are with which wheels propel the car. 




 This is getting old and annoying. 




 Should be cheaper to maintain than similar German cars.

 But it was likely not the texter's first time texting and driving. This was just a fender bender, but sometimes texting while driving can be just as dangerous as drunk driving. 




 These posts are kind of old, but are still good examples of what I mean. Both did something pretty dangerous, and likely not for the first time, but the difference in how in one there is a lot of flaming and in the other one the commenters take on the attitude of "Sorry you messed up, good thing your car looks nice again" seems interesting to me.

 Meant to write LR2, the other name for the Freelander. 




 It was silver. 




 The XF is pretty nice looking, but took some getting used to since it is such a radical departure from traditional Jaguar styling. I strongly agree on the Freelander, that thing looks like a poorly restyled, overpriced, Ford Escape. 









 They sell very few and most people don't see the appeal of a "luxury Kia". They should've developed a separate luxury brand. 




 A few days ago, I saw a 99-02 E55 AMG driver going 80+ mph on the highway and driving like an asshole in general. I think that the reason why he drove like this is because he thinks that since it's an AMG, it feels like a supercar to this douche, when in reality it's a 15 year old, 350 hp, mid-level luxury sedan. 




 For some reason, I think that the Hyundai Genesis and Equus sedans, and the Kia K900 look like they would be more at home in a video game like GTA, Saints Row, or Watch Dogs than the would in real life. I'm guessing it must be because of how they are an amalgamation of different familiar designs. 




 The problem isn't that it's a bad car, the problem is that by not marketing it properly, making it too expensive, and not making a manual available, they have screwed up it's potential at being a popular car. I have only ever seen one in person.

 Population control 




 Long Island, NY 




 I saw a girl around here drive this 90s Sentra for about six months with really bad rear end damage. The trunk lid was smashed in and didn't look like it could close or open, bumper was split, taillight lenses cracked, and lots of duct tape. This is in a state with yearly inspections. 


Edit: Also once saw an elderly man driving an 80s Olds Cutlass that was completely covered in rust, as if it had sat in a pond, and dragging its tail, as if there were a few bodies in the trunk, going 10 under the speed limit.


Edit: Your rolling wrecks and the speed they go sound 10x worse, sounds like you live in a third world county.

 With the way MB styling has been going, I hope it's better than the current facelifted E. 









 Tata or Tatra? 









 Last year my aunt called a W126 a "15 year old Mercedes". Also, one time when I was 11 I saw a 560SEC and thought it was a newer car (this was 07-08ish). 




 Many German cars (W210, E38, etc.) and the LS400 also. I would never mistake any of these, or the NSX or Supra, as well as the Skyline for new cars, but they don't yet appear to stand out in traffic as "old" looking. Part of it might also be because I'm a child of the late 90s-early 00s and the designs still seen normal to me. 









 I strongly agree on the Cadillacs, but I think the 3 series BMWs have aged pretty well in some cases. 




 Reminds me of this early 80s Mercury Grand Marquis I've seen driving around with a Regan-Bush sticker. 









 As the CA government is always concerned with the environment, I'm guessing that due to pressure from enthusiasts with older cars who don't regularly use them, they've decided to compromise by making them pay a fee to avoid smog testing, while also not making it any easier for people who are broke to keep their old clunkers on the road.

 We wanted a girl but are having a boy. I would consider raising him as a girl instead if you think this would have a good outcome. I figure that we will treat him as a girl and not tell him he's really a boy. Put him in dresses, grow his hair long, give him dolls to play with, etc. I  believe that when puberty comes testosterone will make "her" into a "girl" who is, bigger and stronger than most actual females, giving "her" an advantage in sports. I am also hoping that her masculine features will deter boys from wanting to date her when reaching high school age. Will this work and have you ever tried something like this? 









 The V12 S600s are also very complex and expensive to maintain, making an earlier trip to the scrapper more likely, but I don't think that most of the W140s produced are S600s. 




 My first thought was how out of place it seemed there. Perhaps it was originally a military import. 














 I have watched a lot of police pursuits on TV and the internet and when I saw a foot chase recently that was recorded by helicopter, where the suspects were out of sight of ground cops for some time, I noticed a manhole. I then wondered why no one ever hid in the sewer to evade in these videos, wouldn't that put them out of sight of the helicopter? 









 If you ever go to a poor area, you will likely see older Lincolns and other ratty luxury cars with broken air suspension. They scrape, ride high, bounce up and down going over potholes, and sometimes have one side far higher up in the air than the other. 




 They were largely purchased by elderly people, often as their very last car. This means that low-mile, well maintained examples, available at low prices are not hard to find. If you live in Florida or another warm state, it is likely that they were only driven half the year. 




 Its the supermarket storebrand F F. 




 I remember hearing about this being a big issue for Mercedes-Benz owners in the 1980's, but recently, I have been seeing a few Mercedes-Benzes and one Cadillac driving around with the grille emblems yanked out. I remember seeing a small, sudden amount of them about six months ago, but yesterday, I saw three, two MBs and the Cadillac, all late model. Do the emblems have any resale value or does somebody just think its fun to be a dick? 




 70s-80s full size American cars.

 Both are Mercedes-Benz imitations built by mid-range brands and sold for a comparatively lower price, with lower quality.

 Any one of these or all three, 

- Z06 swapped late 70s early 80s Chevy Caprice.

- 630E W123.

- LS400 with Toyota Century V12 and supercharger.

All would be kept stock looking. 




 Think about it. All those muscle cars seemed old and impractical back then, as well as earlier. Today, the E30 M3, and some other 1980s European sports cars still seem practical for daily driving and feel somewhat modern. Also, it seems like I perceived the 60s-70s as longer ago back then than I perceive the 80s as being now. 



















 I'm surprised to see the XTS here. It seems relatively popular around here. Not terribly common, but far from rare.

 How accurate have previous renderings been to what is actually built? 




 I don't see it, to me it looks as much like the current S Class as the W124 looked like a W140. 




 When the W212 first came out, I thought it was ugly and felt disappointed that the W211 out of production, but then it grew on me. 




 Just thought of this, how about a vintage VW Bus, or a Vanagon.

 I have a professor who has a fear of rodents. If this were available as a t-shirt, I would wear it to her class. 














 I once saw a highly modified 55' Chevy that had been put on a 96' Caprice chassis. 




 A few weeks ago, I came across a user who has posted various radical and nonsensical opinions, including [this one] (http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/2ywoot/dad_smuggles_baby_in_plastic_bag_out_of_hospital/cpdnfvq?context=3), and has been showered in downvotes because of how crazy what he writes is. He is apparently a [sovereign citizen] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_citizen_movement) and sounds like a real tinfoil hatter. I would love to see this guy defend himself in court, though I'm sure somebody else must be even nuttier.

 I call Subaru and Toyota's shade of orange "county orange" because it reminds me of prison jumpsuits. 




 I agree. Whenever I see a beige or gold Mercedes or BMW I always cringe. Once I saw a beige Bentley and thought "why?". On the bright side, some golds from the 60s-70s aren't so bad looking.

 They've been playing too much GTA. 




 Yeah, but it's just interesting to see the flaws in their attempted realism.  



















 I'm sure it isn't too common, though I have seen these types of cars a few times on eBay. I thought of asking because I recently watched the Jay Leno Toronado video.

Edit: and apparently I'm a prick for asking. 




 The first such car I can think of off the top of my head is Jay Leno's Olds Toronado, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuB5DULvw7Y. 




 In particular, how did you do it and what was the result. Most cars are built specifically with their layout in mind, so I would imagine that a RWD converted car that was FWD from the factory may be kind of awkward. 



















 Apple products auto select Cupertino for weather updates, so maybe they just decided to give their otherwise obscure hometown a name in case the site becomes famous. 




 This does not sway me at all. 1.2 million fatalities a year out of a global population of 7 billion isn't so bad for our species. That means 1.2 million less people around to pollute and use resources. The decrease in deaths will also be bad for those of us who need organ transplants, since the supply will be decreased. Why don't we ban contact sports, motorcycles, and bicycles too. I personally believe that at best self driving cars will be cars with driver aids and at worst, a novelty item like flying cars, at least in our lifetimes. 




 What I mean by this is that it is common for billionaires such as the Koch brothers or Sheldon Adelson to influence politics by giving campaign contributions, gifts, etc. to politicians (arguably legalized bribery). Could such a person with tens of billions of dollars buy a large amount of stock in a highly regulated industry, such as alcohol, tobacco, or firearms and then pay politicians in order to make regulations more lax and decrease taxes, therefore making higher sales of these products easier. After doing this would they likely sell the stocks with a value that has gone up significantly and make a profit doing so?

But then I realized that it would probably become a haven for nutjobs who want to glorify robberies, dangerous driving, mass murder, and other violent crimes which would probably give GTA fans a bad name. 














 III era GTA logic. 









 I believe that the reason why GTA: O is not officially called "GTA V Online" is because when newer games come out like GTA 6, 7, etc. GTA Online will still be the same GTA Online, but with new additions. There will be a major update with each new single player title, which will add and replace some things in Online. This means that there will be new missions, characters, maps, cars, weapons, improved graphics etc., added on as a significant update when each new game is released. In the future, we may be able to drive across state borders or take flights to other regions in GTA: O. Is this a possibility or am I just dreaming?
