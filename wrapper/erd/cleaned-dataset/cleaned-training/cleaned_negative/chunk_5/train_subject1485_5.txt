 And a Labour MP wants special cycle lanes for women:
http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2710781/Women-need-special-cycle-lanes-pootle-away-scary-lycra-clad-men-says-ex-Labour-minister.html 




 No one photoshopped her hugely racist comments about Finnish nurses though, or about Caribbean mothers . The fact is she has a proven track record of racism going back years and the reason the racist posters are so believable is becasue she's the most racist person in Parliament. 




 Shame it gets spent mutilating African people's genitals for no good reason. 









 The problem with this strategy is that it can be interpreted as sexual, and there's an increasing amount of opposition in society to heterosexual men being open about sexual matters and a general tendency to demonise men and sex.

There is already a fairly strong pro foreskin movement within the gay community and that seems to work ok, and it would also work for women to express their desire and attraction for men with a natural penis. However, different rules apply to most men it can be slightly risky to celebrate the foreskin too much. Obviously it's nothing like the same as circumfetishists who gets their kicks out of mutilating kids, but clearly the best strategy is to attack such child abusers.

To be honest there's nothing to celebrate about having a foreksin becasue that's just normal isn't it and how things are meant to be? We don't celebrate having legs or arms do we? 





























 An alternative feminist school of thought is that all sex is rape, so those who prefer that theory at least don't regard celibate men as rapists. 




 I see the whoel thing has been debunked over at r/unitedkingdom. The lowest suicide rate of all was under Heath for example. 




  But given that national GDP changes were factored into the Australian study

Yes but is that simply GDP or GDP per capita? Under the Tories GDP has risen but only becasue they keep immigration at or near to Labour's previously huge levels, the average person is no better off. Furthermore, men are often left behind and on the scrap heap even during a recovery, so even though most people might be getting richer they could still be suffering in silence. For example labour decimated manufacturing in this country through mis-rule and closed down male industries such as mining. Thatcher continued with some of the closures and didn't' exactly help matters, but ultimately it was Labour who did a lot of the damage.

Ultimately, suicide is now mostly a male issue and all the Tories are pretty bad, it's still the case that the most anti-male agenda comes from Labour (and similar parties elsewhere in the world). We could cut suicide massively if we dealt with the awful family courts, actaully helped the 40% of domestic violence victims who are men, dealt with the sexist justice and prison system, introduced shared parenting and actually took men's health seriously. 




 Any chance of archive links to return of kings articles in future please? 




 I didn't read it in full, though one issue is that many suicides are a result of years of depression and long term factors such a failed relationships, unemployment. So for examples, someone would have lost their job and their house etc under the crash of the economy under Labour, though the associated depression wouldn't have resulted in their actual suicide until the coaltion were in power.

Also, I know for a fact that certain departments at the University of Bristol have some absolutely vile people with the most extreme views on issues and as a result I wouldn't trust half the research associated with that particular University (and I'd go so far as to assuming the exact opposite was true in many cases). 




 You might want to cross post something to r/unitedkingdom as there was a huge amount of interest in this story there. 









 That headline was automatically generated, nothing to do with me at all. 



















 I was the very first person to email them about this (I started the thread on the topic too) and I received exactly the same type of aggressive response.  In other words, they're not flipping out after being contacted numerous times, this has been their exact attitude right from the very start. 




  several threatening emails and tweets

I've seen both tweets in question and also sent an email myself. The only "threatening" aspect is that they "threaten" to report the company if it doesn't comply with the law. They really are pathetic and childish, why not just reply politely/professioanlly and at least promise to investigate? And I've seen some pretty lame claims of a "cyber attack" before but this has top top the lot. Since when does a few people either lemaling, tweeting or posting a review constitute such a thing?  





























 Hi Jeremy, any chance of the BBC covering this popular story on hate speech by a Lib Dem executive committee member?:

https://hequal.wordpress.com/2015/04/01/kill-all-men-fk-men-die-cis-scum-says-lib-dem-executive-committe-member/
https://hequal.wordpress.com/2015/03/26/genocidal-hate-speech-by-lib-dems-at-the-national-union-of-students-womens-conference/

It has received a huge amount of attention here on Reddit with around 1,000 comments in total, yet no one from the MSM has picked up the story yet despite it clearly been worthy of coverage. 




 They did t least get the female part right though. Their MP is female as were their last 2 leaders and their voters also tend to be female. Explains their sexist prison policy I suppose? 




 Here's the original video, it currently has a 1.7% approval rating (8 thumbs up and 471 thumbs down):

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THNUYnXQahc

The video was funded by the Tata corporation 














 Site says I have to be a subscriber to read the article so here's an alternative:

 Insurance discrimination only became illegal a couple of years ago. Therefore all those focusing on giving discounts to women were in the clear until relatively recently. 




 Probably ok for individuals to seek a discount (perhaps they're all very light users for example?). Have you attempted to obtain a similar discount for yourself? 




 Their email address is: reception@peakfitnessgym.co.uk 




 No. 




 Comments in the thread also highlighted this case of blatant sexism too:

http://www.ballroomscotland.com/membership-male.html 









 The panel shows are feminist controlled now what with the mandatory female quota regardless of merit. 




 Unsurprisingly, the ignorant interviewer also has a second job working for the BBC. Is it any wonder they're so biased when this is the type of person they keep recruiting? 




 I think it's a fair statement to make as these things tend to be based on previous results. It probably won't be an appropriate description in a month's time though. 




 No, though I can see why you might ask and others have assumed the same thing. The tweets are still in place so you can check for yourself. 




 No sign of Jo Swinson condemning this, despite her remit being equalities 









 It's not one of my victories (though it is exactly the sort of thing I like to do).

 














 It's actually really improving of late. The new Breitbart London team in particular seems to be especially good. 


































 So why has this been deleted? Reason given says "no local crime stories" yet that "rule" **doesn't even exist on the rules page**. This was almost the top story on r/worldnews at the time it was deleted and it's quite clearly a hugely significant event in terms of showing real progress in astarting to protect the millions of male rape victims worldwide. 



















 Well one moment you had Sturgeon as Jim Bowen and then later Cameron had the same voice. If Sturgeon is going to be be Bowen then other people can't be him too. 




 Welsh one was perfect too (no idea what her name is). Didn't much like how you switched voices round though. 




 Listening to the insanity of Bennett is half the fun though, and she'd obviously be out first which is some ways would make it boring.

Really enjoyed the intro to Sturgeon btw. 




 Update - she's stepped down. Strange really, thought the Greens were big fans of female criminals such as her.

http://www.nottinghampost.com/Election-2015-Disgraced-landlord-Victoria/story-26277800-detail/story.html

The guy's death wasn't through violent means so, becasue she's a woman, the Greens wouldn't have even given her a suspended sentence! 









 Actually the video deletion message clearly gives "hate speech" as the reason for the removal. you can see proof of that here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?annotation_id=annotation_3887820991 feature=iv src_vid=_ChQom6yCuc v=rQ8ijScrUS8

Either someone at Youtube HQ  clicked the wrong button or this is 100% political censorship.


 









 Seems there was a campaign against the video, full story about the censorship here:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvqVxDO8z0Q

Note that they've also disabled a lot of features of the video owner's channel. 





























 Lib Dem is a legitimate term in the UK for political party the Liberal Democrats. It is completely neutral, uncontroversial and the party happily uses it themselves, even on their website addresses!

Also the correct name is "HEqual". 









 1. Do you support shared parenting? I note you didn't sign EDM 210 here: http://www.parliament.uk/edm/2013-14/210

2. What is you view of genital mutilation of male children? Do you think it is an appropriate use of scarce NHS funds to fund such abuses? 




 **Please name them!** 




 If it's hard to choose between two parties then try to examine the two candidates that are standing in your area and investigate which one has the most egalitarian values.

It's pretty easy to spot man hating feminists and their friends if you look into people's backgrounds. And if you've got a particularly nasty feminists in with a chance of winning then a vote for anyone standing against them counts as progress. 









 This might be of interest: http://empowering.hearst.co.uk/be-involved/jo-swinson-web-chat/ 









 why not try messaging twitter accounts of the exec committees she sits on and also Lib Dem equality ministers?

Some examples:
@LGBTLD
@HSLibDems
@julianhuppert (Lib Dem equalities spokesperson)
@joswinson (Lib Dem and minister for equalities)


 




 Lib Dem party code of conduct for reference: http://www.markpack.org.uk/71459/code-of-conduct-for-liberal-democrat-party-members/

 Well the Liberal democrats didn't tend to be into this sort of thing quite as much as the Labour Party or Greens, so it is a little surprising. 




 Probably the least significant of the four positions. The Yorkshire branch position and the LGBT one seem to be the most significant. 




 The "all" was in reference to killing men, not fucking them. 




 This isn't an April fools prank BTW. The tweets are all genuine. 




 Wonder if she's added herself to the block list? There are clearly numerous violations there which would merit a level 1 block. 




 This is real btw. Not an April fools article unfortunately. 




 She actually sits on three lib den exec committees and a further policy committee for liberal youth. Taken together that makes her pretty significant. 



















 This guy isn't one of us. That said, there's absolutely no reason why youtube should censor that video. 














 Please remember to donate to the J4M B election campaign. The deadline for donations to fund the leaflets is 6th April:


https://j4mb.wordpress.com/2015/03/22/11904/

It's excellent value for money becasue under UK electoral law the Royal Mail is obliged to deliver every single leaflet for free! 




 In the long run it forces at least one of the two to take men's human rights seriously. 




 Your misunderstand the strategy. You target seats where the election is on a knife-edge and where you can ruin things for whoever is currently in power there.

It sends a strong message that people can either support equality for men or they can face extra opponents who will take votes away from them and possibly cost them their seat. 




 This J4M B fund-raiser represents great value for money activism so please get involved if you can.

The way UK electoral system works is that each party gets one leaflet delivered free of charge by the Royal Mail wherever they are standing. Therefore donors only need fund the printing cost and then the leaflet gets delivered **free of charge.**

Given that the cost of postage on the UK equates to about 53 pence (80 cents), **you're basically getting $9 worth of services for every dollar you give!**

I'd challenge anyone to find a better value way of donating to men's human rights causes right now.

Donation are accepted from abroad as long as they are less than 5,000

Here's an article with further info:

I realise that quite a few fund-rasiers by various organisations have been listed recently, but I'd challenge anyone to find a better value way of donating to men's human rights causes right now. 




 Yes, J4M B has had one hell of an impact. Might not work so well in a two party country such as the USA, but on the other hand it would be perfect in a system that used proportional representaiton. 




  remake Harry Potter but as a girl!

Seems rather narrow minded of you, why can't he be a Japanese fire engine?

 




 Castle seemed mostly very good from what I've read about her though I wasn't around at the time to know for sure so maybe there's a negative side I've not read about

Mo Mowlam seemed better than most, and Dunwoody was also light years ahead of anything Labour have right now. 




 Yes, with about 10 minutes leadership between the two of them. And one is Harman and so if a woman as vile and hated as her is the best Labour have got then that says it all.

I'm not saying Labour has to install a female leader or has even had that many suitable candidates, just that it would be preferable and make much more sense to see a female Labour leader sometime rather than a female James Bond (though preferably one of those who got into power due to merit rather than via a sexist  all women shorlist). 




 Still waiting to see a female Labour leader, or even a competent female Labour politician be given a major role in the party. All the best labour women I can think of are no longer with us and instead the two who were promoted to the most important roles in recent years have been Harriet Harman and Jacqui Smith! 




 Can't find any evidence of a campaign on Twitter. Perhaps it was internal pressure by the various extremist feminists already employed by IBTimes? 




 I can only guess that thee was a feminist campaign against the column. His articles were brilliant and very popular, particularly the most recent one. 









 Did that over a year ago. Contacted the entire board, CEO etc. they changed the classifications for about 4% of the sites we highlighted and explicitly confirmed that tgey stood by the hate classification for each and every single one of the others. 




 Actually his would be pretty damn good if it included gender.  It gives excelletnt results if we include this or assume gender to be a culture. 

1. No. I cannot mostly be with other males at college/university as higher education classes are now female dominated across the western world.

2. No. Young women earn more than young men and many adverts for renting accommodation explicitly ban males, thus making it hard to access housing.

3. No. As a male, I'm far more likely to face violence than females, someone of this is likely to be by those living in my street.

4. Yes, though there are attempts by some to reduce the protein I need to consume to remain healthy.

5. No. men are demonised in the media, regularly stereotyped either as idiots, incapable parents, or as violent and abusive.

6. No. All the world's problems tend to be blamed on men, usually white men.

7. Strange question.

8. Yes, but the gaming industry is already under attack and music seems to be the next target so probably not safe for much longer.

9. This doesn't' happen to any group that I'm aware of, though in some places men are often punished becasue of their gender when buying car insurance

10. I don't have any "borthers", but whatever they are I'm sure that as a male  I'm burdened with protecting them and putting myself in harms way to do so.

11. If I use curse words it will probably be considered abusive or threatening behaviour becasue of my gender.

12. The justice system is known to discriminate against all males on a mass scale and to a huge extent. Any discrimination against ethnic minorities by the justice system is completely dwarfed by the scale of discrimination on the ground of gender. Were I a female doing so I'd simply be considered "empowered".

13. Happens to both men and women, though actually probably more so women.

14. Happens all the time. "Teach men not to rape" even a state sponsored "men can stop rape" campaign. Why am I supposed to stop men and women raping each other simply becasue of my gender?

15. Depends. Certainty not in many schools, nor in a lot of taxpayer funded institutions.

16. One domestic violence shelter for men in the whole of Canada despite half of victim being men, and will probably be arrested instead of the perpetrator if I call the police as a victim of domestic violence. Widespread discrimination in medical research against males (e.g. cancer). And if I'm on a sinking ship I'll be the last to be rescued! 



















 These scams have been popped up all over the place, I know of at least one example in the UK. 









 An anonymous coward. 









 Good job using an archive link. Wonder what his opinion is on having fathers in prisons?

Very encouraging to see that all the top rated comments call the author out on his blatant sexism and stupidity. 



















 I meant the motive behind them is 100% political, obviously they have to have more than a few genuinely offensive users on there in order to appear legitimate.

It's a men's rights issue becasue we're the ones constantly beign censored and defamed. We're the targets of these blocking campaigns, ahead of almost anyone else. Read up the the Symantec Rulespace scandal for a much more serious example of this (disclaimer - I've written more about that case than any other author so the chances are that you'll be reading my work or something based upon it). 




  The person who blocked wasn't going to listen to what the person they blocked had to say anyway, for whatever reason.

Well I agree your point apples to a lot of feminists and a lot of users of the block bots, but some people will be duped into using these block lists thinking they are genuine tools to block offensive users when they're actually 100% political.

Hearing well-argued and logical dissenting views really is a useful thing and of course there's the Twitter block function for dealing with very isolated incidents of harassment and blatant trolls. 




 True, though surely any sane person would want to use a bot that operates as described, and actually blocks sexism and hate, and these bots just don't do that.

They certainly claim be about helping people avoid some of the nastier accounts on Twitter, yet in reality many of those on the list are simply there becasue they dared to disagree or even question a particular aspect of extremist feminism.

The bots aren't about making the twitter experience any more pleasant or safer for Twitter users, they're simply political tools used to silence dissent and simply make Twitter into an echo chamber for those using them. 














 message me your twitter username or post it on here if that's allowed and we'll make that at least 31 









 I expect a fair few posters to r/mensrights are blocked by one of these bots. You can check here:  http://blockcheck.leagueforgamers.com/

Perhaps people can post below and state what block level they're subject to? The level 1 block is the most severe. 




 Congratulations, a pretty good endorsement on of your tweets. 




 Seems to be the other bot that is the really stupid one though. 














 yes but would the same newspaper have allowed such a piece directed at females or certain  ethnic minorities? 




 Very useful tool. The level 1 rank is the highest, meaning the feminists hate you more than those with a level 2 or 3 rank. 





























 At the very least, if they really must publish hate speech then they need to name the author.

Pretty cowardly of them not to give their name, and it's also despicable for the newspaper to grant anonymity to a writer for no other reason that the fact that their comments are hateful and possibly illegal. At the very least they would surely end up being fired by their employer or kicked out of whatever university they attend. 









 A quick question about blockbot, is there a list somewhere of great accounts that have level 1 blocks? If so, is there any sort of campaign for everyone to all follow these accounts therefore causing the whole blockbot thing to backfire?

I can't be the first person to think of such an idea, and apologies if it seems like a dumb question. 




 Found this to be an interesting article. i discovered that the HEqual_UK account is subject to a level 1 block.

I wonder if we could all counter this by actually finding people subject to blocks and all following them thus making the entire scheme backfire? I'm a little late to the party with regard to the block-bot story so perhaps there's already something like this in place that I'm unaware of? 









 It's obvious that the Clinton article is a complete joke. For one thing, even the page title is wrong - there are no other famous Hilary Clintons to confuse readers so Wikipedia rules make it quite clear the article should be titled "Hilary Clinton" and the name "Rodham" should be omitted.

No doubt it's the Wikipedia feminists who won't allow the correct name to be used and it looks like there have been multiple attempts by neutral editors to actually title the article correctly.

 100% true but the Liberal Democrats are far more moderate than the NUS and actually have had soe good policies over the years. Hate speech is to be expected at the NUS, but not by senior Liberal Democrat figures (it does happen, but they eventually tend to get in trouble for it if you complain) 




 Also noteworthy that she sits on 3 executive committees of a political party currently in power in the UK. 




 it will be interesting to see how the lib deme handle this. Surely will put already angry supports off them and could be the last straw for quite a few. 









 Not a good week for gender equality within the Lib Dems. 









 Imagine the media outrage had they been in UKIP instead - one for you guys to add to the list I guess. 









 This is as much about the Lib Dems as it is about feminism (if not more so).

There were clearly countless man hating feminists in attendance at NUS Women 2015 (probably more than almost anywhere else in the country). These misandrist feminists will always exist and I guess they're entitled to get together and do whatever they want. However, if people want to get involved with such extremism and actually express such vile views about half the population then there should be no place for them in the Lib Dems and they certainly should have roles on no less than 3 Lib Dem exec committees.

Ultimately, if Lib Dem exec members go out of their way to spread hatred against half the electorate than how do they ever expect to win any seats? They might pick up the self-loathing male vote, though tbh Labour and the Greens already pretty much have that tiny section of the electorate to themselves already. 




 And meanwhile the Lib Dems have someone on no less than 3 of their executive committees who thinks we "need to remove men from society":

https://hequal.wordpress.com/2015/03/26/genocidal-hate-speech-by-lib-dems-at-the-national-union-of-students-womens-conference/ 









 The author wouldn't even put there name to that piece of hate speech. It's net resting that the newspaper allows sexist and racist rants to be submitted anonymously. 









 I'm not saying these articles are the best material for this subreddit, but it is possible to see their relevance. perhaps we need a false rape subreddit to archive all this material instead? 




 Take your shitty links somewhere else. We don't want that crap here. 




 Firstly, the sentence is too short, especially as she'll almost certainly be released half way through it. Secondly, these articles will continue to be relevant for as long as feminist claim that these cases don't really happen. 














 I've actually read her other Tweets. Some of her ideas are pretty decent (e.g. on prostitution), others tweet tend to be a bit crazy or simply sexist.

Anyway, still waiting to see something objectionable about the site. Others have already replied to the tweet noting that it looks like she's promoting genocide and she hasn't denied that's what she wants. 




 Shame you don't' have the power to censor it like you did in the r/libdem subreddit isn't it?

People aren't going to vote Lib Dem with bigots like that in exec positions in the party, so covering for them is only going to casue harm in the long run. 




 Well how else does she propose on meeting this "need" to remove men from society other than using genocide. I can't really think of any other possible methods. Perhaps aborting male foetuses is nan alternative, though that's probably genocide too really.

And I'm not spreading any harassment campaign - she's the one promoting removing men form society and putting men in the bin. Her actions are clearly newsworthy and if she didn't' want to be in the headlines then she should keep spreading hatred on Twitter while occupying multiple executive positions in a major political party. 




 Hateful bigots always pretend it was all a big joke when their conduct is exposed, it's a standard defence. Furthermore, I've already uncovered a further misandrist Tweet posted on the same day by the same individual. She isn't fit to be on any Lib Dem committee, and most certainly not ones aimed at opposing discrimination.

And without wanting to defend any abuse received, if you punch someone in the face then you can expect to get punched back. Hatred simply breeds more hatred. 




 Find one single hateful, sexist or unsavoury sentence on the site. It's pro-gender equality.

If you can't find such a sentence then you need to show you're genuinely Liberal and restore this post. Lib Dems here are clearly concerned about someone on exec committees behaving in such a hateful way, and we were having a good and open discussion on the issue until you censored it. 




 Well I'm fine with putting things into context, it actually makes her look even worse. Here's another Tweet she posted on the same day:

"I keep putting men in the bin and they keep crawling out." #nuswomen15

https://twitter.com/sarahlicity/status/580390741798699008

Anyway, this is really spreading rapidly on Twitter now no matter how much the mods here try to bury the story. 




 They want equality for fathers, and although that puts them ahead of all the other main parties I'm not aware of any other good pro-equality policies they have yet.

They certainly seem to be very pro-equality, but it would be nice if they were more vocal about it. 














 Is there a code of conduct she will have breached? As a member perhaps you'd be in a strong position to make a complaint? 









 She's on the lib dem LGBT executive committee, hardly just a standard member. Also I note you just posted some lib dem surveys, do you have a connection to the party your not telling us about? 




 Here's another of her tweets from the conference: @sarahlicity: "I keep putting men in the bin and they keep crawling out." #nuswomen15 




 That sentence is nothing like what she said. Your replies are getting worse. 




 Others on Twitter view it as hate speech too and came to that. Conckudion independent of me. I don't see any of your explanations above remotely compelling  other than the standard excuse that it was all a big "joke". We're extremely blind go hate speech when it's directed at men and it's natural for this to happen in your case too. To overcome this bias try substituting the term "men" for a different group and then see how it reads. For example "we need to remove Jews from society" 




 How else would you satisfy this "need" to "remove men from society" then? Maybe she means to put them all in a prison camp or is it a more gradual thing where we just terminate all pregnancies when the foetus is identified as male? 




 Yet more sexism against men by female Lib Dems. Hardly going to do very well in May if they keep on showing such contempt for 49% of the electorate. 




 Submitted this earlier with a crap title, apologies for that. 














 For those without the time to read the article, unsurprisingly she said this while at the now notorious  NUSWmen201 event. 









 Seems more like a sticking plaster to me. Why can't we just actually tackle all the discrimination against men instead, or at least all the discrimination against them practiced by the state. 




 In all fairness, I'd guess that many of the most talented males who want to go into teaching are so intelligent/sensible and well informed that they realise it would be a bad move. Therefore the quality of male candidates is probably slightly lower than it should be, owing to the obvious misandry that exists in the profession stopping people from even applying or training. 




 The violence and fire alarm pulling in Toronto involved large numbers of people, many feminists were involved and they even recruited trade union officials to support what they did. The criminal acts and obscene harassment happened repeatedly at least 4 separate men's issues evens over the space of more than a year. You can watch video of every single incident on Youtube

For the details on feminists supporting female paedophiles read about what happened too Michelle Elliot, who pioneered research into this area (she founded Kidscape too). There's a video interview of Michelle on youtube which is essential viewing, though the main channel has been taken down so I'd need to find you a mirror. edit- i found it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzC6OfPj82I

Your point about men getting custody when they "ask" for it is meaningless. Most know they have zero chance and thus are advised not to even bother trying in court and wasting huge sums of moeny. Rich men get custody and those where the mother is clearly unfit - that's about it.

Here's a source for a feminist organisation doubting that fasle rape allegations even exist:
http://therightsofman.typepad.co.uk/the_rights_of_man/2010/02/does-the-moon-really-exist.html

Your final point sis wrong in the US, particularly colleges, who have now officially switched to a preponderance of evidence weighting for rape allegations thanks to feminists:
http://www.stanforddaily.com/2012/05/21/op-ed-against-the-preponderance-of-evidence-standard/ 




 Just try to say open a men's centre at a Univeristy (whre men are a significant minority) and feminists will oppose it  ruthlessly.

Try to organise a talk on male suicide by Warren Farrell and feminists will blockade the event, use violence and scream abuse at attendees and pull fire alarms risking everyone's safety.

Try to organise a conference on female paedophiles (who typically abuse boys) and feminists will protest it.

Try to point out that 40% of dv victims are men and they need shelters, feminists will lie and agree and oppose funding for such facilities.

Feminist organisations openly campaign against shared parenting, and campaign for women to have custody of children. They deny that false rape accusations even exist (thus meaning all the male victims of false rape allegations who comitt suicide therefore don't really exist). They hijacked the domestic violence shelters in this country for political purposes and forced the pro-equality founder out of her own organisation becasue she dared to not that a lot of the women in the shelters were also pretty violent and abusive themselves and therefore dv wasn't a gender issue.

Feminists are even attakcing men in the justice system, removing even the most fundamental of rights such as the concept of innocece before proven guilty.

I'm not saying their aren't other obstacles to equality for males, and the more conservative/macho attitude of some doesn't' help. However, it's feminists that are now by far the strongest, most vocal, most committed and most successful opponents of the human rights of men. 




  Is that a recent thing? I remember when my brother was at primary school they only had one or two male teachers in the entire school and they were adored by the parents

Being adored by parenting doesn't really help you keep your job much. The hostility to male teachers comes from other teachers, management and generally hostility to men overall as a group. 




  takes some real issues that men (and everyone) should be talking about and turns them into a club to beat women and feminists with
