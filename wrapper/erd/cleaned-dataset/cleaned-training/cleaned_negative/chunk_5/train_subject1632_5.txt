 It's not anything like that.  It's a courtesy to you, so that you have ample time to refill at your convenience before you run out of meds. :/ 




 If I were in this situation, I'd either mail some to myself or empty all but the amount I need into another container for storage, and bring enough for the vacation in the original branded bag.  Either one seems like a safe bet to me, given the relatively low stakes. 




 The only problem is with the MSM being mistaken for some other illegal substance (cocaine, anthrax, etc).

You should not bring more than you need, and should bring it in its original labeled container with the supplement label etc.  You shouldn't declare it or anything, but you also shouldn't try to hide it.  Just pack it in the bottom of your bag.

You're probably better off putting it in your checked baggage if you have any, as the standards for screening checked baggage are less strict than for carry on luggage (baggage that you have no access to doesn't pose the same security risk).  There is a chance they will find it and throw it away, leaving you to buy new MSM at your destination. 




 Yeah - this is terrible advice.  It basically guarantees that if discovered, the MSM will be assumed to be an illegal drug and OP a smuggler. 




  I think I'm more on the opposite end of semantics here, in that I think the distinction is meaningless because what we think of as "material" includes things like gravity and consciousness; there is no "immaterial" point of reference. We can safely assume that these properties are part of the material realm because we can't go about seeing if those things exist in the absence of any physical matter whatsoever (and given what we understand about space and such, seems like in the closest thing to that kind of setting, those things don't show up). As in, the whole idea of "immaterial" doesn't make sense because it lacks reference to anything we could experience. Our being there to experience it would necessarily invalidate what it is. Hopefully that makes sense. It's late and that was a long one.

I'm having a hard time seeing how your view here differs from the apparent neutral monism you say it contrasts with.  How do you define "material" and "physical"?  From your treatment, it almost seems like you've assumed our observations of reality are of something material as a starting point. 




 Food for thought... 




 What you smoking marijuana for?  You gay? 




 Sacramento is a huge liberal city.  The rest of the central valley is a rural conservative farmtown wasteland. 




 Well, perhaps it could happen there; I could also imagine it.  But the vast majority of Americans, including me, don't live in small towns where everyone knows each other... 




 Haha - OP isn't even addicted to opiates.  Kratom's only indication in assuaging the effects of withdrawal is as a replacement for another opiate - sort of like methadone treatment.  Replace one addiction with another.

But OP doesn't even have an opiate addiction to start with. :P 




 Ah; I understand now.  I had thought that your mention of Lexapro was only tangentially related to your withdrawal, having assumed that you were addicted to an opiate or stimulant.

It seems unlikely that your main complaints were caused by the reduction in your dose of Lexapro; the % change in dose is small, and you're still solidly within the normal therapeutic dose range.  If your symptoms were caused by the drop in dose, it is unlikely that you'll continue to experience them for long.  SSRI withdrawal generally resolves within a week-ish, and intense symptoms are usually even more brief.

Have you considered the possibility that your symptoms are being caused by something else?  Perhaps you could investigate other potential causes that you could eliminate (e.g. hormonal birth control, stress, diet / lack of nutrition, lack of exercise, lack of social contact, some bodily illness or infection).

There are many ways that a person could come to feel anxious, nauseous, and alone - most of which have little to do with small changes in the dose of an SSRI. 




 :/

I didn't say "let's debate it right here and now"; I merely stated that it is open to debate.  You seem to agree, considering your attempt to debate the topic with me. :P 




 OP, what drug are you withdrawing from?  What was your habit like, and how long did you have it?

I know your life must be very painful right now, and apparently has been for awhile...but this *will* pass, and you *can* endure it and come out the other side.  Try to keep a larger perspective, consider how short this time is relative to what time lies ahead for you. 




 The lecture itself, which ended before the linked section from the OP, is much more dense with content than is the Q/A.  At least watch the second half of it (starting ~20 minutes in) so you will understand what Chomsky is on about when he says there is no body and that physicality is so ill-defined that no coherent mind-body problem can be posed.  It isn't so naive as it might look if you just stumbled into the Q/A without an understanding of the topic at hand. 




 Chomsky is building on a foundation that he laid out earlier in the talk.  You would probably understand where he is coming from when he invokes the non-existence of body and the lack of coherent meaning in the term physical in the Q/A if you watched at least the latter half of the talk itself; he offered considerable context from analytic philosophy and science.  Whatever flaws exist in the ideas Chomsky presented in the lecture and Q/A, it is unlikely that any of them arose from an ignorance of the literature.

The talk begins ~1 minute into the video, and concludes ~40 minutes in with the start of the question / answer period. 




 Your initial comment *was* reasonably inflammatory.  You seem to think you're on the moral high ground in this thread, but you are antagonizing your partner in debate.  Neither of you is writing in a manner consistent with the etiquette of this sub. 




 That's a ridiculous way to frame the systemic problem of police brutality in the United States.  If it's all about individuals and their failings, why is the justice system organized so as to encourage this kind of behavior and protect those who do it? 




 Makes sense; thanks for sharing.  Where I come from, if you created such a scene like that running from police, when they finally did catch you (and they certainly would), you'd likely be surrounded by highly aroused shouting cops with firearms drawn.  You'd be fortunate to survive the arrest without injury, and to afford bail so as not to wait several weeks in jail for a court date. 




 Where did this all take place, your story from your teenage years?  In America, where I am from, I seriously doubt running from the police like that could lead to anything but arrest and likely injury. 




  And what if the state is absolutely terrible in providing education and health care? What if the state does other things with the funds it takes in, things that are not only not beneficial to society but destructive? 

This is what keeps libertarianism relevant, in my view.  Parapolikala's state enforced taxation to provide everyone with the basic necessities of modern life as a fair compromise would be very appealing **if it worked.**  Whether it has been shown to work is, I think, quite open to debate. 




 LSD and peas and carrots go together like music? :O 




 Fair enough, yeah.  There wasn't much to the post and it did seem a bit moralistic. 




 I understand your point, but disagree that this would necessarily solve the problem of excess salt.  If that were true, then surplus would never be a problem. 




 There's a lot there; some of it is plainly absurd, such as the claim that the cardiac cycle has been refuted as the driving force of the circulatory system.  Other parts of the article seem quite reasonable, such as the brief review of the lack of scientific consensus on the role of mattress / bedding selection in the treatment of lower back pain (nothing to debunk there - results are conflicting and few).

Much of the article consists of non-controversial statements of fact, such as the fact that hard surface sleeping has long been common in Japan.  Nothing to debunk there - it's true! 




 /r/hailcorporate ? 




 Misleading title. Not the UN, but one individual who used to work in the UN. 




 Similarly to the Mona Lisa example, the title To Kill a Mockingbird invokes a far more specific image, and one that is far less relevant to contemporary art than is the image of the dark side of the moon.  The fact that "the dark side of the moon" is the title of an album does not mean that the only use for the phrase is to reference prior work. 




 Wait for her to come home one night and just start a conversation about anything, then if you notice her pupils are dilated you could call her on it. 

This sounds like a great way to alienate your sister, OP. :/ 




 I don't see how there is any conflict no matter what I admit or don't.  Who cares if two artistic works invoke the same image? 




 Octarine core gives 450 HP and +4 HP regen, +400 mana and +100% mana regen.  It has a decent build up if you start with the soul booster, aiding in survival and mana pool in the early midgame if timed correctly.

But it is questionable, as you said, to build such an expensive item that gives no stats for your illusions. 




 Are you REALLY CLAIMING that the artist who titled this song didnt assume that 99.9999% of people would think of pink floyd when they heard the title.

Not in particular, no.  I'm saying that there are plenty of reasons to reference the dark side of the moon in art that have nothing to do with an album by Pink Floyd.

A person can have more than one reason for doing something, you know.  I don't see a problem with it.

Dark Side of the Moon was a great album that invoked the image of the dark side of the moon; this was a nice song that invoked the image of the dark side of the moon.  Where is the conflict?   




 As a vegetarian, I honestly have no attraction to eating meat - with the possible exception of fish.  I would eat lab-grown tofu, and possibly lab-grown fish, supposing that a reasonable expectation of safety could be established. 




 That may be..but don't you think the stance of U.S. politicians on this topic is heavily influenced by the religious views of the country's massive Christian population? 




 Pshh, you just came here to be cranky. :P 




 I disagree.  Your only possible reason for calling your painting the Mona Lisa is to reference the existing painting called Mona Lisa.  There are plenty of reasons to reference the dark side of the moon in art that have nothing to do with an album by Pink Floyd.

This is the artist's page on the site written in the lower left of the image.  It's apparently sold there in high quality prints. 




 Yeah, Tahoe is nice. 




 There are different kinds of probiotic supplement.  Follow the directions on your supplement.  Most are intended for use on an empty stomach. 




 I guess we disagree, haha.  I think it's disrespectful to unnecessarily limit the range of today's artists on the basis of what a past generation did. 




 And the endless suburban sprawl heat island thing 




 Eh...it's a powerful, fairly obvious image.  I don't think there having been one great album with that title should preclude its use in other artwork indefinitely. 




 That is not necessarily true.  It could be that pizza shops of that size, profit margin, and rent are no longer viable businesses. 




 Geordi killed the shapeshifting alien with his phaser in Aquiel (Season 6). 




 Wesley took part in illegal maneuvers with the academy flight team that resulted in one member's death (bit of a stretch) in Season 5. 




 I think there is definitely influence, but nothing nearly this strong.  I've witnessed several DMT-naive people - people who had little or no exposure to writings on DMT, to whom the experience had not been particularly talked up - use DMT for their first time.

Not all of the people whose first time's I've witnessed experienced explicit entity contact, but all reported a sense of contact with another presence or consciousness, and about half reported explicit contact with entities external to themselves.

This, combined with the general culture around DMT, and the results of Rick Strassman's work with it, have been enough to convince me that DMT has a direct effect on humans that tends to produce entity contact experiences.

In my view, it takes quite a lot more mental gymnastics and evidence denial to believe that DMT *doesn't* have some entity contact experience producing effect.  

edit:  I remain agnostic as to the actual nature of these experiences.  It seems quite clear to me that nobody knows what's going on with them, except in those cases where the experience is clearly generated from one's personal psychology. 




 That's not true in many industries.  Labor is often the largest single cost by far, especially in service industries.  This is almost certainly true for the restaurant in the article.

According to the article, the owner has 12 employees.  The minimum wage went up by ~$4.  Supposing the workers average a 30 hour work week, the new minimum wage likely cost an additional ~$7000 a month.

Profit margins are usually quite low for small restaurants.  $7000 a month isn't trivial. 




 Heh...no need to be rude.  It's not such a difficult error to make. 




 I think you missed my point.  What do you think the gap of 80.2 represents?  Do you believe that it represents a difference in pay between men and women working similar jobs with similar levels of experience and education? 




 There are only 4 participants in that study, and comparisons are only made within subjects. :/ 




 The supplement's label answers your question.  To be sold in the United States, supplements must conform to very specific labeling requirements.  Notice that the label states zinc content, *not* zinc monomethionine content.  It also states the % of the FDA's recommended intake.

Serving Size: 1 Tablet

Zinc (as zinc monomethionine [OptiZinc])	30 mg	200%

Take one tablet a day or less.  Don't take more - excessive zinc supplementation can hurt you fairly easily. 




 Yes - this could be a great improvement on existing treatment.  But it's true that this treatment is little more than a revision of the L-dopa approach.

Can't make enough dopamine?  Buy these magic nano-dopamine pills from me for the rest of your life...  




 Sure thing - glad to help.

I'd just buy a creatine supplement, the cheapest simplest one you can find, and take the recommended dose for a few days before the test (including the morning of the test).

Drink whatever feels normal, then add a half gallon or so to that.  You don't want to give them a water sample, but you do want it to be dilute.  You can get a feel for this by doing a test run where you take the B-vitamin supplement and drink a ton of water, then see if your urine is still yellow. 




 I agree.  It is still worth discussion - and worth investigating, understanding better, and changing.  But that doesn't change the fact that it is disingenuous for a politician to use misleading figures such as the 78% gap to try to gain support from ignorant voters.

Bernie Sanders apparently called out for "equal pay for equal work" to correct a 78% pay gap that **does not exist**.  That is objectionable. 




 Nobody can reasonably claim that there is no gender gap at all - but the gap is only substantial when differences in career choice, hours worked, and years worked are ignored.  If you read the linked sources in their entirety you will see that they support Gottlob's position and undermine the position that a substantial gap exists.

The numbers you've quoted do not take these factors into account. 




 He should do it in short videos that show a before / during / after of him enjoying the product. 




 It's really just down to how you feel about it.  There won't be any danger nor any cross-tolerance.

I don't think it's a big deal.  If you feel up to it and want to trip again, go ahead. :) 




 The method I linked to addresses this, has for a decade+.  You just supplement creatine; creatinine is a metabolite of this. 




 The artist works in a grocery store. 




 Hopefully that's just for the scans... 




 Being slim may give you some advantage, as THC and its metabolites are stored in fat.

Drinking water will not increase the rate at which your body processes and excretes THC and its metabolites - that is false.  The rate depends on things like liver enzymes and fat metabolism, not urination and kidney filtration.  Exercising may, as it could increase the turnover of THC and metabolites stored in your body fat.  This is more likely to be of importance to an overweight person with a heavy load of THC / metabolites in their fat; for you as a slim, light user who has plenty of time to abstain, it is unlikely to matter.

I think your chances are quite high.  Obviously, there's no good data on this; no scientist would study this, there's no reason and no grant money.  But I have personally passed a couple tests this way under worse conditions than yours, and have seen friends do the same.  This advice is quite old - I first used it nearly a decade ago - and there are many anecdotal reports online spanning that entire time period, of people using it successfully.

For what it's worth, if I were in your shoes, I wouldn't sweat it.  If you want some assurance, you could do a home test using this method a week from now and see if you pass.  Or you could even pay a testing company to do you, if the job is really important.  Just don't use the same one as your employer, haha. :) 




 Ah - good reply, you gave a ton of useful info.

You should be able to pass if it's at least two weeks away, and you're willing to abstain completely until the test. :)  It wouldn't be worth trying to pass a fake sample unless the situation makes it quite easy, or abstaining would be extremely stressful.

Employers rarely do drug testing themselves, but instead have you go to a testing company that they pay to collect and analyse your sample.  Often there will be somebody watching you through a one-way mirror.  Not right in front of you, but back and to the side.  So there is some privacy, but not too much.

If they are conducting their own test using a cheap kit, then you can probably pass that with ease through simple dilution + B vitamins - and you can predict the result by testing yourself as you suggested.

But even with the lab testing (which is cheap and quite common), you have every reason to believe you can pass.  
[Just follow the standard method summarized here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/33vb0i/i_have_to_pass_a_drug_test_in_three_weeks_and_i/cqop3vx)
 




 It really depends on what drugs you use, how often and at what doses, how soon the test is, and on how likely you are to succeed if you attempt to use something other than your own urine.

In most drug test/screen (synonymous) situations, it would actually be quite difficult to deliver anything but your own urine, coming out of your own body, without being detected.  It is also pretty easy to clean up your own urine if you have a few days (most drugs) or a few weeks (marijuana) of lead time.  Therefore, it is usually preferable to use your own urine and try to make it as clean as possible.

How soon is the test, and what will it involve? 




 Sure, that seems fair enough.  But I guess nobody else in /r/trees cares about the actual definition of socialism. 




 This isn't the question though.  OP wants to understand *why*. 




 It's reasonably likely that clonazepam that can be absorbed sublingually can also be absorbed through insufflation. 




 **ALWAYS.** :O 




 Expiscor is correct in their assessment that socialism requires collective ownership of the means of production and an overthrow of capitalism.

That doesn't mean socialism and communism are one and the same; it just means they share this feature.

This isn't a matter of public opinion, but of political science.
 




 No - ephedra is legal, though much more difficult to get in the US these days.  Though in many regions, it can be found growing in great abundance.  It is very easy to make tea from, but basically impossible to dose accurately unless you have prior experience and are willing to titrate the dose (start small, slowly build up).

Supplements derived from it are illegal, though. 




 I don't know; a quick google search should turn up a range of recommendations.  Ephedrine is sometimes used as a bronchodilator for people with asthma; if you're reasonably young and healthy, you probably can't go wrong using dosage recommendations for that as a starting point. 




 Well, sure - low gi filling foods + calorie counting are a pretty good way to create a caloric deficit without feeling like you're starving yourself.  But that alone won't prevent muscle loss while dieting; you need to lift, eat enough protein, and use a reasonable deficit and cycle length.

Stimulants have long been popular with dieters because they allow you to more easily create and tolerate the caloric deficit.  You can't lose much weight without changing your diet; EC stack will not create a deficit large enough on its own.  But it can make dieting easier. 




 I can't say whether you should or shouldn't, but assuming you're in good health and not at risk for heat stroke or something (e.g. you don't work outdoors in the heat all day, you aren't a senior citizen) it hardly seems like a big deal.  Lots of things increase your body temp.  If you get too hot, you'll feel too hot.  As long as you're in a situation where you can sweat and drink water, and find relief if necessary, I don't see a problem. 




 Jackolysis is right, as far as I know; you can buy it in any pharmacy.  But it's kept behind the counter in some regions, because of abuse potential.  It's still a non-prescription medicine, though, so you can just walk up and ask for it.  If they want to know why, you could say your doctor told you to use it for your cough/asthma/etc.

As for Ephedra...I don't see any advantage.  It's the same active chemical.  But using a pharmaceutical version allows you to take precisely measured doses, which is very important for safety and comfort when using strong stimulants. 




 If you want to lose fat, you have to eat less energy than you use; there is no way around this, none at all.

Whether you create an energy deficit with supplements + diet + exercise, or just diet, or diet+exercise, you have to deal with potential loss of muscle mass. 




 [Asked once before, apparently has worked for one person](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/24mwrc/lexapro_escitalopram_and_lsd/) 




 Just because an act is performed by a group does not mean that it is a communal effort.

And just because each individual in the group has their own selfish motives, doesn't mean the act isn't collective.  It's a false dichotomy.

Looting has a necessary collective aspect, which is that it involves a group of people all shoplifting together (as All-the-post-leftist pointed out). 




 Certain stimulants can be used to make the not eating and cardio easier, and to give a *modest* boost to resting fat metabolism.  Everything else is either bullshit or has such a small effect that it really isn't worth worrying about. 




 Good to know; do you know why it's not recommended? 




 ECA stack (ephedrine / caffeine / aspirin).  Won't kill you unless you already have heart disease, in which case it'll kill you.  Works primarily by destroying your appetite, but also increases thermogenesis.

Most other fat burning supplements are lies and/or unicorn tears. 




 In short - no.  His work can't be ELI5ed.  But if you put some effort into reading *Being and Time*, as H_C_Everybody suggested, and then come back and ask for clarification, you'll probably be able to wrap your head around it with minimal effort. 




 Sure, I mean, that sounds great...but so what?  I enjoyed the Power of Now and feel that it's a valuable book.  I've recommended the book to friends before.

But I still find it disingenuous of Eckhart Tolle to present other people's ideas, slightly reworded and simplified, without offering readers some mention of the context these ideas came from.

To be fair, he often mentions other traditions in his work.  But I found he also often left out the source of his ideas.

It's a reasonable critique. *shrug* 




 Sure.  We could easily agree to condemn looters, but it remains utterly irrelevant to the larger political action that occurred / is occurring in the form of riots and demonstrations sans looting.

A minority of participants looted, yet media have been successful at making looting a huge part of every conversation about the riot.  Why? 




 Great analysis.  There may be room for some extremely useful innovations with things like high value craigslist purchases, car sales by owner, etc, if a good in-person sale escrow system can be implemented. 




 If you're open to using powders, you can save a lot of money by purchasing bulk powder supplements online - especially on things like EGCG, 5HTP, and joint supplements. 




 Instead of trying to figure out what it is, why don't you just do it with your friends repeatedly...and gradually slip in turns of phrase used by Vulcans.  If you start slow, you could eventually cultivate a local group of trippers who get together to take a drug called Logic and talk like Star Trek cosplayers.

Isn't that possibility more important than determining the exact identity of this substance?

Logic demands it! 




 /r/iamverysmart 




 That isn't a fair assessment at all.  *Some* people seem to have taken advantage of the situation to loot.  So what?  That doesn't make the entire effort illegitimate. 




 That's disgusting...and what the fuck does it have to do with /r/trees ?  Come on. 




 I have, at least most of it.  I haven't looked at any of Eckhart Tolle's work in a few years now.  I enjoyed *The Power of Now* a lot.

I found it very accessible, but somewhat disingenuous in that his work is extremely derivative - at times, to the point that he is simply restating Buddhist teachings in simplified form - but he often presents his ideas as though they're original. 




 You're not broken. You're just less attached to the material world. 

Ehh...to me, that really feels like writing a fairy tale about why it's ok not to feel sad about it.  Just because OP isn't having a natural and expected emotional reaction to the death of a loved one, doesn't mean it's because OP isn't attached to the material plane.

It seems more likely that OP is emotionally repressed, disconnected.  Maybe intellectually dominated.

Nothing to celebrate or bemoan, but something that can easily pass with some space and time.

OP if it bothers you, you might try setting aside more time to exist in your body, without a goal or purpose.  Like, time to watch clouds go by and walk down the street aimlessly or to do yoga or something. 




 [HAIL CORPORATE](/r/hailcorporate) 




 It appears to only count one vote per IP. 




 You're welcome, yeah.  I wish I had a good article handy to link to; you could probably find one in /r/kava .

The reason I used alcohol is because it is widely used, has a long history of human use, and is generally recognized as safe for daily use in strict moderation (1 or 2 drinks, depending on your liver capacity).  It is very dangerous for regular use at higher doses, and in single very high doses.

But it serves as a good comparison, I think, because most people will accept a drug that is safer than alcohol as safe for daily use. 




 I've always found a better price per gram of DHA/EPA by buying it in softgels.  It's also more convenient if you're travelling to have pills instead of a bottle.

Just be sure you're comfortable with whatever number of pills you'll have to swallow to get the dose you want.  A lot of companies offer really low dose softgels that aren't worth the inconvenience. 




 My understanding is that there are a couple of very specific scientific findings and a lot of speculation in that paragraph, but that there is no clear evidence for the timeline you propose.  Do you have a reference for that timeline? 




 This is what I mean, though.  You're assuming the worst about this person's assumptions.  They're been quoted saying 

This research is unethical.

and you've taken that to mean something like "genetic modification in humans is unethical, both now and for the foreseeable future."

You say that 

He's saying even researching the concept to learn how to do it safely is wrong.

But how do you know?  Perhaps what he said was in the context of a reasonable, though bold, critique of this specific experiment.

Even if his comment was in fact meant in the worst possible interpretation, by giving a charitable interpretation, you could add something to the discussion by exploring reasonable critiques to this sort of research, instead of childishly lampooning an obviously untenable position. 




 That isn't actually quite true.  The kava liver toxicity was from extracts sold in pill form, occurred in a very small number of people relative to the number of people using it, and hasn't recurred.

Yet even if that level of toxicity occurred at that same frequency in traditional kava use (which it doesn't), it would still be safer than alcohol - which is well known to cause liver toxicity with regular use.  :) 




 That hardly seems like a charitable interpretation.  It seems quite obvious to me that reasonable, well-informed people can disagree about the ethics of human genetic engineering at this stage of scientific understanding. 




 Oh come on. :/

Everybody knows that rectal administration is the only way for a modern Kantian; the science-camera-hole method died out in the mid-90s (thank goodness it did).

Other than that, I'd say this is about right, and certainly enough to cover the scope of your assignment. 




 Whatever, dude.  If you have good information to the contrary, please share it.  Otherwise, I'll remain agnostic about the exact threshold of MDMA neurotoxicity in humans... 




 Haha...yeah, that's pretty much it for side effects for folks with a reliable pharmaceutical grade source who don't do risky combinations and either don't IV or use correct IV practices.

Doesn't seem like a bad deal until you do the price math... 




 To be fair, I didn't say that it was - only that it certainly isn't safe any more frequently.  It's possible that people can safely take low-moderate doses of MDMA every week or two; I don't think it's known either way. 




 Try practicing mindfulness meditation, following your breath.  You can get instruction easily by going to local meditation group if you haven't already learned, or if you aren't able from a book.  This way, you can hone your awareness and ability to place that awareness on an object, and thereby observe more closely what is happening with these visions.

Most likely they will pass on their own, and aren't of any real consequence. 




 Fair enough... 




 What makes you think that it's true?
