 Treat drugs as a medical problem and not a militarized police problem. Treat political extremists as a political or criminal problem, not a military problem. 




 tru 




 great post 




 dont see how to flari a post oops  OFF-TOPIC 




 yea! mod me ~  




 Europe is underpopulated  




 When will it happen? 




 And the markets are still separate

 "The fundamental error Chandler makes in this video is that the "unloading" of the upper floors' weight on the lower half only occurs until the the upper floors impact it. The impact, if you want to use the "block" analogy , is much greater that the original static load and it impacts on only one floor in this simple model. If this implact is greater than the floors ability to withstand it (it's dynamic load rating) then the floor will come apart. (I'm not arguing the model, as it's kind of silly, just that even if you try to use it, his conclusions ignore this point.)

Try this simple math - let the upper 13 floors weigh one pound each, so the weight pressing down on the "lower block" is 13 pounds on 9/10/2001. The detached upper block accelerates on 9/11/2991 for 12 (distance between floors) feet at 18 feet per second (Chandler's video) so the terminal velocity of the block is roughly10 feet per second. F=1/2 MV^2, so the thirteen blocks exert an impact of (13*10*10)/2=650 lbs on the top floor of the block. If this is greater than the design load of the floor - or its weakest links, then it will come apart at those points. Note the huge difference between 13 and 650 in terms of load. The next floor impact is even worse as the constant acceleration means that the velocity is greater (from Chandler) and so the force is even greate by the SQUARE of the velocity (and the mass might be up by a bit too).

 I was kind of shocked at the number of kids we had that believed this shit when I was studying civil engineering. That probably explains why they got C's or D's in dynamics though!

I'll elaborate slightly. I don't build or design buildings. I build roads; they're what I know and am good at. However, I have taken two structural analysis and design courses, as well as a steel design course, so I imagine that puts me at or above 98% of the general public when it comes to understanding how the towers fell. 

Here goes; when you build a building there's basically two types of loadings you'll design for: static and dynamic. Static loadings are the loads on a structure that don't change; desks, computers, filing cabinets, the actual weight of the building itself, stuff like that. Dynamic loadings are a bit trickier as they can move; people, water from rain/snow on the roof, wind, seismic, etc. You get the idea. 

I'm not certain on the Factor of Safety (FOS) used for the Towers' design, but let's assume it was 2. What that means is in a static situation, all other things being equal and there being no dynamic forces acting on the building (a perfect classroom scenario, obviously not real world), you'd basically be able to stack one tower on top of the other and it would be able to support it. 

It gets trickier with dynamic loading because in theory you could have all of the weight focused on a minute point, which you obviously couldn't design for as it would require truly massive structural members to support so dynamic FOS is, let's say, 1.1. 

Once the first floor started to accelerate downwards, the was nothing that could stop the floor below it from failing immediately after the dynamic load hit it. Now you've got two floors falling, then three, and so on. For the buildings to be sturdy enough to handle a moving weight like that falling even 10 feet would require gargantuan beams. I'm taking beams that are 4 feet tall (looking at it where it makes an "I") and weigh several hundred pounds per foot. Something that heavy could not support itself. 

Another thing to mention is the whole steel beams thing. Everyone needs to shut the hell up about "jet fuel can't melt steel beams" bullshit. It didn't have to melt the beams. All it had to do was weaken them. Steel loses 70% of its tensile strength at only 25-30% of it's melting point, which was definitely reached during the fires. For those of you playing along at home, that would mean the building would have had to have been built with an FOS of 4 or more, which is not feasible financially, and quite possibly structurally. I would also be remiss if I didn't mention that our quality control standards in the 70's weren't nearly as good as they are today. Is venture as well that the quality of the materials used aren't as good as they are now. 

I know only a few will see this, but I hope it might help you explain it to the layman that believes all of this bullshit.  




 and i commit a crime with all the weed i smoke everyday but aint nobody deporting me 




 wouldnt u take a risk to see ur mom, kids, etc again? 




 the only time /r/kappa has upvoted subzero 




 how lucky for them
 




 non predatory? they bought the whole world and sit on their money... fake socialists 




 you sound about as libertarian as norway is "socialist" 




 yea id rather have james chen over spooky most of the time.. mostly because spooky usually commentating weeklys, very lazy-like 




 10 fucking years in prison for leaking stratfor e-mails.. 




 have u been in the streamline courts?? 50 defendants/lawyer/day?  wtf is this shit 




 OPERATION STREAMLINE: There is one lawyer for all 23 men. Federal public defender Matthew Johnson says he's handled up to 50 defendants by himself in one day. Compare this with defenders in Tucson, where each lawyer may represent four to six clients at a time. 




 id be happy too if i was born in a country that controlled 1% of all wealth on earth despite being .00083% of the population! 




 Acts of civil disobedience are in line with the principles of equality that governed my life  I felt I had an obligation to use my skills for justice and bring the truth to light, he said.

But Judge Preska disagreed with Hammond that his hacktivism was a form of civil disobedience.

"These were not the actions of Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela, John Adams or even Daniel Ellsberg [who handed over the Pentagon Papers], said Preska in closing. In his own words, Mr. Hammond had a stated goal of creating maximum mayhem.

Among other items, Hammond was found guilty of the Dec. 2011 hack into the computer systems of global intelligence firm Strategic Forecasting Inc., or Stratfor. Speaking about that hack, Preska had equally strong words.

His goal was, citing Hammond's own words at the time, to destroy the target, hoping for bankruptcy, collapse."

 /r/postnationalist is willing to hear whatever LOGIC you have 

dont expect much.. 




 And yet the country still taxes the hell out of their subjects where a person barely out of poverty owes 36% of everything they make to the State. The more things change...

 sorry im not gonna bother using archive whatever cuz ur dumbass cant handle a link to eventhubs 




  -labor is divided. the illegal immigrants/furriners are used as a bargaining chip to push down the wages for the local people, and the answer is NOT to join forces with your employer against the foreign labor

 




 **super alpha postnationalism FAQ**

-founded as a counter-jerk to the prevailing western attitude- against foreigners, against outsourcing, against immigrants, which i believe is mostly founded on a "fuck you got ours" 

ie: "socialist" norway, 1 trillion $ oil fund, huge landmass, still no room for immigrants. australias white immigration policy, americas 10 year waiting lists etc.

-veganism says species:discrimination, we declare some species lower and then eat them. the same thing happens with our global caste system.

-labor is divided. the illegal immigrants are used as a bargaining chip to push down the wages for the local people, and the answer is NOT to join forces with your employer against the foreign labor

-US vs THEM mentality, ww3, hitler. nationalism leads to war over scarce resources. dehumanizing other nations peoples and demanding your nation is #1 etc. 

**WHAT IS THE FUTURE OF POSTNATIONALISM?**

 We believe foremost that if someone but simply wishes to learn, they have every right to access the highest forms and modes of education available on this planet; since this is not a reality we must begin somewhere.
This is why we also believe that if someone but simply wishes to read any book, they should have access to that book for free no matter what. 




 why not?

 An argument made in the film is that there is no reason why the Federal Reserve System should have a monopoly on the U.S. money supply. The film asserts that "America got along just fine before the Federal Reserve came into existence." This leads the film to the question of why the Federal Reserve System was created. The film contends that the U.S. Congress has no control or oversight over the Fed, and hence has no control over the value of U.S. money. The film argues that Congressional control over the value of money is required by Article 1, Section 8 of the United States Constitution. The phrase in question (clause 5) states that the United States Congress shall have the power "To coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin..." The film includes a call to action to abolish the Federal Reserve. In 2007, the Boston Globe stated that Congressman Ron Paul, "says he doesn't agree with all the film's arguments, but he says the film had 'a huge impact' on the support his campaign is drawing",[2] a reference to Paul's presidential bid in 2007 and 2008.
