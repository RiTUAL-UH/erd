 A real human bean 




 I am from Canada as well and I have seen commercials for the Canadian army. They were really high-quality too. 




 So let's say episodes 7-9 all turn out to be successful, what would you think about a remake of episodes 1-3 (assuming that is legally possible)? They would stick to the same storyline and plot relatively, but get rid of things that were quite obviously failures, and maybe add some new things in to make it feel like a different movie, and fix George Lucas' problems. Then these prequels would replace the old ones as canon, and the old ones could be called the "Jar Jar Trilogy" or something and will basically be referred to as Star Wars' blunder years. 

I think it could definitely work if done correctly. The prequels are actually a great story, just not told very well, in my opinion. What do you think about this? 




 Because I still haven't seen Star Wars: The Force Awakens. And yes, I'm being completely serious. 




  It provokes the desire, but it takes away the performance. Therefore, much drink may be said to be an equivocator with lechery. It makes him, and it mars him; it sets him on, and it takes him off; it persuades him, and disheartens him; makes him stand to and not stand to; in conclusion, equivocates him in a sleep, and, giving him the lie, leaves him.
