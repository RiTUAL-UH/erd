 "The quake occurred at a depth of less than two miles, which is considered shallow, and potentially more damaging than quakes emanating from deeper down.

The USGS previously rated the temblor at 7.5 magnitude but later upgraded the strength. The USGS reported aftershocks at strengths of 6.6 and 5.1." 














 "Comcast and Time Warner Cables decision to end Comcasts proposed acquisition of Time Warner Cable is in the best interests of consumers," Wheeler said. "The proposed transaction would have created a company with the most broadband and the video subscribers in the nation alongside the ownership of significant programming interests."

He added: "Today, an online video market is emerging that offers new business models and greater consumer choice. The proposed merger would have posed an unacceptable risk to competition and innovation, including to the ability of online video providers to reach and serve consumers."

And he said: "I am especially proud of our close working relationship throughout the review process with the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice. Our collaboration provided both agencies with a deeper understanding of the important issues of innovation and competition that the proposed transaction raised.

 "A farm east of Hawley, Minnesota is preparing for the worst after initial tests come back presumably positive for avian flu.

As Valley News Live first reported Tuesday, more than 300,000 may have to be destroyed if the test is confirmed positive. Amon Baer says the birds are all contained and there are no eggs on store shelves."

Different source:
"It may be too late for the Red River Valley to contain the avian flu. Valley News Live has learned a farm just southeast of Hawley, Minnesota may have to destroy hundreds of thousands of chickens after initial test results come back positive for avian flu. We first met Amon Baer nearly two years ago when summer's heat took a toll on his chickens. Now, he'd rather take the heat over what he's looking at, a presumed positive test for avian flu. "We've been very vigilant in trying to monitor the birds and watch them for any signs of disease," Baer said. Baer said he works with around 300,000 chickens on his farm every day. He noticed Monday something wasn't right with about 30 of them. "I know what a healthy bird looks like and these looked a little sick, under the weather, breathing difficulty, a little foaming from the mouth," Baer said. What Baer doesn't know is how some of his birds came down with the virus, though wild waterfowl are known for carrying it. "We don't have wild geese or ducks in the barn. I don't know how it would have transferred from the waterfowl into the building," Baer said. Now the building will have to be emptied. All 300,000 chickens will likely be wiped out completely once the final test comes back. A livelihood put on hold. "It's very deflating. I've been in the business for 50 years and we've never had a disease outbreak on the farm to speak of that amounted to anything," Baer said. A hit to the Baer Brothers Farm that was luckily caught early. "They have a 48 hour period. None of the eggs that would have been quarantined here have gotten into any customers hands," Baer said. The USDA and APHIS will be out on the farm Wednesday to work out a plan to compost all of the birds. Baer said a final test result is expected then as well.

 "...Oklahomas government on Tuesday embraced a scientific consensus that earthquakes rocking the state are largely caused by the underground disposal of billions of barrels of wastewater from oil and gas wells."

"In past decades, Oklahomans experienced only about one and a half earthquakes exceeding magnitude 3.0 in an average year. But since a boom in oil and gas exploration began in the mid-2000s, that number has mushroomed. The state recorded 585 quakes of 3.0 or greater last year, more than any state except Alaska, and is on course to register more than 900 such tremors this year."

"Larger quakes have also occurred. A series of shocks in 2011 exceeding magnitude 5.0 caused millions of dollars in damage. Some seismologists have warned that the state is risking larger and more damaging quakes unless it acts to reduce the number of tremors."

It does raise questions about long-term infrastructure cost. It is something weve got to consider. I am a big proponent of natural gas and what it could do for energy independence in this country. The question of how and where we should be doing it is what we need science to help us figure out. Its good city policy if we know what the safest way to extract it is."

  Before the occurrence of probable injection-induced earthquakes in the Dallas-Fort Worth area in 2008, the historic seismicity record includes only one felt earthquake within the 140,000km2 Fort Worth Basin.  The recent increase in US seismicity is not a natural phenomenon but is instead caused by human practices, primarily wastewater injection.

My real question of course is 'Why?'.

The physical causes are very nicely explained in your link, tyvm! I suppose that means my real question is 'How' did this happen?  No!, I do not please! wish to hear a long winded explanation of climate warming from the start of time, tyvm:)

 I'm wondering if 'the blob'  (http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/04/10/californias-drought-and-the-weird-warm-blob-in-the-pacific-that-may-be-fueling-it/) is messing with their sonar somehow...of course I am also wondering if the 4-corner methane gas pileup is causing 'the blob'.  

Stuff flows from a higher concentration to a lower usually, so if the methane is retaining heat why would the blob move?

 If the methane is the result of underground shifts, well then they may all be tied up in one scary package, no?

 




 no the part about 11 years x months is the minimum time he has left to serve, "Kurti was given a minimum tariff of 12 years, but will have to serve another 11 years and four months before he can be considered for parole due to time spent in custody awaiting trial."

 Does anyone have a current comparative chart of international recidivism rates? 

I can only seem to find rather old information. 




 yea that really needs to be changed.   




 I warned you:)  OK but the article says "The NRAO isn't happy. The iRobot lawnmowers would be using a frequency range they say is reserved for their telescopes -- 6240 to 6740 MHz."

I read that the common walkie talkies people use, use 462 and 467 MHz in the ultra high frequency (UHF) band. according to the Family Radio Service wiki. I noticed the RC stuff run at a lower 
frequency as well.  http://rcvehicles.about.com/od/frequency/p/US-RC-Frequencies.htm

u/marmz1 said something about the frequencies used by the RC folk requiring line-of-sight.

So that has me wondering if using these lower frequencies coupled with digital spectrum modulation wouldn't overcome that objection.

I'm thinking it's a cost thing, but honestly I don't know enough to know.

If you get a moment, would you please ELI5 why this wouldn't resolve the issue of tripping over the astronomers wavelengths? 

Thanks! 




 I'm trying to overcome the objections to using a different frequency, such as those made above by u/marmz1 




 http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/29/magazine/the-radical-humaneness-of-norways-halden-prison.html is a pretty good read.

Recidivism rates in Norway are far lower than those in the states.
 




 A way this robot can run without interference with the astronomers wavelengths.  I get a little tenacious sometimes. 




 would using DSM (Digital Spectrum Modulation) technology make any sense or is it too expensive ?
 




 thanks! 




 thank you. one more :)

 why would it be problematic for these robots to run using the walkie-talkie frequencies?

Shouldn't be that difficult to set up individual, buyer-set programs using these, no?  I'm just guessing here.

 There was no vote put to the public to approve the sale apparently. It seem's rather outrageous that one man alone have the decision making power on public land sales. Not even a referendum vote? Really??

'State Department of Natural Resources Director Keith Creagh approved the land transfer after a seven-hour public meeting that lasted into Thursday evening.'...

'An earlier version of the plan had been opposed by Mr. Creaghs senior staff. The staff endorsed an amended plan earlier this month after royalty rates to the state nearly doubled. In Michigan, Mr. Creagh said he has the power to sell public land as part of his mission to safeguard the environment and promote responsible economic development.'

 Man, I was trying to find the milk question..can't link it but The Telegraph reads like this:

British-born farmer quizzes Vladimir Putin on price of milk in live phone-in
John Kopiski engages Russian president in conversation about milk production during Mr Putin's annual marathon phone-in


A farmer born in Britain called John was one of the first Russian citizens to quiz Vladimir Putin during his annual marathon phone-in.

Sporting a Tolstoyan white beard and speaking in heavily accented Russian, John Kopiski engaged the president in a conversation about milk production.
Mr Kopiski, a father of five with a Russian wife who has been a Russian citizen since 1997, told Mr Putin that he had 1,700 head of cattle producing 10,000 litres of milk each a year, but that he couldn't make enough money because of low prices for his product.

The farmer, who lives in the Vladimir region near Moscow, suggested to Mr Putin that his aides might be fearful of telling him about the real state of the economy.
"You have the statistics and according to them everything is good," said Mr Kopiski, after Mr Putin had reeled off figures suggesting an economic upturn. "Do you believe in the statistics that you are shown? Or do are you lied to, because they're afraid to tell you the truth, or is something else not right with these statistics?"

Mr Putin appeared amused and inquired how Mr Kapiski had come to be in Russia, asking if was "Cherchez la femme? Looking for a wife?"
The president then said that he trusted the statistics provided to him and he was aware of farmers' problems.
"And of course we will raise state support," he said. "I think the government will have to do that."

With his distinctive looks and unusual background, John Kopiski admits he has become something of a celebrity in the small world of Russian milk producers.

So when a member of the countrys dairy producers' union asked him to speak up on the troubled industrys behalf, he agreed - provided, he said, that he was allowed to tell Putin the truth.
I got an invitation out of the blue, and at first I wasnt sure about it. Then I was told I could ask whatever I wanted so I said yes. I wrote the question myself and I didnt have to show it to them in advance, he told the Telegraph after the event.

Mr Kopiski, a former London coal and steel trader, moved to Russia in 1992 after falling in love with the country on a business trip. He subsequently married, converted to Russian Orthodoxy, and took citizenship in 1997.
Since 2004 he and his Russian wife, Nina, have invested millions in developing the Rozhdestvo dairy farm in the Vladimir region.

The farm has been hailed as a showpiece success in a sector still dominated by out-dated, Soviet-era practices. But despite massive success, Mr Kopiski has yet to recoup a single kopeck of his investment.
The father of five said it would take at least four more years to pay off $3 million in loans, and his son has told him it would be mad for him to take on the family business when Mr Kopiski retires.

Dairy farmers across Russia are blighted, he says, by a lack of long-term credit, a dysfunctional subsidies system, and the reluctance of officials to admit that the official statistics they have been relying on for years are grossly over-optimistic.

The main point is, how long are we expected to carry on working for nothing? Thats what I feel I have been doing for 11 years now. If you found me a buyer who would take if off me for the money Ive put into it, Id sell like a shot. Its sad, but there it is, he said.

But Mr Kopiski says the experience has not dented his affection for his adopted country or his respect for Mr Putin, who he says is the only option for Russia at the current time.
If his accountants are putting dodgy figures in front of him, how is he meant to know what is going on? People have been congratulating me for asking a tough question. Well, if I was encouraged to ask a question like that, I hope it means it will provoke him to have a good look at the issue.

In the meantime, he says, he tries to remain upbeat.
As an Orthodox guy, one of the biggest sins is impatience, he said. Im 66 this year. You have some perspective at that age."

In an interview with Radio Free Europe last month, Mr Kopiski said: "I'm Russian, I'm at home here. If tomorrow we need to go to the front, to face Nato, I'll be the first to go."

 Final Summary, from different source,(Radio Free Europe, http://www.rferl.org/contentlive/putin-live-russians-q-and-a-liveblog/26959840.html)

"-- In his annual question-and-answer session with the public, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Western sanctions are aimed at restraining Russia, asserting that Moscow's role in the crisis and conflict in Ukraine are only a pretext for the punitive measures imposed by the European Union, United States, and other nations.

-- He said that "the Russian army is not in Ukraine," repeating Moscow's denial that it has sent troops to aid pro-Russian rebels.

-- Putin highlighted the recent rise of Russia's ruble currency, which has gained more than 20 percent in 2015 after a steep decline last year. He also touted high oil production figures and a good harvest. He said Russians are living longer and death rates decreasing.

-- Putin linked his decision to lift a ban on supplying Iran with surface-to-air S-300 missiles with what he said was Tehran's demonstrated desire to resolve a yearslong dispute over its nuclear program, which Western nations fear is aimed at developing nuclear weapons.

-- Putin took on comparisons that suggest parallels between the reigns of Adolf Hitler and Josef Stalin, saying that "Nazism and Stalinism cannot be put on the same desk...because the Nazis directly, openly, and publicly announced as one of their goals the annihilation of concrete ethnic groups -- Jews, Gypsies, Slavs."

-- He described the killing of opposition leader Boris Nemtsov as "tragic and shameful" and praised investigators for identifying and arresting five suspects days after Nemstov was gunned down steps from the Kremlin on February 27.

-- Putin said his country will never be a "vassal" of the United States. He said there are "superpowers" that "consider themselves the only center of power in the world."

 hmm... "Russian President Vladimir Putin, in a televised call-in show, referred specifically to Buzina's death saying it had been politically motivated.

"This is not the first political assassination. Ukraine is dealing with a whole string of such murders," Putin said during his annual call-in in Moscow, when asked about the murder." 









 It's 2, not 1.  "Serhiy Sukhobok, another noted Ukrainian journalist, was reported gunned down earlier in the day.

Media reports did not specify whether Sukhobok was killed in his native Donetsk region, in war-torn eastern Ukraine, or elsewhere"

 No, come over to our side! You and your kin haven't the numbers needed to defeat the nullness, but if...at the last moments, after the null army has finally pressed; you and your brethren press, then our joined people, the valid ones; shall triumph!!

possibly. Your second cut will be deep, but as the designated sword keepers of validity, you will need to keep it sheathed until the final, final, final..moment! or the one just before that actually. 




 Holy Smokes!  Fellow Purples!!!!  It is imperative that we convince all those fancy-colored yellow/blue/green folk to Press Again!! 

But not until most of the null-colors have pressed!  

The fancy pantsers will get a second strike, and a deep one!

Purple shall emerge valiant!! 




 so you want to make a 'donation'?? 




 I sure  hope so :))  Glad you got it all set to roll out :)

 I'm finding some reference (idk how good. it's late   I am sleepy) to the Utes having some skinwalker activity. These are from Utah:

http://www.rense.com/general77/skin.htm has a longish story of it,  taken from"Hunt for the Skinwalker: Science Confronts the Unexplained at a Remote Ranch in Utah"  ( By Colm A. Kelleher, George Knapp )

http://altereddimensions.net/2012/skinwalker-ranch  (think it's probably the same ranch,didn't check)

Ah ok it's well known I suppose: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skinwalker_Ranch  

https://personalghoststories.wordpress.com/2011/05/29/ute-skinwalker/   From comments section: "I had a bad experience in the San Luis Valley of Colorado." that's all she wrote..  .
 




 "In Argentina, Mr. Bozkir asserted, the Armenian diaspora controls the media and business."

 I hope so:) 

I think it's a matter of getting people to see it.  The gofundme is getting there.
