 Call of Wide: Wide at Wide. Did I do it right? 




 It can look good if you don't throw $30 worth of LEDS in a case and hope it looks good. 




 . omfg so good 









 I was expecting for them to put that one make up in their eye to make them entirely black. With someone doing a dick copter in the back to make it NSFW. 




 Holy fuck. That took a dark turn 




 This may seem like advertisement, but I assure you it isn't. It is raising awareness to a charity. If there are other places I could post this where it would be more relevant I would gladly do so, or you could. There is a charity going to get children in Detroit Hospital a "GO kart" which is a kiosk with a tv and everything hooked up so a child who can't leave their room, can still enjoy games. Currently Twitch streamer DanGheesling is doing this charity event to provide these. He has 4 hours left and is half way there. We, the PC gamers, could easily help him, even if we each gave 50 cents. (USD) This is a great charity I think we could support. Now there is one problem, they are xbones, but do you think a kid, who hasn't his bed in a month would give a fuck? If you are donating or even watching, cut the master race shit and support a good cause.

 I'm just pointing out, a black guy gets attacked, its on CNN. A white guy? Local news. Police brutality affects EVERYONE, not just black people. 




 TIL Exercise makes you unhealthy 




 Man, its a shame that ANOTHER black man has been hurt because of police brutality. Oh wait, it was a white cop AND a white civilian. It almost seems like this has to do with police being assholes and it not just being racial tension... huh

 Not a teacher but I found my principals twitter. She has zero tweets. But her profile picture is her riding a horse wearing a top hat. She is a 5 foot tall woman.  









 never heard of that. Link? 




 Is there a shark in your pocket or are you happy to see me? 




 Dammit. You beat me to the karma. D: 




 Takin' the downvotes like a champ! Kappa 




 Do I get mods with it? 




 I is nots sure if these is legit.  




 idk 




 Yeah, the soul isn't there. I have no idea how she even died. :/ Also, can I make weapon flamey or lightning? Like the Uchikatana, which I had been using up until the lightning spear. 




 All the weapons I have are taking forever. Any suggestions for weapons I should get? 




 What would be a good sword to use? 




 This is my first time with Dank Souls. I had a standard run I guess. Except my Quelaag fight. I don't know what happened. I fought her over and over again. Kept dying. After 69 times I go and she isn't there. I never got her soul. I cannot make Quelaags Fury Sword. From every lets play I see they ALWAYS use that sword. Is there any alternative to that sword that I could use in Anor Londo or if any of you have a Quelaag sword or souls that doesn't fit your build could I have it? Keep in mind I am a noob. Thanks! :D 




 666 is the sign of the anti-christ. In the bible people are marked with that to show that they are with the devil or some shit. I would expect the Mark would be the mark in the bible. Which it is. :p

 I'm joking. The game will look like BF4. Good on PC. Makes you cry on consoles. :p 




 Star Wars: Battlefront. The new one. That is coming out.. 




 Hello Chris! Let me say, I am a HUGE fan and love you as an actor. The question is, how long did it take you to lose weight and get buff for the role of Star-Lord. Also, would you consider making a workout CD. I would buy that. 




 This is probably what the graphics will look like in battlefront. :/ 




 WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT!!! THIS IS NOT TAKING TO SERIOUSLY! THIS RUINS THE ENTIRE KARMA ECONOMY!!!!11one Kappa 



















 It isn't a cross post. It wasn't the same poster. Two different posters is a repost. 




 Yeah, I guess. I would rather see unfunny shit than stolen shit. I mean, would you rather find a dollar on the road or would you want someone to take a dollar from you. 




 but Dean! The mother won't come back... 




 Really? A repost from a day ago from /r/4chan? I'm disappointed with you /r/funny...

 Not including this one, of course 









 Oh, yeah. Sorry I got confused. :p 









 Hey Chef! I will cut the crap and just ask you a question. Has someone ever been too good to get on the show? and have you ever had to cut the show because something happened like the building burned down, they were good, they were too shit, etc.?
