 Super sharp white cheddar cheese and cherry Capri Sun. 




 Outside where I went to school (both middle and high) was an extensive network of fountains. It was tradition on the last day of school to throw your friends in the water. It was also tradition that once they were picked up by your posse, you emptied their pockets and took off their shoes. 

My first time round, at the end of 7th grade, a boy pushed me into the water without taking such precautions. I'm sure it was a juvenile attempt at flirtation. My new cellphone (it was Japan, everyone had cellies) was in my pocket and got ruined. It was a Christmas present from my parents and I really treasured it, so I didn't want them to think I didn't care for my nice things...so I made him go tell my parents. I think he even wrote a note in which he managed to apologize a multitude of times - I remember my dad finding it absolutely hilarious. The young man moved that summer and I never saw him again.  




 **WARNING: RAMBLING ART POST AHEAD**

I am an (assistant) curator at an art museum, where *many* of my colleagues are artists. Many of them are quite successful in the local art scene. Every one of them still keeps their day job. It's not even be an issue of marketing. The fact of the matter is, that most artists, but especially drawings don't earn big art money, even when you can market and sell them well. Even masters' drawings don't comparatively sell for a lot. A recent Picasso drawing [sold for $123,750 at Christie's](http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/drawings-watercolors/pablo-picasso-deux-personnages-et-tete-5678112-details.aspx?from=searchresults intObjectID=5678112 sid=f2dd6a3f-ab0c-495b-a096-df2efccb3001). Which, granted is not chump change. But compare that to the [$106.5 million one of his paintings sold for in 2010](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/06/arts/06iht-melik6.html?_r=0). 

So I clearly understand that your friend is not Picasso, but go ahead and google "ink drawings for sale," and you'll probably find plenty of places selling prints. People who make money drawing make prints, because you can take your hours and hours of work and then sell it many times for a small(er) amount of money. If you're wise, an amount of money that the Average Joe is willing to shell out an an art fair, say $25-50 for an 8x10. Less for greeting cards.

The other thing is subject matter and the idea of an artist. Most people now-a-days think of the artist as a true, pure, creative soul unburdened by the practicalities of the world. This is a *fairly* recent concept, and throughout most of history artists were considered and considered themselves more like craftsmen. And like craftsmen, they were dependent on commissions and patrons. Most artists were **told** what to draw. Artists today can certainly do that. But I think savvy artists can take advantage of an existing market. Take a look at top etsy and deviantart sellers, they create art from fan-favorite shows, sports teams, universities, etc. People love to buy pretty art representing things they already love. 

So, for the unsolicited advice to nobody in particular: If you want to make money drawing, make beautiful drawings of the favorite historic building downtown or at your local university. Make prints, put it on mousepads and coffee mugs and greeting cards. Sell it at local stores. Frame the original and sell it for 10-15x the asking price of the print. 

You still might have to keep your day job. 

He is very talented though. :) 




 The tickets have been claimed, thanks! 




 Hey Pittsburgh! I just received two tickets at my workplace (out of the blue) to the [Silk Screen Asian American Film Festival](http://www.silkscreenfestival.org/). Only problem is, I live in Cincinnati and have no plans to make it out to Pittsburgh in the coming week! The festival is from Today (May 10th) through the 19th. They are $10 face value, and are good for admission to any film presentation at the Regent Square Theater, Melwood Screening Room, or the Carnegie Museum of Natural History. It does say it is not valid for special events.

If anyone would like these two tickets, I will gladly send them to you in the mail - just PM your address! 




 Please tell me this is called, [The Colors of the Wind](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diQgSDWJL7o) 




 There are a myriad of reasons why its happened over the centuries. Many early medieval manuscripts were cut up in the later medieval period to provide scrap material for the creation of new manuscripts (paste down pages and binding strips, etc.). Essentially they were using old-fashioned codices to create fancy new ones. Useful, in their eyes, especially as vellum was costly. Some of these fragments have been preserved because they were used in this way! This continued on for a long time. 

Nowadays, it still happens as rare book dealers can get a greater amount of money by breaking up a book rather than selling it complete. The best example of this is the Audubon Double-Elephant folio. Double-Elephant is a reference to the size of the paper. Audubon wanted to render the birds as life-size. So the large paper format allowed him to fit in the larger birds - many are [craning their necks to fit in the page.](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_U3smsd2mIlI/TMOBcAE-H9I/AAAAAAAAEKs/W1QC8zBbafA/s1600/American_Flamingo.jpg) He then issued these out as a series to subscribers. Not every subscriber went the full length of subscription, so a full set is fairly rare to begin with. The most recent set sold at auction for $11.5 million. Now, dealers will get a hold of these volumes and obviously want to make as much money as possible. So, instead of trying to find *one* buyer willing to spend $11 mill., they will find *many* buyers who are willing to spend some thousands to buy a *leaf* from the folio. Some of the large birds can go quite high, into the six figures. And often, when you add up the sale price of all of these individual prints, it will exceed the cost of the complete set. The prints are highly desirable as individual plates also, because they are easier for collectors to display and look great on a wall. 

I agree that it is awful. You should try and preserve things as much as possible. Some of the early stuff though happened 800+ years ago, and it's hard to get angry about it. It is part of the object's history and often is very enlightening to the period. The manuscript you looked at is very fine and quite complete - this isn't your typical example! There are tons of fragments and single leaves that can also be beautiful and illuminating.

 I just wrote a lengthy response to /u/element4l about my specific path. It was both a combination of education and practical experience.  




 Oh and I forgot to mention this in the tome I wrote above, but be aware of the programs. Frankly ranking and regard of program are considerations. At least in the United States, to work in any library you must have your MLS. This is somewhat problematic as there are wildly divergent needs at different types of libraries. Rare books and university librarians do generally need the rigor of a Master's program to best serve their patrons. Generally speaking, public librarians, school librarians, etc. shouldn't necessarily need a Masters degree. The perpetual complaint of reference librarians at many of these institutions is that they never actually answer reference questions - just where the bathroom is. Because of these disparate needs, there are many programs that cater more specifically to the latter group. If you are serious about Rare Books, Archives, or Museum work - you need to find a top program that has highly regarded specialties in your chosen field. For MLS programs, you need to look at the top tier and really investigate their specialty programs. 




 Thanks! I certainly think so! :) 




 Thanks! I find it to be - I absolutely love what I do. I wrote a very long response to /u/element4l above. Short story is that it's a life-long passion that I worked quite hard for.  




 Yes! Sorry for the out of the blue reference. It's very lightweight but quite durable. It's almost translucent. It was used a lot for carbon copies and for air mail correspondence (light weight = cheaper) in the past, so you do run across it a lot in manuscript collections.  




 Well, I will say it was a lot of hard work and a good dash of luck. I'm happy to share my story though. I absolutely love my job. I will give a word of warning that as you are already in you mid-twenties, you many have a steep road ahead of you. But nothing is impossible! This will be somewhat long!

**1. Education**
When I was an undergraduate I majored in History and Medieval Studies - a very interdisciplinary field that has served me well in both graduate school and my career. I then continued on to obtain my Master's in Library Science with a specialization in rare books and manuscripts. You can major in anything and go to Library school. There are also Museum studies programs that typically require an art history or history background, which can also be good options. Pay attention in your classes and develop relationships with professors in fields you are passionate about. When they know you really care about what you are doing, most professors are happy to help you in any way. Sit down and chat with them one-on-one. I went to a school that had very small class sizes and professors really cultivated student relationships which was wonderful. Ask them for advice. And yes, go talk to curators if you can. Start at your university's museum if they have one. We're busy folk, so you might not always get a response out of the blue. Try going to smaller museums in person and seeing if someone has the time to show you around and talk about their path. Everyone's is certainly not identical to mine.

**2. Language**
A big part of what helped me to get where I am is languages. I grew up in Japan and learnt Japanese, I then picked up Anglo-Saxon/Old English and Latin in college. Both of these helped me to be somewhat proficient in both Germanic and Romance languages, respectively. If you don't have a foreign language, start one today. Pick something that interests you and that pertains to the field in which you are most passionate. I learned dead languages because the objects I work with are written in them. If you are passionate about Greek art you better speak Greek. It is discouraging to many, but you will be a much better curator and you will be far more interesting to future employers with language skills. 

**3. Practical Experience**
When I was an undergraduate I worked in my university's library, just at the circulation desk, but was able to get some shifts in the very small rare books reading room from time to time. The minute I got to graduate school, I went to the rare books library and told them, "I want to work here, I'll do anything." Which worked, I was able to get an entry-level position that then allowed me to advance in the ranks.
While at graduate school, I did an internship with the curator of Manuscripts. I was able to time this well that I worked from start to finish on an exhibition of 100 medieval manuscripts. Also in this project we published a fully illustrated catalogue that was written by the leading expert in the field. I learned so much not only in terms of manuscript studies, but publishing, exhibition design, interdepartmental cooperation, and more. 

**4. Attitude and Decorum and Getting Your Foot in the Door**
 I cannot tell you how important a willing and cheerful attitude is. And not just when you are getting to handle the beautiful pieces. This is very important and I think would serve many people well, not just in the arts - **you have to be willing to do bitch work.** I know so many people who feel that it is beneath them to *insert menial task here* because they have a *insert higher degree here.* I have never had that mentality and always been a type of person who will pitch in to make things happen. I have quickly made myself a reliable and dependable person who is willing to just about anything to get the job done. Again, when I first started working at the rare books library, it wasn't anything glamorous - I essentially sat at a desk and made sure patrons didn't go into closed off areas. Was it bitch work? Yes. Did it require the amount of education I had already amassed? No. Did I whine about it? Absolutely not. I was happy to be there. And I met and became friends with everyone on staff. So two months later when a reference position opened up, guess who was at the top of the list to be promoted? THIS GIRL. I also made a point to dress professionally, even when it was not mandated. Most of the other student workers would wear normal casual clothes - t-shirts, jeans, etc. I never did and I noticed that I generally got treated more seriously by both staff and patrons. A second story to drive the point home: when I graduated I was job hunting and moved to a new city (for various reasons). Again, I went, *in person* and offered my services to even volunteer at a museum. They didn't have an open position but I began to volunteer a few times a week. (I was working other places at the time to support myself.) A few months later, an assistant curator position was funded, and having plenty of connections and friends at the museum I was able to easily get an interview and was hired.

I hope this helps answer some of your questions! If this generated more, please ask.  




 These programs are typically designed for someone going into a more traditional conception of librarianship. This would not be useful for someone interested in archives or rare book librarianship (different things, mind you!), both fields where practical experience with the physical objects is very highly regarded.  




 Thanks! I love what I do, and I both worked incredibly hard, but I also got very lucky. 

In undergraduate I majored in History and Medieval Studies - very interdisciplinary study which helped me greatly in graduate school and in my career. 

I also picked up a number of languages. I grew up in Japan where I learned Japanese. In college I studied Anglo-Saxon/Old English and Latin (both of which open doors to later Germanic and Romance languages, respectively). 

I obtained my Masters in Library Science, with a specialty in rare books and manuscripts. I went to a school that has a very highly regarded rare books library and program. Many Library schools don't have this, and a general MLS will typically not serve you well. Also, rare book library/museum work really values having worked with the art objects themselves.

Upon starting my program, I was able to get a job at the rare books library where I was able to work with amazing materials every day. I also got an internship in which I worked one-on-one with the Curator of Manuscripts. From start to finish on the creation of an exhibition and catalogue of medieval manuscripts. 

Upon graduation it was a combination of this practical experience, education, languages, plus a good dash of being in the right place at the right time that helped me get my current job as an assistant curator at an art museum.  




 It's certainly not the worst sin in the pantheon of rare books. For a fascinating and agonizing read, get a copy of [Cutting up Manuscripts for Pleasure and Profit](http://www.amazon.com/Cutting-up-manuscripts-pleasure-profit/dp/B0006QLXZ4).  




 Gesso is a form of sizing, which is a broad category which (at least in terms of gilding in manuscripts) refers to any substance which aids gold in adhering to the surface of the page. In medieval manuscripts in Western Europe gesso was far and away the most common. In early manuscripts, you do see other adhesives being used. The 'flatter' gold here, in the foliate border, is probably more likely to be shell gold, which is powdered gold that was mixed with gum arabic, creating a gold ink. The initials are still likely to have a gesso base.  




 First off, I'm a rare books librarian/curator whose specialty is medieval manuscripts. What other people have said regarding the use of gloves is absolutely true. Generally, most constrain your dexterity to be compromised with gloves, which is a big concern when turning pages of books or letters ( especially onion skin!). This, however, is not the case in every library, and you should always follow the rules of the institution. 

Another facet of vellum/parchment is that your hands can actually be beneficial. Vellum/parchment is untanned animal skin that has been treated in various ways. It is, in some ways, akin to leather. And just as leather is improved by periodic conditioning, so too is parchment. The natural oils in your hands can help to keep the parchment supple. Makes sure you don't have heavy lotions though. You must, however, be *very careful* to not touch any of the ink, pigment, or gold. This is much more sensitive. Just watch your  hands OP, that gold is very delicate! Its microns thick and applied to a layer of gesso (a chalk like substance). 

edit: I accidentally a word. 




 The key would be that we're talking about a great-grandfather. For most reddit users, their great-grandfathers were probably born in the late 19th century or early 20th. Most rural locales did not get electricity until later in the 20th. My own grandfather (not even great, mind you), grew up on a farm in Tennessee and remembers when they had their first lightbulb - probably in the mid-to-late 1930s. Given that this great-grandpappy was a rancher in Texas, they probably didn't have a electricity or a telephone and probably just rode his horse to visit his friends. 




 I think I remember the place! Never tried it though - I always saved my stomach space for [MOMIJI MANJU](http://i.imgur.com/SdFROwK) when heading to Miyajima!  




 Fellow Kobe-jin! Give me Kansai-style or give me death! Also, where's the mayo??  




 I want to shower you with sugar lumps, and ride you over fences! 




 We got a product called 'stimulo' which is essentially a tray with short tubes in which you put food. It helps the cat too slow down and simulates their kitty brains. But this should also be combined with portion control 




 I believe that it is actually a tenor recorder! I was in an early music consort in college, and they get even bigger (contra-bass are huge!); I never played on public transport though... 




 So, is there a subreddit for those sleeping with their cousins?? There's certainly enough of you.
 




 The real question is how Patrick Stewart got a hold of the Cup of Christ after it fellow in the crevasse. 




 Glad to hear you're in agreement! Peer review is a wonderful thing. 




 First off, I'm a rare book librarian/curator that specializes in Medieval Manuscripts. The notation method is known as [neumes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neumes), the predecessor to our modern musical notation. It appears as early as the 9th century, though this is obviously much later. To my eye this is definitely mid-15th century. It is written on vellum/parchment, and has been repaired with the same. 

You had a picture of the "interesting repair work"...this is some vellum from a smaller (in actual size) codex; you can tell from the line of prickings along the edge. [Parchment would be folded and pricked](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0akEes4NNw), that way, when the scribe was writing out the lines of text - they would be in a uniform spot throughout the codex. It looks like they got prick happy with the rest of the corner and ended up using it as repair spot.

The stitching was fairly common in poor quality vellum. When you create vellum/parchment it involves stretching the skin very tautly on a frame and then scraping it with a mezzaluna knife to remove skin, hair, etc. To an inexperienced maker, they can easily rip holes. Sometimes, they occur naturally - perhaps a cut on the animal prior to death. While finishing the vellum, they would sew up the holes and you can often see it in manuscripts. Sometimes scribes would [even write around the stitching or existing hole.](http://library.osu.edu/blogs/rarebooks/files/2008/12/gui_mss-hole.jpg). [Here's one where the stitching has fallen out or disintegrated over the years](http://library.osu.edu/blogs/rarebooks/files/2008/12/gui_mss-hole.jpg).


This is an old binding, but not original. The main reason I can tell is that your text block has been trimmed. If you look on your first illumination page, you can see where the top is cut off. I would also say that this might only be part of the original book. 120 pages seems quite short for an Antiphoner of that size. I wouldn't be able to tell for sure though without examining it more closely and whipping out some collational formulas. Don't worry, this is very, very common with old codices. If I were to guess at this point on the binding without examining it, I would say that it probably 16th-17th century. 

Lastly, for the time being, I don't know who your friend talked to, but this is worth far more than a few hundred. Just the fact that you have (at least) a partial codex it's worth much more than that. It's frankly, not in *great* physical condition, but I've certainly seen worse. Unless the dealer thought it was fake, I see absolutely no reason why he would quote them such a low price. And to my eye, it looks genuine.

 




 It was a hell of a play!  




 OH AND CHAMPAGNE. You can get champagne. Chicks dig it when you give them champagne.  




 Also, pro tip, bring some cash to get chocolate from Divine's at the intermission. Most things are only a few bucks - a wide selection from chocolate covered pretzel rods (white, milk, dark) to fancy shmancy truffles.
