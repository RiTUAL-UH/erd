 How are they so satisfying?! I'm mesmerised.  




 I thought they were protecting one another from each other by handing in the guns inside the walls.  




 I had never seen a stair lift in action, I am unbelievably satisfied.  




 Ah yes I guess. I presumed they'd just taken the knives from the kitchen in their houses. 

Seems ironic they made them give up their guns when a large majority of their kills are from knives or other random objects.  




 Can someone please tell me, why didn't Daryl have to turn in his crossbow? 




 Did you speak to her after that?
