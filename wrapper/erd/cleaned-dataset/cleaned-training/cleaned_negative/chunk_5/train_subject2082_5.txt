 * 30s: M (1931)       
* 40s: Banshun (1949)       
* 50s: Hiroshima mon amour (1959)       
* 60s: Andrey Rublyov (1966)      
* 70s: Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)      
* 80s: Der siebente Kontinent	 (1989)         
* 90s: Stntang (1994)     
* 00s: The Limits of Control (2009)    
* 10s: Norte, hangganan ng kasaysayan (2013)       




 You got some general and some specific recommendations already, here's some that I would add:     

* 8 (1963)      
* Accattone (1961)       
* I fidanzati (1963)     
* I pugni in tasca (1965)       
* Il deserto rosso (1964)      
* Il posto (1961)       
* Il vangelo secondo Matteo (1964)       
* L'eclisse (1962)      
* La notte (1961)       
* L'avventura (1960)     
* Mamma Roma (1962)   
* Viaggio in Italia (1954)       

Antonioni's alienation trilogy is truly amazing, I would say that especially L'eclisse (1962) is one of the best films ever made. 




 Someone else already mentioned Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969) by Yoshishige Yoshida, that's what I would say too. It's just sad how ignored Yoshida really is when it comes to cinema in general, many of his films are really amazing. I would love to see this one on Blu-ray. 




 Bringing up Baby (1938) and The Big Sleep (1946). 




 It's just pure aesthetic perfection, especially the framing is amazing. One of the best movies of all time too. It's also a tragedy that not a single Yoshida movie is out on Blu-ray, especially this one. 




 Examples of some gorgeous films:       

* 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)       
* Andrey Rublyov (1966)        
* C'era una volta il West (1968)    
* Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969)     
* L'eclisse (1962)        
* Mujo (1970)      
* Stntang (1994)        
* Stalker (1979)         
* Tobenai chinmoku (1966)     
* Zerkalo (1975)       

The bell scene in Andrey Rublyov (1966), the final duel in C'era una volta il West (1968), the hair washing scene in Zerkalo (1975) etc. There's so much stuff that's amazing. 




 You can use http://www.imdb.com/search/title to search for films with specific titles. 




 I think it's you. But to each his own. 









 I would suggest starting with Ivanovo detsvo (1962) and going on from there. It's a bit more accessible than his later works and a perfect start. Great movie too. 




 Thanks a lot for this! Now I'm waiting for The Freshman (1925), Riot in Cell Block 11 (1954) and The Complete Jacques Tati to pop up in the mail. The shipping gets quite high, especially if it's going to be delivered to Europe, but as you said, it's still a good deal. And by the way, I don't know if any of you got it too, but The Complete Jacques Tati on Blu-ray just went for CDN$ 10.39 also. 




 Great to see Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975) on the first place, that's what I would put there too. I was just waiting for it to show up when scrolling down! Some other great choices that are top favourites from 1975 for me as well. Thumbs up for choosing films by Angelopoulos and Fassbinder too. 









  I'm not sure it would count though - when the film begins, he's already tied in a mobius strip isn't he? You can hear the sirens blaring past with the "dick laurent is dead" on the intercom (I know, I'm being picky here).      

It was a long time ago when I saw it, but I checked a bit, and it starts with Fred Madison receiving that message on the intercom, but he isn't tied or anything, he's in his house. So yeah, it all depends on how you want to count it. The events sure are mysterious though. 




 You are welcome, it's a great movie! Have you seen Lost Highway (1997) by David Lynch too? If not, that would also fit the bill. Werckmeister harmnik (2000) by Bla Tarr is another recommendation. 




 How about Blue Velvet (1986)? 




 It's about eight interwoven stories, which occur in the lead-up to the 2001 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, it's just set on the other side of the Atlantic, that's where Denmark gets in the picture. 









 Stntang (1994). If you mean by year. 




 That's Hollywood in a nutshell. Money, money, money. What were you expecting? 




 Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975) by Chantal Akerman. 




 It sounds a bit like Wandfuru raifu (1998), could that be it? 




 The Act of Killing (2012). Make sure to watch the longer version. 




 * Delphine Seyrig in Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)         
* Gena Rowlands in A Woman Under the Influence (1974)      
* Margit Carstensen in Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972) 




 I waited some time with Stntang (1994) (~7 hours), Shoah (1985) (~9 hours) and Out 1, noli me tangere (1971) (~12 hours), but I finally saw them. Well worth the time, all three movies. For me it's mostly been about being in the right mood, not having the time was never really a problem. 




 Krhozat (1988). 




 It could be a progressive and very interesting thing if it's done in a great way, but I don't think we can expect somethng like that from a company like Marvel. Just look at their gender roles and how women are portrayed for example. 




 When I first heard about Jurassic World (2015), my expectations were very low. When I saw the trailer, nothing really changed, it just confirmed my feelings. I try to not have too high expectations overall when it comes to movies, but they are mostly at their lowest when we're talking about these kind of big mainstream films from Hollywood. At this point, you typically know what to expect from them. I don't associate modern day mainstream Hollywood with cinematic masterpieces exactly. 




 The Wicker Man (1973) is a must watch, not a bad one at all. 




 I have to say Stntang (1994). I really enjoyed the movie pretty much more than the book. 









 Interesting reading. And interesting to hear about the parts that Satyajit Ray helped with. I have to get my hands on this one. 




 Doesn't get better than these:      

* La jete (1962)      
* Pisma myortvogo cheloveka (1986)      
* Stalker (1979)           




 I posted this list in a similar thread in another subreddit. Here's 20 of my favourite movies that are 90 minutes or under that I would consider the best:          

* Csillagosok, katonk (1967) (90 minutes)         
* Gion bayashi (1953) (85 minutes)              
* Hiroshima mon amour (1959) (90 minutes)                
* I fidanzati (1963) (77 minutes)             
* Koridorius (1995) (85 minutes)            
* La jete (1962) (28 minutes)            
* Le rvlateur (1968) (67 minutes)                          
* Les yeux sans visage (1960) (88 minutes)                   
* Mouchette (1967) (78 minutes)              
* Nattvardsgsterna (1963) (81 minutes)         
* Nun va Goldoon (1996) (78 minutes)            
* Obrazy starho sveta (1972) (70 minutes)                             
* Okasareta hakui (1967) (56 minutes)            
* Persona (1966) (85 minutes)            
* Pickpocket (1959) (75 minutes)            
* Procs de Jeanne d'Arc (1962) (65 minutes)             
* Sayat Nova (1969) (79 minutes)             
* Shinjuku maddo (1970) (65 minutes)            
* Un homme qui dort (1974) (77 minutes)       
* Une femme est une femme (1965) (85 minutes)          




 L'eclisse (1962). No other movie does it better. 




 La jete (1962) is easily the best. 




 Rainer Werner Fassbinder in Faustrecht der Freiheit (1975) where he plays the main role. What a guy. 




 I wasn't surprised the first time I read about it either. A good one! Haneke has great taste. 














 Double Indemnity (1944). 




 Yeah, me too. But I'm glad that he at least is going to make another movie. 









 Du rififi chez les hommes (1955). 




 Kuroi ame (1989). 




 It's great. Well shot, great actors and a surreal and dark plot. One of David Lynch's best films. 




 Der siebente Kontinent (1989). 




 Here's ten great movies that I feel most people really have missed:      

* Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969)       
* Himiko (1974)  
* Le rvlateur (1968)            
* Mujo (1970)       
* Obrazy starho sveta (1972)   
* Onna no naka ni iru tanin (1966)   
* Shura (1971)          
* Tabiate bijan (1974)        
* Tobenai chinmoku (1966)       
* Tsuit no zawameki (1988)       

All of them are really good and deserve more attention. It's for example a bit sad that a great director like Yoshishige Yoshida is so unknown. It's even more heartbreaking that some of the movies I mentioned still haven't got any proper releases, I hope that will change in the future. 




 Too hard for me to make a top ten, but I know at least I would put these on my list:            

* 8 (1963)      
* Kokuhakuteki joyron (1971)        
* Le mpris (1963)      
* Nema-ye Nazdik (1990)    
* Nun va Goldoon (1996)              
* To vlemma tou Odyssea (1995)       




 A few of my favourite silents aren't on the list either, like Umirayushchii lebed (1917), Krkarlen (1921), Hxan (1922), Die Nibelungen: Siegfried (1924), Coeur fidle (1923), The Merry Widow (1925), Tretya meshchanskaya (1927), L'argent (1928), Frau im Mond (1929), City Girl (1930), Zemlya (1930), and  propos de Nice (1930). I saw other movies by Victor Sjstrm, Yevgeni Bauer, Erich von Stroheim and Jean Epstein on the list though. 




 I've seen 69 of them, a lot of shorts that I haven't taken the time to watch. Some interesting choices overall. Some of my favourite silents are present, so that was nice to see. This makes me eager to make a list of my own and also watch some of those that I haven't seen yet. 




 1. Der siebente Kontinent (1989)     
2. Andrey Rublyov (1966)     
3. L'eclisse (1962) 




 Il sorpasso (1962) and Saraba natsu no hikari (1968). 




 Krhozat (1988) by Bla Tarr. Also, do not miss out on Juhy no yoromeki (1968) by Yoshishige Yoshida that someone else already mentioned. 














 8 (1963). 




 Aruitemo aruitemo (2008). 




 Nattvardsgsterna (1963). 




 Sanma no aji (1962). 




 Andrei Tarkovsky. 




 No, how much money a movie makes has nothing to do with how good it is. 




 It always depends on what you mean with minimalism. But in general terms, nobody did minimalism like Robert Bresson, especially his later films. For example, look at Pickpocket (1959). But first, read about his rules and the way he made his films, it's very interesting and a must if you aren't familiar with his style. He stripped away every bare essential as much as he could, from the acting to the sound. I believe he was the true minimalist. 




 Tobenai chinmoku (1966) by Kazuo Kuroki. 




 Double Indemnity (1944) is really his best one in my opinion. One of the best movies when it comes to film noir and even American cinema in general. He's done some other good movies too (and some weaker ones), but I wouldn't call him that obscure as you seem to. Maybe he's not that discussed on a place like this, especially if you compare him to names like Kubrick, Hitchcock and Scorsese, but I feel that there's also some other great filmmakers that get mentioned even less (or possibly not at all). I guess it always depends on what and how you are comparing everything. 




 This month. 




 Post Tenebras Lux (2012)? 




 Tonari no Totoro (1988). It's cute, quick-witted, heartwarming, charming, has a magical atmosphere and looks stunning. It doesn't really rely heavily on conflicts either, which I think makes it even better. 




 Suna no onna (1964) and Spalovac mrtvol (1969). 




 I think it could be interesting. There's several other Mexican movies than the ones he was in I rather see getting the Criterion treatment, but on the other hand, I'd welcome some Cantinflas movies more than some other stuff. Also, more Mexican cinema in the collection would probably be a good choice. 




 Repulsion (1965). 




 La plante sauvage (1973) is probably the best one I've seen. 




 I don't have any specific parameters that I look for. But for a biopic to be really great, it has to be special. And in what way, that's something I wouldn't really know until I've seen it. For me, the form and how a biopic is done, that's for example far more important than if it covers a certain period of a subject's life or an entire existence.

My three favourite biopics that I feel are far superior than others:       

* Andrey Rublyov (1966)   
* Edvard Munch (1974)   
* Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969)   

What makes these three superior is their form and content and how they relate to each other. Tarkovsky's way of working and sculpting in time together with his philosophical and metaphysical depth, the interesting documentary approach Watkins uses, to Yoshida's interwoven and absurdly complex narrative which binds together time and subjects. 




 Director:        

* Michael Haneke      


Actors:       

* Isabelle Huppert       
* Isaach De Bankol       
* Kati Outinen      
* Taraneh Alidoosti         




 The Shining (1980) by Stanley Kubrick. 




 Woody Allen. 




 You should check out some classic film noir set in Los Angeles:       

* Double Indemnity (1944)       
* Kiss Me Deadly (1955)        
* The Big Heat (1953)      
* The Big Sleep (1945)     

L.A. Noire took quite many influences from these kind of movies, as you probably know, several titles can be found when looking for the golden film reels. I would also recommend Chinatown (1974) if you want something newer. It is set in 1937, but maybe that's good enough too. That movie is very similar to L.A. Noire. 




 Andrey Rublyov (1966). 




 Sanbiki no samurai (1964) by Hideo Gosha and Genroku Chshingura (1941) by Kenji Mizoguchi. 




 It's really enjoyable and entertaining. One of the best silent movies. If you will be bored? That's a strange question to ask, how should other people know that? On the other hand, it's a must watch if you have the slightest interest in cinema. The movie is a milestone when it comes to science fiction films, especially when it comes to the ones depicting a dystopia. Just the amazing sets makes it worth to see. It's as relevant today as it was back then, maybe even more now. 




 The Straight Story (1999). 




 Book chon bang hyang (2011). Hong Sang-soo's movies are really good. 




 Exactly! 




 Run times are quite secondary. One of the best films I have seen was over 7 hours long, another one was only 75 minutes, so it's quite irrelevant for me. The run time of a movie has nothing to do with the quality of it, there's so many other factors to the whole picture. Everything depends on how the movie is done, not how long the run time is. Shorter movies can sometimes even feel longer than the longer ones etc. Run times have never been a problem for me though. 




 I would put Amour (2012) and Ni na bian ji dian (2011) as the top ones in my list. By the way, the 2000s and the 21st century isn't the same thing, just a heads up. 









 My favourite is Sanma no aji (1962). 




 Chish Ry. 




 Conte d'automne (1998). The majority of Rohmer's films have great, realistic, smart and enjoyable dialogue. 




 Some kind of supernatural entity. Also, the director Mitchell said the following:             


*"I'm not personally that interested in where 'it' comes from. To me, it's dream logic in the sense that they're in a nightmare, and when you're in a nightmare there's no solving the nightmare. Even if you try to solve it."* 














 Three good movies about filmmakers:     
 
* 8 (1963)    
* Stardust Memories (1980)       
* To vlemma tou Odyssea (1995)       


Three good movies about painters:     

* Andrey Rublyov (1966)       
* Edvard Munch (1974)      
* La belle noiseuse (1991)      




 Gamlet (1964). 




 It does! 




 Trois couleurs: Bleu (1993) by Krzysztof Kieslowski. About a woman (played by Juliette Binoche) struggling to find a way to live her life after the death of her husband and daughter. 



















 Michael Haneke. 




 Le trou (1960). 




 That's the way life can be. 














 It's a bit hard to rank, but I would at least put these five in the top:       

* A torini l (2011)       
* Amour (2012)       
* Book chon bang hyang (2011)      
* Norte, hangganan ng kasaysayan (2013)       
* The Act of Killing (2012)       

Is it for a specific reason that your list only contains movies in the English language? Do you have another list for the rest? Or why did you put emphasis on that part? I don't get it.          




 No. He doesn't even come close to masters like Mizoguchi, Bresson, Tarkovsky, Bergman etc. 




 No. The best movie I've seen is of course my favourite, Der siebente Kontinent (1989). 




 To take an example, 2004 isn't old. And I'm pretty sure the majority with the least interest in movies who hangs out here has seen or knows most of those in the list. Many of them are the most celebrated ones here on Reddit. 




 Not at all. 




 No, but by directors that actually can make something good. 














 Woody Allen. 









 What do you mean with playing it safe? I don't think the majority of critics are writing what the public wants to hear, I think most of them are honest. But then again, I'm no expert in how the majority of critics do their work. By the way, I rather feel that movie critics overall nowadays are even too generous, but that's me.        

Anyways, let's talk about the movie. I thought it was quite bad. I wrote something about it in a similar thread, so what I'm going to say is about the same I said before, but it's always interesting to talk about movies and share your own opinions. For a narrative film of this kind and for it to be an allegory of interest, the story was too simple sided and superficial. In the end, I couldn't care less about anything. The whole movie felt something like a promotional commercial for Die Antwoord, which was silly. And quite everything actually felt silly, stupid, hollow and over the top in a bad way. From the pathetic dialogue to the action and to how it was shot. It's hard to take it seriously, because it doesn't work as a comedy or any kind of critique of something either. It makes me wonder if Blomkamp offered someone from junior high to write him the dialogue.      




 Manhattan (1979). 




 Here's 20 of my favourites that are 90 minutes or under:     

* Csillagosok, katonk (1967) (90 minutes)

* Un homme qui dort (1974) (77 minutes)       
* Une femme est une femme (1965) (85 minutes)       




 If Studio Ghibli are going to continue, maybe they could do a good job with it. Or if they could team up with Apichatpong Weerasethakul as a director in some way. 




 I think I like Sang sattawat (2006) and Sud sanaeha (2002) the best, especially when they're at their most minimalistic state. He's indeed one of the most interesting directors working today. Really looking forward to his newest movie. 




 Jean-Pierre Laud did an amazing job in Les quatre cents coups (1959).
