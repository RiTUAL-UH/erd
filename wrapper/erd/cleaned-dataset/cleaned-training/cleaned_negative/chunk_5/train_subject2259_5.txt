 Hm, that's really interesting. The upper body strength makes sense, but I wouldn't expect the jalapeo thing.   




 It's all good! It's related to my question and it is still very interesting! 




 That actually really fascinating. Especially from a psychological standpoint. As a woman I think (especially about emotional things), we do the same thing in assuming the other woman knows the feeling we are talking about. Thank you for sharing that!  




 I assumed it wouldn't be the exact same, but I've always been very curious about transgendered people and this shed a lot of light. You don't meet many here in the Deep South, if you remember the subs let me know!
