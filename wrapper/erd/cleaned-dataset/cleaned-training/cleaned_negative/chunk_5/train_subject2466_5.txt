 I hear you...I'm graduating in may and college didn't seem like my cup of tea (at least not right now).  Travel sounded good but I knew I'de never actually go anywhere on my own.  So I joined the Navy...now I have to go places. 




 Thanks!...I think...skatest?? 




 August 26th 2014 - EA (Engineering Aid) 




 I was sworn into the Navy and am on track to be an Engineering Aid.  My main concern is if I'm going to be able to keep up with the course work at my A school with no background knowledge.
