 Yes we did, we placed everything back after.  I don't always do set up shots this elaborate, I normally just shoot as I find it, but sometimes it's good to a have a little bit of fun!! 




 Hi, I don't batch edit, I do one pic at a time. I will eventually post more from this place 




 Set of three fun themed shots here

 lolol 




 No - I post a picture a day, from a variety of locations.  They might be from the same place a few days in a row, or they may not.

My only error here is adding links in my descriptors. 




 seems 128 upvoters don't seem to mind that I happen to have a link in my post on imgur.

regardless, I won't add that link in future posts. 




 me to, lots of emotions and thoughts when exploring! 




 I'm not in it for the stuff, I have seen some incredibly valuable stuff in these places and it has taken some serious will power to not take some of it! 




 you reddit people sure are miserable crusty mother fuckers 




 Lady died earlier this year. Looked like the family took what they wanted and left the rest behind and the house is in an area of future development so will likely be demo'd 




 stay tuned :)

 wrong 




 Thank You 


































 what does that even mean??  sorry I don't speak reddit 





























 look for a building
go to the top
push door
 - if locked, leave and find another one
 - if not locked - go outside!!!

Rule - don't fall!! 




 Me...if it's locked, I go and find another building 




 Some are locked, some are not - it's hit and miss 




 It's hit and miss, many buildings have locked roof access, some don't however, most hate two or more stairwells so if the first one doesn't provide access - try the next one. 




 good eye! 




 Do you say that every time you see someone take a photo of a bird, or flowers or nature? Do you say that when people take photos of children?

Give me a break,, its a genre just like those i mention above 




 lolol good one!!! 




 there it is!!!! 




 for the love of Pete! 


































 I wanna say you're wrong...

but you're not - you are right!!! 




 Thank You! 
























 You's a smart one Crazy Monkey!!!!!!
