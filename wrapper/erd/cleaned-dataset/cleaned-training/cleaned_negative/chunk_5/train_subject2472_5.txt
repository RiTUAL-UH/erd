 The reference that you cite is from the 14th paragraph of the article and is preceded by information obtained from other sources (2008 TED talk, 2011 documentary, etc.). Moreover, the reference does not meet the recency requirement that [the research linked to should be within the past 6 months (or so)](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/wiki/rules#wiki_submission_rules). I could not find any reference in the article that was more recent than 2013.
