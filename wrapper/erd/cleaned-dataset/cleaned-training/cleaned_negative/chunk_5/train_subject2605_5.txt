 ...well played. 



















 Great, thanks. I'll post this in the Atlanta and dragoncon subreddits this evening. 




 I'm sure there is, but I haven't looked.  









 I work with your brother at Jimmy John's. Small world. 




 Right on. Will do. 




 Sweet! I'll start a thread on r/Atlanta this weekend once I figure out a good time and place. 




 I'm thinking about organizing a Reddit meet-up at D*Con this year. Would you be interested? 




 I was considering organizing a Reddit meet-up for Dragon*Con. Would you be down?

 Bahahaha
