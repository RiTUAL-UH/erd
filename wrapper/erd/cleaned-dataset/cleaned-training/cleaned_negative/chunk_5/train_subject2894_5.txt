 Oh good thing you've spotted a Wikipedia page about insects and plants we **literally have all over the country.**


*Thank god these little bugs aren't confined to a small island that has upcoming plans to be bombed on. That'd be stupid now wouldn't it? :) Wouldn't want these species to die out in one go now would we?*

 As if we aren't killing nature enough, nah lets just go drop some nukes here and there. Totally can't just use blanks now can we, nooo noo, that'd be common sense. 




 Causing a blackout...
