They were shown in [DJ Ravine's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrnKWBkAk4I) headphone review and are normally priced at $200. I already own pioneer hdj 500 headphones and I am happy with them. Is this deal too good to pass up? Or would it not be worth it, meaning should I just wait to upgrade headphones to something better like the Sennheiser hdj 25-II?

Tl;dr- Do I upgrade or keep my pioneer hdj 500s?

Edit: Ended up buying these before the price increase, burned them in for 12 hours overnight and I'm definitely happy. Not as bass heavy as the hdj 500, but a clear upgrade. More comfortable, better isolation, and better sound overall.
