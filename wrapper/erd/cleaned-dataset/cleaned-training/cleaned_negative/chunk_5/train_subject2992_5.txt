 Timesplitters 2 had an awesome soundtrack, but [this was the best.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O89jzT55ELs) 




 Pretty solid episode. Didn't really get boring, good/funny writing, introduced a new companion (I like that they're copying Amy and Rory with Clara and Danny), big advancement on the Promised Land mystery in the last scene. Best episode of the series so far.
