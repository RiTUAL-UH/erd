 All I'm wondering is if the songs imported from RS1 have the little DLC tag on them when browsing your library in RS2014. 









 Wow thanks! I was actually hoping for a song about a supermarket. 




 To a lesser extent, food related songs are welcome as well.

 Well, what now? :P 




 Good Eats! 




 So, I've been taking a karate class for seven years and just next week I'm getting the chance to be tested for brown belt.

I will be testing with at least one other person, possibly my sister. I've been thinking about quitting for a while because my sensi (teacher) doesn't seem to be taking this class as seriously as he used to. One reason I don't want to take the test is that I WILL get hurt somehow, it might be because of getting punched, being slashed with a knife, or I could be hit by pole, but every single person who has taken the test has been injured in one way or another.

On the same day as the test, The Monkees are starting off their reunion tour, and It would be an amazing experience. The venue where they are playing is only forty-five minutes away from where I live, but where they are going to be playing after that is about seven hours away, in New Jersey.
