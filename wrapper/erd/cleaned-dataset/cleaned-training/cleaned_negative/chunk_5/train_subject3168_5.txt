 yup, here it is, my ~/.i3/config:

 no, that didn't work...same behavior. 




 Okay, so I've been using i3 for a while and love it, but I have one issue I still have yet to resolve that bothers me.  I use 9 workspaces and they are usually all filled with something, be it terminals or a web browser or whatever.  

If I am on one workspace, say workspace #3, and I want to move a window from it to workspace #5 (there are already things on workspace #5) then mod + Shift + 5 on the selected window creates a NEW #5 workspace instead of putting it on the existing 5th workspace, so now I have 2 "#5" workspaces.  Ideally I would like it to move the window to the existing workspace #5.  Any ideas as to how to accomplish this?  Thanks.

 I'm having the exact same issue.  I keep getting Error 118.  Total store, community, groups, etc lockout.
 




 Keep strong...it will pass.
