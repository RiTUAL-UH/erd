 My Son, do *not* disrespect my Daughters. I will not tolerate Them being referred to as "ass." 




 I don't care. 




 Good. I was hoping you wouldn't.

 that's such a Samantha thing to say 




 that's more than I weigh 




 cheese, bacon and hot dogs. alright. I guess some people get excited really easily.  




 I'm a year and four months sober from carbs.   




 I'm 18 years old and have a *perfect* body!!!!!!!! 

...

but it's like whateva 




 finally someone gets it 




 Yeah, I figured... 




 lolwhut 




 listen to the album "Adore" 




 Yes, move. 




 Also I keep listening to the album "Adore" by Smashing Pumpkins. I can't stop listening to it. Something about Billy Corgan's voice, I guess. I try to sing along.

I also cannot stop jerking off. I usually only masturbate every few days, but now whenever I am fucking reminded that the female gender exists, so much blood flows into my dick that it fucking hurts. 




 Nope. No taper.  




 around half a year 




 I was on 14 mg of Ativan a day, and my psychiatrist decided to take me completely off of it. I haven't been able to sleep for like a week... 




 just eat meat. only meat.  




 It's Magoo.

 Please don't respond if you aren't able to play it. We get it. I'm talking to the people who are able to play the game.

The story is pretty fucking weak, and Batman is *way* too reliant on the Batmobile. I could not stop rolling my eyes.

 hahahahahaha 




 Deficit of calories. 

This means "to eat less calories than you burn."

Large calorie deficit.

This means "to eat a lot less calories than you burn."

Answer: a little 




 "Will this make me wear carb goggles if my diet consisted exclusively of this?"

That is what you need to ask yourself. If the answer is yes, put the food down.  









 Harvey Dent. Can we trust him? 




 A block of cheese. Seriously you don't needs cake. [Billy Corgan knows.](http://vos.lavoz.com.ar/files/imagecache/lvivos_nota_652_366/nota_periodistica/13_Jun_2012_16_18_07_billy-corgan-2012.jpg) 




 How can I believe you? How do I know this won't make me wear carb goggles? 




 Stop referring to your awesome father as I have daddy issues. Thanks. [Billy Corgan is watching.](http://vos.lavoz.com.ar/files/imagecache/lvivos_nota_652_366/nota_periodistica/13_Jun_2012_16_18_07_billy-corgan-2012.jpg) 




 lmfao 




 Okay. Calories in, calories out. 

If you eat a calorie surplus due to this really cool cheese that I found at Trader Joes, you will gain just as much weight as with an identical calorie surplus caused by an episode of wearing carb goggles. The ketogenic diet is a good tool because being in ketosis induces a loss of appetite. It sounds like you're experiencing emotional eating, meaning you eat even when you are not hungry. You need to face your fears and grow some balls (wait you are female so that saying will not motivate you). Just track your macros. Fuck. Alright. I don't think my text will motivate you, so I will have to motivate you some other way. [Billy Corgan is watching you and judging you.](http://vos.lavoz.com.ar/files/imagecache/lvivos_nota_652_366/nota_periodistica/13_Jun_2012_16_18_07_billy-corgan-2012.jpg) If that doesn't motivate you, nothing will.  




 Motivation? All you need to know is that Billy Corgan [is always watching and judging your every behavior.](http://vos.lavoz.com.ar/files/imagecache/lvivos_nota_652_366/nota_periodistica/13_Jun_2012_16_18_07_billy-corgan-2012.jpg) That sure motivated me. 




 He is a famous poet. He learned that nobody really likes to read poetry anymore, so he decided to form this great band called the Smashing Pumpkins and release his poetry in the form of song.  




 He is always watching. 




 Cool. Seriously, you don't want to upset Billy. 




 okay I honestly don't know what the fuck you mean by "rev up ketosis." stop. eat less than 20 grams of carbs a day and be sure to eat in a large calorie deficit. [Billy Corgan *will* know if you don't. He is watching.](http://vos.lavoz.com.ar/files/imagecache/lvivos_nota_652_366/nota_periodistica/13_Jun_2012_16_18_07_billy-corgan-2012.jpg) 




 you're going to have to ride this out. [Billy Corgan is watching you.](http://vos.lavoz.com.ar/files/imagecache/lvivos_nota_652_366/nota_periodistica/13_Jun_2012_16_18_07_billy-corgan-2012.jpg) 




 ok this isn't going to work out if you set a diet "start date." just start it now or you're not going to get anywhere. that is step one.

also don't cheat your diet. [Billy Corgan will *not* put up with that shit.](http://vos.lavoz.com.ar/files/imagecache/lvivos_nota_652_366/nota_periodistica/13_Jun_2012_16_18_07_billy-corgan-2012.jpg) I have stayed sober from carbs since early Feburary of 2014. It takes a while to detox.

Calories are a *limit,* not a goal. If you're not hungry, don't eat. 

I have been diagnosed with anorexia and have struggled with bulimia (no formal diagnosis), so I know my shit.

 




 why put all this work into cooking when you can just eat meat and cheese. I just think of hunger as an annoying ex-girlfriend now 




 it's really hard to increase calories after you get used to a certain amount. I got diagnosed with anorexia even though I don't have body dysmorphia. I just procrastinated increasing calories. lol mental hospitals suck 




 are you srs 









 Probably The Brothers Karamazov cover as it says "The Brothers Karamazov" on it. 




 fucking lol 




 *Stop*! You're making Ish all *hot* and *bothered*!

 As it was Written

To displace our Fears

So something Begins

As it should have never started

It is poor

But it Speaks

To Begin

What never Was 




 No, I really am white. 




 I am in agreement, my Son.

"As a Man has Walked

He is Saved

In the Cave hidden by fog

So it has been

To bless

One who has been Forgotten"

 A party. Ah... Ha... Ah...

Well...

My Son is growing up. A Father always smiles when Blessed with this Treat. 

Have fun, and please do not impregnate any of my Daughters if you do not intend to support Them. 

"Imperitive, is it

To support one who is Weaker

As a Man has Fallen

From the Nest of an eagle

To forget

What is never remembered"

-unknown 




 Ah... Do not Tempt me, my Son. 




 I love watching my Sons and Daughters build up their physiques and compete against one another in the Garden. Magical. I recommend going on a ketogenic diet. This is what I do when I assume the form of Man. 




 I like Bioshock, too. 




 I know the feeling, my Son.

Haha, I remember when you took your first steps. These are the memories which bind Us. 




 What do you listen to when twerking out? I like to listen to Billy Corgan's sweet, sweet voice in my ears. 




 If you have to ask

You'll never know

Funky motherfuckers

Will not be told to go
 




 People always had the right to marry. 




 no, I don't do parties.  




 right now it's a nish nish for me, but it can turn to an ach yah if you lose some fat 




 approximately 74.21569 ounces 




 wait... is Jeff Seld back??????? fook yah!!!!! 




 Mads Magoo. 




 Bruno 




 cool 




 You realize that 90% of what I say is a joke, right? 




 you are going to get sooooooooo much karma 




 *Stop*! You're making Ish all *hot* and *bothered*! 




 I'm white. 




 good, you have been converted already.  




 do you want me to hold you 




 NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!

Seriously fuck this series. first they kill off my favorite comic book character, now they're going to harm my Barbs.  




 SCARECROW LEAVE HER ALONE! I WILL BREAK MY ONE RULE JUST FOR YOU, BUDDY! 




 please no spoilers, but i am at the part where Scarecrow threatens my Barbs. she is like a daughter to me. if she gets hurt, I'm fasting for at least a month. I'm not scared of being hospitalized for anorexia again.  




 well it didn't work. I just examined my balls, and guess what? 

THEY ARE INTACT

your tricks won't work on me, Two-Face. 




 I am really proud of The Witcher 3. I have the slipcover and everything, no big deal, no big deal. 




 there was no pm, sorceress. pls stahp being a meanie. i get intimidated easily. 




 alright. I like bodybuilding, but I don't jerk myself to this competitive shit  




 no i did *not,* you harlot. pics or negs. 




 oh fuck. no I don't mean it like that. you can't even if you wanted to, as I don't have a cunt. 

phrases sometimes have multiple meanings. For example, "look at that sick cunt" could mean "look at that ripped guy," "there is a really sick woman over there. she probably needs to get checked out. like at the hospital or something," or "take a look at that douche right there." 




 ok I got it. thanks for not being a jerk  




 so far my collection consists entirely of Xbox One games. I'm a really kool kat. 




 one of them is mulatto. one is really tan. one has tats, one doesn't have any visible. they are both like the same height. one really likes hats and has a wider smile. They both like tapered belts. 

this is really hard, so stop being a meanie. not everyone is super duper smart like you. so just tell me which is which please, as I am really lost. 




 that's cute 




 wait which one is which... I get confused really easily, so don't eat me out 




 [spoiler now] SCARECROW LEAVE BARBARA ALONE! She has does nothing to you! 

Please tell me Barbs is going to be safe. She's like a daughter to me. A really cute daughter.

 I'm an Adidas guy myself.

IF YOU WEAR NIKES I WILL FUCKING KILL YOU 




 God... fuck this "Magoo" guy... 

he is *so* yesterday 




 no that's a nish nish. im not bruno im straight dave 




 Please stop laughing. If Barbara hears you mocking her... she just might... ah... hurt herself. 




 Not funny. Depression is serious. Barbara needs to be protected from herself. 




 oh my god, we get it.  




 Yeah it's really fucking annoying how it's fucking impossible for Batman to complete a mission without the fucking batmobile. All of a sudden he is completely reliant on the batmobile when in the previous three games he didn't need it at all... 




 I mean, she really needs to be put on suicide watch. 




 wait you didn't put "no homo" after that. 

you're confusing me. 




 I mean it worked for me. I used to be obese, then I got hospitalized for anorexia at 106 lbs. Works like a charm. Now I'm not *that* underweight. 




 Zero calories. If you want diet soda, coffee, etc. that's alright. If you accidentally ingest calories, you gotta throw it up.  




 I totally agree with you, but worry about living a healthy lifestyle *after* you get to a healthy weight. For now, you need to forget all that and fast whilst doing all the cardio you can. 




 obvious shitpost is obvious. even the "Magoo" fuckface isn't this bad 




 you're over 40% body fat, so it's time to start fasting until you're at a healthy weight. sorry, but you can't worry about muscle if you're obese. this is a crisis. 




 is it over 9,000 




 oh I'm sorry I'll shorten it. it'll just take a sec. hold on babe 




 to get bitches. 

so far I have collected 9 female pugs. lifting is really working out for me 




 NO! 




 lolwhut 




 Saying Magoo is annoying is a nish nish all the way. 




 http://www.iphotoscrap.com/Image/769/1297087699.jpg 




 Not being up to date is a *definite* nish nish. 




 ok I'm confused 




 No. I swallow.  




 wtf? I'm not some $2 hooker. lol 









 ALMOST small... I wear an XS. HA! 




 TWO DIFFERENT WORLDS... inside the same... world...

whoa 
 




 Okay, I laughed. But I'm a guy, so making me laugh won't get you any poon.
