 I know right?!  I'll keep my future kids away from the Ram Van. Back in my days we used to download RAM for FREE! 




 The candyman is safe. Kids these days need to stay away from the Ram Van. In my day we used to download free ram.  




 I do not understand why sliding down an escalator will make you multiply. There is no woman in the picture...

 Mad of now there is no option for that. :( 




 I did address the comparability improvements. I just wish I could kinda put a skin on that:( 




 So 7 hours ago FL12 was released. I, like probably everyone else here, immediately downloaded and installed it. Unlike the most of you I did not try the beta though, for I was waiting for a stable version. Only after I had installed FL it loaded with a flat yet childish UI that I personally do not favor over FL11's. The font is a impact roundish font that is rather large at times and does not blend with the interface. FL12 looks like a toy to me. I prefer FL11's professional looks.
KUDOS TO ImageLine for adding touchpad usability. Now I can work on the go. Rarely do, but thanks.  




 Thanks. Just got them new. Usually never wore my old ones. 




 So as a 16 year old teen with rather large ears and glasses my helix tore. I LISTENED TO MUSIC SO LONG THAT MY HELIX TORE! It happened because my headphones pushed my glasses to rub and pierce the skin on my ear...that's my best audiophile story. I want to know what you guys have done concerning music.
