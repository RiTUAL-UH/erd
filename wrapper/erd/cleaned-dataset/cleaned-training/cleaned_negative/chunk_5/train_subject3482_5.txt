 I realized when I was in third grade and my mom couldn't help with my math homework that not all adults were smarter than me, just older and taller. 




 THis is a good question for /r/AskScience. 




 Honda Civic 




 That people only care about what they can get from you.


 




 I think they'll wait for the UN report.  At least, I hope they do. 




 I think we should stay out and let them settle their own wars. 




 Pepper Jack 




 George W. Bush and his political cronies are responsible for the deaths of over a million Iraqui people and a large number of soldier suicides.  He comes in first place, so far. 




 It's reasonable for them to leave and it's reasonable for the smoker to make their own decisions and not be told what to do.  What is not reasonable to issue threats to a loved one. 




 You should check out /r/RoomPorn and some of the affiliated subreddits.  You might get some good ideas there. 




 Pregnancy. 




 I've never run into anyone who thought someone else was a demon, let alone call them one.  How offensive were you to them, exactly? 




 That Papua New Guinea's 'Black Jesus', convicted rapist Steven Tari, was hacked to death. 




 I don't believe they've presented any evidence, only their word on it.

CNN article on it here: http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/17/opinion/bergen-nsa-spying

"On Thursday, Sens. Ron Wyden and Mark Udall, Democrats who both serve on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and have access to the nation's most sensitive secrets, released a statement contradicting this assertion. "Gen. Alexander's testimony yesterday suggested that the NSA's bulk phone records collection program helped thwart 'dozens' of terrorist attacks, but all of the plots that he mentioned appear to have been identified using other collection methods," the two senators said.

Indeed, a survey of court documents and media accounts of all the jihadist terrorist plots in the United States since 9/11 by the New America Foundation shows that traditional law enforcement methods have overwhelmingly played the most significant role in foiling terrorist attacks." 




 Mine would be 0.  She's a nice lady who works harder than I do.  I like her. 




 Being as active and mobile as I am now.  I will not be in 20 years. 




 I don't agree.  Fox is decidedly conservative while NBC is decidedly liberal.  Guests who appear on those channels or news sites are quickly shot down or bullied due to their opposing positions.  Each one caters to a particular mind set, as do the others.  They can say they're unbiased all they want but it doesn't make it true. 




 "I just really want an unbiased answer based on facts instead of opinions."  Yeah, don't we all. 




 Fox News and NBC aren't any different from any other major news site, they just happen to be of a particular point of view opposite to each other.  They're all large corporations going for the money, they all know what sells and they go after it.  There are no completely unbiased news sites and those are as valid as any other.  You have to read both sides to get an idea of the truth. 




 The only reason I know of to be intentionally fired is to get unemployment. 




 When it's upvoted it gains a point.  When it's downvoted it loses a point.

 No.  Anyone can type /user/username and see your comments. 




 There's no way to know this since war casualties are estimates, and the numbers saved couldn't possibly be ascertained or accurate. 




 It's bad because this isn't a free advertising website.  If you want to promote yourself you need to pay them for the space.  Otherwise, everybody and his brother would be doing it and reddit would eventually become nothing but an online business listing website.   




 Buy some paint brushes and hand them over to a bunch of kids with the instruction to make it the Ugliest Truck In The County.  Take pics for prosperity. 




 Tissues.  I've never had to use them but I have them ready just in case I do. 




 I've never lost my faith in humanity. 




 Find a good lawyer to represent me when I was sued in court for theft. 




 I'd go to work like every other day.  I have no say-so in world affairs. 




 That if I pulled my dad's finger I'd grow big and tall.  I pulled that finger countless times. 




 What are you talking about? Black people use the word all the time.  It is not up to me or you to determine if that's offensive to God or if it isn't, or, if that is considered taking the Lord's name in vain since "God" isn't His name.  You should stop and let God do the judging.  You can't put your personal morality on other people.  Do what's right for you and let God take care of the rest.  Will saying the word "fuck" keep me out of heaven, too? 




 I find it offensive too, but it's their right to say any word they want to.  Make your preference known to the people doing it and then leave it alone.  They're adults with the right to free speech, just like you are.  Remember, you aren't their judge or jury. 




 At the beach. 




 Leaving the house soon after breakfast and not coming home until lunchtime.  Leaving after lunch and not coming home until dinner time. 




 It should not occur at this time.  The US needs to wait for the UN inspector's report and not go in at all without the full support of the UN. 




 You probably have worms. 




 The Powerball lottery. 




 Google how many psychics have been wrong in their predictions.  Then show her this one:

 Unlikely, since we'd all have to fight for the basics to survive.  I'd get what I needed to live, one way or another. 




 Baking soda. 




 Try /r/History. 




 The first moon landing. 




 Community College for the first two years then transfer to University.  Helps keep the costs down. 




 I'm never going to be younger than I am right now. 




 I'll pay less per year if I opt out and just pay the penalty.  I'm paying for insurance now that I don't need, so I might as well pay less for nothing.  If I should need it, it'll be there. 




 A good question for /r/TrueAskReddit. 




 People come into your life and people go out.  Just understand that you don't get to keep them, so be happy for whatever time you had together. 




 It's been there as long as I can remember. 




 Who's the one determining your death date?  I don't know where to go with this without knowing how it was determined. 




 Drugging people without their consent is against the law.  I'll relax when *I* want to relax, not when someone forces it on me in the face of sudden death.  This is not a good idea, in my opinion. 




 I think all their hard work and effort in anything else gets thrown out the door the instant they portray themselves as slutty women.  Got a PhD? No matter, show me that ass. 




 14 year olds who think they're experts on foreign policy, and  any other subject that comes up. 




 When one states they want to make an introduction people assume they're new.  Since you aren't, ask whatever you want to. 




 There isn't a subreddit for introductions, but you could start one.  This is a subreddit for asking questions. 




 Pusillanimous

 Since when has the will of the people made any difference, or even been considered, in war plans and strategies? 




 Nope, not me, sorry.  I can't tell you that. 




 I'd buy a new chair I've been looking at for two weeks. 




 Assad is not a stupid man.  This is part of the plan and he's the sacrificial lamb.  Defense secretaries seem to have a penchant for war and declaring things with no proof but a few internet supplied videos. 




 Knowing that it would be my last life before going to Heaven.  At least I'd know I had made progress. 




 A good question for /r/TrueAskReddit. 




 Cauliflower and collards sauteed in foie gras sprinkled with stinky cheese and served over tongue. 




 Everyone should have and display good ethical behaviour, no matter what job they have or don't have.  Right and wrong conduct shouldn't be an option in society, but that's why we have laws. 




 You lack critical thinking skills and can't see what's in front of your face either, apparently. 




 Yes, *really*.  You'll find out one day. 




 God has seven eyes that go to and from over the Earth.  Zechariah 4:10 




 He's omniscient, He sees it and doesn't forget any of it.   




 Because the US wants a good reason to sell invasion and war to the country. 




 New York City 




 I like the view and I'm in no hurry. 




 Yes, twice.  Scariest thing that's ever happened to me.  I thought I was having a heart attack.  Overwhelming sense of dread. 




 There used to be one called /r/hiddenrooms, but it's dead now, it seems.  I'd try /r/secretpassages for a start, although there isn't activity there either.  Perhaps you could message one of the mods from those subreddits for an updated place. 




 I'd explain the situation to the customer and why I can't take any action at this time, take down all pertinent information so that I could get on it first thing Monday morning. Then I'd follow through on my word on Monday. 




 I'm against killing any animal for reasons other than consumption.  If you're going to eat it then it's ok to use the skin. 




 You should have asked him to elaborate on that.  That's going to happen no matter a person's age.  I get that crap from 12 year olds.  Everybody's an expert when you disagree with them. 




 No one cares about your jeans or your shoes.  Stop posting this crap before you're reported. 




 Print out a note and tape it on the building where they're sure to see it.  Tell them they've been observed participating in illegal activities and if they're seen there again the police will be notified.  You aren't going to stop them no matter what you do, so you might was well warn them to move along. 




 The majority of Americans don't trust or support them any more than you do.  I wouldn't be surprised if they reach the point of saturation sooner than the government expects. 




 As long as they don't work together directly and one isn't the others' superior I don't see a problem with it. 




 I think you've figured out that American citizens are not the government.  Nowadays, they do things without securing proper approval or the citizens' support first.  The majority do not support any intervention in Syria and want more attention paid to domestic issues. 




 Ferlin Huskey, Mel Tillis, Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Conway Twitty,  Tammy Wynette, Hank Williams, Ray Price, Johnny Cash and all those people famous in country music back then.

Here's one of his favorites, [Jim Reeves - He'll Have To Go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpi8Bek6jdM) 




 I don't believe it's your business, either, despite your finger-shaking. 




 Because it's common courtesy to be respectful to others and some people are more vocal about that expectation.  Those people have lived through far more than you have and have more knowledge and wisdom in things you don't know about yet. 




 You want hope that things will change just like the rest of us.  I'm afraid that isn't going to happen no matter how much we want it to or spout off on websites.  Climate change is the least of your worries, or should be.  There are far greater evils at work right now over which we have no control. 




 How old are you?  Are you living at home with parents? 




 I think they want Assad out one way or another.  If a "threat" to get that ball rolling is required, then a "threat"  is what they will have. 




 Education, experience and sometimes Google.  Everything's a resource. 




 DrudgeReport.com 




 Of course they can.  You don't have to be in every situation but you can certainly have an informed opinion on it. 




 [Etch-A-Sketch](http://www.itstrulyrandom.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/monalisaetchascketch.jpg) would sidetrack him and ruin his future.

 I'd leave the site.  I don't do facebook and I wouldn't do reddit.  There are scary people in this world and I don't want them at my house. 




 We aren't murderers here.  Go to a prison and ask one. 




 They've invited the UN to come in for inspections. There's more than meets the eye on this, so be wary of headlines from biased MSM news sources.  I refer you to this thread:

 Android allows you to add the apps you want.  Check out Google Play or the Android Store. See if anything there will work for you.   It's much more customizable.  I know it has Microsoft Word. 




 Mousetrap with peanut butter or cheese should do the trick. 




 Get an Android tablet instead of those. 




 Avatar. 




 It'll stay with you for a while then go away while you're focused on other things.  It comes back from time to time, but by the time you're old and gray you'll have a better understanding of it and it won't worry you so much.  That's a very, very long time from now so, stop worrying and don't do anything you'll regret later. 




 No, just wrap me in linen and throw me in. 




 I've seen things...strange things.  But they were not ETs.
