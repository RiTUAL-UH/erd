 Wat mij betreft word alle drugs verboden of op speciale regeling met artsen die hiervoor geleerd hebben. Je vergeet nu wel dat Heroine dan ook legaal word en Cocaine, Speed en Crack.

Uiteraard mag een mens zelf bepalen wat je met je lichaam doet en het gebruiken is ook niet strafbaar. Er is geen wet dat je de bak in draait als je stijf staat van de speed. 

Je mag bepalen wat je neemt maar het is wel de taak van je medemens en overheid om je te beschermen. 




 zou in theorie toch kunnen? Als de VVD valt hebben ze daar toch beiden profijt van? 




 Ja maar internet is sowieso een moeilijk onderwerp, want als de politie nu een huiszoeking heeft bij jou thuis is eigenlijk hetzelfde. Vragen ze de code van je kluis heb je 2 keuzes of je geeft de code of ze maken hem zelf even open en dit is volkomen normaal vinden we. 

Persoonlijk vind ik dat ze een speciaal bewijs nodig hebben wat ongeveer gelijk staat aan een huiszoeking alleen dan voor je computer in dit geval vind ik dat je dan verplicht je encryptiesleutel moet geven wanneer ze het vragen. Maar vrijwillig zonder reden is niet de bedoeling. 

Niet zoals de NSA zomaar alles doen zonder toestemming en lak aan alles heeft.

De rechtsbijstand is toch wel een moeilijk onderwerp ben je onschuldig dan vind ik dat je niet hoeft te betalen voor de advocaat en juridische hulp, maar ben je schuldig vind ik dat je hier zelf voor mag betalen in plaats van de belastingbetaler. Het lijkt me het meest logisch dat ze hier op bezuinigen? Want is het nu niet zo dat schuldig of onschuldig je altijd een advocaat kan krijgen van de overheid? 




 Het was zeker geen cadeautje wat die vervolgens ook nog is benadrukte..

Natuurlijk moet er openheid van zaken zijn, maar vind het gewoon sneu voor die man dat die waarschijnlijk door dat bedrag meer criminelen heeft kunnen opsluiten en deze manier van handelen word vaak gebruikt:
http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma

De PVV en SP zaten al maanden te huilen dat het kabinet moest aftreden volgens mij is dit gewoon geregisseerd door hun.

Van die twee partijen ben ik alles behalve een fan.
 




 Dat ze het hoogste percentage hadden van de stemmers, vergeleken met de andere politieke partijen. Bedoelde ik. 




 Very informative, but damn he sprints thru those slides. 




 Het probleem is inderdaad gigantisch en kan no way gestopt worden dat begrijp ik wel. Maar er aan toe geven is ook niet de oplossing. Het is natuurlijk wel zo dat wanneer het op de vrije handel gebeurd we er tenminste nog wat aan verdienen.

Mijn enigste standpunt waarom het niet gelegaliseerd mag worden is de gezondheid, ook al heb je het in de puurste vorm het is nog steeds verschrikkelijk slecht voor je.

En het criminelen circuit zal uiteindelijk toch ook wel de vrije handel overnemen door de producenten te bedreigen/afpersen. 




 My Cortisol was way to low because of a Hypophysitis what was undiagnosed for along time but i was constantly saying i feel so sick to my doctors and they kept saying yeah it's anxiety and send me home every time so on a saturday I didn't knew my name anymore and I was so sick and so weak I told my dad bring me to a hospital where i have never been he brought me to university hospital and they diagnosed a Adrenal crisis.

Some info what it is:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenal_crisis

After some meds i'm doing much better now and the Hypophysitis  is all gone!
And medicine free now!


 




 I feel very sorry for you and on the other hand happy you are still a life, won't tell you hey just go to a nice island and enjoy because that's not what will make you happy at this stage. 
But be patience, trust the professionals who are going to help you and someday you are going to be happy. 

Stay strong!

edit: some grammar. 




 Dat het wereldwijd niet goed zit met de handel ben ik totaal met je eens.
Maar geregistreerd gebruik kan gewoon niet en vrij verkrijgbaar is toch eigenlijk super raar? Iets zwaardere pijnstiller dan paracetamol zijn niet verkrijgbaar zonder voorschrift maar vervolgens zou je wel cocaine vrij verkrijgbaar kunnen krijgen das toch verschrikkelijk krom? 

Persoonlijk denk ik dat de risico's veel duidelijker moeten worden gemaakt in plaats van legaliseren. 

Ze maken het echt niet illegaal om je te pesten.

 




 Hard drugs moet zeker niet legaal worden, gecontroleerd of ongecontroleerd. Stel we doen het gecontroleerd dan zou het moeten voorgeschreven worden dan door een Arts? Aangezien we zwaardere pijnstillers dan paracetamol al niet zelf mogen kopen?
Het legaal maken lijkt me echt niet de beste oplossing.

edit: comma
edit: illegaal moest legaal zijn. 




 Ja is toch bloed irritant, de meerderheid van het volk heeft gekozen voor 4 jaar VVD, ga dan niet na 2 jaar roepen jaa jullie moeten aftreden. Zo los je nooit wat op. 




 Die Spong vertelde dat er continu van dit soort deals worden gesloten. Kan me ook iets herinneren van school iets met prisoners dilemma.

 




 Mensen zullen altijd te hard rijden dus daarom het maar legaal maken? 




 Die beargumentatie slaat natuurlijk nergens op.  




 drugs legaal? Ben je niet goed? 




 Vind wel beetje vreemd dat ze hierdoor meoten afstappen terwijl er echt aan de lopende band word gelogen in de tweede kamer.

Die andere partijen proberen de vvd en pvda neer te harken zodat het kabinet valt want let maar op morgen is het gezeik net zo groot en zullen partijen opperen dat het kabinet moet vallen vanwege het achterhouden van informatie of iets dergelijks.

Overigens vond ik het voor Opstelten wel echt tijd worden hoe die soms communiceerde dat kon echt niet meer en aangezien de meeste criminaliteit via het internet plaats vind denk ik al helemaal niet dat hij de juist man was, volgens mij weet die niet eens hoe een telefoon werkt.

Volgens mij was die Teeven zo slecht nog niet.  




 Steve is on steroids. 




 This is exactly how I see it. Because a big amount of company's/starters forget the basics of there company and bump right in to the wall when they launch there product. 




 Off course you need a MVP but I would develop that, make a business plan and then go to the big investors, in some way you have to hand them some proof and you need to show you are well prepared and know where you are talking about.

The way the valley works is not really representative for the rest of the world and you forget that 80% of the startups don't make it or even a higher percentage. But we all know there are really brilliant products in the valley who simply don't make it because of lack of management and wrong planning.

My uncle and the fiance of my mother always said, you can seriously see in a business plan if a company is gonna make or break it and when something doesn't work in a business plan you can always rethink it.

I do like the idea a lot to get in front of your potential customer and get feedback. Although I would consider this as acquisition. This is also very important in your business plan. 




 You should treat him like every other employe how would function like this. 




 Following this subreddit for quiet a time now and I would like to contribute some of my knowledge gained by school (marketing student) or at the family dinner table (my moms father developed a certain machine in the agriculture where they are market leader world wide, and mom had a fiance who had leading retail store in my home country in his sector). Its not to brag and im not a specialist but I know a couple of things and would be happy to help out. Off course this isnt how you should do it but maybe you it will help you out a bit.

I get the feeling that allot of people just randomly think: Hey I can build a webshop so im gonna make one and gonna sell what I personally like or what I personally think people would like.. This is your absolute good right to do but the fact of the matter is a very few of this business last for a long time. If not done properly. 

Businesses or companys have to be focused on certain problems people are experiencing, or on a certain demand consumers have. This has to be based on facts! Not your own facts but true facts from different sources. I say this because allot of people will make up there own facts because they lose reality. Not that you are insane but you get lost in your own company pretty easy. But you have to remember almost nobody will have the drive and enthusiasm as you have, about your product. 
Do you always look at the ads on the internet page, click on them and buy something? If its your own ad it sounds very logical that somebody will click on it, but this isnt the case.

How to get the facts and figures?
a **BUSINESS** **PLAN** on paper or made in Words what every you want but it has to be readable for other people. I noticed that seriously a huge group didnt have one and a lot of companys don't make it because of wrong management and lack of structure. It doesnt matter how big or small your company is, you will always need a business plan! It will become something to fall back on especially in the beginning. It will also give you a clear view if you idea/company/business is really worth a try or if its better to find something else.

Where to get one?
There are seriously millions of concepts or samples on the internet they are all roughly the same and most of them will always have certain topics that will be discussed.
Here are some example sites:
http://www.bplans.com/sample_business_plans.php
http://www.myownbusiness.org/plans/
When you google business plan sample you will get loads of sites and samples.
At the bottom you will find 3 books that I find the most useful so far.

Why a business plan? 
It gives you a certain structure on how to work out your business and to target your audience. It will also help allot financially because you have a better idea how much money you will spend on advertising, employees and all other expenses and when you break even or when you will start to make profits. 

When you ask advice it is very hard to help you when you dont know your customers profile. Sure you want to sell to all people on this planet, everybody wants that, but that isnt realistic or you have HUGE amounts of advertising money, so especially in the beginning you need to narrow it done a lot:
Gender,
Age,
Country,
City,
Interest,
School,
Relation ship,
Hobbys,
and the list goes on and on and on.

When you have answers to all those demographics you will get a certain customer profile. With this customer profile it is way easier to find the right bloggers/websites/newspapers to work together with and to make a certain social media profile.

Try to narrow your customer profile to lets say your hometown, college, university, church this are just some examples but I think you will know what I mean with the size of your target group. When you reached all of your prospects or you reached your goals you move on to a bigger market so you can take away some of your demographics to grow and advertise bigger.

But by far the most important thing is to develop a strong and good business plan it sounds a little dull but it will teach you a great amount of marketing and in general about developing a business because you have to research a huge amount of information.
 
The business plan is very hard work but it will help you allot!

Some books that will help out:
The lean startup by Eric Ries
How make friends and influence them by Dale Carnegie (this is on of the best books I have ever read)
Marketing fundamentals by Bronislaw J. Verhage (In Holland this is the standard book for marketing at college/university.)

And google has all your answer if you don't know a technical term.
So does the reddit community. 

But asking this is my website and I want more customers can you help me out. The answer that you will get will be so unhelpful in 80% of the time because the possibilities are endless.


 




 Thanks!
May I ask why the aVF lead is almost flat? 

 




 Thanks for quick response.

Weird they still put those interpertation software in the machines when it is wrong quiet a few times.

But thanks again! 









 Great to see the dog is still alive! The men should be proud for saving the dog!

By the way why does the nurse have a hard on? 




 Marketing student here I'm glad to help out a bit.

First of try to read some books about marketing, Philip Kotler is a well respected marketing professor who wrote allot of good books try to buy or borrow some. Also coursera.org maybe has some marketing courses you can follow but I don't know if there are any at the moment.  
 
Why is this important?

It will help you to develop mission and vision, this is the most important thing of a company. From there you can develop your strategy.

An example of a mission, Facebook: "Facebooks mission is to give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected. People use Facebook to stay connected with friends and family, to discover whats going on in the world, and to share and express what matters to them."

With something like this in the back of your head you always know what direction you have to go with you company.

Do you want to focus on a niche market? Or do you want to focus on every household? Hipsters/rockers/hippies etc etc. This will help you to find the right places to advertise. But you want to advertise as little as possible with Facebook ads, magazine adds, newspapers ads those are very expensive and at this point you have to be very creative. You want that people find your products cool, so send some stuff to blogggers/youtubers and stuff like that who are interested in these products and are already talking about it maybe getting a shout out in exchange for some discount and that there viewers can get some discount?

Try to contact fancy.com they have very cool stuff and your products would fit in I guess. But you have allot of similar websites. A problem however with this type of selling is that there is another chain in the distribution channel and the more channels in there the more expensive your products get or the less profit you will make. There is also a chance that the manufacturer are already approaching them. But trying will never hurt you. Or maybe you can have a joint venture with them.
 
Now off to the social media. You need to add value to you posts not only "Hi there here is a picture of a product this is the price, buy it". Try to add value like simple facts: when the product was founded originally or something else people didn't knew about the product in general, they have to be amazed. People need to enjoy following your channel. 

About the flyers I would seriously consider to stop with those, they are very expensive. Unless they give you a solid income.
Always keep in mind I want to reach as much people with the least amount of money spent. 

Now about the website im gonna explain it like im doing a live review. 
Nice designed website with some great products! But a very wide product range, from bikes to hotdogs machines and from gameboys to a TETRIS blocks lamp. O boy I get very hungry of all those nice machines, Yes sir im hungry! Go to the menu lifestyle: No food machines huh they also sell bathroom products? And prints? 
Arcade: No food machines, 
Records: No Food machines and also I have to be honest I was expecting some CDs and Vinyls here maybe it is an idea to change Records in to Audio or audio products or something like that, Gifts: No food machines again but phone cases. So the food machines arent in the menu so only on the homepage.

The Menu is not well organized in my opinion and I dont get a good idea of what are all the types of products you are selling at the first glance of your website.
Seriously try to reorganize the menu that with every click in the menu I know what im doing.

So my advice:
Work on the menu make it very logical!

When visiting the homepage it has to be clear what you are selling.

Start studying some marketing it will help you allot and its also allot of fun to learn how people think. It will also provide you with some easy tools for example a SWOT analysis and allot more of that type of tools. 

Target your audience, it will be a lot easier to find you customers then because you know where to search. But again this is very hard and you maybe have to delete some products out of your company for that. 
The social media part I would recommend to make it more informative and fun to follow with nice facts! 

But the most important advice: Enjoy your brand new company!And truly give your soul and heart for it! And Congratulations!

Its a bit late now and im very tired + english is not my native language so im already apologizing for the bad grammar. Will read the whole text tomorrow again and where necessary I will make some logical corrections.

If you have more question or you need explanation feel absolutely free to ask and i will answer as soon as possible. 




 Well that a bit the brutal way, I was more thinking about a peaceful way. 




 Thanks! 




 Thanks! 




 With your own constitution, army, tax and stuff like that? 




 Do you have some articles about this? I'm very interested to read this! Because where I live they government is investing in all different cultures. 




 I read the article but the article is written in a context you think it only happens to "black" people, because they say we get POOR black guys  instead of a RICH white guy because they can afford a lawyer. This is a HUGE difference because this doesn't say its a racial thing but a money/wealth thing. White poor people have the same chance to get caught here as the poor black people.

I do believe there is racism and the world doesn't end with me. But it's getting so misused.

Not every time you are being treated bad you can't just say o thats racism!
