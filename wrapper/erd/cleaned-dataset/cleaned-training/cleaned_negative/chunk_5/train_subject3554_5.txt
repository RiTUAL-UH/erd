  That's awesome... Also one more quick question should I report the photos of political ads containing photos of aborted babies as bigotry? I feel I should because the comments are eighty percent arguments normally. 

well that's just made my brain hurt. If you feel it violates our rules, please do report it, we weigh each post/thread on it's merits, but a modmail gets quicker attention than a report 




   I'm guessing it's an inside joke amongst the mods and you. 

Yeah. Janitor icon=mop, new mods get threatened with the blunt end if they screw up, established mods get the sharp end of a rake :) We're a rough- -ready crew here in /wtf 









 gosh, I'm spoilt for choice ;) 














  so Microsoft getting them to transition to Windows 10 is going to be difficult.

then you can bet MS will simply fix the issue in Win 10 to please Enterprise 




 not gonna happen, upgrading hardware is VERY expensive for Enterprise when you might be replacing 100,000 units at a time, hence the need for legacy support 









 hmm, might need the wire-brush   dettol for THIS one ... 




 (waves mop cheerily) 




 we're shy :) 




 ahahahaha, if ONLY I could dance like that, [unfortunately](http://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/dancing.gif) ...

oh lawdie no, I didn't happen to repost something did I? Shoot me now, that's never happened in the history of reddit, EVER. Now weigh it up against the ORIGINAL content I have submitted here

 Gulaggh don't allow people to take their photo as they want to remain anonymous. In place of a band shot they offered up this drawing that one of their vocalists made in a psychotic state hours before he killed himself.

  Those trolls are a gathering of mentally unstable people with an obsession of hating Twit and Leo.

I love Leo, his work, his vocal skills, his longevity, but he proudly proclaims "I hide nothing, I want Google to know EVERYTHING about me",   so on, then comes all the issues you cited above. Really? Quelle surprise. As a mod of long-standing on reddit, with experience at Digg, NewsPond, Mixx blah blah I can honestly say you don't DEFEAT trolls, you deal with them. Closing down the online AI of TWiT is not "dealing" with anything, it's an admission of defeat,   that is a crying shame. Jeff Jarvis argues against such a stance on TWiG iirc. Odd thought, I'm listening to this week's Windows Weekly now,   Leo is referring to the chat room like nothing has happened? Am I missing something?

Edit: I'm not sure I see the correlation between shutting down live-streaming   trolls/bomb-threats etc? Why can't they live-stream without a live audience then? We'd still like to see what goes on behind-the-scenes/between-shows? 





























 TIL :)

 **was**, (  not because "so many of them rely on him to not totally fall apart", simply to allow me access to more spam), that exception was stripped from me at a later date 




  Englanders call them crisps or some shit.

[chips](http://fitchips.com.au/img/why-fc/chips.png) is what we Brits call French Fries, [crisps](http://www.artisserie.co.uk/media/859/crisps.jpg) are what we call the American chips 
























  Imo this is further indication that twit is morphing into something that -- long term --most core fans won't like. 

as a mod of nearly 40 subreddits here, I can say that if TWiT live-chat is brought to it's knees by "1 or 2 trolls" then someone needs to take a long look at their mods/methods. Hey, Uncle Leo, pay me! I mod /r/tnt, /r/iostoday   /r/twitaaa for you :) 




 Oh I don't know about that. They turn up with all their placards, ready to chant, and suddenly all they can see is white sheets, quite hilarious, imagining them on a knoll muttering amongst themselves 
























 Oh right, I never really look at that :)
