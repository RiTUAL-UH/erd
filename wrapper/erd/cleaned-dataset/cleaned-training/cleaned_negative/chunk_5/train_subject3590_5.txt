 Great! Def. my favorite lokum flavor! 




 I'm guessing this is Rose flavored? 




 Conflict resolution  




 pun intended  




 Yeah, you're thinking of the dream house! 




 Ruhlman's  20 is all you need!   




 lemongrass also has a softer "heart" that you can find if you shed away the stringy bits 




 Ecofriendly heaven excluding the toxic waste site that it's built upon. .  




 I hope you tipped the band! 




 Have you encountered any foreign elements offering to support  your efforts or pay you to deliver specific goods? 




 Everyone can agree that their mother's cuisine is the best! 




 I think Advieh is just persian for "spice mix" and can take many different forms 




 Cardamom is more indian \ subcontinental  




 As others have said it's a mix. What's in it is up to you but I'd say cumin is generally dominant. When I make lamb kfte \ merguez I use:

* 1 1/4 teaspoons ground cumin
* 1 1/4 teaspoons ground coriander (toasted)
* 1/2    teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1 1/4 teaspoons fennel seeds (toasted)
* 2 tablespoons harissa or ac biber salas
* 3 garlic cloves, minced
 




 I like sorel a lot - http://jackfrombrooklyn.com/  




 myst + simcity 




 agree that it's mastic. Try [making a pudding](http://ozlemsturkishtable.com/2012/09/milk-pudding-with-mastic-gum-and-rhubarb-compote/ ) from it instead of making Turkish Karanmaras dodurmasi as others have suggested which, at least when I've tried it in Turkey, doesn't really have much mastic flavor. oh and also Sahadi's is the best! 




 visa versa = why does a sponge become a brownie?! 




 uh, it would be kaleidoscopic and beautiful!  




 ramen? 




 At least on my instrument, that issue wouldn't make a sound. it would just be leaky and perhaps make the note out of tune. The reeds only sound from one direction and the leather prevents air from going through when the bellows are going the other way 




 Sorry I misspoke, I was referring to a putty knife not an offset spatula. Great for omelets, anything on a skillet, cleaning your cutting  board. I'm not professional but recently I've noticed one in every single professional kitchen I've peeked in. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Putty_knife
