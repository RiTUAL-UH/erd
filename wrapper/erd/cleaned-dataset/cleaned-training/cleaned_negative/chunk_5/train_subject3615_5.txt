 i remember seeing photos, which the FBI provided, with the guy in the doorway BLACKED OUT...(there's a photo of him crouching in the doorway in the video you linked to) 









 do a search within r/conspiracy...then pick and choose

also [whowhatwhy.org](http://whowhatwhy.org/) has a series which does not go into conspiracies but, instead, simply asks valid questions about the "investigation" 




 Everyone must be a detective...Each source must be measured and weighed accordingly...the corporate main stream media is, far too often, complicit in covering up facts and even goes as far as omitting the entire story...case in point: the build up to the Iraq War (see Bill Moyer's [BUYING THE WAR](https://vimeo.com/33033186))...the New York Times, still to this day, covers up any possibility that there was a conspiracy in the JFK whackjob. these cover-ups or omissions are referred to as Deep Politics by researcher/author Peter Dale Scott.  

History matters because we must know what happened in order to judge if our government is acting responsibly. As it stands We, the People cannot do this because the USG allows the CIA-FBI-NSA to hide such a large portion of our own history from us. Why is the USG hiding the security footage from the 89 cameras which the FBI confiscated from around the Pentagon on 9/11???  Why does the USG not allow us to view records from WWII??? There are even records from the 1920 bombing of Wall Street which a Yale history professor, Beverly Gage, was not allowed to view for her book *The Day Wall Street Exploded* (2008).  In fact, the USG would not release even 1 new file even though the files were 85 years old.  How do we know if the FBI or CIA or NSA are acting within the law???  How do we know if the CIA or NSA or the Pentagon haven't taken control of the USG???  

Answer: We can't know how to judge their actions if We, the People are not given access to their files. Of course, the agencies may omit information, but most likely there will be clues left for researchers to decipher. 

I have started a subreddit, [r/TSBD](http://np.reddit.com/r/TSBD/), which is focused on pdf files of "conspiracy" books and author interviews as a reference tool.  Hope you get a chance to read up and learn!!! 




 that used to be how it worked in america...nowadays, for any serious crime, the suspect is fucking slammed in jail before trial--look at any big murder case..."justice" is fucking DEAD in the u.s. and democracy is a fucking illusion...WTFU 




 the Iraq War was really more about the PetroDollar than the neo-cons deep love of human rights...ever see the photo of that [psychopath donald rumsfeld shaking Saddam's hand](http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB82/)??? (it was 2 months after Saddam had gassed the Kurds--yet that psychopath donald rumsfeld kept selling Saddam weapons)... 









 Whether or not the soldiers were drafted has NOTHING to do with a ILLEGAL WAR which resulted in 1,000,000+ DEAD IRAQIS.  How the FUCK do you link that together???

The whole entire reason for the Iraq War was a fucking LIE.  




 Some people compared Iraq to Vietnam--but, in reality, it's 10 times fucking WORSE.

Time to send the Bush-Cheney neo-cons to Guantanamo for PROSECUTION. (and YES, Obama is a War Criminal, too.) 







































 Too much money to be made by WAR:
The 3.2 million employed by the Pentagon make money...the weapons manufacturers make money...the private defense contractors make money...the intelligence agencies make money...the private intelligence corporations make money...the construction and industrial builders make money...the energy companies make money...the media companies make money...the technology and software companies make money...the transportation companies (airlines, trains, buses) make money...the medical device companies make money...the pharmaceutical companies make money...the lobbyists make money...the bankers make money...the attorneys make money...the investors make money... 




 The generals have to switch over from the Pentagon to defense companies so they can make their millions...and the CIA has to protect their heroin supply. 




 google is also completely fucking up the outcomes of searches...

..and what the fuck is with google images--now only 10 thumb nails pull up (before a whole page of 50 or more would show)...

fuck you google...duckduckgo.com, it is. 




 FUCK these LIARS...do cops trust suspects after they have lied???


 




 Dancing is out of control these days--just try dancing at the [Jefferson Memorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4ltTmp8xto)... 




 guess who is Now our Sec. of Defense? 

ashton b. carter (co-wrote paper with zelikow) 









 Unfortunately, he is RIGHT...The Establishment has WON...

Has anyone been investigated or charged???

Has the NSA (and their corporate dregs) lost funding???

Has Congress even held any valid hearings???

No. No. No....

Most likely Snowden is a Limited Hangout.

Series of articles on Gary Webb by [consortium news](https://consortiumnews.com/tag/gary-webb/)

Also read an excellent update by the Intercept:  

[MANAGING A NIGHTMARE: HOW THE CIA WATCHED OVER THE DESTRUCTION OF GARY WEBB](https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/09/25/managing-nightmare-cia-media-destruction-gary-webb/)
On September 18, the agency released a trove of documents spanning three decades of secret government operations. Culled from the agencys in-house journal, Studies in Intelligence, the materials include a previously unreleased six-page article titled Managing a Nightmare: CIA Public Affairs and the Drug Conspiracy Story. Looking back on the weeks immediately following the publication of Dark Alliance, the document offers a unique window into the CIAs internal reaction to what it called a genuine public relations crisis while revealing just how little the agency ultimately had to do to swiftly extinguish the public outcry. Thanks in part to what author Nicholas Dujmovic, a CIA Directorate of Intelligence staffer at the time of publication, describes as a ground base of already productive relations with journalists, the CIAs Public Affairs officers watched with relief as the largest newspapers in the country rescued the agency from disaster, and, in the process, destroyed the reputation of an aggressive, award-winning reporter.

 Give Jake McFerren or Gen. Stanley McChrystal a call--I'm sure no reporter has bothered to ask!!! 




 Hastings did actually write about being threatened in his last (and final) book, *The Operators*: 

------
(page 64)

Jake came up to me. "We'll hunt you down and kill you if we don't like what you write," he said. "C. will hunt you down and kill you."

[note: Jake McFerren is General McChrystal's top civilian political advisor responsible for helping foster international relations with the 44 coalition countries involved in Afghanistan. Jake was also McChrystal's West Point roommate and drinking buddy....C. was a member of the SAS, the most elite British commando unit]

-----

(page 88)

"Sorry about threatening to kill you," Jake said. It was the first time anyone in the group had acknowledged the blowout on Friday night. 

"Yeah, geez, the guy is just trying to do his job," McChrystal said. 

"No worries. Like I said, it happens all the time, but yeah, you're probably the highest rank to do so," I said.

I laughed, and they didn't.

As a side note:  Jeremy Scahill was also threatened (most likely by JSOC)--you can see him answer his cellphone and receive the threat in his documentary *Dirty Wars* 




 Interesting to search for "September 2002 iraq sued" turns up very few actual articles...the Propaganda gained from the U.S. by this move was quite tangible: Front Page headlines battering the unsuspecting minds of Americans unwilling (or unable) to see through the lies. 

i also think the lawsuit helped Kenneth Feinberg pressure the 9/11 Victims' Family Compensation Fund participants into working with him--note the 1,400 participants would be over half of the 2,700 or so killed in the WTC attacks...

In order to be included in the Victims Families Fund, participation was placed under a 2 year timeline imposed by Feinberg. Was the 2 year time period imposed by Feinberg also a factor in mandating the 9/11 Commission Report be finished in such a short 16 month time frame? obviously there was an election--but i think the 2 year time frame was a more important consideration for the Bush-Cheney administration.

wonder if there are any Feinberg-Cheney ties (Cheney does go all the way back to the Nixon era)...wonder if Cheney ever came across Feinberg during the Agent Orange lawsuits (Cheney was Sec. of Defense under GHW Bush when some of the Agent Orange settlements may have been active...not sure, but I think Feinberg may have worked on the Agent Orange settlements.)

I also wonder how the [9/11 Victims' Compensation Fund](http://cryptome.org/doj122101.txt) was written, voted on and passed by Congress in just 10 fucking days--on Sept. 21...obviously the u.s. was stricken with fear and congress would have put their stamp on just about anything at the time--the important thing for the Compensation Fund was to put victims/families into the lawsuit and thereby placing them under some secrecy rules which the victims and families most likely had to agree to. Overall, Cheney saw the 9/11 Victims' Families Compensation Fund as a way to SILENCE those closest to the scene of the crime...these 9/11 victims and families were those with the most interest in asking questions and demanding answers--a very important group to silence (or at least have under official observation and controllable). 




 Anyone else remember that in [Sept 2002: 1,400 victims/families of the 9/11 attacks sued Iraq for $1 TRILLION](http://www.historycommons.org/timeline.jsp?timeline=complete_911_timeline the_post-9/11_world=complete_911_timeline_9_11_related_lawsuits)...

YES, Iraq...

..it got headlines--but went fucking nowhere...these lawsuits are often just PROPAGANDA for the U.S. to grab headlines and smear the opponent in slime to the unsuspecting (duped) public.

September 4, 2002: Iraq Sued for Conspiring with Al-Qaeda in 9/11 Attacks  

Over 1,400 relatives of 9/11 attack victims sue Iraq for more than $1 trillion, claiming there is evidence Iraq conspired with al-Qaeda on the 9/11 attacks. [CBS NEWS, 9/5/2002] 

One of the key pieces of evidence cited is an article in a small town Iraqi newspaper written by Naeem Abd Muhalhal on July 21, 2001. He describes bin Laden thinking seriously, with the seriousness of the Bedouin of the desert, about the way he will try to bomb the Pentagon after he destroys the White House. He adds that bin Laden is insisting very convincingly that he will strike America on the arm that is already hurting, which has been interpreted as a possible reference to the 1993 bombing of the WTC. Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein apparently praised this writer on September 1, 2001. The lawsuit is based largely on the idea that Iraqi officials were aware of plans to attack American landmarks, yet did not warn their archenemy, the US. [ASSOCIATED PRESS, 9/4/2002] 

Former CIA agent and terrorism consultant Robert Baer is hired by the prosecuting legal team to find evidence of a meeting between Mohamed Atta and Iraqi agents on April 8, 2001, but despite the help of the CIA, he is unable find any evidence of such a meeting. [CBS NEWS, 9/5/2002]

Since we don't have evidence, we'll just sue them for a TRILLION dollars!!! The media will eat it up!!!

 excellent point...In December 2000, Saddam switched his banking to the Euro in the UN Oil-for-Food program.

----------------------

According to page 28 of Clarks book:

On September 24, 2000, Saddam Hussein allegedly emerged from a meeting of his government and proclaimed that Iraq would soon transition its oil export transactions to the euro currency.

Not long after this meeting, Saddam Hussein began preparing to make the switch from pricing his countrys oil exports in greenbacks to euros. As renegade and newsworthy as this action was on the part of Iraq, it was sparsely reported in the corporate-controlled media.

Clark comments on the limited media coverage on page 31 of his book:

CNN ran a very short article on its website on October 30, 2000, but after this one-day news cycle, the issue of Iraqs switch to a petroeuro essentially disappeared from all five of the corporate-owned media outlets.
By 2002, Saddam had fully converted to a petroeuro  in essence, dumping the dollar.

On March 19, 2003, George W. Bush announced the commencement of a full scale invasion of Iraq.

According to Clark and Engdahl, Saddams bold threat to the petrodollar system had invited the full force and fury of the U.S. military onto his front lawn.

 --------------------------

No proof of that...but [Bush and Cheney did, on multiple occasions, ask Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle NOT to investigate 9/11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePOIhhd9Jr0)...neither Bush nor Cheney would  testify under oath and in public before the 9/11 Commission...

Please watch this [ENTIRE 5 MINUTE PRESS CONFERENCE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bnuvtRo8b0) Bush held afterwards...NOT even 10 questions!!! 

IRONIC--the man who couldn't quit saying "9/11" couldn't face the 9/11 Commission in public and under oath!!! Watch the body language and listen closely!!! Notice Bush doesn't say HE TESTIFIED--rather he says "had a good conversation".

 google "syria oil pipeline" and do your own research, but it's the timing and the analysis that counts: (from article)

The last Iraq war wasnt about weapons of mass destruction. It was about oil. **We borrowed the money from the Chinese** so that we could make it safe for the Chinese and Exxon to frack Iraq. Bombing Syria is not about a chemical weapons of mass destruction. Its about the rivalry between competing gas pipeline projects  one that has been proposed to take gas from Quatar to Europe  via Syria and Turkey. The other proposed from Iran, via Iraq, Syria and Lebanon: The Battle of Pipelineistan - fought by US troops  on behalf of Quatar, Israel, Turkey, Europeans  everybody but Americans  to resolve who gets the gas line concession through Syria. Its about that simple.

I also found this article about Syria discovering oil in 2011 very interesting as well...

 I interpreted the comments as leaning towards a SET UP in which shots were fired by authorities (or some provocateurs) in an attempt to frame the protestors in a bad light and cause public opinion to blame the movement. not sure if you are familiar with [COINTELPRO](http://www.freedomarchives.org/Documents/Finder/Black%20Liberation%20Disk/Black%20Power!/SugahData/Government/COINTELPRO.S.pdf), but there was some crazy F'ed up things in the 50's, 60's and 70's which J. Edgar Hoover (FBI) was in charge of. 

as for the possible charges:  I would definitely think firing a rubber bullet at a person would be attempted murder--it could hit someone in the eye. 

more charges would be added on if the attempt was on an officer. 

even more charges if it was in front of a large crowd. 

even more more charges if it was a situation involving race.

A 15-month investigation by the Guardian and BBC Arabic reveals how retired US colonel James Steele, a veteran of American proxy wars in El Salvador and Nicaragua, played a key role in training and overseeing US-funded special police commandos who ran a network of torture centres in Iraq. Another special forces veteran, Colonel James Coffman, worked with Steele and reported directly to General David Petraeus, who had been sent into Iraq to organise the Iraqi security services

 Perkins' analysis seems to be that the U.S. was too involved with Afghanistan and Iraq to be able to pay attention to finish up in Venezuela. The Bush-Cheney administration cut back on Venezuelan oil imports--in 200 it was 19% of the U.S. supply, it was tapered off to about 10% by the 2010...

https://twitter.com/WyzeChef re-tweets "Reformed Savage's" comment (scroll down to March 12)

consider the comments on the the strong distrust within the community and the history of COINTEL

----------

1st comment by "Reformed Savage":

**A rubber bullet rifle would explain a lot. The sound. The accuracy. The miraculous recovery time. And of course the motive**.

2nd comment by "Reformed Savage":

**Shot in the face and released hours later? I wonder if the officer got shot in the face with a rubber bullet**.

edit: another commentor states journos and witnesses say the shots were fired 125 yards away...here are some direct links to various comments:

At the last, Dwight Eisenhower exploded in anger and frustration.  "The structure of our intelligence organization is faulty," he told Allen Dulles. It makes no sense, it has to be reorganized, and we should have done it long ago. Nothing had changed since Pearl Harbor. "I have suffered an eight-year defeat on this," said the president of the United States. He said he would "leave a legacy of ashes" to his successor.

 Very NICE of Usama bin Laden to thank the Pakistanis for the hospitality for 10 years (or so)...kind of funny that after 9/11 the u.s. ran around Afghanistan paying warlords to find bin Laden--but he got away to Pakistan...then, in 2002, the u.s. starts paying Pakistan $3 billion a year in military aid...was part of the $3 billion to take good care of bin Laden?

well, at least after a decade the u.s. figured that out and finally quit giving the Pakistanis $3 billion a year. 




 Maybe the age of enlistment should be fucking raised to 21 as well... 




 well, the BCCI bank started in Pakistan with Saudi money--YES.

the Saudis kicked in $25 million a year to the CIA to help fund the Contras in the 80's...no doubt they still fund plenty 




 Ever wonder why the u.s. began giving $3 billion a year in military aid to pakistan after 9/11? were they paying pakistan to hide Usama bin Laden???

and why did the head of pakistan's ISI quit after 9/11? hmmm... 




 oh my GOD...PEACE TALKS...

WHO wants to read about that??? 




 ----------

from Prologue:

No longer a traditional espionage service devoted to stealing the secrets of foreign governments, the Central Intelligence Agency has become a killing machine, an organization consumed with man hunting.

And just as the CIA has come to take on tasks traditionally associated with the military, with spies turned into soldiers, so has the opposite occurred. The American military has been dispersed into the dark spaces of American foreign policy, with commando teams running spying missions that Washington would never have dreamed of approving in the years before 9/11. Prior to the attacks of September 11, the Pentagon did very little human spying, and the CIA was not officially permitted to kill. In the years since, each has done a great deal of both, and a military-intelligence complex has emerged to carry out the new American way of war.

Combined with the fact that the videos destruction almost certainly constitutes obstruction of justice with regard to numerous judicial proceedings as well, **were talking here about extremely serious felonies at the highest levels of our government**.

 IRONIC that in 1950, the U.S. had 300 nuclear weapons...in 1960 the U.S. had 18,000 nuclear weapons...Ike turned the keys over to JFK after he had once mentioned to his secretary he feared he might leave his successor a ["legacy of ashes."](http://cdn.preterhuman.net/texts/government_information/intelligence_and_espionage/Legacy.of.Ashes-The.History.of.the.CIA.pdf) 




 albright had no problem with killing over 500,000 children...

i'm sure she'll get over me stuffing a few words into her bloody mouth 




 No repercussions!!!

the IG wrote a report (without the 90 videotapes the CIA destroyed), then the Senate Select Cmte on Intelligence decided to spend 4 years and $40 million to re-write the Torture Report (so the SERFS of America could read the report). By contrast the 9/11 Commission was only initially awarded $3 million and given 16 months to complete their official report.

 there were less than [5,000 U.S. military deaths in the "Iraq War"](http://antiwar.com/casualties/)--compared to  1.5 million Iraqis

The U.S. military withdrawal from Afghanistan poses an enormous logistical challenge. The landlocked country is halfway around the world, has few rail lines and poor roads, and is ringed by mountainous terrain. By the end of next year, U.S. officials say, they need to pull out 24,000 vehicles and 20,000 shipping containers, one way or another.

The Pentagon has budgeted $5 billion to $7 billion to ship all that gear home. But the final tab will hinge greatly on the extent to which the military can rely on the ground routes through Pakistan.

...

Ammunition, weaponry and other sensitive materials must be transported by air for security reasons. About 28 percent of cargo is being flown all the way back to the United States, and 50 percent is flown to seaports in the Middle East, then loaded onto ships for the remainder of the journey.


The more we put on the [Pakistan route], hopefully the more money all of us will have in our pockets, the defense official said. Its cheaper and just as effective if its working.

**What about the unredacted files of the the U.S. activists who were spied on during the civil rights movement?**

NSA-FBI Spied on U.S. Senators, MLK, activists in 1960's (entire article based on release of just 1 page of NSA internal history document): http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/09/25/secret-cold-war-documents-reveal-nsa-spied-on-senators/

The names of the NSAs targets are eye-popping. Civil rights leaders Martin Luther King and Whitney Young were on the watch list, as were the boxer Muhammad Ali, New York Times journalist Tom Wicker, and veteran Washington Post humor columnist Art Buchwald. But perhaps the most startling fact in the declassified document is that the NSA was tasked with monitoring the overseas telephone calls and cable traffic of two prominent members of Congress, Sen. Frank Church (D-Idaho) and Sen. Howard Baker (R-Tenn.).

I think 9/11 as a community needs to arrange a corporate media BOYCOTT. I know this has been tried [before](http://911truthnews.com/mainstream-media-boycott-for-911-justice/)--but right now seems a great time: 

-----------

http://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/why_boycotts_succeed_and_fail


Boycotts may not need to affect sales at all in order to be effective, he writes. Rather, boycotters influence stems from their ability to make negative claims about the corporation that generate negative public perceptions of the corporation. Hence, corporations that are already struggling to maintain their previously positive reputations will be more likely to concede to boycotts and quell any further damage the boycott may do to their reputation.

According to a CIA internal memo dated November 29, 1975,[2] Zapata Petroleum began in 1953 through Bush's joint efforts with Thomas J. Devine, a CIA staffer who had resigned his agency position that same year to go into private business, but who continued to work for the CIA under commercial cover. Devine would later accompany Bush to Vietnam in late 1967 as a "cleared and witting commercial asset" of the agency, acted as his informal foreign affairs advisor, and had a close relationship with him through 1975.[3]

The CIA Old Boys were reeling. In the 1970s, exposure of their dirty games and dirty tricks made the Cold Warriors look sinister -- and silly. Then, President Carter ordered a housecleaning that left scores of CIA men out in the cold. 

In 1980, the CIA men wanted back in and their champion was former CIA director George Bush. With Bush and Ronald Reagan in power, the old spies could resume their work with a vengeance. The temptation was to do to Jimmy Carter what the CIA had done to countless other world leaders -- overthrow him, a frightening chapter
