 If you trace your family tree back to approximately 1000 AD and made a list of all your direct ancestors, you will find that you will have written down more names than there have ever been human beings on Earth.

 Yes. My main sauce is Christopher Hitchen's book '*The Missionary Position*', I suggest you start there. There are plenty more; several documentaries have interviewed Nuns previously in Mother Teresa's employ who worked at the hospices. Plenty of people visited the hospices, especially in Calcutta and gave plenty of evidence to the squalid conditions. There is a huge amount of sauce material on this.

Before Bernie Madoff broke the record, the largest fraud in history was done by a man named Charles Keating. Keating donated much of his ill gotten money to Mother Teresa's organisation. After he was caught it was requested that Teresa give the money back, though she had no legal obligation to do so, so it could be returned to those who had been defrauded by Keating. Not one penny was returned. This is historical fact. Just because you have not looked up the sauces, does not mean they do not exist or aren't credible.  



















 Not at all. I have explained my opinion. If you want to disagree with me that is your privilege. I have better things to do than troll the internet though 




 Agreed, and Mother Teresa absolutely shouldn't be.

EDIT: allow me to clarify. Mother Teresa is one of those people who gained a reputation by having a reputation. She did not, as some of you fine people appear to think, save millions of lives, or even improve the condition of those lives. She ran hospices for the dying. According to credible sauces those in her care were not allowed medicine or visits from family or friends and were expected to suffer and die. In fact, Teresa herself many times spoke of how important 'suffering' was to her ministry. Meanwhile she is flying around the world shaking hands and accepting cheques from all sorts of highly reputable people, such as Charles Keating or the dictators of Haiti. She was given the Nobel Peace Prize for aparently no reason at all (as was Obama and Kissinger, but thats another story), and in her acceptance speech claimed that "abortion is the biggest risk to peace". She had very little influence on the world yet gained a huge reputation, and is remember for her reputation rather than her deeds, which are questionable at best and deceitful despicable at worst.
I have been as concise as I can here, and this is the tip of the tip of the iceberg. I am not simply being brave or edgy.

 I find it slightly bizarre and disturbing that as president, you would have to approach religious authorities to issue a fatwa against execution of gays, rather than use your own authority. I understand that this may be necessary due to the power held by the mullahs or the ayatollah. Perhaps it may be more appropriate to attempt to limit the power held by these figures sir, or would that be political suicide? The opinion of many people in the western world is if peace is to be had and Iran to progress as a 21st century nation, the power held by religious agencies must be limited and separated from political matters. I would love to know your opinion on this.

Stuff like that? Far too many people hold Jesus up as a moral exemplar, the truth of the matter is that the Jesus of the Bible was racist, immoral and tied to wish-thinking and belief in magic. True he is an improvement over the genocidal maniac of the Old Testament, but that is much like saying Stalin wasn't quite as bad as Hitler. No, Jesus was not a great teacher, we do not need his example.

 [Some information on Trotsky](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Trotsky). Here is [another example of Soviet picture editing](http://imgur.com/IfCz5O5.jpg), in this case it is Nikolai Yezhov, former head of the NKVD (Stalin's secret police) who was edited out of many photos after his execution.

Also, notice several other men have been edited out (the man with two to the left of Lenin as well as the man with the dark beard in the foreground). It is unclear who they are or why they were removed however, in my opinion they are probably Trotsky sympathisers.

 The night is black as I lay in the sheets

My eyes are heavy as I prepare for my sleep

Suddenly a noise, I've heard it before

The sound of the creature hidden therein

I calm myself down, there's no need to be scared

I padlocked his cage, he's going nowhere 




 "Mommy Mommy, I saw a monster!" Timmy shrieked as he rushed out of the bathroom and into his mothers arms.

Smiling very slightly the mother held her son as he hugged her in fright, stroking his hair soothingly. "I've told you Timmy there's no such thing as monsters! You have such an imagination! Where did you see it?"

"In the bathroom," Timmy said in a small voice, still clutching his mother as all small children will do when they are frightened.

Mother knew her son had an overactive imagination and would not be able to sleep until she had proven there was no monster to him. She glanced up at the bathroom door, which had been left ajar.

A thrill of horror shot up her spine as she saw the mirror. Suddenly she felt the bile rising in her throat as though she was about to be sick. Her son was still reflected in the glass as though he was still standing before the mirror, yet her son had never looked like this, never looked so evil.

The thing in the mirror that so resembling her son gazed malevolently back out at her, an evil smile rising on its face. Its lips started to move.

"Let's play," said Timmy.

 In the time it takes you to realise what is wrong, it will already be too late 




 Part of me salutes you for this response as you are, like so many other people have done, bending over backwards to make something that is so painfully obviously immoral into something good. Your explanation of original sin is good, mankind by its very nature is selfish, it is one of the three most obvious products of our long evolution (These being: self-preservation, the impulse for food and the impulse for sex). This helps to make nonsense of the commandment '*Love Thy Neighbour as you would yourself*'. The thing simply cannot be done, the most altruistic, loving person you know would not be able to accomplish such a feat. HOWEVER, though I respect your argument, *this is not an explanation of Original Sin*. Not even close. This is you attempt to justify an obviously immoral practise, for which I do not blame you. Original Sin is the hereditary blame passed down through the male line for Eve's bite from the fruit of knowledge. It is punishment that every human being inherits from the moment of conception for the crime committed by a distant ancestor. *This is not moral*. Just to compound the offence, let us look again at the 10 commandments. The punishment God lays down for making a graven image is: "*I the Lord your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generation*". The punishment of children for the crimes of their parents or grandparents is universally considered immoral today, let alone the condemnation of the entire human race for a non-crime committed, that hurt no one, by a fictional character in the antiquated past. This is, there is no other word, evil. I respect your attempt to square this by granting a different explanation, but by its very nature you can not cherry pick religion. 




 Please do not cast this response aside as argumentative, I would like to provide a reasoned counter argument to your comment but I do not wish to offend anyone.

What I find deeply troubling and disturbing about what you have said is that /u/kblaxchick "*is a sinner and deserves to be tossed into a lake of fire*". Yet you don't know this person and neither do I, the odds are that no one on this thread knows this person well enough to make any sort of judgement close to that in magnitude; it is a serious thing to say. Yet, because of what we already know about Christianity, this statement is normal and fair and you got 5 up-votes. We should see there is something wrong here. Christianity teaches, as you have already acknowledged, that *all* people, every man woman and child, is a sinner and should burn in torment forever and ever. Take a moment to consider, *why*? It is something more sinister than emotional blackmail, due to the condemnation of our basic human urges every Christian child has it burned into their mind that they are wicked and are going to go to hell if they don't believe in Jesus. You may say it is not like that, but you have already shown that this thought-process is 'normal' and to a child's mind visions of hellfire and the devil are more than just stories. The conscription of children for the purpose of this kind of blackmail is evil, there is no other word. If you had not had this done to you as a child, you might not have been so quick to call /u/blaxchick a sinner deserving of hell. If we are all sinners then God should have taken care to create a different species. It is the classic dogma of a person being created sick, and commanded on pain of eternal torment to be well. Christopher Hitchens compared it to living in a theological North Korea, "*but at least you can fucking die and leave North Korea.*" 




 Thank you for your response! I don't want to offend anyone so before I write a response of my own, would you welcome a reasonable theological discussion about what you have written or would you take offence?  




 If I may interject, I don't think an adversarial debate is really getting anyone anywhere, so lets put our pitchforks down shall we? 

As to /u/josh_thompson's point about historical evidence of The Bible. I'm afraid he does have a strong argument, there is excellent archeological as well as historic evidence that there was no exile from Egypt, there was no wandering in the desert. There have been many archeological attempts to research these topics, all of which overwhelmingly agree that these stories are erroneous. There are other checkable dates or events in The Bible that have since proven to be inaccurate after careful research, for example the census at the time of Jesus' birth and Noah's flood, for examples. If these stories are true they are checkable and verifiable through a number of methods, and the unavoidable fact is there is plenty of evidence to show that they are not true; they are myths, stories and parables. Now look at other Bible stories such as Abraham's readiness to sacrifice Isaac, or the slaughtering of the citizens of Sodom, Gomorra or Jericho, the detailed commandments on the keeping of slaves. In that light, aren't you just a little glad that The Bible is not infallible? 

As for /u/this_to_shall_pass's points about science. You are quite correct, there are many complicated things that science as yet can not fully explain, although not the items you list. The danger comes when we start to see the holes in science and automatically fill them with God. For a great deal of history God was credited with the creation of humanity. We now know, thanks to Darwin, that we have a entirely satisfactory explanation for the existence of complex life, thus God is demoted to sunsets and mountains etc (all of which are perfectly explainable). This is called '*God of the gaps*', and most theists (believers) try to avoid due to its fickle nature. Just because science cannot yet explain something, that gives no indication that God is any more credible, and when science discovers an explanation for a phenomena such as gravity, geology or life on Earth, God is instantly discredited.

As to my own point of view. I look at the world (and my own human body) and I see extraordinary wonder in the complexity and beauty of what we all have. The chance that every human is given at life is precious beyond words because of its uniqueness and finiteness. You will never have a second chance at living this life and there is so much wonder to be seen and had that makes life precious, the most precious commodity there is. The idea that this life is a mere waiting room, a passage to the hereafter (incidentally, if life after death is infinite, what exactly is the reason for this life, or Earth at all?) then that utterly demeans life and destroys its value. Your life is so precious because it will never come again. You only have one chance to make the very most you can of it. Don't waste it.

Please don't think I am being aggressive or argumentative in this response, I felt it might be useful to open a reasonable discussion on this, rather than an aggressive discussion, and I welcome any response that is reasonable. 




 In a completely respectful way, I would like to ask you to explain why this is? Please do not mistake me for the classic Reddit-style 'fire and brimstone' atheist, I am simply curious about your faith, and would love to hear your point of view! 




 It would end in a fist-fight between Hitler and Stalin while Mao quietly commits atrocities under the table. 




 I don't think it is the default. It is just that a lot of people express their (pretty lame) dig at society or social norms by posting on /r/athiesm. Not to say that there aren't plenty of thought out, intelligent posts on there as well. 




 Pretty much every line in 'A Hard Rains A-Gonna Fall' 




 No. Just like all things in The Bible there is no way of quantifying these facts and this is merely someones opinion, not a historically accurate and verifiable fact. Personally, due to the actual quote being *'The valley of the shadow of Death'* I would say it is very obviously metaphor for living in adversity.

Also this is a reverse causation. There exists now a valley called that. That does not however mean that that is what the line refers to. It may be more accurate to assume that the valley is named for the psalm, not vice versa. 




 Is...is that why its called pi? 




 pedanticism is not a sense of humour.

 I take this to be a metaphor for absolute confidence going in followed by instant disaster. 




 Nothing in life is ever this simple. I think your username is a lie! 




 If you have to ask that question, I think its fair to say the answer is 'yes' 




 Two of my grandparents had bi-polar, so there is fairly even chance I will develop it in later life and I am already showing signs (I'm 22). I absolutely empathise with the difficulty of knowing there is a chance you will not always been mentally "normal", it can be quite a burden to bare.
