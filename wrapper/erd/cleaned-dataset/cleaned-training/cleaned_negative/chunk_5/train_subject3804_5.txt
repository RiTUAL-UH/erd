 Humans. Humans never change. 

I kinda do see this becoming reality one day, as history repeats itself. We'd find a weaker, submissive race and make them do our dirty work. 

We'd have a war or two to free them.
Then they'd fight for their civil rights.
And the next thing you know, we'll have legal inter-species relations with them.

I love humans! 




 You must have been petrified.
