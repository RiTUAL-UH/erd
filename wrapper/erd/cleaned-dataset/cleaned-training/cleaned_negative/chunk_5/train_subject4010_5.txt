 In The Loop has pretty pedestrian cinematography, but that film is all about its script. And that was one fucking great script. 




 That's a good article. Although one point I'd like to add is that George Miller, John Seale and Margaret Sixel storyboarded, shot and edited the film to achieve total spatial clarity in Fury Road's action sequences. Whereas spatial clarity in Ultron seems like more of an afterthought to the dialogue and character development Joss Whedon was focusing on. Like it was something that could be done almost solely in post.
