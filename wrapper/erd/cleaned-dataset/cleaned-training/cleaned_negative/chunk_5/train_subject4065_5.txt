 ah, wish I could help. I don't know what's available around there. I've heard of sovernet and vtel as providers, you could look them up. Not sure if Fairpoint serves there, but their service is hit-or-miss depending on where (ie. you exact house location relative to their equipment) you live. 




 depends on where you live. 




 Oh man...that worries me. If an offensive lineman isn't motivated by the guy lining up across from him bent on ripping apart the guy he's paid to protect then he'll never be motivated. No amount of money or yelling would do it. Change of scenery...well we'll see I guess. 




 This helps us how? Another mediocre guy for defenses to humiliate on their short journey to Tannehill. 




 Mike Sherman is not the problem.

1) Tannehill hands the ball to the Bills for a TD on the first drive, then fumbles for them in the 4th quarter when we had the lead.
2) Our o-line lets more guys in than a cheap hooker. Yesterday's "improved" o-line performance (measuring sacks) was a mask. Tannehill was able to buy more time by rolling out and we ran better, but they did not play better.

It's really easy to call out coaches as the problem, but you don't know what play was called, when Tannehill audibled out, how they prepared...do you expect Sherman to suit up and play tackle? Or run on the field and stop Tannehill's occasional bad decision? 




 I've been playing the game just fine on windows 8, but it constantly crashes on 8.1. Googling shows others with similar issues. 

Be warned.  




 Thanks for the suggestion, I'll take a look at Roku! 




 I want to get something to play digital movies I have on a hard drive on my TV (I've tried Plex through my blu-ray and for some reason it always craps out after about 45 minutes).

Any experience with the below? Other recommendations?

 Taking away from EMDs is speculation. After the most recent Penguin update I'm seeing multiple reports of EMDs rebounding. 




 I just had to totally furnish my place (divorce sad face). I found Willie D's to have good deals on some quality stuff.

Ashley Furniture too depending on your price range. 




 Latoya? 




 awesome! needs to be compiled into a wallpaper...maybe a project for the weekend. 




 Like farts? 




 Should have guessed it was you since the pose was so on. 

Definitely post your film! 




 Good job dude. I like your concept, and your hunter buddy has a great stance! 




 Where can I stream this with decent quality? 









 Such a good movie.  




 Awesome! Love to hear that! These players deserve that support. 




 I feel like the Phins have played better teams than the Pats (and we've been on the road), and with us both at 3-0 it'll be good to see how the Pats do against the Falcons next week. 

I'm sure the dirty birds will be pissed too. 




 Awesome to hear! I hope that all those people experiencing a great win will mean more will return for future games. 




 Ditto. I'm stuck in New England. If I was around Miami I'd have season tickets. 




 I haven't heard noise like that from the Dolphins stadium since Marino! 




 Cool! Please share your final! :) 




 Them holding hands makes it a bromance movie. 




 UVM alumn here. I drive by that spot often. Apparently not at the right times. 




 Been there. Confront him in public, in front of his friends. Be fearless.  




 1,2,3,4. You know what I mean.  




 Crappy quality.  




 Thanks for the detail! 




 Hi reddit.

I want to paint a wall in my new place and there are large screw holes (where material is actually protruding out) and a few holes that look like their were filled with some cement like material -- where the cement is not flush but again protruding out.

Pictures: http://imgur.com/a/kl8Iz

What's the best way to fix these? Probably a noob question, but I'm a noob to this kind of stuff.

Thanks for any help!

oh, and I'm in New England (U.S.) 




 Introduce yourself and ask people about themselves. Get them talking, people love talking about themselves. 

There's an expression that I use to my advantage "being interested is interesting".   




 It was called "Puppy Go Home." A card game I would play with my Dad where the rules would change based on the cards I had. I always won, go figure. 




 Good points.

As you were. 




 It's not against balance, you just may not understand the rest of the mod. Good players can dead stop a hunter (I can the majority of the time on standard servers), and great ones can cut a smoker's tongue before being wrapped in it (I have a tougher time with that one).

Play on evilmania's servers and you'll see what I mean. Infected teams can select the special infected they want to be (can't duplicate an infected without spending points that are collected by playing) and Survivors can purchase weapons or health. It's not for everyone, but if you've been playing for a while and are fairly skilled it adds another level of strategy. 




 Nice! 




 The Browns home opener? 




 You shouldn't quit just because your team isn't doing well. 

Sounds like you were on a modded server.  




 Your girlfriend does for me.  




 Whoa whoa whoa!

Before this gets all ugly in here let's get something very clear. They're called "Caucasians". 




 and now it's down :( 

someone upload it! 




 Agreed. Great character development. Hulk had heart.  




 Kind of like Seinfeld for me. He just IS funny. He could recite a recipe for Mexican wedding cakes and I'd laugh.  




 Turkey I assume.  




 Moving to the noosk Friday. What have I done! 




 The average person eats 8 spiders a year.  




 I'll try that some day. Thanks! 




 I saw that movie for a different reason. Dat ass.  




 No fucking way.

No.

Fucking.

Way. 




 You use up more ammo that way. 

Just get better at aiming :) 




 I'm a simple man with simple tastes. Nothing beats an Old El Paso taco dinner kit. So, for restaurant tacos I like Moes and Chipotle, but if you are searching for "true" Mexican then look elsewhere.  




 I see the tree of life.

Conspiracy? 




 Agreed on the Browns game.

The first few games are scary. But...with this team, with so many being new and Philbin having their trust, if they won 3 of the first 4 games they would be a confident bunch, and that would make them dangerous. 




 So what you're saying is there's a chance? Nice! 




 What are the chances of the Mini (the NFC phone) coming with, or being available at an extra charge, in the US for the Max? 




 Let's get a list going of the places to sell domain names.

**sedo.com and afternic.com** are both marketplaces where you can sell domain names at retail. Escrow is available through these.

**namepros.com** is a domain name forum that has a section for sales; however, generally these are not end users purchasing, but other domainers, and so the price you'll get will be at a step discount. Note that the buy/sell process is outside of the forum so use escrow to protect yourself during the transaction.

**tobyclements.com** is a broker who deals with premium domains. He handles the transaction and takes 20%. You send him names that you are interested in selling along with your asking price (he'll reject if you don't include a price) and he uses his network to help sell. Often these are not end users, so you may not get top-dollar, but he does work with companies or individuals who will be end-users who are looking for the right domain.

**ebay.com** is really hit-or-miss for domains. Your listing would have to be viewed by someone interested in that industry/niche specifically. It is possible to sell on ebay, and many domainers have, but there seems to be quite a bit of luck involved. 




 Hi redditors!

I have taken over r/domainnames and would like to know what you would like to see from this subreddit.

I'm open to ideas, but a few of mine are below:
* Industry news.
* Premium names for sale (keyword-rich .com, .net, .org). I don't want this to get spammy, so possibly these go to a moderation queue if that's possible (I'll look into).
* Questions on domaining as a hobby or business.
* Success stories, case studies.
* Domain names   SEO

I've been dabbling in domain name buying/selling for many years and so can help others, though I'd like to see more users here to assist each other. I also have a lot of experience in SEO, and so can answer questions that pertain to domains in relation to that discipline.

Domaining can be really fun. Finding that diamond either not registered or about to be released and flipping is a lot like real estate with many of the same principles applying.

 Yeah!

Thanks :) 




 Jesus! 22lb cat on your back in a bar, are you sure you don't want to make the front page? 




 Cat in a backpack sounds like instant karma. 

Could do a bar that's in a restaurant, like vt pub   brewery.  




 There was one a couple of months ago, and yes it's allowed :)  I'm up for another.

This time I say we make a rule that no drifters with backpacks full of rotisserie chicken are allowed! Not that he wasn't a nice guy... 




 Reposts. Get over it. 




 The narc is watching this reddit closely. It's down already. 




 Twice on Tuesdays.  




 Same with Super Bowl wins. This is the ultimate team sport, it takes more than a QB to win it.  




 I lump them together. My understanding is how they respond is a part of the director AI. If not my bad. 




 I think it's terrible. Playing single player, or online with a bot on your team, is horrible. In fact I'd say single player is not worth playing on the hardest setting because of how bad the AI is. I've literally lay dying on the ground with the bots standing around me doing nothing at all, not even picking me up. 

I just consider them extra health packs, they aren't worth anything more. 




 I can't be of any help...but this brought back some nostalgia. I played this in high school and college. So much fun! I'd put in dark movie soundtracks and turn off the lights. Those were the days! 




 If you don't mind, please report back on your choice and outcome. I may be moving to Winooski and was wondering the same thing.

Fairpoint sucks where I am now, rumor is that there are places where Fairpoint isn't bad, and considering there's a Fairpoint building right in Winooski I had hopes... 




 Thanks.

Sorry for not  posting specs, but really wasn't about that as much as if it could even be upgraded. I've bought desktops in the past that were just impossible to upgrade. 




 I need a good starting point for a desktop pc (some gaming) but want to make sure it's one that I can upgrade later (graphics card, processor, for example).

Any one know if the ASUS M51 can be upgraded easily?

Thanks. 




 Am I the only one old enough to remember the generic store brand products like this 30 years ago?

 




 Subreddits...get your mind out of the gutter.  




 I'll show you mine if you show me yours. 




 Literally faster to use Sprint 3g, which is the laughing stock of mobile data.

 We don't have kiosks to purchase tickets (that I know of) up here.

Glad to hear it's working for you. When my finances are more settled I may subscribe. 




 That's generous of you. I've done that on their website, but it's unclear if they only look for theaters that take Discover, or if they've somehow confirmed their card is accepted.

My zip is 05401 though. 




 But whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy?
