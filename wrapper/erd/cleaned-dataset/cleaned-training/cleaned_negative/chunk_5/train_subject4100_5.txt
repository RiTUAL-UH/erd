 [Here's the link](http://society6.com/Maazcon/Chemistry-Hjg_Print#1=2) to it! I just set it up on my society6 account. 




 WAIT IT'S MY CAKE DAY?

oh^and^thank^you.. 




 I turned it into the two BrBa subreddits I visit most frequently. It's awesome to hear you saw that post too. Thank you! 




 Thank you. I want to see how it looks, by the way! 




 That puts my mind to a lot of rest. I've been obsessed with Yoji Shinkawa. He's the kind of artist i don't think anyone can ever accurately emulate. I feel lucky even to be close enough to give him a subtle homage.  




 **EDIT 2:** [Here's a link to my Society6 account](http://society6.com/Maazcon/Chemistry-Hjg_Print#1=2) for those that want to purchase it. I updated the work so it doesn't have my artist info anymore. I'm still looking for a vendor through where I can hopefully make it more affordable for you guys, so if anyone knows of a good one, let me know! Don't hesitate to send me a message if you have any questions about purchases either. If you guys just want to check out some more stuff I tend to post online, [here's my portfolio](http://mconpictures.com)

**EDIT:** I'm still not really awake at the moment because of the all-nighter I just pulled earlier, so this might all come out a bit weird. This is the first time that one of my artworks has gotten this much recognition and feedback, so I'm still in a phase of "HOLY SHIT" right now. 

I know that r/breakingbad implemented rules for artwork to be diverted to another subreddit. Since the mods do say they "may make an exception" for certain works, I wanted to take a shot at it, but this is honestly more than I could have asked for. 

For those of you asking about purchasing it, I want to try making that doable. I'll try having something set up by the end of today. I want to make sure it's in a good enough quality to be printed first, so I'm going to work on sorting that out. I do have a society6 account, but if anyone knows of another similar way to sell artwork online, let me know. I like society6, but I don't know how I feel about the prices. I want you guys to be able to buy it affordably, so I'll take the best route I can find to do that.

Seriously, the fact that there's people out there that want to own something I worked on myself is still something I'm trying to comprehend. Thanks again, everyone.


**Original post:** Yo, guys. I don't know how to say it, but thank you for the response to this, the criticism, everything. I uploaded this after finishing a 10 page essay and this is insane to wake up to after a sad attempt at two hours of sleep before class. I just keep refreshing the page right now because I honestly didn't think this would be getting hits or generating discussion at all that quickly. 


I promise i'll be responding to each one of you personally when i get out of class because you guys made my morning a lot less stressful. I feel too grateful. Thanks for all the feedback!



 




 The bulk of this was drawing Walter digitally.  I had renditions done first of him in every form of appeareance he took on. What ended up in this was mainly full on Heisenberg and Mr. Lambert. The coloration came afterward, and then I messed around (and perhaps got carried away) with layering it and distorting it from different angles. I've been obsessing over Metal Gear Solid artwork for a while now, so this got my graphic novel/cyberpunk inspiration running wild. 


Thank you so much, by the way! 














 Calm down, guys. Let's not start any treble here.  









 This all seems like it's about to come down to a conflict between Jesse, Hank, and Walter. I think the [painting](http://i.imgur.com/LAOANQ1.png) at Hank's house is about to show significance. 




 This is absolutely heartbreaking. 




 guys its the internet 









 If the CGI looks even just as good as it does here, I'll be sold on this approach to the big guy. It's a difficult task finding a way to bring the iconic "man in suit" look Godzilla's had for over 50 years, and working it into a movie that has to appeal to audiences in an age of high-budget sci-fi films focused mostly on computer generated VFX. 




 I'm 21, so I'm only a student right now. But besides my parents, our entire extended family lives overseas, so I get to visit places near in and near the Middle East every three years or so. This was my first time visiting Saudi Arabia, however.


Honestly, I'm incredibly lucky and fortunate to even have the chance to visit those places. I'm thankful that I get to see my cousins as often as I get to. 




 Mecca. In Saudi Arabia. It's connected to a hotel and directly faces Masjid Al-Haram, which is known as the holiest Islamic landmark in the world. 




 Yes sir. '05. 




 It'd be awesome if you guys put up screenshots of what they look like on your phone, by the way. I love the fact that other people out there like my work enough to want to keep it as a background. I'll have more for you guys soon! 




 Right on! Took it from a parking garage near the Riverwalk.  




 Got it taken care of. That picture was from a month or so back. I put together a new one just to ease everyone's mind, hah


...except for the SRS light. That's next week.

 I do! The handle is @maazcon.  




 This is pretty much a subreddit for all mobile wallpapers. Not just iPhones. 




 As a PSA for everyone, get your hands on VSCO Cam right now if you can as well. They're giving it for free because of a new update, and they have a promotional cut from $16 to $6 going on for their entire IAP bundle. It's worth shelling out the money for. The best results for me came from that app. Afterlight's been my go to editing app for a long time as well. Both are awesome.


Glad to hear they look good so far! I'm on a jailbreak and waiting for the OS to be finalized before I get it, so I was a bit nervous about how the pictures would look on iOS 7. I can't wait to see how they came out on the parallax. 




 I don't mind at all! You can use my twitter handle if you'd like. @drcon 




 If you're losing interest in your own work, then you know you've been staring at them too long on your own by now. You don't even really need Reddit to start with. Show them to close friends. Post them on your social networking profiles. Feedback from good friends, family and anyone around you is a big step forward. 

Making a website to build a portfolio out of them once you've really learned a few techniques and have a few sets of photos to work off of comes later on. Post them to reddit for feedback and criticism, whereever appropriate.

[r/photography](http://reddit.com/r/photography) has some great links to tips and guides on building on your work, if you want to check it out. 




 Thank you guys tremendously for the feedback. I'm glad to know that these were pretty well received. I'll try putting together another set in the coming few weeks! 




 Sure thing, man! This isn't really iPhone sized, but it is my favorite shot I've taken of the skyline. Let me know if you want me to size it for an iPhone.

 I mainly use Afterlight and VSCO Cam.

Afterlight is great too, if you want a fast, clean, and cheap editing program. It works great with Instragram. 




 I take them because I like taking them. I tried doing photography as a job, but then it just made me hate it so I stopped. Now I just carry my phone with me and capture anything I find worth shooting, and i love it. It becomes an addiction when you know you don't need an SLR to make something cool every day.


Also for karma. 

*..Kidding(?)* 




 14 was a worm's eye view of the inside of a dome of Masjid al-Nabawi in Medina. I had the opportunity to see it while I was in Saudi Arabia. It's one of the most beautiful places I've ever been to. 




 [2](http://i.imgur.com/h5in1HU.png), [5](http://i.imgur.com/BLQGnLQ.jpg), and [23](http://i.imgur.com/nLsniSk.jpg) are of downtown Dubai. The one of the building was right next to the Burj Khalifa.

[10](http://i.imgur.com/Yq8bsFS.jpg) and 12-18 were taken in Saudi Arabia. I was there last March. Some of the pictures in the album are of Masjid al-Nabawi and al-Haram, from the inside and outside. If you see the b w shot of the man walking under large umbrellas, those are put out there to keep people under the shade outside the mosque. It's amazing to see. The pictures don't do those places justice.

The shot of the [mountains](http://i.imgur.com/8eGiIvah.jpg) was taken in switzerland, somewhere in the alps. The rest were a collection of shots from Austin, San Antonio, and Dallas. Dallas is where I currently live. I'm really glad you guys like these. I'll make sure I post more soon!
 




 Mostly the default camera. A few were shot with Camera+, and I touched them up using VSCO Cam and Afterlight. 









 Anytime! Here's my [website](http://mconpictures.com) if you want to check out some more work I do. :) 




 If there's one thing that Dallas has taught me, though, it's that you can find a good shot in anything you see around you. Even home. Keep a sharp eye out for what you find beauty out there and the pictures you take will follow your cue. And thank you, I really appreciate that, my friend!

 A Series of Unfortunate events.

 Upvotes. Upvotes for everybody. 




 You must be a blast at parties. 









 This song has such a sick beat. I really do think *A Thousand Suns* gets too overlooked. It's their best album, in my opinion. 




 I thought it'd have been said by now, but **Recovery** by Eminem. 

No moping, no self-loathing; just all out "I'm getting back where I should be" kinda feel when I listen to it. And 25 to Life was genius. 




 I made a mistake in the title: this is the oldest established university that's *still in continuous operation,* not the oldest university in the history of ever. Sorry! 




 I checked before posting it. That thread wasn't showing up in the [search results](http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcollegestats.org%2Farticles%2F2009%2F12%2Ftop-10-oldest-universities-in-the-world-ancient-colleges%2F) when I looked the link up. 









 What phone? 




 AY-AHHHH 




 Jarvis: ONE *MORE* THING... 




 Guys, this is a repost of a picture I put up from my friend's facebook. This isn't the 101. It's in Jordan. The original is somewhere in my submissions. 




 I'm the original OP of the photo. It was indeed from my friend in Jordan. 




 Lost in the Echo... such a sick opening song. 




 Thanks for the feedback. It's definitely not perfect by a long shot, but it was really fun to work like this for the first time in a while! Hopefully I'll get to show you guys something awesome on here really soon; this time not in just a night's worth of work..
