 Pssst, patent this. 









 Sure. Anything in particular you want to see?

For a second I considered asking what about a neutrally-labeled picture of an overworked underage girl in wartime screams "Soviet propaganda" at you, but nevermind, I might be better not looking into that void. 












































 Hi! I'd like to introduce our new, free app [Mother To Be] (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mother-to-be-app/id962704086?mt=8). The title makes it clear enough that's a rather niche application intended for those going though pregnancy. Basically, it's an interactive calender that allows to keep track of various parameters (weight, diet habits, sleep patterns) and make notes - a personal journal of sorts.
We're very fond of the concept and would appreciate feedback, especially from the target audience. Please tell what you think is lacking and which features you found redundant. 









 Got it all over himself, yeah. None ingested thankfully.
