 I appreciate and generally agree with your position BossOfTheGame, but *you're* the one taking "be a man" out of context here. Ardenfrost was using it in while specifically addressing the gendered father-daughter relationship, so his use of the gendered "Man" is appropriate. He isn't ignoring cultural influence on gender perception, he's responding to it--I can't help but wonder if you even read the comment.

Beyond gender, "Man" implies adulthood, which is essentially at the root of Ardenfrost's statement. There could be and have been countless similar meditations on how motherhood informs womanhood; that's actually a topic that informs large segments of feminist theory.

On a personal note, BossOfTheGame, your baseless insinuation that nmoyer12 and Ardentfrost are willfully ignoring some hidden socio-structural truth that only brooding philosophers like you are privy to makes you sound like a pompous ass. I don't know you, you're probably nice, but that's just how it reads. 




 Ah, cool. Chalk it up to semiotic providence then. 




 I've noticed that companies like Google and Microsoft have been spending  pretty big advertising money on pushing their respective browsers. What's in it financially for them? They don't have any ads that I can see, so do they make money on extension licencing or something? Are browsing histories being monitored or monetized? Is it just a ploy to get people to accidentally use Bing? 




 it is the kind of dumb shit that a worked up school board could flip out over, though. 




 And a pen! Don't forget the pen! 




 It does occupy a very interesting space. Even the title has a touch of race consciousness to it: taken on its own, white castle sounds a bit like caucasion paradise or Anglo estates or something; appropriate, as the two minority characters navigate white-dominated American culture. Call it a coincidence, but given the facts that the rest of the film *is* visibly race-conscious and that they could have easily chosen any other restaurant, I do think there is a deliberate political statement in there. 




 I'm sorry that you feel that way, takeheed. If it helps, my point was not that anyone was downvoting because they disagree with you, but that we likely already accept the expressed opinion as established fact to the extent that it doesn't really add much to the conversation to reiterate it. 




 **Observe and Report**: while many wrote it off as a Paul Blart Mall Cop copycat, the movie is a pitch black satire that owes more to Taxi Driver than Happy Madison. A lot of movies glorify delusional underdog ambition, conflict resolution through violence, and shallow sex objects as love interests. Observe and Report renders those typically unchallenged values entirely pathetic, absurd, disturbing, and hilarious. You may need a fairly dark sense of humor to appreciate it, however: I was literally the only person laughing in my theater. 




 Not to be a dick, but I doubt that you're going to blow any minds in TrueFilm by saying that Hollywood is generally shallow. 




 Well, that's completely made up, but whatever floats your boat. 




 MDC is a perfect example of the complete *opposite*: they employ strong language to assault those in power, *not* to pile on the oppressed.

My problem is not and has never been this fey "ooh a bad word" shit I seem to be accused of; the fact is that these words, in this order, in this context express and promote, at best, ignorance, and at worst, bigotry. 




 Yeah, I'm aware of the AIDS crisis, thanks. Leaving my panties out of the equation, an artist has a uniquely privileged voice. They can use that voice to stick it to anyone they want. In this song, Axl Rose used his voice to stick it to the mistrusted and downtrodden, the disenfranchised, the *literally dying and beaten minorities* around him. I never knew about it, I shared it, I think it's interesting in its own unfortunate way--I come down on the side of "Fuck him then," but other than that, it ain't that deep. 




 Axl Rose has every right to express his frustration in any form he chooses, but if his most artful songwriting strategy is to rail against "niggers, immigrants, and faggots," then that's ridiculous and pointlessly hateful and fuck him, personally.

In [responding to the song's controversy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_in_a_Million_\(Guns_N%27_Roses_song\)#Controversy), Rose stated that his "pro-heterosexual" stance (his term) was based on "bad experiences" with gay men--in that light, his claim that "faggots [...] spread some filthy disease" appears to be based on hateful generalization, which is literally exactly what bigotry is. He has since gone on the record listing a handful of gay or bisexual individuals who he admires, and good for him if his position has evolved, but that neither explains nor excuses the song.

On his use of the word "nigger," Rose has paradoxically claimed that nigger doesn't mean black (bullshit) and later that he was only referring specific black people who were trying to rob him (more bullshit). I charitably suspect that he's a bit of an idiot 




 Explain. 




 By that standard, literally every idiotic thing ever expressed is art simply by virtue of its genesis in real life. That doesn't make this song commendable, effective, or good in any sense.

Personally, I'd prefer that nigger and faggot *weren't* casually tossed around all the time, but that doesn't mean I support censoring the words from artistic usage. I simply think that as used in this song, they express and encourage self-righteous ignorance. Art or not, I'm hardly a simpleton for calling that bigotry. 




 Immigrants and faggots 

They make no sense to me 

They come to our country 

And think they'll do as they please 

Like start some mini Iran, 

Or spread some fuckin' disease

[...]

You're one in a million

Yeah that's what you are

You're one in a million, babe 

You're a shooting star! 

No, Axl Rose doesn't know what art is. This is not Ulysses, this is not Piss Christ, it's not even Woman is the Nigger of the World.  It's just a shitty song laced with some truly unfortunate ignorance. 




 Sure, but art has meaning. These words are being used with no artistic purpose beyond anger. 




 The words are "niggers" and "faggots." Up to speed? 




 Racism at [1:05](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DavdKjepuQg#t=1m5s), xenophobia and homophobia at [2:14](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DavdKjepuQg#t=2m14s).

Definitely sullies Sweet Child of Mine a bit for me. 




 Huh, I guess that's [another TIL.](http://www.heretodaygonetohell.com/articles/showarticle.php?articleid=56) To be fair, people today have a much better understanding of homosexuality than I'm sure Axl Rose did at the time, but that doesn't change the fact that it's a fairly nasty and indignant song that deliberately marginalizes minority "Others" in broad strokes. 









 I'm considering using a selection from Rhapsody in Blue for a film I'm working on, abut I'm having a hard time figuring out who owns the rights and how far they extend. Composed in 1924, it's a public domain piece almost everywhere in the world except the United States. It has some kind of copyright extension here, but I'm not sure if that applies to specific orchestrations or all variations generally.

Ideally, I'd like to arrange and record my own version of the piece. Does anyone have any experience or resources on the issue? 




 Not exactly, but they may be able to fake it. The "film feel" isn't so much about literal frame rate as shutter speed and motion blur--simply halving the number of frames won't fix that. It's certainly possible that they can digitally *synthesize* the film feel, but that would be an added special effect rather than a recovery per se. 




 Credit where it's due: "Walking Away" is certainly a classier title than "I took a picture of a hot chick's ass!" 




 what? no it isn't. it's literally the weakest evidence possible. 




 The weirdest part was the people calling him pathetic for caring too much about karma. If unearned karma moves you to rage, you're the one who's weirdly invested. 




 cool! I'm considering an eventual torrent release for an indie that I'm working on, too. What sort of distribution have you had up to this point? Any festivals or streaming? 




 So... why is this okay? 




 Is it just me, or is this a really smooth version of the verse from "Born This Way?" 




 What the hell does that have to do with indogofriday's grandpa's funeral? 




 using logic *is* the same is fundamentally rationalist. that's [exactly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationalism#Background) what it is. 




 yes I am. Wikipedia on epistemological rationalism: "any view appealing to reason as a source of knowledge or justification". I said rational, I meant rationalist, apologies if that was confusing.

Science draws on rationalist components like mathematics, adds empirical experimentation, and spits out rationalist generalization. Empiricism is part of it, but rationalism is too. 




 Correct. The scientific process draws on empiricism *and* rationalism. 




 Science certainly draws on Mathematics though, and the process of generalization is an equally Rational pursuit. To claim that science eschews rationalism is patently absurd. 




 Agreed. And that's one of many reasons why it's stupid to dismissively characterize scientists as exclusively empiricist. 




 yeah, lobaroja85, about that... 




 went down as soon as I finished watching it. I feel kind of special now. 














 Also, that it's fascinatingly terrible in every way. 









 Ha! Caught her being a lovely person! 




 Because the guy who's super dedicated to getting longest road almost never wins--better to let him just fizzle out on his own. 




 I'm quite partial to his work on [the Lion King](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxlSv97uljM feature=related), personally. 




 What are you doing? Genuinely curious. 




 The joke would be that *they* thought the interview went very well, while Hannibal Buress is actively ripping on them in his latest special. 




 I was hoping you'd link to the [Daily Eastern News](http://thelaughbutton.com/news/college-newspaper-responds-joke-hannibal-buress-special/#.T8VUzNVYv8k) article. 




 It's a bit porny for my taste, but it's a nice community regardless. 




 Electricity! 




 Tubthumping on loop just sounds awesome. 




 It seems like it might be less of a hassle to just find a decent Gerard Butler imitator and use a sound-alike. The recording is copyrighted, but the word and inflection are not. 




 Yeah, I'm familiar with what the term is supposed to mean. I just mean that the community is pretty hostile to *allegations* of white knighting, and generally rightly so. Where some people (sometimes fairly) see immaturity in the perceived lady honor defending, it generally seems like the white knight accusers are part of a far more troubling and idiotic wave of nerdy misogyny. "What? You want me to stop making fun of this chubby fourteen-year-old posing at comic con? Pfft whatever White Knight, I didn't know she was your girlfriend." No. Fuck that. If someone is being patronizing in their defense of somebody's honor or whatnot, then call them on it. "White Knight" brings nothing to the conversation.

I take umbrage with the suggestion that the term "white knighting" is somehow integral to Reddit overall. Reddit isn't full of "white knights," nor is it full of people who oppose "white nights;" it is, in my tiny little experience, full of people who think the phrase is idiotic and downvote accordingly.

None of which is to say anything about you personally, Gareth--I generally agree with most of the points you make. I have not, however, ever seen the simplistic reduction "white knight" used in a productive, insightful, or even particularly accurate way on this site. 




 Is white knight actually a Reddit thing? I've only ever seen the term invoked by idiots who are quickly downvoted. 




 The emoticon sells it. 









 It's a song about self-love and acceptance written at a time when racial turmoil was at the forefront of American culture. I wouldn't say it's specifically, exclusively about being black, but it certainly can be. 




 The correct response was, "I'll come back to this one." 




 Though your effort is appreciated, I know all that. I just hate playing in 4:3 letterbox, and would rather see games optimized for the ubiquitous 16:9 format ala the Super Mario Advance re-releases. Purely personal preference. 




 This is the number one reason why Virtual Console games do not receive my business. Also because I am broke. Tied for number one, I guess. 




 Duly humbled. :P

I wasn't really trying to initiate any dick-swinging, though--I know it's miles below what most people around here are used to, but it's a significant leap for me. Just wanted to share the feeling. :) 




 I would think that any mandatory life sentence for a non-heinous crime is neither reasonable nor ethical, but that's just my two cents. 




 One thing to consider is that the cocks will probably come out clean, whereas the fetuses could potentially be a bit soupy. If the cocks are too large or too dry, however, that might cause bleeding, so maybe soupy is better. 




 Wouldn't the fetuses be pretty draining, though? I mean, I'm a pretty staunchly pro-choice individual with a fairly unromantic view of fetal development, but I feel like wiping unborn fluids out of my ass-crack would really get to me after awhile.

Then again, massive cocks. 









 "I love you" over and over again. If all I have is five minutes of communication with [him](http://imgur.com/U7ngo), then what else matters? 




 1) Yes, you're right.

2) Fuck off. 




 Hmm. Basic tolerance of chubby comic fans having fun doesn't seem like that radical of a position to me, but whatever. 




 So yes, we can indeed confirm that it is a sign from the devil. 




 I don't dislike Nolan, though. I'm not a big fan of TDK or Inception, but I really dig The Prestige and Batman Begins for some reason.

You dislike his popular things and prefer his less widely appreciated things? Mysterious. 




 Interesting perspective; the need for an efficient cause seems like a modern take on the [Cosmological Argument](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_argument). Just to clarify, why is it assumed in this theory that God *does* preserve the cosmos? It's always been my understanding that the universe is [expected to collapse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_fate_of_the_universe) at some point. 




 Great to hear, I'm glad your faith brings you so much positive fulfillment! I'm intrigued by your description of God as "conscious"--acknowledging your proviso that it's based in personal experience, can you explain a little bit about what you mean by that? 




 I figured he was just making a pun on the term devil's advocate. I've never met a genuine theistic Satanist, personally. 




 Great, thoughtful response. It seems reasonable that any "God" would be something beyond human understanding.

My question, if I may: what happens to God when our understanding improves? If there is a definite God beyond the threshold of our comprehension, then it seems like perfect hypothetical understanding of the universe would prove its existence. And yet, for many people, knowing and comprehending a "formula" for all existence like you suggest would be the ultimate triumph of atheism, as there would be no higher power than that.

So: is it *conceivable* that God could exist once we have full knowledge of the universe, and if so, what would that God look like? If not, can God be said to exist at all? 




 Ah. 




 Fair enough, seems like a solid thing to believe in. Why do you personally choose the label "theist" for that though, if I may inquire? 




 No name-dropping, no book recommendations, just your own naked rationalization of faith. 




 That first conversation with Sovereign was one of my favorite game moments ever. The villain of Mass Effect 1 is Nietzsche's fucking void, it is a batshit version of the 2001 monolith, it is Solaris on crack. I don't care if Shepard lives or dies or if every question is answered or even whether any of my choices mattered in the end, but I would have liked to go down fighting something *that* thematically hardcore. 




 Do it! 









 It's been a couple years since I took PSY 101, but my memory of it is this: we spent a day or two on the history of psychology--ancient philosophical perspectives, Freud's popularization, the welcome switch to scientific methodology with behaviorism, the current cognitive revolution--and then spent the remainder of the semester learning about what we know and how we know it, because that's what you do in a science class. Freud had no evidence to support his claims, and thus had nothing to offer us beyond a single powerpoint slide on history day. Science classes are under no obligation to present every truth claim as equally valid; that would be terrible terrible terrible terrible science.

As for the word science, you're willfully using an antiquated definition. For those of us speaking in post-Aristotelian terms, the scientific method is, via [Oxford](http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/scientific%2Bmethod?q=scientific+method), "a method of procedure that has characterized natural science since the 17th century, consisting in systematic observation, measurement, and experiment, and the formulation, testing, and modification of hypotheses." This does not apply to all pursuits of knowledge, but to the very specific pursuits of scientists. Freud lacked systematic experiments and testable hypotheses, therefore his work is not science.

With respect to post-modernism: you have never met a working scientist who feels legitimately threatened by it, and you never will. Post-modernism will keep on bloobly dooping through subjective truths and stoner woo bullshit until it fizzles out within the next academic trend cycle, and science will keep on exploring the cosmos, developing medicine, advancing technology, and studying real, fundamental truths about the universe and our place in it. Call me dogmatic--seriously! do it now!--but I'll make damn sure that my art, philosophy and ethics can coexist rationally with testable, rational scientific thought... you know, real life. 




 Well, first thing's first, you've accused me of distorting the past three times now, and it's simply never happened. I said Freud was influential. I have no history of or interest in obscuring that fact. But whatever his influence, he has no place in the science classroom.

As for your other claims, you seem to be mixing epistemology and science interchangeably. Epistemology is the study of truth, Science is a very specific pursuit of truth through testable hypotheses and rational extrapolation. Freud pursued truth through theory, scientists pursue truth through science, and I'm not weaseling any linguistic marginalization into the discussion by saying so--that's just how language works. I don't use the word science because it implies superior authority or anything, I use it when discussing the *specific* thing that science is. Freud, for better or worse, has no right to claim scientific authority if he doesn't participate in the stuff of what science is, and he didn't and he doesn't.

As for the whole Empiricism vs. Rationalism debate, that whole contrived conflict strikes me as perhaps the greatest hypocrisy in post-modern thought: while the post-modern kids claim to be breaking down unjust binaries and redressing linguistic marginalizations, they do so by turning *every damn conflict* into the same damn simplistic binary they think they're railing against--hell, the name "post-modernism" is a fucking antithetical. The fact is that whatever the Philosophy and English professors might think, there are not roving gangs of rationalists and empiricists attacking each other in the streets.

On the contrary, rationalism and empiricism work quite harmoniously together in, drumroll please, the scientific method! Science loves rationalism *and* empiricism! They're two great tastes that that go great together, and when you combine them in science, they have a 1:1 correlation with reality outside the classroom. That's far more than any abstract unprovable theory can claim. 




 If you think making shit up doesnt play a huge roll in science **today** then you should stay the fuck away from science, because you obviously cannot understand the role insight and intuition play in generating hypotheses

 .
Must be testable? Sorry, but you are trying to place your modern conception of science into the **past**, and that just reeks of bad historigraphy.

.

You seem to be the one mixing eras here, singdawg. All I said was that "science today," your term, needs to be testable; Freud's "making shit up" approach doesn't have quite the clear-cut legacy in modern thought that you were implying. If you're saying that Freud is/was a scientist by virtue of his era's lowered standards, then fine--I don't see how that matters outside of a history class, but whatever.

And if you want to put Freud in a history of thought class, then go for it. But if you want to put him in a science class, then you're promoting regressive, outdated pseudo-science. I don't really see a debate to be had there. 




 Freud was a highly influential theorist, but a scientific hypothesis must be testable, the end.  




 Wake up, Matthew. 




 Shit, an Elcor named Filbert sounds awesome. Not even joking, I'd take him with me on every mission. 




 One of the most masterful scenes in Jackass 3D. Love the [shot](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDz4Bs9UaAw) when the the dildo comes into the crazy narrow focus super slowly, and when you realize its a dildo it's away like a foot away from your face thanks to the stereoscopy. Fuck *Hugo*, that movie was hands down the biggest leap forward in cinema to come out of this 3D thing. 




 This is the epilogue I was waiting for. 




 Honestly, this is exactly what was *right* about the endings for me. Mass Effect has never been about making you a messiah; at its core it's been about [making tough sacrifices from day one.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcM4VPdke8o) The original game was defined by no-win choices like Kaiden or Ashley, human lives or the council... Mass Effect presents a world where victory only comes with a tinge of guilt and regret, and it's all the more resonant for that.

The fact that the Normandy wigs out and no repercussions are shown, however... I got nothing. DLC time! 









 ha! *gay*! 




 "I was going to write something. I forgot what it was. It felt important."

My twelve-year-old sister was talking about a facebook status when she said this, but it completely captured the creative funk I was in at the time. 




 I'd just like to chime in that on a purely aesthetic level, the monoliths occupy a two dimensional viewing space more often than not. Beyond their physical presence in the film, they take on the role of complete, inscrutable obstruction for the viewer, much like the mind might respond to knowledge that advanced. 




 Unless it's a documentary, every film has its own diegesis. Boondock Saints exists in a world where God Almighty demands street justice, untrained vigilantes are effective killers through mimicking bad television, and straight men are attracted to Willem Defoe in drag. This is not real life.

The fact that this movie and others exist in a clearly fictional world is what makes the vigilante action justice harmless and acceptable--most action movies do a far better job of justifying their killing, but whatever. The *only* reason that the paltry, unsupported criticism is included is for the purpose of taking the film's action diversion into the real world, and that's where it goes from fluff to message movie. 




 And if you made a movie with all sympathetic characters bashing gays, then portrayed it as a fifty fifty split public issue, it'd be just as backwards as this shit fucking movie. When you take a *fucking crazy backward position* and stage it on equal footing with its sane, rational antithesis, your lending backward bullshit legitimacy that it doesn't deserve. The real-life popularity of any issue is not and has never been my point. It's like when people say Obama is a Muslim: that is an *insane* position, and anyone who frames the issue as a one to one ratio controversy is elevating the batshittery undeservedly, whether consciously or not 




 Sure. The penguins are one-dimension characters written for the sole purpose of being punished, and the brothers *know* this because *God* tells them, so they are thus free to rape them all without due process. It's fine for a dumb movie, it's psychotic in real life, it's as crazy as ever to contextualize such actions as a legitimate arguable public position. What's your point? 




 I really liked the gay angle until they *did* make it part of the plot, sticking him in a dress and making him punchline. Unfortunate. 




 that has nothing to do with it. If somebody makes a movie about a bunch of heroic characters raping penguins, then ends in pseudo-documentary footage of a 50/50 split on the issue of penguin rape, then it's totally fair to attribute some sort of penguin raping agenda there. I don't know how many people are actually pro-murder *or* pro-penguin rape, but the fact that it's portrayed as an issue of public debate is clearly an attempt to lend the discussion some legitimacy. 




 The fact that the movie even thought there was a debate to be had was insane. In real life, killing strangers because God told you to is fucking nuts, the end. If everyone agrees with them--as every sympathetic character in the film to that point had--then it's a goofy fiction. When it's portrayed out of nowhere as some sort of controversial issue, it's clear that the film misguidedly thinks there's an argument to be had for killin' all the bad guys. 




 thanks, he's a goldendoodle! 









 $400 is actually pretty generous for a twelve-year-old's allowance.
