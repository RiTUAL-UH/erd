 Shit, someone stole my profile pic 




 gotta get there before the hair 




 He's really laid-back and charismatic. But primarily, he's just damn funny and has been since he was Knighted as Not So Grump 




 Yes. Yes he is 




 People don't have to be bound by something they said in the past. He could change his mind at any time. But yes, it would be great to see him on Grumpcade.

Maybe he and Dan will debut on Grumpcade with the same episode 




 Ne'er a truer word spoken! 




 Do you have Soundbooth? If you do, use the preset "Reduce Peaks" apply it, then use the preset "Everything The Same Level" and apply that.

The Grumps use something along those lines with their own preset in their audio program.  




 Coming this summer: "Anne Frank" starring Miley Cyrus! 




 thats the one! 




 lol, I believe there's a song on youtube about that 




 r/askreddit is the most curious little boy I've ever met! 




 There's r/funny being obnoxious again... god, someone needs to change his name... 




 my worst nightmare.... 




 Four Score and Seven Beers Ago, I realized I am lonely... I need someone to accompany me to the theater tonight. 




 (Executive) You can't use that scene idea for a SpecSaver ad! Put that idea in the rejected pile! 




 you already had me shaking it at "ice cold" 




 Cool harp! Do you know how to play "Iron Man?" 




 I like Arin the most. He's the funniest and he's clearly a caring and generous guy, considering he built this business using his popularity to give his friends employment, and to help them get their own popularity (I highly doubt Jontron or NSP would be doing well without their involvement with Egoraptor)

I think his comedy is better suited for what he's doing now, a twice a day, ten-minute show where he just improvises, making jokes about video-games, instead of his animations: an occasional 30-second to 1-minute short where he improvises, making jokes about video-games. I don't see all the hype about missing his animations. He's making the exact same jokes on Grumps he'd be making with his animations, he just doesn't have to take months to *animate* the jokes. And let's be honest, he's not exactly a good artist. Decent enough to make animations, but not good.

*Having that said*, I can't stand his opinions on most issues, and I think he has very bad analytical skills regarding video-games and movies. I also can't stand his whining (but I hate whining from anyone, even Dan and Jon.... but Arin does it the most)

And I think he handled the Jon fiasco the right way. If there was a bad-guy in the breakup, I'd think Jon was probably it. 




 But that perception is delusional. It was an official business when Jon was there.

It's impossible to be successful on Youtube unless you run it like a business. It is a job, after all, and Game Grumps was a business from day one 




 with a Kitchen Knife 




 Oh shit, have I been weeding out friends on facebook the wrong way? 




 Never knew there was a thing called Maker TV 




 I thought Disneyland moved to New York 




 Are Arin and DisneyLand still friends? 




 That was pretty damn clever! :D 




 But dude, there weren't even any jelly beans in that level 




 Thank you all for throwing this WONDERFUL baby shower!  The baby's dead, ANYWAY, who wants cake? 




 Dude, don't go that way. There's a big mine fiel-- (**BOOM**) 




 This summer! Adam Sandler and Andy Samberg star in... "The Host And The Parasite!"

Rated PG-13 




 You have money right? Yeah, you can afford liposuction 




 But they made chemotherapy sound so fun! 




 I feel like this scene prompt gets posted in some iteration almost on a weekly basis 




 Welcome back to the second season of Firefly! Which takes place in space, but the space part DOESN'T matter! 




 How many times have I told you... you put the cereal in **BEFORE** THE MILK!!! 




 I think you would feel that same emotional attachment to another form of entertainment that brings you joy, if you stopped watching Game Grumps. 




 I don't know why everyone thinks he's so bad at games. I mean, he did grab *ALL 30 JELLY BEANS* every single time! 




 I usually don't care, but there's only so many jokes Danny can make at the expense of Arin's failure before it gets boring. A whole episode of fuck-ups is fine, but not if it's the exact same fuck-up over and over again. Go to a different level and fuck-up there.

Plus, it's just super fucking annoying to hear Arin complain about a video-game. Ever. 




 Yeah, that works. Looked up a quick video 




 Ah. Makes sense 




 really? I have to try this real quick (*fuck* looking it up)


edit: It doesn't work 




 Eh, whatever happens 




 Umm... are you stupid or a troll? 




 Katy Perry's boobs 




 askreddit 




 Peeing on the homeless 




 The more you argue with an idiot on the internet, the stupider and more stubborn you make them 




 Darth 




 E-mail 




 That's what she said 




 Avocado Cadabra 




 Lara Croft. Besides the obvious sexual reasons, she also has a job that would bring home a good amount of money, and she'd be able to protect the house pretty damn well. I'd basically let her wear the pants of the relationship, which I'd be okay with because of those sweet, pointy ta-tas 




 Mostly being scared 




 I dunno... GOD, I hate questions like this! It just ruins my day! Jesus! Grrr! 




 Damn, Candice, I can see where you got that sweet ass..... your dad in those jeans is drivin' me wild! 




 You expect me to believe that? ...... are you THAT afraid of an ass-whoopin? 




 Ew! You sick perv! That's your great great great(x1000) grandmother! 




 lol, I think that was on Family Guy 




 Well, shucks! I've now been halfway turned into the last animal I touched! This is quite a predicament! 




 Story, Mario's hair color, A box that is without a beat, Ross's face, Food, Good Games 




 lol, I think each and every sin should end with "unless you want to" 




 You should put a parenthetical next to Ross like this:

Ross (Sometimes?) 




 They mostly play older Nintendo games that are basically an abandoned market. The primary reason is, Nintendo hasn't found the Grump videos or cared enough to flag them.

Plus, Maker Studios has a better understanding of the ins-and-outs of the legal issues presented here. I think they'd be confident enough to defend the Grumps in court if Nintendo tried to claim the revenue. 




 Send something to their twitters 




 I am Ganondorf! King of all Evil in the Land of Hyrule! I demand to know what's in the soup of the day! 




 What'd he do? Rape a bitch? Alright, feed him to the sharks. NEXT!

What'd she do?  Cheated on her taxes?  Alright, feed her to the sharks. NEXT!
 




 You better have my money by Thursday, you got it? If it aint in my hands by then, I'm gonna hook you up with a nice job with medical benefits that pays 35 dollars an hour so you can pay off your debt!

....trust me... you don't want it to go that far.. 




 I brought you a little something that'll warm your house.... it's a *fire!* 




 Robin! Quick! To the Batmobile! Mr. Slippy Fist is getting away! 




 I've noticed it. I kinda have that same behavior when my best friends talk about hanging out with other people 




 It was probably planned for it to be once Danny had a series longer than Sonic 06.

They probably only picked FireRed back up so that they wouldn't have to wait as long to reach that point. 




 Nice to see a fan that understands that the channel is more than just a show where people talk around video-games. It's a legitimate business that produces a product in an industry where you walk a fine line between being profitable and being bankrupt, entirely depending on how your audience perceives you.

You also have a fantastic grasp on the New Media industry.

Most people (especially on this sub) don't understand the decisions that Arin made about mentioning Jon and they think that: Jon disagreeing with Arin's decisions = Arin lied.

I think they handled the situation perfectly, and I think they let the right amount of time pass to cement the new era of Game Grumps in, so that they could discuss the old era without the potential to damage the show. 




 Happy Birthday..... Mr. President...... (seductive dancing) 




 Damn it! Nothing but white kids again... 




 Who wants Jack Daniels?  




 I liked Jon's part, lol. Like he was in exile. 




 We need Nostalgia Critic and Egoraptor playing a Simpsons game 




 Eh, Bloodborne's been pretty boring so far... but I wouldn't say it matters if it's Modern or not. They should just play what they feel like playing. 

I kinda prefer them fucking up a lot though. It reminds me that I'm not watching this show for the games 




 everybody do.... **The Barry Bump!**  (beatboxing begins) 




 If they turned off the music settings, sure.

It's an amazing game, too, I'd love to see them play it as it'd spark a lot of heavy metal music discussions. 




 Some of the things Arin has said about motivation, hard work, and etc. 




 Yes 




 I saved this country 2 billion dollars in debt by switching to Geico! 




 And the rockets red glaaare!  




 yeah, there's a demo somewhere.

it wasn't good 




 It's an actual project, not just a Let's Play. It takes time to produce, and they don't have a big post-production team. There's a lot of editing that needs to be done, which will be more complicated because they'll have to make sure it's coherent and actually tells a story (even if it is a Reality-Show-esque story) There seems to be a lot of live-action elements to it, and that's a lot harder to edit than game footage. There's a lot more to editing a real project than just putting clips in the correct order. Once the raw edit is done, it is immediately followed by Sound Mixing, Music, Color Correction, etc.  Each of which are difficult and time-consuming on their own.

They also have to balance this project with the other projects they're working on (some of which they probably haven't told the fans about yet) 




 Hey, Cyclops.... *Staring Contest?* 




 SERIOUSLY, JESUS!? Heroin!? In MY house!?  I knew being a hippie for 30 years would lead to this! 




 "Well, Mr. Johnson, you're hired! I think you're the best person for this position!" 

(Must....resist....) 




 pure evil! 

I'll take seven 




 You're my new hero
