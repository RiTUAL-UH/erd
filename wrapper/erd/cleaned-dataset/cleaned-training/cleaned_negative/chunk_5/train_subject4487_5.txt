 One thing I've done that works really well is to cut off the cat's paws. I recommend making the amputation at the metacarpophalangeal joint.

Afterwards, they don't really walk much, it's more of a sideways crawl, so they don't have much incentive to leave your property.

You might also consider fusing wheels onto their stumps so they can still skate around the house. If you have an RV pad you can turn that into a playground for them.  Climbing will be a challenge, though cats are pretty resourceful. 




 Without running the code on a machine, what do you think that it'll print? Justify your answer.
    
    ArrayProxy.prototype.computeSum = function() {  
        this.sum = 0;
        this.content.forEach(function(value) {
            this.sum += value;
        });
        return this.sum;
    }

    console.log(myArray.computeSum()) 

I can't justify executing code that someone can't be bothered to lint.

 I started my new Job as a Junior Web Developer this Monday, and so far its pretty good

It's only Thursday, bro.

The dilemma I have right now, is they program in many different languages with many different frameworks so there isnt a set in stone one to learn

Yep, jack of all trades, master of none.

My issue right now, is what I finished work I go home and have to do further programming to improve my Javascript skills, which does quite interfere with my social life

Yep.

meaning I do drift further away from friends

JavaScript is your only friend now.

as we often connect through playing Games together and skype, which I dont really have the time for now.

    if (life !== fair) {

I am wondering how you balance your time, while learning new skills/starting new jobs

It all depends on the life you want. Do you want to make good $ and never have a problem getting a job?  Then get used to this because it takes a lot of work to remain relevant, especially when working on the front-end.  It's literally a part time job just trying to keep up.

The Role is mainly front end based for now, but they are keen to get my trained up in back end.

Of course they are.

I'm assuming a US Postal Money Order is essentially being treated like a "bank" check/money order. Again, this was quick googling.

The woman told me she checked the mark that said it **wasn't suspicious**.

If it wasn't suspicious, why was a SAR filed?  It seems like if they thought you were structuring the $, they would have flagged it as suspicious?  Their actions seem a bit contradictory, though I don't know much about this stuff... 









 Why would you want to lint *after* you've committed? You want to catch these types of errors *before* you commit, otherwise your repo/history becomes cluttered with unnecessary errors which you might be rolling back into.

[Go out to the 1, 3 or 5 year view](http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/dxy)

We're going to hit 100 any day now. If the Fed raises rates, we'll be seeing more decline. I think there's a Fed meeting next week.

It might be a rough year for PMs. 




 I imagine that's covering the increased insurance costs.

To some extent, yes.

* $500 order is $12.95 shipping
* $1,000 order is $19.95 shipping
* $2,000 order is $29.95 shipping

Do you think that shipping difference is mostly the increased insurance cost? It seems a bit much to me.

 I've never had them take more than 2 business days.

Two business days for what?  To clear a check/ship or ship once the status changes from "on hold" to "confirmed payment"? 




 I've never had shipping time issues with them, though I don't have a big order history with Monarch.  My biggest gripe with them is their tiered shipping raping structure. I mean pricing structure. The more you buy, the more $ you pay in shipping, yet they use the same priority mail/flat rate box.  In other words, you may pay $20 shipping and get the same flat rate box a $450 order would come in. You've just paid 2x as much for shipping.

Provident has the "worst" shipping times, from my experience.  I always pay by check, so I get hit with the literal week of clearing time for that.  Then, after that clearing week, the order switches to "confirmed payment" where it can take another 2-3 days to actually ship out.

Another thing to note is my last order with them, my check actually posted/cleared my bank the day the check was received at Provident. This is according to tracking delivery date and the post date on my check via online banking.  Same friggin' day Provident receives my check, the $ is taken from my bank. Which, in this day and age, is really how it should be, yet clearing time seems stuck in decades past.

 Which is why it's always fun to listen to them.  Did any PM "expert" predict the crash over the past 3-4 years? If the experts have shit track records, there's no point in having experts.

I'd love to know what Mr. Morgan (and others like Mike Maloney) have personally done with silver over the past 3-4 years. 




 Your buddy needs a collar. 




 Personally, I can't say I'm seeing inventory issues.  What specific products have you been looking at and through which dealers? 




 Can't argue with that. 




 Really? Has he ever said to exit your position, get into cash and wait? When silver was in the 40s? 30s? 20s? 




 I'm moving everything I have into a new small business - hunter/killer kittens.

FACT: When the collapse comes, just like today, everyone will need to eat.

With one (or five, ask about bulk pricing) of my killer kittens, you'll never have to worry about food. 

What do you really want when the SHTF? Some Mercury dimes or a bag full of dead birds and mice?

Think about it. 




  Inventory is running out among a bunch of different online vendors

What do you base this on? 









 Correct, but he has to pimp the fact silver is "cheap" and the price of a coin is about the price of what it takes to mine it.  Sounds like a deal!

He doesn't explain what his metrics are, only mentioned First Majestic being around $14, then goes on to say conservatively cost is around $17. 









 I'd give them a week to respond, i.e., I wouldn't do anything with my credit card company until Thursday.  That's just me, though (and I'm an asshole). 




 In the 13s if the gold:silver ratio stays relatively the same. 




 Well, if the strength of the US Dollar continues through 2015-2016 and the Fed actually raises rates, PMs are going to drop.  If this case plays itself out, your pain will be compounded if you buy strictly bullion instead of semi-numismatic.

 *The Road* is a movie about total collapse of society, scavenging to survive, real "SHTF" mentality that does exists in the PM community. There's a certain amount of cross pollination between stackers and preppers, where you'll hear about SHTF, TEOTWAWKI (Shit Hits The Fan/The End Of The World As We Know It respectively).  A bit nutty, IMO, but to each their own.

Now, back to stacking ammo and downloading the *How to Field Dress Your Neighbor* manual. 




 Economic crisis and fail of the dollar does not mean gold and silver become the new medium of exchange. It just means the value of the dollar becomes less.
