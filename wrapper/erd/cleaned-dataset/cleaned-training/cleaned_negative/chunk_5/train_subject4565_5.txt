 Michael Laws. 




 Report this man. 




 Oscar Issac was fantastic in Sucker Punch - especially in the Extended Cut. His final scene features him trying to molest a lobotomised girl and not being satisfied because she isn't fighting back. His reaction is so fucking chilling. 




 You mean domestic poster. The international poster doesn't say May 1st because it comes out earlier. 




 Read each of them once ;) 




 It's *Mama, I just killed a man* not     
**MAMA**: *I just killed a man*. 




 The Catcher in the Rye. Basically, it's a book about trying as hard as you can to avoid seeing yourself as you really are.  




 You mean since 2012, considering Thor takes place immediately after IM2 and Cap 1 takes place in the 40s. 




 They were with Fallon on Late Night too. 




 Fun fact: Lindelof and Cuse pitched for a fifth season end date, but ABC made them stretch it out to six. 




 So, you're 32. Why are you wasting your own time with such a redundant comment at your age?  




 I guess IDNRC. Sorry :) 




 That still doesn't explain why I'm just a shy guy looking for a 2-ply Hefty bag to hold my-y-y-y-y-y-y love. 




 [Mate!](http://youtu.be/Vjn2JKrlkcU) 




 Thor-y of Ev...that's a terrible title, Empire. 




 Die Antwoord were comedians before they were musicians IIRC. They're characters, so I have no doubt it's another case of the fake Michael Cera difficulty stories surrounding AD Season 4. 




 Don't you mean she's....**Taken**?! 




 Plus not tagged as ALTERED. 




 Michael Emerson or Terry O'Quinn. 




 They could have thought of some more intriguing trailer dialogue than "This is awesome!" and "Sweet!" It will sound more realistic in the movie, but come on. Don't put people saying that in the trailer. It's obnoxious and a turn-off. 




 She doesn't write at all. She's a director. 




 That's perfect, justified opinion. Pretty rare in these discussions. 




 I was asking because I'm a diehard fan and I wanted someone to back up their ridiculous hyperbole with anything other than vague statements. These aren't examples. I know every episode inside and out. I grew up with this show, and can answer any of the "unanswered" questions people usually bring up. Could you try again with any more than the same old BS I'm so sick to death of? 




 S3 and S5 finales would be fantastic *cancelled show finales* and the Internet would have elevated Lost to Firefly levels of worship, plus it would have saved us from the internet hive-mind circlejerk over the series finale (which I personally loved, and thought redeemed a mostly average final season). 




 I ended up checking it out and *Why was there a polar bear?* and *what was that monster and is it a dinosaur?* are probably worse than people thinking they were dead the whole time. 









 Go see Kingsman: The Secret Service in theatres. You'd probably love it. 




 Could you give examples as to why there's no substance? 




 The thread right next to this is called "What TV show was a complete waste of time?"    
I'm afraid to go in there. 




 ...or they could have divided 1000 by 50 (=20) and estimated from there. 




 [Search and Destroy](http://youtu.be/EDNzQ3CXspU), of course. 




 Season 6 makes it pretty clear that they're choosing to tell a myth/legend, and they even go through the light/water semi-explanation of why the island moves, and how they explain MIB's camp building the donkey wheel to change the direction of the water/light mechanism.    
Plus you've got the constant hints to Egyptian mythology, and the fact that people teleport to Tunisia specifically, which is relatively close to Egypt, tells you that this is likely the original location of the Island's land mass before it was dislodged from space through whatever the hell kind of mythical Egyptian hogwash makes it work.     
What exactly happened for no logical (storytelling) reason? Everything happens to move the story along or build atmosphere. It may not be the most scientifically logical, but by the Season 5 finale they make it pretty damn clear it isn't supposed to be that type of story. 




 The title track from Kid A may well be the most emotionally draining song I've ever heard - it worms it's way into my head and leaves me depressed for the rest of the day after I listen to it.    
The album never made me shiver like Exit Music, or the payoff of Electioneering after Fitter Happier. It just left me shrugging and in a gloomy mood. The National Anthem, Optimistic, and Disappear will stay with me, but Everything, In Limbo and Idioteque became repetitive after several listens.    
The appeal of that album is something that can't be explained. I think it's just something that only certain people can *get*. I won't be one of them.    
But, The King of Limbs? Whaaaaa... 




 The execution of the guy with the rat in *The Green Mile* 




 Flux capacitor, the force, totally grounded in reality.  




 JJ Abrams left after one episode to make M:I3 and never came back. He has basically nothing to do with the show. 




 ITT: Premieres, not pilots. 




 What do you mean? This is when such riveting drama occurs as Sun losing her wedding ring, Michael ditching to go yell *WAAAAALLT*, Shannon being mad about not being taken seriously etc. These are such defining moments in the series /s 




 It's definitely not. 




 Best one I can think of is Stand By Me, and another great one where the first act is entirely about this: The Deer Hunter. Three hours long, so the first act is quite long. 




 The Governor says Liar as he kills Hershel. I was quoting the scene. 




 Alternatively:    
*She's not my daughter. I stole her as a baby from an insane woman. She means nothing to me. I'm not coming out of this house, so if you want to kill her, go ahead a-* 




 *Liar.* 




 Yeaaaaaah...Mary from Jasper, Alabama... 




 Didn't affect me because I'd seen the whole series, but the US S2 blu-ray begins with a full season 4 trailer, beginning with the line "We're really going home!". I had to import the blu-ray because it's not available anymore in NZ. 




 His monologue in the Season 5 finale is the best! And in episode 6.07. I like both Evil Ben and Conflicted Ben just as much as each other. 




 Game of Thrones would be so much better if they were the same ages as in the books. 




 Fun fact: The only episode after that to end with a non-Giacchino music montage is 2.19: S.O.S. 25/26 episodes later.    
Alternatively, [here's my personal favourite LOST ending](http://youtu.be/YdPwvglZSP8). From 3.08: *Flashes Before Your Eyes*. **MASSIVE SPOILERS** 




 They've seen it loeds. 




 And about the reaper storyline. These are apocalypse games, so they should be apocalypse movies. ME has rich lore and great history, but the reason I love these games is because of the characters and the Normandy crew. I want to see Sovereign and Harbinger on a massive screen!     
    
EDIT: I mean compared to creating an original story in this universe, which is what is always suggested in these kinds of threads. 




 Peacewalker came out after 4, so I'm planning on playing it after 4 and before Ground Zeroes. Am I doing it right? 




 It's not just on Conan's videos. The comments are botted to get hundreds of fake likes. The likes aren't real, most of the comments aren't real. Don't believe that stuff :) 




 'UGC Expert' on inFamous 2. Because of this, I deleted all of my save data and spent two hours one morning, close to 10 months after I gave up, marathoning 25 straight user-generated missions as soon as I unlocked them again.    
Trophies take so long to pop in the first two inFamous games that if you turn your console off 10 seconds into what could be a 30 second wait, it cancels the trophy. Pretty bad. 




 How to best structure a Mass Effect movie. I highly disagree that it should be an original story in that universe. Mass Effect are apocalypse games, so they should be apocalypse movies.    
    
I also think Shepard should die on Virmire. 




 Or New Zealand for a couple of hours earlier. 




 No, that was just the name of the episode. 




 Just like when they confirmed The Division for 2014. 




 I'm calling it: Bruce or Alfred becomes the Joker. 




 Just got back from seeing it, and that scene seems more inspired by The Raid 1. 




 Have you been reading YouTube comments lately? I've seen this "news" too. It's a scam. 




 I watched the first 30 or so minutes on YouTube and the whole thing was a bit drab for the week I was having, so I stopped.     
Eddie Redmayne played a good southerner, though. 




 The awkwardly straightforward direction, the overuse of Halle Berry, the early brutal killing of a main character for contractual reasons, the difference in pacing from the other movies, the tone shift from gritty and restrained to lighthearted and super cheesy were enough reason for me to actively dislike it for basically the entire runtime. I'm not even a comic book reader; it was a terrible sequel from beginning to end. Whenever Jean does anything tragic, it's too silly to take seriously. Calling it "The Last Stand" and hinting towards undoing both Magneto being cured and Xavier being killed - what was the point of that? 




 Because they both had one fight scene each... 




 I definitely don't *love* Whiplash, but I *really like* it enough to pester casual moviegoers I know IRL to watch it.    
     
It seems like the kind of film that would get someone more into film. That's what Shawshank was for me, and I'd bet money that Whiplash will be that movie for many people. It's accessible for the general public, but just artsy enough to convince some people that they're missing out. 




 After bi-yearly releases for the first three books, people had to wait 11 years to hear the rest of Tyrion's (etc.) story. While of course George isn't getting any younger, neither are the fans. There are probably many fans who died waiting. A Storm of Swords was 1100+ pages long, and it took two years to write. I'm not saying that it justifies people getting angry, but apologisers should acknowledge it's a massive annoyance. 




 Don't listen to Jay and Jack's rewatches, though. They're on their second rewatch and both sets spoil absolutely everything.     
Just saying. 




 He never edited himself out of DT. He edited the first book a lot, but only the first. 




 You're right. He's like Beth from Walking Dead - 29 year old actress playing 19, but you'd never notice. It's still uncomfortable for those who know. 




 Tobey - 39     
Andrew Garfield - 31    
They're both pretty fucking old. Keep them the hell out, is my advice to Marvel/Sony. 




 Holy shit, Jude Law would have been great in The Prestige. 




 Agents of SHIELD did that with Lucy Lawless in the S2 premiere. 




 The movie was manipulative enough. Turing was a revolutionary, and no one deserves what the UK government did to him...but the movie tries too hard to turn him into an underdog with a social disorder, which from what I've read, is bullshit through and through. 




 Those last few episodes of Season 3, though. The big moment in The Brig (3.19) where Cooper says "...Tom Sawyer." That's one of the moments I'd like to rewatch with no memory. It's hardly ever mentioned, but I say it's one of the best episodes of the series; and that revelation is insanely good.     
You ever been to Jasper? 




 /r/quityourbullshit is all about shaming people for lying on the Internet; and the comments for every post is a ton of "what pathetic fucking losers these people are amirite?" It's embarrassing when much of the time, people don't notice that the *evidence* clearly doesn't contradict the "bullshitter's" claim, but the post still gets really popular. Also, when someone's post is a permalink to another Reddit comment, it usually leads to thousands of negative karma points for the "bullshitter", whether they deserve it or not. It's pretty bad.  




 Trust me, I wouldn't praise the film if I didn't watch the legit cut. It's more like I don't really care to see the original, and this might spark my interest. I know how it ends, too, so that doesn't bother me. 




 Fan, I gather? 




 I think this will be my first viewing of Man of Steel. Hearing about how bloated it feels is exactly why I've never bothered. This sounds way more appealing. I'll look for it when it's posted to FanEdit.org 




 That was for a scene in the S1 finale, which was ensemble-centric. 




 Even more:     
*TVLINE | Do you know why the decision was made to kill her now?
Honestly, I feel like its story-driven. It does propel the story forward The [second half of Season 3] was a bit of a free-for-all. It had an organic fluidity to it and it just naturally unfolded day-by-day, week-by-week, moment-to-moment.*     
I don't think an actress over 40 would want to walk out on a consistent role in one of the most popular TV shows in the world.     
Many of them walked out because of a loyalty to Darabont, but she needed the role more than they did. Bernthal had been cast in a Scorsese movie. 




 You're making assumptions based on nothing.    
TVLINE | How long have you known about Andreas death?     
Laurie Holden: I didnt get the official word until a few days before we began [shooting] the finale. It was a shock to everyone. It was never part of the original story docs for Season 3. And it was rather unexpected. That said, this is The Walking Dead. This show is not conventional by any means  and we know that as actors going in. So you roll with it. You show up, you do the best job you can, and you honor the storytelling. Overall, this has been an extraordinary experience and I just feel so blessed to have been a part of it. 




 My number 5 as well! 




 (In DNA, if you press the action button while seeing how many *total* feathers you've collected, it tells you how many you've found out of how many there are in each district of any city. I didn't realise until I'd nearly finished). 




 Walking Dead Season 3. The season is spent building up to a confrontation, and it all just fizzles out. A character whose writing was heavily criticised was killed off simply because she was unpopular.     
But...for some reason we're supposed to care that she dies? The whole reason she's being done off with is because she's unpopular, *so why would killing her off and ending the season on that note* seem impactful for anyone?      
      
**EDIT**: [for anyone who thinks I'm making assumptions](http://tvline.com/2013/03/31/the-walking-dead-andrea-dies-laurie-holden-interview-season-3/) 




 That's a great way of looking at it. My initial reaction was basically "...that's what this was all building up to?" 




 The storytelling was great up to a point. Just...if you haven't yet, please refrain from watching the final cutscene of the Origins Easter egg mission. It's insulting. 




 ...and it's Romeo from Home and Away. 




 First time the studio logo is shown after the movie begins, which has only been done in IM3 and Guardians. 




 Who else knew him as Romeo from Home and Away? 




 Beyond doubt! 




 The *Once Were Warriors* sequel, if anyone was wondering.  




 Or *in* NZ since at least 2008. 




 No young Meryl Streep, and missing almost all of Keira Knightley's best. The wealth of Witherspoon and Cotillard content got my hopes up! 




 One Flew Over the Cuckoo's nest. McMurphy is supposed to be a ginger, but I kept seeing Jack Nicholson. 




 The LEGO Movie. Seeing the look on Will Ferrell's face when his son tells him about the adventure he's created with his father's LEGO collection. It's heartbreaking. 




 For me, it was when Percy tells the hick dude the truth about the mouse. When he reaches for the sponge and you see it's bone dry, my sobbing and quiets "no"s turned into a furious cry of "you're a sick fucking asshole!"    
Stephen King's drama is better than his horror IMO.  




 Crash Twinsanity.     
It's like Jak and Daxter, but with Crash Bandicoot! Great game to finish in an insanely short amount of time. 




 But we do know the ratings. Not enough viewers watched either show to justify selling ad space. That's why they were cancelled. You don't enjoy Fallon, and that's fine. He's popular and attracts viewers, so he's staying on the show. It's safe, so why change anything? It's the right decision to avoid backlash upon changing the host after only one year. 




 They cancelled shows that had bad ratings. What does this prove? 




 I disagree, but everyone has an opinion. 




 Michael Emerson is now one of the leads in Person of Interest, which is pretty popular. 




 I totally understand. As someone who loves Lost deeply, I've got to say I really disagree with anyone who says the pilot is one of the greatest episodes of TV ever.     
That first two-part episode is really not that good on rewatch. It's a show that improves *a lot* as it goes on, in pacing and general quality, and peaks in the final stretch of Season 3. Sawyer's accent wavers between scenes as he was still under the impression he was supposed to be from Buffalo. The final moment where everyone stands around in shock for twenty seconds, *blatantly explaining what they just discovered in case the viewer is braindead*, capping off with the dreadful line "Guys...where are we?" - this entire scene makes me want to die, knowing that anyone I recommend this show to will have to sit through this.    
Very unpopular opinion, but it's the truth. Since GoT, BrBa and many other high quality dramas have come along, that first two-part episode has aged horribly. Thank God the majority of the series, while it gets pretty fucking ludicrous towards the end (I love it, but it's understandable why some would hate what the show becomes), it maintains incredible production value, stellar direction and a badass score. 




 True. It's not like he's portrayed as much of a calculated character. He's an impulsive teenager.
