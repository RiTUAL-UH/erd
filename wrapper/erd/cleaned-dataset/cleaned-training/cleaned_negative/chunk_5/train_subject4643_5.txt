 What !!! Are you kidding me ??  Michael Bay movies are movies of the highest class. He literally raised the bar for micro - budgeted, sci-fi, cgi-oriented movies.
 




 He really wanted to do TWD properly. But, he got fired after season 1. He is now currently working on the screenplay for The Huntsman (2016).

 What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little pleb? Ill have you know that I have the /r/movies's favorite poster flair, and I lurk frequently in /r/truefilm, and I've watched all 250 films on the IMDB top 250 list. I am also the biggest fan of Christopher Nolan. You are nothing to me but just another pleb. I will downvote you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, pleb. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of reddit mods and you will be downvoted and banned swiftly, PLEB. Youre fucking dead, pleb. Not only am I extensively trained in reddit downvoting, but I am also great friends with /u/girafa , you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little clever comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldnt, you didnt, and now youre paying the price, you goddamn pleb. I will downvote fury all over you and you will drown in it. Youre fucking dead, PLEB. [OC] 




 Wow. This is gold. 




 **Interstellar**. 

Nolan made it in 1999. But, thought that it was too advanced for the public and believed that it would be snubbed. So, our savior has time-travelled from 1999 to 2014 to show us this gem of a movie. 

Hope It won't be snubbed in the 2015 oscars. Seig Heil.


P.S I'm in 2012 . Browsing Dank Memes. Brb.  




 My time has come.

Edit : Thanks for the gold. 




 Ye shall ask and Dani has already delivered and been snubbed.

Why did you start this under-rated gem called : The Walking Dead and why did you get fired after starting it ??

 ***Say hello to my little friend*** :

[Scarface](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086250/?ref_=nv_sr_1)

*Director : Brian De Palma*

*Writer : Oliver Stone*

*Stars: Al Pacino, Michelle Pfeiffer, Steven Bauer*

Although 1983 doesn't have as many good movies released as 1994 or 1999. It does have *Scarface*. *Scarface* received a bit of scorn on release from the critics including being nominated for a razzie award. This was mainly due to the fact that it was a remake. But, it was the kind of movie that grew on you after watching it. The epic ending alone makes anyone watch the whole movie again. *[Sigh, here I am watching the ending again.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_z4IuxAqpE)* 

Let's talk about the story now. It is about a Cuban Immigrant (Al Pacino) trying to live the American Dream. That's it. This story paired with *Al Pacino going ham* and Giorgio Moroder's  synth fueled soundtrack adds to the awesomeness of this classic.




 




 Did you like his performance in Robocop ?

Although a short role, where did he do good in move ?

Where did he fall short ? 




 This may be the most apt explanation of the caption. [This scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTxh6DHhyzM) shows how immersed Riggan was in the play world and how he didn't even care what people thought about him in the real world. 




 You should post this to /r/Filmmakers too. They would like it. 




 /r/moviescirclejerk  




 Marvel makes comic book movies.

Oh pls. 




 Where is the master of under-rated movies Nicholas Roeg ?? 









 Le Limitless opened my mind to limitless docking scenes.

 This has been an ongoing debate for the past few days since Chappie has released and my answer is - I don't think so. Although Chappie has received quite a fair amount of backlash, Blomkamp has yet to make a movie on the *Shyamalan* level i.e. on the level of The Village or After Earth. 

I hope Blomkamp goes all out on the alien movie and does his best. He has shown his brilliance in District 9 which is proof he can make groundbreaking films. If the next Alien movie doesn't meet the expectations. Then ... well ... he may become like the present day ridley scott maybe ?? 









 Terry, who did her own stunts, almost lost her life during the filming of The Wizard of Oz when one of the Winkie guards accidentally stepped on her, breaking her foot. She spent two weeks recuperating at Judy Garland's residence, and Garland developed a close attachment.


Terry's salary, $125 per week, was more than that of many human actors in the film, and also more than many working Americans at the time.


Terry died at age 11 in Hollywood on September 1, 1945, and was buried at Spitz's ranch in Studio City, Los Angeles. The grave was destroyed during the construction of the Ventura Freeway in 1958.

 He's got a 'Back to the Future' vibe going on there. 




 -1 ... nah this is politically threatening lets make that -13 




 The Civil War (TV-Mini Series) has a 9.4 on imdb. Might be worth watching 




 I hope it has good laughs like the first. 




 No, this isn't a superhero movie. It is just a movie about people with supernatural powers and lots of dumb decisions by them. 




 What's your favorite Sidney Lumet movie ?? 

Which movie of his do you hate ??

What is your favourite dialogue from a movie of his ??

How good a director do you think he is ?? 




 The daily reminder got snubbed. 




 This is gold. 




 Solaris, Alien, 2001 : A Space Odyssey, Children Of Men, Dawn Of the Planet of Apes (yep), Blade Runner, Terminator, Brazil. 




 2014 : Nightcrawler

2013 : Why Don't You Play In Hell

 Oh, you think the darkness is your ally, but you merely adopted the dark. I was born in it, molded by it. I didnt see the light until I was already a man; by then, it was nothing to me but blinding !^!^!

 It would be better to buy a 4k tv(non-3d) and wait for the 4k blu-rays to release.

 No more string theories now. 




 Yep.

 Get this guy outta here. 









 Usually, most Kubrick films are like this. One guy gives an explanation and another gives a new one. This is why open to interpretation movies can be really refreshing to watch and are discussed constantly. 









 Looks a bit like 'The Help' too. 














 These plebs learn nothing. Just repeat shit again and again.

Edit : Thanks for obligatory gold .

 Early production usually means mostly location scouting and stuff like that. But, yeah they should focus on making one good film at a time. 




 This is a holy worship gathering. How dare you call this something as puny as a subreddit.

 8.4/10 - IMDb

89% - Rotten Tomatoes

4/4 - Roger Ebert

Criminally under-appreciated is a bit of a overstatement. 




  Don't you people miss this documentary, keeps you on the edge of the seat until the very end.  




 Although Al Pacino and Sean Penn have not starred in good films in the recent years, they did some landmark hollywood films in their prime. Al Pacino has The Godfather Trilogy, Scarface, Carlito's Way, Serpico, Heat and many other great movies. Sean Penn is a bit of an inferior actor compared to Al Pacino. But, has directed some great movies and also has starred in classics like Mystic River, Carlito's Way. 

Well, Bruce Willis on the other hand is a bit of a wild card. He can really shine in movies with good directors. But, seems to be having a tough time finding a good role in the recent years.

 Quintin Taranteninolan movies should have more samurai swords in them.   




 Nightcrawler, Jodorowsky's Dune, Whiplash, Secret life of Walter Mitty, Boyhood, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, Snowpiercer, Nebraska, Why Don't You Play in Hell, John Wick
 




 A tough choice between Daniel Day Lewis and Joaquin Phoenix. 




 Why does Kubrick keep copying Nolan's style and grittiness ??? Our savior needs to protect his underrated gems with copyright. 




 That makes her a terrible person too right ?? 




 Well, she wasn't really helping Ben Affleck with anything tbh. Even the police are shady as hell.
