 Ooo great idea will have to revisit this one 




 Its "the walk," Hollywood version of man on wire. 




 That's a good idea, but I'm going to have to wait for the movie to come out. Right where this ends giant "coming soon" "imax 3d" text comes zooming in towards the viewer. My orig idea was to do a huge 3d k zooming in after the 3d imax, but I couldn't get the timing to work. Also I tried fading out "the walk" to just "k" but that looked stupid with my shitty ae skills.

 haha ya idk why, that little jump makes me laugh every time. i love it. 



















 that's a killer thread, surprised to see it's still alive since 2013. i would definitely pay for a native linux port. i wonder what it would take to make at least the save-for-web gif equivalent for imagemagick. no matter what i try i just can't replicate the same level of gif quality using convert or gimp. 




 this is awesome. leave the text jump, it makes it so much funnier.
