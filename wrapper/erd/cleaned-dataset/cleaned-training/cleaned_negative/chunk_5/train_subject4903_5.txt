 Hey dudes and dudettes. Anyone running  AMD cards has problems with the game crashing? As I stated in the title this happened to me even before 9.9. Granted my AMD card is an older one a HD 7770 but I don`t seem to have these problems in other games so the driver/card is fine and I also run the game at low settings. I tried new drivers, even tried reverting back to several older versions but this problem is still there.
