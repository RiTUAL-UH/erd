 Please dont claim that activism is wrong in any way. I know that may not be what you mean (or maybe it is) but it sure sounds like it 




 Hmm so kind of like Christianity

"But marxism endorses mass murder..." can you point out where it says that in the Communist Manifesto

"But the Bibile says nothing about that" neither did marx

IMO Socialist Democracy, implemented in places like Norway and Sweden, works best 




 TBH, It would have ended more like Bahrain if anything occured at the worst case 




 Trump, when you just go and kill everyone you suspect of terrorism and topple a government, it breeds radical ideology

Perhaps this is hard for you to believe, but most countries the US has invaded dont go "YAY the US is coming to save us all!" It  just makes them hate you more, and hate breeds radicalism. so MAYBE STOP DESTABILIZING PEOPLE DAMNiT 




 No you just either 1) Dont know history 2) Refuse to acknowledge when your party is wrong or 3) are trolling  




 Here is how

Saddam Hussein was a horrible dictator, but he was secular and led a stable government. He was also sunni in a majority shia nation. When the US entered into Iraq and began indiscriminately blowing up everything and then set up a shia dominated government, the pissed off young people that just were target practice to Americans were radicalized by Al-Qaeda, and began to hate the shia's for collaborating with the Americans. The former Al-Qaeda In Iraq would rebrand itself and enter into Syria. Before America knew what ISIS would become, they funded it to take down Assad. This blew up in their face, and the rest is history. Not saying what they are doing is right, but America is certainly as fuck not innocent. 

Also, name checks out, why are you supporting a goon for president 




 What do you mean, I dont see much of the IDF in any jail cells
