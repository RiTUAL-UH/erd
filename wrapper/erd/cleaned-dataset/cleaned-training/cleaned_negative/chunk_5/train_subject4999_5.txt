 VERRRY GOOOD 




 It's like pharis hat fuckd the joker!  Also chester's jacket makes zero noise.... 




 Bonewheel skeletons and Bed of Chaos for obvious reasons.
Also I have a problem USING homing soul mass.  I wish it 'homed' better.  If I'm facing two enemies with varying health, I wish it sent one, then two etc to kill first enemy, then used the remaining mass to kill second enemy, as opposed to sending all to enemy that is closest.  But I guess that how's 'homing missiles' work.  I also wished Dragon's Breath sent enemies flying like gravelord souldance.  I mean it's 50 INT and kind of a pain in the ass to get it should do more than it does.  
Also I hope in DS2 that if I'm locked on an enemy and they fall off a cliff, I lose my lock on them as soon as they are in the point of no return on the cliff edge.  

 




 Female, White/Silver hair, Crown of Dusk, Arotrias armor, and an Obsidian Sword 2 handed (moonlight great sword also acceptable) 




 Do it! See how hard it is for us guys to be in this position!  




 Or almost anything besides going to church.  Instead of donating to collection plate take me to actually help people 




 Dark souls  




 Hope these aren't repeats - after killing dragon in painted world you can jump behind his body to go straight to priscilla.  You can kill sif with a bow on the ledge left of his fog gate.  Use your shield (L1) RIGHT at moment of impact to deflect attack without breaking poise 




 Me too :) No sword!
