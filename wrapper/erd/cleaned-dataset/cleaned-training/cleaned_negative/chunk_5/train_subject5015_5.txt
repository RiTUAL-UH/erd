 Shameless plug for /r/mashups. Come join the party! 




 Guns are probably called either Light Electron Blaster I (up close and personal) or 75mm Gatling Rail I (further away). The repair module is probably the Small Armor Repairer I. 




 What was the name of your ship? 




 Nope. You can make a ton of difference in fleet fight with minimal skills.  




 Assuming new character, it takes way more than 2 months (66 days) for something simple like this: https://zkillboard.com/kill/42580382/ . That's not including required fitting skills like PWG/Cap managment (or jury rigging skills), and all level 4 on everything related excluding weapon upgrades. 




 Not me, if you look close enough you can see I said 'near' perfect skills. At least in solo pvp if you want to even try to win the majority of fights, you should have at least all level 4 on the related skills. Of course you can still be really annoying with EWAR at a low skill level, but something like DPS you need good skills or you'll feel useless. 




 Stay classy boys. *tip*. 




 I completely agree, but you have to understand too that even getting near perfect frigate + small weapon skills takes what, a couple of months? Which is nothing to us but huge to people that have played completely different MMO's like WoW. 




 Not very feasable. There are ways to do it, but its quickly going to turn into a job, and is probably an easy way to get burnt out. Sharing money from invites is probably referring to the 21 day trial invite. The inviter gets a PLEX which is worth approximately 930mill isk, as long as you actually upgrade your trial into a full account. If you do this with someone you trust they can split the $$$ with you. 




 http://store.markeedragon.com/catalog/EVE_Online_30_Day_Free_Trial_Code.html You can get a 30 day trial if you don't wish to get the ISK. 




 Yeah, if you have the money buying a character is definately worth it. 




 I pay that because of how much entertainment I get out of it. Lots of fun, and a great community. 




 https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/2n18op/this_is_eve_uncensored_2014_new_trailer_uses/cm9iixv This dude explains it nicely. 




 When warping from system to system (BRAVE Corp.), they got caught in a warp disruption bubble that stops their warp and traps them inside the bubble, stopping them from warping off. As soon as this happened Rooks and Kings used the most expensive ship in the game (titan) to teleport themselves into that bubble. Rooks and Kings were in specially tanked, AOE damage dealing ships. So essentially it's like a group of people walking into an ambush and then throwing molotov cocktails on their faces. Really effective, hard to pull off.

Edit: I take too long to respond apparently! 




 Bought Far Cry 4 when the reviews came out, and now my game won't save. Can someone please test my save to see if it works on your machine (make sure you make a backup of your own save first)? Please only test it on a retail copy. 

Cheers for any help. Here's the save file: http://speedy.sh/EJZw4/Save001.sav 









 Another stupid question, can't some copyright troll just signup for a private tracker and then get the IP's of the peers? I guess that's where using a VPN comes into play?

Edit: Sorry this question was answered below, didn't see it. 




 Okay, thank you! 




 Any idea if the London one is getting posted today? It's getting dark here...

 350k link and 78k commment karma + moderator of a 174 subreddits... sure sounds like someones pushing their own insecurities onto other people.

 This guy seems worse than aura ikko. 




 On the plus side their website is really nice. 




 That videos amazing, and convinced he's better than Kanye West. 




 That fucking giggling in the background. 10/10. 




 I mean publicity = money in this case. He's stated in the past that he lives off ad revenue from Youtube, and you can't deny that this would bring him a lot of it. 




 I caught the video pretty early, and there were not many comments. I saw someone posted a VOD, refreshed a minute later and the comments were gone. 




 I think that's just what Athene heard, it's very possible this dude just abused the exploit in the Jade Forest. 




 Yeah. This is a troll, but he usually dosen't disable comments when someone points this out. 




 Yeah it was meant as a joke, but good advice none the less. 




 Lucky as fuck! I envy you! .__. 




 I guess if you don't care about potentially getting a cease and desist letter it's also okay (https://www.reddit.com/r/trackers/comments/2lptdi/anyone_got_a_cease_and_desist_letter_from_using_a/clxe4w8). 




 He meant public trackers, versus private trackers (ones that require invites). 




 The large majority of people will never have a problem with public trackers. There have been and will be incidents, however, of people recieving cease and desist letters from their ISP, or even being sued because they downloaded something.  




 He's talking about public trackers vs private trackers. 




 Might want to look at this before deciding on IPT: https://www.reddit.com/r/trackers/comments/2m3yri/longtime_ipt_usernever_looked_into_anything/ 




 I know there are VPN's you can get with BTC/throwaway credit card that don't log info like that. I imagine there must be a seedbox with similar policys (given what they're generally used for...). 




 Apparently IPT is one of the few private trackers that people have recieved C D letters from (see https://www.reddit.com/r/trackers/comments/2lptdi/anyone_got_a_cease_and_desist_letter_from_using_a/ ) Also might want to stay away from IPT in general because of this: https://www.reddit.com/r/trackers/comments/2m3yri/longtime_ipt_usernever_looked_into_anything/ .

Unrelated but i've heard from a few places that IPT is actually pretty easy to get into. Can't say though because i've never actually tried... 




 Yeah I agree, would suck if they just took that, but I feel like Valves enough of a good guy greg that they wouldn't, especially in the internet age. 




 Strange, elbititz.net isn't showing for me. Just a completely white, empty page.

 What's that ship? 




 Wondering if anyones got a c d letter from their ISP regarding something they've downloaded/uplodaded on a private tracker... I've heard a few stories of people getting them on public trackers but never private. 




 How come that SS says the blueprints are originals and zkill says they're copies? https://zkillboard.com/kill/42187062/

 Wait so did you jump your jf out then come back in your hound to kill him? 




 I think it's a non-US thing, I'm british and i'll say have as opposed to has in that context. It depends too if you refer to the community as in the singular term for the grouping of people, or the people inside that group. 




 Blacklist was so fucking fun when it first came out. That alone made it worth the money for me. I haven't played in a while cause I got to the max level and it got boring but its sad to here it's gone to shit since, it really was extremely fun at the start. 




 I thought the button bound to crash TF2 was 'connect to server'?  




 I mean game development as in actually programming and designing games.  




 Any tip sfor getting into game dev? Cheers 




 I completely agree. OP could have used reworking the title, and maybe saying upfront that it was a competition between friends. 




 Huh, I wonder what happened in that thread then? Or maybe you'd call that something other than elitism? 




 Thank you for being calm and level headed... it's much needed in this thread. 




 Sure, and I wonder if it's possible to have a friendly discussion as opossed to the rampant elitism and vitriolic comments like in that thread. It's really quite saddening. I personally love chilli, and I think i'll have to make my way down to texas some day because over the pond we don't have nearly as much a following for it! 




 Unfortunately i'd be suprised if this dosen't discourage people quite a lot. I'm curious if this is a common problem in this sub? 




 On top of that, there's the people who upvote them, bringing their virulent comments to the top.  




 Hey,

My apologies in advance if this is in bad etiquette, i'm not sure what the rule is regarding meta/self posts on this sub. 

I don't really frequent this sub, but after looking through the comments of http://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/2k30b0/i_cant_stop_winning_chili_cookoffs/ this post I can't really say that I will now, or understand why anyone else does.

I understand people are passionate about what they love, whether that be chilli or food in general, but there's really no need for the amount of pure vitriol and hatred in that thread. The OP came here to share their love for food, and it's really disgusting that people feel the need to post/upvote (gross 46 upvotes) shit like this: 

Jesus fucking christ. This is almost as bad as that retard last week who posted cheetos and beef jerky as snacks to go with wine. Sonnn.
Recipe for award winning chili: grab a can of everything from the Hispanic shelf at Walmart. Dump in crockpot. Eat with fritos.

and this (gross 15 upvotes)

That looks fucking disgusting. Also, it's not chili, it's "Kentucky Bean and Corn Surprise."

These are only two examples of the purely malicious comments that were posted in that thread. How can you expect people to share in your passion if you try to bully them into accepting your opinion?

If this gets removed because meta/self posts aren't allowed then my only hope is for the mods to take this into consideration.

If it dosen't, then please, think before you type. There's people behind the computer screens, and damn good  way to share your passion for something, and maybe change their opinion, is to be friendly about it, and to teach them like their your friend, not the enemy.

Cheers. 




 Assuming that's the case I don't disagree. And I can completely understand how they might have intended that post to classify this as an exploit, but taking that rule with no context (which shouldn't have to be provided, it should speak for itself), it's ambiguous. I don't think arguing this is going to change anything, however. I understand your point, and if you're right CCP will reimburse the person and maybe banhammer the offenders. Good talk. 




 before it was declared an exploit.

If you're referring to the CCP post, it heavily implies that it's talking about lighting a cyno while the forcefield is already online. I agree it's an exploit (at **best** a clever use of game mechanics) but i'm just not so sure it's *official*. 




 This brings back strange memories of the Camel ATXI raffle... Although I guess if EN24 scammed people then that would mean people wouldn't trust their stories?  




 If I understand your post correctly people knew about lighting a cyno then putting up the forcefield 6 years ago and took that post as saying that was an exploit? Or did people know that they could light one inside an already lit forcefield, as the post implies? Apologies for my ignorance, but I wasn't around for this exploit.

Still, your below post right, it's stupid to even walk on the thin line, whatever CCP's stance. Hopefully this will provoke a statement from them. 




 That post heavily implies you shouldn't be able to light a cyno inside an *already up* field (as opposed to lighting a cyno, then putting up the field), although it does not explicitly state that. Seems to me CCP need's to put out another, clearer, statement on whether this is allowed. After all this is 6 years later too. 




 Pretty simple cause and effect. Life lesson: Stay away from social media when you're mad. He deserved this, I only feel some remorse for him because now his whole career is down the drain because of a moment of rage and stupidity.
