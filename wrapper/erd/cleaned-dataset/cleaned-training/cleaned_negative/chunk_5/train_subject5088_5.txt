 I'm on mac but found the folder. Unfortunately, the adding them back and having to select the download destination for all of them was what I was hoping to avoid as I have 1000+ torrents across 4 different hard drives. Oh well, lesson learned.   




 Sorry should have specified. On mac, didn't have that option checked (which sucks), but I found the equivalent folder and at least all of the torrents files are there.  




 No, just the torrents, but now I have manually add back 1000 torrents across like 4 different hard drives... not a happy camper right now.  




 Sometimes I need to stop all my torrents so I will select all and hit the stop button up top... except this time, while sleep deprived at 4:30 AM in the morning, I accidentally hit the remove button besides it and thus removing ALL of my completed/seeding torrents. Is there an undo function or cache somewhere of these torrents? I literally had 1,000+ torrents and will not be feasible for me to go individually download all of the .torrent files over again. 

Thanks in advance for any advice!  




 I'm going to try my darnest to finish my stupid work Sunday morning so I can be there at 2. 




 Sorry it wasn't when I originally loaded the page. Will delete.

 Completely agree. I'm so glad that she's finally get the recognition she deserves. I've been defending her for years by pointing out she's classically trained and showing people her NYU vid. But now with the Tony Bennett collaboration and this highly visible Oscar performance, I think more and more people will finally realize exactly how talented she is as a musician. 

 




 She recently released one with Tony Bennett: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheek_to_Cheek_%28album%29 




 Completely agree with you. Jake's been on a roll lately: Prisoners, Enemies, and now Nightcrawler. I think we're going to see great things to come.  




 And for anyone else interested in some more of Lady Gaga's less mainstream material :)

 Pawel Pawlikowski was a just a boss at denying that playoff music. I seriously laughed out loud as he kept going and going.

 I would just like to say that Pawe Pawlikowski was a boss at just DENYING that playoff musical.  




 I was also really convinced this was going to be Wes Anderson's year finally.

 And I loved how much they thanked and praised him. So sweet. Wes Anderson is definitely deserving of an Oscar though.  




 Grand Budapest not winning original screenplay (or directing). :( 

Wes Anderson really deserves an Oscar. His entire crew who won awards and thanking him all night was really sweet.  




 Neil Patrick Harris did an awesome job with the Oscar opening number, but I still think his best one was from the 2011 Tony's: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6S5caRGpK4 

As an added bonus, that was the same show he did this duet with Hugh Jackman: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqJxyuTMMog

 Wow... I thought I hated gingham, but after going through your inspo album, I've just realized it can work in so many different ways. Thanks for the post!  




 Yes! This was the one I was looking for. I'm going to make sure to save it this time around so I can always remember the Raleigh Snowpocalypse of 2014 fondly.  




 Which comic is your description from?  




 Does anyone have the AT-AT shop of this pic?  




 The show might only last 3 more seasons, but it'll take George another decade to finish the book series no doubt.  




 This pretty much confirms I can't watch anymore of the TV show for the next decade or so and I have to unsub from /r/gameofthrones.   




 Sigh, if only.  




 Sorry don't have the day off either. :/  




 In no particular order: 

* C T Wok (Morrisville)
* Banana Leaf (Cary) 
* Super Wok (Cary) 
* Grand Asia (Hot Bar) (Cary) 
* Shanghai (Durham)  




 Those are two completely different places with the same name. The one in Cary is authenic Sichuan food and the one in CH is just a Chinese buffet (or at least was the one time I went there a few years ago).  




 Hey! 25/F here also. Love eating, drinking, movies/tv, shows (theater/musicals) and general adventures. Seems like there are quite of few of us in this thread - would you be interested in organizing something for all of us to meet up and grab food or drinks? I can't do this weekend, but will be available the following weekend. Otherwise, feel free to hit me up.  









 I'll be there in a few.  




 There was an eBay like this one on Black Friday. I saw it when I was buying my PS4.  




 I'll be there.  




 YISSSS. Now we just need a timeline and which areas are getting it first.  




 You could try setting something up for a different night too.  




 I totally misread this as "The Martian Chronicles" (by Ray Bradbury). Also amazing btw - you should check it out.  




 What a shame... I consider Mozart to be one of my composers of all time and his body of work, even in his short life, is amazing. I think it would have been fascinating to see how similar or different the works between the two siblings would have been.  




 Just came here to echo all the other comments - my absolute favorite book of all time. There's just nothing quite like an epic tale of revenge spanning decades in the making.  




 It's awesome that he's working out in his SHIELD swag. Guess he's really using that method acting.  




 Anyone know where to watch the French version of this show? I'm really interested in seeing the original after watching this. 

EDIT link here: http://full-stream.net/5920-19-2-saison-2.html 

FYI the French scene is literally 100% the same tracking shot wise (and even shot in the same school). There are some minor differences in terms of acting and timing. The French version seems to close the shot a little better (dialogue wise), again the shot is the same.  




 Also this picture here, confirmation with proof: pic.twitter.com/lUSHtpDfmc 




 My favorite numbers so far (titles are just made up by me): 

* Galavant Main Theme (Ep 1)  
* Hero's Journey (Ep 2) 
* Together (Ep 4) 
* Maybe You're Not the Worst Thing (Ep 4)   




 Stop with the pointless remakes of good British shows. (I'm looking at you Gracepoint.)  




 Holy shit this cast is amazing! 




 Grace's Cafe on Duke campus also has a pretty good bubble tea, but I don't believe there are any stand alone bubble tea places in this area.  




 I made sure I didn't have any other plans or commitments tonight for this.  




 Great article - well written and well researched.  




 Sounds good. Probably won't be there at 2, but expect me sometime around 2:30.  




 Yes! That would be awesome. :)  




 Way too much was cut and the movie looses so much in terms of tone and theme of the original musical. The worse offense being both the act 1 ending number "Ever After" and the act 2 opening number "Once Upon a Time...Later" which is the entire premise of the story as being what happens after the typical "fairy tale" ending. Also, unnecessary change on the death of the Baker's Wife. 

I would really recommend people see another version of this, whether it be live on stage or the recorded version of the original stage production. This is one of my favorite musicals, but so many of the best songs are cut in the movie and it looses so much of it's humor and story in the process. 

Such a shame. Rob Marshall did an excellent job with Chicago... what happened here? 




 That 2nd photo is 100% pure Dorian.  




 Ha, I did my romance research before I picked a gender. Dorian's the reason I went male. 




 Ah ok - awesome. I was starting to worry a little bit.  









 I'll be there - just let me know when you guys decide to start.  




 Can't really help with your question (other than maybe it's fabric) but I did want to give you kudos on your excellent paint drawings - they made me chuckle. 




 Ditto here. I used to live about a mile away from my elementary school and I walked home from school most days starting when I was in 3rd grade. This was only roughly 10 years ago. Cops really just have nothing better to do these days. 




 What do they plan to do with the entire space? I remember hearing something about a park, but 308 acres is a lot.  




 Completely agree. This is why I've given up on award shows a long time ago. I mean like Bradley Cooper and all, but he doesn't hold a candle to Jake Gyllenhaal in Nightcrawler. Or really Jake Gyllenhaal on any day.  




 Wow, is this for every performance? 

EDIT: it is!  




 For dancing, Architect (top 40s with some random older stuff thrown in) and Zinda's (EDM/house) are really your two best options in downtown Raleigh.  




 Still a good deal as long as you don't hate tofu.  




 How much did this all cost? 




 Yup, that was my point exactly. 

BUT The Interview wasn't planned as a VoD release either... so maybe studios would be willing to approve a smaller budget film with a targeted VoD release. In my opinion, not every film demands a moving theater going experience (especially with the prices of tickets these days), but for smaller films or dramas will little action that necessitates a big screen viewing, this could be a great way to capture revenue from people who might otherwise just pirate it or watch it TV or rent it later.  




 All the movies here are great recs - I just want to add two more: Incendies (by the same director as Prisoners and Enemy) and The Drop.  




 This is impressive considering how unplanned the VOD release was. However, you have to temper that with the fact that this movie had HUGE publicity proceeding it, beyond what they planned on marketing so at the end of the day, this will still be a bit of an anomaly. 

Still, it will be interesting to see if Hollywood decides to use this as a case study and attempt to do more VOD related releases (whether it be stand alone or simultaneous with a big screen release).  




 The /r/trianglegamers group meets in Morrisville if you want to give it a shot - we're actually looking for some new people as a few people moved away recently. We start Sundays around 5 - come check it out! I've been going for over a year now and it's a great group.

 I've never been to one of these Raleigh meetups, but I think I might check this one out.  




 I won't be back from the winter break until next weekend so I'll see you guys next week.  




 Any experience or comments about this process? Do they always have tickets available for day of?  




 Hi guys, so I've heard a lot of things are closed during this period - just wondering how bad it is. I'm visiting with my family - do we need to make reservations or probably just be able to wander about and just find a place to eat whenever we feel like breaking? I'm asking in particular about the night of Dec 24th and Dec 25th. 

Also, are all places and shops closed on Dec 25th or are some things still open. Do you guys have any recommended areas for these days (aside from touristy sights like cathedrals or museums). 

Thanks!  




 Death of a fan favorite character?  




 Yes, please.  




 I didn't get the gift card that was supposed to come with the PS4 - I ordered online though.  




 Is it all night or just before a certain time?  














 Aannd still working... might be a no show this week.  




 I've got a lot of work to do today, but I'll try to make it. I probably won't be there until 7 or 8 at the earliest, but I'll update this post later today with my status.  




 Upload to imgur and link here.  




 Might be interested - can you post a pic?  




 It's ok, I bought here: http://www.ebay.com/itm/111546676176?_trksid=p2059210.m2749.l2649 ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT 

Only $20!  




 Ugh. Seller "relisted" at $10 more.  




 Can you imagine the shock if you just happened to drop in for a burger and turn around and see the entire cast of AoS sitting nonchalantly there? I'm pretty sure I would shit my pants, stare at them for a bit, squeal, and then run over to say hi.  




 Completely agree on It's Always Sunny - I just don't like humor/comedy that lies on stupidity. It's just sort of tragic and cringe inducing in my books. Same reason I couldn't get into Arrested Development.  




 Ditto - it took me 5 tries to get into Mad Men. It's still not my favorite, but once I got through the first season and a half or so, the show just really started to flow for me.  




 Judging from his expressions, Colbert's life is now complete.  




 cc me too! Thanks!  




 Now let's hope some of this recognition will translate to increased viewers and Bryan Fuller can complete his vision of the TV show.  









 I'm not quite as far as you, but I would say the first 25 hours of play was relatively fine for me as well (banter was a little lower than usual but not alarmingly so). But after I got to Skyhold, shit just started breaking. Hours 25-40 has been buggy as hell (and basically no banter now) and I've actually had to stop playing because it's so bad.  




 I really hope by fixing some of these audio issues, it improves the banter/bgm bugs by extension somehow.  




 Second this. The fifty shades of bald did not impress me.  




 Ditto happened to me. He confirms and nothing changes and the options reappear.  




 Joining the military? Psh please - I'm leading an inquisition here.  




 Won't make it this week. 

As much as I love all of you guys... I just got a PS4 and Dragon Age Inquisition this week... see you all in roughly 150 hours or so. 




 This guarantees that I will watch this.   




 This is motherfucking AWESOME.   




 Completely agree on this. That's what I plan to do for my future wedding. At least that way they can get a dress of a style they want.  




 Wtf - Target Australia has actually pulled this game off shelves due to this?  




 Bridesmaid dresses are different. For some weddings, the bride is very specific about the exact dress or exact color and style of dress that she wants her bridesmaids to wear. In this situation, you are forced to buy a dress that you never wear again because of how impractical it is or if it's ugly and not really your style. These are the sacrifices you make for friendship.  




 I'm super excited but I'll reserve judgement until I either see gameplay or play it myself. Plus it's a little weird to see Sledgehammer making COD zombies instead of Treyarch so let's see how they do.  









 I love it - this is amazing!  




 I'll be there around 530. With soup. 




 Thanks! You're awesome!  




 Thanks! You're awesome!
