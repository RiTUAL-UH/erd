 ik, and ill be sure to update it once further progress is made. :) 




 Firstly, i know thats not how heightdata works, its just a basic placeholder so i know where i will eventually put them, and build around them and not worry about elevation. And thanks for the additional tips, ill be sure to keep them in mind 




 Ill be sure to take a look at those videos soon, but for the moment i added some mountains/hills that are actually in ireland, its not pretty, but it will do the job

 So i have added some new ideas to my map (it is still just a drawing that i have moved from paint into paint.net to allow me to have more freedom to do assorted things) First, some 'story' about parts of the map. the northern most city, "North City" has a tall wall going around the surrounding area. Players will need special clothes in order to survive the radiation of north city for more than a minute. North City will have lots of military loot and will (hopefully) be a hotspot for players to go to to get good gear. This idea isn't even 10% done, so any feedback would be highly appreciated.

 If i were ever to make it it would be somewhat smaller than altis, its just the shape that i am getting from ireland 




 i can always just make it smaller if i ever end up actually making it 




 The terrain is a 70% replication of the island of Ireland, rotated 90* to the left. I have some basic ideas on where mountains will be, but haven't given much thought into choke points yet. no cities or towns have been added yet, as i am having trouble designing them 




 So i gave up on making the design for this map awhile ago, but recently started working on it again. Here is the basic drawing: http://imgur.com/lWDKGJp Each square is 1 Km by 1 Km, at the longest points it is 14 Km horizontally, and 12 Km vertically. Soon i will add mountains and elevation lines. all feedback is wanted. 




 yep, because as long as its in alpha, it still applies  




 So at the moment i have a basic map i made in Paint, and i want to know what software i need to make it look like the maps of chernarus and other maps, any and all help is highly appreciated.

 what i really like is the gloomy clouds and the street lamps, as well as the flooded area. its good, and i look forward to exploring its depths. (you should put some easter eggs like hidden areas or messages)
