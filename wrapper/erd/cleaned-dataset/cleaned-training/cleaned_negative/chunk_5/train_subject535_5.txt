 I meant you can. Plant patents have existed since the 30's and plant variety protection started in the 70s.  




 You can get a patent or PVP on an already existing crop, now if you modified the plant through conventional breeding or genetic engineering you can get protection on the newly created variety. 
  
Edit: Typo can't to can

 Because it's new and paying a premium for a used one is the only way some people will get one in a reasonable time.  




 But it's not based on the book Bladerunner.  




 You have proof right? 




 You can get patents and patent like protection for non-GE plants since the 1930s.

Overall in terms of increase yields and decreased pesticide use Bt-cotton has been a significant plus to farmers in India. 
   




 Maybe you should read what you post. Bowman bought outbound grain and used glyphosate to select for Monsanto's trait. His actions were a willful and intentional attempt at avoiding paying Monsanto's licensing fees.  




 Polluting our food supply with their patented genes, and then seizing other farmers' crops when they test positive for those patented genes.
  
Thank god that has never happened! 




 Which is why I always try and pay with a card.

 What poisonous chemicals? 




 aggressively pursue farmers that grow these GMO crops despite the fact that they may spread their progeny naturally for miles around
  
Monsanto has never sued over accidental cross pollination, they only sue over willful and intentional isolation and growing without a licensee. Example being the case cited in Food Inc over Percy Scmeiser.
  
 I'll quote the actual court case.
  
[In late June or early July of 1997, Mr. Schmeiser and his employee Carlyle Moritz hand sprayed Roundup around power poles and in the ditches along the Bruno road where it bordered fields 1, 2, 3 and 4. This was part of his normal weed control practice. Several days after the spraying, he noticed that a large number of canola plants had survived the spraying. To determine why the canola plants had survived the Roundup spraying, Mr. Schmeiser conducted a test in field 2. Using a machine sprayer set to spray 40 feet, he sprayed Roundup on a section of field 2 in a strip along the road. He made two passes, the first weaving between and around the power poles and the second adjacent to the first pass, parallel to the power poles. He testified that by this means he sprayed a good three acres of field 2. According to Mr. Schmeiser's evidence, after some days, approximately 60% of the canola plants sprayed were still alive, growing in clumps that were thickest near the road and thinner as one moved into the field.[23]At harvest time in 1997 Mr. Schmeiser, who was then recovering from a leg injury, instructed Mr. Moritz to swath and combine field 2. Mr. Moritz did so, harvesting the canola in the field as well as the surviving canola along the roadside. The harvested seed was put into the box of a 1962 Ford pickup truck. The box was covered with a tarp and the truck with its tarped load of canola seed was stored in one of Mr. Schmeiser's buildings over the winter.[24]Mr. Schmeiser testified that in the spring of 1998 the seed from the Ford truck was transferred to another truck and taken to the Humboldt Flour Mill for treatment, a normal process to rid the seeds of disease before planting. The treated seed, mixed with untreated seed from his granary ("bin-run seed"), was planted in all or part of each of his nine fields, for a total of 1,030 acres.](http://decisions.fca-caf.gc.ca/en/2002/2002fca309/2002fca309.html)  
  
  
His crop did not magically become 95-98% RR canola purity overnight and the court realized this. Schmeiser was not sued over accidental cross pollination, but over intentionally isolating RR canola plants and planting the seed the following year. 
  
  
There was also the more recent OSGATA V. Monsanto case, in which OSGATA sued Monsanto over aggressive/bullying practices, the judge throughout the case because OSGATA could not prove their claim in court. 
  
  From the Court Case.  
  

[Taken together, it is clear that these circumstances do not 
amount to a substantial controversy and that there has been no 
injury traceable to defendants. We therefore do not have subject 
matter jurisdiction over this action, and it is, accordingly, 
dismissed](http://www.osgata.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/OSGATA-v-Monsanto-MTD-Decision.pdf)
  
Monsanto has actually sold these chemicals knowing that they are toxic both to humans, animals and the environment.
  
You're going to need a citation for this, but I believe you are talking about glyphosate/roundup which is generally safe and poses little harm to humans when properly used.

Also about suing farmers, Monsanto only sues over willful and intentional isolation of their license seed. They don't sue over accidental cross pollination. 
  
Also there is little evidence that Monsanto is aggressively going after farmers. Recently OSGATA a consortium of organic farmers attempted to preemptively sue Monsanto over aggressive actions, but the case failed due to lack of any evidence provided proving the claims against Monsanto were true.

 Stephen Ostroff has never worked for Monsanto. 




 Yes that's the current drug form GW Pharmaceutical, but that study was not blinded. It's the next stage that is planned to actually test for efficacy of the drug as a treatment for epilepsy.  




 Just under epilepsy most the the links were 404s and the only one that was at all relevant (blinded) had a really small sample and lack of statistical analysis.  




 How many of those are clinical controlled studies? 




 I'm just happy that my ideas are getting the mainstream attention that they deserve.  




 Alternative medicine is not marketed as a drug because it's illegal to do so the US. Hence why all herbal medicine comes with a disclaimer on the packaging.
  
 




 [I'd be shocked if either grew.](http://www.homedepot.com/catalog/productImages/400/d2/d21d4f32-78f9-4e2a-a3e9-dd99f8ef3057_400.jpg) 




 I disagree, I believe that its the governments responsibility to ensure safe guards when it comes to medication in order to ensure that there is a threshold of safety and efficacy taken into account. I don't believe that we should allow people to peddle snake oil and alternative medicine as scientifically effective treatments.  




 Are you saying those dozens of parents are lying and that it is just coincidental ?

  
Until there is actual controlled data we'll never know. It could be an actual effect, it could be confirmation bias, or it could be a placebo effect.  




 You mean supporting the current law when it comes to all medical drugs?  




 We should ban the marketing, selling, and prescription of herbal home remedies as an effective treatment for disease or illness.  




 I'm not talking about legalization of drugs, I'm talking about the use of a marijuana as medical drug used to effectively treat disease or illness.  




 A therapeutic index of 1. 




 There actually is a clinical trial being conducted at the moment looking into MMJ effect on seizures in children. So far there results look promising but the current completed phase wasn't blinded as it was only looking for safety of the concentrate/extract.  




  Just that things that only feel very good tend to be made more illegal than things just feel ok.

I think this is confirmation bias, for who cares about the things that don't make us feel good that are made illegal.  




 Again, my issue is with the use of it as a medical drug without the proper testing   studies. 
  
I'm ambivalent to its legalization and support removing it from its current DEA schedule 1 status. I'm against using it to treat disease and illness when there is no strong evidence supporting its efficacy.  




 Doctors and mmj clinics are prescribing and selling it as a drug in many states.  




 My stance is simple. MMJ lacks the required clinical evidence to support its use as a drug. Once proper testing is done I'd me fine with it being prescribed by trained professionals. 
  
You are the one who doesn't care about the actual evidence.  




 Yeah, because I desire adequate evidence before I want to see something marketed and sold as a drug.  




 [Citation Needed]  




 No one is claiming that jumping off a sky scraper is going to treat epilepsy.  




 And I agree, the punishments for marijuana use/possession are way to harsh and there is to much control over research of the plant and its chemicals.  




 Again, an anecdotal account is not sufficient evidence to base medical policy off of.  




 I don't believe marijuana is dangerous enough to be classified as a schedule 1 drug.  




 Deciding what drug to use to treat an illness or disease has nothing to do with DEA scheduling.  




 US isn't the only country, and many of these studies have been in the work long before the recent rounds of states legalizing it.
  
I'm not denying that there are too many regulations on the study of cannabis and its chemical derivatives.  




 And hundreds of families have traveled to Texas to be treated by Burzynski "medicine".  




 I don't really care what other people consume, I do care that people are marketing marijuana as an effective drug for treating hundreds of illnesses and disease without strong empirical evidence.  




 I'm not saying marijuana is bad for you, only that the evidence that supports its use as an effective medicine is weak.  




 GW Pharmaceutical is running trials in the US looking into cannabis as a treatment for epilepsy in children. They also have already put to market a cannabis based medication for the treatment of MS in Europe, and there are several trials looking into using it in cancer patients.  




 Nope, I just want some strong empirical evidence stemming from controlled clinical trials before I'm comfortable with selling anything as a drug. 




 Typo, I meant enema 
  
http://www.cancer-treatment-tips.com/coffee-enema.html 




 It's not, there are several on going trials as we speak.  




 Most illnesses that mmj is claimed to treat aren't support by controlled clinical trials. This is a fact. 




 We have anecdotal evidence that coffee edemas cure cancer and vaccines cause autism. Thank god we don't base medical decisions off these accounts. 




 You are making the assumption that this treatment is actually effective at treating seizures.  




 It's a lack of clinical controlled studies, the same threshold that any other new drug has to meet before it can be sold as a drug.  




 Studies are being done. 




 I'm against the current use of MMJ, from the lack of strong clinical data showing its efficacy to how it's administered/prescribed.  




 Self reported study and a case report. 
  
There is ample evidence to support further research of cannabis into treating epilepsy in children, but the evidence today is far short of supporting it as a proven medical treatment.  




 How? Evidence for the effectiveness of MMJ is lacking for many illnesses it is claimed to cure. Just because people have been using marijuana for "decades" doesn't make up for the lack of empirical evidence.  




 There's actually a current study going on that is looking into the effects of a MMJ extract on epilepsy in children.
  
[So far they have tested for safety of the extract and they are moving onto effectiveness of the treatment soon.](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/04/150413183743.htm) 




 No it doesn't.  




 It's not about not understanding the MoA, it's that most of MMJ health benefits are based on anecdotal accounts that are akin to snake oil and other alternative medicine.  




 This is what I believe, except it wasn't Cheney but NASA. For NASA was hiding the official tapes on how they faked the moon landing in the WTC, the Pentagon, and some random field in Pennsylvania.  




 Get out of bed and drag a comb across my head. 




 From the first time I saw that scene, my immediate question was "Why ISN'T Walt a university professor? With his credentials, why is he teaching at a public high school?"
  
My guess is no one actually likes working with him, Walt always came off as sort of an ass.  




 [That study has come under criticism.](http://scientificbeekeeping.com/the-harvard-study-on-neonicotinoids-and-ccd/) And a recent study by the USDA   EPA cast doubt on the roles of [neonicotinoids and CCD.](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0118748)

 All GMOs can go to seed and non-GMOs can be patented.  




 Basically you have either glyphosate or glufosinate tolerant genetically engineered crops. But you also have non GE crops that have been made herbicide resistant to herbicides such as sulfonylurea and imidazolinone. 




 How are those estimates inaccurate?

 If you're lucky. 




 Power delivery of the Tesla is a result of how electric motors lose power at high speeds.

 Singapore has the lowest drug use and abuse of any country in part due to their strict and authoritarian laws.  




 Prohibition has never worked.
  
Except in Singapore.  




 True.
