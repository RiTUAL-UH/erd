 I read it a few years ago. I was just completely blown away by it. The writing style is amazing especially the focalisation on the main character. I loved how the novel captures the grey area of morality in modern society.  




 My high school philosophy teacher gave me the myth of Sisyphus at a dark time in my life. It was a very interesting book. Since then I've read a few others including the stranger. I would recommend reading the collection of Camus's notebooks.  




 I think 14 is a good age to read that book. Its around those years which you begin to consider the depths of morality. I found the book enthralling and I still enjoy it. Though I read The Great Gatsby  at 18, and all though I found it to be well written, the themes and messages were things I had already considered through other media. Of course this shows the impact of the novel on society, I'm just saying that some of those novels written in a different time or place are more significant at younger ages.  




 Thank you for the time you invested in writing this post. I appreciate the advice very much. 
I agree with you wholeheartedly! Especially concerning skepticism when it comes to the kindness of friends opinions. I do want to one day be a great writer. I think I just have to learn to stay on the self assessment side, because being a defeatist will get me nowhere.  




 I have, it's quite heavy, but it certainly opened my eyes to a side of philosophy that i had not previously considered.
