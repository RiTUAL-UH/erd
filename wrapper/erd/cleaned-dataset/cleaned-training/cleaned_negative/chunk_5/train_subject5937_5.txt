 This is a very good interview (8 min) with **Michael Hudson** (a Distinguished Research Professor of Economics at the University of Missouri, Kansas City, and author of *The Bubble and Beyond and Finance Capitalism and its Discontents* and *Killing the Host: How Financial Parasites and Debt Bondage Destroy the Global Economy*) and **William K. Black** (author of *The Best Way to Rob a Bank is to Own One*, professor of economics and law at the University of Missouri Kansas City).

Edit: Part 2 of the interview is also *very* good. 




 NATO, Europe and the US have mutual interest in not allowing Russia's continued expansionist position. Putin needs to be stopped. 




  too many laws have to be changed to make bankruptcy possible

And, it would change the terms of debt that was issued, with investors understanding that bankruptcy was *not* a possibility.  




 [And 2014's Worst Currency Was...Bitcoin](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-12-23/and-2014s-worst-currency-wasbitcoin)

Its plunge of more than 56 percent in 2014 makes it the world's worst performing currency this year, according to Bloomberg, which tracks 175 foreign-exchange values.

And it's down another 17% year-to-date. 




 Yes   no. Extremely well produced and acted. The writing is very good. The plot drrrrrraaaaaags along through several episodes. However, the slow plot progression allows for in-depth personal development of many characters, interpersonal relationships, analysis of "career choices" (for cops, politicians and drug dealers), and political commentary. 

Yes, its good - but only if you have patience as the plots play out.

 That's it - - **lactating vegans**. 




 Human trafficking / sex slavery.  




 **Fans**. And if you only have one window get a dual fan where one can blow out while the other  blows in to circulate air.

Get a *quiet* indoor fan (3 speed).

If you take a quick shower to cool off, slowly dry off in front of the fan for extra cooling. 




 True **multitasking** - - the ability to focus on multiple tasks simultaniously.

  Kennedy is the most powerful person in the United States right now

Very valid point - I hadn't thought of that, but I think you are correct.  




 Yes. Being too subtle in sarcastic posts is the riskiest type of Reddit sarcasm. It frequently gets me in trouble (but sometimes sparks interesting replies). Cheers.

 Her husband left her for one of her relatives

She got custody of the  youngest kids, then moved states to marry my dad.

She raised us all just like we were all hers.

After years, we moved back to where her ex lived.

She forgave both, healed the wounds, and brought us all together so we are all one big family that does family events regularly.

 Similar thing happened many years ago in my town on a pedestrian/bike overpass walkway. The kid on the bike died. I don't recall if they caught the guy who strung the wire. 




 I remember I had a great time, but I can't even remember which concert that was. I didn't care. I had another job in a week or so. 




 [The **Brazen Bull**,](http://www.worldmysteries.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/the-Brazen-Bull.jpg) bronze bull, or Sicilian bull, was a torture and execution device designed in ancient Greece. Perillos of Athens invented and proposed it to Phalaris, the tyrant of Akragas, Sicily, as a new means of executing criminals. The bull was made entirely of bronze, hollow, with a door in one side. The bull was in the form and size of an actual bull and had an acoustic apparatus that converted screams into the sound of a bull. The condemned were locked in the device, and a fire was set under it, heating the metal until the person inside roasted to death. 




 I wanted to go to a concert so I traded shifts and bought the tickets. After that the manager said "new policy - no trading shifts." I explained that I already arranged it before the new policy. He said I had to choose between the job and the concert.

It was a great concert.

 The TPP gives private corporations new tools to undermine national sovereignty and democratic processes. Specifically, TPP would give multinational companies the power to sue countries over laws that  might diminish the value of their company or cut into their expected future profits.Critics understand that this redrawing of the boundaries of copyright law by the globalists secretly deliberating and drafting the TPP is an attack on our laws, our courts, our freedom of expression, our Constitution, and our sovereignty.  




 Immaculate deception  




 I agree. By "America" I meant the majority of Americans. 

What a majority of Americans want is much less influential on enacted policy than what donors and lobbyists demand.

 




 There is a large difference between what the general American population wants, and what our "representatives" do. Research shows that popular opposition to (or support for) a policy has a small effect in a majority  of cases. However, support/opposition from a much smaller constituency of "influential" entities has significant effect. This small minority of wealthy contributors, (individual, corporate, PACs, etc.) and lobbyists has a much greater impact on US policy. 

TLDR: What a majority of Americans want is much less influential on enacted policy than what donors and lobbyists demand.  




 I agree - Iran will stay the course and just keep delaying.

PS - The earliest predecessor of the game of chess probably originated in India, before the 6th century AD; a minority of historians believe the game originated in China. From India, the game spread to Persia. When the Arabs conquered Persia, chess was taken up by the Muslim world and subsequently spread to Southern Europe.

They did invent the first human civilization, and the first empire in the world, the Persian Empire.

Roving bands of evil magicians forcefully making people disappear. This sorcery will not stand! 




 America is also getting tired of being the primary defender of the free world, and of fully committing to NATO when other countries - the countries more at risk - don't step up.  




 Can confirm - my ex has created an entire universe of false memories in which she resides and fully believes.  




 Supreme Court Justices can be voted out - A Supreme Court Justice may be impeached by the House of Representatives and removed from office if convicted in a Senate trial, but only for the same types of offenses that would trigger impeachment proceedings for any other government official under Articles I and II of the Constitution. 




  Republican behavior toward the president

Republican behavior toward the *FIRST BLACK* president ...

I believe he was also called a liar during his SOTU speech, and was called a nigger. 




 So he and Marvin Hamlisch each won the "PEGOT". Nice.

My large intestine disagrees with you.  




 I must have missed those few funny ones. I just don't see the entertainment value. 




 I wear a suit to work and hate all the fur on my work clothes.

I keep all my work clothes in a room where we do not let any pets go.

Thus at home or in casual clothes I'm a furry. At work I'm nice and clean.  




  tensions between Mexican and American students, past events, Judge M. Margaret McKeown wrote, "made it reasonable for school officials to proceed as though the threat of a potentially violent disturbance was real."

Dress codes in schools have repeatedly been upheld - as have searches that would not be legal if conducted outside of a school.

If you want more rights at school, try home school. At a public school you are a minor within a govt. institution.  




 In my city in CA we just voted down a special election sales tax increase for "infrastructure" that had too many loopholes.

A month later they pass a general budget with funding for many special pet projects but NOTHING for infrastructure. 

I guess they don't get reelected running on "no bridges fell down on my watch".

The re-election system is broken.

  There just wouldn't be anybody to name these concepts

So are they "concepts" or fundamental facts/truths of the universe?

Without humans, stars, planets, and elements exist.

Without humans, does math exist? I'm just asking (and apparently pissing off Redditors by asking). 




 I have to admit, I was a bit flippant in my phrasing. That said, I didn't expect this level of piling on without interest in intellectual pursuit. Especially in a post about mathematical proofs. Very ironic.  




 I have found the downvotes without cogent supporting arguments to be disappointing. Of course I have only myself to blame.  




 Right now I'm thinking a Rubio vs. Sanders election would be very interesting. 

But I have miles to go before I vote. Time will tell.  




 An analogy is like a metaphor (or a simile) but with a logical argument added.

 Mathematics and music, the most sharply contrasted fields of scientific activity which can be found,
and yet related, supporting each other, as if to show forth the secret connection which ties together
all the activities of our mind, and which leads us to surmise that the manifestations of the artist's genius are
but the unconscious expressions of a mysteriously acting rationality. 19th century German physician and physicist Hermann von Helmholtz 




 A compound statement, that is always true regardless of the truth value of the individual statements, is defined to be a tautology.

Math proves itself to exist, and to be true.  









 Well, one could simply have **faith** in the existence of the mathematical constructs.  




 [Sure. Here is a very good exploration of this topic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbNymweHW4E feature=youtu.be)

Thanks for asking. JLP. 




 Republican States = welfare states

Democratic States = faring well states 




 So, I don't like to discuss it much, because when I do I have to admit that I'm really just having a conversation with myself (since you are simply a construct of my own reality).

Also it ends up with me causing myself to downvote myself, which is just odd. 




 This is why I was proud to see Rand Paul filibuster for 10 1/2 hours against renewing the Patriot Act and NSA snooping.

 If by "more people" you mean my manager, and if by "understood about your job" you mean had a fucking clue, it would be that what he wants me to be doing is not even close to what I was hired to do.

 As a metaphysical solipsist, I disagree. In fact, my self is the only existing reality and all other reality, including the external world and other persons, and Reddit are representations of my self, and have no independent existence. I am all that exists.  




 In addition, new drivers should follow the 4 second rule. When the car in front of you drives over a paint line, count slowly to 4. If you pass it before 4, you are following too close.

Yes, this means others will pass you and merge into that space - which can be annoying.

But it's not as annoying as causing an accident when the car in front brakes quickly and you're not prepared.  




 Or by machine gun firing squad, or burned alive by flame thrower, or ...

 At year 5 it's sunk cost. But how do you decide year after year for 40+ years to pay the bill for a freeze full of meat with diminishing value.

That is real cost, plus opportunity cost.  




 Knowledge of anything outside my own mind is unsure.  The external world and other minds cannot be known for sure and might not even exist outside of my mind. The universe, the world and other minds may not exist, and I have no way of proving that they do.

You kind Redditor are likely a construct of my mind which is simply creating an illusionary universe as a form of amusement.  




 It's like looking at the ocean and seeing a division between the sand and the ocean. But the "division" doesn't really exist. The beach exists, and the ocean exists, but the "division" is an illusion.

Similarly, there is no "present". It is an illusion of our senses interpreting what has happened in the past few minutes, seconds, milliseconds, etc. . . . in anticipation of what is to come in the future. 




 No thanks. I've already got a bitch that treats me like a god. She's a rescue, so some behavior will always be a mystery, but that's a small price for unconditional love.  




 Stop pushing! It hurts, and I like it in here! 




 Math is a man-made construct and is a complete illusion.

There is no physical proof that math actually exists. 

Edit 1 - After several downvotes I have seen no response with an argument as to why we should see math as a given feature of the universe rather than simply a human creation. The downvotes without responses make me more convinced that I am correct. If I could come up with a counter argument, I would. 

Edit 2 - Since I was finally asked below for proof of my position, you can take a look at [this entertaining and very well thought out video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbNymweHW4E feature=youtu.be) 




 It's safe. It is simply a reply to /u/hurdur1 




 The cap of the cigar secures the wrapper and closes off that end. The closed off cap must be cut off to be able to draw air through the body of the cigar.

The other end (the foot) which is to be lit, is open and does not need to be cut.

 




 THIS! - - Rescues are the best.  




 The present is an illusion. Only the past and the future exist.

The "present" is an imaginary line between the past and the future.
