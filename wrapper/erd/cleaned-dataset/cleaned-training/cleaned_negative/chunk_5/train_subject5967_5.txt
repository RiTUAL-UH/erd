 I'm sorry to see them swap out the main female lead

This might change your mind.

The plot is based around a incident in Sioux Falls in the 1970s. This incident involved Molly's father (Lou) and is canonical to the series, infact it was referenced in season 1 several times. So while it will have a new set of leads, there are plenty of references to keep the series whole :)

I'm really fucking excited for this one.



 




 Cum inside (   ) 




 I'm so glad that you used 'than' instead of 'then'. It would've been a hilarious title if you had though :) 




 Australian reporting in. People can live off being a server down here. Tipping seems entirely stupid as a concept. That being said, I do unload any unwanted shrapnel in the tip jar at coffee shops. 




 I think the problem is that wedding tackle in yoga pants will likely scare children. 




 My most prolific relationship started as a random hook up and ended up after a long battle becoming a fantastic LTR. I wrote  a [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/38fd7t/ok_askmen_now_that_weve_heard_your_stupid_stories/cruy75f?context=3) about it a while back.

Now that I think about it, nearly all of the girls I've dated have been from just random encounters. 




 This is the thing though, friend zone has become bastardised. I always thought it meant that extremely rare woman who knowingly strings a guy along to get free shit from him. Nowadays, anytime some dude gets rejected he gets 'friend zoned'. It is embarrassing. I hate the word entitlement, but it kinda applies there. 




 - Black science man. 




 Having hair. 

I see posts from women who talk about loving guys hair. I started going bald at 22 and at 27 I now fully shave my head. So while I'm ok with it, when you hear that having hair is a deal breaker, I do get some insecurity with it. 




 I find zero need to rely on it. My parents brought my siblings and I up with no mention of religion. I have a awesome family, good morals and a positive future. All without religion. 




 Its gotta be, right? 




 Yeah, rub that lamp (   ) 




 How has no one referenced the [Beck v Eiland-Hall case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beck_v._Eiland-Hall) of 2009. This is honestly one of the funniest things you'll read.

A satirist used Glenn Becks obnoxious style of 'journalism' to insinuate that Glenn Beck raped and murdered a girl in 1990.

It's insanely funny and he ended up winning the suit. It also ended up becoming a rather amusing example of the Streisand Effect.

 




 knock on wood  (   )  




 It's true, I'm obviously not doing what I'm doing for the reaction of others. But that look is pretty damn awesome.

When my friend called me ravishing, it was rather funny. I was talking to her and I took off my hoodie. I then noticed her looking me up and down, it was like really obvious and she just kinda stopped me in the middle of my sentence "Holy shit, have you lost weight, like - a lot of weight?"

 




 Route and Router.

Australia is inconsistent at times. 

We pronounce 'Route' as 'Root' but we don't call a 'Router' a 'Rooter'.

Americans have us beat on that I guess.

For further hilarity, *root* is slang for sex in Australia.

So Route 69 is funnier than ever. 




 Can confirm.

**Wooster sheer sauce: am Australian.** 




 Thanks! You should've seen her face when I got off the scale. It was awesome. 




 She didn't know what a blowjob was.

So I first heard the word 'blowjob' in the school yard and in my innocence I asked my brother what it meant. He being the older sibling told me to ask our mum (prick was fucking with me). I asked mum, with literally no idea what it was and she said "Oh I have no idea". I went through life happy with the notion that my mum has never heard of oral sex before.

Years late this story took a more R rated revision, much laughter was had and all of it was at my expense.

**Edit: I want to follow that up with a nicer story**, growing up I had a very active imagination and I used to get really horrible and vivid nightmares. It was rather crippling. I had one reoccuring one where I would dream about a monster in my closet. I had this dream several times a week and my mother rushed into my room asking what was wrong, I tearfully told her about my dreams so she said she was going to get the *monster spray*. "What's *monster spray?*" I asked "You've never heard of this? It's a old family secret for getting rid of those nasty monsters". 

So she took this unlabeled water spray bottle and sprayed the closet. I had never slept better after that. I got placebo'd and I love her for it. 




 Unless you're like me and you just started doing strength training. My body hates me haha 




 I'm sorry to hear about that /u/Sarahthelizard.

Are you at least being accepted into the lizard community? 




 I was asked something last night which made me think. Someone asked "Woah, why are you in such a good mood?". It's a simple enough question, but upon thinking about it...


This has been a good fucking week.  


First, I finally had my **whoosh** and dropped a chunk of weight. This drop brought me down to a BMI of 35 (that's 6 bmi points since I started 3 months ago), that's 38 lbs dropped and 4 inches off my waist.

Also, a friend who noticed my weight loss referred to me as 'ravishing'. That one hit home :)

This surge of awesomeness gave me some serious motivation and I've been hitting the gym with more fervor then ever. I had initially been doing a 4 mph fast walk for 45~ minutes with small 5 mph jogging increments, this week I was able to have a total of 15 minutes of jogging into my 45~ minute work out. This is without any soreness or discomfort [(Here is the FitBit graph for that workout, I love me some data)](http://i.imgur.com/d4UGzZn.png). I can actually take on stairs without any shortness of breath. Adding to this, after Mondays workout while stretching my calves I noticed a dude staring at my calves. He then said "nice calves man", as a straight guy, I'm not used to getting random dude compliments - it was pretty awesome.


And finally, nearly 3 months ago I had a physical with my doctor, where I announced that I was going to lose weight. She was supportive and gave me lots of information to help me, but she had this weird tone in her voice, like she had heard this 1000 times before and she was almost reading off a script. She kept on mentioning for me to manage expectations and ensure discipline and all that stuff. I knew even then that this time was different than the other times. I knew I could do this. I still can't explain why.

So yesterday was our 3 month follow up to discuss my progression and do any further blood work (had worries about my iron levels, turns out I'm ok! :D). She was beyond excited to see my progress, she admitted that she constantly see people who can't follow through and it's rare to see such spontaneous progress without some sort of mortal danger precursor. According to her, she wants to *bottle me up for her other patients*.

One of the things she asked was where I get my motivation and accountability from. I told her that I'm accountable to myself but as far as support and motivation goes, I proudly nominated reddit. I explained to her /r/loseit, /r/progresspics and /r/fitness. She had never heard of them but upon hearing about it exclaimed that she will for sure pass on these links to her other patients.

Thank you guys for being awesome. 

Regards,

train_subject5967, that dude with the ravishing calves.

 Hey Channing,

You were honestly the **best** thing about Foxcatcher. I say that fully understanding and accepting Steve Carrel's amazing performance. I think you were robbed as far as awards are concerned. You've shown that you can really nail a dramatic performance.

Are we going to see more of Channing in these powerful dramatic roles in the future? 




 Really good article, as a lover of the book this has given me more confidence in the adaptation.

..I see him [Watney] as this very funny but very, very smart guy, which is something I talked to the writer about, Drew[Goddard]. **He described it as a love letter to science**..

This sentence made me happy. 




 Sucks to hear, because that dude can act. He was one of my favourite parts of Reservoir Dogs. 




 **Sugar-Free** Space Jam

FTFY 




 Jesus fucking christ, that was a rollercoaster to read.

I'm glad to see you're on the bandwagon, well done :)

read your labels

This I can totally agree with. It's so important to get a proper gauge for what you're eating.  




 For me it was a mix of ignorance and deception for sure. I was the same as you and equated weight loss with exercise. Sadly that general ignorance is still very much rampant in society.

With all the information all over reddit, I'm down 37 pounds in almost 4 months. I fucking hate how I could let ignorance fuel me so much. 




 This isn't about me, it's about my sister. She married a guy about 4 years ago and had a kid 2 years ago with him.

The thing about his side of the family, is that the mother is a controlling bitch and has my sisters husband under her thumb. Initially when they agreed to get married, they were both living with his mother (lets call her **Attila the Mum**). That was a little dysfunctional since he was well into his 20s. But what ever.

Since they've had the kid though, my sister has been trying to move out and start their own life away from his family. You know, like normal people. But Attila won't allow that.

She has him under her control so much, that he's actually convinced he's not capable of living away from home. This ended up causing a rift where my sister couldn't take it anymore so she gave him the reasonable ultimatum *"We're married, we either move out together or we break up."*

He chose his fucking mother. Unbelievable. Since this split, my sister has been living with my parents temporarily (my parents promoted a healthy attitude towards moving out asap). This whole thing has been beyond awful and now we're getting all of this bullshit where *doctors* that Attila knows have stated that my sister is an unfit mother and that she should be with Attila.

Now that really makes my fucking blood boil, my sister is the most kinda hearted mother I know, she has wanted to work in child care as far as I can remember. 

Long fucking story fucking short. I wish my sister had thought more about marrying and having a child with someone who is still by all accounts - a child. I honestly can't even fathom parents who actively keep their kids from moving out. It's your responsibility to prepare them for the real world you fucking narcissists.

**TL:DR my sister is regretting not giving further scrutiny to her new family before getting married.** 




 Really good points, thanks for that.

But lets say that TWOW comes out before season 6 (here's hoping :D), that means that we won't be spoiled for any TWOW content.

We're still going to have the show spoil the last part of the story as the show will be long finished before ADOS. So while it's good that in delaying TWOW info this season, we have been given a reprieve from spoilers for TWOW. It is just that, a reprieve. We're still going to see the show's adaptation of the series finale :( 




 Blizzard CS for my wow friends.

VicRoads for any of my Australian friends living in Victoria. All traffic accidents are reported near instantly :) 




 I don't necessarily do cheat **days** as much as I do cheat **meals**. This also varies in frequency, could be once a week, could be once a fortnight.

The main thing I reserve cheat days for, is alcohol.

I've been off the booze for almost 4 months and I've only had drinks twice since then. Once for a bucks and once for a friends 30th birthday. I'll only indulge for special occasions.

The next time I'll be drinking is the upcoming weekend. I'm traveling interstate to visit a friend who've I've not seen in months. This is going to be a cheat weekend it seems, at least as far as alcohol is concerned :) 




 Hey guys


So I've been more avid of late to hit the gym, this has consisted of 2-4x 45 minute long cardio sessions per week.

Initially it was just fast walking, but I started adding bouts of jogging here and there and before I knew it, I was doing 2x 5 minute jogs in my 45 minute session. 

The other week I started getting some pain in my ankles and foot arches. I realised the main culprit.

My running shoes.

They were old and most certainly not longer doing their job for me amping up my efforts. I went out and spent $200 on a new pair which were fitted for my and **holy shit** has that made a difference.

The first session back with my new shoes I ran 2x 10 minute jogging without any discomfort at all. I'm now far more comfortable increasing my efforts as time goes on. 

Do yourself a favour and invest the money, it will make a difference :) 




 Thanks for this, as a metric system dude this has always confused me. 




 I lost my virginity on Australia Day, thus I'm a true patriot. 




 Jurassic World premiered this weekend with no other movie doing the same, without that fresh competition it makes sense that it's breaking records. 




 because when The Winds of Winter comes out in 2017

:( 




 The fact that you don't want to be in a relationship right now is only going to be harder to deal with the longer you stay. 




 Nice work man, I was at 285 3 months ago - I'm at 248 now :D

I'm kicking myself I didn't start doing this earlier. 




 Please keep the subreddit simple and without over the top colour.  




 I'm so fucking pumped, the confidence in this film is excellent. 




 A 3rd of my pay check goes into savings every fortnightly pay. That is a sizeable amount plus it gives me (after paying for rent, bills etc) quite a bit of desposible income. What ever is left over the night before my next payday is transfered into savings. I've got quite a good nest egg 




 That's fucking disgusting. Who goes past the knuckle with someone platonic? 




 I don't see how it would be awkward at all, everyone at the gym already ignores each other and does their own thing. How would that be any different if things dont work out?

You would just go back to ignoring each other 




 Anything but satin boxers. Those sweaty fuckers were a representative of my teenage-hood. 




 Man, I hate non sequiturs almost as much as I hate tap dancing tea kettles. 




 The crime is the quality, not the targeted audience : / 




 I'm sad how few of my friends I can get to watch this series. I enjoy the fuck out of it.

That type of meta satire is just too funny. 

I've tried everything guys, I almost got a few mates to join the bandwagon when I showed them the "I fucked a deaf chick" scene with Matt LeBlanc youtube. 




 I literally did it last night. Oh Netflix, you make this so easy,

Regards,

Australia. 




 Me! I'm happy :)

Honestly, I am. I'm at such a stable part of my life. 27, almost saved enough for a house, my career is solid and I have a permanent job doing what I love. 

There were only two things which were actively bothering me. One was my weight and the other was finding myself a lady. These two issues tend to go hand in hand.

I've been working on my weight for the past 3 months, I'm down 16 kgs and I'm working on my fitness.

In a little bit, ill go back into the dating scene with some confidence and find me a lady :)

Please don't respond by saying "finding a girl won't make you happy, blah blah". I am happy, but I would be happier in a relationship. I left my last relationship a while ago because I wanted to be single to focus on my career. I'm done with that, I want to settle down.

 




 The important thing is that you do stuff that the groom would want. If he really doesn't want strippers, don't do it.

We had a bachelor party last month and it was awesome because we catered it around the groom.

We started the morning with drinking while playing a massive game of croquet. After that, we headed to the city for a meal then we pub crawled until dinner them. Then we went back home and ate dinner, then the topless girls turned up and we played old school video games and drank well into the night. 

Honestly, the best part of the day was in the middle where it was just all of us having a great time drinking in the pubs. We were all just celebrating our friend 




 Ok, this has been fucking annoying me for years. Peridically for the past *decade*, I've had the Winneh the Pooh bear theme song stuck in my head, but it only ever happens when I'm about to take a shower. I don't fucking get it, it happens once every month or so, I just open the shower door and suddenly..

**POOH BEAR, WINNEH THE POOH BEAR!!!**

I've not seen an episode since I was 8 years old.

Did I perhaps get molested by Winneh in the shower at 8?  




 whorecrux** 




 Huh? Why is it a waste? The money goes straight into supporting a website that you frequent, for free.

Your question is strange. 




 Lol, the funniest part of them is their customer support. "If you have any questions you can call us on XXX-XXX-XXX or contact us via live chat".

Of course I'm going to use live chat.  




 ayy 




 Its a motivator that the OP likely used often to deal with his weight loss. 

Hypothetical - Lets say the OP has a dog, and walking that dog every day is his personal way to deal with his weight loss. If one day dogs were outlawed and he made a post on /r/loseit talking about how he thinks that the dog removal will affect his loss, would you have a problem with that post?

/r/loseit is totally a place where people can air their grievances and who knows, perhaps someone can point the OP towards something which can work as an alternative to his **dog**.

If he had made a post saying "I'm sad /r/fatpeoplehate was banned because I liked making fun of fatties", then I would be right on board with you. He's just a guy/girl who wants any help he/she can get with their struggles. 




 Fishing out my discarded cigarette butts, carefully pulling the left over tabacco out and rolling a cigarette with it.

 He's a chemist

Edit: Everyone has dual speciality. Watney is a botanist/mechanical engineer.  




 The gym. I just go there to use the treadmill anyway, why not run outside? Fuck I'm stupid.

Also my brazzers accout, the internet is full of free porn. WTH is wrong with me. 




 Because many people on /r/loseit frequent that subreddit to deal with their weight loss.  




 Apparently the shitlords from FPH were spamming there so they set it to private for now. Which sucks, I like that subreddit. 




 The problem time of night is normally around 9om. So what I do is just brush/floss/mouth wash early so that I'm not as tempted to chow down lol 




 Why is everyone circle jerking this anticipation. 




 MYRCELLA NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!



Could Ellara take the role of Darkstar? Probably.
 




 Australian here, I'll go with *yes*. But I'll say it's no where near as much of a deal as it is in American culture. 

Perhaps I'm just in a different crowd, but I think we have more pressure for fitness over bulk 




 I used to be irregular, but after 3 months of healthy living I'm down to 1-2 times a day. Maybe more, if I've had lots of coffee. 




 I have a favourite crappy beer, but it was from my universary days. 

Back then I was living away from home i was only working a part time job. So I could only afford a slab of "Hammer and Tongs" beer. Its a shitty Australian beer which tastes like metal shards, but it's half the price of the standard local beer and just as potent.

Also no one would steal my beer at a party, like ever. 




 Lets start a business to get these men laid.

I guess you could say there is money inceling sex. 




 I'm not using it, but people at /r/loseit swear by it. I primarily use guestimation for my diet. I eat around 1800-2000 calories a day. My dinner is pretty much the same thing, with some variation on the side dishes and since I only eat twice a day - this makes having a consistent caloric input much easier.

My biggest piece of advice is to focus on what you eat, the second you realise that weight loss is 80% diet and 20% exercise, that's when you see how easy it actually is. Eat less to lose fat, exercise to get healthy.

It's also important that the word 'diet' is defined. 'Diet' shouldn't be a temporary thing. It's a change of lifestyle. What you're doing now, you need to do for the rest of your life. So when you make this 'diet' of yours, it's important to not exclude **anything**. Just have less of it.

You love the taste of french fries with your dinner? Then eat them with your dinner, just make sure you allow it into your daily caloric budget. What you'll realise after doing this is that the foods you love are likely caloric gold mines and you didn't even realise it. That has turned me off quite a few of the foods I used to love.

Also, avoid having cheat days. Instead have unplanned cheat *meals*. I do this often and it helps my sanity. Last night I caught up with some friends and had a meal at a resturant, today I'm back at eating normally and my efforts are hardly worsened.

The final thing I would add, is control what you drink. I've been pretty much booze free for the past 3 months and I think that's the biggest assistance I've had. I drink nothing but water (save for a coffee here and there) and that's made a huge difference.

Definitely hang around /r/loseit, /r/progresspics, /r/fitness or if you're like me /r/fatlogic may also help motivate you. Warning, /r/fatlogic isn't for everyone. If you get motivation to keep doing what you're doing then it's good, if you end up feeling like shit, it's probably not for you.

 




 I'm down 35 lbs as of this morning, I'm in the same boat - but I've only really had one person notice my efforts. 

The thing is that I had a huge amount of weight to lose (started at 285) so much of the weight I have lost is likely visceral fat which obviously doesn't show on the outside. I'm down 3 belt buckles and 2 shirt sizes though :)

 but I'm already starting to feel better

This is the main point, I feel amazing. I get solid sleep every night. I don't sweat as much anymore and aside from some hunger (extremely manageable) I have all the energy in the world. 




 Thanks friend, how much have you lost?

My pictures are hidden in my porn folder. 




  A black man cat**,** called me the other day. 

I totally read this sentence with a comma in a strange place.
 




 Australia, most of us live on the fucking coasts. Most of the deadly shit is no where near civilisation. Or if it is (spiders and snakes) they're so skittish that you're never really in danger. 




 I always go to the doctors office right after work and since I wear the same thing everyday, I just take my shoes off and remove my keys, wallet and phone. Ez. It's not the number which is important, it's the number between the two numbers which is important. 




 Cunts fucked 




 A good friend of mine fell asleep while we were watching Devils Advocate for the first time. During the fucked up part with the baby, he sat up, looked at me and said something in Croatian then went back to sleep. Trust me, Croatian sounds demonic.

Fucked me up. 




 Exactly. I do draw the line with drawing parallels when the person tries to predict what will happen based on these parallels. I don't think GRRM is the type of writer who would make a habit out of doing that. 




 As someone who grew up playing Fantasy and not really finding 40k any fun - I know what you mean. 




 I've been playing competitive 8-ball pool for the past 9 years. I love the shit out of it. 

I had always loved the game, my dad used to play snooker back in the 80s and he taught my brother and I the basics when we were in our early teens.

The second I hit 18, my brother and I joined a pool club and have been playing ever since. While my brother has fallen out of love with it, I'm still intensely passionate about it and could play for days.

If there is a pool table at a party or pub, i'll be there shootin. I don't hold back, no matter how good or shit you're :) 




 Washed my mouth out with soap when I said a curse word. Literally, I'm talking getting a flannel, rubbing soap on it and going to town on my teeth. I never learned my cunt fucking lesson.

More generally, I was grounded a lot in highschool. 




 "Oh man, this freshly cooked dinner is way too hot. I'll need to let it sit for 10 minutes..." 




 "Your wisdom tooth is now removed, here are your antibiotics." 




 [something](http://www.something.com/) 




 Does anyone remember Liero? 

God I loved that game. 




 As someone who has been losing weight for the past 3 months, I've not whispered a single syllable on Facebook about my efforts. Once I reach my goal weight, I'll post up a before and after picture but then I'll never mention it again on there. People don't want to be preached at constantly.

 




 It's kinda the same in Australia. When I had my first doctors visit when I started losing weight, she asked what my goal weight was and I asked her what her opinion was for it. She just kind of sighed and said that nowdays it's difficult to say what the correct weight should be for anyone since the average weight of someone average height is so large.

There is no real go-to figure for what the ideal weight is anymore. 




 Eat, sleep, fuck, shit, repeat. 




 Well done my Australian brethren, keep it up 




 Is this an American culture thing? I can't even fathom my family being anything but supportive. Mum and dad know that I need to get my weight under control and have been nothing but giddy with my achievements. Not only that, my mum has started to drop some weight herself :)

Damn crabs in that damn bucket.

Perhaps explain your goals to them? It may help if they know that you have a certain number you're working towards. I think they might be concerned about you having an ED 




 Thank you for your sacrifice. 




 Doesn't mean I don't like the view of the glorious upboats. 




 Thats almost one third of my total for today (1200) for the next 2 hours

See that's awesome that you get the context of the calories. I find it's so much easier to deny myself an ice cold beer because I know that 180 calories will need to be reduced from somewhere in my food budget to allow for it. 




 He's talking about the books. The show is a different beast. They can revive the Nights King if they want. GRRM probably just has a nameless and faceless group of others leading the attack in the books. 




 He's not half as awesome as his brother Garlan, let's face it. 




 Thanks for the internet points. 









 I'm sorry to the people who do this, because I know there is quite a bit of work that goes into it.

....But I don't really like it when people make large posts which show similarities between events in the books and events in other fiction. Cool, so you see a Hamlet reference? I don't really find that interesting or relevant : /

I just skip over it. 




 Jesus christ, this.

These forums are nigh unreadable after any form of rape occurs on the show. If you're triggered by such horrible things, **DON'T WATCH THE FUCKING SHOW**.

It really is that simple, the show hasn't gotten more brutal. Remember in the first episode we went from brother sister incest to child murder in like 30 seconds. 




 We're fucking not. That's the damn answer. The internet over reacts CONSTANTLY.

Its fucking fiction people, not only that, it's fiction which is meant to be harsh. I don't get the people who literally screaming IRL.  




 I knew a dude who would literally just get a footlong chicken fillet and tasty cheese on white bread. It wasn't for health reasons, he just doesn't like things in general apparently. 




 The upside is that you can wear your old hoodie as a dress and then save some money on new pants. 




 Pretty much impossible, definitely unhealthy.

Some snap calculations to prove it. To lose 15 pounds in 3 weeks (15*3500)/21 you would need to have a deficit of 2500 calories per day. Meaning you would need to eat 2500 less than your daily expenditure. After putting your information into a TDEE calculator, even with setting it to "intense exercise every day" your expenditure is 2811, so you'd have to eat only 311 calories a day. Which is a great way to kill yourself.

I did this math just to give you context for how weight loss works. Set realistic goals :) 




 A clever play on words. I don't care how tasteless the context is or who recites it. I will laugh and I will probably hate myself for doing so. 




 And GRRM has stated that too, I don't have the sauce but there was an article a while back where he was asked a bunch of "who would win" scenarios with LOTR vs ASOIAF characters. One of the matches was 1 unsullied vs 1 Urukai, GRRM basically stated that unsullied were strong in numbers, not for single combat.

**Edit [found the article](http://www.avclub.com/article/watch-george-rr-martin-debate-emgame-of-thronesem--103349)** 




 I would actually recommend listening to the audio book, the narrator does an incredible job with the voices and it helps with the immersion :) 




 Because even when they're in packs of 10~ they don't seem to utilise this formation fighting. It's stupid. While we're here - why do they seem to feel pain in the show? That is a selling point of them, that they take medicine to phase out all pain.

We know in the books, Dany wants them to stop taking it but they don't really touch on it in the show. 




 Sure, 1v1 that's the case. Then why don't they form up and utilise tight formations like phalanxes? You see them all just kinda spread out with spears drawn. They constantly get out flanked and destroyed by nobles with daggers. 




 Oh right, in the mean time did you keep drinking lots of water? 




 I can't be the only one who hated Patchface with a passion, right?

Perhaps it's because Roy Dotrice (while an excellent narrator) has a grating voice for him. 




 I've stopped caring, the unsullied are basically useless in the show 




 and it subsides naturally after several days? 




 Christ reddit is overreacting to this. I've read the damn book and I understand why some are frustrated. But to the non readers, it's just a fucking trailer. Without context many of these 'spoiler' moments are just moments.

None of my friends know anything about what will happen. 




 Mornin' Angle. 




 I think one of the problems is that abrupt switch of trailer style in the early 00s, from "cheesy fourth wall voice over guy" to "edited spoken word from the movie".

By doing this, you're basically forcing the movie to show its cards more. 




 Thats the problem, I don't think it's anymore spoilery than any other trailer.

I've read the novel, so I saw shit loads of stuff in there which is a spoiler **only because I know the context**. I've spoken with several mates who've not read it and they have no idea what will happen. 




 I'm way ahead of you ;)

My diet can keep me covered for another 20 pounds :) 




 I love the enthusiasm! Let your motivation turn into discipline over time!

Something I will add is to remind you that weight loss is mostly due to diet. So if you feel that exercise 5 days a week is too much, don't burn yourself out over it. Stay on top of what you eat and exercise as much as you can handle! 




 Yikes, glad you're ok.

This is something I have to worry about. My paternal grand father died of a heart attack at 38 and his son (my paternal uncle) survived a heart attack  at 38. I'm 27 at the moment and no way am I going to let myself go through that with them. 




 I'm 3 months in and while I've been doing cardio, I've been holding off from doing any strength training till I lost more.

I did my first bout with strength training on the weekend and I had no idea how weak I was. Pushups, situps, planking, squats and lunges. They all showed me how unfit I was haha

But I think it's important to start right away. 

If you're like me, then you're currently kicking yourself that you didn't start losing weight earlier. It's the exact same with exercise. I don't want to be at my ideal weight months from now and think "Why didn't I start training sooner? I've lost months of progression".
