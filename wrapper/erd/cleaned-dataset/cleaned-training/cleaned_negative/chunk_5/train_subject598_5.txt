 I have a similar problem but its not related to anyones attention span.  Most people just care more about being right than they care about having an honest dialog.  Someone who cares about intellectual honesty or participates in the argument to develop a more complete understanding of an issue will always be at a strategic disadvantage when arguing with someone that just wants to win.

 I think this is right. In an honest discussion you have to be ready to be convinced. If you believe you have unique access to the capital "t" Truth  you are really just a salesman and do a disservice to yourself, the other party and the dialog itself. 




 That's one of my favorite responses from conservatives. "It was the national SOCIALIST party!" yeah and North Korea is technically the Democratic People's Republic of Korea...  




 this exact thing happened to me a few years ago. Bricks were indeed shat 









 I came here to post this

 "Wherever you find injustice, the proper form of politeness is attack." -- [T-Bone Slim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Bone_Slim) 




 I was told once that Tao te Ching can be understood in 3 distinct ways.  1. how to be a Taoist sage 2. As how to be a good and just ruler 3. How to live a virtuous life.   




 don't forget Chuang Tzu (Zhuangzi / Zhuang Zhou). Probably a close #2 in terms of importance to the tradition.  A little heavier than the Tao te Ching but but the parables can be helpful is fleshing out some of the more abstract concepts that students sometimes have trouble grasping.

 Blackalicious - Blazin Arrow. Didnt just open the door to the hip-hop universe, it completely changed how i thought about what makes something "good." 




 I use Evernote to catalog what I feel are useful contributions to arguments I find interesting.  Counter arguments to economic libertarianism and Austrian econ are some of my favorites.  Here are a few that stuck out as I browsed. 

These are all going to be anti-Austrian for the most part. Mises.org should give you enough material for where the Austrians stand from their prospective.

 I wonder if his wife knows what a beard is 









 Buy all the way.  Hes been one of the better 2 way forwards in hockey for a long time, Its good to see him get some recognition.  The Blues need to get him re-signed, hes in a contract year. 




 A savior should have ripped abs 




 if you use an out of country VPN or a service like AdFreetime to sign up its only 100 a instead of 150. I dont have cable so Adfreetime has been clutch for watching blues games in market. 




 take it back 




 I'm here and this place is empty. Smallest crowd ive seen in a while 




 First, let me just say that Im one of those people who tries to listen to an album 3 or 4 times from beginning to end before I decide what I think about it. Some of my favorite albums I didn't even like on my first listen. So, this may be a little premature since Ive only gotten through it a couple of times, but Im slightly underwhelmed. 

If Deltron 3030 is just a colab between Dan the Automator, Kid Koala, and Del then it an adequate to good follow up. In my mind, Deltron 3030 was one of the best concept albums of all time in any genre. Event 2 is missing that epic future apocalypse sound that characterized the first record.  

Are my expectations so high that I cant help but be let down? What do you guys think of it so far?
 




 I used to work with a guy at a restaurant who would take food to the back and finish it but only if the food had belonged to a girl and only if he would have made out with her. 




 SUCSHESH! 




 he had reached the point of no return
