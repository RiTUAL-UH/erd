 There was some kind of promising [news](http://www.sciencealert.com.au/news/20141706-25695.html) on this recently. 




 What's equally terrifying is the dental bill afterwards. 














 It wouldn't have been a problem if the reporter was from a real state like New England. 




 Also, it's Russia. [This](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iv55gja6ulI/U8O0eaeYJmI/AAAAAAAAEls/X8OgFJyYKsE/s1600/hail.gif) can happen at any time. 




  What year is this, 1975?

I said almost exactly the same thing when watching it. It was back to the days before we knew the dangers associated with this kind of thing. 




 [Here's a little more background on this fella.](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2662232/Football-fan-Carl-Wenz-caught-apparently-exchanging-phone-numbers-pretty-Brazilian.html) 














 Be nice to brazilans, fellow redditors. This is beyond heartreaking for them. Source: married to one. 




 Anecdotally, it seems a lot of Southeast Asians in general are fans of Germany in the WC. It's an odd thing but hey, whatever floats your boat. 









 Its Muphry's law. FTFY 









 The best bit:

 the player Luis Surez is prohibited from entering the confines of any stadium during the period of the ban

 Even better, you can **watch** Lethal Weapon on said smartphone. 




 At least the Spain-Australia game can be a contest now that Tim Cahill's suspended. 




 This information is a week old and is not news to anyone who has been following the story of the WC in the slightest. Since then things have gone suprisingly well, and I'm one who suspected it *could* have been a complete disaster. It's important to have some perspective on this. There's plenty of that well down among the comments at the moment. 




 Redditor at the World Cup: let's head to the beach, have a caipirinha, and wait for all of this to blow over. 




 [For those that missed the reference.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/26h0hl/youre_sent_to_brazil_with_5000000_cash_30_clowns/) 




 Deus Ex Human Revolution also needs a shout out ITT. The ambient music in Detroit and Hengsha is great. 









 *"I should buy a boat."* 









 Why wasn't it called a strike? 









 A sequel. 




 Alexander the Great said that this size was "the amount of wine needed by one man in one sitting to hear the voices of the gods." [Source](http://www.supplewine.com/wine101/wine-bottle-sizes/)

 PK Subban says hi. 














 [Right here.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R1n7pf_riE) South Koreans apparently. 


































 No critique necessary. 














 What I found most surprising was the hippopotamus, they kill 500 each year, more than the shark, wolf and lion combined. 




 [Perfect time to bring out this instant classic.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUY6lDja-DE) 




 [This guy](http://www.jimmo.org/hippopotamus-milk-is-not-pink/) says hippo milk is NOT pink. Field research is required. 














 [Paper here.](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v7/n3/full/ngeo2098.html) 




 If the first thing you do after arming a grenade is put it in your mouth, you're gonna have a bad time. 














 It also has grappling hooks. [This article](http://www.nature.com/news/female-insect-uses-spiky-penis-to-take-charge-1.15064) from Nature includes this gruesome tidbit:

 When researchers tried to pull apart two mating insects, the female was gripping so tightly that the male was accidentally ripped in half, leaving his genitalia still attached to the female.

 




 It also depends on the amount wanted. 25 grams of the L-glucose is $1565, way less than 25 times the price of 1 gram. For these amounts the "50% more expensive" stat will be more accurate. 




 Seems about right. You can buy a gram of L-glucose [here](http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/sigma/g5500?lang=en region=US) for $84.90. Gold is currently $42 a gram, so yeah at least 50% more than gold by weight.

Google tells me that there are 39 grams of sugar in a can of coke, so a can of left handed coke would cost over $3300.


^(edit: to all those pointing out that 84 is 100% more than 42: this post is intended as a back-of-the-envelope sanity check on the information in the post title. Hence "at least". Many factors can influence the relative costs, including the amount and source of L-glucose, as has been pointed out in comments.) 




 I'm noticing a distinct lack of empty Doritos packets and beer cans. 









 Pakistan and India are still in the Commonwealth. 




 I was really surprised at this but [it is true](http://www.aboutmyvote.co.uk/who_can_register_to_vote.aspx):

 You can register to vote if you are: 16 years old or over and a British citizen or an Irish, qualifying Commonwealth or European Union citizen who is resident in the UK

They have to be a **resident** of the UK though. 




 Well, they *are* the champions. 




 They've got more chance of summoning a Daedra. 




  During the trip, Koepcke could not sleep at night due to numerous insect bites, which became infected. After nine days, several spent floating downstream, she found a boat moored near a shelter, where she found the boat's motor and fuel tank. Relying again on her father's advice, Koepcke poured gasoline on her wounds, which succeeded in removing thirty-five maggots from one arm

Thanks Dad. 




 Smart family that one. The other daughter [Eve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%88ve_Curie) is the only one not to get a Nobel Prize, but she did write the best known biography of her mother and won the National Book Award, and her husband happened to pick up the Nobel Peace Prize.  




 Probably the result of an Occupy Greenland movement. 




 It's a day-night cycle. 




 There are some great photos of abandoned buildings on this island [here](http://kingstonlounge.blogspot.ca/2008/08/hart-island.html). Also, google the nearby North Brother Island for a creepy abandoned hospital, if you like that kind of thing. 




 In Australia they even call some seafood "bugs". [Moreton Bay Bugs, Balmain Bugs etc.](http://www.sydneyfishmarket.com.au/FISHline/SpeciesInfo/Bugs/tabid/210/Default.aspx) 




 A corn cob *hanging on a string for re-use*, no less. Makes you appreciate the little things we take for granted. 




 Note to amateur chemists: you don't need to put the silly putty in alcohol for it to become flammable, in case OP's post title confused you as it did me. 




 I imagine similar reactions will occur in North Korea one day, when someone denounces the Kim dynasty. 




 The story has since been denied by Chinese spokesman Rong Ping.

^(edit: thanks so much!)
