 It seems like vampires would have the ability to give people back the memories theyve blocked I dont like that Hoyt didnt get to remember he and Jasons youth together, but then he seems more confident then he did before. Hmm

And why make it seem as though Bill was possibly turning into a Human again?

Why make Eric interesting and compassionate to others; not only to those hes in love with or made, in the last two episodes more than the whole series?

That Bridgette bitch had 0 right to be angry with Hoyt because the moment she set eyes on Jason her eyes bugged the fuck out and she was mind fucking him the whole time. And she cheated? Thats her biggest darkest secret? She cheated on a test? For a biologist she lacked a lot of depth. Jason deserved better.

And while I despise Sarah Newlin she was quite a character, Im disappointed with what they did with her, I wish Pam would have taken her up on her offer and then opened a vampire girl brothel or something. I think Sarah would have just changed her identity again and loved her new life.

Glad Arlene still had her new man though!

Favorite part of the whole series: When Eric finally gave a piece to Ginger 
























 nice gifs 




 it was awesomeeeeee!!! 




 In my opionion not every character needs to have a romantic side...some just need to be `doers`..or maybe that`s the way the writers wanted to build daryl`s character, so that later we will be happy when he gets involved with someone (female or not) 









 Nice! Maybe I`ll be scared at first..but I`ll appreciate it
