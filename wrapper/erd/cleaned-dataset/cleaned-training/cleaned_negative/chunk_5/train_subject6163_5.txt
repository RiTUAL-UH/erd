 cheers man, I will do just that 




 given travel, hotel, ticket, food, beer etc... I would estimate it costs me about that much ($800) per park. Getting to visit all the parks though, priceless... 




 well, the three best beers were goose island at target field, leinenkrugel in milwaukee and it was 103 in texas, so while I don't remember what I drank, it was pretty damn tasty at the time!
