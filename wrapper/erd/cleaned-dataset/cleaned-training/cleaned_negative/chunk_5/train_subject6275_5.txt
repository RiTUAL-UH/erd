 Thanks for the suggestion love! I have tried that before...last time didn't go so red hot. 

I also suffer from sleep paralysis and there was actually a time I was having nightmare, I told myself it was all just a dream and managed to wake myself up, only problem was...I couldn't move. 

I have also suffered from this since I was little, but it very rarely happens. The first time it happened to me I was so scared because my eyes were open in my pitch black room, the only thing I could move was my pinky on my left hand.

And being a little brat still I was convince that I must be dying and cried my eyes out silently because I couldn't even make a sound. Finally passed back out from crying and woke up the next day fine.

I don't freak out as bad anymore, but sometimes I get this overwhelming feeling that something bad is going to happen, which I hear is pretty common for people suffering from it.

Which makes sense because not being able to move or make a sound...trapped in your body. Ugh...! Gives me the willies!
