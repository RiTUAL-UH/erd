 Beautifully put! I definitely think that I am going to wait three years! 




 Thanks! 
I am starting to see that many, experienced teachers are suggesting waiting until year 3.
I want to be the best teacher for my kids, as soon as I can. 




 Thanks! 
I am just worried that the workload might be a little too much.
