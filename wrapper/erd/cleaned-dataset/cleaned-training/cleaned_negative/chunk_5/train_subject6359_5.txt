 You could have a separate LaFerrari for each day of the week with that kind of cash. Assuming Ferrari would allow it. 




 This is why I always poo before driving. Takes about 4 seconds off my sprint time and adds about 20mpgs. On your marks, get set, science. 




 You might like this [v12 Fiat 500](https://youtu.be/GH2uwjk3fqM). If you look at related videos you can find the build process. I couldn't help but chuckle at the popup spoiler. 




 Because the two people trying to convince everyone that this is a ripoff are doing so based on an imgur link and refusing to provide a link to the original artists webpage. 




 He is a modern day Franz Liszt. Taking it to 11 and beyond. I bet all the bitches be swooning over his intellect. 




 If you look close you can see soft tissue. Little tentacles. Definitely still alive I'd say. 




 A bivalve! My roommate had one in his tank back when it was FOWLR. He was so proud of it. It was surprisingly active always moving to a new spot every couple days. 




 Gives new meaning to the phrase "Happy as a pig in a Tupperware thing of water" 




 Looks like its straight out of Hotrod or Napoleon Dynamite 




 Woah woah just because she has feathers on her head you assume she meant native american? As someone who is easily offended, I am offended. 




 HEY GUYS WE GOT A PEDO OVER HERE 




 Side hustle: president of mars 




 I was half expecting it to just come exploding out of the newspaper 




 You can tell just from the style that it isn't going to be funny 




 A minute thirty of my life for 2 mini revs. 




 Everyone was thinking it but its not socially acceptable to say 




 I like how the bmer (and that poorly timed white truck) is the only thing in the entire photo that's in focus. 




 Its all like (o_o  ) 




 That black bottom panel accents its hips so well 









 Oh I thought your mother produced you by binary fission. 




 Ambien. Probably more than once 




 He can talk to animals. I hear he sips Stella with silverbacks when he's bored 




 Those prefreckles tho 




 I don't know why but I absolutely love that pointy little ducktail on the huracans butt 




 (  _) 




 My name is Ra. Can confirm I wouldn't reincarnate those fucks. 




 Its too small for 1 let alone 2. 




 Cats just don't appreciate awd 




 [Pacuman?](http://i.imgur.com/2D6xUuU.gif) 




 One theory says it was sort of like a university. Maybe they just didn't need it anymore 




 [Probably this](http://imgur.com/DXRdukO) 




 I can't count that high but I agree 




 Was this like 2 days ago? I had an early exam in the burbs and the fog was absolutely bananas. 




 The money funds ecological and anti-poaching programs too. Or at least thats what they say. 




 I love fish's dopey faces. None compare to a good ol fashioned lawnmower blenny though. 




 Thats only true if the car is completely submerged. I can't tell of the front window was open but if it was, the pressure would equalize and you'd be able to open the back door.  




 Id remove the blue background ASAP but I like this! Its weirdly charming. Especially if it had some tiny shrimp  




 I spotted a pretty rare Porsche the other day (Chicago) and some German guy was like oh yeah everyone's bringing those out now that its warming up. But now the tables have turned. 




 I thought so too but I've never seen one that color and without the big front eyes 




 He was holding his front legs up like antennae. Brown body with white hairs so he looked matte white 









 I consider myself a connoisseur of quisine so maybe I can help you out. The first is shrimp eggs. The second is some kind of blackened fish? The third is ummm... a brown... loaf. Yes, a brown loaf with green stuff on it. And the fourth is a bunch of vegetables in like a broth or something. 




 Hydroids 




 I actually posted this here earlier and it got downvoted. I'm glad it ended up here regardless because IMO its gold 




 Hey i totally agree. anyone with artistic skills can do realism from a reference photo. It takes creativity and originality to do design without being cliche. I actually like those a lot. 









 You have a cool life 




 A tin of shisha, hopefully 




 Jewel has handles of vodka for $11. FULL HANDLES. For a chronically stressed, almost broke medical student this is a dream come true. 




 Once you get the hang of it they're actually really precise. I used to use mine to bother my dog. Used to. 




 There are a couple other creepy ones on my [website](http://www.studioralu.com) if that's what you're into

 I'd take my kids the fuck to school in that. I like it a lot. 




 I caught one disappearing around the corner in the garage I park in when I go to the city. Not sure if it was a 6 or an 8 but that thing sounds like a choir of snarling cat-angels. Almost brought tears to my eyes. 




 I'm a brofessor. I drink beers and pretend I know what im talking about 




 That exhaust. I bet it sounds mean 




 I saw your post in r/new and thought I was going crazy for a minute 




 Yeah Da Vinci was a no good lousy imitator too. All he did was copy Mona Lisa's face with oil paints.  




 Warp me in dude its miserable here in Chicago today. 









 Actually I'm pretty sure its called an "and thingy" 




 That is disturbing, Kate. I wonder what the science behind it is 




 reliable minotaur

My friend hired a minotaur without bothering to check its references first. Within a week, a burglar broke in and stole his adamantine tunic. Was a family heirloom too. Do your homework folks. 




 Seen one in my Chicagoland neighborhood. Black with gold calipers ( o  o ) 




 Try an osteopath for musculoskeletal stuff. Their practice revolves around it. 




 Bro I appreciate this joke twice as much as you and that's when I'm not even trying. 




 I'd eat so many m ms with that bad boy. Not even because I'm hungry but just because its cool. 




 Friends, i fear OP is kill. 




 A 




 Everything is a penis if you look with your heart 




 Yesss I'm 20 min from bolingbrook! I'm gonna go find a car I like and tell strangers that I own it. 




 [Are you *salty* about it?](http://i.imgur.com/LSxJe.png) 




 Not to mention those incomparable interiors ( o . o ) 




 Do you not realize that YOURE a shitty enthusiast? There is nothing wrong with driving a Camry or a corolla. They're sensibly priced and fairly reliable.  




 True that. My first car was a shitty 95 integra and my second was a pretty nice 2005 TL. The integra was a blast because I always felt like I could die at any minute. The TL was a bit boring in comparison. 




 Looks like its past someone's bedtime 




 Having a car that you think looks like crap is awesome. You can park anywhere you want, drive carefree, and leave it on the street without worrying about teenagers fucking with it. I miss my beat up 95 integra sometimes. 




 Constricted 




 How dare you post Stlenhag without personally alerting me. You knew he was my favorite. 




 If this car is legal then why are the boner police arresting me just for looking at it? 




 Yeah the blue squiggles one was weirdly satisfying. OP should title it "toothpaste thingies" 




 That goddamn sacrotuberous ligament 




 Also interesting: your fingers have no muscle in them. Flexors and extensors are all the way in the forearm and side-to-side-ers are in the hand. 




 Dissecting the hand and foot was a pain in the ass but not as big a pain in the ass as dissecting the ass. 




 dad you're drunk 




 If I was in a room with Adam Levine, Hitler and Satan and I had a gun with 2 bullets I'd shoot Adam Levine twice 




 He's going through and rating everyone less than a 5 and getting downvotes every time 




 Inspired by True Detective 




 $20 and my firstborn 




 Probably woahdude or imaginarymonsters 




 Absolutely! Check out my website at www.train_subject6359.com. all my work + email address is on there 




 He is awesome. I wish I could afford oils and just blatantly rip off some of his haha 




 Shopped. I can tell by the pixels. Right guys? 




 OP neglected to include a picture of him creating the universe. /r/karmaconspiracy 




 hey! I don't have a gallery. im in school so I don't have the time or money to really set anything up. glad you like it though :) 




 it's a joke 




 I had one, also last night, that a rat was trying to burrow into my stomach and as hard as I tried I couldn't get away. Shit hurt so bad. Now you know where your bred rats are going. 









 I clicked it and then switched tabs and at first an Oreos jingle came on and I was like "what the hell is wrong with this guy." But you're right the music does go pretty well! 




 ahahah i love it!
