 "Chris was just one of many Navy SEAL snipers who were getting **huge numbers of kills**," Lechner said. "He was part of a large effort." 









 Who Helped Kill 1,626 People

I guess that makes him 10X the "hero" that Chris Kyle was... 




 For those of you who don't know, Gov. Hickenlooper [made his fortune in the liquor industry](http://www.wynkoop.com/brewery/). 




 Even if true, why would you admit to killing that many human beings?  What a barbaric political class we have. 




 Isn't that what [George W. Bush said](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/oct/07/iraq.usa) too? 




 "Here is the sum and substance, folks.  Chris Kyle killed bad guys so that good guys could live." 




 Then I won't be part of yours... 




 "[Chris] was not a hate-filled person. **He was just a man doing his job**. There were people who were going to kill his brothers **or Iraqi civilians**, and he had a choice to make."

His "job" was killing Iraqis, including civilians.  And she seriously compares her husband to Mother Theresa?

I havent noticed much of [the criticism], but I think that **even Mother Teresa can be criticized by somebody**, somewhere, doing it just wanting to spread their own hatred. 




 He sure has earned that Nobel Peace Prize... 




 When we elected Barack Obama. 




 I'm sure Obama will lead by example and stop his wars and drone attacks... 




 So you're denying that you are Gary (?), the guy who always wrote similar comments every time I posted a death notice of a soldier in Iraq? 




 Ahhh, my favorite troll.  It's been so long that I can't even remember your prior reddit IDs. 




 Rand Paul, Muslim hater.  He has to be deliberately trying to destroy Ron's legacy. 




 But I thought the wars were over? 




 French involvement in [2011 Libyan War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_military_intervention_in_Libya)

French involvement in [current Syrian War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_involvement_in_the_Syrian_Civil_War)

French involvement in [current war on ISIS](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/19/world/europe/leader-vows-french-role-in-airstrikes-on-isis-in-iraq.html?_r=0)

French involvement in [current wars in Mali and elsewhere in Africa](http://www.newsweek.com/2014/11/07/france-slowly-reclaiming-its-old-african-empire-280635.html)

When governments engage in mass murder around the globe, the victims or their sympathizers will inevitably retaliate against the perceived aggressor.  Even a self-described "conservative" should be able to understand that logic. 




 Why don't you listen to the entire video?  France has been subjected to terrorism for decades because of their policies in Algeria and elsewhere.  And, please, you're a self-identified "conservative," what do you know about anything?  The "fucking tard" is the guy you looked at this morning in the bathroom mirror.

BTW, France [did participate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op%C3%A9ration_Daguet) in a war against Iraq. 




 Morrison said Ramirez dropped his left hand to his side  out of the officers view  and **started to jiggle it up and down**.

I knew in that moment, which later was determined to be untrue, but I knew in that moment that he was reaching for a gun, Morrison said. I couldnt take that riskI wanted to see my son grow up.
 




 How can they not be trained after 14 years? 




 Note that he references the notorious RP hater James Kirchick. 




 In a Pattonesque way, Bernanke said he found dealing with the crisis incredibly stimulating because he was able to draw on a lifetime of academic study about the causes of the Great Depression and how to avoid another one. **I feel that the work I did as a academic paid off and that I was able to use that to help solved these problems,** he said. Thats very satisfying, though its not an experience I would voluntarily repeat. 




 "Warmongering is not only unproductive but it places the nation in the middle of a collision course between warring imperialist nations. If they badly want those bases, finance it out of their paychecks but not ours." 




 One of my favorite Presidents.

There are no, and never will be, any "good Presidents." 




 Right now, we only have one side of the story.  When I watched the video, I couldn't tell whether the guy was pointing a gun or just pointing.  I think we need to wait to see if what the police are saying is actually true before we accept their statements as fact. 




 Seems like we get a piece like this every year or so.  Of course, Bloomberg neglects to state that RP has been buying gold since it was $35/oz. 




 Never loses his humanity?

He turns out to be the best marksman in Iraq, serving four tours and becoming known as the most lethal sniper in American history, with **166 confirmed kills**. He is so unstoppable a killer that opposing Iraqi forces call him **The Devil of Ramadi** and offer a massive reward for his death. 




 And why didn't they add "mentally ill?"

**Hamilton had a history of paranoid schizophrenia**, and Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn said in October that Manney violated policy in dealing with the mentally ill by instigating a physical confrontation with Hamilton and coming up behind him. 




 I could have sworn that Obama said there would be no grounds troops in Iraq.  Oh, that's right, he did:

 I am not sorry that President Obama has ordered drone strikes on hundreds of terrorist suspects hiding in Pakistan, Yemen and other places. **I am not sorry he has done so despite the fact that the strikes inevitably have killed hundreds and perhaps thousands of their associates, many of whom were either innocent of wrongdoing or had committed no crime** deserving of death from 30,000 feet. This is the nature of war. 




 This is an original article from Salon.com; it's not rehosted content. 




 Wow, what a great comment.  I'm assuming you're a teenager, so I'll give you a pass this one time. 




 "Political sniping?"  Actually, I agree with you, both parties are equally culpable. 




 Oops.. 




 Nice comment.  Thanks! 




 Opening on Jesus's birthday.  I wonder who picked that date? 




 But Ron Paul is a decent man, his son is not. 




 I feel so sorry for Ron.  What a disgrace. 




 Great comment.  Thanks! 




  What do they do with our young people? They send them all around the world, getting involved in wars and telling them they have to have democratic elections, he told RT. But here at home, we dont have true Democracy. We have a monopoly of ideas that is controlled by the leaders of two parties. And they call it two parties, but its really one philosophy.  




 Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a federal law in 2013 that bans the propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations to minors," only a few months after the iPhone monument was installed. Putin has since argued that the law is not discriminatory and is intended only to keep children safe. 




 This is the actual headline: U.S.: "**Palestinian**-American minor killed by Israeli military"

Why add the qualifier?  Does that make it okay for the Israelis to kill a kid?
 




 Awesome comment.  Thanks! 




 "I would think shed be pretty average, pretty mediocre, pretty much for war," Paul added, when asked what kind of president he thought Clinton would be. "I dont think she would provide any change whatsoever in a positive sense." 




 U-S-A! U-S-A! U-S-A! 




 This appears to be an original story on Raw Story.  I don't understand why it was removed. 




 This was the best Ron Paul ad of 2011-2012. 




 Was his plan to destroy his father's legacy? 




 The United States is providing logistics and operational support, including hundreds of thousands of units of personal protective equipment, mobile labs, water treatment units, disinfectant, basic supplies and food assistance, he said. **If Congress approves the additional funding, it will bring the U.S. total commitment to over $250 million.** 




 Rand Paul is Satan.  What a murderous lunatic. 




 No offense, but I think that's the stupidest comment I have ever read on reddit. 




 I have issues with both. 




 What's he supposed to do?  How 'bout he stops killing men, women and children who have never, nor ever could, threaten The Homeland?  Do you even remember that Obama was first elected because the American people perceived him as the Peace Candidate?  Or, that he's a Nobel Peace Prize winner? 




 Red alert? 




 Says the fella who uses robots to kill women and children across the globe 




 The American government today conducts targeted killings outside of internationally recognized theaters of conflict against folks **believed to be** terrorists. I support that. 




 "We sincerely regret the loss of the lives and injury to innocent Afghan civilians caused by the insurgents in this tragic incident." NATO said in a statement to The Associated Press. 




 Behind the scenes, however, **the U.S. factories that produce Hellfire missiles began "working seven days a week in order to meet the need and push them out to Iraq,"** a senior administration official said. 




 Or, America will kill people to prevent people from possibly being killed. 




 I'd rather have him twiddling his thumbs than [killing Afghan children](http://news.antiwar.com/2014/08/06/us-led-airstrike-kills-afghan-civilians/), but hey, that's just me. 




 You try to help the people with their suffering, the doctor said recently in his Gaza City living room, lined with psychology textbooks. Its totally different when you have the same experience. You lose six from your family  three brothers, your mom, one of your nephews, your sister-in-law. Its really  he paused, red-eyed  unexpected. 




 What a frightening headline. 




 Paul's son, Sen. Rand Paul, has also been an outspoken critic of NSA surveillance but has stopped short of saying that Snowden deserves clemency, though he has publicly advocated a lighter sentence than life in prison. 




 The freshman Kentucky senator has long complained its an unfair knock, and **an unfair guilt by association situation with his father, former Rep. Ron Paul.**

But Mike says the senator is planning a high-profile pitch at the National Defense University this fall to address his critics, and attempt to reposition himself on the foreign policy spectrum.

Hes going to argue that hes smack in the middle - the same place that George H.W. Bush was, that Reagan was, and that Ike was, said Allen. 




 Wouldn't you love to be her husband? 




 Webbs latest allegations and the other new evidence in the matter could also have implications for the Texas governor, Rick Perry, a strong supporter of the death penalty and a possible Republican presidential candidate.

In 2004, Perry refused to temporarily stay Willinghams execution despite the report of a leading forensic expert that sharply disputed the finding of arson by a Texas deputy fire marshal. Perrys administration has also repeatedly undercut the authority of a state Forensic Science Commission, which agreed that the arson finding relied on flawed analysis. Defending his handling of the case in 2009, the governor declared that Willingham was a monster. 




 Bill Clinton was responsible for the death of [500,000 children](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4PgpbQfxgo) in Iraq.  Do you honestly believe that he gave a sh*t about 300 civilians in Afghanistan? 




 What's with these [major universities](http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2011/01/18/professor-mcchrystal/) hiring murderers and war criminals? 




 Great comment.  Thanks 




 So there are three factions?  The rebels, the government and the extremists? 




 Go to the Stasi headquarters museum.  You can visit Erich Mielke's office which looks exactly as it did in 1989. 




 "Sharpshooter?"  Is that kind of like a sniper? 




 Looks like the [American people after Obama killed Osama](http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01302/celebration02_1302873a.jpg). 




 Killing people, on the other hand, is just peachy keen. 




 If Burma succeeds, the president told West Point cadets recently, **we will have gained a new partner without having fired a shot**. But two years after Obama made a historic visit to the Southeast Asian nation, the achievement is in jeopardy.

What a strange thing to sayWhat does he mean? 




 Check out the photo of Bales. 




 Or, alternatively, the eight Presidents who personally killed the most innocent people. 




 What a horrible person Rand Paul is.  How could you grow up in Ron Paul's house and be this misguided and evil? 




 "I think it is clear by now: Israel has shown remarkable restraint. It possesses a military with clear superiority over that of its Palestinian neighbors, yet it does not respond to threat after threat, provocation after provocation, with the type of force that would decisively end their conflict. But sometimes restraint can work against you. Sometimes you just have to say, enough is enough." 




 And her own parents narc'd on her:

Conley's parents contacted the FBI, telling them that their daughter's beliefs were far more extreme than they'd previously thought. Their daughter, they told the FBI, had started to hide her Internet activity, too. 




 Wow, what an insightful comment.  Thanks! 




 This modern man, Cheney, however needs no kingship, no ornate palaces, no personally-owned colony like the Congo; Cheney's writ is the world. It is all of humankind that Cheney would torture, enslave, murder, or plunder if it were required. And Cheney is the ultimate arbiter of whether it is required.

 




 The President's decision to send 300 advisers to Iraq is a good first step, but their ability to deter ISIS will be limited unless we eventually engage in airstrikes to target their leaders as well as the supply lines that they use to transfer weapons and fighters between Syria and Iraq.

I wonder who wrote this garbage for him? 




 Rep. J. Randy Forbes (R-VA) is the Chairman of the House Armed Services Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee and co-chair of the Congressional China Caucus. 




 I would stop talking about withdrawing from Afghanistan, Cheney said. We ought to stay in Afghanistan. We shouldnt be scaling back. 




 Rep. Andy Harris, Maryland Republican, sponsored the amendment and argued that marijuana use can negatively affect the brain development of children. 




 A war was created in Afghanistanthere was no war, there is no war, and I would never agree to be at war in my own country. I would never be a commander in chief fighting a war among my own people. No. I am happy I wasnt, and I will not be. 




 Why the hyphenated qualifier of "al Qaeda-American?"  Does this make it easier to justify the killing? 




 What about their "safe operating space" in Germany and the United States? 




 MARCO RUBIO: Well, if you look at what happened before 9/11, the reason why al Qaeda was able to carry out the 9/11 attacks is because they had a safe operating space in Afghanistan that the Taliban had given them. 




 Cheney says hes worried that as troops are withdrawing from Afghanistan the U.S. wont be able to stop terrorists from getting their hands on nuclear weapons in neighboring Pakistan. 




 But he still doesn't rule out military action: "And while **we may not completely rule out airstrikes**, there are many questions that need to be addressed first." 




 More than a decade  and $5 billion  later, here's the GTMO scorecard: eight convictions, one of them overturned by a civilian court; six others face trial; and 779 detainees have been transferred to other countries, including the five Taliban members recently traded for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. 




 Then why did you send them arms? 




 Except, apparently, Barack Obama. 




 Since ISIS seized Mosul, I've been getting asked a lot whether I feel as though our fight in Iraq "wasn't worth it" or whether I think my time there was "wasted."

I don't.

**I am a Marine and I would have gone anywhere my country sent me.** 




 Great comment.  Thanks.  I'm especially impressed with your use of the word "retards."  That alone proves that you're smarter than everyone else. 




 "They always said that Bush and Gitmo and Cheney were the greatest recruitment tools for Al-Qaeda.  Wrong.  It's Obama and his stand-down isolationist, appeasement view.  The perception of United States weakness is the greatest motivating factor they have."

 




 The President has a range of options. U.S. military and intelligence personnel can airdrop riverine craft into the Euphrates, or attempt to co-opt, cripple, and compromise adversary communication networks. 




 Tyler Cowen is a professor of economics at George Mason University. 




 Lindsey Graham, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said a U.S. partnership with longtime foe Iran makes him uncomfortable but likened it to the United States working with Soviet leader Josef Stalin in World War II against Adolf Hitler. He says the United States has to do what it can to keep Baghdad from falling to insurgents. 




 And while the Iraqi leadership deserves "much of the blame," a relatively small presence of American troops in Iraq would have been a wise choice to keep the fighting at bay. 




 How to kill people? 




 Baghdad is going to be overrun. The Green Zone is going down.
- U.S. intelligence official 




 Not a troll, just thought the headline was hilarious. 




 Please watch and then compare to what he's saying now about Afghanistan, Syria, etc. 




 I am not telling you they dont have the ability to go back and get involved [in the Afghan conflict], he said. But they also have an ability to get killed doing that. I dont think anybody should doubt the capacity of the United States of America to protect Americans. 




 **Over the course of its yearlong deployment, the platoon would lose none of its two dozen soldiers.** But their battalion lost men, and many soldiers have blamed the search for Sergeant Bergdahl for some of those deaths. 




 The reason is that **we put a value on individual human life the way that the barbarians on the other end of the table dont**, he said. And thats why we always end up with unequal swaps. 




 Defeated on the battlefield in two back-to-back wars, we can vent our frustrations on this sad, lonely and nearly-starved young man. 




 He's a fucking traitor

And you are a murder-advocating fool.  Go away. 




 Frankly, we dont give a shit why he left, one White House official said at the time. Hes an American soldier. We want to bring him home.

 My guess is that McCain has no idea who these detainees even are.  Sounds like talking points from his neo-con overseers. 




 A former American Special Operations officer said there was a broader lesson for any future Libya training mission: **The take-away here is theyre going to take a lot more adult supervision** to make sure the checks and balances are in place, so you dont have outside militia taking over. 




 Slater was reminded of his own vulnerability after an army fuel truck came rumbling down a highway ramp, crossed the median and rolled over a civilian hatchback. Dispatched to the scene to do the recovery work, the Marines found themselves completely exposed. The night was clear, the lights of Fallujah shone brightly in the distance, the moon was full and insurgents could easily pick them off with sniper fire or a bomb detonated on the road underneath. Meanwhile, the hatchback had been crushed to a height of inches, and **the Marines were tasked with extracting what was left of the Iraqi mother and child inside.** 




 Yeah, that was painful to watch.  I think he thought people would applaud when he said America would be in Afghanistan past 2014. 




 Watch the video.  He is so pathetic without his teleprompter. 




 You didn't answer my question. 




 So if I were smart, I would think like you? 




 You are a man of many reddit IDs. 




 Holder acknowledged the deaths of four U.S. citizens in drone strikes in Yemen, including Awlakis 16-year-old son, but said that only Awlaki had been a target. **The others were killed incidentally in strikes against other targets.** 




 "I took a helicopter ride from occupied territories across ... and just felt, personally, how extraordinary that was to understand the military risk that Israel faces every day," Christie said. 




 I have a son getting ready to enter the Navy this month and people often ask me: "Are you OK with him entering such a dangerous profession?" For me the answer is easy: I am honored and humbled by his eagerness to defend his country and stand up for the democratic principles of the Constitution. 




 I wonder if he mourns the million people he killed in Iraq... 




 I wouldnt be waiting for some kind of permission from some guy named Goodluck Jonathan, he added, referring to the president of Nigeria. 




 Great comment.  Thanks 




 **Al Qaeda still seeks weapons of mass destruction. If acquired, they will immediately deploy them to try and mass murder American civilians.** This underscores the overriding importance of supporting a continuing U.S. military presence in Afghanistan past 2014  one that will guarantee our ability to crush Al Qaeda central. 




 There is no such thing as a "good" politician. 




 Written by Ron Paul hater James Kirchchick. 




 Yemen has become among the least permissive environments for U.S. officials in recent years. American military and intelligence personnel have played a crucial role in counter terrorism efforts in Yemen, regularly striking suspected militants with drones, and providing support to the countrys fledgling security forces. 




 What if the girls were Swedish?  Would she make the same statement and send Special Ops and the FBI into Sweden to rescue them? 




 "Dancing" at "Club Naked?"  Is that the latest euphemism for visiting a prostitute? 




 Rick Santorum is the perfect face for the GOP. 




 What a strange headline:

1.  U.S. "officers" rather than "Special Ops Commando" and "CIA agent."

2.  "Armed Civilians." Why not use the usual "terrorists," "insurgents" or "rebels?"

It just seems to me that that headline was written by someone who is interested in developing a certain storyline. Or, maybe it's just a really bad headline... 




 If you're Rand Paul's campaign manager, you may want to ditch the hipster sunglasses. 




 Please watch the video. 




 Can you imagine Ron Paul doing this? 




 In her statement, Rice defended her record, saying that she was honored to serve her country and that she had "defended America's belief in free speech and the exchange of ideas." But she said she didnt want to detract from the spirit of the commencement ceremony.

 U.S. taxpayers have spent $7.5 billion over the past 12 years on counternarcotics efforts inside Afghanistan, but the withdrawal of troops has prompted a massive surge in the drug trade, Americas top watchdog inside the country warned in a report Wednesday. 




 A glass door was smashed at VIP Cannabis, 2949 W. Alameda Ave. in Denver. Video from a television news helicopter showed agents dressed in marked DEA clothing had worked to open two safes at the shop. The store, which is operated by Gerardo and Luis Uribe, has a "closed for remodeling" sign in the front window. 




 He died in "Baraki Barak" district.  How appropriate. 




 Just out of curiosity, who are "you guys?" 




 Spoken like a true winner of the Nobel Peace Prize. 




 Palin went on to criticize politicians that have spoken out in favor of cutting military benefits and **those who break bread with those who think it makes no difference how our military heroes died in Benghazi or anywhere else trying to protect America**, a possible swipe at Hillary Clinton, who made a similar statement about the Benghazi attacks as secretary of State.

The guys who died in Benghazi were "trying to protect America?"  Huh? 




 Remember, [this is the guy](http://img.rt.com/files/news/1f/51/e0/00/bradley-manning.si.jpg) your government told you to be afraid of.

 Sorry, I just wanted to highlight the quote to show that Israeli influence over U.S. foreign policy was recognized even shortly after the creation of Israel.  And to point out that Dulles was probably an anti-Semite and not worthy of having an airport named after him.
