 I have an alter-ego named "Kyle." Kyle is a smarmy, sarcastic, charming, manipulative, asshole, but the kind that everyone wants to have sex with.


I am a girl, and my name is definitely not "Kyle." 




 I do this sober. I never thought to do it drunk, but I bet a boiled egg makes a great drunk snack. 




 I live my life by the fuck you, I do what I want. I'm a 30 year old woman, sitting in my bed, which is covered with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles sheets, in my room, which is covered floor to ceiling in posters for everything I love which includes -

80's slasher movies, 
Kpop boy bands, 
Professional wrestling, 
video games, 
super heroes and giant robots-

I AM A GODDAMN ADULT I PAY MY BILLS AND SHIT I CAN LIKE WHAT I WANT 




 Raw is waaaay more fun to go to, and worth the money IMO. It's a very fun experience. 




 I'm a 30 year old woman and I do this as well. My girlfriend, My best friend and I will sit in my room, drink, and watch the WWE network until 3am with no regrets.
