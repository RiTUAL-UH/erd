 yaaaaassssssssss 




 not if charles died and he's just impersonating him. 









 Lucas is A. He was seen with a black hoodie, he has motive, he may have been adopted, he loves toy planes and cars. Yeah I think he's Charles 




 thank you so much for the pictures. I now think and I think it seems to fit more, that Charles is Lucas. But thank you very much for the pics. 




 thanks for posting original link.  




 I dunno it happened in an episode.
