 This is why there *never* will be "normal" relations between the US and Cuba -- certainly not anything like US-UK, or US-French, or US-Mali relations.

Cuba is simply independent and does not follow Washington's orders. For that reason the thaw in US relations with Cuba is not a real normalization, it's simply a tactic used by the US to achieve the US' ultimate goal -- the reversal of the Cuban revolution and the return of Cuba to its former status as a US vassal state. 




   Mods should delete this shit. 

I disagree! Deleting this filth is simple censorship. Reddit has these wonderful tools -- upvote and downvote buttons -- to reflect how people feel about posts like this.

Instead of deletion, simply downvote the post into oblivion and, if you're of a mind, add a comment on why this post is utter garbage.

 Because our corporate mass media propaganda system preaches that incessantly as a statement of fact. It's just that simple.

It's the same thing with the claim that Iran is hell-bent on building a nuclear weapon. It doesn't matter that all dozen-plus of the US' intelligence agencies say Iran has no nuclear weapons program, the media (and government) makes the claim and endlessly repeats the false claim and millions either outright believe it or think there must be something to it.

We saw the same type of lies in other US wars -- everything from Vietnam to Iraq. Why did people believe that Iraq had WMD? Why do millions *still* believe that Iraq had WMD?

 "If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it." -- Nazi Germany's propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels. 




 And we de facto control the Saudis -- Iran is independent and does not follow Washington's orders. *That* is the key. 




 The last time I was in the UK it was still possible to find pubs that served lukewarm beer. And since we're talking about barbarism, I thought that pretty much was the definition of that word. Glad to see you guys decided to join the rest of the modern world. :) 




 Stupid woman! There's no such law. Only banks can create new money -- she's not rich enough to do that! 




  Fine, but I will also assume you are British. How does that feel?

Bad. I don't like tea or warm beer.

 So? why does it matter if it's in retaliation.

Burning buildings down is generally considered a pretty slimy, underhanded or barbaric way to fight a war -- it's not like the "honorable" task of shooting and blowing up other soldiers.

Thus, there is a difference between retaliating to barbarism with barbarism, as opposed to initiating such barbarism. 




 Seriously, you underestimate mindless American nationalism.

In the US today you will find *many* people who will argue with a straight face that the US did *not* lose the Vietnam War. Their "logic"? Because the US never lost any major battles and because Thailand, Malaysia and all of southeast Asia did not turn communist -- we really won. Complete victory was simply due to US politicians forcing the military to "fight with one hand behind its back" and the mass media/journalists undermining morale on the US home front.

Aside from mindless nationalism we excel at historical revisionism too! 




 I'm assuming you're British. The British burning down the US White House was *in* *retaliation* for US forces burning down York, Canada (York is now Toronto). 




 Our attempt to conquer (liberate?) Canada was the true start of the American empire.

Our imperial ambitions did not succeed in that war against Britain/Canada, but only a few decades later Mexico would pay dearly when we attacked and stole 1/2 of Mexico (basically, we took all of Mexico that didn't have lots and lots of Spanish-speaking, Catholic Mexicans living in it). 




  Don't know about this "elite" group you reference. Seemed to me like it was mostly the poor and misguided making up the ranks, when I was enlisted. 

Quite true. This is an elite where anyone can join as long as you're willing to accept the indoctrination and play your assigned role in your particular branch of service[sic].

 Your quote at the end suggests to me that you hold some strong opinions about the US military.

Eight years in the military and quite a bit of international experience, along with even more years of academic research, study and observation of US history and geo-politics will -- or should! -- do that to you.

 "Militaristic Propoganda" seems a bit strong, no?

No, I don't think so. In an age where we *routinely* attack other countries and our military commits the most heinous war crimes with impunity, it takes many forms of nationalism and propaganda to whitewash the morals from people's minds to allow them to passively accept nullifying our civil liberties and the military's role. This article is just one piece of one form of that propaganda. More subtle than a military flyover at a football game, but it's much cheaper and likely more effective for the people who read it. 




 None, of course. But US policies against Iraq were/are not deliberately genocidal in intention. We just don't give a damn about the loss of life as long as the US is getting its way. 




 Exactly. Bernie has the support of the people, but unfortunately the US is a plutocratic oligarchy and money buys our elections.

The big corporate money won't really start rolling in until about halfway through the primaries. And we know that cash isn't going to be going to an actual left-leaning politician with the integrity that Sanders has. That money will instead go to a pro-corporate neo-liberal who will then buy the Democratic nomination. 




  And they do expect premiums to rise faster this year, largely because health-care costs are going up faster, too.

With an immoral system based on greedy, for-profit corporations where your indentured servant "customers" are forced to pay money under penalty of law, of course costs are going to skyrocket! What sort of idiot would think otherwise?

Obama could have installed a cheaper and more efficient single-payer health care system. But Obama unilaterally ruled such a system "off the table." Instead, our corporate stooge president sold the American people out as indentured servants to the private health insurance industry. And now we will pay the price of this sellout.

I won't comment on the irony of the country's first African-American president violating the 13th Amendment which prohibits slavery and indentured servitude. :( 




  No, what worries them much more deeply is that Iran might rejoin the community of nations, possibly even as a diplomatic (and eventually trading) partner of the United States and Europe.

I would disagree. What worries those opposed to the deal is that it *lessens* the ability of the US to enact regime change on Iran.

The US' goal is hegemony over the entire Middle East -- to have the entire region composed of US vassal states that will follow Washington's orders.

Iran is *independent.* An Iran integrated into the global community without sanctions is an Iran that will continue to be independent of Washington's orders. *That* is what imperialists in Washington oppose, that is why they created the fiction about nuclear weapons, and that is why they support regime change in Iran.

 "I hate all forms of imperialism, and I consider the US brand to be the most loathsome and contemptible." -- Nelson Mandela. 




  It appears that the source of the lies was the Administration prior to President Bush.

As the article points out, Clinton knew fully well that Iraq had no WMD. Madeline Albright's famous line that the deaths of 1/2 million Iraqi children was acceptable to keep UN sanctions on Iraq was a complete lie -- those children died as a result of US lies and geo-political imperial games.

Bush was just the tyrant that added more lies to the existing lies and then pulled the trigger on the 2003 Iraqi invasion and subsequent occupation.

The bottom line is that the 20+ years of war on Iraq and all of the US lies and aggression against Iraq were *bi-partisan* moves. The only difference between our 2 ruling parties were petty arguments over tactics. Blood drips from *both* parties' hands.

 "The greatest crime since World War II has been U.S. foreign policy." -- Ramsey Clark, former U.S. Attorney General. 




 Well, the Greek people *have* been betrayed. A week after they voted against austerity their treacherous government caved into the capitalists and banksters and sold the Greek people out.

Greeks *should* *be* pissed. They have every right to be. 









  Israels involvement in Suleimans assassination raises questions about both the purpose of the killing, as well as whether Israel violated international law in conducting the operation.

Give me a frigging break. We have to wonder whether going onto another country's soil and launching a military operation to assassinate one of their high-ranking uniformed military officers is a violation of international law?

Let's be serious.

This is politically correct madness -- it's an act of war by Israel, plain and simple. It's just that Israel is protected by the US and Syria is under attack so the Syrians cannot respond to the Israeli bully. 




  So then here we have just a clear systemic institutionalized effort laid bare, but of course that's not enough either is it, still not enough, 

Exactly. It's the same concept that keeps our government's skulduggery overseas going. When the US-backed/trained/funded/armed Egyptian military overthrows an elected government and enacts a reign of terror murdering hundreds of civilian supporters of the government, the US claims we had nothing to do with it -- and people swallow it.

When we fund the violent overthrow of an elected government in Ukraine for the second time in ten years, even though we have a tape recording of US diplomats arranging the coup and picking out the new prime minister, the US denies any involvement and then point fingers at Russia and claims they're the aggressor -- and people swallow it.

Countless police murders of mostly blacks but yet the government says it's not racist and that we don't have a massive, systemic problem of police brutality, oppression and murder -- and people swallow it.

It seems the American people have an infinite ability to ignore the truth and to believe BS.

 "The great moral American people would rather believe government lies than to acknowledge the government's crimes and to hold the government accountable." -- Assistant Secretary of the Treasury in the Reagan administration and Associate Editor of the Wall Street Journal Paul Craig Roberts. 




 No, different capitalists/oligarchs.

Just the same mindsets, greed and values. 









 Sorry, the next time I see Jimmy Carter I'll correct him. :)

**Edit:** Seriously, wasn't "marijuana" the name invented when our corrupt government was beating the drum back in the "[Reefer Madness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgZ_s_cu02s)" days of the 1930s to make marijuana illegal?

As I recall, by giving the weed a Spanish name the anti-drug propagandists orchestrating the prohibition PR campaign were deliberately trying to smear the drug by associating it with Mexicans. 




   it's existence of a system within which nothing can practically be done, while thoughts of going outside of said system have been systematically suppressed.

That's perfectly true. No disagreement there.

 You're acting as if bourgeoisie democracy actually behaves democratically,

No, what I'm saying is that we're doing a *terrible* job organizing and educating people. There are avenues for opposition and organization and we're not taking sufficient advantage of that. Sure, people are indoctrinated to feel powerless, to laugh at serious problems by watching the Daily Show and other entertainment, etc., etc.

But as true as all that is, that doesn't address our issues and without addressing those issues we're doomed to spiral towards barbarism. 




  But a possible dark truth could be that without civil forfeiture (cash, cars, etc to sell), departments may be underfunded. 

That's like saying a school or a bridge repair project may be underfunded.

I mean, if something is underfunded then the decision is easy -- either increase taxes to fund the item, or decide to do without it. It's simple.

A third choice of stealing from people without due process of law -- asset forfeiture -- is not a valid choice in any country that claims to adhere by the rule of law.

**Edit:** Downvotes for Oznog99 (the post above) are uncalled for. He merely pointed out the reality. Just like our corrupt government runs budget deficits year after year because it refuses to raise taxes, some police agencies may operate only because they steal property via asset forfeiture to fund themselves. I read Oznog99's writing not as an advocacy of this type of theft, but as a blunt statement of reality. We should stop avoiding reality and admit the truth. 




 Isn't that like trying to claim that NYC is the safest part of the US because there's 30K police in the city?

But to answer your question, I'd guess some remote village in eastern Siberia where everyone in the village knows everyone else. 




 That's because our government is *so* *broken* and so corrupt, and the 2 political parties that rule the country are so non-representative and dysfunctional, that appealing to their greedy side is the only way marijuana users can get them to legalize the weed that never should have been made illegal in the first place.

 "Penalties against possession of a drug should not be more damaging to an individual than the use of the drug itself; and where they are, they should be changed. Nowhere is this more clear than in the laws against possession of marihuana in private for personal use." -- U.S. President Jimmy Carter, 1977. 




 "Disobedience, in the eyes of anyone who has read history, is humanity's original virtue. It is through disobedience that progress has been made, through disobedience and through rebellion." -- Oscar Wilde, Soul of Man Under Socialism. 









 So a report by one of the US government's propaganda organ gets a couple of friendly "experts" to come out with a sweeping conclusion about our benevolence and kind-hearted wars.

Color me not impressed.

 "Propaganda is to a democracy what violence is to a dictatorship." -- Noam Chomsky. 




  Any degree of impairment is an unnecessary risk.

That's perfectly true. His point that he *felt* "completely safe" is absurd -- isn't that one of the things that "under the influence" does to you?!

The point that should have been made is that a stoned driver is not the same as a drunk driver. Neither is as safe as a sober driver, but there is a *big* difference between the two. 









 A thought-provoking, well-explained piece which highlights that the real left and the far-right do indeed see some problems in an identical light, and -- maybe -- can work together to deal with the problem.

And if this is true on a racially-charged issue like incarceration, why not on issues like civil liberties and/or domestic spying? 




 Since there was no way you could have watched the piece in the time before you posted, unless you watched this earlier in the day, I have to wonder how you could come to such a quick conclusion.

What were your thoughts about the Koch representative/spokesman's points and personal stories featured in the report?

Are you saying that Van Jones is a gullible fool and that he came to the wrong conclusion when he talked about his wrestling with the fact that it was a Koch brothers campaign that forced him to resign from the White House but that he saw this as a bigger, more important issue than his own personal grievance?

Please, give me *something* to convince me that you're not just doing some Yellow Dog Democratic knee-jerk thing without even viewing the video.
