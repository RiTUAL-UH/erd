 You've complained about this for so long, please stfu and git gud.  The rest of the players either just play him or moved on, quit whining like a little school girl.  Micro is harder now, you just have to pay attention and stop being lazy. 




 Other than the Trolly comments (2015 people, grow up stop being ignorant), I do agree Sativa is better for playing DotA.  Don't touch indica if you wanna keep mmr, but everyone reacts differently. 




 I expect Reddit to be there. 




 I've gone public. 




 asshole 




 Laker fan since 93, only new Laker fans think mitch knows what the fuck he's doing.  You have to really know the lakers organization way back to understand how much of a doofus he is, if you're some bandwagon fan, you probably don't know shit. 




 According to the morons on this subreddit, I'm supposed to think he has a brain and knows how to steer this ship.  Probably weren't laker fans for long if they think Mitch is passable as a GM.  




 Well played, guy.  That was a good laugh.
