 [but why is it in italy ?](http://crossfit928.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/get-in-my-belly-2-560x346.jpg) 




 my cup runeth over ! 




 spotlight was bound to be harsh on whatever successor ! 








































































































 and if you want not to be able to drink it ! 


































 this seems like a much easier alternative though still an extra step potentially 




 again delayed maybe but not prevented 



















 sure due to rules and regs it is probably not feasible at quite the same speeds but there is definitely room for developed nations to streamline construction using prefab techniques and better coordinate parts, labor and assembly 




 could slow it down maybe but not sure anything can really stop it or some other solution . it would be like saying insurance companies will prevent driverless cars . i just dont see it happening .

 Skidmore, Owings   Merrill (S.O.M.) designed the Beinecke Library for Yale University in New Haven, MA. 





























 huh me too now that you mention it 












































 if no one hears it no worries 




 a huge ... ass tree ?

 its true the integration possibilities are definitely dreamy . open thought question : would steve jobs have gone this route ? i feel like he was too perfectionist or minimalist to want to get into vehicles 




 i dont doubt they will try but i do wonder about how much traction they will get . apple just does not seem to me like the company best poised to take this on but i guess only time will tell . 



















 oh nevermind i just noticed now something was submitted on the same technology earlier today and will delete this one now . though really the bbc article does not focus on the future any more than this one from what i can tell . either way it is very neat and has cool future implications so i am glad it is getting attention ! 









 maybe but without jobs can they really afford to spread themselves out so far beyond their core money makers i wonder ? 




 i am a bit confused . this is a budding new technology that could change the landscape of 3d printing but is still in research and development . how is this not about the future ? 

















































 why yes i am ! 














 i would argue that is a good definition of creative at least in terms of thinking outside of the box 




 and it was very creative !
