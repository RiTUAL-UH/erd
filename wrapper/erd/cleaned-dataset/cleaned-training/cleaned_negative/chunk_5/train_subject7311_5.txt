 How do you deal with different reactions (positive/negative) to your cosplays and other professional photo shoots that you do? (meaning underwear ect). I'm guessing most people/fans will be happy with your work but is it difficult at times when there are people simply "hating" or "trolling" on your page in an effort to put down the great work you do?
