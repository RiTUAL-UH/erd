 He was diagnosed 1 month ago and given anti-depressants after feeling low for a few months (which has been happening now and then for four years but he has never been to the doctors).
When he was diagnosed he told me he needed space to sort his head out and for me to not talk to him for a few weeks, no-contact.

I obliged and after 1 week he said he didn't like the thought of me being upset and it was all he could focus on so we decided to start texting again and he came and saw me, but he said he didn't know if he wanted to see me again for a while. 

I then saw him that weekend for about two hours, and have seen him once a week since then usually for a night and a few hours the next day. He actually seems completely normal and happy when I have seen him which is nice.

I am not seeing him throughout the week, and he has not come round to see my family I have gone to see his.
He has forgotten our anniversary and I gave him a card but he didn't get me one or offer to pay for the dinner (something he would usually offer on our anniversary)

I feel constantly on edge and nervous he's going to stop speaking to me or going to decide he can't see me. I think I'm having a hard time thinking that the depression has caused the way he has been acting because when I see him he is normal and excited about his job and just not different.

We haven't had sex for about 7 weeks because of the depression and now the anti-depressants have taken away his sex-drive. When we do see eachother we cuddle and it's nice but it's not the same intimacy.

I am really struggling with knowing what to do, I miss him and feel so lonely even though he is in my life and I have have such high anxiety levels at the minute. 

This all may sound selfish but it's just hit me how down I have been for the last month doing everything on his terms and praying he feels better and wants me in his life.
