Won't: They're the Astros 




 Ball! Ball! Ball! 




 Damn, guess I'm not ready to quit my day job to pursue writing click-bait for Buzzfeed. 




 Why? What in the world makes someone think this is a good idea?   














 Could you keep it that cute if you fed it coffee and cigarettes?

 I'll lend a hand by checking out golf courses. 




 Congratulations, you may be a politician. 




 Totally worth it 




 I'd expect to get 'a cripple' from more than one politician.

 Andre Ware  
Reggie Rogers.  
Mike Williams 




 I think you replied to the wrong post. Though, I'd love to know how you did it. 




 Dayum! 




 Just breaks my heart 




 I would think beating kids would take care of of all three. 




 But the guy on the bottom looks like his wildest fantasy has finally happened.  




 There are no bad Mexicans just bad owners 




  The one at the bottom who seems to be enjoying being there a little too much?  

*This* guy is the most disturbing.  




 Not if you're standing in the hand rails because there's two feet of shit water on the floor 




 I know this is art, but it really should be tagged NSFW because of the breast. 




 Right? Why would you even be with a woman who doesn't understand that hamburgers comes first.

 I like Betts because of his sub-20 K% with the double digit BB%. Add to that some speed and some pop and he's  almost man-crush worthy. 




 Screw you stick!

 Oakland takes him at 4 in honor of Al Davis 




 Booo! Too soon man, too soon.

 My childhood was a lie!

 But the synopsis makes it sound awesome.  
The equation has never been more accurate than in the brilliant Czech surrealist's newest film, "Little Otik," based upon a classic fairy tale of an infertile couple who adopt a tree stump as their baby.

Locked in the basement, Otik becomes a favorite of Alzbetka, a creepily precocious little girl, who is otherwise engaged in reading books on sexual dysfunction and warding off an octogenarian pedophile. 




 I drink out of that!

 If it's half as good as it sounds... 




 February 23... 









 Well i guess poop is better that what I thought it was.  
   
No, no it isn't. 




 I don't know, 6.5" around seems impressive to me regardless of the length.  




 Cauterizing is faster than a tourniquet and more fun. Bonus: leaves a bacon smell in the air.
