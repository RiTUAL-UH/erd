 I first remember hearing it in the first Transformers movie. I think it was when some scorpion robot came out of the dessert and sent out an EMP or something. 

Any idea where it was used first? 




 I didn't know it applied to male birds in general; I thought it was specific to roosters. 




 Watch all [four of these horrible minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zQ8KpzLPL8) and then ask yourself how much of a masochist you are. 

The only good thing about the Ghost Rider movies was how [incredibly cool/badass Ghost Rider looked.](http://i.imgur.com/i7pzzMc.jpg) 




 [I respectfully disagree](http://i.imgur.com/J7cUEhc.jpg).

Look at that.

*Look* at that.

Some characters they got right the first time. It's a motorcycle badass decked out in chains, leather, metal spikes, and a flaming skull for a head.

You just can't top that. 




 I'm also finding Reddit's attitudes on such things hilarious.

The Pirate Bay is great, KimDotCom is great, copyright law is bullshit, I'll download/torrent/whatever I want, everything should be free.

What? Someone stole my YouTube content and didn't give me credit? This is bullshit!

 Possibly. I just didn't want to force anything into the original theory that I couldn't explain using evidence from the books or movies. 




  audiences want some levity in their superheroes

The ones who religiously watch Marvel movies do. Nolan's trilogy was hugely popular and did ridiculous box office numbers, and although opinions vary, Man of Steel did very well for itself too.

It's okay if Marvel and DC have different approaches; they both have their audience.

I would also expect that some of their movies, like The Flash, will be a little lighter in tone. 




 Oh, wow. You saw all 25 of these movies that haven't been made yet and determined not one of them is good? Amazing. 




 You might be right about Suicide Squad; it has been bringing out a lot of mixed opinions. From what I've seen online, a lot of people have already made up their minds to hate it. 

That's neither here nor there, though. WB isn't counting on Suicide Squad to break box office records; that's what Batman/Superman is for, and *that's* the movie that opens the flood gates for Justice League, Cyborg, The Flash, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, etc.

Suicide Squad can flop all day. It won't be the first or last WB movie to do so. 




 It could be causally mentioned or never brought up at all.

Any thinking audience member will assume they're either step-related or one is adopted.  




  what if Christmas in Whoville is in celebration of Horton saving them? Horton could be their equivalent of a christ figure in our world.

I was actually thinking of going there because there's not even a slight reference to Jesus or anything Christian in the Grinch book or the movies, but the timing wouldn't make sense.

Horton Hears a Who! takes place from May 15th-16th and Christmas in Whoville is definitely in the winter. Assuming their holiday would be on the anniversary of their contact with the outside world, it should be May 16th, late spring. 




 You're confused by adoption and think black people are "edgy."

I don't even know where to begin... 




  50+ years of history

They aren't making a movie with 50 years of history, nor are they relying on the average movie-goer to know 50 years of history. They're making a movie based on a thing. That is all. 




 Guardians of the Galaxy 2: Logically the Same Soundtrack 




 I get the joke, but DC Comics officially changed the character's name to SHAZAM! from Captain Marvel to avoid confusion.

It is kind of wonderful those are coming out back-to-back. I love coincidences like this. 




 In The Grinch Who Stole Christmas, the eponymous character is motivated to end Christmas because he cannot bear the noise made by the Whos in Whoville. Their traditions involve making an incredible amount of noise.

In Horton Hear a Who, we learn that the Whos are tiny people-like creatures living on a dust speck which Horton takes upon himself to protect. When he almost fails and the Whos are threatened with having their whole world boiled in Beezlenut oil, Horton encourages them all to make noise so that they sour kangaroo can hear them and confirm their existence.

Whos associate collective loud noise making with their triumph and survival in their darkest hour.

**EDIT**: This theory is based on the two books referenced and not the four movies (two each) based on the books. 




 You're absolutely right; I've known racists of every race and for a variety of reasons/motivations. 

It's not like white people have some copyright on hate. 




 [It's okay to not like things; just don't be a dick about it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0la5DBtOVNI)

And you weren't being a dick about it. 




 Everyone has genres they don't like; no need for excuses. Personally, I can't get into fantasy. If it has elves, goblins, dragons, wizards, etc., you've lost my interest. 




 No one is shitting on your opinions, nor is anyone offended by your taste in books. I'm merely pointing out that run-on sentences by Bradbury are hardly unique in literature and that there are worse offenders. I'd caution you against writing off literature on any such basis. You'd be losing a lot.  




 I'm reasonably sure you've answered the question. Unless anyone intelligently disputes this in the next 12 hours or so, I'll make it as "explained" and move along. Thank you. 




  If you prefer restriction, you are conservative. If you prefer freedom, you are liberal.

So you're saying liberals don't want "restriction" and conservatives don't want "freedom?"

That doesn't sound right. And what do you mean by "restriction?"

___wing refers to your preferred level of government involvement. Right is a lot, left is none.

I'm pretty sure it's the opposite. Right-wingers are the ones always advocating for less government while lefties seem to generally believe in more government programs, or at least better-funded ones. 




 Appreciate it, but you're not actually explaining the difference; you're just saying that there is one. 




 Can you provide examples? I've literally heard Bernie Sanders alone referred to as a Democrat, liberal, left-winger, *and* socialist. Does he just happen to be all four, or could someone be one and not the others or even three but not the fourth? 




 Yeah, I love Billy Tucci in general and this artwork in general, but I'm not getting anything "steampunk" here. 









 It's a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.

Chances are, they don't conveniently have humans speaking American dialect English.

What we're seeing is a movie based on something that happened a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. An English translation featuring a human cast with puppets and CGI.

 It's not a pun; it's a joke by reversing the meaning of the phrase. 




 Kind of. More like his concerns over nuclear armament led to him thinking the world might not even be around by 2000, so enjoy living while we're here. It didn't suppose that the world would end *in* 2000.

If Reddit isn't for pedantry, what is it for? 




 I think most people would either say "No one *has* eaten yet" or "no one *has been* eaten yet," not "no one *is* eaten." 




 Not every iteration of Batman was going for the level of realism that the Nolan trilogy was, nor did every iteration of Batman have zero knee cartilage and a broken back. In fact, the only other iteration of Batman who had his back broken is the DC Comics version. He's still active because he's also died and come back. Comics don't even try to make sense. 




 Coincidentally the [same top comment.](http://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/30ldrv/bleeding_through/)

You're not alone.

 K. 




 This is the time you're taking due to my pointing out that your comment was similar to someone else's title of this post and I'm the one in need of a life.

K. 




  1) Do you know what the word verbatim means? I get that you said "almost verbatim" but that'd be like if a word or two was different...not nearly every single word. 

Your comment: "Hahha, the poor dummy is holding the bow wr-oh. Well. Shit."

Post title: "Thats not how you hold your b...oh!"

****ALMOST*** verbatim, as in ***NOT*** verbatim, but similar. It's called "hyperbole." You'll find it's fairly common on the internet. You're not being attacked, so lower the defenses. You're not a bad guy, a stupid guy, or whatever else you managed to infer offense from.

2) People have similar thoughts....inconceivable!

Yeah... which is exactly what I pointed out. Brilliant.

3) Also...man, this post is five days old. Your backlog of reddit comment detective work must be growing by the day. 

I can't even figure out what you're trying to say. Yes, this post is five days old. It's the one your comment reminded me of. What "backlog of Reddit comment detective work" of mine is "growing by the day?" What does that even mean?

If this is the worst thing to happen to you today, congratulations on an amazing life.

 Probably, but stages of development are so incredibly varied that they can be terribly difficult to pin down; "milestones" are horribly misleading. It's entirely possible for a child to be remarkably behind his or her peers in kindergarten and then go on to be top of his or her class just a few years later. There are so many factors and variables, I don't put much stalk in milestones.

 [Ah...](https://youtu.be/GVHPEJoMGsY?t=20s) 




 I'm not understanding your logic.

If climate change is real, largely man-made, and reversible, the opposition funding climate change denial is profit motivated because whatever they're selling--fossil fuels, etc.--is the leading cause of the problem.

The other side--solar panel producers, the makers of windmills, etc.--have a profit motive, which is to sell things that reduce carbon emissions and thereby reduce pollution.

I get *their* motivations, but what sensible person prefers we continue to burn fossil fuels, produce carbon emissions, and continue to pollute at reckless levels? What's the downside to reducing pollution? 




 I agree. I wasn't saying it shouldn't be included; I just feel it's necessary to point out that it's a satire of dystopian novels, not a true dystopian novel in and of itself, i.e., it's not meant to be taken seriously as 1984, Fahrenheit, etc. are. 




 I don't know about most parents, but I personally find Pinky Pie to be the most annoying character on the show.

 I just ctrl+f'ed to make sure someone did. 




 Truth be told, this is the first gif I've ever made, so it's safe to say I have no idea what I'm doing. I googled it and makeagif.com came up. 




 Makeagif.com gives you five seconds. It was either cut out the bump or cut out the basketball off the dome. I made my choice and I stand by it. 




 There are elements of all three throughout the world to be sure. Huxley got it right in that indoctrination and making the slaves happy to be slaves is the superior way to achieve domination. 

Orwell got it right in that surveillance, control of media, information, history, and ideas through propaganda works.

Bradbury was the one who determined that we'd embrace the oppressor. We'd gleefully surrender our rights and that entertainment would be such a welcome distraction that we'd completely miss the important stuff. 




 I like all those books, but it should be noted that Harrison Bergeron is a satirical sendup of the dystopian novel rather than one purely in and of itself. 




 If you find stock pictures of people and add the text over the pictures in sequence so it reads like a comic strip I can almost guarantee a huge hit. 




 You'd hate Faulkner.

Or Proust.

Or Dickens.

Christ, I could go on all day. These are great authors, not sixth graders turning in an essay on their summer vacations. 




 Besides maybe Animal Farm, The Scarlet Letter, and Huckleberry Finn, I can scarcely imagine an easier book on which to write an essay. 




 To each their own, but I prefer a book with sparse details. I have an imagination; let me use it. I don't need the description of the wallpaper, curtains, or what clutter occupies the coffee table unless any of it is at all relevant to the plot. 




 That's a far better thing than ending not soon enough and leaving you wanting less. 




 You're certainly entitled to your feelings/reactions, but I can't even begin to guess at the sheer wealth of art that you are denying yourself if a man smacking his wife prevents you from even finishing a thing. 




 There is no "be all/end all" of dystopian fiction, but, by all means, contribute other, better works. It adds much more to the conversation than a snarky comment and blanket dismissal of the opinions of roughly 4,823,408 people. 




 Out of Bradbury, Orwell, and Huxley, I'd say Bradbury's vision of the future in Fahrenheit 451 hits much closer to the mark than the others.

 I was recently asked to do a Wally West   Bart Allen one, so here that is for anyone curious:

Sure, and The Flash extended family goes even beyond that, but Wally   Bart should be easy enough.

Wally West goes way back to 1959. There was a very powerful trend in DC Comics to give their marque superheroes a child sidekick, and The Flash was no exception, so [Wally West was introduced as "Kid Flash."](http://i.imgur.com/OowRBRA.jpg) 

Barry was dating Iris West at the time and Wally was her nephew. As if the costume isn't unoriginal enough, he got his powers because the exact same accident that gave Barry his powers happened to Wally.

Barry sacrificed himself in the Crisis on Infinite Earths in 1986. Wally gave up the Kid Flash moniker and replaced The Flash, but this was also a way for the editorial staff to nerf the character a bit, as he had become OP as fuck over the years. He could no longer go faster-than-light, but rather the speed of sound and sometimes a bit beyond, much like our CW Barry. 

Wally eventually came across Reverse-Flash (Eobard Thawne) and had to up his game, so OPAF Flash returned because he had to match Eobard's speed. Sometime during the 90s, the concept of "Speed Force" was introduced by Mark Waid, which became the go-to explanation of expanded powers and general fuckery that couldn't otherwise be made sense of. With the variety set of new powers, Speed Force as a way of explaining anything, and the ability to go faster-than-light, it has been argued by some, quite logically, that The Flash is actually more powerful and more OP than Superman.

As of the Flashpoint/New 52 event, Barry Allen is the only Flash to have ever existed in mainstream continuity, but they have shown Wally West in the future. He's now biracial and [sports a new costume.](http://i.imgur.com/WlY1dv4.jpg)

Bart Allen, in pre-Flashpoint 52 continuity, would be the fourth to become The Flash after Jay Garrick, Barry Allen, and Wally West. [He debuted as Impulse in 1994](http://i.imgur.com/DRUfBsS.jpg) and later became Kid Flash. He's a descendant of Barry Allen and Iris West, but is also a Thawne. Just like Wally West was a sidekick "Kid Flash" to Barry Allen, Bart Allen was a sidekick to Wally West.

Bart Allen even got to be the fourth Flash in his own series ever-so-briefly but was [killed off](http://i.imgur.com/M2OT1Io.png) in 2006 only to be brought back as [Kid Flash in 2009](http://i.imgur.com/mtYf3pJ.jpg) thanks to an event called Final Crisis. 

After the continuity reshuffle of Flashpoint and the New 52, he was a time-displaced [Kid Flash](http://i.imgur.com/VwWk678.jpg) with the Teen Titans with some serious amnesia problems.


 

 




 [Jay Garrick was the original Flash.](http://i.imgur.com/M2VD5ug.jpg) He was [cancelled in 1951](http://i.imgur.com/jyzFIvH.jpg) as superhero comics were waning. 

[Barry Allen was a reboot in 1956](http://i.imgur.com/xOzQpVu.jpg), an attempt to revive a classic character. [Jay Garrick existed to Barry Allen as a comic book character.](http://i.imgur.com/9er8eTm.jpg) Eventually, DC thought it would be cool to have the two meet, so to explain this, they were both [The Flash of two different worlds.](http://i.imgur.com/E3JsTF0.jpg) 

Flash forward to 1976, Jay Garrick and other old-timey comic book characters were brought back in the parallel world's answer to the Justice League: [The Justice Society.](http://i.imgur.com/LIYkZWa.jpg)

In 1985, DC Comics had one of the biggest events in comic book history called ***CRISIS*** on Infinite Earths. You'll recall The Flash [disappearing in a ***CRISIS***](http://i.imgur.com/Nii95UB.jpg) in Eobard's newspaper from the future. This event merged all the parallel worlds of DC Comics into one, so Jay Garrick was retconned as having [always existed in the same world as Barry Allen and was in fact his predecessor, the original Flash.](http://i.imgur.com/uQ8Bkbz.jpg)

After an event called Flashpoint where [The Flash goes back in time to save his mother from getting murdered by The Reverse Flash](http://i.imgur.com/kBFQbl8.jpg)  (sound familiar?), DC Comics had itself another reboot establishing the New 52, which, among other things, [merged some of their imprints like Vertigo, WildStorm, Milestone, etc., into mainstream continuity](http://i.imgur.com/2x35VNA.jpg) and just generally messed around with continuity with mixed results. 

Many of DC's "legacy characters" are now featured in "Earth 2," again establishing multiple worlds. [Jay Garrick is The Flash of Earth 2](http://i.imgur.com/4rmSaSu.jpg), just like he was way back in the 60s.

If anyone has anything to add/clarify/correct, please weigh-in. I know I left a lot out, but my goal was an abridged breakdown of the essentials for the uninformed, not a comprehensive guide. 




 The strange thing with all this time travel is the paradoxes it necessarily creates. Eddie killed himself, so Eobard was never born, but he only disappears from existence at the time when Eddie killed himself. If he was never born, he never would have existed at all, meaning he never could have gone back in time to kill Barry's mom, blow up the particle accelerator, etc., and no one would have any memory of him because he'd have never existed.

But what's really fucky for me is that Eobard was from a different timeline than Eddie, so Eddie's sacrifice should have only affected *his* future. As soon as Eobard went back in time and killed Barry's mother, he created a new timeline--one that he was stuck in. I would assume the Eddie of *his* timeline, the one he traveled back in time from, is alive and well.

Remember, they have 100% established that going back in time creates a new timeline. Eobard confirmed that when he commented on Cisco's ability to remember what happened to him in another timeline. 

So... what if Eddie didn't kill Eobard; he just wanted them to believe he had. We know the wormhole came back, but we don't know what triggered it. Perhaps Eobard never needed the time machine; after all, he didn't have one when he traveled back to kill Barry. 




 I sometimes read comments or entire threads dedicated to the fact that Batman not only has Tony Stark style money and resources but has literally been shown to have cybernetic armor suits on par or superior to any Iron Man suit, so why in the hell does he go without? That's usually met with a variety of answers trying to explain something that really doesn't make much sense, but what about magic?

It is an established fact that the DC Universe--possibly all of them--has magic. Unlike the armor, you can't say "it's not his style" because his style has consistently been to master the crap out of everything, know everything, be the best there is at everything. 

Not only would magic be hugely useful in a number of practical ways, but it would also help him with threats like Superman who are vulnerable to magic (we're talking about a guy who keeps Kyptonite in his utility belt). If the JLA encountered a magical threat, they'd have an ace up their sleeve because Bruce studied the dark arts. 

Anybody got an answer for this? 














 My favorite is probably John Steinbeck's "Of Mice   Men."

**EDIT**: You wonderful people have turned this into one of the best collections of single-sitting reading possible, although I'm not sure I can read this entire thread in a single sitting anymore... 



















 There seems to be a sort of conflation of ideas in that they either reflect your personality/skills and come about accordingly, as evidenced by The Cutie Mark Crusaders trying to "earn" theirs. 

They also seem to suggest that they tell you your destiny, as evidenced by that song/episode "What My Cutie Mark is Telling Me" where the Mane Six had theirs swapped.

What I don't get is names. Rainbow Dash, for example, had the words Rainbow and Dash in her name presumably since birth and she grows up to be the one who can pull off a sonic rainboom or whatever? The name "Dash" connotes speed. You could easily write off the rainbow part if the parents didn't name her until she was born and they noticed the color scheme, but unless they were prescient, they couldn't have known her destiny. 

The same is true of Fluttershy. Her name rhymes with her cutie mark--a butterfly--and she's shy. These are details her parents couldn't have possibly known about her when she was born.

I considered that maybe parents don't name their kids until these facts are established, but not only do the Cutie Mark Crusaders have names, but the infant children of the baker parents have names. 

So what's the deal? Are the parents blessed with some sort of precognition when it comes to naming their offspring? How do foals coincidentally end up with names that represent them every bit as well as their eventual cutie marks do? 

















































 My main question concerns Germany and Japan. Did Japan actually treat their POWs the worst? 

[From Wikipedia:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_war_crimes#Crimes)

According to the findings of the Tokyo Tribunal, the death rate among POWs from Asian countries, held by Japan was 27.1%.[40] The death rate of Chinese POWs was much higher becauseunder a directive ratified on August 5, 1937 by Emperor Hirohitothe constraints of international law on treatment of those prisoners was removed.[41] Only 56 Chinese POWs were released after the surrender of Japan.[42] After March 20, 1943, the Japanese Navy was under orders to execute all prisoners taken at sea.[43] Around 1,536 U.S. civilians were killed or otherwise died of abuse and mistreatment in Japanese internment camps in the Far East; by comparison, 883 U.S. civilians died in German internment camps in Europe.[44] 



















 I'm a little confused after reading [Douglas Haigs final dispatch](http://www.firstworldwar.com/source/haiglastdespatch.htm) and [David Lloyd Georges comments on the battle of the Somme.](http://www.gwpda.org/1916/llgsomme.html)

I'm just having trouble marrying [Erich von Falkenhayns justification of the Verdun Offensive](http://www.firstworldwar.com/source/verdun_falkenhayn.htm) and [Erich Ludendorffs assessment of Verdun.](http://www.firstworldwar.com/source/verdun_ludendorff.htm)

Is an accurate, fair, unbiased assessment even possible at this point? Am I in need of a better source?

***EDIT***: Wow! Thanks for the amazing responses, especially the encyclopedic entry by /u/DuxBelisarius! This is why this sub has quickly become one of my favorites! This is incredible! 









 Vertigo still counts, right? 














 Choices include: 

	A turning-point battle or campaign

	The part played by generalship or command ability in a given conflict or battle

	The success or failure of a given state or society as it modernized, or attempted to modernize, its way of war

	The impact of a particular technological innovation on strategic thinking or the combat experience

	The role of war in changing socio-economic/racial/gender norms, or the role of socio-economic/racial/gender changes in shaping the composition or character of a given army

	The increased impact of war on civilian populations

	Questions of military ethics and/or war crimes

Then something specific from there. I'm most interested in either a.(The role of war in changing socio-economic/racial/gender norms, or the role of socio-economic/racial/gender changes in shaping the composition or character of a given army) or b.(Questions of military ethics and/or war crimes) but having difficultly narrowing it down to something specific. Any assistance at all would be greatly appreciated. 




 If the tip is to lace through that little loop thingie on the tongue itself, that is currently the case and this thing still wants to go to the side, which makes the sneaker uncomfortable. Any suggestions? 




 I know hindsight is 20/20 and we have the benefit of looking back, but it seems like a clash of at least two of the great powers stacked with new industrial revolution weaponry, mobility, and lethality was inevitable, much less plausible, and yet, it seems it went largely unexpected by the experts. Why?

 My thesis is that building a successful military depends primarily on three factors: motivations of patriotism/nationalism/jingoism, political motivation/will, and of course, the professional expertise to execute plans.

This is as far as democratic/free societies go; of course a dictatorship will simply build military might as they see fit.
 









 I am in New Hampshire. I have a screen capture of the ad where the claim "needs nothing" is made. I contacted the seller and asked him to take the car back for a full refund and he refused. Do I have any legal recourse? Can I sue for false advertising, or is the "needs nothing" claim to vague?

**EDIT**: So the consensus seems to be that 

1. I'm an idiot.

2. I'm screwed.

3. Get a second opinion on the estimate.

I guess I'll get the second opinion, and I guess I can't sue this guy, but now I gotta figure out what to do with this car if I don't want to pay the three grand to fix it (I don't).

Thanks for your help! 














 For all the bitching and moaning about Barbara, no one has more cringe-y scenes than this woman. 




 We currently live in New England and our daughter will be turning six in July. We've heard a lot of bad things about Texas public schools. We're looking to move to San Antonio. Are the schools really that bad? Do they really teach alternative history and creationism? Anyone have any insight?

 To answer my own question: 

1. Deathstroke VS Deadpool from DC and Deadpool VS Deathstroke from Marvel. 

Slade wins in the DC version while Wade takes the victory in Marvel's. The Marvel book reunites Joe Kelly   Ed McGuinness while DC's reunites Marv Wolfman   George Perez.

 Maybe it's something personal, maybe it was good but too disturbing for multiple viewings, maybe it was to satisfy a curiosity, whatever.

For me, there's Ichi The Killer and Oldboy. Glad I saw them, but once was enough.

**EDIT**: Add Audition to the list, and for whatever reason, I used to watch those Guinea Pig movies in my young 20s. Also, Dog Tooth. 









 I say "last year or two" because I've seen all the classics and even most of the modern classics. If it features a well-known masked killer or is part of a franchise that requires two hands to count sequels, I've definitely seen it. 

The last horror movie I saw that I absolutely loved was The Cabin in the Woods.
