 they use the lights, and each person they have attacked save ryback has had a beef with him previously
 




 what if the sheild is working for the undertaker as well as paul heyman? 




 say i have two wild beastmasters in play and i blood rush one of them do the effects of the blood rush continue to stack with the two beastmasters bouncing off of one another? 




 So heres the deal, i have never really lived in a larger city before and i have no idea what im getting into.  I am very into table top games and movies.  so with that in mind where would i go to meet like minded people and make new friends who are down to sling some cardbored or roll some dice?
