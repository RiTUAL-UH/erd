 I'm amazed at the shit that gets to the top in this sub.  




 Probably should have been sent to Flint.  




 Not Flint, Michigan?  




 There was am awesome one last year at two roads. I couldn't make it but everyone seemed to have a great time via the pics etc.  




 Please show me where Obama is attempting to take away the right for someone to pray. 

Edit: can anyone?  




 My primary said that she was prepared to do a prostate exam but since we had scheduled a visit with a gastroenterologist we could just wait. I'm a dude so yah, I decided to wait. Not sure why I would feel more comfortable with a guy sticking shit up my ass but...i am.

 Twisted.

 Swallows do that here where I live on a small island along the mouth of the ct river in Old Lyme, Connecticut. Really fascinating to watch.  




 lol

 Cops know about it. A bus driver filmed the altercation. I'm in the other side if the country. It's a friend of mine in Eugene. Just wondering by chance if anyone knows the guy and knows the whereabouts of the dog. Shot in the dark.  




 How do toy know it was reported?  




 "what's this thing around me neck?"  




 You think that's strictly a teenager thing? That's cute. 




 Came here for this. Not let down.

 I've got a grill full of cheeseburgers, flap steaks, and shrimp in my back yard right now. Care to join? 




 Once again, thank you. 

This isn't an event actually but kayaking season is well underway. Heading out now in old Lyme. I'd like to have a semi regular /r/connecticut  kayak gathering this summer. Get at me anyone.

 How's it hanging man?  




 I'm so afraid of this. I'm an only child raised by my single mom. She has had two heart surgeries and is now battling cancer, going through chemo. This is so very tough. I'm very sorry for what you have gone through.

sorry, everyone who has allergies. 




 I want to joke along but I just can't.

 depending on who you are I suppose and where you live etc...

it's not black and white per say.

 Yep. Seattle had some amazing places. Would spend every day in those shops. 




 Oh fuck is that like another play on Christianity? Like, wedding alter bridge?  














 She's a certified dietician?

 yah, why don't people understand this is what boggles my mind.  




 meat sauce lasagne though, right? 
























 Did a sunset paddle last night on the lake I just moved to. Loving being able to just drag my kayak out and go. 









 The battery is bulging. Lasts 1/2 a day. Fairly heavy user. Can anyone give me the best amazon link for what I'm looking for? 


































 I've been looking online and can't seem to find anything that has convinced or otherwise. It's a scary time and while this doesn't seem like it would do any harm is it's still weirding me out. 









 I got into them really early when they were just starting to hit the scene. Loved everything and then responsibility and my 30's hit and  for some reason keeping up on albums etc went by the wayside.

I spent a good 5-6 years just throwing on the old stuff I knew or just talk radio when it came to silence.

Listening to El Pintor for my first time all the way through. (I know, i'm late) but damn its almost a better feel knowing its a trio. That video for Everything is Wrong. Holy shit is that not the coolest video. 10/10 on that video.
 





























 Not sure if it matters but I'm in the USA and they are in England. Maybe there is some weird thing that gets in the way. 




 Does this sound interesting? I can cover bass and guitar and any keys. My drums are in storage at the moment and I don't currently own a good mic. 

Lets do this! 




 Any ideas?

 It's like /r/fishing just blowing up.  



















 there's got to be something but I'm not catching it. You? 









 It's strange it happened this way. Of course Sea Change has a lot more "break up" themes but Morning Phase has the same damn feel and all I can do is pump my body full of vodka and soda...and fucking wish I had valium.

Wave might be one of my favorite tracks by him of all time. 

I'm 36, have been into all of his stuff from when I was a kid in the early 90's but this album is the god damn fucking bees fucking knees.  














 No complaints just curious.

Dude is awesome. Anyone follow anything he did the past couple decades? He was in a band called 764-Hero for a time in Seattle. His bass style is awesome.

 Case in point. Let's take this [Savoir Adore song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4ryqWze6U t=33)

and then this [Taylor Swift song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CmadmM5cOk t=17)

Also, as soon as I noticed this I sent a tweet to Savoir Adore and they replied that funny as I wasn't the first one to mention it. 

Fuck, both songs kick fucking ass in my book. 




 Looking to get a few people together.  














 Anyone else live in Seattle for their run?

I did, it was grand. 

[posting my favorite song by them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc0clTOXlBM)

fans of quality shit get at me if you live in Connecticut. Lets make it.  









 *sweeeet* 




 Anyone dealt with this? As always trying to contact them is hilarious. waiting back from an email...

 I plug it in but nothing pops up. Am I doing something wrong?  




 I actually had a front page post of [something related](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qaew2/i_am_a_chef_by_tradetell_me_what_is_in_your/) a couple years ago.

I'm at work with a full kitchen and ready to record. Have at it.

**EDIT** Just getting to edit the first one and going up in a minute. cheers.

**EDIT 2** This is all going to happen but it will take time. Spring project check back.  









 I introduced it to my girlfriend last month and of course she fell in love so we got in a couple episodes a night and then a good 5 or 6 on Sundays. 

Heres the thing...we decided to split up in about the 4th season so we watched one of if not the most deep, relationship heavy shows of all time...while breaking up. We have been together for 6 years. It is fairly amicable but very tough, of course. 

We live together and I am going to be the the one moving out. She has kids (from a previous marriage) which I have grown to love and consider family. This is all very difficult but a new beginning. 

The last 4 episodes starting with Nates death was just a bawling fest but the finale, which I knew was going to be one of if not the most amazing finales was going to crush us. 

Well, it did. We spent the hour or so after the ending just sobbing...talking...apologizing for everything. We are still splitting up but it was very therapeutic to have this all coincide. 

Thank you for reading.

 I do. 15 gigs left. Whats the deal you think? 


































 It's an 03 ranger. They have a lift and full shop... but is there anything I can do to "prep" before I head down there? 


































 Have you ever come across something after they have passed away as well?

EDIT: To clarify. Some alcoholics instead of flaunting it or not give a shit will attempt to hide it. That's what this post is all about. 


































 I live in Connecticut directly across from you and I thought it would be fun sometime to try and get a picture of something silly like a roman candle or something. 

I see your lights often when it's clear. 
























 I've got an 03 Ford Ranger which has been diagnosed by two shops as needing a new transmission. It's drives but I have no reverse or O/D. It shifts into reverse and when I press on the gas it budget a bit. What I am currently doing is turning off the O/D switch on the column and manually shifting 1st into second and then second into D which it then in turn shifts itself from 3rd to 4th. 

A friend of mine has an 02 Explorer which has a blown engine but a working transmission. Both of these vehicles are 4.0 4X4 and Automatic. I'm wondering if I could switch it out? The VIN#'s for both are:

Ranger 1FTZR45E63TA39056

Explorer 1FMDU73K52ZC97255

Also, if not is there any way I could buy one online on the cheap and do it myself (I'm fairly handy). I've got a general knowledge of how these work and a 250 piece craftsman socket set but would rather pay someone if it's impossible for me to do this on my own. 

 














 Keeping mine in comments. 














 Of course something so simple is eluding me.  




 Looking for a mechanic to do some work on the side or anyone who is comfortable doing a tranny switch. I have the vin numbers for both vehicles to make sure they are compatible. 02 ford explorer to a 03 ford ranger. Both automatic both 4.0. both v6. Located in Deep River.  




 Let's hear it.  


































 Why am I having such a terrible time figuring this out? 














 In the late 90's I owned a [Boss BR-8](http://www.bossus.com/gear/productdetails.php?ProductId=437) and I recently came upon a dozen or so of my zip discs.

I have an [iomega zip 100](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Iomega-Zip-100-Drive-USB-100MB-pc-mac-compatible-usb-powered-nice-/201267810149) which is allowing me to download the files. They are in vs3 and vr8 formats. 

Does anyone know where to go from here? Has anyone had any luck? In a perfect world I would love it if there was a Boss app that would just accept these files and let me connect it via fire cable on my ipad.

Yah, right.

I own a windows 7 laptop and an ipad 4gen.

Any ideas?

Thanks for reading. 
























 Sure hoping so.  



















 I think they held on to some big guns in the writing department for this series finale via 4 episodes. There was a time where I was falling "out of love" with the show but these past 2 episodes have really brought me back and now I'm super sad its really going to end.

 I am preparing myself by starting to watch Six Feet Under all the way through (again)
