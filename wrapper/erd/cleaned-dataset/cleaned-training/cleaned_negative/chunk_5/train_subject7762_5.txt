 I have more than one set of bed sheets. How poor are you?  




 No, only I call him Zuck, because we're, uh, cool like that.  




 Found your mom's dildo! 




 Found the wife!  




 I feel the same way when I'm having sex with her.  




 Bird is the word? 




 9 and 3 because race car. 




 The op with the tattoo should copyright the charmander picture so he can sue all of you for reproducing it lol 




 Just curious as to what equipment you've been using to mix or practice on that you don't know how to to set up your laptop.

Just a word of warning, set up a time before your gig so you can hook up all your equipment and make sure it works. A few days before the gig if possible, sinceb it sounds like you don't even have all the equipment you think you need. 

I'd also have a back up plan, like having a bunch of tracks prepped on a USB drive in case you can't hook up your laptop. I'd suggest setting them up in rekordbox if you're using CDJ's.   




 You must be young because you'll soon find out that owning a dick in Vegas is very expensive.  




 If I was a girl, I would not be bragging about sleeping with an idiot like will I am. 




 Well he IS in a Mets jersey.  




 Fuck the textbook industry! Bunch of crooks.  




 The clap!  




 Ha! Joke's on you. I've broken plenty of condoms and have never gotten my hands pregnant.  




 Is OP Paul Rudd? 




 Hold my balls, I'm going in.

FTFY
 




 Not trying to be a dick, but are you really asking people on the Internet how something "feels?"

I'd recommend going into a music store that would have the same model on display so you can test the feel.  




 Wouldn't this be more aptly called "core licks?" 




 Was THAT sarcastic?  




 LANAAAAAAAAA 




 Now my penis is depressed.  




 Does she jump into the toilet bowl before you have to pee? 




 It's more comfortable. 




 The biggest thing that everyone is overlooking is the fact that you would remember nothing from the future,  so it wouldn't make any difference when you "saved."

You would just wake up at your "save" point like any other day and continue on with life as you would always have.  




 People who work there are empowered to take care of the customer as they deem fit. It won't hurt the bottom line much if you realize just how many drinks get thrown out in a day.

Also, giving away a drink and then having that person, most likely, share their experience with friends or on social media is probably one of the cheapest (and most effective) type of marketing they can buy.
 




 If a place accepts tips then tip them. 




 Correct. The iced venti cup is 24oz. 




 He's got the right idea.  Coke is expensive, you know. 




 Fuck! They're on to us.  




 The air filter replacement prices are such a ripoff. You can buy them for much cheaper at almost any auto part store and replace it in a matter of minutes. A simple youtube search will yield instructions.

*on most cars. 




 Not to mention pubes. 




 That's what we call "gambling." 




 If you put it on your butthole, it will go numb. 




 And everyone wins. 


Wait, did I do that right?  




 From the title, I thought they discovered 100 billion barrels just out in a field somewhere.  




 Get away from him, he's foaming at the mouth!  




 What!? 




 I think I have that set as well. Not a bad set.

 You silly goose. The happiness lies in the experiences you share with people, while doing drugs, not in the drugs itself. 




 I would say professors have never seen the cleverest way to cheat because the cleverest cheater has never been

caught. 




 Ha! 




 OP is now dead from a car accident. 




 You can eat a lot of fish. 




 Golded, golded, golded.

Is it ironic yet?  




 Looks like you got golded again for it.

 When you bust before the picture fully loads and you didn't see any nudity because it loads top to bottom.

Man, I hate 56k.  




 Burger King is still in business?! 




 Remind me again second second base is? Is that hands stuff? 




 Clicked on the subreddit and the first 2 links were purple. Oops 




 I'm old school, I use a hand held torch.  




 That's a few seconds too long.  




 I rarely ever look at a person's username.  




 You should talk about ideals and your philosophy on life. You should let them share there point of view with you. If you end up sharing your life with this person then it's critical that you both have simular ideals about life. 

Gender roles, the belief (or lack of belief) in a god, ethics, food, long term life goals (like what/where you want to end up so that you'll feel happy), and family goals (like when/if you want marriage and kids). These are some heavy subjects but eventually you'll  want to discuss them. 




 I hate it when unexperienced guys sleep with virgins. They're always too eager and don't know how painful it can be. This is why I try to avoid virgins. 




 Meow meow meow 




 A+++++ would read again!!! 




 I sucked a dick for $20 bucks.  I'm not gay, but $20 bucks is $20 bucks.  




 Ne pas toucher.

 LA has underground trance and psytrance parties. 




 Some ways I've seen people tip:

* $1 per drink, regardless of price or effort.

* $1 per drink for drinks that only require pouring (ex. beer, a shot, a glass of wine, etc.)

* $1 per drink, and will increase with difficulty/complexity of drink being made. (Usually an arbitrary amount decided by the patron).

* Percentage of total (usually 20%).

**Bartenders:** How much do you expect to be tipped? What is the amount of tip that can be left, where you will still feel stiffed, even though a tip was left? Do you ever feel that, due to slow service or messing up an order, you deserved a lower than normal tip?

**Bar patrons:** How much do you tip your bartender and what is your reasoning behind it? 




 Cumming so hard that your spinal cord snaps and you lose consciousness while laying in a pool of your own liquid.  




 Some lives you kill more people.
