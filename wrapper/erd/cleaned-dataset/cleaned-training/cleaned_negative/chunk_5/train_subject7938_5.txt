 How do you feel about /r/circlejerk? 



















 Indeed annoying but doesn't that ruin the point of raiding? 









 lightning mortars, destroy wiz tower and then mass archer it. make sure to send in groups at a time so you don't get gia bombed

 I'm a townhall 8 




 I wonder why he quit. He could've done a lot of stuff with that base considering most of his defenses are maxed. 




 how exactly can you see his traps 




 I think he meant he liked your layout instead of the current one, which look too cartoony :). 









 It gets pretty annoying having to strain the same exact troops every time, imagine just hitting a button and boom barch is training already. 




 Well he is a new redditor so that could explain it. 









 Did not expect that. In my grade there are about 5 Jacks, and 4 Lily's 









 I believe it was [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogZ6bP_N5B0) war base that worked the best for me. Rarely got 3 stared by other townhall 5's and 6's, not sure why though. 









 I have no idea what you guys are talking about.. Literally 5 next's and boom 200k raid. Sometimes you get people with like 5k but when you keep nexting you get like tons of loot..
