 Can someone explain to me what the hell happened?  




 is anyone shocked by this?  





























 Ted Cruz is one of the most ( if not THE most) anti-gay senator. here is his record http://www.hrc.org/2016RepublicanFacts/ted-cruz

 





























 Fuck yes, they never should have been classified.  












































 Interesting job change.  
























 Yes but so far in everything that has come out Blatter hasn't been indicated. On top of that this is a man who has shown that he doesn't give a damn about PR or the press. This is also a man who I believe is smart enough to not get his hands dirty and leave it up to his lieutenants. So again the question is why resign now?  




 Why did he resign now? He just won reelection last week and appears to have the support of most FIFA members. This makes be think the FBI indictment is just the tip of the iceberg

 FIFA doesn't care about negative press, there is something more at work here.

 Wait do people not like TCU here?

 Wow, she looks great.  




 [Here's ABBA on American Bandstand in 1975](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVmKAkIKqPU). It is quite obvious that they are lip syncing because they are no where near the one microphone on stage. And on top of that Dick Clark then walks up there with a different microphone to ask them questions. Indicating that the mic on stage isn't even plugged in. 

 

















































 Most large Canadian cities have them.  

















































 you know what I mean  




 keep in mind there were enough votes in the house and senate to override a veto.  



















 Everytime I hear a statement from Blatter or FIFA I burst into laughter.  














 This has to be sarcasm  












































 You're right, It's probably more Milton than Roswell.

 Upper Class Rednecks is Highly Accurate for the Alpharetta/Roswell/Milton area 














 As a fellow Atlantan I'd have to agree. He is awesome.

 I don't think that will work.  




 this is awesome  





























 Or click the hide button if it really annoys you that much.  





















































































































































 Keep in mind that Charter is also buying Bright House Networks as well.  















































































 You also used the term resort  




 It's the term the original source used so I went with it 




 That's another thing. I though the mods didn't allow titles that didn't come from the original article.  




 Ok seriously WTF!!!!! I posted the ORIGINAL story the other day (http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/36xa1f/legislators_and_corporate_lobbyists_sponsored_by/ ) and no one upvoted it. Yet this rehashed piece of crap from is what gets upvoted? 

I don't give a damn about the karma, I just want the original superior story getting the recognition it deserves.  




 Well an Atlanta station has the original report. http://www.11alive.com/story/news/local/investigations/2015/05/21/investigators-legislators-and-corporate-lobbyists-meet-in-secret-at-georgia-resort/27695105/

The Savannah station just posted the transcript to there website (they don't have as big of a budget as the Atlanta station) 

 




 This is the original report http://www.11alive.com/story/news/local/investigations/2015/05/21/investigators-legislators-and-corporate-lobbyists-meet-in-secret-at-georgia-resort/27695105/ 









 The original report was from [11Alive WXIA-TV Atlanta](http://www.11alive.com/story/news/local/investigations/2015/05/21/investigators-legislators-and-corporate-lobbyists-meet-in-secret-at-georgia-resort/27695105/). The only thing WSAV News 3 Savannah did was edit it for themselves and post the transcript from the original report. 

 




 Exactly, I'm the one that posted the original source http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/36xa1f/legislators_and_corporate_lobbyists_sponsored_by/ 

It made me mad that it didn't get more recognition. I don't give a damn about the karma, I just wanted the story (the original story is much better IMO) out there.

 Praise to the Miami Herald for reporting this. While police brutality is being reported on often these days not nearly enough is mentioned about  brutality by prison/jail officers. 

 







































 I'm  glad I'm not the only one.
