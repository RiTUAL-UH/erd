 Yes, MSNBC is doing all kinds of stuff on him in a positive way,. Rachel Maddow has him on the show and reports about him  all the time. I just do not see these claims of media bias having any validity  what-so-ever. He's probably getting more coverage on MSNBC than any other candidate; republican or democrat.

I met in person and he helped me build a computer. (well actually he did all the work)

He is an awesome guy.  




 I think you are imagining things.

Who is  burying  the stories? What media outlets are ridiculing and misrepresenting him?  




  Despite media bias, which includes burying stories, misrepresentation, dismissal and ridicule

What are talking you about? I have seen no bias except by FOX of course. I think you are imagining things.

 A brilliant interview. Really showed a side of our president people needed to see.

Too bad most people won't. The will just freak that he said the word nigger. Where has our culture gone?

 I'm not supporting Hillalry. I am calling out you Bernie bots that conduct this daily circlejerk on reddit about the godliness of Bernie and the Satan like behavior of Hillary. 

I can tell you I won't support Bernie though. And the reason is not him. It's you. 

A group made up of blind supporters who blather endlessly over every word he says and condemns anyone or anything that does not worship him,   is called a cult. Sorry Nancy, I'm not joining any cults today.

 




 This isn't a news article. It's propaganda from his own site. So excusing me if I don't cum all over the screen like the rest of you Bernie bots in this never-ending circle jerk.  




 Aren't jokes supposed to be funny? 




 Get a room already. 




 Climb down off your soapbox there. You are going hurt yourself.

I have defended no one. I am just calling out you and this article's over-zealous circle.jerk 




 Tell me that next June after Hillary wins on the first ballot. 




 Excellent. :D 




 Let's give it a few more minutes. Let me know if it come through. 




 Check your email. It should have been sent immediately. Let me know if you don't get it. 




 Sure thing. I have been there and am thankful I can help others now. Good luck to you. :D 




 A $25 gift code for Pizza Hut has been sent to by email. 

May brighter days be in your future. :D 




 I agree. It is easy to get caught up in the hype. Some just want a woman on a bill and don't care who gets kicked off to make it happen. 




 Okay, PM your real name and email address and I will see what i can do. 




 Way cool. I will give him a call this week and have him come out. I so appreciate the help. I'll let you know how it worked out. :D 




 what pizza places are near you? 




 Thank you. Your post is all set. Good luck. :D 




 You know I read that headline wrong. I thought it said he worked to increase the wealth at the expense of the lower class. Glad to see that I was wrong.  




 I would very interested. I don't want to go to a carpet store and get taken advantage of. I got the carpet from a house we remolded. It is practically brand new. A carpet place would overcharge me I know. 

I work in the construction trade and we all do side jobs like this but I want a good a job. 

I would very much appreciate the reference.  




 This article says:

 At least 5,500 Coloradans crammed into a Denver gymnasium, an adjacent atrium, and lacrosse field Saturday night to hear presidential candidate and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders speak, in what is being reported as one of the biggest political rallies so far in the 2016 election cycle.

Hillary rally had an estimate of 5,500 - 7000 people. 

http://www.politicususa.com/2015/06/13/hillary-clinton-draws-biggest-crowd-2016-hopeful-nyc-rally.html

I have read three different numbers of the actual crowd but it was as large or larger than Bernie's. To say "one of the largest crowds" is very ambiguous and exaggerated on purpose.

 Makes a great bumper sticker, but that's it.  




 Horseshit! 

One of **his** biggest crowds. Not one of **the** biggest crowds. So he filled a high school gymnasium. Hillary had twice that many last week. 

Words like massive, astronautical, huge, and others like are being thrown about in extremely  exaggerated and misused. Have fun with your little circle jerk and watch as he fades into obscurity just like Ron Paul when you blathered over him.

 I had a bankruptcy ten years ago. I thought they only stayed on your record for seven years. I thought it might be advantageous to get a credit card just to try and rebuild my credit at my bank but I was turned down. Despite having 20 grand in my account for over a year now. The reason given was my bankruptcy.

Should that bankruptcy still  be on my record and do I need to take steps to get it removed? Any other tips on how to rebuild my credit would be welcome. I do not need the credit now. I just want it to be there should I ever need it.

 Today's thought of the day comes in form of an observation from a fictional alien from the planet K-PAX (a great Kevin Spacey movie)


The alien from K-PAX told the psychiatrist we have no laws and no lawyers. When asked by the psychiatrist how do we know right from wrong the alien replied:

-----------------


**Every being in the universe knows right from wrong. Let me tell you something. You humans, most of you, subscribe to this policy of an eye for an eye, a life for a life, which is known throughout the universe for its stupidity. Even your Buddha and your Christ had quite a different vision; but nobody's paid much attention to them, not even the Buddhists or the Christians. You humans, sometimes its hard to imagine youve made it this far.**

 There are some people that seem to post only from a few sites and they do not get banned for spamming. An example of this would be a porn site. My subreddit is not a porn subreddit but many of the people that post to it, are getting reported for spam. I feel it is an attack of some sort.  Is there anyway Ii can get the same exemption for my subscribers? Or anyway I can protect these users?
