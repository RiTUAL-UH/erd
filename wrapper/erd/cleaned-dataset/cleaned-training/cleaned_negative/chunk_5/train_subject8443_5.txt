 I've had a lot of trouble getting the H4n to play nice with anything. What do you use with the Zoom that works well? 




 In that price range I always suggest the Rode NTG 2. Its a fairly good mic for the price and I think it's better than the Sennheiser ME66, which is a similarly priced mic.  




 A Harvest Nope 




 To be honest in that price range I'm not sure. I've used the NTG2 and NTG3 with the H4N and my biggest issue has always been that Phantom power is supplied to both xlr ports or neither. That being said the h6 is supposed to have new preamps right? I think the quality of the preamps are definitely most of the reason in price jumps before you add timecode. 
I have used Sound Devices MixPre and 302 with the H4N and they don't play nice together. 
Sound devices makes some sick toys like their new 633 mixer/recorder. Obviously way put of the H4n range but you can dream right?
