 I do believe it is just some emotes and the Poseidon and Neith skins.  




 I must now do this... I was firetruck to victory~! 




 I would really love the SWC Ares Skin! My favorite god is Geb, his woohoo on G.E.B 1 is glorious and that feeling you get when you shield save is awesome.  




 Larry the Sea Serpent and Karl the Siege Monster 




 Need to add a nothing option 




 So I guess we all care! 




 Geb's roll out lasts forever and when roll out is active he ults around him 




 What server was this on?
 




 Currently 6496 on Frostmourne....BRING IT ON (This could take like 8 hours) 




 I would be a great game to play, although atm not really due to the lag and queues because of the new expansion release, best to give it some time to die down. 




 Last moment saves as Geb in a premade conquest 




 I shall achieve this skin somehow 




 Unless you get in a queue with people like me who want to get support xD, it's a rare occasion to have two people call support. 




 You'd be best just playing it anyway and learning, try to explain to people you're trying to learn conquest since you don't play it much, a few will still BM and a few will understand, but even if you go 20-0 there with be somebody going 1-13 who BM's you. 




 This sounds like a scam... will you do it for 0.03 instead? 




 It is wonderful! How much for this piece? 




 Atleast make the shot a clean one so I don't suffer for a long time burning 




 9mm rounds
