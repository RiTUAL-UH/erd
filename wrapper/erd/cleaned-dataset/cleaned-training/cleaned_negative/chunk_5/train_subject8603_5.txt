 Too much Korra? 




 Did a little more detectiving and answered my own question.  




 You are not who I assumed you were. Reveal yourself! 




 Yo. 




 Yup! It was the closest big empty space I could think of. Kinda wish I had thought to go to Tom Brown or a Greenway, but I think it turned out okay. 









 Knowing the retconned it in the movies has ruined it for me. 




 I was expecting this one. http://i.imgur.com/8orgM.jpg 




 I live in Tallahassee, FL. While I understand that legally I am obliged by the lease, receiving a note saying that I have an extra 3 days to pay rent is huge, especially for a poor college student. The current managers claim to have been there since the beginning of June, and they didn't seem to have a problem with payment on the 5th last month. Now I'm just thinking it was some sort of ploy from the previous owners now just to throw in one last monkey wrench into a sinking ship. 




 New apartment managers are trying to screw me by saying I owe a late fee, even though the month prior we had received a note saying that the rent due date had been changed to the 5th, with even the receptionist confirming that was the case. Paid rent on the 5th of June without issue. This month, go in to the office to pay rent on the 5th only to be informed that we owed a late fee because our rent was due on the 2nd, as per the original lease contract that was signed with the 3rd or 4th previous apartment management company. Management seems to change every couple months, so its incredibly confusing. I no longer have the original note stating the change of due date, but I'm hoping one of our neighbors still does. Any advice? 




 Sanded and primed the table. Then taped with masking tape and used a metallic blue acrylic paint. 




 Yesss. I love Portlandia. 




 I'm extremely appreciative of the story, but I'd rather not give out my name. I already have friend's asking me to do their furniture. I really don't need strangers doing the same thing. lol.  




 It was actually in really good condition. Here's the progress pics. http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/w0c60/redid_some_furniture_i_found_in_a_dumpster/c597smu 




 I really like the blue and orange table. If I do another one I'll definitely consider that!
