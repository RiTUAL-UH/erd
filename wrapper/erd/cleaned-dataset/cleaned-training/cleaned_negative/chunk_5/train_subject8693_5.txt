 The one on the right looks like he's given up. 














 Holy shit, I can smell burning euphoria through my computer. 




 That's a lot of clean-up for some fake internet points.

 Honestly, I'd have to say Snape. 




 That's impressive! 




 Thank you so, so much friend. Like I said in my post, I'll repay your kindness once I'm back on my feet. This means a lot to me. 




 I appreciate the kind words, its nice knowing I'm not the only one who feels this way. *hugs* 




 Thank you for the kind words :) *Hug* 




 My name's Josh. I have OCD, GSA, depression, ADD, insomnia, and bipolar disorder. I'm out of work because of it, and its made mine and my family's life very hard. I'm currently seeing a therapist and psychiatrist, who are working with me step by step.

I'm here to ask for help. My anxiety has been getting harder and harder to cope with, and I need help. When I was working I would sometimes visit a natural market and buy powdered valerian root to make tea, it would ease my anxiety and I loved it because it was all natural. I'm hoping someone here can sympathize and understand how horrible dealing with these problems can be, and can extend a helping hand. I will in turn repay you for your kindness when I'm able to, though I'm not sure when that will be. I have an appointment with my psych next week and were supposed to discuss my med regimen.

I'm asking if someone can pay for this powdered valerian they sell on Amazon. Its about $10 including shipping, and 4oz lasts a long time. Somebody please help me, I'm tired of crying because I can't deal with my anxiety.

 This is my all-time favorite Bertstrip ever. 




 Psycho. That movie set the precedent for horror films for generations to come.
