 It's hard to tell, but from my what I've seen from Manning this season, I just highly doubt he has another season in him. But the question is, who are you grabbing at QB towards the end of the 1st round that has the potential to be a franchise QB? 




 There's actually a documentary about him that's pretty interesting. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1352717/

"John Cazale was in only five films - The Godfather, The Conversation, The Godfather, Part Two, Dog Day Afternoon, and The Deer Hunter - each was nominated for Best Picture. Yet today most people don't even know his name. I KNEW IT WAS YOU is a fresh tour through movies that defined a generation."

Edit: Wow, I didn't expect my simple post to blow up that much. Also, thanks for the gold! 




 Crash Bandicoot is the Mario of Sony for me. I miss that guy. 




 See, I read this as "Yes...if Peyton Manning is still here." Do you think DT wants to spend the prime of his career with Osweiler/whoever else we come up with? I think it sounds nice, but I would guess we need to pay up if Peyton retires after this season. 




 Well, that's certainly better than a 24 hour marathon of just Deer Hunter. 




 Thanks! It's normally two of my friends, one is my high school best friend and he's 23. The other one is a friend who started doing this with us a few years back and he's 28. Other friends come in and out for certain movies, mainly Die Hard. 




 Absolutely. I think it's thankfully gained a lot of kitsch value over the years, probably from people my age who grew up with it.
