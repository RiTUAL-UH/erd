 Just wondering.  




 Titanic  




 The Killers 




 Of Monsters and Men

 And Titanic  




 Why does Luke run into Vadar when he's training with Yoda and see himself in the mask? 




 Can you imagine watching Gravity up there? It'd be so scary I imagine especially when Sandra Bullocks floating through space in all those scenes.  




 Chris Evans  




 Just wondering.  









 Just wondering.  




 Saw, when he stands up and the music is going crazy.

 Saw  









 "I'm the king of the world!" 




 Ya that ones my least favorite after seeing this one.

 Help
