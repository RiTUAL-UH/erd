 Marry me. You are beautiful 




 My main is an asura thief named Lil'Stealthy. Some time ago I played WoW and I loved rogues. Thief just reminds me of the time when I played that pay-to-play game. Now I am happy to say that GW2 is better! You know the addiction to WoW you get when you play it. I had it but now with the help of GW2 everything changed :)
 




 I would really love to get a key
