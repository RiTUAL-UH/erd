 I completely and absolutely disagree!

The Chinese are a communist state and could harness whatever they needed for their opening.  It was spectacular, but as I was watching it, I thought "at what cost?"

The Brits had a terrific opening themselves, and free world.  

However, it was their closing ceremony that I will always remember.

Beat this, anybody free or commie:

 Only during sports and reality shows.

Fun anecdote: when Survivor was a cultural thing, in the season 2 finale, I was watching with my windows open.  Runner-up Colby made a decision that guaranteed him not to win (he took Tina to the final two).  

As soon as he did it, I yelled "YOU FUCKING MORON!" out of frustration and anger at the top of my lungs... and could hear people up and down my block laughing.   




 I re-checked -- yup somebody posted it in there, but only part 2.  Only 18 upvotes.   

I dunno.

I absolutely love /r/truereddit -- you have great taste in r/'s.   




 I'm kind of happy about this.  Uber's great but I never liked how it puts the costs   benefits of driving for them onto the newbie drivers.  It's not a career driving for Uber.   









 I thought this was a fake due to the euro style of printing of the phone number with a period instead of a dash...

but apparently it's true:

 All I can say is that we were both in ski boots, which is a great equalizer.  

I imagine he wears higher heels or lifts when in day to day public. 

Nothing wrong with this at all -- he needs to project his larger than life persona and I wouldn't fault him.  

I'm just saying I think he's naturally shorter than me -- I, too, was surprised to find this.  

He's still a big MF. 




  Aleksa Palladino

I have been in love with her since her arc in Boardwalk Empire.  I don't speak metric, but an online converter says she's 5.74147 feet and that Lee Pace of 195cm is 6.39764 feet tall.  That's about right actually.

I'm 5'11" and a 5'7" girl would be roughly at the level of my nose.  Had I grown another four inches, shoulder is about right. 




 He speaks in a Texas "good ole boy" vernacular.  It's not important.  He rarely says what he really means.  Those guys speak in visual cues.  I love them. 




 I'm old enough to remember Jolt cola, the Red Bull/Monster too early energy drink -- this is the soda can Gordon speared at the beginning.

I had one once.  Once. 




 Rumor on Dexter: the reason he became a lumberjack is because as a child in that container, he watched his mother get dismembered by a chainsaw.

I just heard this today and was all Sudden Clarity Clarence.

 




 I bet the Turner family isn't going to let GRRM anywhere near that cute doggie. 




 Really?  If I don't hear the confirmation beep, I try to rescan it once or twice, and then the driver usually nods me back into seating. 

I've never been yelled at by a Metrobus driver. 




 Here you go:

 That's exactly it for me.  The Orioles seem nice enough but OMG how I hate their owner. 




 If you haven't read this two-part long-form article on the investigation into Silk Road, this is a must-read:

http://www.wired.com/2015/04/silk-road-1/

http://www.wired.com/2015/05/silk-road-2/

I read them in the print edition. Force is a major character, but I don't remember anything about Bridges.
 




 OK Mythbusters, solve this one. 




 I don't know where they'd fit.  Too long for new, I'm sure tech's already seen them, and I think I saw them on truereddit -- I was suprised because I had to wait a month between part 1 and 2 for the next issue to arrive -- I subscribe -- and there it was online.

The formatting of the print articles was really interesting so I waited it out.   




 YAY they remembered us in DC! 




  If a 1960s show is rerun today, the content may be edited by nine minutes to make room for the extra advertisements.

This really infuriates me.

Anyhow, I DVR basically everything and ffwd through the commericals.   




 I've met Schwarzenegger while skiing.  I'm 5'11" and he's shorter than me.  Maybe 5'9".

I have never seen shoulders that wide though, even under a ski jacket.   




 Staged.  Why would the frisbee thrower throw it to the dog? 




 The celtic chief probably trusted a lieutenant to bury them, then the Romans killed anybody who knew where they were buried. 




 I really hope somebody remembers this article when it comes time to hand out the Pulitzers.  Not only did the journalist write a compelling true crime piece, but also explained the technology seamlessly, not to mention the applicable laws.   




 I have it -- is that what caused it? 




 Holy crap you're right.  All three were about the same age -- Gable was six years older.

 




 For anybody with interest, this is a must-read:

http://www.wired.com/2015/04/silk-road-1/

I read them in the print edition.  Force is a major character, but I don't remember anything about Bridges.   




 That's terrific!  Choreographing that must've been like planning D-Day.

 I would like to see a burning squib.  I've always wondered what a squib is.

https://books.google.com/books?id=FRbrl0pI_VcC pg=PA26 lpg=PA26 dq=tort+squib source=bl ots=22nEyRh3k5 sig=39LgobiCvTosOWIEp2VnktddUfo hl=en sa=X ei=9j-DVbCXErCHsQTT5aP4Bg ved=0CDcQ6AEwBg#v=onepage q=tort%20squib f=false 




 I'd go see it, too, if I was in the area one day.

I'd wear a Ford Pinto Owners' Association T-shirt though. 




 Still there?  I'm typing to you from a rainy Georgetown.  Do you ever miss DC? 




 Maybe they should've planted a callback?  I dunno.  It's still a pretty bad finale. 




 They could even take away his red stapler. 




 I gave up on the first season for that reason.  The red herring of the Muslim school teacher?  I was out. 




 Whoa.  Thank you for that!

 




 Ah he wasn't a draft dodger by any stretch.  He was 34 when Pearl Harbor was bombed.  That being said, he didn't exert himself to serve.  I have read that the WWII vets resented him for all of his war movies.

From wiki:

America's entry into World War II resulted in a deluge of support for the war effort from all sectors of society, and Hollywood was no exception. Wayne was exempted from service due to his age (34 at the time of Pearl Harbor) and family status, classified as 3-A (family deferment). He repeatedly wrote John Ford saying he wanted to enlist, on one occasion inquiring whether he could get into Ford's military unit, but consistently kept postponing it until after "he finished just one or two pictures".[4]:212 Wayne did not attempt to prevent his reclassification as 1-A (draft eligible), but Republic Studios was emphatically resistant to losing him; Herbert J. Yates, President of Republic, threatened Wayne with a lawsuit if he walked away from his contract,[4]:220 and Republic Pictures intervened in the Selective Service process, requesting Wayne's further deferment.[4]:213

Wayne toured U.S. bases and hospitals in the South Pacific for three months in 1943 and 1944.[4]:253 with the USO[27][28][29] By many accounts, Wayne's failure to serve in the military was the most painful experience of his life.[4]:212 His widow later suggested that his patriotism in later decades sprang from guilt, writing: "He would become a 'superpatriot' for the rest of his life trying to atone for staying home."[30]

U.S. National Archives records indicate that Wayne had, in fact, made an application [31] to serve in the OSS, today's equivalent of the CIA, and had been accepted within the U.S. Army's allotted billet to the OSS. William Donovan, OSS Commander, wrote Wayne a letter informing him of his acceptance in to the Field Photographic Unit, but the letter went to his estranged wife Josephine's home. She never told him about it.[32] Donovan also issued an OSS Certificate of Service to Wayne.[33] 




 Yeah I saw the one with 37 miles (kilometers?) on the odometer and thought the same thing.

It's a Toyota.  Of course it'll eventually start. 




 I lived in London in '89 and can't donate either.   




 Fun fact: in the movie Invictus, Mandela gives a copy of the poem Invictus to the rugby captain.

In real life, Mandela gave him this speech. 




 Erin Cummings -- Sparty's wife in Spartacus -- is in the mix, too.   




 Yeah I know.  Armed guards in a very tight space.  I'd had too much vodka the night before.  It would've been a real problem. 

































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































 *What's the problem?*   
I reformatted my computer three weeks ago.  Never ending RES used to get me to 1000 or more and is now conking out at 200. 

Just now I got "There doesn't seem to be anything here! (Why not?)" at 25.



*What other browser extensions are installed?*  
On Firefox: AdBlock, BetterPRivacy, FEBE, Ghostery, HTTPS-Everywhere, NoScript, NoSquint, RES, SecureSanitzer, TinEye, and the only new addition to my line-up YouTube High Definition 36.0.

Except for YouTube HD, this was my exact line-up pre-reformatting.  

Is there anything I can do to get back to seeing never ending reddit displaying deep into the 800's?


*Did you read the known issues and search /r/RESissues?*  
Yes but nothing seemed current.
