 I'm always finding klingons in the showers. Hurt like all hell getting them loose.  




 Fun Fact! That quote was supposedly said by PT Barnum, the american showman famous for his ability to sell anything. However, in reality, it was attributed to him by an enemy who want to help create the notion that Barnum was a swindler, taking his audiences for a ride.  




 Nah, naivety gets you poor. 

 




 I've just spent the last two months doing press for a novel I wrote about con artists in Melbourne who pull this exact scam in the first chapter!  














 I was actually there with my ten month old. 

I was going to stick her in the photo too but then I remember I'm not really the kind of guy who whores out his daughter for karma. 




 Thanks. I'm more after a stylist who can take me to several shops (and the right shop for my body type)/ 









 I need a new suit for performing in and I'm sick I've all missing the mark. 

I'm looking for someone who really knows their stuff to offer some pro advice on getting the best clothes for my purposes. 

 









 Cheers, I signed up over a decade ago and kept forgetting to change. 

The authcode section of the site didn't work so I had to call and get it emailed to me. 

I went with Uber in the end. Fingers crossed.  




 I registered a few domains with Melbourne IT back when they were the only game in town. 

Since I don't want to pay $150 when I can pay $30, I'm trying to change.

However, I've been on hold for 40 minutes to customer support.

I called sales on my wife's phone while I was waiting and got put through within 20 seconds. 

 




 Do you have any concrete examples? 
 




 In America yes. 

It is a direct result of the quiz show scandals back in the fifties.

 That film had a lot of great moments. Sadly, they didn't come together into a great film. 




 Leon: The Professional  Garden State  V For Vendetta

After the death of lone wolf hitman Leon, Mathilda grows up to become a pathological liar giving her the skills to work for the facist state run television until she meets V and is intrigued by the lone wolf revolutionary as he reminds her of Leon from he childhood. 




 It's more of an ironic hell than heaven.

Want sugar? HAVE ALL THE SUGAR YOU CAN EAT BWHAHAHA!  




 According to this interview a few months before his death, he only did it because he REALLY loved trains.

 Source? 




 The trouble both films have is [spoilers](#s "making it believable that the two leads could be forced into falling in love. In the original, they resort to "because hypnosis is magic" which works reasonably well and we suspend our disbelief. In the remake, I just don't buy that his plan could be so reliant on the pair sleeping together. There are so many "But what if" moments for it to really work. ") 




 I agree, that was quite disturbing.  









 From IMDB

*The DVD contains a FAKE alternate ending where Average Joe's loses the final match and the film goes to the credits as the announcer exclaims that they are going home with absolutely nothing. This was apparently sacked after test audiences were unhappy with the original ending (Globo Gym wins).* 




 I don't buy it.

It makes no sense, isn't particular funny AND, if you watch the ending on the DVD, it is exactly the same as the final scene, it just slows down and fades to black with Stiller jumping around having won.

I always assumed it was a joke for the DVD extras. 




 The movie moved from family drama to taught home invasion thriller to schlock horror so fast I felt disorientated by the end. That said, I still loved it.

I'm the kind of person who gets half way through a Diane Keaton family dramedy and wishes they'd started knocking people off.

 I'm glad OP wasn't a douche in that edit.  




 ...or the last ten minutes of The Mist.  




 This is a long but fascinating look at the film and the director's experience of being African American in America. 

The issue and ideas are far more complicated than the knee-jerk reactions you see on the comments for the trailer.

 Isn't that the plot of Shane Maloney's The Brush Off? 




 I'm not sure I understand WHY you want longer chapters. It is a little like asking how to use the letter P more often.  




 Thanks. It was freezing that day and my hands kept cramping.  









 I concur.  




 No, but I like that song. 




 No, much older. 




 Bit more obscure than that 




 This is my thing, if anyone spots them in Melbourne, send me an email at info@conman.com.au

 No - this song is a little slower and folkier. Thanks though! 




 A male singer singing what feels like a ballad. It has a Neil Young or Scott Walker vibe.

Includes lyrics something like:

"Goodbye my only/lonely friend, when will I see you again"
And another line about "pictures/painting on the wall"

 You're Next starts as a family drama, turns into a home invasion thriller then ends as a comedy horror schlock fest.

 Who is he? I need some sweet old man action.

 




 My tap has been leaking from the base. I've pulled it aparted and discovered the o-ring is very loose. I'm not stretching the o-ring in the photo below. It hangs this loose.

Trouble is, I don't know the brand and no hardware store or supply shop can help me.

Any ideas?

 Perhaps if you are a wild animal or a human long ago.

The beauty of human's evolution of the past few thousand years is we have grown to appreciate intelligence OVER base aggression. 

It is why people, as well as physical attraction, also look for wit and intelligence. The ability to rape is not really something either men or women look for much anymore.

Probably best to remove it from the 'special skills' of your OK cupid profile.

 




 Evolution is not always progressive.  




 It's really not. It's no different from putting extra peanuts in a snickers.

 The Heat ($159,578,352) Gravity ($274,084,95) and The Blindeside ($255,950,375) were Bullock's last three films. 




 But why would he? That would make him a terrible person. 




 I've started avoided IMDB for old series so I don't find out who stays and leaves by their episode count. 




 Vlados is insane. You get a single sausage for entree, a steak for main and a strawberry pancake for dessert. That's it. If you want salad you get a whole of iceburg lettuce covered in vinegar.

 Will do.

 I don't think enough time has passed for this to be either interesting or nostalgically funny. Maybe hang on to it for another couple of decades. 




 Thanks! 




 So the gun would still have some kind of stunning facility even with the cartridge in AND the blast doors obstructed? 




 So it would act as a regular stun gun?

EDIT: I can't see them in any of the pictures. Are they very small?

http://store.taser.com/taser-x26c-p117.aspx
 




 My understanding was that you had to remove the cartridge first.  




 I'm not a gun person so please excuse my ignorance. In fact, I'm not even sure a taser *counts* as a gun.

What would happen if you pushed a Taser into a solid surface (the ground, a wall or even a person's chest) and pulled the trigger?

As I understand it, Taser cartridges have blast doors on them that swing open or blow off when the gun is fired, allowing the prongs to fly out.

http://www.taser.com/products/law-enforcement/taser-cartridges

If the Taser was pushed up against a solid surface, I can't see how those doors could open.

If a Taser was pushed hard into someone's chest, what would happen?

NOTE: This is different from the stun gun that REQUIRES you push the gun up against someone.
 




 But...why? 




 I wouldn't know. I have done all I can to block that film from my mind. Every now and then I have vague flashes of mullets and saxophone solos but that's it. 




 Remember the eighties and early nineties? We have nuns doing all sorts of crazy stuff for laughs back then. Salad days my friends, salad days. 




 Get. Out. 




 "Get on the cones." That's a phrase I've not heard in a while.  




 A Last of Us vibe? 




 Yeah, I love that place. SHows up in a lot of movies too. 




 Oh absolutely, I'm not going for realism.  




 thanks! Good lead. 




 Ha! Gritty realism.  




 Of course, I'm writing my second novel (www.chasingtheace.com.au is the first) and it is set in Sydney. I'm setting a scene in an abandoned space and would like to use a genuine location. 

My 'intended use' would be a drug deal. :)




 




 I asked this questions a few months back, got some great answers but then discovered all of the places suggested were being redeveloped. (Rozelle Tram Depot, Edwin Davey   Sons Flour Mill etc.)

Any other cool places? 




 That was equally parts hilarious and depressing. 

However, sadly, the story didn't come close to Tony's real problems, instead focusing on his Bush style gaffs. 

Imagine if they'd discussed the budget, the refugee policy, the drug tests for dole seekers, the scholarship scandal...  









 That's how it starts.... 




 No, that's what makes them boutique and craft. Hence the word 'microbrewery'.
