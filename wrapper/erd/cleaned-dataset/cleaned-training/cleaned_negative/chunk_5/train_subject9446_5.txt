 Very useful. Some stuff on there I'd not come across before - or certainly not in such a succinct form.

Inevitably things get lost in translation however. I like the Pali and Sanskrit words for the brahma-viharas. Particularly *mudita*. Not a word we have a direct equivalent to in English. I'd translate it as 'experiencing happiness in the happiness of others'. A lot of the Sanskrit and Pali origins are well worth checking out further.

Seeing the delight of others in this cheat sheet is a good opportunity to bask in some mudita, mind. :)

 Remember the fuss about a Danish cartoon depicting the prophet Muhammad? I still think the anger of some Muslims silly. But inexplicable? Ive had to think again.

[...]Dorothy L Sayers [was suggested as a topic] for my Radio 4 series 'Great Lives'. Sayers, a committed Anglican, wrote a cycle of plays about Jesus, 'The Man Born to be King', which the BBC broadcast in the 1940s. There was outrage. Heres the Lords Day Observance Society, whose formal complaint to the BBC spoke  believe it or not  for many conservative Christians:

Christian people have been shocked at the announcement of the proposed impersonation of our Lord Jesus Christ in a Sunday Play on the wireless . . . the first time a radio impersonation of Christ has been attempted anywhere in the world . . . bordering on the blasphemous . . . a contemplated violation of the Third Commandment which forbids taking the Name of God in vain.

That was little more than 70 years ago. Today we would struggle to understand how there could even have been an issue. Listen now and the only thing that might surprise you is how posh theyve made Jesus: He sounds like a Conservative MP.

Piya Tan glosses it along the lines of 'don't turn the Buddhist teachings/way of life into a commercial enterprise'.

I think it could be understood to have a metaphysical as well as an ethical dimension. The Dharma should be its own reward. You don't follow the Dharma to receive something other than the Dharma; you act according to the Dharma and consequently it is the Dharma you receive. 

A banana trader would expect to receive, say, money for his bananas. A devotee of the Buddha who expects to trade the Dharma for money in a similar fashion would be acting wrong-headedly.

 *L'esprit de l'escalier* literally translates as 'the spirit of the stairs'. The saying evokes passing someone on a flight of stairs and wanting to have said something but only thinking of it a few moments too late as, say, you have gone up and they have gone down. One only realises the best thing to say after more time spent thinking (conscious rumination or subconscious gestation). I was punning on 'stairs'. Both stairs, and 'reflection and doing nothing' elevate one.

Edit: I remember now that the pun worked on another level too: *l'espirit d'escalier* is the key to going deeper. Typical *l'esprit d'escalier* - remembering to add this now! 




 I know that's how it's used. I was deliberately being more expansive.

 Good to hear. 




 Specifically referring to allegations of torture:

**The Winter Soldier Investigation**

In Detroit in 1971, several soldiers described incidents of torture, though they
refused to name the soldiers who had tortured.^51 ... They gave their own names and
presented their discharge papers, identifying when and where they had served,
and they detailed when and where torture occurred. The soldiers at Winter
Soldier did not describe bizarre tortures never reported elsewhere, as in other
accounts, and at least as far as torture is concerned, there is nothing here to
make one question Senator Mark Hatfields decision to read this account into
the Congressional Record in 1971....

Steve Noetzel offers the earliest account of American telephone torture,
situating it in the Mekong Delta region between 1963 and 1964.^52 Soldiers who
served in the mid-1960s repeatedly mention telephone torture and less commonly
beating. There are two accounts describing the use of dogs in torture
and singular accounts of suspension, water torture, and ear boring.^53 One soldier
describes an incident of field interrogation using knives in which the prisoner
was killed because the medics would have become suspicious.^54

Don Dzagulones, a former military interrogator, gave the most detailed
account of interrogation and torture. Dzagulones described field telephone torture
as well as dehydration, which left nothing that was traceable.^55 As in
other testimonials, Dzagulones does not mention official training for torture.
Rather, he describes how commanders in Vietnam exercised benign neglect
(If people did find out about it, they just let it go, because it was an accepted
practice). He also describes how he learned techniques... after the official instructors turned the class over to Vietnam
veterans (invariably the instruction would turn to various methods that
theyd seen or heard or used in torturing people in Vietnam).^56 ...

Let me turn now to the criticisms of Winter Soldier. Guenter Lewy has
sharply questioned the accounts soldiers provided. In particular, he sharply criticized
the unwillingness of soldiers to name those who committed war crimes,
arguing that in American jurisprudence, guilt is always personal. Lewy also
summarized the results of the investigation of the Winter Soldier allegations by
the Naval Investigative Service. The most damaging finding consisted of the
sworn statements of several veterans, corroborated by witnesses, that they had
in fact not attended the hearing in Detroit. One of them had never been in
Detroit all his life. He did not know, he stated, who might have used his name.
The report also identifies another soldier, an African-American, who asserted
that a member of the Nation of Islam helped him prepare his testimony.^59

But the appearance of exactitude here is deceptive. Unlike other critics,
such as Sheehan and Moyar, who have exposed fabricators by name using unclassified
military files, Lewy does not give the names of the fake speakers at
Winter Soldier, and guilt, as he so correctly states, is an individual matter. Collective
sin belongs to theology, not history, and it is a mistake to tar everyone
at Winter Soldier with the faults of specific individuals. In 2004, Lewy was no
longer certain whether he saw the file that described these allegations. In an
interview with the Baltimore Sun, Lewy states that he does not recall if he saw
a copy of the naval investigative report or was briefed on its contents.^60 The
cursory bibliographic information, which offers neither the date of the investigation
nor a reference number, suggests he never saw it.


Efforts to find this file have thus far failed. The Suns reporters were not
able to secure it, and Paul ODonnell, the spokesman for the Naval Criminal
Investigative Service, reported that they were searching for a copy of the report.
^61 In addition, a military librarian with access to classified databases was
unable to find the file listed in any database. Perhaps one day a FOIA request
will recover this file and two other files Lewy cites.

The lack of names, the probable oral character of the summary, and the
absence of the hard copy raise troubling questions about Lewys allegations.
Furthermore, during the 2004 presidential campaign, conservative groups put
a great deal of energy into finding anyone who would discredit the Winter
Soldier investigations. If, as Lewy insists, there were veterans who were outraged
that someone used their name falsely to make claims of atrocities in Vietnam,
this was the time for them to have come forward. But by the end of fall 2004,
only one soldier came forward, Steven J. Pitkin.^62 If Pitkins account is true,
it does not fit the allegations in the NIS file. Pitkin does not state someone
impersonated him at Winter Soldier; rather he retracts the account he offered
there. So where were the several soldiers whose were so outrageously impersonated
at Winter Soldier? And where was the African American who had received
help from the Nation of Islam in preparing his testimony?


There are also troubling questions about the Pitkin affidavit. Pitkin apparently
filed his affidavit twice. His first affidavit was filed on August 31, 2004,
and it was immediately contested. Another veteran, Scott Camil, filed his own
affidavit on September 11, 2004, pointing to falsehoods in the Pitkin affidavit.^63
Pitkin subsequently filed a new affidavit on September 15, 2004. This new affidavit
was surprising in its own right since his close friend from the 1970s, Nancy
Miller Saunders, believed he was dead.^64 At any rate, Pitkins new affidavit states
that he falsely described incidents of rape, brutality, atrocities and racism at
the urging of presidential candidate John Kerry.^65 This is problematic for another
reason: Pitkins statement at Winter Soldier does not describe incidents
of rape, brutality, or other atrocities. Pitkin speaks thrice in the transcripts of
Winter Soldier. The first and longest testimony is a generic statement about
the dehumanization caused by war. Here, Pitkin uses the word atrocity to describe
U.S. press coverage and his army training stateside, but not to describe
specific incidents of violence in Vietnam...


One last fact raises questions about the political motivation behind the
affidavit. Pitkin is the easiest veteran to associate with John Kerry at Winter
Soldier because he is the only one to appear with him on film. It is thought provoking
that given all the soldiers Lewy claims were impersonated at Winter
Soldier, only and especially Pitkin came forward to denounce it.


At the moment, then, Pitkins affidavit seems unreliable and Lewys claims
about Winter Soldier are as nearly hearsay as the ones he is criticizing. Recently,
a group of anti-Kerry veterans have received and made available some
21,477 pages of FBI documents on the Vietnam Veterans Against the War.^67
Perhaps in time, the lost file or FBI files similar to it will appear, allowing one
to identify the liars. But the continued absence of the Naval Investigative File
suggests that Lewys contact deliberately misled him and Lewy mistakenly
found the contact convincing.


Two other features of Lewys discussion of torture are also troubling, suggesting
that his assessment of American torture in Vietnam is less than evenhanded.
Despite his criticism of testimonials about American torture in South
Vietnam, Lewy is quick to accept testimonial literature when it pertains to
Communist torture. Unable to show North Vietnamese government documents
authorizing torture, he argues nevertheless that the uniformity in the
testimonial literature suggests that torture was government policy. Lewy faults
gullible antiwar criticism, arguing that they should have known the North Vietnamese
would torture given past testimonials about Communist practice during
the Korean and Franco-Vietnamese wars.^68

This is the standard application of the Nuremberg rule of course: uniformity
of practice indicates uniformity of intent. Indeed, there are important continuities
in Communist torture practices, although the testimonial literature
also indicates significant variations during the Vietnamese and Korean conflicts,
as I document in chapters 3 and 17. Lewy is right to criticize the antiwar
critics on this point. By the same token, however, the French tortured in Vietnam
as did the South Vietnamese, and the uniform pattern for the latter also
strongly suggested that the South Vietnamese had an official torture policy too.
Lewy mentions South Vietnamese torture in one sentence, stating only that the
ARVN was known for their bad treatment and torture of captured VC. Lewy
does not even mention French torture during the Vietnamese conflict.^69

It seems odd that Lewy applies one set of rules for acceptable evidence and
interpretation for Communist torture and quite another for American torture.
Lewy is correct that retrospective testimony about the past is highly problematic,
but so too is proximate testimony. Proximity to the incident may occlude
judgment and perspective, and the real situation may become more apparent
with time. General Massu believed that torture was effective and necessary at
the time he acted in Algeria, but came, correctly, to the opposite conclusion
thirty years later. Does this mean his later testimony is false or unreliable? Again,
it is rather surprising that Lewy does not even mention this possibility, seeking
to rule out all retrospective testimonial literature in principle when it comes to
American veterans testimonies of torture.^70 ... 

Ultimately though,
the testimonial evidence does not disagree too much with the position Lewy
wants to defend, namely, that torture was not official government policy issued
from Washington, DC. The testimonial evidence describes instead a local,
semiofficial policy that existed for all the reasons Lewy outlines.

 I googled a name at random off that CID document. He still upheld his testimony in an interview in 2010. 

More convincingly, the book *Torture and Democracy* by Darius Rejali contains the following passage in the Appendix - 'A Note on Sources for American Torture during
the Vietnam War':

 **1 January, 1839**. Talked of my getting on in Oliver Twist; of the descriptions
of squalid vice in it; of the accounts of starvation in the Workhouses and
Schools, Mr. Dickens gives in his books. Lord M[elbourne - the Prime Minister] says, in many schools they
give children the worst things to eat, and bad beer, to save expense; told him
Mamma admonished me for reading light books.

**Sunday, 7th April 1839.** Lord M. was talking of some dish or other, and
alluded to something in Oliver Twist; he read half of the 1st vol. at Panshanger.
Its all among Workhouses, and Coffin Makers, and Pickpockets, he said; I
dont like that low debasing style; its all slang; its just like The Beggars Opera;
I shouldnt think it would tend to raise morals; I dont like that low debasing
view of mankind. We defended Oliver very much, but in vain. I dont like
those things; I wish to avoid them; I dont like them in reality, and therefore
I dont wish to see them represented, he continued; that everything one read
should be pure and elevating. Schiller and Goethe would have been shocked
at such things, he said. Lehzen said they would not have disliked reading
them. She dont know her own literature, said Lord M., for that Goethe
said one ought never to see anything disagreeable; he wouldnt look upon
the dead; and thats just the same thing. Its a bad taste, he continued,
which will pass away like any other, but depend upon it, while it lasts its a
bad, depraved, vicious taste; now just read Jonathan Wild, he said to Lord
Torrington, and Amelia, and see if it isnt just the same thing.
