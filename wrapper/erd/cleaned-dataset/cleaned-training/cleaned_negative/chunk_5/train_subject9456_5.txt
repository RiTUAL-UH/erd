 Yes.. Your muscles retain memory. Known as "muscle memory" I recommend easing your body back in to a routine.. But you will notice increased ability (ie strength, endurance etc) in all areas at a much rapid pace. Take your time and focus on form. 




 I'm going to keep things simple and say this with an absolute guarantee... Yes you can... Also congratulations on your weight loss success!
