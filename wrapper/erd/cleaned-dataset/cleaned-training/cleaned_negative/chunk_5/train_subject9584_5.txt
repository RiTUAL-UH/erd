 For people wondering if it's even harmful or not...the answer is basically yes, no and maybe. The vapor from e-cigs does contain either none or far less of the cancer causing carcinogens from traditional tobacco, but it does have higher levels of other toxins and toxic metals. What are the effects of inhaling 2nd hand vapor containing these increased volumes is the question. Science isn't totally sure yet, but they know it's not great. Here's one article of many with this content: http://www.foxnews.com/health/2014/08/29/study-second-hand-smoke-from-e-cigarettes-contains-toxic-metals/

 Yea, I agree. While the sentiment of slavery is always touchy, I think it's in how and why it's used. And I think that's why Keith Law mentions if you get offended by that stuff, maybe stay away from this game, but if you don't then you'll enjoy everything just fine.  




 Keith Law is a huge board game fan. He annually updates his [Top Board Games](http://meadowparty.com/blog/2014/11/18/top-60-boardgames/) on his personal blog. Pretty sure he did an AMA on /r/boardgames before too.

Edit: No AMA, but he commented on a [thread of his top 50 games of 2013](http://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1s9cgc/keith_laws_espn_baseball_writer_2013_list_of_his/) 









 Oh hey Snakes   Lattes employee! Do people really complain about the cover? I don't think it's unreasonable at all, especially since there's no time limit. A group of us from Buffalo come up, get there at opening on a Saturday and spend the entire day there. $5 to add gaming to my tab for all that? No complaints here. 




 Yep. Game gurus are great. Just wish they had more of them. We wanted to learn how to play Dead of Winter but the guru wouldn't teach us because it was on a list of games they aren't allowed to teach, only answer clarifying questions because of the time it takes to teach.  




 No kidding, really? I was there beginning of December, I didn't know they were adding a 2nd floor, I didn't see any construction. That's awesome.  




 I've been to Snakes   Lattes and their pub location Snakes   Lagers a bunch. Their set up, business plan and atmosphere is wonderful. And they are slammed. I live about 90 minutes from Toronto, so we usually try to make a day of it, show up first thing on a Saturday and game all day. By 2pm they're on a wait, and during peak evening hours it's probably a 2 hour wait. And the crowd is a very even mix of guys and girls. Gamers and social people. The social people are definitely the bread   butter, playing CAH, cranium and other party games. Their menu is limited, but it's good food. They do have a lot of games for sale (generally at full MSRP, but some were less). And I didn't really see anything for miniatures, but you could probably bring your own and play. They'll just charge you the regular $5 cover. We've brought a couple of our own games before.  




 Right. So your comment was doubly useless. If you fish for a man... 




 If you're going to comment on someone not having the courtesy to link to one of the previous discussions, at least have the courtesy to link to one of the previous discussions... 




 previously on /r/boardgames... 




 I meant on superbowl sunday 




 People let loose enough as it is. SuperBowl sunday is the 2nd biggest alcohol consumption day of the year in America behind 4th of July. Ever notice, outside of certain sports   SNL, there's really no good or big budget TV on Saturdays? People don't watch TV on Saturdays. Saturdays are people's 'going-out' day/night. Sundays are traditionally a more relaxed, stay-at-home-and-watch-tv day. There are always way more viewers on Sunday. If the NFL thought for a second they would get more viewers on Saturday, then they would but the Super Bowl on Saturday 




 check out /r/minipainting 




 I started following him and it's really almost always the normal pricing on Amazon or CSI or miniature market. It just looks like sales or deals because it's marked lower than MSRP 




 Ha, I've never seen so many bombs in a game. One round early in the game, our opponents each had a bomb in their hand 




 Maybe? I was high on adrenaline just recalling it. But it is a partner game of 2 v 2 




    *heavy breathing*  




 **The Battle of Tichu**

It was a bloodbath. Everything that could go wrong went wrong. Every hand loaded with 5's, 10's or Kings was bombed by our opponents. We tried to go "Grand Tichu" to hit a home run comeback. It blew up in our face. We were lost; scrambling like lost puppies in a rainstorm. We were being laughed off the table. The score was 385 to -110...but while the final battle seemed upon us, the end was not quite as close.


The tide began to turn with The Hand. Like Gandalf arriving at Helms Deep, sun parting the dark clouds of doom, it appeared in my hand to save the wretched day. Organized, the mahjong 1 card sat afar to the left...with sequential order the whole way through. A less daring Tichu has never been called. 3 tricks later, my opponent went out. Points rained upon us as our confidence boosted and our opponents began to doubt themselves for the first time. 


The next hand...fire in our eyes, we both went out before our opponents, knocking them into a stunned, scared state. Suddenly, every card played was doubted, every move questioned. They had lost their way. We could taste our moment on the horizon.


But our opponents momentarily recovered. They steadied themselves amidst the next two rounds, winning 50 and 40 points each, taking the total to 475 - 465. This would be the final battle. Possible glory for two, possible total embarrassment for our friends that would be endlessly mocked for blowing such a huge lead. 


My hand was dealt. I searched the cards for faces of Kings and Queens and Aces and Dragons. Nothing. Nothing but a lone Jack amidst a sea of small numbers. But upon closer look...a bomb of 3's. consecutive pairs of 66/77/88, three 9's and the Jack. As the beginning tricks of the round were dropped with singles, I passed. Sitting. Waiting for my moment. The perfect hand to bomb. It never came. A fair hand passed that my opponent would take, but it was bombed and lost. Our opponent was down to 4 cards. It was now or never, he played a pair of Q's. I bombed. And then readied myself for the final strike. 66/77/88. No one could match. Three 9's. No one could best them. And then I dropped the lone Jack, ridding all my cards first. The last out gave me their taken tricks and remaining cards. We counted the the final tally. It was victory for us. From the brink of defeat. From -110 points below our starting due to failed tichu's and thwarted hands, we rose and conquered our dear friends. And have laughed at them ever since.  









 Game store is different from cafe though. Game store needs people to come stay to entice them to buy their games on stock. Cafs have a very different business model and they're not selling those games on hand.  




 This is definitely the most common way. I haven't seen one that didn't, although there certainly may be. Snakes   Lattes in Toronto, perhaps the most famous board game cafe, has this model. Sit   stay as long as you want, play as many games as you want...it's $5 a person added to your bill for the gaming in addition to your food/drink.  




 **Wits   Wagers** is always fun! It's not too much pressure for knowing trivia since you get points by betting on whatever guess you want. I would definitely try to stick to vocally interactive games like many party games or CAH. Co-Op games like **Pandemic** would work nicely as well. **Pandemic The Cure** is a little lighter too if you can get it. 




 Ha, I literally just checked OLGS's and, for the first time, z-man's site and saw they had it there! $50 + shipping is real steep for an expansion. Hopefully this hits distributors or amazon prime soon. I can't wait. TM is my favorite game.  




 Games in this list that I can speak to...

**Firefly: The Game** is not good at all. It hits some nostalgic notes if you're a fan of the series, but if you take that out of the equation, the game falls very flat. I wouldn't go with this.

**Splendor** is such a good game. The mechanics are extremely simple (you either take tokens, buy a card or reserve a card), but you'll find a good amount of strategy, interesting decisions and replayability with it. And it's quick to play, and scales well for 2-4. 


**Lords of Vegas** is loads of fun. Has some good strategy to it as well, with lots of fun twists. This game is somewhat dependant on your group...for instance I have a couple guys in my group that always love to take the risky options in games for the hell of it, so that makes this game a blast every time. It's such a fun time.


And if you like co-op, **Robinson Crusoe** is an absolute masterpiece and a must-own for any big co-op fan. 




 Did those board game shelves become a mini wall separating the rooms? That's some serious dedication.  




 Good stuff. I have all my games organized vertically, so stuff is always going everywhere. Which model of the Really Useful Boxes did you use? 




 Jamie from The Secret Cabal Podcast just got this. [Their Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/thesecretcabal) has a bunch of recent posts   pictures of the game. I have no idea what gameplay is like, but the miniatures and board look unbelievable.  




 What about **Super Dungeon Explore**?

/u/r2d8 getinfo 




 Yes...once :)  




 I've never played Xia, but lots of games have first play scenario's and I always say get outta my face first play scenarios, i'm playing the real game.  




 Talk about box art that does not match the game at all. Those are some colorful tiles, pieces and cards. Wasn't expecting that. How is this game? Sitting at pretty solid 7.5/10 on bgg 




 That could be true. I also think there's a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy with established high ranked games. People pick them up because the see the rating and want to like it too because they think they're supposed to. Obviously they're all tremendous games, but there could be a bit of that too. I know I can give high ranked games more of a chance after a bad play because I know they're supposed to be very good.  




 Can't get it to play at work. Can anyone provide the run down? 




 Thanks! Also, how necessary are airbrushes? I've watched a few tutorials, they almost all use airbrushes, but it's out of my price range for starting out.  




 If you screw up painting a mini, is it pretty easy to "start over?" Give it a new primer coating and start over?  




 Why are you saying it that way?

*Saying whhat whhat whay?* 




 I'm not looking to become a master, just get some pizazz into mini's I have in some table top board games. I've looked into some starter kits, and I'm ready to pull the trigger, I just don't want to waste my time if it's something you really need some skill for. 




 Absolutely spot on. Great advice 




 When was who started being sarcastic first a question? I was. I'm usually sarcastic. You're just a downer. As I said before...lighten up 




 Welcome to the Internet where talking to friends about your interests is desperate lol. Good grief, dude. Lighten up.  




 You must be fun at parties. I'm well aware I didn't describe my intrinsic motivation for why I want to tell people about board games.  




 You know what I meant. I'm not being exclusive about the games. It was just for brevity in the title.  




 Great idea. This just usually comes up at parties when the conversation turns to hobbies or something. Can't exactly whip out Bruges from my back pocket. But the keep it short and sweet to theme and general mechanics is a good idea. It gets more difficult when I get the question "well what's your favorite game?" And I have to explain Terra Mystica..."well it's an economy and area control game where everyone place a mythical race, trying to terraform land and build buildings..." and then I lose them haha 




 Well he was just someone that rushed to 'oh D D' and clearly then had no interest in what I was saying. But other people, in general, have literally no concept of these games and just don't understand, keep asking for examples of games (that they'll never know about). I was just wondering what people do to explain the games to those people, short of making them watch a video or bust out a game for them. 




 There are lots of business planning and budgeting tools on the internet for start ups, especially cafes. All you'd have to do is take a look at those and then add however much you want to spend on stocking games   shelves.  




 I was trying to explain Dead of Winter to a co-worker and within 15 seconds he says "sounds like Dungeons   Dragons." People seem to always ask 'are these games like monopoly? risk? clue? or go off the other side and think it's D D. I usually end up just saying they have lots of strategy and victory points and they shrug, still not getting it.  




 Sure! Like anything, if people can easily find you and if you provide a unique insight while being entertaining, people will follow you. I think the most important part (outside of being able to be easily found) is to provide your own unique perspective. I watch a lot of video reviewers like SU SD, Watch It Played, Rahdo and Dice Tower and they all offer their own experience and angles. Be unique. Find your own angle that works for you, reflects who you are and is genuine. If it's good, people will stay. 


edit: and to some of your questions - for me, nothing makes me fall asleep quicker in a blog than extensive rule run summaries. If I wanted in depth rules, I'd read the manual. I'd say if you're doing a full review, maybe stick to a brief overview of the theme, object and basic gameplay mechanics. 




 What about [**Amerigo**](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/137408/amerigo) or [**Lewis   Clark**](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/140620/lewis-clark)? Honestly, I haven't played either, but they're based around discovery   expansion (I think) 




 Well, I guess it's sci-fi but **Eclipse** pretty much starts with nothing but a few center hexes and you explore off those. And it's an awesome game.  




 Yea, I'm pretty sure we played the game half a dozen times before realizing that.  




 As long as they are connected via Carpet Ride ability (same for Dwarves with tunnelling), it counts for end game scoring of connected settlements. It does not count for creating a town. 

It's like how indirect connection counts for end-game scoring, but not for creating a Town.  




 Oh wow...the game itself isn't similar at all to Terra Mystica. In TM you have direct   indirect interaction where you're cutting people off for land and building adjacent with money/power/vp exchanges. TM isn't the most interactive game, but it definitely has interaction, especially with 4-5 people, and 3 as well to a lesser extent. Castles of Mad King Ludwig has none of that. Each player has his own play area where you're building your castle. And unlike Suburbia where you can get bonuses based on what other's have built, in Castles you only get bonuses/penalties for what's in your Castle. The main interaction in Castles comes from the auction block. The "Master Builder" (which rotates like a 1st player marker) gets to take the 5/6/7 room tiles and arrange them in any order he wants on the auction block (ranging from $2k, $4k, $6k etc). So if you see people really need a certain room type, you may want to make it more expensive so they have to pay (and pay you, the master builder), but maybe not too expensive so no one buys it. So there's some interesting decisions to make on how you organize the auction block, trying to predict what people need and what they will or can buy.  




 numbers are also language independent

Edit: I'm wrong. Please ignore my comment and feel free to mock my wrongness.  




 You can also combine Cyclades and Kemet with an expansion, correct?  




 If you have access to a workshop, maybe you could cut the meeple (or something boardgame related) out of wood, stain/paint it and mount it on a trophy platform.  




 I haven't played Cyclades but Kemet and Eclipse are both owned by my group and hit the table regularly. **Eclipse** is one of my all time favorite games. I love the scope of the game, the economy management and the various legitimate paths to victory. It always feels like an epic game. On **Kemet**, I'm just not a huge fan. I really want to like this game and I get why people do, but it just hasn't clicked for me. Every game I play it feels like everyone is just ramping their stuff up and, bam, the game is over all of a sudden.  









 Oh man, I can't wait. That's the one I'm most excited for. Castles was just easier to get to the table. We've had Suburbia for awhile so it didn't take long at all to learn the rules. I just haven't had time to go through the Brass book and/or watch some walkthrough videos. I can't wait to play it though.  




 I think any time a game has custom pieces at all it's awesome. Custom D6? Sweet. Custom meeples? Awesome. Custom non-plastic money? Fantastic. It just shows an attention to care and quality in the game. The main reasoning for wanting Xia: Legends of a Drift System is because of all the custom miniature ships, metal coins and dice.  




 Agree with all this. The one thing I'd say about Trajan is that there are a ton of things you *can* worry about, but you're always best to stick to one strategy as much as possible. I think in a 2P game, construction is the dominant strategy. Then shipping overall. I haven't found a way to go all-in on Military as much as possible and win though.  




 I very much dislike Catan. Our group just played it death years ago. Once in a blue moon someone will suggest we play Catan and it gets to the table. If it does, I always put in Cities   Knights to add some depth to it. And without fail, about halfway through the game I think "why the hell did I suggest this? this will never end." Every damn time. I'll never learn.  




 The one thing I'll say about Feld games is they all scale very well. **Trajan** is a brilliant game, and I love playing it 2P. **Bruges** is a masterpiece, best with 3-4, but still very very enjoyable with 2. **Bora Bora** also goes well with 2P, albeit it probably shines more with 3-4 due to the meanness of blocking actions.  




 Yea, I've heard it balances it out. I'll have to tell my friend to pick it up.  




 Yea, I'm not sure if this one has a feature mechanic like the Trajan mancala wheel, or how dice are used in CoB or Bora Bora. I watched Rahdo's run through and he mentioned that as well, but still really liked it and talked about some of the unique things the game does as a whole.


And it does look really nice. 




 I got a brand new shipment of **Brass**, **Castles of Mad King Ludwig**, and **1775: Rebellion** in from Amazon, but was able to only play CoMKL of that group. I really like this game. We have Suburbia in our group as well, and our group does tend to lean on heavier games, but Suburbia just always felt fiddly to me...easy to mess up with erring on adjusting scores across red lines and missing a tile on someone's board. Castles really streamlines all that and the theme is much more fun. We laughed at each other's castles and made ridiculous kingly declarations as we built. Loved it. 


Also got my all-time favorite game in, **Terra Mystica.** 4 players, I finished a distant second as the Dwarves, with the Fakirs cruising to victory. Fakirs used their Carpet Ride ability to grab the 18 point bonus at the end for biggest land mass, and they had 3 of the 4 cult tracks. Tons of end game scoring for them, very well played. This game is just so good with 4 people. I love it.


Had some lighter fare as well. Busted out a couple games of **Splendor.** I really enjoy this with 2P. I think it highlights the 'reserving a card' as you can use it a bit more defensively if you see someone grabbing coins obviously for a card that fits it. Very simple game with great replay-ability and solid depth.

I played **Machi Koro** for the first time. It was...meh? It didn't really grab me. I got a few cafes and the building stealing card and cruised. I'll play it again if people want but wouldn't recommend it.

And finally, in the Dice Chucker theme, this fits right in...I got a co-op game of my favorite dice chucker game...**Fortune   Glory!** This game is stupid fun. Traveling around, rolling dice, killin nazi's, finding treasure. It's awesome if you don't take it seriously and just have a good time with it. I've always leaned towards heavier euros, and cared more about mechanics than theme, but this game just grabbed me from the start with its Indiana Jones nostalgia, miniatures, funky artwork, I dig it.  




 That is a fantastic collection. Very similar tastes to mine...lots of games I have and even more that I want! 

How is **Aquasphere**? I'm a big Feld fan so I can't wait to pick it up. I've heard it's very brain-burnery.  




 There is basically no theme. I guess you're building a castle manor with some animals and knowledge and ships and buildings? I've played this game hundreds of times (often online at boiteajeux.net) and I freaking love it. It's in my top 10 of all time for sure. It scales wonderfully from 2-4 people. It's simple mechanics, a fair bit of depth   strategy and lots of replayability with the different mats and randomization of when the tiles come out. It is a superb game. As everyone here will say, how the dice are used is really neat. It's a bit of luck sometimes what you roll, but with the workers and some knowledge tiles you can mitigate that and keep your long term strategy. It's fantastic.  




 Yea man, definitely not a slur. Dice Tower has some video reviews talking about the best ameritrash games of all time. And other podcasts similarly so as well 




 I just got Castles of Mad King Ludwig today! I'm unboxing it now. I'm really looking forward to it. I liked Suburbia but it was always a bit fiddly for me, checking other people's boards, making sure you're adjusting your income/population for every red line you cross. I like the theme much more in Castles, and I think it's streamlined some of that fiddliness.  




 Haha I'll give you that  




 I don't think it's insulting to call things ameritrash. Maybe for some people it is, I guess. That's just the name that got dumped on it really. I love me some ameritrash. Fortune   Glory is one of my all time favorites. I lean to euros usually, but sometimes it's just great to have go nuts in ameritrash  




 That's what's up /u/Starving_Fartist. I thought you were super new to games based on what your said about your collection, so I was just making a very simplified statement about the genres of games.  




 No, you're right. I'm the one getting angry and defensive lol. Have a good day on the internet! 




 Forgot to ask...you have both Suburbia and Castles of Mad King Ludwig...which do you like best? 




 That's a corgi, not a doge. 




 Yes, Mr. Thesaurus, I was making generalizations about the genres. I never said that ameritrash games couldn't have strategy. Those are what the genres are. Ameritrash - heavy on theme/experiences/randomness - Euros heavy on mechanics/strategy. Are there exceptions? Of course there are. Like anything in the world.  




 As you get deeper into board games, especially once you delve into medium to heavy weight euros, you'll see the thematic elements wane and strategy/mechanic elements increase. Some people love that. Some people look for board games to be more of a thematic elements aka "ameritrash" games. You may just prefer those types of games right now; lots of randomness, look, story telling, immersion and theme.

Try games like **Fortune   Glory**, **Betrayal at House on the Hill**, **Zombicide**, **Last Night On Earth**, **Nexus Ups** and many more. Those are all very heavy thematic and games with more of an immersion into the experience and theme.  




 [Hotels booked through GenCon](http://gencon.com/attend/hotelmap) 




 Actual question...have you ever travelled? Those are pretty much always the most expensive parts of any trip. How you spend money on daily activities/food/souvenirs is totally up to you.  




 Great collection! We have near identical tastes in games, my collection looks a lot like that, and ones you have that I don't are all on my wishlist. What's your favorite game there? Any regrets? 




 I think that's the opposite of the question... 




 For me, it would be **Eclipse.** You see a thousand ships, tiles for tech   science and resource cubes abound, but really when it comes down to it, all you're doing is choosing one of a few actions each turn til you can't do it anymore. Explore, research, attack etc. The mechanics are pretty straight forward once you know what you're doing.  




 The autosave files continually get corrupted and screw the game up every time. I can't find anywhere in the game to disable it 




 So we're just making fun of little people now? Calling them dwarves and laughing because they're on a spyder? How the fuck is that funny? 




 Maybe you should be on your conference call instead of posting to reddit.  




 Great explanation. Thanks a lot! 




 Yea, reading/watching some stuff on Xia just now is where I saw that term. Hadn't heard it before.  









 Some good work put in by /r/boardgames the last two days. I think we killed B N's and ThinkGeek's stock pretty quickly in back to back days 









 haha deal...Eminent Domain, Dead of Winter, Race for the Galaxy, Mice   Mystics, Suburbia, Manhattan Project, Power Grid and Sentinels of the Multiverse are yours :)  




 Wow, I've never really taken a look at all the components. Those are gorgeous! They come pre-painted like that? I'd say worth it. Crap, now I want to spend $85. Damn you.  




 ooo where did you get Xia? It's crazy expensive on Amazon right now. Did you just take the plunge or find a deal somewhere? 




 Great collection! Feel free to send me 1-80 games! 




 [Hmmm](http://i.imgur.com/cI8IHaS.png) 




 Haha nice! I love how we can rationalize game purchases. I've picked up Brass, Castles of Mad King Ludwig   1775: Rebellion in a CSI purchase and now Dead of Winter. All in the past week. I'll have so much unboxing to do, I'm so excited haha. 




 Yea it's not good! This was purchase #4 for me already haha.

 When you say "find a Kingdom," what does 'Kingdom' refer to? A strategy for your deck? 




 If you're leaving the board set, playing asynchronously, **Castles of Burgundy** might not be bad if you have the room. It plays great with 2 people, and it's not bad to play asynchronously as you can always see everything on the board. Just takes a second to remind yourself what your strategy is at.   




 A lot of the games deal with history, but producers Academy Games and GMT Games really focus on educational aspects for their publications. Not sure how many are geared towards younger audiences though.  




 So, 52 games a year?! 




 That doge on the left is definitely familiar with the cheese drawer. 




 I own both **Jamaica** and **Formula D.** Jamaica is definitely not my favorite game. It's super light with very little strategy or skill. Lots of luck. But it's fun with the right group and good gateway or filler game after a brain-burner. 

I really like Formula D. Again, there is a good amount of luck, but there is some strategy and push your luck mechanics that make it more exciting. It's a lot of fun to see your friends try to push for the perfect roll and blow their car up.  




 Can I have it? 




 how about The Duke? It's chess-like, with a few twists...mainly flipping the tiles after you move them to give a new move pattern for that tile. And a turn option to grab a tile from your tile bag to place on the board. It's a lot of fun. One of my favorite 2 player games. 




 Nice. Is it still fun for the person who is the mastermind? 




 When you say mastermind...that's one of the players as well, right? Not just the mechanics of the game itself? 




 The art turned me off right away. I'm just not into anime at all. But I recently listened to a Secret Cabal podcast where they talked about it and, to their surprise, loved it. What are your thoughts on Tragedy Looper if you've played it? 




 Pretty sure I said my question was answered. Generally Amazon doesn't have identical things fulfilled by Prime with very different prices. So, yes, I'm quite familiar.  




 I hear ya. I hope I didn't come across as cynical, I was genuinely curious in the process!  




 Good luck with everything!

Question for you: how do you think something like this will do on indiegogo/kickstarter. The traditional product on this is something that the consumer can get or receive (i.e. a boardgame, toy, music, electronic etc), but as a brick   mortar store, only someone in your area could physically benefit from this. Why, besides out of sheer generosity, would someone outside your area be compelled to support this? Or are you simply expecting the support and funds to come directly from the Beverly area? 




 http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/63740/hotel-samoa 




 Hotel Samoa? Hotel Tycoon? Maybe [Hotel Life](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/4485/hotel-life)? 




 Ah, perfect. That was exactly what I was looking for. Thanks! 




 Ah, ok...so is there any actual difference in the games? Or just how amazon priced the 1st edition Artipia and the second edition that stronghold came on board with? 




 Well they're both amazon prime and both say 'by Stronghold Games' beneath the title. That's why I was confused. 




 [Here was my search result for it](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Dtoys-and-games field-keywords=among%20the%20stars sprefix=among+the+%2Ctoys-and-games)


On the top row, I understand the middle is the expansion, but why is one Among The Stars listed as $29, and the other at $41? Just weird product coding by Amazon? There's no difference with the one that says Card Game, right? 

**edit:** thanks for the responses, answered my questions! 




 [**Ghost Stories**](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/37046/ghost-stories) seems like a pretty good thematic match
