 My reply:

 That is quite a quandary. Opportunity breeding decisions. You can save local businesses by reserving eggs for them or you can use the money to invest in people who follow your model (I know you aren't interested in personally expanding). Either of those takes people coming to you and being honest with their finances and goals - and you have to be sure of their honesty and integrity. I think you will be able to do both by riding the wave for people and places which do not come to you for help (or do not warrant it), but letting some partake reduced prices. The only sour point there is those who see a double standard or are turned away not be humble enough to understand. If that seems insurmountable, take the money and invest it in more farms.

 [The article](http://theind.com/article-20971-You-Get-What-You-Pave-For.html) says taxpayers can expect to pay much more in taxes each year, or the city has to find another solution.

 I haven't seen Tomorrowland, yet, but I can wonder why there are no bathroom cleaners. Automation relieved society of the need for that particular menial task.

Automation currently removes the demand for jobs like airline receptionists and secretaries, people who just punch tickets and register information. A user interface and networked customer information system automated 95% of the job, so we can do the last 5% by typing in some info and swiping our card. There is still demand because a human touch is still more agile than a human's code.

It isn't like people are pre-destined to be low-skilled workers (not that I think anyone thinks that, anymore). Automation can also make it easier to live independently for people who might fall into those tasks today and the many that did, previously. People both fall into those tasks and life is not made easier through automation for various reasons which we may not entirely disagree on.

Did the movie preclude that in some way? Were there renegade air conditioning specialists?

 Do you mean this definition?

 a system of cultivation intended to maintain permanent agriculture or horticulture by relying on renewable resources and a self-sustaining ecosystem.

 




 Fair enough, but that is as hippy-dippy as it gets.

People who engage with this design ethic have increased quality and profits at the same time. Joel Salatin has a well-known example of an extremely successful operation. Mark Shepard documented how he was raking in cash while his plow and corporate seed monoculture neighbors were suffering. There is a good example of an orchard which bucked the norm and did a few things: stopped spraying, diversified cultivars, and increased biodiversity in the orchard; this orchard was a hobby until he did this and it turned a profit. This isn't some get rich quick thing, these are prominent examples which took years to figure out the pieces and fit them together correctly. I can link you to short youtube videos which pertain to each of the mentioned people.

 I was watching and I noticed that they haven't stopped consuming, they just compact the inert waste.

The sustainability some people desire (like Paul Wheaton of Wheaton Labs) is to make the supply train as responsible as possible. This prevents permanent contaminants even coming onto the property. He's practical, but he has a goal to not even have synthetic paints and gasoline vehicles at the first circle of habitation. 




 Certainly are an interesting bunch. Ted has spent an awful lot of time thinking, that is evident. 




 Agriculture has the etymology agri+culture. Agri meaning sky (as in, open fields); culture meaning exactly what we think. Since this is a movement which has found plowing (widely considered a sign of civilization) as detrimental to perpetual habitation, the founders thought a direct challenge and contrast was fitting. Hence perma was substituted for agri. Perma meaning just what you'd expect. All they mean is that this is a design ethic which is meant to find the best way to create a permanent, non-cyclic and non-self-destructive, way of enabling human settlement and life. 




  I think the author refers to the people that founded the movement by name; he mentions Bill Mollison. If you read the article again, you'll see the most astute permaculturists insist that the market is a part of life.

Permaculture is just like applying the ideas of human action to each part of an endeavor. "What behaviors, inputs, and outputs does a chicken have?" Then you give it what it needs and use its behaviors and outputs to their best use. Chickens are omnivores and scratch the dirt, so many systems elect to run cows over pasture and follow with chickens. The chickens eat flies for protein and spread the manure. They also eat different greens that grow in the meadow.

Permaculture is a design system, not a lifestyle or save the planet cult.

 So he is saying that the government collecting money is not violence, but that money will go to private hands instead of somehow the government doing everything internally down to mining the raw ore and farming is violence. 




 Permaculture, Strong Towns, and American Libertarianism are three of my interests which are intersecting in this article.

From what I know of permaculturists, many are mostly anti-political rather than anti-liberty. 









 I agree.

Permaculture, Strong Towns/ Lean Urbanism/ New Urbanism, and American Libertarianism are three of my interests which are intersecting in this article.

The idea of a responsible supply chain is very interesting. It recognizes externalities of various kinds, empowering journalists and academics to monitor the modern goods and services and supports paying the costs up front which would otherwise be deferred to pollution or human strife.

Come to think of it, /r/keto also intersects, here, because if Allan Savory and Dr. Peter Attia are both right there is a very obvious solution. 




 Woohoo! More Shriners in tiny cars! 




 The secret is, we ruined all our beaches a hundred years ago. 




 You know what I like about a parade? Hearing the drums of the band getting closer and closer. The brass and cymbals coming into range and slowly getting more clear. The sound of a band coming changes if you are in a small town, or near a park or pond, or nestled in the canyon of a city center's skyscrapers. The echo and reverberation can confuse the distance. Then the band comes around the corner and you hear the real power of a marching band.

I enjoy the sight and smell of old cars, hot rods, firetrucks, and military surplus rolling down the street. I enjoy seeing the community and trade groups because they show the vibrancy of a town. I enjoy seeing the Shriners race miniature cars to delight children. I'm not a fan of having children ride floats in parades - it isn't where the children want.

You know what I didn't like about a parade, once? I walked in front of the Macy's Day Parade one year and being in NYC before and after the parade was the worst part, everything else was ok. The Macy's freight elevator was filthy (if you haven't been in the belly of an American city, you don't know what I mean) and we were accosted by the unfortunate mentally handicapped who are homeless on the streets.

A parade is a hopeful thing when done right, but it is easy to do wrong. I don't like watching the Macy's Day Parade because it is done wrong. It isn't personable and it isn't for the person on the street. You can't televise a parade - not the real parades. How long can a parade really be?

People don't like parades because some parades are done wrong. Keep it short. One band in front, one near the back. Have marshals to keep the pace; don't rely on stopping and starting. Only kids who are directly involved should be in the parade; no idle wavers, even in float contests. Idle wavers subtract from the audience. The last piece in a parade should always be obvious, and possibly traditional. Cities still have to keep it short and should consider neighborhood or district parades.

 Successful people do not work in jobs where they cannot perform everyone else's job, too.

Don't work in customer service unless you are fine with no internal advancement.

 One previous post which was about the rash ended with OP discovering a macadamia nut allergy. Keto rash looks exactly like when I eat coconut protein (I have to use refined coconut oil - which is a shame because I love the taste!).

Red and slightly puffy, itchy but forgettable, and lasts for weeks. Seems to appear above the diaphram and below or between the pectoral muscles/ adipose deposits. All in all not fun, but I can't say that is what you are experienceing for sure and I have not found a way to end the reaction faster. I also have no idea what a protein allergy can do to your kidneys, if anything.

I can tell you that I survive instances without cortisol because if there is one thing I hate more than an itch it is a smelly, sticky undershirt.

Check your recent diet for new types of dietary proteins you may have eaten. 




 It wouldn't be impossible to turn that into a nice place to live.

 I would rather have my pay up front than promised. That is the trade-off.

 Well, it might help bad management if they hired someone who would fix the internal issues instead of begging for more cash to throw away.

Cool. Sorry, I thought since you were making the same argument I was you were making another argument. But mine wasn't terribly clear.

 Much complaint over what seems to be a fluid situation, with even the Conservative party agreeing on some faults though not the overall idea of privatization. If one considers the action of privatization a government action (this one certainly was) it can be said the same level of success has been seen as is normally achieved in any other government program. 




   This is the case across the globe.

Only because if any private company pops up it either has to attach itself to government money, serve a segment not able to get government support, or die.

How can anyone compete with endless money, and why would you improve once you get that money? 




 I can imagine how we have no idea how great security services could be if the sector didn't have to compete with the endless pockets of government. 




 The take-away from that should be that those companies don't need subsidies. You should look and see who owns the roads, too (government). So let's say almost all methods of major transport accept government money.

Why are we doing that? There are myriad reasons we are in this state, but the effect is to make travel less expensive for the less wealthy because taxes are progressive, right?

Two things to say to that: some people think the tax structure isn't progressive enough and these companies have made their services more expensive because once you get into the pen the trough of government money overfloes.

Cut off the money. 




 And? If the government is going to do that, then it doesn't deserve to have control of the assets. That is how I treat all government powers. 




 I might call that a failure.

We gonna start evading the Amtrak issue now that I brought up the post office? 




   it is clear that privatization leads to slack rather than efficiency.

 




  The post office is rather well run.

Sometimes it doesn't matter how well run something is if it fills the demand poorly and I hesitate to call it well run at the deficits it carries yeat-to-year.

 People wonder what is eating America out from the inside? Infrastructure costs being unresolved by local taxes. Developers not building mixed, truly walkable, communities. Government not giving up on owning something when it fails (post office, Amtrak, etc.).

Amtrak was a corporate bailout from the start. We don't want bailouts, right? So it was a bad decision to begin with!

Now we've got this company that America treats like a toy train set. Grow up.

ninjaedit: I'm not saying "grow up" to /u/crackron 




 Giving Amtrack more money doesn't solve passenger trains using the same tracks as cargo, road-level crossings, corruption and overpaid workers, or bad management.

Well, it might help bad management if they hired someone who would fix the internal issues instead of begging for more cash to throw away.

 The [wiki page for Dust Bowl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_Bowl) supports this view. I think one of the more accessible (and short) works which gives more detail is [*Dirt: Erosion of Civilizations*](http://smile.amazon.com/Dirt-Civilizations-David-R-Montgomery-ebook/dp/B007V2D4JO) by David R. Montgomery.

If there had been record rains instead of record drought, the dirt would have washed away. Just like Boston received red snow, the floods would have been red with soil. Montgomery has good information on how early American farming practices caused massive gullies in the Carolinas and northern Georgia around the time of the Civil War. Thankfully, the seed drill and cover cropping has resolved the most extreme negative effects of agriculture on soil. - it is still odd to think that the plow has probably killed more people than the sword through instgating droughts, floods, and famines.

Montgomery has a few lectures on youtube. In at least one, [he includes material left out of the printed book because it was too data-centric for the intended audience.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQACN-XiqHU)

The difference is how change is brought on. NU used political structures and developer relationships to modify sections of the built environment (or build them from scratch, more often); LU tries to fix existing areas (not precluding redevelopment) by relaxing and eliminating regulatory and zoning ordinances. There isn't supposed to be a difference in community involvement, but instead of the process in NU being driven by the town or city, in LU it is driven by developers big and small. the idea is to set up a system of [guidelines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jl0hMfqNQ-g) which everyone can use to build a cohesive and healthy town or city rather than the NU way of master-planning everything. The small business owner isn't squished quite as much this way and the process becomes an opportunity for good design and planning principles to take over in a town or city, rather than political squabbling and cronyism.
