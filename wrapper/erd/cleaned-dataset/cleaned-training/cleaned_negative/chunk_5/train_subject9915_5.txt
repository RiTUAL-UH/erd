 If you're looking for specific literature I'd recommend Lucifer Rising by COS Reverend Gavin Baddeley.

Peter Gilmore writes about how music influences him in the Satanic Scriptures. He comes from a orchestral music background, so he lists those composers and pieces that inspire him. If you're interested in hearing his own work he made much of it available for free here: http://www.churchofsatan.com/music-peter-h-gilmore.php 




 Was LaVey the perfect father? Probably not. So what? Read the article. Her grievances can be summed as "daddy didn't give me enough attention. He was such a selfish asshole" Funny how she was perfectly happy with her family situation *exactly* up to the point where father told her "no, you and your nutty boyfriend aren't getting the Church of Satan." She then ran off and joined up with Aquino, obviously looking for another father figure. When Aquino told her "no, you're not getting the Temple of Set" she ran off again and found Buddha. 




 Satanism is also inherently anti-egalitarian, advocates hierarchy, private property, and yes, the rule of law. "Thats why I believe in stratification by allowing water to seek its own level. Its something that can, and is, being done. Im all for a police state; no messing around. There should be an armed guard on every street corner. The Israelis have the right idea: school bus drivers and MacDonalds managers carrying Uzis." Like I said, you're going to have a lot of caveats.    




 "At the time of his death LaVey was embroiled in a number of personal controversies. He had also acquired a number of competitors who wanted to discredit him.  This meant that a cottage industry arose in material which painted LaVey in the worst possible light.  Accordingly, people close to Anton LaVey tend to be instinctively wary when questioned: people who hated him are only too happy to share their grievances.

I have no desire to write a salacious tell-all, especially since LaVey's life doesn't appear to have been all that salacious.  (He's certainly got nothing on transvestite meth-head priests).  I won't hide unflattering information if it is important to his work, if it sheds light on his philosophy or influence. But I'm primarily concerned with his failings insofar as they shed light on his accomplishments.  Tragic flaws interest me: petty ones not so much.

 You say you're looking for unbiased look at the Church of Satan but you've been seemingly disturbed by the claims of extremely biased individuals. The people that spread that whole "pimping" claim were people who were trying to discredit LaVey after his death so that they could lay claim to the COS and his royalties. As for the whole "cannibalism" thing, so what? There was the old prank that LaVey would pull on house guests, where he would serve "long pig" (thigh of woman). This was obviously a joke, even LaVey/COS detractor Aquino claims it was a joke. Whatever his own personal experiences are, that's just it, his own personal experiences. As /u/JasonUncensored properly stated, LaVey is no hero, never claimed to be, and told people *not* to worship him. "Satanism demands study, not worship!"  

Writer Kenaz Filan is currently working on an unbiased biography of LaVey and the early Church of Satan. You can follow his work at his blog here: http://kenazfilan.blogspot.com/search/label/satanism  

 




 As a Satanist I'm a pure materialist and shun the spiritual all together. So from a theological stand point I have very little interest in Gnosticism. That said, I do find value in Gnostic art and symbolism and feel comfortable using it for purely emotional and aesthetic purposes. 




 In theory, yes. But that does not mean many Satanists would agree with your political views, you're more likely to run into people who are at the opposite end of the political spectrum. Any political ideology that leans heavy on collectivism would have hard time synergizing with Satanism's extreme individualist philosophy. I know several Satanists who hold Egoist Anarchist ideals (myself included), but wouldn't be fond of any of Social Anarchism's collectivist theories. LaVey was very open about saying that [Satanism **is** Americanism](http://news.churchofsatan.com/post/26500106054/a-horned-salute-on-independence-day). Does that mean you need to fall in line and agree? Not necessarily, but don't be surprised if you find yourself in constant conflict. That said, there are plenty of Satanists who go their way independently, applying the philosophy as they see fit.

 A clip of my interview with the producer starts at the 00:03:05 mark. 









 The Church of Satan was the first above-ground religious organization to fully and officially support and perform homosexual marriage. Magus Gilmore has continued this tradition and has been an outspoken critic of recent attempts by religious fundamentalists to ban same-sex marriage.

 Not sure where they got their sources for their ideas on the Church of Satan because they got a lot of that wrong. The Church of Satan does not merely believe Satanism is a philosophy, but absolutely takes the position that Satanism is a religion. The point is repeated multiple times in The Satanic Bible, in the online literature, and in our media representation.  
























 That sounds reasonable. I knew a few people who would call "extended mind" phenomenon and the like "supernormal".  




 What? No they aren't. Rejection of afterlife, of heaven and hell, of a supernatural God and his kingdom. A rejection of any life after this one. Death as the great abstinence, the finality of conscious existence. There's no ambiguity about it. 




 The Satanist is pragmatic, motivated by rational self-interest. There are plenty of ways of emotionally, psychologically, and symbolically destroying a person who violates your space without resorting to unnecessary physical violence. Then again, sometimes you have to stand your ground, but be prepared to be responsible for the consequences. 




   if to be a Satanist *merely* means to emulate the meaning of the word Satan  

No. That's part of it, but the rejection of the spiritual and ethereal is just as important, as well at the several other factors. Gnostic Christians are just that, Gnostic Christians.

 Peddle your shit elsewhere, you're embarrassing yourself. 




 Lesser magic: Yes. Greater magic: Maybe.   

At its core, Greater Magic is theatrical and psychological drama. The purpose is to exercise your emotions and to let go of the psychological detritus that might be holding you back from enjoying your life or achieving your goals.  

That said, there is room in the Satanic religion for the possibility that there may be some external influence that is a byproduct of Greater Magic. There are some Satanists who are interested in experimenting with that possibility, using rituals to exert their influence on others so to nudge events in their favor. Those Satanists may be interested in the works of the biologist Rupert Sheldrake, who describes such events as the "extended mind".  

The Church of Satan does not require Satanists to "have faith" in this. If you are not interested or are skeptical of such phenomenon, that's fine. From the FAQ (http://churchofsatan.com/faq-ritual-and-ceremony.php):  
We emphasize that the philosophy of the Church of Satan does not require that our members believe that ritual is more than an emotional experience, nor is there a mandate even to ritualize at all. We simply offer it as a tool for experimentation. Some folks have found results that they feel are beyond coincidence or statistical parameters. Others simply enjoy the release of emotions otherwise hindering their pursuit of personal happiness.  

There is no judgment placed on members of the Church of Satan regarding their personal understanding of how ritual functions. One is not more or less of a Satanist based upon his or her evaluation of Greater Magic. See the essay, On the Role of Ritual in the Life of a Satanist by our High Priestess, Magistra Peggy Nadramia, for more information.  









 [Church of Satan - IN MEMORIAM H.R. GIGER (1940-2014 c.e.)](http://news.churchofsatan.com/post/85645835142/in-memoriam-h-r-giger-1940-2014-c-e) 




 Exactly, the Black Mass *is* a hateful, defamatory ritual. Hence the Catholics are in the right for opposing it and using their power to shut it down. That's why Black Masses are private rituals, used for private purposes, and if they're to be public then you better own up to the fact that you are the Bad Guys. It seems the Satanic Temple wants to have both ways, to use Satan's name for publicity, but hide behind victim-hood and cries of persecution when challenged, and use that victim mentality to get on their soapbox and proclaim themselves as the Good Guys. Go back the warm bosom of Wicca and underbelly of Buddha if that's your cup of tea. 




 Comments like this make me skeptical of your claims that this was an "authentic" ritual based on LaVey...   

"And this we can and will do by violating the quietude of thy body, profaner of the ample vices, abstractor of stupid purities, cursed Nazarene, impotent king, fugitive god!  

Behold, great Satan, this symbol of the flesh of him who would purge the Earth of pleasure and who, in the name of Christian "justice" has caused the death of millions of our honored Brothers.  **We curse him and defile his name.**  

O Infernal Majesty, condemn him to the Pit, evermore to suffer in perpetual anguish. Bring Thy wrath upon him, O Prince of Darkness, and
rend him that he may know the extent of Thy anger. Call forth Thy legions that they may witness what we do in Thy name. Send forth thy messengers to proclaim this deed, and **send the Christian
minions staggering to their doom. Smite him anew, O Lord of Light, that his angels, cherubim, and seraphim may cower and tremble with fear,
prostrating themselves before Thee in respect of Thy power. Send crashing down the gates of Heaven, that the murders of our ancestors
may be avenged!** 




 There are plenty of public accounts, [including photos](http://imgur.com/HBNEwLe), which attribute to my embarrassing conclusion. Edit: The Germans have a word for this: Fremdscham. 









 A polite, unoffensive Black Mass is pretty far from authentic.  




 I'll just reiterate this from a prior comment: With all their whitewashing of the ritual they should have called it the White Mass. The Black Mass is designed to be a psychological and symbolic attack, both at the senses of the participants and at the institutions themselves. The whole point is to rile up the senses, emotions, and to intentionally invoke a psychological break from the target subject.  




 With all their whitewashing of the ritual they should have called it the White Mass. The Black Mass is designed to be a psychological and symbolic attack, both at the senses of the participants and at the institutions themselves. 

Also, the event was not private, it was public event that had fliers around the campus. Reservations were required but it was for all intents and purposes a promotional event. 

Apparently their little Chinese restaurant retreat was an embarrassing crying victim circle jerk, surrounded by amused lounge employees.  




 I can't help but agree with /u/Paradoxinteractions. Le Messe Noir is openly a mockery and symbolic attack at Catholicism.   

"This ritual is a psychodrama in the truest sense. Its prime purpose is to reduce or negate stigma acquired through past indoctrination. It is also a vehicle for retaliation against unjust acts perpetrated in the name of Christianity." - The Satanic Rituals  

LaVey also advised the Church of Satan to take the idea of the Black Mass and apply it to institutions other than Christianity:  
"A black mass, today, would consist of the blaspheming of such "sacred" topics as Eastern mysticism, psychiatry, the psychedelic movement, ultra-liberalism, etc. Patriotism would be championed, drugs and their gurus would be defiled, acultural militants would be deified, and the decadence of ecclesiastical theologies might even be given a Satanic boost." - The Satanic Bible   

So when I heard first of these people doing a Black Mass I thought it was strange, considering that the express purpose of the Satanic Temple is to spread love and compassion.  

Reports from the scene indicate that there weren't a whole lot of "Satanists" there to begin with, though they most likely didn't show up knowing that it was going to be canceled. The crowd had about a dozen protesters, but for the most part it was just curious onlookers. Pagans, atheists, liberal Christians, etc.  




 Bath salts. 




 Don't you think symbols and words have psychological and emotional power? Jung's Man and His Symbols is required reading for anyone wanting to explore this topic: http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/0440351839?pc_redir=1399608923 robot_redir=1 




 While LaVey dismissed much about occultists, he paid respect to the power of occult symbols and language. Here's LaVey on why he included the Enochian Keys: "Now you must know that every single occult scholar I knew warned me against publishing the Enochian Calls, saying that NOBODY touched upon them and it meant doom to even mention them. OK. That was enough for me. In they went. " (Forward to  Might is Right, 1996). 




 I'm not trying to shove my beliefs. OP asked for opinions and feedback on what the Satanic philosophy, as defined by LaVey, has to say about casual drug use. I provided the reasons and sources as to why such practices are not ideally Satanic. I didn't go knocking on someone's door telling them to put down the bong, they came to an open public forum asking for advice. For some reason my responses gave you some kind of anxiety.  

Again, not every single thing a person does in their life has to meet the guidelines of Satanism. Make up your mind, be responsible for your own actions, including stepping outside of the parameters of the Satanic philosophy if you feel it necessary. But as a representative of the Satanism I'll continue to make a clear case so where those boundaries lie. Again, **rational** self-interest. Mindless hedonism is anti-Satanic. 




 In Satanism morality is subjective. There are some fundamental guidelines to the philosophy (Eleven Rules of the Earth, Nine Satanic Statements, etc.) but otherwise morals are subjective to the individual and cultural norms of the time. Edit: That's why I asked you those questions, in order to get context to the scenario you're describing. There is no objective morality in Satanism (i.e. looking after you fellow man), only a rational analysis based on self-interest.  




 I essentially agree, one can indulge intelligently and take responsibility for it. I still contend that such actions put the Satanist in a weaker position, vulnerable to suggestion or manipulation, but I suppose if done in private you save yourself that worry. But ultimately, as a policy stance, the Church of Satan will not condone any illegal activity or defend anyone found to be in violation of local laws. 




 You give me quotes from famous, exceptional people. Great! Those are **exceptional** people. They are unusual; not typical. I suppose that's the crux of our argument, I do not share your optimism in that these benefits would carry to the general population. Just like alcohol. What better way to gain an upper-hand in a negotiation then by passing them a drink. For the record, I would add that yes, drinking alcohol to the point of drunkenness is antithetical to the Satanic ideal, a "sin" LaVey himself committed, just like I'm sure he may have given unwanted advice at one time or another, and thought some people were capable of more than they were (solipsism). If the time comes that certain "soft" drugs are legalized, the same thing would apply. I'm sure Satanists would partake in their legal recreation, but they would be putting themselves in less than ideal Satanic states. 




 I've spent about a decade in the extreme metal and electronic music scenes in NYC and can attest to a number of rapes, fights, and near murders done under the influence of acid or the use of acid. Did these people have other influences in their lives, possibly more so than acid? Sure, just the same as I would say it's effect on successful people. 

And then there's the research on psychedelic drugs as a tool for manipulating suggestibility. Are you saying that psychedelic drug do not influence your judgement? Because that's quite a bold statement. Now is this a good or bad thing? That's up to the individual and their own capabilities. It does not need justification, it is the logical conclusion of a set of principles. Now whether or not your see this as a flaw or you disagree, that's fine. This an aspect of Satanism you do not agree with, that's fine, you should feel comfortable with that if you are confident in your own experiences.   




 In the novel Venator operates inside the world of the Condor, who he opposes but realizes he needs to work within the system to live a free life. Through a series of manipulation, action, and stealth he achieves his ultimate freedom and shapes the world around him. Also read Peter Gilmore's Satanic Scriptures for a more directly Satanic take on the issue.   




 That's a fairly complex, and nuanced situation. I recommend reading Junger's novel Eumeswil. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eumeswil 




 I doubt LaVey would dismiss Jobs as a slave, I believe he had a Mac himself. Steve Jobs, and the various people you mention, had their vices, and faults, and became the masters of their craft regardless, and like you say, maybe had some assistance. But do you think if they didn't have their innate talents and intelligence that LSD would have opened those doors for them? Does that make drug use beneficial as a general rule? How about instead of Steve Jobs we use the various murders committed while on LSD. One can argue that underlying mental illness is the cause of these murders, not LSD. Well, maybe it's the underlying genius of these individuals that got their achievements, not LSD. Can't have it both ways.

Again, I go back to what I said before, the "ideal" Satanist would not do drugs, therefore the philosophy does not condone drug use.  

We're talking general use case here, since it's a general rule.  
*Why is drug use so bad? Why is it looked down on so much in Satanism? What logical reason is there for this unusual closed mindedness?* Because, it impairs judgement and control, *generally*. Now, individually, one has to decide what they want to do with their talents and abilities in the privacy of their own homes and lives, but do not use the Satanic philosophy as justification for it. Is that clear enough?  




 When did I say he had "so many" people groveling at his feet? I stated a metaphor to clarify a point. Some people got their mutual desires (payment, sex, attention), some got more, some got less. Some took a paycheck and went about their business.  




 I think you under-represent the power of manipulation and suggestion if you think that money is the only thing that grants you what you need (source: Wolfe who would discover that LaVey had various cars at his disposal to use when he wished, though not directly owned by him). In any case, for all intents and purposes, LaVey made enough money to get the things he wants. Court records show he died with enough money and royalties for his various family members to fight over. Now, did he live and achieve his ultimate Satanic ideal? I think so, but that's separate debate. Jobs wasn't a Satanist, and he seems very compulsive and illogical at various times in his life. So? Not all rich people are Satanists, and not all Satanists are rich. Does that mean they're not content, or maybe they have just reasons to be angry and bitter? 




 I pay for people I can easily manage and dispose of all the time. 




  "Rational self interest", actually. Use your head and your own creativity. Figure it out. Peter Gilmore in the Satanic Scriptures actually goes into the scenario of living as a Satanist in a Nazi-like totalitarian regime and how one can go about that. Work it from within, and when you have the chance or desire, overthrow it, Might becomes Right. Or work way into it and become part of the ruling party. Find the third-side.  




 In essence, yes, you would now be operating outside of Satanic ideals. Does that mean you should or shouldn't do those things? That's up to you, but those are you own conclusions. 




 His conclusions are very logical, actually. If you take Satanism to its logical conclusions it demands that you are in complete control of your capacities and are a master of carnal materialism. Notice his choice of words, which he was very careful about... "true", "ideal"... he's talking about the Satanic philosophy in its logical, ideal form. Now, are all Satanists adhering to "ideal" Satanism at all times? No, not at all. Heck, I'd even say that LaVey himself had his missteps and faults. Blasphemy! But he lays out exactly what his Satanic philosophy and religion does and does not entail and the ideals it upholds. It's up to each individual Satanist to decide on how they want to approach their own situations, be it medical or recreational, but do not try to justify all their decisions with Satanism, because that's not going to always work. 




 Paying for slaves is an age-old tradition, isn't it? There will always be people who you could call worthless to their faces and will continue to grovel before you. LaVey has uses for them, and often referred to them as "House Masochists", or useful idiots. 




 I think you're confusing LaVey using and manipulating hippies for his own purposes with "hanging out". 




 I still enjoy some of his work but do not agree with much of what he believes in.  




 Satanism. 




 In an interview with Fox News he brushed it off as a phase he went through. 




 If a musician or artist wants to use drugs to help their creativity, then great, but that's not Satanic. And a Satanist could enjoy that art or music, but all that means is we're enjoying the products of that artist, hence they are serving as entertainment. Not everything needs to be Satanic, but it's important to understand what is and is not part of the philosophy.  




 He didn't "hang out" with Manson's groupies. You must be talking about Susan Atkins. Again, she was a slave and LaVey used her for what she was worth, eye candy. The only thing LaVey liked about Manson was that he killed hippie culture and put an gravestone end to the 60's.

"It was during this public prankish period that Anton held his Topless Witches Review at a San Francisco nightspot in North Beach. One of the girls he hired to emerge menacingly from her coffin as a vampire was Susan Atkins. Atkins was not yet involved with Charles Manson and it would be two years until she committed the murders in Sharon Tates Benedict Canyon home, licking the blood from her fingers after the deed. But in her post-conversion expose, Child of Satan, Child of God, Atkins indicts LaVey as the catalyst for her downfall. Anton remembers her as just another Haight Street burnout, perhaps a bit more drug-befuddled than some. Shed beg off rehearsals, saying she had a fever of 108. But in the end she made a fine vampire." - Secret Life of a Satanist 




 He later rejected it and dismissed it as a phase. 




 LaVey was alive in the 80's and was greatly amused by the chaos of the drugs war. In more or less words, "they had it coming".  




 Exceptional people are just that, exceptional. For every Steve Jobs there are thousands of slaves, he just became a master of them. 




 LaVey, a bonafide hippie basher:  
1969: On August 8th, LaVey conducts a Hippie Ritual at the Church of Satan in which he bitterly curses the psychedelic vermin infesting the world. He calls for a purge to relegate the slaves to the pens in which they belong, catalyzing a new era of Satanic awareness. - Secret Life of a Satanist, Church of Satan documents.

And no, the "drug policy" is not just about hard drugs. Here is LaVey's directly addressing his thoughts on pot in specific:  
"The fact that I do not agree with the currently popular hypothesis that marijuana is harmless (some say beneficial) is of little relevance here, for my general lack of sympathy for "martyred" pot devotees is actually a result of another of my "weird" or "crackpot" notions - that one should refrain from flouting the laws of his society, even if he considers some of them as repressive or unwarranted. So much for legal technicalities." - Letters from the Devil, 1972 




 You can believe whatever you want to convince yourself to believe, but LaVey did not do drugs or tolerate people who did.  
"And then came the final flowering of the Drone: Hippies  the final de-evolution of man, to LaVeys mind  completely androgynous, convinced they were rebels against society (all 50,000,000 of them), and so zonked out on drugs they could no longer think for themselves or question anything that was fed to them (while they were all convinced of their individuality and uniqueness). What better way to make people vulnerable to attack than to pump mind-blowing drugs into them?" - Secret Life of a Satanist 




 Your assumption about the COS in the Sixties cannot be more wrong. One of the **reasons** behind LaVey starting Satanism and the Church of Satan was the mark the death to Hippie culture. He hated hippies and drug culture with incredible passion. LaVey did *not* hang out with hippies, it's been well documented (source: Randall Alfred, Burton Wolfe, various interviews) that LaVey kicked out marijuana-smokers, and a lot of the hippies in the San Fran area actually thought LaVey and the COS were way too conservative. The people who formed the early COS were lawyers, politicians, journalists, police officers, local judges, doctors... not a bunch of dudes in tie dye.   

The anti-drug policy **is not PR**. It is core to the Satanic philosophy. Over and over and over since the 60's LaVey has stated how much he rejects drugs and drug culture, how much it is anti-Satanic,  how drugs are only useful for slaves. How much clearer can it be? This is nothing new, this has been on of the most consistent and plain as day fundamentals of Satanism.  




 Atheism is not a religion. One can be an atheist and still have a religion. Most Buddhists are atheists. Atheism means you do not believe in gods, that's all. That is a small, but important part of Satanism. On top of that are a series of dogmas, rituals, aesthetics, shared cultural values, holidays, symbols, metaphors, and philosophy. That's what makes Satanism an atheistic religion.
  
 




 Is it acceptable in Satanism? No. Why are you looking for acceptance? See my quote above. Do what you want in private, but there's no justification for it under Satanism. 




 "Since there has much misinformation regarding the supposed use of drugs in Satanic ritual, clarification on that point is in order. The Church of Satan actively discourages the use of mind-altering (or behavior-influencing) drugs and the reliance upon physical or mental crutches of any sort. The "ideal" Satanist is a master and manipulator, and he takes a dim view of all devices that impair or weaken the excellence of the human mind. No drugs of any type are permitted at church functions. If you, as a "private" Satanist wish to use drugs, that is your prerogative, but you should also realize that such practice is antithetical to true Satanism". - Anton LaVey
 




 Also, if you're trying to achieve spirituality then you definitely need to look for some other religion, Satanism is not for you. 




 The point of Satanism is independence, having control of the material world, and *rational self-interest*, not "do whatever you want". Stop trying to justify your drug use through Satanism. If you want to partake in those substances, go ahead no one is stopping you, but don't use Satanism as the crutch to lay your guilt on. 




 That much, I can agree with. 




 Yes, and there are groups fighting it in various ways:

http://humanist-society.org/invocations/apply/ 




 Again, if you push the religion angle hoping they'll cave to stupid pranks, think again:  

Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes, in dissent in U.S. v. Macintosh (1931), suggested a semifunctional approach when he said, The essence of religion is belief in a relation to God involving duties superior to those arising from any human relation.

 I am involved in the political process, at least in terms of support of a particular cause. I've given hundreds of dollars to secular organizations that fight for the separation of church and state. I don't expect people to lay down, I expect them to play it smart, don't take the bait and play up the religion card. These legislators aren't stupid, once a legal precedent is set to allow prayers, all you are asking for next is legislation that defines what religions are and are not allowed to participate.

**1. Do not give opinions or advice unless you are asked.**  

Yes, going out of the way and sticking your nose in other peoples business to be the Good Guy contradicts Satanism. 

You are jumping to some dubious conclusions by branding this as a case of sexual degradation. Are women helpless children that need to be protected and looked after? Maybe they like or don't care that they're dating a sleazey guy. Let them make their own decisions and mistakes. If 
you have a personal issue and it's your home then kick the guy out or confront him. But that should be because you don't want to deal with bullshit drama.  

Edit: You come to this sub immediately claiming ignorance ([which could have been resolved with a simple Google search](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=satanism)), you take a pot shot at LaVey, and then another potshot at the philosophy. Not a good look. 




 And you're correct, they will see that accommodating "diversity" is costly, and under the guise of fiscal prudence they will determine what is "reasonable". 




 And here's the rub: **"reasonable efforts to identify"**  

The religious conservatives have this planned, the next step is to determine what is "reasonable", and now you have state sanctioned religions.

To attack this issue as a Satanist (demanding Satanic prayers, etc.) only reaffirms the position of allowing **any** religious observation, and which then brings in the question of what defines religion.  




 I knew there was a deeper reason why I liked this game so much. 




 "The Supreme Court has again affirmed that Americans are free to pray," said Defending Freedom Senior Counsel David Cortman. In America, we tolerate a diversity of opinions and beliefs; we don't silence people or try to separate what they say from what they believe. Opening public meetings with prayer is a cherished freedom that the authors of the Constitution themselves practiced. Speech censors should have no power to silence volunteers who pray for their communities just as the Founders did."  

And this is my problem with "satanic" monuments and prayers in school. Advocates are playing the game and took the bait. Courts are weakening their secular stances, and all it takes is a religious fundamental push and we'll have a system that then defines what is or isn't a religion, and you can bet there will be a list of state-sanctioned religions. You can see this playing out now with judges arguing that religions need to have spiritual significance in order to be considered a religion by the state. 




 Crowley didn't have a mustache... but maybe that's your poorly written point? Also, "Do what thou wilt" is not a Satanic motto, that's Thelema. But to the point... were you asked for your opinion or help? Why do you care? Do you feel the need to get a Good Guy Badge and be the white knight?  




 Here's Peter Gilmore on what Satanic Magic can mean to the those not ritually inclined:  

"So to be a master of magic, toss out those musty grimoires, unless theyre printed 
by Chilton. Pick some field and become an advanced practitioner. Be a writer, pastry chef, seamstress, flower arranger, plumber, sculptor, carpenter, photographer, upholsterer, electrician, pilot, beautician, steelworker, medic, whatever you have an affinity for. Youll amaze those around you, gain their respect and envy, achieve material success and you wont even have to say Shemhamforash in public. The better you are, the more Satanic youll be, a member of the true elite of the able. The sheep will be so dazzled that they wont even notice the Baphomet around your neckif you choose to wear it. But when they do, theyll certainly think theres something to it because of your position of achievement in the mundane world. We not only rejoice in the fleshy life, we are masters of it. That is Satanic magic." 




 You should absolutely be skeptical and inquisitive, but no need to throw the baby out with the bathwater.  




 "Satanic women don't want to gain their strength by castrating men, or by making themselves out as victims. Whether they're providing healing and inspiration to those under their roofs, cracking the whip in corporate circles, managing their own home-based businesses or maneuvering whatever they need to survive, all are applying and increasing their power - not whining about why they don't have any! We don't need "feminism" on our sleeve as our primary identity. We have our identity as Satanists. Satanic women are fierce; fierce defenders of their men, of their children, of their ideas and values. Wiccans understand the female archetype in a completely different way than Satanists do. We know that Woman is Nature - Darwinian law as well as peaceful, awe-inspiring sunsets. Women can be conniving and ruthless, plotting and vengeful. "Mother Nature" isn't loving and all-embracing. She's selective, cruel and unyielding." - Blanche Barton  




 Satanism is pragmatic, and realistic. To ignore the power of seduction, or to think that you can transcend the need for it, is naive. Do you "need" to use seduction in all facets of life? No, but to say you have no need for it ever just handicaps you. For a female perspective here are various Satanic Witches on the issues of feminism, seduction, and their roles as women and Satanists:

 Barbara Ehrenreich is a prominent atheist who's open to the idea of some kind of mysticism. FYI I do not agree with some of conclusions (that there may be some kind of unified mind/consciousness) but she does push the idea that one can be godless but try to reconcile some kind of materialistic mysticism.   

Here's her interview on the Point of Inquiry podcast: http://www.pointofinquiry.org/living_with_a_wild_god_barbara_ehrenreich_atheism_and_transcendence/  
 




 Atheist: person who disbelieves or lacks belief in the existence of God or gods.  

That's all. Many Buddhist are atheists, but they also believe in the supernatural. Within the Satanic framework, there MAY be some aspects of the human mind and within nature that some may consider to be "magical", but his *does not* necessitate in the belief in gods, demons, spirits, or anything supernatural. Satanism is a materialistic religion, so such experiences or observations should be recognized as being "carnal", of this world, and what some Satanists call "supernormal". 




 And that's fine. There are plenty of Satanists who have little to no interest in magic and are comfortable and confident enough to disagree and life their own lives accordingly.

 I'd like to post this to my Twitter feed, how may I credit you? Do you have a blog/page/etc.? https://twitter.com/InvisibleWar 









 I haven't read the original TDA it myself so I can't say for certain, but it's my understanding that this reprint (The Black Pope) revoked a lot of the material from the original. I did read through the Black Pope and it felt like Wolfe had a thick ax to grind with LaVey, even though he does note his historical importance. Wolfe's "new findings" are questionable at best, and often got basic facts wrong. TSLoaS is Blanche Barton's biography of LaVey, so there's a certain adoration in the style, but she did her homework and it shows. Writer Kenaz Filan is working on an extensive biography of LaVey, which you can follow at his blog here: http://kenazfilan.blogspot.com/search/label/satanism 




 The [author reprinted the book and Amazon lists it for about $15](http://www.amazon.com/The-Black-Pope-Devils-Avenger/dp/149483491X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1398876348 sr=8-1 keywords=the+black+pope+devils).

 Sounds like you have tokens filled with fond memories and security. Go with it. 









 All depends on the emotional attachment you have to these items. A pocket knife that once belonged to a dear friend or a hiking staff that supported you when you were physically spent or hurt would be worth many times more than any "occult" commodity.

 I very rarely eat potato chips and always go with popcorn or Pirate's Booty puffs if available! 




 Depends on the situation. I am both an Atheist and a Satanist, I will divulge one or the other, or none, depending on the circumstances.

 What would you gain from initiating such a debate? Do you think you'd actually "win someone over"? Would you want to? I doubt anything productive would come about this kind of constant confrontation. Apply the Satanic Golden Rule: "Do unto others as they do unto you". If they're leaving you alone, let them go about their business. If someone is trying to force their ideals on to you, then go for it. 




 It looks like it's a cheap reprint, see this: Publisher: CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform (April 1, 2014).   

CreateSpace is an Amazon company that allows authors to publish cheap prints.  




 "Priests" and "churches" existed long before Christianity, and they will long after. We use these terms with secular connotations, our priests are artists, scientists, engineers, writers, entrepreneurs... masters of the material world. Our church is a network of people with common cultural interests.  




 If you want something to hold you over I *highly* recommend getting [Letters From the Devil: The Lost Writing of Anton Szandor LaVey](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0557431735/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8 camp=1789 creative=390957 creativeASIN=0557431735 linkCode=as2 tag=underwoamusem-20). So many questions and issues brought up on this reddit sub are similar to the letters written to LaVey in the early days of the Church of Satan. I've often referred to this book in response to questions here. You get a clear picture of his sense of humor, practicality, and sense of understanding of the human animal. 




 Blanche Barton has a new, expanded edition in the works. Last I heard she's in the publishing stage. It's certainly a book worth reading but would hold off unless you're looking to collect an early edition. 




 Agreed. It's a common potshot against Satanists to say we're all going for the film noir, LaVey look, or trying to be a shock rocker. I think some young Satanists pick up on that look at first, attracted to the image. They usually soon out grow that, or drop Satanism all together when they discover that no else is impressed by playing look-a-like and the shock turns to schlock.   
Aesthetics should also be take context into consideration. If we're doing a ritual or ceremony using symbols from a 1940's movie, then yes you'll see Satanists dressed the part, otherwise they'd ruin the Total Environment.  




 What I'm getting at with all these photo links of other Satanists is that the "Satanic look" is a personal application of each individual. A Satanist recognizes archetypes and does not shy away from using them to his or her advantage, knowing the power of aesthetics. Some of the most successful Satanists that I know very rarely wear their Sigils of Baphomet out in everyday life, but if you take a peek at their work, presentation, and life philosophies you should be able to pick up a few hints of the diabolical.  




 For a more punk rock taste, there's Tibbie X-Kamikaze, of influential NY Punk bands Reagan Youth and X-Possibles.

 Here's a photo and bio of another one of my favorite Satanists, Sean Bonner http://magazine.good.is/articles/good-100-meet-sean-bonner-measuring-air-quality

"Sean Bonner has a hard time explaining what he does. An activist, entrepreneur, journalist, and enthusiast, he has worn enough hats to open a haberdashery. Bonner has been a Senior Designer at Playboy, and the Creative Director of Victory Records; he is the founder of Coffee Common, a customer education brand, and Crash Space, a hackerspace in Los Angeles.   

Bonner has organized conferences and unconferences including the first BarCamp in Los Angeles and The New Context Conference in Tokyo. But wait! Theres more! Bonner recently launched the clothing line Burn In Hell A and is part of the multimedia art and music collective Cross My Heart Hope to Die. He has been a regular contributor to BoingBoing and has written editorials for MAKE and Al Jazeera, among others.
 
His current project, Safecast, is a global sensor network that has been measuring radiation levels in Japan. Safecast will be looking for volunteers in Los Angeles, expanding their citizen-driven data collection to log air-quality information. Volunteers will be taking measurements by placing air quality-logging devices outside people's homes, expanding to other cities as kinks are worked out." 




 The "Satanic" aspects of our wedding were in the metaphors and symbols we used. People "in the know" picked up on it, but everyone else didn't have a clue and thought it was just an atheist wedding. We married on April 30th, Walpurgisnacht, on a cliff-side at sundown. The day celebrates the arrival of spring, so as the sun set on one chapter of our lives, a new one awaits. We started the ceremony with a reading from Goethe's Faust that calls out people's fear of superstitions and the unknown:  
Who fears today  
His rites to pay,  
Deserves his chains to wear.  
The forest's free!  
This wood take we,  
And straight a pile prepare!  
Yet in the wood  
To stay 'tis good  
By day, till all is still,  
With watchers all around us plac'd  
Protecting you from ill.  
With courage fresh, then let us haste  
Our duties to fulfil.  
The poem describes a party who are taking refuge in the woods on this night. They send out guards dressed like ghosts to scare away their attackers, using their own foolish superstitions against them.
