 The bull moose jolly roger waved proudly in the air as the crew ran to their stations. "Captain Teddy" as he was affectionately known to his men, began barking orders left and right for cannons to be loaded and weapons drawn. The first volley of cannonballs nearly ripped the entire side off the merchant ship (the SS San Juan). 




 A contract is by nature an agreed upon set of rules.

I never agreed to your society, and I never agreed to your social contract.

If you are assuming inaction = consent to your social contract, by that logic I can start a house cleaning business in which I wash all my neighbors houses, send them a bill, and then lock them in a cage when they refuse to pay. I will assume their inaction by not moving out of the neighborhood is consent to my contract. 




 Because some of us think the same rules that apply to individuals apply to the government.


If I offered to protect your house even though you never asked me to, and then threatened to throw you in a cage unless you paid me 10% of your earnings, would that be legal?


The government uses coercive force to extract taxes to pay for an involuntary contract which we see as inherently unjust. 




 Where does Zen Buddhism fall into this framework? 




 Everyone wears black berets with their dress uniform.


Airborne troops in an airborne unit (like the 173rd or 82nd) wear maroon berets in their dress uniform and a few other occasions.


Soldiers who are a part of the 75th Ranger Regiment wear tan berets. 




 One type of law or one law?

If I could nullify all laws related to governmemt involvement in the markets that would be my highest priority. 




 Please explain the variations and sects of Buddhist practice in layman's terms. 




 Read Hazlitt's *Economics in One Lesson*.

Ron Paul's *End the Fed* is also a wonderful introduction. 

 




 Exactly. Obedience to God's commandments is thd proper response to his love. Christianity is not about some warm and fuzzy feeling in your heart, but a way of life. The word "disciple" comes from the same word as "discipline".  




 2001 A Space Oddysey by Arthur C. Clarke 




 I carry these [little memorandum books.](http://imgur.com/a/OaRRs) I carry one for work and one outside of work. At work I post daily to do lists, important numbers, serial numbers, information etc. I use my personal one as a catch-all for my brain output. I jot down library lists, quotes I hear, snippets of ideas, subjects I want to learn more about etc. When I get home at night and begin my daily journaling routine I take the seeds of ideas from my pocket notebook and elaborate on them in paragraph form in my journal. I think this practice has made me much more introspective and mindful. It encourages me to engage the world around me for information and ideas to better myself on a daily basis. 




 If so what kind, what do you write in it, and how has it added value to your life?

 You are going to make time for things you value. If you have time to play video games you obviously have time to read, you just have to convince yourself that reading is of greater value to you. Try intentionally contemplating the merits of being more well-read vs the instant gratification you may get from other activities. 




 Its ok, good parts and bad parts.  




 I was homeschooled. I would have gone to Murphy due to school zoning. 




 That saddens me. My wife and I are actually in the process of getting foster care certification, and we specifically want to care for abandoned special needs children.


 




 Well, I live at Fort Drum.

I am from Mobile though. 




 I got hooked on [these](http://www.amazon.com/Memorandum-Books-Green-7530-00-222-0078-12-pack/dp/B0053D9X5M) from the Army. They are absolutely phenomenal. At $20 for a 12 pack they dont break the bank.


[Here](http://imgur.com/a/OaRRs) is my actual notebook. 




 No. I don't put myself in female company if I might lose control of my tongue.  




 Raise the child with total devotion. I don't shirk my responsibilities. 




 I think you should talk to a counselor instead if a bunch if internet strangers. 




 I only live about fifteen mins from there, no shit 




 CSM listened to my bio, heard thst I was from Alabama. 

"SPC train_subject9974 do you know Forrest Gump?"

I then explained to him that Forrest Gump is my granddaddy, and that might explain why I am a little slow.

Sergeant Major didn't ask me any more questions. 




 Amazing. We need more men who shoulder responsibility instead of running from it. 




 This is a horrible idea. This kind of confrontational Christianity gives us a bad name.

Most Atheists come to their position after a lot of thought and study. Many of them already own copies of the Scriptures.  




 Not as dark as blood meridian. There is some plot resolution, but not the big jackpot of happiness.

I would recommend you read it for the prose alone. McCarthy does such a phenomenal job of painting the picture with his words. 
 




 I don't think it ever would drastically.

I for one am a happy and lifelong carnivore, and would never give up the bountiful blessing of meat. 









 No, it is not racist. 

Too many folks want to cry racism for petty things. If folks from generations past would see the things we cry the racism card on they would turn over in theor graves. 




 1. Laziness is deplorable to me.

2. Stand up for those who are weaker than you. 

3. Treat ladies with deference. I do not curse in front of ladies, hold the door open for them etc.

4. Being responsible for my actions. Playing the blame game is deplorable.

5. Being a man of my word. If I say I am going to do it, I am going to do it.

These are a few of the things thst define masculinity to me. 




 1. Thinking a man should not cry is bullshit. Men are humans. Humans cry. Emotions are natural.

2. There is a difference between having natural emotions and being a thinskinned crybaby. Life sucks. People say shitty things. Part of real manhood is learning to shrug off people's insults. I would say a man who is constantly whining, always getting his feelings hurt, etc is not a developed man. He is a baby. 


I cried when my good buddy died. I do not cry when my supervisor yells at me. 




 Christian belief system summarized; humans are all broken sinners who are mutineers against the Law of God. The punishment for such mutiny is death. Christ (who is God) died on the cross to pay the legal debt of that mutiny. He then rose again defeating the power of death and sin. By confessing our sins and believing in his sacrifice as sufficient alone for our salvation, and surrendering ourselves to Him as Lord and Sovereign, we can have our sins forgiven.


My beliefs are summarized briefly in [The Nicene Creed](http://www.reformed.org/documents/index.html) and more in depth in [The Westminster Confession of Faith](http://www.reformed.org/documents/wcf_with_proofs/)

The differences between denominations are very nuanced and hard to explain in summary. It really depends on which denominations you are asking about. Basically there are three broad divisions

1. Roman Catholic - believe in the authority of the Pope, and the various vatican counsels as authoritative.

2. Orthodox Christian - recognizes a different patriarch than the Pope. They have their own cultural heritage and body of teaching seperate from the RC church.

3. Protestant - products of the protestant reformation. There is extreme diversity within this broad heading. 




 My wife and I went into our relationship agreeing that she would be a housewife and I would be the breadwinner. We established the boundaries of our roles early on, so it has never been a problem. She works a littlw business on the side, and volunteers at the USO as a shift manager. 


I think the important thing is to establish your opinions on what role you each will take before your relationship gets serious and there will be no problem. I don't expect every couple to have the same dynamic my wife and I do, but if you are the kind of guy who cannot marry a career woman, don't. If you are the kind of guy who believes your wife needs to have a career, then don't marry someone who does not. 




 I keep a high and tight. (I am in the Army, and old habits die hard. It will probably be the only hairstyle I have for the rest of my life).

I get my hair cut every weekend. I think every man should have a great barber. I love my barber shop, its a man's retreat. I actually look forward to my weekly cut. My barber gives my high and tight, shaves the sides of my head with a straight razor, and gives me a hot towel massage. All for 11 bucks.

Day to day I use brylcreem to keep my hair parted and combed.

With regards to the ladies, I am married so I don't gove a second thought to what the ladies think. My wife loves my hair. She loves right after I get a cut and the sides of my head are smooth. She also digs the smell of brylcreem.

[I will throw in a photo.](http://imgur.com/0AaorQi) 




 Nah, I am like that. I don't  get crazy when I drink a lot, just chill out. I do get more social confidence, but that is about all. 




 Nothing but circlejerks. Bush this, Hillary that.. Oh my gosh did you hear about Romney??? 


And lil' old me just waiting for someone to say something about Ron Paul. 




 I call my wife "bookend". She likes it.  




 "Objective" means impartial, unbiased, not dependent upon the mind for existence, factual, etc according to the OED. 

So actually that is what "objective" means. 

 




 Because I belive morality is clear cut black and white. Objective. 


 




 Sometimes what is pleasurable is not what is moral. There can be conflict.

I believe our desires are not to be trusted. 




 Because I believe adamantly in objective morality, I would prefer if more folks pursued moral excellence. 




 I keep three; a book journal (green rite in the rain notebook), a personal journal (a nice piccadilly), and a pocket notebook which is an integral part of my EDC (an Army memorandum book).


What about y'all? 




 No. Books are about content not aesthetic. 

I mark my books up, they get battered from traveling around with me around the world (literally). I think worn books are well loved books. 




 What general info? 




 Not full seriousness.

It is a word I made up because I am a man. Its definition should be clear, and my genius irrefutable. 




 Ron? Is that you??


Can you believe some people don't like breakfast food? 




 Hell yeah. I love sushi. That shit is addictive, and it will fill you up faster than you think! 




 It was asked in half-seriousness. Chill out. 




 I love steak and eggs. It is my annual birthday breakfast. One seasoned t-bone medium rare, three hard fried eggs, potatoes o'brien, and strong black coffee. 




 What hearty meal is your go-to for celebration or merriment of the soul? 




 Nope. Just a sheepdog. 

When you spend as much time as I have in violent situations, you just get wired different.
 




 Some points to relay


1. I disagree with Thomas Paine on a good many things, he was not a classical liberal but way more progressive with his statist ideas.

2. My issue with food stamps was not how they were carried out, it lies with the fact that I find them fundamentally immoral.

3. I despise the idea of a fiat currency. I am not a keynsian. I suppory austrian economics. 




 Its not that I am not for unions. I fully support the right of voluntary association.

I just don't know of a single union I could support, because they support things I disagree with. 




 No. Because I would not ha e sex with a girl I am not already in a monogomous relationship with. 

I would never seriously date a girl I am not attracted to. I would never have sex with a girl I am not seriously dating. 




 Depends on the scenario. 

If there was a reasonable threat I would step in physically. I am fully able to handle any physical situation that presents itself.

If she was just uncomfortable, I would ask her if she wanted help. I would not want to make her more uncomfortable though. 

Basically, if she was getting verbally harassed it would bleep my radar to keep an eye on her (I have a wife and sisters after all). If things escalated I would physically step in, take charge, and diffuse the scenario with whatever force was needed. 

If she is drunk, she cannot consent. Women are equal in value, but usually not in physical strength, build, and demeanor as men. As a soldier, and a southerner I would feel obligated by my code of honor to watch out for any female (or male) in a possibly dangerous situation. This is the life of a sheepdog. 




 My family recieved food stamps and is still on them.

I rejected any government assistance on moral grounds. I will not take government assistance, because I believe using the coercion of the state to take one person's money and give it to the needy is not compassion but robbery. 

I am all for charity. I have in the past accepted charity from my church, and would have no moral issue. That money was given to the church freely. I would *never* accept govt. assistance though.

  




 This is exactly the problem. 

If an Uber driver rapes a customer, the company should not be responsible. The company did not rape the customer, the individual driver did. The state should punish him for his act of aggression, and hin alone.


I believe in individual, not collective responsibility. 




 I have skipped way more than seven meals before. That is why I am a capitalist. Growing up in extreme poverty, in a state that had huge subsidies, and government intervention, I oppose that philosophy with every ounce of my belief.  




 Mt. Doom. 


My nemesis would be Frodo Baggins. 




 He is establishment in the sense that he has no original ideas. I believe both parties are equally big government, equally militaristic, and equally power hungry. Anyone who supports those ideals is establishment. Folks who actually want a smaller government (like Ron Paul was) are antiestablishment. 




 It is the biggest thrill of my life for sure. 




 I remember our DS riding with us.. Quiet, not smiling. When we pulled in, the Kraken was released.  




 Nope. 

Here is a [link](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laissez-faire) that explains laissez faire capitalism.

We believe there are free market solutions to your problems. Monopolies are nearly impossible to achieve without government help. Many monopolies pop up because the state excessively regulates the industry so that new guys can't get in (think about the Uber controversy).  Labor and consumer protections would come from the private sector. You would have consumer watchdog organizations offering analysis of products. You will also have stupid consumers who buy without doibg theor research, and they woukd have to live with the consequences of buying without research. 




 When bombs started hitting around me and I was responsible for the lives of two other soldiers besides myself. 




 Yes, I understand that is how it works now.

That is not how laissez faire capitalists believe it should work. 

That is why Romney is not a capitalist. He is a mixed market corporatist. 




 A market with no government intervention. No Federal Reserve, no minimum wage, no government regulation of the market.


We believe the government should only punish and prevent acts of aggression. Nothing else. 




 Thank you for your wonderful answer.

How exactly do you see your stream of libertarianism as different from AnCaps? I think I can agree with everything you said. I believe workers should be allowed (not forced) to unionize, I don't see much difference between coop's selling products in a free market and individuals selling products in a free market.
Under your system, would individuals not be allowed to own business unless they were cooperative? 




 No, the individuala in that corporation have those rights and liabilities. 

Corporations would not exist as they currently do in a free market system. They get their power from tax breaks and preferential legislation. 

I am not against shareholder protection. I am against **all** government involvement in the free market. 




 No I wouldn't. I did not vote for Romney, or McCain. I voted for Ron Paul in both of those elections.

I will repeat myself. Fuck voting along party lines, I vote for individuals. 




 Corporations are groups of people.

The point is that corporations don't have rights. Individuals have rights. As capitalists, we do not view the world collectively, but individually.  









 Thank you! 




 Capitalists would totally oppose the idea that "corporations are people". In a free market, corporations get no government treatment. We embrace the concepts of individualism.

We (capitalists) would never support bailouts, or any other state intervention. Romney does not think like this. 




 Because state run healthcare is capitalism?

Romney is as far away from capitalism as FDR or Mr. Obama. Romney supports corporatism.

In a true free market, without legislation benifiting corporations, I doubt Romney would have the status and wealth he does. 

 




 I think Romney had a real chance of winning. The reason I am happy to have him out, is because I think he was the biggest threat.

I don't think Bush or Christie has anywhere near that kind of pull. 




 Probably. Empty heads usually get the nod.


That does not mean I will vote for him. Screw voting on party lines, I vote for individuals. 




 I am ecstatic. As a libertarian-republican, I adamantly oppose his pseudo-conservatism. He is an establishment republican who would just prolong the current big state republicanism that dominates the GOP. 

Now if we could only get Jeb Bush out of the race...

 




 Reuters and BBC are my main news sources. I also listen to NPR pretty regularly. I think the quality of American television news is abysmal. Jake Tapper is pretty good. Fareed Zakaria is decent. I also enjoy John Stossel's show on Fox. 

I like getting news from opposing perspectives (which is pretty much everyone, since I am a libertarian). I do *not* like news folks who just use their show to stir up bullshit. I am talking about guys like O'reilly, Hannity, Maher, Morgon etc... 




 What do you think about their insistence on the reality of class warfare? Is class warfare true? Is it necessary? Is it good? Are there free market solutions to worker exploitation?
Where exsctly does Socialist theory go wrong? I realize there are many flavors of socialist thought, but what are some fundamental ways they err?
What are your opinions about a socialist society existing within a larger free market? A voluntary association of individuals who buy a large amount of land and establish a society in which means of production are collectively owned, planned economy is established etc..?

 Can y'all recommend some good books and articles that would give me a cursory overview of dreaming? I am curious to learn more about what actually happens when we dream, where the content of our dreams comes from, theories about significance of dreams, etc?

Can y'all help. 




 Not sure where to ask this...

I am looking for repectable books and articles about the psychology of dreams. Most of the stuff I find on google search is hardly respectable.. I am curious to learn about the various theories about the causes and effects of dreams on our psyche...  




 Combat vet as well. I agree with everything you said. 




 Which branch launched the largest amphibious assault in U.S. military history? 




 Find an NCO and relay that the Airmen can't salute properly. I would say that's about the best you can do besides making on the spot corrections. 

I would probably just tell their NCO that they have not been saluting properly. Give it time to see if that clears it up.

They are still recruits, so expect some ignorance about customs and courtesies.  




 Sure,

Peter explains how Christ took our sin upon himself in 1 Pet. 2:24, and 3:18. This is the idea Him taking our unrighteousness and sin-wages, and giving us His right standing in return.

John echoes this idea in 1 John 1:5 (where he explains that there can be no darkness in God the light, thus explaining our separation from God) through 2:3. He explains exactly what Paul said, that Christ is the propitiation for our sins, and that those sins are forgiven through confession.



 




 The reason we apply the RPW (which you will fins explicitly in the last statement of WCF XXI vs 1, that we are forbidden from worshipping any way not prescribed by holy scripture") to worship is because we believe Sunday is the Lord's day, the Sabbath, and we are obligated to keep it in accordance with the explicit way He instituted, lest we dishonor the Sabbath. 

We don't apply the same principles to the business aspects of the church, because there is nothing holy, no obligations commanded in regards to budgets, interior designs, etc. 

Our church government is not centralized, but very decentralized. It is not independent though. The scriptural precedent for oversight above the local church is found in Acts 15, qhere the Jerusalem Council exercised oversight on the matter of Greekness vs Jewishness. 

We believe there is nothing holy or significant about a name. Our name is simply another necessary business aspect of church organization.  




 Sure, 

Romans 3:10-20 outlines that none of us are righteous (or in right standing with God). 

Romans 3:21-26 Paul explains the idea of Christ giving us right standing through his sacrifice ( what Paul calls "propitiation through his blood").

Romans 10:9 explaina the way to eternal life as confessing our sins, aknowledgement of Christ's Lordship, and belief hid death and subsequent resurrection. 




 By virtue of who we are (the original sin that defines us) we face a twofold death. First, a literal death (which is inescapable), and second a death beyond that death. The second death is eternal death, separation from God (who is the essence of life) forever, and banishment to hell. 

The path to life is the confession of our sin, and surrender of ourselves to Christ's sovereignty, aknowledging belief in his death on the cross as a substitutionary sacrifice that bore the weight of our second death and his resurrection as a victory over both deaths.  




 I don't know. I don't care about any sport, none of them add value to my life, so my opinion probably is not too helpful. 




 A know a lot of vets have trouble transitioning into civilian life for this very reason.  




 Yes. Shit rolls down hill. If they are yelling at me, it is because they got yelled at. 

Even if it is not my fault, a little ass chewin never hurt anybody. Like I said before, the Army is no place for someone with thin skin, or someone who thinks so much of himself that he can't take someone else's ass chewin. 




 I am looking for books about labor unions, especially labor unions pre-WW2. 

I am interested in non-fiction, biographies, fiction, or anything else dealing with the subject. 




 Well, it is a part of a larger effort to impose composting on the residents.

They are trying to force folks to compost, and fine them for not doing so. 




 Oh we can take care of that. A few motivational runs, and Drill Sergeant watching every bite you eat, ready to pounce on your ass for even looking at cake proves to be an effective weight loss solution. 




 Which is why folks with significant sleep issues are subject to discharge. If you have bad sleep issues, they likely won't let you enlist in the first place. 









 I agree. As long as my supervisor does not try to fire me or take admin action against me unjustly, it would not bother me. They can say what they want, I just listen, agree, and move on. They will forget about the whole thing in fove minutes and so will I. 




 "I am sorry First Sergeant, I have no idea why he would try to drink windshield washer fluid."

"Subsequent asschewing by Top on the dangers of not properly briefing your soldiers on the dangerous nature of household chemicals."

^ **Actual conversation I had with my First Sergeant** 




 I will not miss being chewed out, but I will miss being in an organization with clear directives and clear feedback on my performance of those directives.

I would prefer an asschewing to getting fired. 




 If you don't aknowledge the texts from your leaders, you can prepare yourself for hell when you come back to work.

We are obligated to answer our phones at all hours of the day, any day.  




 Either have respect pounded into them, or have thei life made a living hell. 

Drill Sergeants have a unique way of stimulating respectful attitudes, even among the most antiauthoritarian of individuals.


We will never have another draft though, at least not in our lifetime. Most soldiers I knoe would not support such a thing anyway. I don't want to go to war with a bunch of guys who don't want to be there, you cannot trust folks like that. 




 Profitable in the sense that essays can be effective ways to communicate ideas in short form.  




 I get chewed out regularly. I am in the Army. As a squad leader, I not only get my butt chewed if I make a mistake, but also if one of my soldiers makes a mistake. I even gdt chewed out if I am in the same room as any soldier making any mistake. Since I outrank them, I am held responsible for their behavior. 

How do I react? I stand at parade rest, agree with them, take my punishment and move on. The Army is no place for kids with thin skin. Ass chewings are a guarantee in this line of work. 




 Counting sleep, about 9 on the weekdays.

Sometimes more on the weekends. 




 Rarely. 

After watching my good friend get killed.  




 Nope. I have very specific reading goals, to-read lists spanning years out from now. For a book to even get on my reading list it needs to be recommended from a respected source.

I get most of my books from the library. I only buy books I know would add value and dimension to my personal library, I have specific qualifications.

I also don't like the idea of subscription boxes. 




 Many writers, Atwood, Asimov, Chomsky, Umberto Eco and T. S. Eliot included have found essays to be a very profitable way to deal with ideas.  




 Let's talk about essays. Who are some of your favorite essayists and why?

Also, which essays have had an impact on you? 




 quiet and pensive. 




 Nope. 

But I was homeschooled, with ample freedom. My mom let me choose my own education route with few exceptions. I think this very experience solidified a love for reading in me. 




 I never said there were successful current markets. It has never been tried properly. There has always been government overreach. 

New Hampshire's free state project is moving slowly towards something close. No income tax, no sales tax, no tobacco tax, no taxi regulations etc.

The internet is a somewhat applicable example of a free market that works pretty well. 




 We believe acts of aggression to be issues unrelated to regulating the market. Sure, they have an effect on the market, but making slavery illegal does not make the market unfree. 

We believe humans have three basic rights, life, liberty, and property. Those rights cannot be infringed upon. You cannot take someone's life in aggression, cannot take their liberty, and cannot take their property. This is not regulating the market, this is protecting liberty. 

If I murder the CEO of a large company, would that have some effect on the market? Sure. Does that make murder a free market issue? No. Just because the market is free, does not mean our other rights are nonexistent. Each individual owns himself. You should be allowed to work and sell and buy without state intervention, but you are never allowed to commit acts of aggression. That is the fundamental premise of right libertarianism. The market is free, and you are free, you are simply not allowed to hurt people, own people, or take their stuff. 




 Slave labor is a violation of the nonaggression principle. It has nothing to do with being a labor issue, it is a basic liberty issue. A libertarian society would operate under the assumption that everything being legal except acts of aggression.

If a child comprehends a contract, and is willing to trade his services in exchange for wages, I am fine with that. We would have to have lawyers that ensure the child understands the contract fully. If he is in any way being coerced into working, it is an act of aggression and therefore illegal. Again, nothing to do with regulating the market. The child must be able to comprehend what the contract means, and left free to quit that association whenever he/she wants. Otherwise, I see no problem with letting them decide if they want to work.

BTW, you will note in my original comment I never said I was a full ancap. I lean ancap. I believe the existence of night watch state is necessary. I believe the state should only intervene to prevent/punish acts of aggression. 




 I agree with that 




 Laissez faire capitalism is incompatible with socialism. We believe it *totally* free markets, socialism believes in a planned market. 




 First, I don't like identifying as an anarchist. I agree that anarchism is a leftist ideal. I prefer the term voluntaryist.


In a totally free market, money would not equal power. You would be free to exchange anything you have for anything another has so long as they agree. You could exchange time, produce, gold, cloth, anything that you can use to barter for another item you want.  




 I would not classify myself as anarchist, that is a title applied to us by outsiders. I prefer the term voluntaryist.

I am a true capitalist. The market should be totally free. 




 No, because parents are not holy. They are finite and sinful people just like everyone else. I am not obligated to obey them if their demands are sinful.

God is perfectly holy, so he would never demand anything that was not perfectly holy.  




 I do not, but I would also like to see such statistics. 

I think a lot more people are sympatetic to our cause even if they don't totally identify as ancap (as long as we use words other than "anarchist") 




 Because he demands it, and as my sovereign Lord who bought me with his blood, I am obliged to obey. 




 As a libertarian..

Not even remotely. I do in fact believe the government should have no role in infrastructure. I lean anarcho-capitalistic. I am an absolute laissez-faire capitalist. 




 Vienna sausages on ritz crackers. 




 I have a to-read list. 

If I am headed to my bookshop I will make a shorter list, choosing the books I would like to read most and I give that list to my bookseller. She crosses off the items she does not have in stock, and I pick up the rest.

I usually ask my bookseller if she had recommendations since I last saw her. I take her recommendations into consideration. 




 U.S.  




 I understand there is a lot of controversy about the possibility of this leftist party winning. 

Who exactly are they? I understand they are leftists, are they democratic socialists or more communistic?

What is their platform?

If they gained power how would Greece change? 




 Either Tommy Lee Jones or Clint Eastwood. 




 Yeah, the railroad has some wonderful benefits I have heard.

 




 I am assuming they are gonna make him finish basic now and finish his enlistment obligation without getting out.

Thwt is what return to duty means. 




 I have read others, the Q'uran and bits and pieces of Buddhavacana. 

It was not quantifiable. I do believe faith is a gift of God. All men are dead in soul until he brings them to life. So it is nothing a man can do on his own to instill faith within himself.  




 Rand Paul is the best option right now IMO.

He is not perfect, but he is certainly not a neocon. I think definitely a step in the right direction, though I wish his father had won more than anything. 




 He is a religious neocon. 

He is a social conservative, outspoken against libertarianism.

Against legalization of cannibis, for affirmative action, vague on foreign policy (by his associates I assume typical neocon).

I am not a huge fan. I am hoping for Rand to run, he is the best option in my book.  




 I love nonfiction books that explore blue collar work.

I would also like to read novels with blue-collar characters, focused on the struggles of working class life.
