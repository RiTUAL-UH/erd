 Hmm.... This logic does make sense. I shall be scared no more! I will wipe with confidence on my next outing! 




 I'm scared the more TP I use, the higher chance of me clogging the toilet and having it overflow. 




 I was in class watching Pearl Harbor, the movie. This happened when I was in 11th grade. I am one of those people that laugh all the time and have a hard time pulling back my laugh.
So as we're watching, the scene where the Japanese are attacking Hawaii there's a part where they drop a bomb near a guy who's hiding behind some sandbags. The bomb doesn't explode and the guy yells, "It's a dud!". And a second later the bomb explodes! My friend just turns to me, and says in a stupid tone, " So it wasn't a dud?". I couldn't hold it and I start cracking up. The whole class is serious while watching the movie, and I'm over here laughing while people are dieing left and right 




 That toilet paper looks like it's two-ply at least! Better than Disneyland and their thin stuff I'm currently using!  




 That was a freakin nice pass! The way Perry recieved the puck without slowing down was perfect! 




 Condoms! Condoms the size of hefty bags!  




 Haha I didn't forget, those just happened to be my favorite ones :3
