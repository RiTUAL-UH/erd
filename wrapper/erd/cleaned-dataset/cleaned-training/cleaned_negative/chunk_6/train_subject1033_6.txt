 Some outlaw wanted to live out his Wild West gun-boi fantasies, and he wound up getting his fondest wish.
 




 Because ***the black helicopters are coming!!1!!one!!1!*** 




 How else can they keep the abortion issue alive?

Republicans fear nothing more than losing their #1 wedge issue.

They know they can't run on their 30+ years of failed "trickle-down economics." They need a rage issue to continue to divide people, and abortion is their huckleberry. 




 They just wanted to talk to her about Liberty. 




 But why? Why must we kiss the corporations' asses day in and day out to hold the country together, or so we've been taught?

Isn't the burden of proof on them to show it *isn't* a dangerous practice?

I think the Founding Fathers would puke themselves inside out if they could see how Americans cringe and grovel on their knees before the throne of today's new Monarchy of Profiteers.  




 Shouldn't We the People know what is being injected into our land? Don't we have a right to know? Are we scared of hurting the poor -widdle-petroleum-cortorations-fee-fees?

Or do private profiteers "trade secrets" take precedence over our safety? "What they don't know won't hurt 'em!," right?

  Because i've been around it for the last 2 years and know what i'm talking about.

Translation:"My paycheck depends on defending fracking."

 




 Why won't the industry disclose what's in the fracking fluid? 




 This, much like Bruce Springsteen's *Born In the USA,* again proves that Republicans should actually ***READ THE LYRICS*** to the songs they misappropriate for their jingoistic rallies.

"Rockin' In The Free World" by Neil Young

There's colors on the street

Red, white and blue

People shufflin' their feet

People sleepin' in their shoes

But there's a warnin' sign

on the road ahead

There's a lot of people sayin'

we'd be better off dead

Don't feel like Satan,

but I am to them

So I try to forget it,

any way I can.


Keep on rockin' in the free world,

Keep on rockin' in the free world

Keep on rockin' in the free world,

Keep on rockin' in the free world.


I see a woman in the night

With a baby in her hand

Under an old street light

Near a garbage can

Now she puts the kid away,

and she's gone to get a hit

She hates her life,

and what she's done to it

There's one more kid
that will never go to school

Never get to fall in love,

never get to be cool.


Keep on rockin' in the free world,

Keep on rockin' in the free world

Keep on rockin' in the free world,

Keep on rockin' in the free world.



We got a thousand points of light

For the homeless man

We got a kinder, gentler,

Machine gun hand

We got department stores

and toilet paper

Got styrofoam boxes

for the ozone layer

Got a man of the people,

says keep hope alive

Got fuel to burn,

got roads to drive.


Keep on rockin' in the free world,

Keep on rockin' in the free world

Keep on rockin' in the free world,

Keep on rockin' in the free world. 




 What a foul desecration of an amazing song. 









 So some outlaw wanted to live out his Wild West gun-boi fantasies, and he wound up getting his fondest wish.

What's the issue?

 




 I've been continually amazed how many American Catholics worshipped Benedict and despise Pope Francis.

American Catholicism needs to free itself from its poisonous alliance with American Evangelical Fundamentalism. 




 Christian Nationalism been the unidentified elephant in the room of American Politics for nearly four decades now.



 




 The American Right doesn't give a damn about children, especially once they arrive.

But relentless exploitation of the ***"ZOMG ABORTION!!1!"*** issue sure is a useful tool to manipulate the votes of Christian Nationalists. Anti-abortion hysteria gets many Americans to vote in complete opposition to both their own interests and the best interests of the country.

Does anyone actually believe the Republicans want to lose their favorite wedge issue?

That's why today's Republicans will ***never*** allow abortion to be banned in America. The abortion "debate" brings the American Right Wing too many votes.


 




 If there's one thing that defines Christian Nationalists like Santorum, it's pride in their own ignorance. 




 Sounds like another act of Duggary. 




 But... but... he heard it on AM radio! 




 Oh, Cliven. 









 When has consistency or reason ever been applicable to the politics of Christian Nationalist Republicans? 




 True. It runs about 17%-20% and is already calculated into the purchase price of goods.

It confuses the hell out of Europeans when they come here and an item marked at $5.00 is suddenly $5.45. 




 Kansas: the Kochbertarian Paradise! 




 He lives in the Republic of TeaBaggia.

 Do you have enough jerky stored away in your Revolution bunker? Maybe you should go check. 




 Clearly it's because they love "LIBERTY!!!1!"^TM 




 Another fine representative of "the Party of Personal Responsibility." 




 America deserves better than a third Bush disaster. 




 Sorry, NC. You can't use the force of the State to subject women to ultrasonic dildo rape. 









 Why do people still fall for it?

Sometimes, I almost believe there's a subset of poor Republican voters that just flat-out enjoy the continued degradation and the humiliation.

Even today, the sharecropper still forced to lick the boot of Master still fancies himself higher than a slave. For some people and some voters, maybe that's enough in life.

Nonetheless it seems clear that this pathogenic belief is some foolishly clung-to remnant from the psychology of the European peasantry of centuries ago along with their love/worship of the very hereditary Monarchs that oppressed them so relentlessly. That attitude was transferred to America in the form of the class and caste structure of Antebellum South, and we fought a war that killed 740,000 of us to free ourselves of that remaining horcrux of the Monarchy, the landed gentry of the Plantation Class of the Old South. America all but destroyed itself to liberate itself from that deep-rooted poison.

150 years later, I see little difference in how so many still vote in complete opposition to their interests and that of the nation. It's not "the Gub'mint" that's the threat to our Nation; in fact, "the damn Gub'mint" is the only thing standing between the relentless privateers of capital and commerce who seek to own all for themselves and their families at the expense of all others living in unending servitude to our new Monarchs, the Monarchs of Capital.

So those who who join militias with the intent of "restorin' the Constitution" and "fightin' for our Liberty" should not be at all surprised when they wake one day to find they fought in "the Great Struggle" just to make a Koch their King.*

American stubbornness is not a virtue when it is so relentlessly self-destructive.

*See Libertarian Adam Kokesh's call for "the Final American Revolution" on July 4 a couple years back, or the continued self-delusions of the Sovereign Citizen/Bundy Ranch Milita zealots who fantasize themselves "Patriots." 




 "Why did non-wealthy American voters keep falling for it?" This is the question political historians of the future will ask.

How did the United States  a nation that survived the Age of the Robber Barons, the Great Wall Street Crash of 1929 with its ensuing Great Depression, and the Financial Meltdown of 2008 and its ensuing Great Recession  not learn the lessons repeated again and again within each circumstance?

Hell, let's pre-empt the political historians of the future. I'll ask the question now: "Why do non-wealthy Americans (and in many cases, dirt-poor Americans) keep falling for it?" 




 Republicans have been playing the "the liberal media are persecuting us!!1!" myth-lie ever since Nixon introduced it in his "Checkers" speech.

[Here's the "Checkers" speech on YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqjwBDH-vhY) Give it a listen and hear how Nixon whines and whines and whines about persecution just like the Republicans, Libertarians, and Republitarians today.

Highlights: when Nixon complains that (unlike liberals' wives) his wife Pat Nixon doesn't wear a fur coat, but a "respectable, *Republican* cloth coat" and also invokes the namesake cocker spaniel "Checkers" and how "we're never going to give her back, no matter what *they* say.

It's a masterpiece of self-pitying whining that the Republicans have looked to for inspiration for over 60 years now. Watch it -- it's really worth your time.  




 Ellis! 




 The Kochs' father was a founding member of the John Birch Society. 




  fuck that entire family.

That will just make more of them.
 




 Are there *still* Americans nave enough to consider tripling-down on the failed Bush Family?

On second thought, don't answer that. :/ 




 Josh Duggar? 




 Poe's Law, or RWNJ? 




 Luxury! In LibertyWorld, she'd also have been charged with bleeding on the tracks. 




 The Iowa GOP straw poll was doomed the moment the 2012 vote-buying schemes of Ron Paul and Michele Bachmann came to light. 




 The multigenerational self-delusion continues; the resentment poisons us to this day.


 




 That's been a struggle in society since there has been society: mutual suspicion and resentment between urbanites and rural residents.

This has to end. Our lives are all intertwined and interdependent. We must acknowledge this if we are to have a chance at taming those who profit from the exploitation of each of us against the other.

 




  Hahaha, this guy doesn't know Republicans. They will just double-down on the stupid, blame Obama or the nearest Democrat, and profit.

I still can't understand why  is it simply spite on the part of these lock-step voters? If they can't have control, they'd prefer to run the ship aground for all of us?

Why is it that these self-declared "Patriots" and flag-worshippers, America's *de facto* Nationalist party, seem so hellbent on burning our nation to the ground?

Republicans, Libertarians, Republitarians of Reddit: what's the motivation here? What's your endgame? 




 Stopping Reconstruction (at the demand of the South) was even worse.

The War to Preserve Slavery that the poor white sharecroppers were sent to fight killed 750,000 Americans, all for a cause that was already doomed years before the Confederates fired the first shot.

The descendants of these same poor white sharecroppers have misdirected their contempt at Washington DC ever since. It's probably just too painful for many of them to look in their own backyard and realize that they destroyed themselves to keep the Plantation Owner class in power (even a century-and-a-half later after it spat out their dead and broken bodies on that Fool's Errand.)

As always, war is a rich man's quarrels via the suffering and death of the poor, who are sent to fight the battles. 




 It's abortion, the gays, and violent video games. 




 Another "tacticool" weapons fetishist. 




 Luntz' evil genius. 




 Or Moderators decide to declare it "Not US Politics," Off-Topic," or "Rehosted Content."

Somehow, *Breitbart*, *CNS*, and *WND* are just fine, but *Salon*, *MediaMatters*, and *Talking Points Memo* suffer under de facto censorship.

That's information that you and I aren't allowed to see, thanks to the intervention of self-appointed Censorship Mods who act in complete opposition to the Reddit creed of "user-driven, user-curated content." 




 Yeah, the whole Lawrence crowd has been starstruck since *The Day After.* 




 So you'll vote out of spiteful opposition at a random anonymous person "smug"?

That's sure giving a lot of power to the "smug" person over your life.

Why cut off your own nose to spite someone who you don't know and will never meet? Seems pretty self-destructive. 




 The GOP is utterly and evilly brilliant at exploiting wedge issues to get Americans to vote against themselves. 




 He's speaking of restaurant chain/fast food chain workers. 




 Hey, those "Small Business Owners"^TM and "Job Creators"^TM will spare no expense to serve their customers! 




 And then the very same scamsters rushed back in and bought those same properties for pennies on the dollar.

Uncontrolled capitalism is far more dangerous than any monarchy. That's the great irony of the United States: having been founded as an independent nation in opposition to the very concept of Monarchy, we now live on our knees before our new Monarchs: the Titans of Capital.

 




  As someone who grew up in one of those "Christian" churches, I can attest that they hate democrats as much as they hate black people, women, and homosexuals.

But why? I'm continually baffled by this.

From whence does that virulent hatred come, and when did it start? Are they still sore over the Civil Rights movement? The New Deal? Richard Nixon's cocker spaniel?

Is their compulsion to inflict their destructive spite against their fellow Americans so great that they are oblivious to the grievous damage they inflict upon themselves? And if so, how can they *possibly* claim to be "followers of Christ?"

Maybe the Evangelical Protestants simply *believe* they're following Christ when they've fallen prey to a scam by "the Great Deceiver." Given the aura of hate, fear, divisiveness and greed that right wing politics has promulgated in America in the last hundred years under the cloak of "morality," it's an idea that merits consideration. 




  The people doing the tax cuts, aren't the people feeling their ramifications.

The ultimate question: why do so many of the people who suffer the worst under the Republican's trickle-down economics so readily and zealously lick the boots of those forcing the suffering upon them?

Yet more confusing: how/why do the poor boot-lickers getting stomped the worst insist that they are "the freest people on Earth"? 




  The working class became the working poor and we are all in debt the ultra rich. That doesn't spell prosperity to me.

It does to the Kochs and their ilk, who bestow names such as "Americans For Prosperity"^TM on their Astroturf front groups.
 




 *tap tap tap* 




 I wonder how Bob Dole feels about what Brownback is doing to his home state. 




   How to destroy a country, one State at a time.

Koch-onomics!

 




 Explanation: "It allows us to scam votes." 




 Sorry, Bernie would never never have anything to do with right-wing extremist charlatans like the Pauls.

Conversely, the kind of people who worship the Pauls (White Supremacists, Neo-Confederates, Militia wannabes, and conspiracy theorists) would never have anything to do with Bernie. 




 But... but... what about the JOB CREATORS!^TM ??? 




 There isn't any such thing as a "moderate Republican" anymore. 




 How has the American economic abortion known as "trickle-down Reaganomics" continued to hold sway with so many for so long? 




 ZOMG teh TYRANNI!!1!! WE needz teh "LIBERTEH!!1!"^TM

[Send me your worthless fiat currency and I'll send you a newsletter 'splainin' it all!] 




 "Social Justice Warrior" is the new "statist;" everyone that uses the thinks they're brilliant, insightful, and "in the know," but everyone who hears it is laughing their asses off whilst rolling their eyes.

Yes, Libertarians and Republitarians, this means you. 




 Rasmussen, haha!

might as well go back to citing "unskewedpolls.com" as proof that Romney was going to sweep in 2012 




 Who should we call if the government is infested with Southern Avengers? 




 Well, it's not a *completely* lost cause.

After all, Rand can keep fleecing the rubes that fell for his dad Ron Paul's "LIBERTY!!1!"^TM schtick in 2008 and 2012! 




 Well, after Rand's dad Ron Paul quit his 2008 campaign, he threw his support for president to Dominionist preacher Chuck Baldwin of the Constitution Party.

Maybe Chuck will return the favor by nominating Rand for his VP this time around? 




 He's going to fleece paranoid right-wing rubes, just like Dear Old Dad trained him. 




 He's yet worse  a Republitarian. 




 The mouldering corpse of Murray Rothbard. 




 I nominate Rand Paul's son William Paul as his chauffeur.

William Paul is also well-versed in how to handle flight attendants should they get a little mouthy and/or cut off his drink service.
 




 What's controversial about Lew Rockwell? 




 Sy Sperling! 




 Adam Kokesh. 




 Lew Rockwell. 




 Also, while we're at it, get rid of the bogus "Not US Politics" and fabricated "Rehosted Content" lies that have been used to censor our community for the past two years.

Reddit is meant to be ***USER***-driven and ***USER***-curated; *NOT* ***MOD-DICTATED*** or ***MOD-CENSORED.*** 




 How about you guys stop censoring us with the bogus "Off-Topic" and "Rehosted Content" lies? 

You guys don't have to answer to the Gunbertarian-Authoritarian censors anymore. Why mimic their old patterns of systematic censorship?  




 It's one of the favorite tools of the Censorship Mods, though they don't pull it nearly as frequently now that the Gunbertarian Mods who seized power a couple of years back have been forced into exile.

It's generally used to kill content they deem "liberal." The "Rehosted Content" lie is another favorite excuse to censor our community. 




 Oh look! The Censorship Mods have hit us with the "Off-Topic" lie again.

I guess that leaves little hope they'll do away with the "Rehosted Content" lie they invented to auto-censor submissions from Salon, MediaMatters, and Talking Points Memo, is there?  




 And I *did* realize I was dealing with a Tea-Gargler. Bye!

 Or maybe it's because his Dad Ron Paul and Michele Bachmann were both involved in cutting Iowa straw poll payola checks to create a false illusion of support outside their circle of RWNJ loonies. 




 He knows how hard it is to put food on your family. 




 Scott Walker is in Wisconsin, not Michigan. Nice RWNJ dodge, though. 




 The battle Scott Walker *should* be fighting: getting the Kochs' balls out of his mouth. 




 Why do so many of the Tea-Gargling Militia "Patriots" seem to head to Wal-Marts when it's time for their "Last Stand"?

Another fine example here:

[The Chilling Anti-Government, Cliven Bundy-Loving Facebook Posts of the Alleged Las Vegas Shooters: Jerad and Amanda Miller's Facebook and YouTube likes included the NRA, Rand Paul, FreedomWorks, and other right-wing championsand videos justifying the killing of police officers.](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/06/jerad-amanda-miller-las-vegas-shooting-cliven-bundy-anti-government)
 




 "Sovereign Citizens" are nothing less than domestic terrorists.

 America's been taken hostage by right-wing extremists, and many voters suffer from Stockholm Syndrome. 




 Science is just for Damn Commies anyhow. 




 Most Americans have little vacation, and what little we do doesn't afford most Americans the ability to ever travel overseas (to say nothing of the expense of international travel.)

We're a perfect little prison colony of compliant slaves, if only because we've never known anything else. America's permanent leisure class intends to keep it that way. 




 I've never understood why Americans scream so much about how the US is the only place on Earth that has "FREEDOM!"^TM even as we let the permanent leisure class rape any remaining human will out of us. 




 Also, does anyone else remember when California bars and restaurants argued "ZOMG teh bans on teh indoor smoking will utterly destroy us and kill ***ALL*** teh buzinezzez!!1!"

That was over two decades ago. Shockingly, California still has bars and restaurants. 




  we would most likely see a hefty dip in the stock market.

ZOMG we couldn't *possibly* dare to trouble the passive, profit-harvesting investor class, could we? We must work and work and work for them until all those who seek their profits from the exploitation of the labor of others feel that they *finally* have enough to achieve personal satisfaction.
 




  The fact that I KNOW the GOP will be against this makes me feel like I live in bizarro world. You'd think everyone would be okay with this.

It's truly startling how many Americans vote in complete opposition to their own interests.

The Kochs and their leisure-class cronies make no such foolish mistakes. In fact, they fund disinformation campaigns specifically designed to keep Americans from voting in their own interests.
 




 This is why it's so important for the many negative-knowledge voters who currently vote Republican/Republitarian to begin voting in the interests of themselves, their families, and the nation instead of for the sole benefit of their leisure-class Masters.

America's extremist, regressive right-wing must be brought to heel lest America return to the horrors of Victorian-Era economics. 




 Much of the South (and Americans in general) just can't seem to escape their "there are Lords (us), and there are Peasants (everyone else) who just won't learn their proper place" economic worldview.

Such belligerence, arrogance, and greed caused the Plantation Lords of the Old South to launch what remains the bloodiest war in American history, in which over 700,000 Americans were killed.

The sad thing is that so many of the poor, undereducated sharecroppers who are inevitably sent to fight and die for the Master Class will *still* defend those Masters to the death and call their devotion "Patriotism." It's almost as if they have been conditioned to expect and enjoy their own exploitation.

*Maybe* someday they'll snap out of it and actually begin to vote and work in the best interests of themselves and our nation, rather then spending their lives on their knees cringing before the Bossman  but American history teaches us to temper any such expectations.
 



 




  According to one survey

CATO or Heritage Foundation?
 




 And just look at the fight we had to put up against the Republicans for even that simple accommodation way back in the Clinton Era.

"Pro-Family/Party of Family Values" my ass. 




 Please go into as much detail as possible. What would you see as the positives of such an abortion ban? Would there be any negatives? 




 Yes, that's what's makes it all the more frightening.

Nationalistic fringes bent on moral crusades will self-justify any behavior to reach their goal.

An excellent novel that addresses similar issues is Margaret Atwood's *The Handmaid's Tale.* 

 




 More Republican pandering to their right-wing fringe.

Kowtowing to such extremists rarely ends well. 




 With nasty, big, pointy teeth! 




 There's a lot of rumbling, grumbling, and chest-puffing coming from the White Nationalist/Neo-Confederate/Gun-bertarian Militias in recent times.

I wouldn't be surprised at all if these groups have seen an uptick in recruitment due to the "ZOMG JADE HELM 15!!!1!" paranoia they've managed to promulgate on the Internet. 




 Agreed, but Rand would never chance his toupe flying off on camera.   




 Is mocking Rand's drunken, car-crashing, flight attendant-assaulting son William Paul OK?

Why does Rand deserve any credit for that most other sentient political observers have noted for years?
