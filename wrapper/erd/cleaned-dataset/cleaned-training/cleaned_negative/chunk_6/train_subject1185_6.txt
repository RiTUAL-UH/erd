  Too stupid... Too pretentious.

Ignoring how oxymoronic that statement is, what did you think was pretentious about Death Proof? You made some great points about the characters and the dialogue, but I'd like to hear more about this.

I love Death Proof, but it is - by far - his weakest film he directed, but it's way better than Planet Terror. 




 I don't think it's underrated, just forgotten. 




 Everything Henry Jackman has done. Captain America: The Winter Soldier was dismissed by critics as just copying the music from the first one which is so inaccurate it hurts. He made the bar fight in Kingsman even cooler and made the emotional beats of Big Hero 6 really land.

[This is my favourite song of his](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgU1HzqtX-E), but if people are looking for something to listen to whilst revising or showering or whatever, definitely go over the Winter Soldier soundtrack. 




 I knew which song it was before I clicked on the link. It's a truly excellent song. 




 I'll PM you. 




 Something... Something... Fire gasoline...

Why's Bowie saying Gasoline anyway? He would call it petrol. 




 Absolutely. Well, just not on Earth. I'm down with the other realms.

It's kind of a shame as my two favourite Thor runs are Aaron's and JMS' 




 Sarah Jessica Parker as Beta Ray Bill 




 This should give you a pretty good understanding of the entirety of the MCU. You'll need to Google some of the reading orders.

* Dr Strange - The Oath
* Captain Marvel - Brian Reed's run
* Thor - Ragnarok, JMS' run or Godbomb
* Blanther - Christopher Priest's run or Secret Invasion tie-in
* Guardians of the Galaxy 2 - [This epic saga](http://i.imgur.com/FUM3v.jpg)
* Infinity War - Infinity Gauntlet
* Captain America - Brubaker's run on Captain America and, for the love of Thanos, don't read Civil War
* Inhumans - Paul Jenkin's run
* Jessica Jones - Alias
* Iron Fist - The Immortal Iron Fist
* Luke Cage - Bendis' New Avengers
* Punisher - Greg Rucka's Run
* Ant-Man - The current run was only commissioned so they'd have a trade for the new movie, they're just lucky it was really good. Different Ant-Man, but I really enjoyed The Irredeemable Ant-Man.
* Daredevil - Frank Miller's Run (including Born Again and The Man Without Fear), Daredevil: Yellow, Battlin' Jack Murdock or Bendis'/Brubaker's runs.
* Iron Man - Demon in a Bottle, Armour Wars, Doom Quest, Fraction's run, Extremis
* Hulk - Planet Hulk, Hulk: Gray or Hulk: The End
* Shield - Hickman's or Waid's run
* Hawkeye - Fraction's run, Lemire's run or McCann's trilogy
* Black Widow - Brubaker's Winter Soldier
* Avengers - The Ultimates I   II, Busiek's run, [Bendis' run](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m815zi24Ga1rpok63o1_1280.jpg) and Hickman's run

Get yourself Marvel Unlimited as well as it's the only possible way you could digest all of this.

Edit: I forgot Spider-Man - Ultimate Spider-Man, JMS's The Amazing Spider-Man, Spider-Man: Blue and Kraven's Last Hunt (which the third TASM movie was going to be based on). 




 I must add though, JMS' Spider-Man is the definitive 616 run for me. 




 Spider-Man's is the only one I really like. I'm not really a fan of Rogue's Galleries, I prefer a couple great recurring villains and one-offs.

Edit: I forgot The Flash's. That's the definitive set of rogues for me. 




 Is Walt really a psycho? Fucked up sure, but I'm not 100% on a psycho. 




 Lord of the Rings - please don't downvote me as /r/movies always does. If you'd care to hear why ask and I'll PM because I'm fed up of receiving abuse for not liking three movies. Same for Jurassic Park and Jaws. 




 Ehh. I find he goes too over the top and the frame is too hectic it's unclear what's going on and that bugs me. Also the editing is typically too fast too see much. 




 thanks.  




 One? I think you mean five. 




 You've made me reconsider and you're right on all accounts, but your point about Bucky is null.

Bucky was brought back with the intention of becoming Cap and had 30-odd issues of development before becoming Cap and was a more nuanced and clever character than Captain African-American who was ill-thought out. 




 It is somewhat for Doom, but it is exactly the kind of thing Magneto would get upset over (pre-Morrison). Doom crying is more of a symbol than anything else. 




 I love the Falcon. As a POC, Falcon really meant a lot to me. Since becoming Cap he's been boring and two-dimensional outside of his own book and his own book is only average. Captain African-American is an insult towards the creators and editors who thought this was a good idea, not Sam Wilson, a character I miss dearly. 




 Read it before you judge it. It's an excellent story that doesn't exploit or pander anything. It is surprisingly politically neutral and very poignant. The point of is that nothing really matters in the wake of a tragedy like this.

Also I think a creator trying to pay his respects should be admired not accused of pandering. 




  I'm not sure if they ever faced off in a one to one capacity.

Does the first arc of New Avengers count? 




 Demon in a Bottle and The Runaways 




 So like Warren Ellis' interpretation. 




 That's cool - I respect that and easily see why. He's just not for me. 




 And New Jurassic Park. 




 I actually really like it. I find it charming and Spielbergian. If it had Spielberg's name on it and it was made 25 years ago, it'd be a classic. 




 Can You Dig It? is the song's name and it is awesome. 




 So I take it you're a big fan of The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, The First Avenger and the Thor films? 




 He's always sucked. Snow and Heart of Ice are Two good stories with him in. Anything featuring Mr Freeze out of the 90s has been pretty poor. 




 He's a pretty good villain, but I can't think of any of his stories I enjoyed him as the primary villain.

 Oddly, Bay does these the best. I can't stand much of what he does, but these I love. 




 Lex is the only one there I really like. I've always considered Darkseid a Justice League villain and always thought of him as a force of nature and he isn't particularly compelling. His Marvel imitator is much more layered and complex. Brainiac doesn't really work for me - not sure why, but he's never clicked well with me. Doomsday is the epitome of 90s excess had he not killed the bastard he's be quickly forgotten about like Spawn, Nate Summers and the Savage Dragon. He's the worst kind of Superman villain - the one who Supes just has to punch into submission.

Edit: I still love some of Supes' other villains like Zod or Bizzarro. 




 Superman and Batman.

All of the best Superman stories are about exploring the idea of Superman and what he truly means to people and only three of his villains really help show that - Luthor for obvious reasons and Zod and Bizzarro as their perverted takes on Supes.  Anytime a story just involves him punching stuff I get really bored.

Batman has some colourful villains, but most of them should have been left in the silver age. The Penguin is a crappy substite for an actual mobster like Falcone. I find Poison Ivy kind of boring and gimmicky and - once you get past his back story - I feel the same way about Mr Freeze. Catwoman is poorly written more often than not, which is a shame because in the right hands she's really interesting. Bane had an excellent first appearance, but has fet a bit pointless in the last twenty years and I can't think of another great story with Bane as a villain. Ra's Al Ghul is kind of a nice look at an alternative to Batman, but it feels like no writer has known what to do with him since the 80s. Man-Bat is just an excuse for a cool action sequence or two (see: Grant Morrison deciding that Man-Bats made for suitable grunts for the League of Assassins). I can't think of a single Ventriloquist story I like. Same goes for Killer Croc, but I did love Earth One's take on him.

The funny thing is, most of this characters have faired really well in adaptions (particularly in the cartoons). Mr Freeze earnt Dini and Timm a very well-deserved emmy.

The greatest Batman villains are one-offs, James Gordon Jr, Deacon Blackfire, The Court of Owls, Nobody, The Black Glove and Mr Whisper are my favourites.

Like Superman, Batman has three truly great villains, the Joker, Two-Face and the Riddler. I love a good Joker story, but currently I'm so sick of the character. Well over a quarter of Snyder's run has featured him and I'm just kind of fed up of reading about him. Two-Face doesn't really work that well as an enemy of Batman, but he works because he's such a compelling character. Half a Life, The Long Halloween, The Big Burn, Robin: Year One and A Lonely Place of Dying are all fantastic stories that really dig deep into what makes him tick and I find that fascinating and very entertaining. I used to kind of dislike the Riddler, but after Zero Year and Earth One he's in my good books. 




 Both great stories, but I can't think of a single Mysterio Spider-Man story I enjoyed. 




 Love the costume BTW.

You just need to ask two questions - is it important to Grant Morrison's Run or is it a defining moment for one of the Robins or Barbara Gordon? If yes, the important element is in continuity, but nothing else is.

May I ask what you read? 




 Does Batman count?

He's nowhere near the smartest, but I think Dexter is a pretty clever cookie. In the first four seasons he weaved out of so many problems so brilliant, only to be let down by his conscience. 




 I say good time travel movies, you immediately think of X. 









 Same boat: I'm trying to read through the canon of great graphic novels and read a tonne of classic Batman stories whilst also trying to catch-up on the X-Men (6 years behind) and Avengers (4 years behind) on Marvel Unlimited. Then I get distracted as Image release a new TPB for some charming new series and Comixology's recent sales have resulted in myself purchasing 38 issues of Hitman and Steam is having a sale and I want to play the new games I'm getting and complete my old ones. Then I have TV series and Films. 

Oh, and homework, but that's not important. 









 Should try and keep reading Ultimate Spider-Man, Bendis has done some of his best work on Miles. 




 Is this a Matt Fraction issue? 




 Being explicit is one of my big pet peeves. I love subtlety. There are points where being explicit kills shows like the Walking Dead or the movies of Christopher Nolan - things that I'd otherwise enjoy a lot. 




 I imagine a little bit of things like that will leak through, but they'll skip most of his origins like Daredevil. 




 I understand. No one take offence - he's not calling you disrespectful - it's just that a lot of people worked hard to make a movie and by sitting through the credits you're acknowledging the hard work everybody did. 




 How about the Sentry? The complicated backstory and identity issues make him quite interesting IMO (although, not nearly as interesting as Superman). 




 I imagine it'll be like Daredevil. It starts crazy grounded then the fantasy elements start leaking through in the second half. Season Two will probably drive straight into the mysticism. 




 The thing that truly surprised me about Season Two is how complicated the relationships between all the factions are. You've got Shield, Hydra, Real Shield, Ward, Cal and the Inhumans and there was lots of weaving and character moving in and out of each group.

It was like this; it was super easy to follow and I didn't really realise how well balanced it all was until I stopped and thought about it. L 




 RemindMe! 1 Day 




 Scarface 




 Really? I enjoyed the film, but it felt like the exact thing the novel was mocking. 




 I don't now whether many people like Agents of Shield on this sub, but I feel that having 22 episodes helped the plotting quite a bit. They divided the series into three distinct chunks - Search for the City, Skye Dealing with Power/Real Shield and the Inhumans - this meant there was room for some pretty complex plot webs and character work. People who were previously kinda boring became interesting thanks to having episodes dedicated to expanding on their character (looking at you Ward). The cast is also too big to deal with the 15-odd characters in 13 episodes. Coulson, Fitz-Simmons, Skye, Ward, Mack, Hunter, Mockingbird and May all got pretty decent arcs in Season Two and most of them would've been forgotten about if there was a 13 episode season. 

Managing to tell three stories actually makes it similar to three four-issue comic book arcs which I guess is quite faithful to modern comics where everything is quite decompressed and it takes a while for things to pay off. This is kind of the opposite of the Flash which had a Silver-Age meets Claremont  plotting; one wacky conflict every week with some soapy elements and foreshadowing future episodes. Agents of Shield tried this in Season One and it didn't really work, but come Season Two's more serialised plotting, it was a vastly improved show (helped that they got some decent directors and fight choreographers too). 




 The Flash was pretty decent for 23 episodes, but if they tried to tell a more serialised story in the first fifteen episodes, it would have completely broken down and would have needed a reduced episode count. 




 Succeeded in Punisher MAX. 




 Days of Future Asst 




 I really like it - if it is a bit derivative of Green Lantern (which Nova is anyway) - but I think I'd prefer him brutal and war-hardened than some kind of Space Indiana Jones as we already have one of those. 




 Jim Lee bore this with a sort of humble patience 




 I love Invincible, but I've found it's lost a lot of momentum for me recently. It's a shame because everything up to the Viltrimite War is great. 




 CG isn't as big a problem for Robbie Reyes, so if they went down that route - which I'd quite like - Netflix could handle him. A redesign would be pretty simple as well - you can just tone down the fire.

I don't want a Netflix Ghost Rider series though - I want all of the Netflix series to stay relatively grounded for a while. If they do a phase with Moon Knight, Blade and such, then they can have Ghost Rider. 




 Wait! Other people have read Tech Jacket? I fucking love Tech Jacket! 




  Miles Morales and Kamala Khan. At least not yet.
 

Damn right. These are two of my favourite Marvel characters at the moment - or at least two of my favourite Marvel book, Miles is a bit bland - but a lot of what makes them great is how they've both slotted into their uniquely well-established worlds.

Although, more diversity is always a good thing, you can't force them, otherwise you end up with Fem-Thor and Captain African-American who have both been flops in my opinion (which is a shame as I love both Aaron and Remender). 




 Is it any good? 




 Not just good, those were excellent. It's in my Top 5 Ultimate Spider-Man arcs. 




 Unless it's, you know, Microchip or even himself. 




  Greg Rucka, Tim Seeley, Gail Simone, Jason Aaron, Matt Fraction, Brenden Fletcher, John Layman, and even Brian Michael Bendis 

I love most of these writers, but you listed 7 white guys and one white girl. While I admit, they all do an excellent job of writing people who aren't white males - although I can't think of many great female Aaron characters, hopefully Southern Bastards will change that - I wish there were more minorities working in comics.

This isn't really a response to you, honestly, more I'm just not that fond of the way the industry has shaped up. I can only name a few creators that are racial minorities or female and I feel the same way about film. I don't know whether I can blame DC or Marvel for that, but I'd like to see more. 




 Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man, Spider-Men and Miles Morales: Ultimate Spider-Man 




 So you've read one volume of Ultimate Spider-Man? Why not try the rest of it? 




 Did you read all of the Miles Morales stuff? 




 I didn't like this arc, I thought it was a bit of a let down after the excellent Jim Starlin. 




 That may be a while. Right now, it looks like it may go on forever. 




 It might be that the writer spent years constructing the first season and only one on the second. 




 I dunno, he must watch a lot of crap. 









 John Oliver 




 This is probably the weakest of the three. The banter wasn't very entertaining, the action lacked impact, the animation had no weight, Trevor reminded me of a Cable-esque 90s hero and their relationship was kind of cheesy.  









 That's reserved for the Hawkeye/Daredevil miniseries. 




 It's like DC's Ultimate Universe. It modernises and redefines popular characters.  




 shh! They're onto me. 




 I love it. 




 Agreed, but I think those parts were there as a service to the actor.  




 Could you please post the next page? 




 Will the wait for vol. 3 be as long as it was for vol 2.? Johns left some interesting ideas open and I'm dying for them to be explored.

Are DC planning on expanding their Earth One universe further? I love the idea of lots of graphic novels being released each year.

Are the other Earth One books worth reading?

And most importantly, what does /r/DCcomics think of Batman: Earth One and it's alternate takes on characters? 




 Fuck the bastard that stole it.

Edit: Sorry this isn't very helpful or constructive, it's just how I feel about arseholes who pull shit like this. 




 The visuals in The Raid 2 are very good. There's a really gritty sense of style to all of the action scenes. The choice of colours in the production design and lighting also helped make the talkier moments much more enthralling. 




 Pretty much, yeah. 




 So whoever is posted first gets an almost guaranteed place? L 




 Is there a  particular franchise you've wanted to score for? 




 Francis Manapul and Jeff Lemire. 




 Miles Teller, Nicolas Hoult, Idris Elba are all big ones I agree with. 

I'd like to throw in Kate Mara and Iko Uwais. 




 For a second I was all like, "Frank Grillo? I fuckin' love that guy." Then I read Taylor Kitsch. 




 Oh dear lord. This will be shite. 




 You're going to be so disappointed; the director of The Expendables. 




 Funny how you compare an Alan Moore movie to a movie inspired by the works of Frank Miller. 




 The Killing Joke is too short. It'd only inform half an hour of a movie. 




 The Raid is one of my absolute favourite franchises. I can't wait until the US remake butchers everything I love about it.  




 Just like 80% of Grant Morrison's run... 




 Because it's an unpopular opinion that could be viewed as contrarian, especially considering I didn't really give any reasons why I didn't like it. It's equivalent to defending Marvel Movies or saying you don't like Lord of the Rings. 




 Does anyone know if the comic is as good? 




 Angel Savadore and Beak's weird, deformed babies. 




 That's what I get for being too dependent on my phone's spell check. 




 I watched Jurassic Park for the first time last night and I must say I was underwhelmed. 




 Fast 5. When they decided they were turning too many people off with the car talk and decided to focus on action.  




 Punisher/Doctor Strange 




 Bendis' White Tiger - the ex-FBI lady who gets hold of her uncle's amulet. 




 Michael Cudlitz and Marc Warren. 




 I'm not sure Shakespeare shared Morrison's love for the silver age, but I can see that. 




 I don't want to turn this into a "how bad was Civil War" thread, but how fucking bad was Civil War.

[I actually wrote a review of it.](http://thelatestpull.com/2015/02/marvel-monday-civil-war/) 




 There were some decent tie-ins (I particularly liked Front Line and New Avengers) but reading it all was killing me. 




 I can't imagine 616 Cap doing that. Civil War isn't exactly Millar's best work. 




 I really hope not. Doomsday is the epitome of 90s OTT comic trash. In the comics he was severely underwritten and most of his appreciation comes from the design - like a lot of 90s comic characters (Venom, Lobo, Savage Dragon, Spawn). Some characters - like Cable and Bane - have redeemed themselves in later stories, but Doomsday really isn't one of them. 




 I don't think Lex will be a villain at all. I'm imagining a motally bankrupt antihero. 




 Come September, the only founding Avenger still around in their original persona will be Iron Man. Being a founding Avenger is not as a big a deal as people make it out to be. 




 Y: The Last Man movie or a Batman: The Black Mirror movie, but starring Dick as Nightwing, not Batman. 




 I'd love to see Spider-Man as a mockumentry made by MJ.
