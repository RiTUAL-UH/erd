 there is no promotion, there's only buying in 




 they do seem behind the curve when compared to the other Florida teams 












































 Sorry. I knew there'd be jerks but I kinda assumed there'd be more folk to read it   be smart about it. 





























 there are plenty of good writers covering individual teams, a print subscription magazine coupled with a free alt digital version would really be a boost to the fans.

It would just have to avoid being a trite mouthpiece like nearly all MLS sanctioned coverage

 good signings, Okafor could have a breakout year 




 feel Sanfilippo will leave a bit of a leadership hole. Frimpong could be very very good if he's given regular playing time 




 really liked this club. it's ownership model was very positive. too bad it wasn't enough

 I would be willing to bet that Castrillon has a green card 




 I'm really liking the flavor of this Jax team 









 I wouldn't panic. Carolina, SA,   Ft.L all have fewer players on their rosters than Jacksonville. Just means contracts aren't official yet, plenty of signings to come for all teams 









 the vast majority of NPSL players are college players so they can't get paid due to NCAA rules. nearly every NPSL team has a couple of semi-pro guys, older players or foreign players that are looking to keep sharp   move up. the costs for a NPSL club are mostly grounds, staff,   kits 




 this is a good pick up, he's the kind of forward that could really excel in NASL 














 superb signing. the attack looks really strong, but I still worry about the defense 














 I also found Goodreads to be a great help 




 I prefer rather subdued covers, but I understand where you're coming from. Check out my blog for more info on the book, and I'd definitely be will to do a review swap. Drop me a line 


































 he did. I was really surprised to see that but I suppose Ambersley   Taka will be good veteran influences on the rookies that'll make up most of the team. do we know what team St. Louis is affiliating with in MLS? 





























 agreed. I'm seeing Ibarra following a path similar to Luke Mulholland's 




 solid addition to the defense   on the side that the team was the weakest. as a former captain, he should be a good influence on the pitch 














 actually, it's about ethics in gaming journalism 






















































 great project idea! looking forward to getting it. 


































 I don't mind unbalanced halves of the season, but it just feels like this number is well below the minimum. 




 hmm, still feels too short of a first half of the season. think I want to see a 12-14 game half 

















































 quibble 














 no worries. I was a literary editor for ages on my own book review magazine. Always read smart work from smart people littered with typos   glitches. Just have to comb through it with stranger's eyes.

it's difficult to express just how embarrassed I was/am that I sent him such a lousy copy. and now it's stuck with the book. I take refuge in the fact that he did rather like the story. I mean, 4 out of 5 stars is rather okay. 




 I get entirely what you're saying   Andy was more than fair to point out the glitches. The perils of writing entirely by-oneself is exactly this. You get blurry-eyed. But, again, with this book it pretty much went from November to building up the courage to self-publish to making it available for others to read.

Hopefully I'll be able to have edit readers for Book II. I always find that when I do draft folks into reading a manuscript they don't give the nuts   bolts kind of edits I asked for, they just hand it back with "looks good" or a series of 'edits' that are really their own rewrites of the entire story.

Thanks so much for the suggestions though, I truly appreciate the engagement! 




 I enjoy books that prompt me to look things up, so that's the kind of book I tried to write. I know it's not for everyone, but I enjoy it 




 Will do better in the future. A cleaner edition than the ARC given is what is available. Though the manuscript was a NaNoWriMo project   for a once through, I thought it rather good enough to share. And then there's this: http://www.wired.com/2014/08/wuwt-typos/
