 This is a HUGE sober insight.  Authenticity IS the goal of sobriety.   









 This guy and his voters are beneath contempt. 




 I'm pretty sure, Sheriff Joe has created a few fake documents in his day. 









 That would be what it would take, too.

 It's top secret.   




 Not by much ; ) 




 I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; Monday on. my mind! 




 Good one, KJ, but you had me at Mark Twain. 




 I can only speak for myself--but, early only (and thankfully) I got involved in AA, mostly because I was afraid of what I mistakenly imagined AA to be--a bunch of old men shaking over styrofoam cups of coffee on folded chairs presided over by the Jayzus-cult.  I was so willing and open minded at that point in my life I was willing to try anything to get and stay sober.  So AA meetings worked for me--and, it was at an AA meeting that I encountered the idea of getting a sponsor (mine's like a Big Brother) and more importantly I found the [AA 12 Steps.](http://silkworth.net/aa/12steps.html)  Working with my sponsor and support network I "did the Steps" which is a systematic way of addressing guilt, shame, misdeeds, and my fears about my damaged relationships.  Oh, and I didn't catch religious cooties--in fact I suspect that to the consternation of some in AA meetings when I hear too much God-talk I aggressively shoot down the notion that belief or non-belief in anything or any God-like being is prerequisite to successfully working an AA program--it's not.   




 Hey, congratulations, an invite to join us on /r/dinos will shortly follow in your inbox. 




 My condolences, /u/bigndfan175.  Our journey is sadly often populated with tragic losses and ghosts.  




 I've long contended that Kasich is running for Veep. 




 I'm sure some of this is just language--but a future commitment to do something almost never worked out for me,  I need to act NOW, not later.  I am not doing to drink TODAY, NOW--and I am going to doggedly persist in that commitment to myself.  

Good luck on getting that first SOBER day, again. 




 You are so amazing, my friend!  You got your whole life going on and you radiate such good will and inspiration in your posts and comments.  I wish you many, many more sober milestones.   




 What worked for me are the simple sober actions I describe at the [Baby Steps post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  If your post is a prayer, consider these comments answers from our experience of being where you are at and finding answers.  Good luck.   




 I relapsed one time.  It cost me nearly everything I had, and very nearly my life.  One day at a time I got back to this place.  I hope you join us again soon. 




 When I started, I started with the [things I describe at the Baby Steps post at this link.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Good luck. 




 Here's where I started stopping:  [the Baby Steps.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  These are simple sober actions that helped me find my way.  Good luck to you. 




 Congratulations on your half-year SOBER.  Now, you have a running start on a whole new way of life.  Keep doing what you're doing. 
























 Good for you.  You have a lot of insight at 2 weeks, keep stepping forward and you will be astounded before long. 



















 I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad;. In the aftermath of the holiday I am super happy to do Sunday SOBER in Cleveland! 




 Congratulations, u/jski7!  An invite to join us on /r/dinos will shortly follow in your inbox. 




 Congratulations, friend, I just added you to r/dinos--you were long entitled to membership. 




 That's great! 









 When I got sober I utilized ideas that [I summarize at a post called the Baby Steps.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  What this entailed was extinguishing old reinforcements to my former drinking self and creating new reinforcement for the SOBER person I became. Early on this meant dry people in dry places.   




 This would only happen to me if I wasn't HONESTLY trying to stop drinking.  The way I was able to stop drinking and get sober first required that I get HONEST. 




 Cravings are a powerful desire for (in this instance) alcohol.  By definition a craving is an emotion which if I give into it, I reinforce.  The way to combat a craving is to substitute other reinforcements--like recovery meetings, socializing with dry people in dry places (coffee houses), pursue an athletic endeavor or other interest.  If I don't give in to a craving, the powerful desire will disappear over time.   




 I am not responsible for my disease, but I am responsible for my recovery,  You got good sober time in the past, /u/saltwatermonkey -- you can do it again.  Don't drink TODAY. 




 Great post.   




 No doubt about it.  Keep doing what you're doing. 




 Drinking dreams are such a common phenomena that there is an FAQ  mention of them. [This link will take you to a post I wrote after exchanging emails with dream researchers that you might find interesting.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2dit1m/what_do_drinking_dreams_mean/)  And, no, you do not need to reset your badge. 




 I am not drinking TODAY, fortune will play no role in that decision.  Alcohol will not magically appear in my hand or near my mouth all day. 




 I'm [with you!](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) 




 Yay!  32 is a great age to get and stay sober. 




 Congratulations--which reminds me of something they say in AA: if you skip the 4th (Steps) you'll drink a 5th.  AA humor can be deadly :D 




 I'll [start with the Parade!](http://imgur.com/ZjoPinB)  And my all my guests lined up at my house to watch the marching bands, and hoopla. 




 Failure is an option, nothing more.  Past failure is not a predictor of future failure or SUCCESS! 









 Thank you u/finally_woken  for a great and creative Check-in this week.   




 I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; Happy 4th of July! I am keeping it SOBER in Cleveland. 




 Steinman was huge in Cleveland because of Meatloaf.  I knew the CBS-Sony Exec the late Steve Popovich who signed 'Loaf and later was involved in multi-year litigation with Sony over that album.  But that was my only familiarity with Jim Steinman.  Nice track, very new wave-ish. 




 Congratulations, my friend. An invite to join us on /r/dinos will shortly follow in your inbox. 




 /r/badlawyer  









 Ow-y.   



















 Personally, I treat every day, no matter the occasion, no matter the event, no matter the friends who are there or not, no matter who's drinking or not--as one more day in which I will make a decision not to drink TODAY no matter what AND doggedly persist in the commitment to myself.  It is not lost on me that many of you are struggling, maybe even obsessing over this holiday weekend (it's Independence Day in the US)--that's natural in early sobriety.  But if you can win the daily SOBER victory future holidays, or upheavals will be much easier to handle.  Let's celebrate our independence from alcohol this weekend!  Who's in? 




 Let me be clear--life is not BORING.  Boredom is a common *emotion* in early sobriety that with sustained time sober most of us get over.  My experience is that we are well-advised to be on guard around all of our emotions in early sobriety since our alkie-thinking can use any of these sensations as an excuse for relapse, especially anger and resentment.  Good work on the 15 days sober! 
























 I am so proud to be a member of this community.  Thank you mods, regulars, newcomers and lurkers, too for being a part of the whole of this online SOBER movement.   




 I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; TGIF!  I am so proud to be a member of this SOBER life boat rowing towards shore from the Cleveland oars! 









 Here's the [link to the post, What do drinking dreams mean.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2dit1m/what_do_drinking_dreams_mean/)  This is also in the FAQ on the sidebar. 




 Thank you for being part of our community. ; ) 




 It takes practice but I try to never borrow tomorrow's concerns.  In fact even in the midst of a shit storm, if I can find the presence of mind to inventory my exact situation, I can manage pretty well.  I'm not perfect, but a lot better than I was just a few years ago.  It's how I handled being criminally prosecuted for tax evasion, how I handled being sentenced to prison, how I handled prison and the aftermath.  I can handle the challenges of  TODAY, sober. 




 Hey /u/sweetpea122--my 4th of July plan is to go to bed sober tonight, plan to commit to staying sober all day tomorrow and I will deal with July 4th on the morning of July 4th. 




 Hey, /u/fr0ver84, been there did all that AND my wife and I continue to recover and reconcile and we are relatively happy.  Of course, all relationships are different.  Don't drink TODAY, plan not to drink tomorrow and your consistent sober actions can turn your life around.  By not making my sobriety dependent on the outcomes in my relationships, my relationships recovered with my consistent sober actions.  




 The dead-on smart but UNPOPULAR recovery advice is: 1. dry people and dry places; and, or 2. avoid relationships during the first year of sobriety.  Your honest post illustrates the reasons why this advice developed early on in the history of the recovery movement.   









 Most of us feel better by day 4, although some feel generally crappy for a couple of weeks.   




 For me it all boiled down to REMORSE.   




 Here's what I would do: I would not drink TODAY and plan not to drink tomorrow, too--and, through my consistent sober actions make all of the fear and concern about my alcoholism misplaced.  BTW, alcoholism is often defined as an obsession in which the compulsion to drink is but a symptom of our mental disorder.  Put another way, my drinking was only slightly less concerning secondary to my thinking disorder.  Sustained time sober changed all of that. 




 Congratulations, I had faith in you.  Good work.  Now let's go for 89+1+1+1+... 




 At the root of nearly every resentment or feeling of anger, is my fear about loss of something. 




 Good for you.  The nice thing about the 90 day challenge is that the time involved really seems to grant you considerable clarity.  Please keep posting and updating as you go along. 




 Yeah, most of us with bad withdrawal really struggle for a couple of days.  But, here's the good news: don't pick up the next drink and you NEVER have to go through it again. 




 I will not drink TODAY in solidarity with you.  Good work, my friend.   




 When I make the daily decision not to drink TODAY no matter what, alcohol is out of my movie for the day.  What other people do, what other events occur, good news or bad--none of it matters to me in terms of alcohol.  I made a commitment to myself this morning, end of story.  And as far as I am concerned there is NO FREE BOOZE or beer--somebody always pays.  The alcoholic pays with body, brain, and sometimes immediate tragedy.

I am not going to drink TODAY. 




 Congratulations!  Yay!  But, 'Rocks is a hermaphro...? 














 The drunk in the back of the cruiser is the Sheriff's deputy.   
























 I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; this is the start of my time off in Cleveland, for the 4th of July holiday and I plan on a SOBER holiday!  Have a great day, my friends! 




 I lived in Germany in the 1970s and it was HUGE.  In fact the great collector boxes are from Bear Family Records a German record company. 




 Great job.   




 My friend, as you well-know by now, I am in hot pursuit.  Congrats on the upcoming 6 years.   




 This question is not one I normally respond to, not that it gets asked all that often, but often enough.  Still today I saw a very funny Stephen Colbert interview of Eminem on a local Michigan cable access channel.  Very funny, but guess what Eminem was wearing?  [At the link, but a trigger warning as there is alcohol in a couple of the segments not involving Enimen.](https://youtu.be/rVPlMM_aSn4) 




 Welcome /u/WootTurnt to r/stopdrinking. I like to welcome the newcomers with [the link to the Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which is my way of answering the implicit question: now that I'm thinking about stopping drinking, what do I do next?  The Baby Steps are what I did and do to stop drinking and to get sober.

Good luck to you. 




 Welcome /u/BoilerKing to r/stopdrinking. There's a saying in sobriety, no one comes through the doors of recovery doing cartwheels.  I was in a similarly very dark place, in fact at 14 months sober I did a short federal prison sentence.  So this is what I did to stop drinking and to get sober:  [the baby Steps.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) Many of us on /r/stopdrinking got early traction by doing the things I lay out there.  Good luck to you. 




 Good for you, /u/turk_turklton.  Keep doing what you're doing. 














 No.  Marriage equality laws are closer in kind to decriminalization of pot and recreational drugs since each implicates personal liberty.  The GOP thumbing their noses at the SSM is bigotry and worse, is merely pandering to bigots for political purposes. 




 Which reminded me of this [story from the Bad Lawyer blawg.](http://badlawyernyc.blogspot.com/2009/11/when-you-make-closing-argument-with.html) 
























 The SALIENT point, is this point. 





























 Great post and comments, all I can add is my best wishes on moving forward and keeping sobriety a priority. 
























 I am so sorry that you are dealing with this illness but the recommendation of Al Anon *is not* a meaningless gesture.  It works.  Let me explain how it worked in my life as THE ALCOHOLIC.  My wife started going to Al Anon meetings without saying one word to me about it.  I could see and sense some sort of change come over her that I didn't understand.  When I did confront her about where she was going and what had changed she explained that it was Al Anon meetings.  Amazed and genuinely clueless, I asked her who the alcoholic was?  When she said, "You." I was floored.  The seriousness of my situation had in an instant become real to me.  And while it would be some time before I finally got sober, I could never shake the message.  In her actions to take care of herself, she communicated what ultimately I needed to hear--the unshakeable truth.  

Good luck to you. 




 Welcome /u/short_n_stubby to r/stopdrinking.  Here's where I started stopping--[the Baby Steps.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) These are simple sober actions anyone can do if you're willing.  

Good luck.   









 I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; let's keep hump day SOBER all over SD world! 
























 I have been in far darker places in my journey including federal prison, and the disciplinary court of my profession.  What did I do?  [Baby Steps](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) back to sobriety and life.  I feel like I turned it around, you can you.  Start TODAY and let's see what tomorrow brings.  We will be here to support you. 




 Have you read the [Baby Steps post?](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) When I was lost, the simple sober actions that I describe at the Baby Steps gave me a path forward.  Good luck. 




 As a rule I avoid "tests."  The only test I need to pass is the one where I decide that I am not going to drink; and I persist to bedtime.  On the otherhand my wife drinks fine wine (although she kept it out of the house for 10 months or so after I got sober again in 2009) and my wife's enjoyment of her glass of wine at supper 4-5 days a week is fine with me.  After I make my daily decision not to drink TODAY no matter what--alcohol is out of MY movie for the day.  Others drinking has NO impact upon me, and if it did I would leave the vicinity.  Nothing is going to change that today. 




 Good for you /u/5tossit23 and welcome to /r/stopdrinking.  Hey, it sounds like you got a good running start but I'll offer you the link [the Baby Steps post, anyway.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  It's what I did to stop drinking and to get sober and I share it as sort of a starting place for our newcomers.  Good luck, I hope you're here for the long haul. 




 Congratulations, my friend--I'm not going to drink TODAY,  you are showing the way.   




 Some of us experience[Post-Acute-Withdrawal Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-acute-withdrawal_syndrome) also called PAWS.  You can read up on it at the link.  The good news is that for most of us it is not a serious or longterm issue.   









 Good for you!  Keep doing what you're doing. 




 Of course, my Plan A is to find an AA meeting near where I'll be.  I've been to many cool out of the way AA meetings over the years.   




 Have an awesome time, you so deserve all the blessings after the hardwork you did over the last year and half.  I'm so proud of you.  Please stay in touch and remember, almost anywhere in the world there is an AA meeting close by should you need that feeling of being connected face-to-face. 




 For me boredom was an emotion I had to learn to dispel which I was able to do by finding new activities and sober reinforcement.  I got all of that and a path through the ups and downs of sobriety via AA meetings and activity. 




 Rule 8.4 of the ABA model rules:

It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to:

(c) engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation;

(d) engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice; 









 The problem with your thinking about this is that you are denying the clear meaning of his words.  He would not use this language unless he fully intends his audience to infer that they are free to ignore the supreme court ruling that they disapprove. 





























 Nice! 




 Lawless, lawless... 














 [Here's my first AA meeting link from the /r/alcoholism sidebar.](https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/2v573a/the_where_why_and_what_should_i_expect_at_my/) 




 Every day, a personal best! 




 Lovely!  Keep doing what you are doing. 




 Yikes, so true. 




 There's a "personal story" at the back of the Big Book called "Acceptance Was the Answer" which brilliantly makes this same point in our recovery context.  [At this link, scroll to p. 407.](http://www.aa.org/assets/en_US/en_bigbook_personalstories_partII.pdf)  This is actually a brilliant and funny story containing one of the classic passages in recovery literature. 




 Yay on 8 days SOBER!  Time to get badged-up and really become a member of our community. 




 Real peace is an inside job ; ) 




  I've tried AA but hey I'm a queer, transgender Atheist....AA isn't exactly my comfort zone.

In my neighborhood here on the westside of Cleveland, being queer, trans, and atheist might land you in anyone of 40 regular weekly meetings.  So why not consider finding an AA meeting that is close to what feels comfortable then creating an LGBT/atheist meeting? 




 I can feel this, /u/Sober_Kosh -- but AA meetings met this call to create new and effective social relationships and reinforcers for my sobriety.   I am an ex-drinker and when I recognized and accepted that fact, I abolished cravings. 




 Well-done.  You know how I shut down the alkie thinking?  When a thought occurs to me, I go: oh, yeah, but not TODAY because I made a commitment not to drink TODAY.  For me it's about that daily decision not to drink, and as my pal /u/offtherocks said, dogged persistence in keeping the commitment. 









 I think this is a great idea. 












































 The GOP is not racist, but it's number 1 with racists. 




 I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; I'm keeping Tuesday SOBER all day!    



















 I confess, I relish stories of BigLaw Firm misconduct and criminality.  IMHO they do shit like this all the time but are rarely caught and prosecuted for the vermin that they are.
