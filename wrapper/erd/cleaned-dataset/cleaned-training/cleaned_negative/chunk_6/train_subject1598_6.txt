 Prefer metric dimensions.

Building shelves between two stud walls. I want the bottom shelves to be a bit bigger for any oversized books, but not sure if all the shelves should get smaller as they go up. So, from bottom to top:

* 30cm, 30cm, 28cm, 26cm, 24cm, 24cm, 24cm, 24cm
* (= 11.8", 11.8", 11", 10.2", 9.4"", 9.4", 9.4", 9.4")

or 

* 30cm, 26cm, 26cm, 26cm, 26cm, 26cm, 26cm, 26cm
* (= 11.8", 10.2", 10.2", 10.2", 10.2", 10.2", 10.2", 10.2")

[shelves are 2cm (~0.8") deep]

[Floor to ceiling = 244cm (~96")

[First shelf will be 10cm (3.9") up (mid way up skirting)]

[Last shelf is 30cm (11.8") below ceiling, but will probably not have anything on (28cm for second option)]

 An interesting survey. A few thoughts. 

My big issue is the first question's first answer is such a rabble rouser - it's written in such a manner as to make your average polled-person in Palestine want to answer to "reclaim all historic palestine from the river to the sea" (words like "reclaim" seem aimed at trying to make this a high figure - and the Washington Institute has certainly been accused of bias before).

That aside:

* 70% of Gazans believe Hamas should maintain a ceasfire with Israel (28% disagreed).
* 57% of Gazans believed Hamas should renounce violence (38% disagreed)
* 64% believed levels of delay and restrictions at checkpoints were a "significant problem"

Those are your moderates. They are the majority.  




 The current situation shows the blockade **doesn't work**. It's not prevented missiles getting into Gaza. All it has done is increase the number of people prepared to fire them. 

The Israeli Iron Dome is a fantastic solution, and I hope they continue to strengthen and improve it. I have no issue with border checks, but the blockade has banned too many non-military items: http://www.economist.com/node/16264970

* cement
* iron
* wood

While these items can no doubt be put to nefarious purposes, they are necessary for a country to rebuild. 
 




 What a weird thing to say.

Dresden was a crime by the British which did little to advance the war effort. Even so, Goebbels further massaged the casualty figures to encourage the German war effort. You couldn't radicalise the Germans because all the men were already conscripted to fight the war. 

You might care to look at the impact of the US-British-led invasion of Iraq, or the US in vietnam to see how ordinary people become radicalised very quickly by conflict.  




 Just as Israel's citizens tend to vote for more hawkish parties during conflict, so did the people of Gaza - they voted for the people they *perceived* would bring them security. It's not a case of people abandoning terrorism (people become indoctrinated), it's about stopping (or reducing the number of ) new people from joining. 




 There is a short term and long term problem here - and the solutions to them are clashing badly: 

The short term problem is that Hamas has the capability and intention to strike out at Israel (though let us note that there have been thankfully few Israeli civilian casualties). This is the problem that Israel is trying to solve through a ground invasion of the Gaza.

Israel's long term problem is much the same, except that invading Gaza radicalises more moderate Palestinians, drives more support (and weaponry) from other Middle Eastern countries, and damages any hope of a proper peace settlement which is the **only** long term solution. 

Now opening up the Gaza comes with huge risks, but it does help to allow Palestinians to live normal lives - provides them with jobs, allows them to make money, and increases the opportunity cost of war for the normal Palestinian - pushing them away from groups like Hamas.  




 Hamas does have capabilities to shoot rockets. It's a terrible thing. International pressure needs to continue to push them to disarm. 
BUT
The blockade disproportionately hurts Palestinian civilians, it prevents basic provisions reaching the people who need it. It prevents people working and making a peaceful living. Ultimately it helps radicalise ordinary people to join militants within Hamas' ranks.

I also assure you that MANY people give a fuck about MH17, the Malaysian airlines plane shot down over rebel held areas of Ukraine. I also give a fuck about the current Israeli-palestine situation as I do not see either sides tactics making life safer in the long run for either side.  




 I thought ISIS had realised their mistake and rebranded as IS (Islamic State)

 My Error. My board is actually:
MSI P67A-GD65 (B3)

If I replace the board I need one with 8 internal Sata ports 




 100ish? 









 When the problem comes about it will happen every day until I switch the SSD to a new Sata port.

I need a Socket 1155 board, they hopefully should be too expensive. 




 My Mobo has 4 Sata2 ports and 4 Sata3 ports. In them is plugged:
- 2 x DVD Drives
- 4 x Storage HDD
- 1 x SSD with Operating System

Every few months I'll start having problems loading windows, which is fixed by changing the SSD from one Sata3 port to another one. Leading me to believe the Sata Ports are screwed. 

- Could this be a BIOS issue?
- Is there a fix without replacing the board
- If I replace the board, which Socket 1155 board [no onboard Gfx plz] would be a good option? (the CPU and Memory are fine for me).

I do have an amp, but my friend reckoned that active speakers were better value for money. Thoughts? 














 A few things to address. The first is that we use the many methods you mention **alongside** animal research. You use the most appropriate method for the question you want to ask. All these methods have advantages and disadvantages - so cells cultures are great for understanding a basic drug interaction, but falls short if you want to understand how a drug will move around an entire living organism. 

94% of drugs are not found safe and effective in animals, they are found safe **enough** to move to Phase I clinical trials. This happens having already passed tests in cell cultures and computer models.
Around 88% of the drugs found safe **enough** in Phase I clinical trials, still fail in later human trials - so it is not a case of the failure of our models, just the difficulties of drug development. 

I recommend reading this:

 There has been some pretty impressive non-animal techniques aimed at helping countries like China remove their need for cosmetic testing
http://www.ibtimes.com/first-human-skin-sample-grown-lab-could-artificial-epidermis-end-animal-testing-1576882  



















 1. Theft, by any normal definition, is depriving someone else of their property without their consent - it has nothing to do with the threat of violence (which would be closer to "mugging").
2. Your taxation=theft argument relies on a newly created, non-standard definition of theft
3. I think many people don't object to paying their tax (I don't - I get great services for it). I don't pay more than I owe - I pay what I owe - for the services rendered.
4. People don't pay more than they owe in tax because they don't get any additional benefit from doing so. It would simply lead to free-riding by others. 




 Some of the terminology below is specific to the UK

Many large firms avoid paying tax by clever methods such as inter-firm lending and settling headquarters in tax havens. So my idea was:
Firms with a turnover of 20 million or less are unaffected, continuing to pay corporation tax on profits
Firms with a turnover of over 20 million pay whichever is greater out of X% of profits (based on corporation tax) or 1% of turnover (could be less than 1% if necessary). 

This means there is no way of avoiding tax altogether. Providing your turnover was based on sales in the UK (or whichever country we are discussing) you would be liable to tax. You could not fake low profits through inter-firm lending, or such like, to avoid tax.

Thoughts?

 This is ridiculous. Sabin, a very famous researcher, was hugely in support of animal research and PETA are trying to make it sound like he wasn't. Read Sabin's own words:
"In a recent letter to the Journal (Misrepresenting Research, Feb. 20), Dr. Stephen R. Kaufman, the chairman of the Medical Research Modernization Committee, correctly quoted my 1984 testimony before Congress but he drew wrong conclusions from it.  Dr. Kaufman was also wrong when the said the polio vaccine was based on a tissue culture preparation  not animal experimentation.

On the contrary, my own experience of more than 60 years in biomedical research amply demonstrated that without the use of animals and of human beings, it would have been impossible to acquire the important knowledge needed to prevent much suffering and premature death not only among humans but also among animals."

 I love ERV sometimes:
"If you gave a Foodie with ADHD a LOT of cocaine, and said, Make a movie about food, they would make Food Inc" 




 The scientist believes animal research is important, and writes something which criticises some particular aspect or shortcoming of testing
PETA quote out of context to suggest the researcher believes animal research to not be of any use.
The reddit article picks up on those misrepresentations.

Not quite sure how this supports PETA's side of things. 



















 Hidden House Rules - I take Fleet Street 




 My first ever journal article - not only discussing the impact of the animal rights movement on medical science, but also creating a sociological model to explain the motivations and structure of the animal rights movement. 
























 I don't use contactless cards - but the endless warnings about card clash have replaced the old warnings about minding the gap 




 No, it's a new problem since you could use contactless visa cards instead of an oyster. So if you slam your wallet on the reader, the machine can take money from both your oyster and your contactless visa card 
























 A good view on both sides. The only thing I take issue with is the 70 million - I'm not sure where that figure comes from but looks to be higher than the reality. 




 Interesting article, but flawed:

1. USDA covered animals account for under 1 million animals per year. If you add mice and rats you are unlikely to reach more than 20 million:
http://speakingofresearch.com/facts/statistics/

2. The reality is that this statistic has been taken out of context. A good explanation is written by Prof Robin Lovell-Badge here, explaining it:
http://speakingofresearch.com/2013/01/23/nine-out-of-ten-statistics-are-taken-out-of-context/

3. Is correct - and something I personally disagree with, but do not think that being AWA exempt, exempts them from all regulations:
http://speakingofresearch.com/facts/research-regulation/

4. This is true, and something I think needs to change BUT it contradicts Fact 1. 1 million animals ARE counted, so if 90% are not, then the total would be 10 million not 100 million (in truth around 95% are probably not counted).

5. I agree that cosmetic testing should be banned worldwide. 

6. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee exists, in part, to ensure animal research does not go ahead where there are viable alternatives. In the EU this is written into the laws governing animal research.

7. Possibly true, but such environmental research is often done on fish larvae, where thousands may be killed at once, although they are not properly formed and are unlikely able to feel pain at this point.

8. Draize tests (eye irritation) are rarely performed, and are done WITH pain relief. At least in the US and EU.

9. If you don't test pregnant animals you end up with disasters like Thalidomide.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalidomide

10. Cosmetic testing does need to end. Many countries are phasing out household products as well.

11. Yup - though they don't exist for most research
 




 Be careful not to anthropomorphise animals - they are not human. An animal is not in a testing lab thinking of all the other places it can be. And outside a lab is no utopia. 
Inside a lab they have warmth, food, shelter, veterinary care etc. However, they also will suffer (if only from being confined). Nonetheless, they do not have to worry about predation, starvation, thirst, freezing to death etc.
