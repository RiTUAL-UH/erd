 As for "liberating the concept of authority," why muddy the waters? Will you "liberate" the idea of the curve to talk about straight lines?

No, of course not.  But this is just sloppy rhetoric - the relationship between authority and individual or communal autonomy is not necessarily one of mutual exclusivity, as the relationship between straight and curved lines is (i.e. although any line that is curved must not be straight, some instances of authority may also be instances of autonomy).

Incidentally, there is obvious value in contrasting curves and lines when discussing one or the other.

You keep saying that you are familiar, but your basic problem with my position seems to be that you object to an "anarchy" that is as radical as the word sounds.

I don't believe that I have objected to any particular anarchist idea in this thread.  I have rejected some points of view about how one can and cannot rightly describe anarchist ideas, but I don't believe this results in a limitation on what can be described.

The anarchy of the anarchist tradition is arguably even more radical than the word sounds. We live in the midst of disorder, so nobody is likely to be scared of that, though they may not wish to increase it. But anarchy means approaching the way we live together in an entirely new way, which should scare us a little.

It seems to me now that you don't have any logical objection to my reframing.  Instead, you reject it as a useful endeavor on the grounds that anarchism *should* sound objectionable to sheltered middle class liberals (or whoever it is who might find a reframed anarchism more palatable) - not on the grounds that my reframing misrepresents any particular *idea*, but on the grounds that it doesn't feel objectionable enough.

So why shy away from the word that expresses our desires and invokes an appropriate level of discomfort?

Why frame my effort as cowardice?  My goal is to consider new ways of discussing anarchist ideas with those who would reject them if discussed in the dominant vocabulary, because I believe (and here, assume) that spreading true understanding of anarchism is a good thing.

 




 Huh...thanks, I guess.  At least half the words in your post add nothing to your meaning.

You say:

any element anchored in will-to-power will quash elements that are not

Why is this so?  What specific elements will quash what other specific elements, and how is this a certainty? 




 That hardly seems like a reason to stick with the word 'anarchism'.

"Any car you buy will eventually break down - so why bother replacing your broken car with a new one that can drive?" 




 The subject of this thread is the language used to communicate anarchist ideas - in particular, the possible drawbacks of the word anarchist itself.  The topic is not "humanispherian please teach train_subject1632 about anarchism, they're using words wrong."  I am here to consider how anarchist ideas could be communicated with alternate language, so as to more effectively communicate these ideas to groups that have difficulty understanding the existent dominant vocabulary.

I am familiar with every topic you just invoked, and I am certainly not suggesting that voluntarism and anarchism are equivalent, nor that capitalism + voluntarism is anarchism.  It isn't just not anarchism - it's not conceivable, as the blanket adoption of capitalist ideals can only occur through coercion.

Why not liberate the concept of authority and use it to talk about anarchism?  I see no particular reason not to, when communicating with an audience that sees authority as necessary or desirable. 




 You did not understand what I said.  You are assuming that I am using the word authority in the same way you are, which is obviously not the case if you actually read and understand what I just wrote.

Your statement is equivalent to saying that there is oppressive power in allowing individuals to consent or withhold consent without coercion, and to decide what they do with themselves and other consenting individuals. 




 I disagree, but suspect this is only a disagreement born in semantics.  If authority is distributed to such an extent that any person's authority is simply over their own consent and behavior, that hardly seems different from abolishing authority so that individuals may govern their own behavior (and each others only through consent). 




 That is a far less bold and sweeping claim than you led with a few comments above.

It seems to me that there is no necessary connection between order and a hierarchy of centralized, violent authority.  Anarchy is not about inducing chaos - it is about decentralizing authority by removing hierarchy.  Authority rests with individuals, or groups of individuals (communities).

People are not naturally inclined to chaos; they are naturally inclined to order.  Because of this, various anarchist political theories are actually quite practical - in the absence of oppression, a set of sane, sensible, equitable social orders can emerge in a decentralized, human process.

I don't see anything about that that particularly implies a loss of order - only a replacement of the mechanisms by which order is maintained.

 




 We may have our problems but it's no where near on the same scale.

I don't believe that it is, and I'm not alone in that belief.

Read some history.

I have a decent education in the recent history of the United States, including the civil rights movement of the 1960s and the many race riots that have followed up until the present day.  It is quite arrogant of you to assume that I am ignorant of history simply because I disagree with your beliefs about the prevalence of racial violence over the last ~50 years.

If you wish to assert that systemic racism has been substantially diminished over the last 50 years, perhaps you should cite some data to back that assertion.  History does not seem to support your view. 




  Not a single one of those other labels actually indicates what is radical about anarchy. And, of course, each comes with it's own baggage. We're not going to sell anarchy to people with closed minds by wrapping it in some seductive packaging. If they bought into something that they thought was "nice-sounding," they're likely to experience a pretty serious case of remorse when they realize just what anarchy really is. 

I disagree.  There are plenty of labels that capture the meaning of anarchy as well as anarchy does without invoking the negative frame and connotation of that word.  The plain synonym "non-heirarchy" even does this reasonably well.

And why should a person feel remorse, having learned the true meaning of non-heirarchical political theory?  There is nothing about it that necessitates chaos, violence, or anything else that a modern social liberal should find surprising from an ideology so named.

Your rhetoric sounds appealing, from a certain point of view, but I don't see any particular reason to believe it. 




 Nope. 




 I've had a good experience using L-theanine to induce mild relaxation.  For nausea that doesn't originate in the GI tract, very low doses of cannabis work better than anything else I've come across - far better than any non-prescription anti-nausea drug.  If you don't already use cannabis, the dose should be incredibly low.

I can't recommend combining all the things you listed, especially the last two, with each other and your SSRI.  5HTP, in particular, is [not safe to combine with an SSRI](http://pennstatehershey.adam.com/content.aspx?productId=107 pid=33 gid=000283#Precautions) at all. 




 There also used to be a time where police dispensed street justice, beating the shit out of people that talked back or were standing on the wrong corner.

That time is now, and has been for decades.  It just doesn't happen often to the privileged middle class people that make up much of the population of Reddit; they have to actively research to learn about police brutality, instead of it being an ever-present threat in their daily lives. 




 Coconut oil actually raises blood levels of both forms of cholesterol; this article claims that it only raised levels of HDL, which is false.  It does increase HDL more than it raises LDL, and so has a positive effect on cholesterol balance.  But major health organizations generally say that more research is required before coconut oil can be recommended as a major fat source in the diet, because it may present a cardiovascular risk - it might be bad for you, it might be good for you, but we don't know enough to say.

[This article has a cite for the effect on HDL/LDL](http://www.webmd.com/diet/coconut-oil-and-health?page=2) 




 That sounds appealing in a way, but it obfuscates the fact that one could use different words to impart the same ideas without also evoking the same frame or connotation.

To give a simple example, we could use all the same definitions and political theories, but call anarchism non-hierarchical democracy (or some similarly nice sounding semi-novel term).  It would convey the same meaning, but would not evoke in privileged white liberals the idea of chaos and disorder, black blocks and burning cars, etc.

This could make it easier to convey the actual meaning of some set of anarchist ideas to people who would not otherwise be able to keep an open mind long enough to understand. 




  I quite thoroughly think that the more egoistic elements of Anarchism must fundamentally come to grief with the social elements by their general outlook.

Would you elaborate on this?  What particular elements are you referring to? 




 There isn't anything on that page that could be construed as a claim that this "isn't studied in the west because you can't patent mushrooms."

Also, the author appears to have been on faculty at a university in Israel at the time of publication.  Israel is not an Asian country. ;)

So what are you asking us to debunk - your unfounded assumptions about this research?  You didn't offer any statement actually found in or supported by the linked article. :P
 




 I build my own cables from parts I buy at redco.com, and audio parts supply store.  If you have basic soldering skills and you're making at least a few cables at once, you can get the same or better cables than you would have for ~1/4 the price + 15 minutes of easy work. 




 Section 4A001.a.1 of the DSGL lists electronic computers and related equipment, electronic assemblies and specifically designed components that are specially designed to operate at an ambient temperature below 228 K (-45C) or above 358 K (85C). Software and technology for the 'development', 'production' and 'use' of these computers is controlled.

Sounds kinda like my graphics card :-/ 




 There's nothing to debunk; this is peer-reviewed scientific literature, and its claims are likely to be true (and also quite specific and modest). 




 They suggested that I be a marine biologist or astronomer...didn't see a hint of military anywhere. 




 Well, you sure called that bluff... : / 




 That hardly seems like a charitable interpretation.  You darn libertarian Daoist metaphysicians and your irreverent remarks. 




 Haha - I can see you've considered the evidence for neurotoxicity already.  You seem to have the odds in your favor - I hope all goes well, and that there is no cumulative damage. :) 




 That's high enough that you should be concerned about single dose neurotoxicity.  If you're set on doing this, you should be certain to keep hydrated and keep yourself from overheating during the experience, and should not dose again with another psychedelic or amphetamine for the following week or so.

I must respectfully disagree with Quasarstoquark's somewhat carefree assessment of the risk.  There is good enough reason to be quite cautious about doses much higher than 100-150mg, and there is no good reason to believe that it is safe to combine MDMA with LSD, or to take it soon after 5-Meo-DiPT.  The stakes are very, very high - acceptable risk should be quite low. 




  I have no doubt it's LSD

Why?

Without testing it, you likely have no idea whether it is LSD or another psychedelic - potentially a novel, dangerous one - that can be laid on blotter.  You can't reliably tell by trust, appearance, size, print, taste, nor by effect unless you've compared a known sample of LSD to a known sample of not LSD.  And to obtain a known sample you have to test.

Testing kits are quite inexpensive if you plan to buy LSD a dozen times or so in the next few years.  Even if you only use it a few times, it's probably worth $10 or $20 to avoid taking a dangerous novel substance instead of LSD. 




 You can actually read the full text of the papers published in Nature that are linked in the article, by clicking the citations at the end.  It's a complicated story, spread across several studies...the short version: there's a source of trace nitrogen in the medium the yeast are grown in.

As for resonance - there's no contradiction, as biological systems are known to commonly produce molecules that exhibit resonance from molecules that don't. 




 I think you missed the point.  If making morphine were as easy as home-brewing, few people would be willing to spend very much money on it. 




 Easier than developing this technology, sure.  But not easier in the long run on a $ / dose basis.  It takes a lot of poppies, which have to be grown for months, in dirt, with fertilizer and water and sun and so on.

Yeast are far easier and cheaper to produce: air, water, sugar, and a few days to a week from inoculation to harvest.  If they make an comparable amount of morphine by dry weight, the yeast production will certainly be more efficient once developed. 




 No kidding!  All it would take is one tiny sample, liberated by one sympathetic (or entrepreneurial) graduate student, to populate every willing clandestine morphine brewery on the planet within a few years.

Beyond that, it's likely that within a few years the techniques of GMO yeast production would be within reach of a DIY bio lab anyway. 




 The difference between 2 and 4 grams is huge.

For many, 2 grams of shrooms will induce a mild intoxication with light visual distortions, not unlike a moderate dose of cannabis - while 4 grams will induce a full on psychedelic trip, complete with objects morphing into other objects, near death experiences, and all kinds of strange things you can't even imagine not having experienced them.

I recommend starting with 1.5 to 2 grams, considering your situation.  Don't worry - just start small, and you'll have plenty of space to venture into this gradually. 




 Angry people aren't very good at identifying workable solutions to complex problems, nor at convincing others to change their views.

It seems reasonable enough to me, to be in favor of progressive taxes and also the removal of tax exemptions for wealthy entities.  I don't see any particular reason to group these two issues.

But I don't think your interpretation of Rand Paul's proposed tax reforms is accurate. 




 Pshhhhh 




 I've read that after a few days it can be dangerous due to mold, but other sources claim you can just boil it all the way down to a resin. I would assume boiling everything away except the alkaloids would leave you with a bacteria / mold free product.

Well, you're assuming that boiling it down to a resin *would* boil away anything but alkaloids - which isn't true.  All kinds of stuff will be left over.  If the brew contains toxic secondary metabolites from bacterial or fungal growth that occurred over the last year, it's likely that some of these will remain.  There may even been viable endospores in the remaining substance, which could germinate in your stomach and grow out until they [explode through your chest](https://youtu.be/LsD6AL3HJtM?t=43s) and devour all your friends.

Since cacti are relatively cheap, and easy to obtain in the wild in many regions, you're probably better off seeking out new material. 




 A flat tax doesn't mean there are no deductions.  Part of Rand Paul's proposed flat tax is to remove almost all tax loopholes, which would raise the effective tax rate for many wealthy entities (individuals   corporations) by eliminating their ability to shelter income from taxation.  At the same time, it could well decrease the effective tax rate for many working class people, by offering them a higher default deduction (which would still exclude the poorest people from paying any income tax at all).

Your post betrays intense anger and frustration which, I think, has impaired your ability to accurately comprehend the ideas you claim to be rejecting.  What if you're wrong, and a flat tax could actually be a good way to achieve ends that you would like to see in society? 




 Interesting...  I don't know what synthesis engine it uses; I couldn't find a schematic and wasn't able to figure out how the synthesis worked, though I have identified which boards perform it.

Any ideas?  I could take photos if you're interested. 




 **Printed bases remove the problem of logistics**

...

:/ 




 If you're not here to debate the topic of the OP, leave.  The start of the debate does not need to be a question. 




  ...in generating a drug source that is self-replicating and easy to grow, conceal and distribute, the work could also transform the illicit opiate marketplace to decentralized, localized production. In so doing, it could dramatically increase people's access to opiates.

Oh no! :O 




 I understand the effect you're replicating; in my experience, it is present but never so obvious and overwhelming.  Even at very high doses, other visuals will come on much stronger and overwhelm the visual field before this became so marked. 




 Well, you do seem to have given this some thought - and I certainly don't intend to insult your intelligence.

But what I said about the small chance of you totally freaking out and endangering yourself isn't dependent on your approach or attitude towards psychedelics.  People with perfectly sane approaches and mature attitudes have terrible experiences sometimes.  Some people only have terrible experiences on psychedelics, and therefore cease use after a few tries.  You don't know - you could be such a person.

MDMA is a drug with an intense positive push - it does have some effects that are similar to some effects of psychedelics, but it is really quite a different beast.  It's difficult to have a bad time on MDMA unless you can't tolerate stimulants, or you take it a stressful environment, because MDMA is an inherently pleasurable drug.

Anyway, I don't mean to say you shouldn't do this, nor to be a complete bummer.  But I didn't see this perspective being presented at all and I feel that it should be considered.

Wish you all the best in this. :) 




 Well...you should understand that there is some risk involved.

You don't know how you will react, and you don't have any guarantee that the dose is accurate.  Most people have a reasonably good time on LSD, but occasionally a person will totally freak out and do all kinds of strange, potentially dangerous things.  That is why it is generally best to have someone accompany you when you first use psychedelic drugs - in particular if the dosage is unknown (as yours is, as you cannot measure the amount of LSD in your tab and lack strong evidence that it is accurate).

Consider the possibilities.  Is a very small risk of totally catastrophic results worth taking in this case?  What alternatives are available to you? 




 Yes, it can - sometimes modestly, as in the case you mentioned, and other times quite dramatically.

If you're curious to learn more about this, consider reading about the [variable bioavailability of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3189735/).  This somewhat popular supplement has terrible bioavailability by default, but has been studied enough that the causes are understood and can be effectively addressed. 









 More dangerous than what?  It's more dangerous than cold storage, but it's clearly intended to host a spending wallet - they aren't competing solutions. 




 :/  The brain itself is about 60% fat - not omega 3's in particular, just fat.

The highest estimate I have seen suggested that ~8% of the brain, by mass, is composed of omega-3 fatty acids. 




 That isn't true...and it's especially objectionable for a sub devoted to skepticism to tolerate baseless attacks by people who haven't even bothered to hear the argument being condemned. 




 Awful joke. 




 Why do you say that? 




 ~~Plutocracy is a form of oligarchy. :/~~

Derp nvm just understood what you meant. 




 Yes - there is no practical takeaway from the literature reviewed in this video, as common organic pesticide metabolites were not tested for.  What if those graphs had included such metabolites?  We might have seen inverted curves showing a shift between different urinary pesticide metabolites as subjects changed between organic and conventional diets, instead of a reduction. 




 I disagree with SugarRush - there is no cause for concern about theophylline.  It has a similar safety profile to caffeine; it is only a few atoms away from *being* caffeine, and occurs naturally in tea and coffee in trace amounts.  It is present to fill the role guaifenesin fills in Bronkaid (to help loosen mucus in the lungs).

However, you should break the tablet in half, or even quarters to start.  48mg of ephedrine is approximately two times the usual dose in the EC stack.  You don't want to overdo this - you can hurt yourself.

Using a half tablet gives you about 100mg of theophylline, as well.  ~300mg is a typical dose for a teenager with asthma.  A healthy adult can take this without too much concern - certainly less concern than a healthy adult taking yohimbe + caffeine! 




 :/

The video poses a clear and precise question, comparing organic foods to conventionally grown foods through a literature review.  If you can't bother to watch the video, don't comment. 




 Psilocybin mushrooms don't usually turn a person's eyes red.  Perhaps you rubbed your eyes and forgot about it, or you have seasonal allergies you aren't aware of.

Many people find that tripping through the transition to night-time can turn a trip dark.  You might be happier starting your trip in the late morning, so that you are done by nightfall.

However...psychedelic drugs have a dark side that you can't just avoid.  You will feel discomfort, fear, confusion, and other unpleasant things from time to time when you take psychedelics.  They aren't like marijuana, alcohol, MDMA, etc, which can offer a consistently pleasurable experience time after time if you get the setting and dose right.  Psychedelics will sometimes confront you with things you don't like, through no fault of your own.

Of course, sometimes you'll notice that something in the environment is making you feel bad, like an ugly noise or dark shadows or a person you feel uncomfortable about.  It's good to change those things immediately (move away from the noise, excuse yourself from the person's company, turn on a light) so you don't feel bad.

But other times, you'll feel bad for no apparent reason.  Unconscious fears often come to the surface on psychedelics; death-like experiences are common.  Scary stuff happens.  You can learn a lot and grow and change etc, if you're open to experiencing these unexplored aspects of human experience.  Or you can have some really shitty experiences trying to resist this stuff; it tends to feel a lot worse and stick around a lot longer if you push against it.

In my experience, everything that comes up on psychedelics is workable and good if you can just relax and let it happen.  Especially with psilocybin - it's a very laid back and easy molecule relative to something like LSD, but you do have to let go and allow it to work.

Or you could just lower the dose and trip in chilled out environments when you're already feeling good, basically using it like cannabis.  But that really limits what you can experience of these amazing substances. 




 I agree.  I also think that it's good to cultivate a habit of grounding one's awareness, and the sensations of the body are a very useful resource for accomplishing that.

Those sensations will be destroyed in time, like everything else you've ever known and everything there is about you.  There's no sense in opposing an experience of dissolution, or oblivion, or whatever.

But grounding in the body in daily life is a very powerful method for working with fear. 




 There's no apparent contradiction. :P 




 If he believes Noam Chomsky contradicted himself, then he should have a specific example of contradiction that we could all read and consider.  Apparently he doesn't. :/ 




 Perhaps...or, it may be that you would have had this experience if you had stopped after the first 6 months - it could just be that your brain and body react to SSRI withdrawal this way.  The dependence can happen very quickly with most drugs.

In any case, it can't go on too terribly long.  It'll pass. :) 




 Here's the kicker though: he said that it might not be withdrawal, it might be that my body needs to stay on the drug. 

Well...that doesn't make much sense to me.  Perhaps you misunderstood him?  Then again, a lot of psychiatrists don't make a whole lot of sense.  It's one of the easiest specializations you can do after med school, and tends to attract folks who weren't so great at medicine. :P

Suppose you had heart disease, and needed to take a drug to keep your blood pressure normal.  You feel better and so you and the doctor reduce the dose, but then your blood pressure rises and you go downhill.  The doctor says "well, I guess your body needs the drug" and restores the original dose.

In this case, it makes sense - your body actually needs that statin to maintain normal blood pressure.  Without it, you should expect symptoms and eventual death.

But you are not taking a statin for heart disease; you're on an SSRI, a drug whose sole purpose is to address psychological difficulty by altering the way the brain functions.

There is no reason for your *body* to needs an SSRI to function normally - except for physical dependence.  Bodily symptoms from lack of the drug perfectly match the definition of withdrawal.  Your SSRI is not treating an underlying GI condition, for example; it is either unrelated to your GI symptoms, or it is *causing* them as a withdrawal syndrome.

You know what I mean?  In the case of this drug, there is no difference between saying it is causing a withdrawal syndrome and saying the body needs it; the only reason your body could need it is because of physical dependence. 




 Physical dependence can occur without addiction.  Most definitions of addiction include an experience of craving, and many also include physical dependence.  The popular idea of physical vs psychological addiction uses physical dependence to differentiate the two.

For example, you could become physically dependent on a nasal decongestant spray if you use it daily for a week or two; you would have to keep using the spray to avoid severe rebound congestion, as the body adjusts its mucous production to the presence of the drug.  You would exhibit a withdrawal syndrome.  But you would not *crave* your decongestant, as you would nicotine if you were dependent on it. 




 Great article.  But you should review the meaning of "its" and "it's," and their appropriate usage.  Several captions use "it's," a contraction meaning "it is," in the place of the possessive form "its."

[How to use its and it's](http://www.its-not-its.info/) 




 The claimed relationship isn't quantified, and there is no citation of peer reviewed scientific evidence.  It's not even appropriate to try to debunk the supposed correlation; it hasn't been established.  But if there were a strong correlation, even that would not imply a direct relationship without further evidence (as others have mentioned). 




 Haha.  Anything that isn't a psychedelic should work, in that there should not be any cross-tolerance.

I guess it depends on your tolerance to cannabis.  Like if this were me (very occasional cannabis user), I'd just make myself a dank brownie.  But if you have a decent tolerance you'd have to dab all day to get that kind of effect, right?  Or you could do MDMA.

For a festival, I don't see that many options; you don't want to do DMT, nor ketamine or any of the other great psychedelic like drugs that don't exhibit cross-tolerance, because they're not compatible with crowded loud places. 




 There is truth to both comments. 




 What are some good ways to drop? I want to be able to trip BALLS all three days, but don't want to overdo it.
My initial plan was to take 2 the first day, 3 the second day, and 4 the last day.

I doubt that would be enough of an increase.  But I also doubt that you'd want to trip the third day anyway, having tripped balls two days in a row.  Consider tripping the first and third days, and doing something else the second day.

That said, if you are set on tripping balls all three days...

A good rule of thumb is to double the dose to trip two days in a row.  For the third day, double the second day's dose (e.g. 2 tabs, 4 tabs, 8 tabs).

You might adjust this after the second day, if that was stronger or weaker than you wanted.  For example, you trip balls day one (2 hits), trip EXTRA balls day two (4 hits), so you only take 6 hits day 3. 




 Species is a concept that we apply to populations of individuals that can interbreed and share certain characteristics.  How can a concept suffer?  That makes no sense.  Individuals suffer, not ideas.

You seem to use the word species in several different ways, in fact referring to different things.  When you say the species can suffer, you seem to mean that a particular group of individual animals will suffer; when you say a species of chicken is lost, you mean a particular breed of chickens; when you say that loss is a "loss to the species," I imagine you mean to refer to the domesticated chicken as a species.  Your argument would be more clear if you expanded your vocabulary so as to avoid confusion caused by using one word to invoke several distinct concepts in rapid succession.  It may be an effective rhetorical device in casual debate to slip referents like that, but it is not an effective means of rational discourse.

If a certain subspecies failing to maintain its population led to suffering for remaining subspecies of chickens, of course that would be lamentable as it would have caused many animals to suffer - not the dwindling population, necessarily, but those future chickens whose quality of life was harmed by a loss of genetic diversity.

But if every domesticated chicken were rendered sterile tomorrow, I would not see any problem for the chickens themselves.  Those chickens could live out their lives, and leave no offspring behind to suffer in captivity.  Where's the harm in that?  Who suffers for it?  Chickens that were never born?  The idea of species? 




 The way I see it, there is no problem with a species dying out.  Every organism will die, whether the species lives or dies.

If a species ceases to exist because enough members die that no sustainable breeding population remains, that is not necessarily worse than the species surviving in captivity.  From a human perspective, perhaps something is lost.  But a species doesn't suffer; individuals suffer.  It may be better that there be no individuals than suffering individuals. 




 Huh.  I wonder about the safety of this.  :/ 




 But why will the first person to trade useful goods for this currency do it?  Why would the first thousand?  Before people are trading it, it will be worth nothing.  If you have no plan for how it will get from nothing to so valuable it replaces fiat currency, then you have nothing, really.  That's the whole problem with introducing new currency.  You can't rhetoric that away. 




 Well, suppose that is all true - of course, I may well agree with you on all those points, yet still not be convinced that this currency would be valuable to people.  Why would anybody trade your currency for valuable goods (e.g. factors of production)? 




 Himalayan salt is a neurotoxin that closes your third eye :O 




 https://youtu.be/xefyXb5u658?t=3m40s 




 But for 5 coins to buy you a basic meal, someone has to be willing to exchange a basic meal for 5 coins.  Why would anybody do that? 




 You misunderstand.  An example of how it might function isn't what I was after - I was after some explanation of how such a currency could be expected to succeed.  If a currency has no value, it will not be used.  You have no explanation of how this currency would ever have value. 




 :/

Doesn't it seem a bit naive to think that a group of engineers who actually conceived this project and carried it to fruition didn't every stop to consider obvious alternatives before going forward? 




 Well, thank goodness we had you here to point that out.  Have you mentioned this to the people who *have actually built this*?  I'm sure they never thought of such an idea! 




 You could just emphasize all the qualities and interests you have that happen to be very common among stoners your age.

 You're both missing the point of the article.  It isn't about people leaving the country - it's about people renouncing their citizenship.  You're conflating the choice to live abroad with the choice to renounce citizenship. 




 Yay :)

It seems to me that psychedelics in general exhibit a kind of plateau effect, yielding qualitatively distinct effects at different dose ranges (instead of a quantitative increase in effects already present).

Sounds like you found the right dose. 




 Sure, but you just said remove an X.  The result would actually be something like [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_syndrome).

Oh god I hope someone doesn't shop up a Turner syndrome Drow now. :/ 




 Come on - this is not an honest attempt at rational discourse.  If you have nothing nice to say, at least say something coherent. 




 You certainly can get some like-minded people together and build a new town, and elect your own leaders.

:/

You would still be subject to all the existing laws of that state, though.  You would need to pay taxes, comply with business regulations, comply with laws about how city governments operate and conduct elections, and so on. 




 That isn't universally true - there are many cities in the United States that are laid out in a bike friendly way, either in full or in certain neighborhoods.  Many cities have protected bike lanes and dedicated bike paths along major commute lines and between residential and retail zones. 




 Even that isn't true.  There's actually a design very similar to this where I currently live (a city in the US), which affords the same degree of protection (bikes move with traffic to left turn or cross, but have protected right turns any time). 




 By setting permanent, ideal subsidy levels for the different primary markets, the value of those coins is loosely pegged to the value of the resources and labour needed to produce them.

Ok, this is interesting.  This theoretical currency's value is pegged to the value of goods.  How is that value expressed quantitatively?  In $? 




 That's an interesting piece of science fiction, but it doesn't address anything I said in that last post... :/ 




 Sounds like the kind of endeavor that can only end in tears. :'O

Better to convert it to a salt and dissolve it in an aqueous solution and plug that.  Poor solubility in water tends to undermine absorption through mucous membranes.

You can easily learn how to do the conversion by searching for things like "DMT freebase to salt".

(this is the kind of chemistry crack cocaine addicts with no high school diploma can do in a mobile home's kitchen, successfully.  no big deal) 




 So..the truth comes out :O 




 I would only accept the coins if I had reason to believe they were worth the trouble.

There is *always* a penalty for trying - this is one of the most basic concepts in microeconomics, taught to high school students etc.  The cost of lost opportunity incurred by making a choice.

If you dropped a handful of pennies on a dirty floor, would you pick them up one by one, or just sweep them into the dustbin?  Is a minute of your time worth 4 cents?  To make a rational judgement about this, you need some conception of what *else* you could do with that minute.

I could obtain darkcoin or litecoin or dogecoin or monopoly money with very little effort - yet I have none.  I can obtain bitcoin, but only by spending a decent amount of money - and I have some.  Why?

The bitcoin seemed worth my time and money; the dogecoin did not.  The bitcoin was worth it primarily because other people figure it's worth it (i.e. it has exchange value) and it's very easy to transfer and hold.

I'm curious about your idea of obtaining coin only through transactions with verified entities.  Perhaps this could create some kind of value?  Can you explain how you see this functioning in a concrete example? 




 I disagree that the exceptions have anything to do with hate speech.  Perhaps this is just a semantic disagreement (i.e. we may disagree about what words to use instead of what is true), but it seems to me that the main point of the article is that hate speech is an ill-defined term from which no legal exemption from freedom of speech protection can be derived.

There is a connection between unprotected speech and hate speech sometimes, because sometimes hate speech *is* unprotected.  But the speech's unprotected status is always due to some other cause; the *exception* has nothing to do with hate speech. 




 You can do it! :D 




 The author goes on to discuss many specific cases of unprotected speech that were hate speech, but were specifically unprotected for reasons other than being hate speech.  He uses sets of cases to demonstrate specific general principles used to exempt speech from First Amendment protection in court - none of which has anything to do with hate speech in particular, though they may exempt speech that happens to be hate speech.

The article does not imply that there is never any connection between hate speech and unprotected speech - it in fact discusses at length the many ways that hate speech *can be unprotected speech*.  But it does show how hate speech is not unprotected *because it is hate speech*, because the First Amendment provides no such exemption. 




 The article discusses this exact point. 




 Makes sense to me.  Or if you plan to work out in the afternoon, you could delay until then; it's a great pre-workout stimulant.  But I wouldn't take it after the latest hour when you'd be down to drink a cup of coffee (whenever that is for you). 




 Why would anybody value this currency?  Bitcoin has potential because it has value - many people voluntarily exchange $ for bitcoin every day.  Arguably, this value is the result of a carefully planned and executed system of scarcity-regulating mechanisms (mining) and utility of the network as a cheap, convenient means of exchange.  This leads to perceived value because people have a reason to use the software as it is, and must obtain bitcoins to use it - yet bitcoins are scarce.

If your currency appeared tomorrow, who would care?  It seems like a lot of poor people might have some numbers in an account, and have an incentive to unload them - but where would anybody else get an incentive to trade valuable goods for these poor people's novel digital currency? 




 I thought the whole point is that they're building a physical space to layer VR over, for example  so that the wall *would* be there.. 




  guaifenesin 

If you're concerned, follow the recommended dosage on the package and don't combine with other drugs besides reasonable caffeine use.  That dose is safe for folks with asthma who are otherwise healthy and not aged.

The recommended dosage on the package is probably a good place to stop regardless.  Cutting is achieved by maintaining a caloric deficit, primarily through diet, while sustaining protein intake and a scaled back lifting routine.  The supplement helps you cut calories and work out by making you feel jacked and not hungry.  Its direct effect on thermogenesis is a bonus.  It's best used as a modest aid to cutting; you start to get diminishing returns pretty damn quick as you raise the dose. 




 Sounds like a job for MDMA. 




 Ah, well...that does suggest that what you're experiencing is not particularly related to cannabis use.  If it were me, I'd give it another month dead sober to see what happens.  Mild persistent visuals are common and usually resolve with a little time. 




 How long have you had HPPD?  Have you been a somewhat regular cannabis smoker for that entire time?

I had reasonably strong HPPD for several few months after some decidedly modest psychedelic use and moderate regular cannabis use.  It remained until about 2 months after I quit using cannabis.  I still experience it somewhat readily if I smoke cannabis, but only then.

Perhaps the HPPD would go away if you stopped using cannabis. 




 A series of psychedelic experiences catalyzed the end of my time as a heavy cigarette smoker, making it much easier for me to go through with a cold turkey quit.

However, I did find I was able to start the habit again years later and become re-addicted quite easily, once the situation was right for it.

So in my experience, psychedelics did a great deal to dissolve the existent addiction.  And I did stay away from that addiction for years without much difficulty at all.  But my experience shows that they did not, for me, remove the potential to build new addictions. 




 I have some experience with this problem personally.  I've have found the psychedelic experience to be very healing, but also extremely challenging and at times quite traumatic.

I strongly encourage you to explore psychedelics, but to do so...conservatively.  Carefully.  Slowly.

/u/_space_wolf_ has a very good point, which seems true to me as well - whatever thoughts, emotions, perceptions you bring to a psychedelic experience will tend to be amplified.  In my experience, this isn't so obvious and predetermined as they stated; there seems to be a great deal of room to steer the experience, at least if you have a reasonably stable awareness.  For me, having a regular mindfulness practice has been the most helpful thing for cultivating an ability to guide my experiences on psychedelics toward relaxation and ease, and away from or through strong negative emotions like fear and panic.

I don't recommend that you begin with LSD, as it tends to be a little *more* anxiety provoking than other psychedelics in many people, and also because doses vary so widely.  One little white square may barely produce an effect, while another may blast you off into 12 hours of kaleidoscopic where the fuck did my body go tripping.

Dimethyltryptamine, I similarly don't recommend at first, because few people possess the equipment and expertise to reliably deliver accurate doses.  If you use DMT a few times, you're likely to have at least one unbearably strong experience, which could easily turn you off from this wonderful substance for life.  Better to wait until you've got comfortable with...

Psilocybin mushrooms!  These are, without a doubt, an excellent beginning for the anxiety prone would-be psychonaut.  Buy a bunch of them (1/2 oz or so), and start by taking 1.5 grams boiled into a tea, in a comfortable setting with no responsibilities or possibilities for interruption that day.

In all likelihood 1.5 grams will do very, very little to you.  So next week, try 2 grams.  Keep upping the dose by .5 as you feel comfortable, but never dose more than once a week.  Most people have some kind of interesting experience by the time they hit 2.5 grams, and some actually trip fairly intensely at that dose.  By the time you reach 3.5 grams almost anybody would be full-on tripping.  You don't ever have to go that far to get a lot out of shrooms, especially if your intent is some kind of introspective growth process.

I hope this is helpful.  Psychedelics have an incredible potential to help transform anxiety, depression, trauma, and all kinds of mental and emotional afflictions.  But they can also burn you if you approach them in a naive or careless way.  By starting slow and choosing a predictable, easy to dose psychedelic, you can ease into the experience at a comfortable pace.  No need to dive in head-first. :)

edit:  Some people insist that new psychedelic users dose with a friend or sitter.  I personally think this is insensitive advice when given to introverted or socially anxious people (whether that describes you, I do not know).  There is no harm in tripping alone, so long as you dose responsibly and ensure that your environment is safe. 




 Hello!

I have a Kurzweil Ensemble Grand Mark II that I've decided to pillage the keyboard from to convert to a standalone MIDI controller.  I hate to see the rest of the instrument go to waste, and am offering all parts except the keyboard and the board that generates the MIDI signal for whatever it costs to ship +$10 per shipment (e.g. if you're in the US, you could have all the boards and transformers for $10 + a first class parcel and a priority flat rate box).

The instrument plays fine, but some patches won't activate.  I believe all the circuits are in good working order but can't guarantee anything.

If you can think of a better place to post this, please let me know. :) 




 It seems to work fairly well for the state... :/
