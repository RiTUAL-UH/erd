 that's what I am assuming. 

 "...Four days later, the dog's owner entered the hospital with a fever and a bloody cough that became worse over the next few hours, but an initial blood culture was misidentified, according to the CDC report.

As the patient's symptoms grew worse, the test was redone and he was found to have been infected with pnumonic plague, according to the CDC report. The remains of the dog were also tested and were found to be positive for the plague bacteria.

"Frankly one of the biggest surprises of this outbreak is the source," said John Douglas, of Tri-County Health Department in Colorado and one of the study authors. "Primarily ... dogs dont get sick at all or they get a minor illness," after being infected with the plague.

Janine Runfola, of the Tri-County Health Department in Colorado and lead author of the report, explained that cats are more likely to infect humans with the disease than dogs because they exhibit more symptoms.

"For pneumonic plague a more likely scenario would be you have a cat [play] with prairie dogs and infected fleas get on the cat," Runfola said. "The cat gets sick and sneezes and coughs on its owner."

"The plague is caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis, and can infect the body in different ways. For example a flea bite can lead to infection of the glands, which is called bubonic plague -- notorious for the epidemics it spawned during the Middle Ages in Europe. Because this plague was spread from dog to owner through coughing, it developed into pneumonic plague, according to Douglas.

The plague is known to be endemic to prairie dogs in the American Southwest, which can then lead to isolated outbreaks of the disease in domestic animals or humans. 









 WASHINGTON, May 1 (Reuters) - U.S. telecom industry groups, alongside AT T Inc and smaller companies, on Friday called for regulators to immediately block parts of new stricter rules for Internet service providers, citing steep costs and threats to investment.

In a filing with the Federal Communications Commission, USTelecom Association, CTIA-The Wireless Association and CenturyLink Inc sought to block the agency's move to reclassify broadband Internet as a more heavily regulated telecommunications service and a new broad general conduct standard.

The groups and companies, which are challenging the rules in court, did not ask to pause implementation of the brightline rules that ban companies from blocking or slowing down web traffic or striking deals with content companies for smoother downloads.

The filing cites several testimonials of executives at regional and local Internet providers that the rules, slated to go into effect in June, will create costly compliance burdens and limit resources for improvements to broadband networks or new products. 
























 Mr Melon, I will undoubtedly be torturing you with questions at a later time, as I must be on my way for the moment. Thank you:) 




 now you have me farther intrigued.I seem to recall reading that some Japanese company had/is developing a new material-type solar cell that converts to usable energy without needing all those middle steps. Great, now I will spend half my day trying to find it, and gee I hope I am remembering it correctly. 




 they say you can have up to 9 units, I don't have the answer to your principle question at this moment though. Think what it will allow for those areas without electric grids though..so many possibilities.

 yea I'm not entirely certain what exactly I think of his theory; but I certainly find it somewhat plausible, and rather interesting, so I thought I would put it out here:) 




 I also saw so many positive moments; I simply will never agree that destruction of one's home city/town/village/etc by those that reside there can ever do anything that will positively make for change.

This case, the horrible damage done to Freddie Gray, while in police custody which resulted in his far too early demise..this is a case that no one can possibly argue was justifiable.

My sympathy and love goes out to those family and friends of this young man; my anger   fury goes out to those that think destruction and violence will in any way help get the now so obvious   undeniable point across that unjustified violence against black youth exists   needs to be taken seriously into account by law enforcement agencies.

Peaceful protest, particularly in this instance, is IMHO the means to a more positive end result.

 




 (A megalith is a large stone that has been used to construct a structure or monument, either alone or together with other stones. The word "megalithic" describes structures made of such large stones, utilizing an interlocking system without the use of mortar or concrete, as well as representing periods of prehistory characterised by such constructions. For later periods the term monolith, with an overlapping meaning, is more likely to be used.)

 Cleopatra's Needle is the popular name for each of three Ancient Egyptian obelisks re-erected in London, Paris, and New York City during the nineteenth century. The obelisks in London and New York are a pair, and the one in Paris is also part of a pair originally from a different site in Luxor, where its twin remains. Although all three needles are genuine Ancient Egyptian obelisks, their shared nickname is a misnomer, as they have no connection with Queen Cleopatra VII of Egypt, and were already over a thousand years old in her lifetime. The London and New York "needles" were originally made during the reign of the 18th Dynasty Pharaoh Thutmose III. The Paris "needle" dates to the reign of 19th Dynasty Ramesses II and was the first to be moved and re-erected as well as the first to acquire the nickname, "L'aiguille de Cloptre" in French.

 US military 'monitoring' Iran ship seizure
http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-32503660
 




 (Reuters) - Saudi-owned Al Arabiya television said an Iranian "force" seized a U.S. cargo ship after opening fire on it in the Gulf on Tuesday and directed it to the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas.

A Pentagon spokesman said Iranian forces had boarded a Marshall Island-flagged vessel, the MV Maersk Tigris, in the Gulf. He said the boarding occurred after Iranian patrol boats fired shots across the vessel's bow and ordered it deeper into Iranian waters.

The ship had no U.S. citizens aboard, the spokesman said, contradicting Al-Arabiya's report which said there were 34 U.S. sailors on board. He said it was traveling through the Strait of Hormuz when the incident occurred.

There was no immediate word from Iranian officials.

Iran has in the past sometimes threatened to block the strait to advance its opposition to sanctions imposed over its nuclear program.

The channel is a narrow strip of water separating Oman and Iran. It connects the biggest Gulf oil producers, such as Saudi Arabia, with the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea.

At its narrowest point, the strait is 33 km (21 miles) across and consists of 2-mile wide navigable channels for inbound and outbound shipping and a 2-mile-wide buffer zone.

 Earthquake Devastates Nepal, Killing More Than 1,900

http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/26/world/asia/nepal-earthquake-katmandu.html?_r=0 




 Q:How long do you have to work without a bathroom break? Do you have a special bottle in your cab for toilet emergencies? Do you eat while working? Do you bring your own water or thermos of coffee/tea? Do you/can you use your cellphone while driving? Do train operators have to pass eye exams, as for an automobile drivers license? Are you allowed to listen to music while working? How long do you sit and drive the train before you get a break or chance to stretch your legs? In which city aside from New York would you like to operate a train and why? What is the usual relationship between train operator and train conductor  friends or competitors? What are the special or funny ways or phrases that train operators and conductors describe passengers? Do you have special emergency equipment since 9/11? Who has the better career: train operators or bus drivers and why?

Thank you to you and your colleagues for your service and helping make New York City great!

 Posted by Darryl Mitteldorf, LCSW

Answer:
We have what is known as recovery time at the end of the lines. In the terminals, we can use the bathroom or have our lunch break, which is built into our schedule. As long as the railroad is running on time, we have time to eat, but if the we are running behind, we may not have time to eat. Eating while operating the train is against the rules, as is the use of cellphones or audio devices such as iPods. The rules in the cab are just like the laws that prohibit you from doing certain things while driving a car.

All train operators and conductors have to pass full medical exams to operate a train.

Operating a train on the Amtrak system would be appealing to me.

We work as a team for six months at a time and have the chance to build relationships, which are usually good among operators and conductors.

There are no special or funny phrases that we say about our passengers, except take care and travel safely.

Since 9/11, we are now issued a mask, just like the ones you see police officers wearing in emergency situations.

Bus operators have the same responsibilities of moving passengers safely from one point to another, but they have the added responsibility of also performing as a conductor and a station agent on their buses. Both jobs can make good careers!

All transit workers appreciate you, too. Thank you.

by John McCrae, May 1915

'In Flanders fields the poppies blow
Between the crosses, row on row,
That mark our place; and in the sky
The larks, still bravely singing, fly
Scarce heard amid the guns below.

We are the Dead. Short days ago
We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,
Loved and were loved, and now we lie
In Flanders fields.

Take up our quarrel with the foe:
To you from failing hands we throw
The torch; be yours to hold it high.
If ye break faith with us who die
We shall not sleep, though poppies grow
In Flanders fields.'

This poem has always touched me deeply. All those men, so many so very young.I'm sorry if the poppy part doesn't work for Anzac, but the sentiment..surely there is that in common?

Edit to add that going forward I shall wear a sprig of rosemary on Anzac day; thank you for the education:)

 These are listed by NBC (US based) as places to help, in case any were missed above.

World Vision

The humanitarian aid group had staff on the ground in Nepal when the quake hit. As the organization tries to locate all of its workers, the ones who are safe are reporting that the immediate needs are food, water and shelter, spokeswoman Laura Blank told NBC News.

"It's freezing outside especially at night. I can't imagine how children and families are gonna sleep tonight," said child protection specialist Rosalyn Lorin, who witnessed the quake. "They need blankets and shelter. They're now afraid to go back (to) their houses."

Those who wish to donate to World Vision can visit their Nepal page or text NEPAL to 777444 to donate $10.

Red Cross

Emergency responders from the Red Cross have been mobilized to affected areas and are especially concerned about more remote towns that have been blocked off by landslides and lost communication.

"We are extremely concerned about the fate of communities in towns and villages in rural areas closer to the epicenter," said Jagan Chapagain, the IFRC's Director for Asia Pacific. The International Federation of Red Cross is using funds to try to get aid to those cut-off areas. The organization's blood bank in the capital of Kathmandu is also operating to provide blood supplies to medical facilities in the city.

For more information, visit the International Federation of Red Cross' website.

British Red Cross @BritishRedCross
The #Nepal Red Cross have a solar-powered blood bank, built to help in event of an earthquake: http://blogs.redcross.org.uk/emergencies/2014/10/nepals-solar-powered-blood-bank-will-save-lives-deadly-earthquakes/

UNICEF

The United Nations Children's Fund already has staff in Nepal. For more information, visit UNICEF's website. People can also text "Nepal" to 864233 to donate $10.


International Medical Corps

The organization focuses on delivering medical supplies and sending teams to assist and train health care workers in crisis regions. Their team is heading to the epicenter of the quake, where they say hospitals are overflowing, and medicine and supplies are expected to be quickly depleted. To donate to their Nepal response, click here.

Save the Children

The non-governmental organization has launched disaster response on the ground in Nepal, and works specifically with children and families. Ten percent of donations also go toward preparing for the next emergency response, according to its website. To donate, visit their Nepal page.

CARE

The group has previous experience responding to landslides in Nepal, and humanitarian workers are currently in the country providing food, water, shelter and health care, according to its website. To donate, visit their NEPAL page.


GlobalGiving

The charity crowd funding site has set up a Nepal-specific page. Any donations made will support various relief and recovery efforts in Nepal. The money will first go toward immediate needs like food, fuel, clean water, hygiene products and shelter. Later, the money raised will transition to supporting vetted local organizations that are working on recovery efforts. To donate, click here.
@GlobalGiving
You can provide emergency supplies to victims in Nepal by donating to the Nepal Earthquake Relief Fund http://www.globalgiving.org/projects/nepal-earthquake-relief-fund/?rf=twtr 

FINDING THE MISSING

Here are websites to check on loved ones in the quake region:

Google Person Finder

In the search function, enter information to locate someone who is missing or found, or enter the name of someone who is missing in order to search other entries.

Restoring Family Links

The website has a list of people who have registered as alive and a list of people who have been reported missing. Affected residents can register or report here.


Facebook Safety Check

Those in the area affected by the quake will get a notification from Facebook when they log on asking them if they're safe. People can check the page to see who has checked in and let their friends know they're OK.

 http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/nepal-earthquake/nepal-earthquake-devastation-could-cost-billions-heres-how-you-can-n348301
