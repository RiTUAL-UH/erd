  "My People" - Eric Holder 




 What evidence was left out? 




 Strong-Armed Robbery is not a petty crime. Attacking a police officer in their car and attempting to take their gun is also not a petty crime. Seems you have built the wrong profile for Mr. Brown. 




 It takes more evidence to convict someone than it does to indict someone. So, if there was not enough evidence to indict, how do you think there will be enough evidence to convict? 














 This is /r/politics....everything is "Off Topic" unless its a glowing review of Obamas nutsack.  









 "Why did I never hear about this?"

It's your first day on the internet?  




 Oh, look, its the guy that Michael "the Gentle Giant" Brown was [leading to Jesus Christ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhU28gAZf9c).  




 Were the legal immigrants that waited in line for years to come to this country allowed to work, live, and send their kids to school in the US while they waited?  




 Get out of here with your rational logic.  














 A *prison sentence*.. 




 Everyone on HuffPo and /r/politics missed that part, apparently. 




 Another reason Rand Paul gets my vote.  




 "All the better to see you with, my net," grinned the President and NSA. 




 I would gladly wait on Google Fiber until summer of '15. Be thankful.

 ####Damn commie! 




 "If you want to test a mans character, give him power." 




 Also, to add to your great explanation, Republicans are for States rights. Allowing the people of a State to determine whether the minimum wage increases is more in line with Republican ideals than a blanket federal increase. So, I do not see increased minimum wage on the State level as anything that would go against what Republicans believe in.  




 Whiskey or whisky? 









 lol 




 Why did the money and jobs leave? 




 I do see, from that link, that Fergusons violent crime averages are much higher than the US average. I would like to see 30 years of crime and demographic data on Ferguson. I have heard others mention that Ferguson was not a violent town until something changed. Jobs left and crime went on the climb.I wonder what changed to cause this shift.  




 What were the demographics and violent crime rate of Ferguson in, lets say, 1990? What is the demographics and violent crime rate of Ferguson today? I am genuinely curious.  




 wonder why all the jobs left.... 














 Anyone have any invites?  




  If it's priced right, I will buy it. If it's overpriced, I won't buy it.

Yet you buy Apple products....odd. 









 But I thought Democrats were against money in politics? 









 You have said nothing to explain your position. Just sensationalist headlines. Your comments are not based in reality. My comments are based from experience and the real world.  




 The concept of false racism conjured up in your own mind? 




 What? Locked out? How many more straws do you have left to grasp over there? I implore you to ask any IT manager how many resumes they get from minorities compared to whites. You have no idea what you are talking about.  




 For example: Our company is looking for a new CIO. Not one minority has applied for it. Is it the CEOs fault that only white people have applied for the job? Lets say he got 200 resumes and out of 200 resumes only one was a minority. Should he hire that minority just because they are a minority?  




 What race is the majority in the US? If there are more white people in the US I would suspect you would see more white 'bosses'. But what do I know. Its nice to see you generalize all white people and call them all racists. You believe that all white 'bosses' base their decisions on race instead of work ethic, education, and a desire to succeed. 




 So what privilege are they losing? I see what you are saying. If a conservative does not agree with what Obama is doing he is a wacko righty. If the left does not agree with what Obama is doing...what were we talking about again? oh yea.. Bad righty good lefty..

Never really heard EW called a conservative. 





























 You are not looking hard enough, apparently. In recent days, Santa come early.

 Difference being that if Americans truly wanted to change things they could, by force if need be. Australia? well, they're just pissing in the wind. Their government will never fear the people again.

  Revisionists argue that so-called eyewitness testimony is not always reliable.

So does [The American Psychological Association](http://www.apa.org/monitor/apr06/eyewitness.aspx). 









 Will they stone you to death or give you lashes? 




 Standards like the [fake newscast from Kuwait in 1990](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTWY14eyMFg)? I have watched CNN since the late 80s and do not recall them ever having "standards".. 














 Can you point to some specific reasons why you were impressed with Clinton as Sec. of State? Just curious. 




 But no one cares unless you are a violent felon and black.  




 He's white so no one cares. His privilege is getting in the way.  




 Who elects the city officials that oversee this?  




 And no riots? No looting? No burning the city to the ground? What gives? I am sure Eric Holder is meeting with the parents and launching a full investigation.  ^^/s 




 TIL Nirvana died. 




 At one point Clinton had a chance to bomb UBL but backed out at the last minute because UBL was being visited by Saudi royalty.

*I recall this from a documentary I watched on the history of UBL and Al-Qaeda. I believe the doc was on the History Channel. I may recall incorrectly*

 Who elected him? 









 A role model for all ages. 









 It was my subtle way of backing you up while spelling it out for omeezysheezy. I hope you are having an incredible day. 




 Got you to work, allowed your favorite products to be made, allows you to post comments on Reddit, etc. but nothing you would be interested in. 




 I will upvote this .gif every time its posted.  




 You mad, bro? 



















 It has not been proven false. In fact, the autopsy is actually in-line with the officers statements and that of other witness statements that said that there was a scuffle in the car and that Brown rushed the officer. The only place it has been proven false is in the minds of the many people that rushed to judgement and falsely convicted the officer in the court of public opinion. 









 Yes but Brown was shot for assaulting an officer not walking down the street.

 Why would "my gun rights" people rush the hill to defend people that are doing anything they can to strip them of their gun rights?

 Sorta...but now we know as the US government has confirmed it to be true. 




 /r/politics = Obama's left nut. Everybody knows that. Why do you think they are not a default sub anymore?  
























 You come from a drive-thru society where you want everything to happen right when you want it to. That is not reality when it comes to politics or progress. Progress takes time. Meaningful progress takes generations.  














 No, I don't remember. I am someone that was in the streets protesting and remember millions of others protesting Bush, the Patriot Act, and the Iraq war. Bush was lambasted for the things he did. Are you too young to remember that or are you willfully forgetting? 




 Nothing is Obamas fault. I thought you knew that.

 I read somewhere there were 23 Americans on board as well.  




 And now you know why I am for smaller federal government. The larger the federal government is the harder it is to hold it accountable.  









 I agree with you, but you are not helping the /r/politics anti-GOP circle jerk. /r/politics only likes anti-GOP comments, please and thank you. 














 and we all know that Democrats do not do this. They are angels. I thank jeebus every day for Democrats. So trustworthy and always looking out for the best interests of the people.  




 No, just Ted Cruz. The man is an embarrassment to himself. 




 I wish that man would go back to Canada.  




 What kind of answer are you expecting from a sub full of Democrats?  




 and think of the property taxes that can be increased and the revenue that can generated. 




 We are not a direct democracy. Direct Democracies, even when well-intentioned, can put minority groups who have less power at a disadvantage.
