 Lawyer.  




 When do they lose the second head?  




 Fascinating.  The only ones I've ever been to have been easily accessible, this has been the most challenging one. I'm going to London next weekend; do you have the GC.  




 Yup, White Edge. Beautiful area.  




 This one is actually on White Edge. You do have a great view of Stanage from it though.
